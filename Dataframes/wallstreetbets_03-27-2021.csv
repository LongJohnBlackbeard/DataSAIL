03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°  that cash dummy if you would of bought spy calls fast at the end of day you would be up hella bank and still could of bought GME on profits. In the last 7 minutes yesterday I played SPY 394, 395, 396, 397 calls and made an easy 24k. Some of you GME players could easily make hella profit on plays and still be able to pick up GME shares and not throw all your capital at it. Been saying it for a while. But you guys rather buy and hold and hold and hold while other plays run right by you."

Not only do they have money to throw at this, they don't even have a real broker to do it with!"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,That is why there are so many ‚Äúforget Gamestock‚Äù financial articles. Retail traders are the only non-hedge fund types that have any money left
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,You haven‚Äôt even second mortgaged on GME yet? Once you get that you have to reverse mortgage on top of it

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,This is why the older investors are upset about the gme situation.  They keep screaming fundamentals but that shit doesn‚Äôt apply when there‚Äôs a short squeeze.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"What are you guys taking mortgage for? 

I am really thinking about selling a lot of my other assets. Not my land, house, cars, any other stock is growing/ has grown/ can possibly grow at the GME price growth rate."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I winced
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you want to shut up these fundamental fuckers ask them if they know what a short squeeze is. When they say yes they do, ask them to explain it. Then ask them if they believe in the fundamental mechanisms of math. 

Usually shuts them up when they actually say it themselves."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes! I went and checked out what the media is saying.  I only saw 2 out of 10 different web pages that even barely mentioned the naked shorts and squeeze situation.  No wonder the older generation is scratching their heads about what is happening.  I will buy more and hold on like my life depended on it.....because it does.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,So is close lot a penny stock it something? I can't find the ticker on motley Fool

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,It's rated at about $12. You should be good. This is what I'm moving to next if it is still low when GME finishes.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,$9.50 checking in.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'd say anything below $9 is a good, below $8 is an excellent entry point. I'm expecting this to be between $10-12 before June. Meanwhile I'm buying shares and selling CSP @ 7.5"

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"$8 even, with 5x 12/17 7.5 calls (finally down about 20% as of Friday)"

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs a solid cost. You could average down a bit. I think you are near floor barring terrible earnings etc.

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôd lol so hard if GS bought puts on those companies before margin calling their clients and killing the price before the weekend for a quick pile of cash.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Didn't they recently publish ""research"" that the market still has more upside?"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Is it the GUH we've all been waiting for?

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Goldman still screwing over their clients. Nothing has changed since 2008 lol
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,The real question is who did they tell to buy shorts the night before they did this.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,They're probably going to put it all on the GME rocket before it takes off
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,What does this mean? Sorry...smooth brained
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Whatever they are doing, you can bet it's because they are currently screwing someone or they are about to screw someone."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Getting liquid for the imminent payout???
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I didnt know that individual Pokemon went public. What's the ticket for my boy Squirtle?
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,This is not related to GME.  This is not GS getting ready for a crash or trying to scare people out of the market.  This is some over leveraged hedge funds that were spin offs of Tiger getting hit with 10b worth of margin calls.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,FUCKING PAY ME!
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,DUMP IET
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,GUH
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Loading up the cash for war or getting out before a crash. Probably a fake crash to shake the retards (like me) out of the market. That ship stuck in the canal smells fishy.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"If I would‚Äôve known, I would‚Äôve place some puts on these and make some decent amount out of em."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Here‚Äôs the answer to that thread on the front. Wonder why they liquidated. That‚Äôs a buttload.

Edit: wait maybe they liquidated because the price crashed so much. I don‚Äôt know."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Is it a good oportunity to grab few $DISCA or should I stick to GME ? Smooth brain here.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,And so it begins...

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I'd be more surprised if they didn't honestly
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"A lot of it is asian stocks. It's more of a ""lets feed this garbage to our clients before the news break out"" type of thing that Goldman pulled (again). Can't wait to see them fined for another $10,000 due to violating their fiduciary responsibility. Oh no, some exec will be able to afford one less Armani suit."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I do believe so
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice!
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Its a beautiful thing when ya see it, KARMA IS A BITCH"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Goldman placed these trades on behalf of an Asian fund that suffered severe liquidity issues and got wiped out.

They were acting as the broker on their behalf and liquidated the position. 

This wasn't Goldman selling stocks on their own."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,True statement ‚òù
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Goldman & Morgan were acting as brokerages for someone else. The sell off was NOT shares that GS & MS held.    

>Wall Street is now collectively speculating on the identity of the mysterious seller or sellers. The liquidation triggered price swings for every stock involved in the high-volume transactions, rattling traders and prompting talk that a hedge fund or family office was in trouble and being forced to sell.    

The rumor so far is it was an Asian fund getting margin called."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Someone bit off more than they could chew... or in ape terms she tried to take the whole banana but gagged it back out (you never go full banana)... or in retard terms he had one too many red colored crayons
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,They are. They took over the assets in margin call and dumped it off-market to their clients.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I guess it doesn‚Äôt go without saying on this sub that not everything that happens in the financial world is related to GME
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,You just killed my boner
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nop, just selling assets acquired in a margin call off-market (to their customers), before the news break out."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, the ship is stuck in the canal"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,There was a DD on shorting DISCA on Thursday.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Could have 25X your money or more
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah like 18,000% Friday - may not be too late, but not nearly the payout...once this report circulates, everyone still holding those stocks are going to sell off I believe."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"1. One of their clients who was trading with them on margin got margin called, had to transfer assets.
2. Goldshits packaged it up in ""blocks"" and offloaded it to their unsuspecting clients.
3. News started spreading of lots of shares being sold off-market, clients who got screwed over started liquidating it on the open market to limit their exposure.
4. The market tanked.
5. SEC is maybe gonna step in, bring down the hammer, and try and collect a fine worth 0.0001% of the value of those trades.
6. Goldshits are laughing on their way to the bank."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,im @ 100% gme SHARES
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Puts on DISCA - that thing‚Äôs tanking at least to pre-COVID value...it was grossly overpriced.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Nope
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nah, Japan is gonna  have to buy back in on April 1st, the markets will boom again then.

Most of the sell off drama has been started because Japan has had to sell a bunch of US bonds, causing interest rates to go up so people started US growth companies and it snowballed, their years ends on 3/31, when they‚Äôll have to start buying again."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"I assure you, their clients will also pay for that fine‚Äîit will never affect executive compensation. If 2008 didn‚Äôt, nothing will"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Reddit karma, on the other hand"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"If the fund sold it, they would have dumped on the open market. The fact that Goldman sold this in block-trades says that they (probably) sold it off-market (although the article doesn't actuate that point). So the asian fund got margin called and had to transfer/give up all their assets and Goldman dumped it to their clients (i.e. other hedge funds, pension funds, rich individual investors) before the news break out. That's the screwing over part."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Finally in terms I can understand!
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes. Screwing people is what they do.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,They are going to run with this story all next week. Blood bath.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah but there's probably fish in the canal too
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah well, in my defense gme posts kinda over take everything. I might‚Äôve missed it"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"The DD was just a coincidence though right? As in, the poster had a reason to believe DISCA was generally overpriced, but didn't anticipate a prop firm getting margin called which contributed to tanking the price."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I just want the value of my puts to go back that what they were before trading was halted. Account went from 10k to 4k in a few moments...
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Still time to get a put in and see
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,They got margin called.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"I understand, believe me. My daily practice is to filter on DD and scroll through skipping AMC and GME. Yes, it's absolutely a lot. You have to look intentionally."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, the DD was coincidence\* to jpm dumping on that exact day.

\* not strictly coincidence, they are very likely not 100% independent events"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah the $30 put on DISCA is only around $1.00, so why not. That thing is tanking to mid-twenties at least, and VIAC just lost half of their worth, so I don‚Äôt see how it‚Äôs not going to continue to tank."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Look, you made $200.  That's a McTendie sandwich for you, small fry  for the wife and a box of magnums for wife's boyfriend.  

You're doing well bro."

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Even without the infrastructure deal the cost of Steel is more than doubled since last year and is incredibly in short supply by all manufacturers. Last weeks dip was an incredible time to invest in the sector.

Domestic us companies are fairly well protected from Imports because of the ridiculously high cost of shipping, tariffs and because of the requirement of using American Steel in public works."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sitting on 130 calls of CLF between April, May, and June. Can‚Äôt go tits up."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,CLF has made me good money
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"One other sweet thing about CLF is that just now this week, slowly, the idiot mainstream analysts are starting to wake up to the realization that its not just an ore processing company anymore but both vertical and horizontally integrated since the acquisitions.  
I am up 300% on CLF and this is just only starting.   
Pre GME wsb members know exactly where the true steel DD lives and breaths and so far those early last year predictions are falling in place week by week"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,$MT is the game
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Concrete is a major ingredient and a handful of players. Steel while positive has imports impact IMO. May be steel etf to diversify irrespective of who wins the deal like jets
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"I work in the oil industry and I see a lot of steel fittings from India, Italy, Spain(?), Germany off the top of my head. Chinese is largely not accepted for QC reasons. I don't recall seeing a ton of US made fittings. These tend to be forged/cast products.

I think the rolled stock is normally of Canadian/US manufacture."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"There literally so so fucking many steel producers..I understand you are backing CLF but from the whole DD I honestly don't see the major upside. 

Seems like it would apply to any steel company no offense."

Depending on how big a clusterfuck it is, you can be in trouble if you are too far ahead and overcommitted. Look at Cal High Speed Rail and note the huge overruns on the engineering and design and construction left to suffer. Also, waivers to Buy America are common. Ship America regulations require transportation on US flagged carriers. This also gets waivers. I would be more inclined to find the ""in favor"" green innovations which will benefit from this infrastructure spending."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Been watching it range from 14-17 the last couple weeks. Just haven't had the money to buy in at the lows.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I like MT more IMO
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I love CLF but one concern is Biden has a guy in his administration that was on $X‚Äôs board I think
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Easy money has already been made on infrastructure talks from past 2 years. It's time to sell the news?
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,So there going to announce this in Pittsburgh and help Cleveland and tell US Steel to fuck off?  You my friend are a true tard.  Cleveland does not have that kind of luck.  I‚Äôm all in on USX.  Poor Cleveland.  Unlucky fools.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Shhhhh you will bring in the herd of apes and then things will get all sorts of manipulated and emotional.  I‚Äôm up 300% myself.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,you should read about the gov acquisition process
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Porque no los dos?
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I bought some $25 CMC calls a few weeks ago that are doing quite nice...I agree with you. It‚Äôs going to be industry-wide.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,You think 04/30 17c gonna be enough time considering the announcement is so soon?
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,You have most definitely already seen the how much fomo liquidity is in this market..... it doesn't even matter anymore. I wouldn't be surprised to see a 10 bagger with my CLF options..... cheers.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Eugene B. Sperling is his name. The contracts will be awarded to all major producers.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,You are correct. US steel will get sole rights to all of the steel required for Americas infrastructure plans lol. The entire industry will bleed up and where do you think X will acquire the iron ore for manufacturing? Perhaps from the single major iron ore mine.........  owned by CLF. I rest my case simple ape. Perhaps you should stay with GME... it fits you better
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Ahh yes because every industry consists of just one player
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"So basically you're both the same person trying to be two different people.

Interdasting...ü§îü§îü§î"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,What options did you purchase? I‚Äôm in.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I see this infrastructure stuff as a buy the rumor sell the news type deal I will purchase more short dated calls on open money but the infrastructure bill will get stalled forever in congress and may not even pass but I think a good run up could come from the announcing of it I hope what do you think?
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I live im duluth mn where the raw ore for cliff comes from look it up...cliffs owns the major mines in minnesota which are the biggest in world!!!!...its not Cleveland......Its  a massive operation nation wide....ill be buying long term call options....all raw commodities are sky rocketing!!
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Exactly.  If you couldn‚Äôt tell I was goofing around you my friend are a true tard.  Either way I‚Äôm buying both because I‚Äôm a tard as well.

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is the confirmation bias I need in my life. Fisker has a presentation this week at the BoA automotive summit. I‚Äôm shorting this stock. If the price jumps after he speaks I‚Äôm doubling down. 

Why do people even listen to this dude? He blamed hurricane Sandy for his company‚Äôs bankruptcy in other interviews. He takes no responsibility for his failures and has learned nothing. He‚Äôs a designer with a big ego. Instead of being humbled by his past experience he thinks he got unlucky or was working with people who didn‚Äôt understand his ‚Äúvision‚Äù. I know the type. And he is not someone who can make a successful company.

Edit: just wanted to expand, this guy had success at BMW because people with industry experience had him on a leash. But as head honcho and the leash gone he doesn‚Äôt understand the tech or business of his own industry. He just knows what sounds or looks cool. He probably loathes the engineers that make his ideas possible. Forcing VL to add an F is just one hint at his arrogance. Just not well suited for heading a car company. Every successful car company is vertically integrated for a reason. Every company that tries to side step that fails sooner or later and if they get a product out it‚Äôs a disaster. The Ocean has been delayed multiple times. The semiconductor chip shortage is going to delay him again, which will most likely be the catalyst for a drop soon. Foxconn is well known for not honoring deals and once they realize how complex car manufacturing is they‚Äôre going to drop this. It was only positive press for their Wisconsin plant anyway. Everything about this company is suspect. I‚Äôm not normally a    üåàüêªBut I couldn‚Äôt ignore this. Especially after my one put last week was my saving grace because all my calls were murdered."

Edit: Good friggin reminder. I just realized I‚Äôm sitting on a bunch of April 16th calls I had totally forgotten about..."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I dont get it? you held the call now you have the position. whats the issue?
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I didn't think brokers would exercise if you didn't have the capital to make the purchase. Hope SPY opens green Monday...
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"This happened to me with Tesla 1500c that expired in the money, gapped up to 1720 monday and sold right away. Hope this happens for you."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Username <TheJacen> i want a papertrade account so i can learn to fuk up a 6 mill profit like OP. ktanxbai
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"What the fuck do you do in this situation? 

Can you just not exercise the calls?"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"What happens if your call goes in the money and you don't have the funds to buy the shares?

Will they lend you the money since you can instantly sell the shares for a profit and pay them back or do you just miss out?"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck that
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,How much does he stand to lose/gain here?
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,how did you not know...lol...  opposite hour went down + we had opex.  It was clear to me they were trying to trigger sales before a run-up.   All the biden stuff and fomc stuff went clear.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,You and OP both most likely
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"guy bought 395 calls expiring on friday, but spy finished above the strike so he got the shares because he didnt' close the option ... and while normally that is what you want, the problem is it buying 100's of shares of SPY costs.. well hundreds of thousands.. 

also SPY trades 24/6 on real platforms by the way..

https://ibb.co/pWfMBjJ


**these all trade 24/6 so you can sell your shares of SPY on sunday at 8pm**



Know this info!!



So he can sell his shares at 8pm tomorrow sunday."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,He‚Äôs getting margin called by 4K on a 6m trade I think is the issue here
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I fuckinv pray it does for this guy
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,What??
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,He was itm since he didn‚Äôt close he just missed out
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,If you have a margin account they will auto buy you in to huge debt like happened to OP
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you don't have enough $$$ to cover the transaction, I would think the broker would buy (exercise) at strike then sell at market, give you the difference & charge a commission for their efforts."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,On 'real' platforms lol/ Literally only TDA offers this and they take on massive risk for doing so.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"But if you don't have enough $$$ to cover the transaction, wouldn't the broker buy at strike then sell at market?"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hence why it‚Äôs called options, you have the option to buy but are not required to"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"He was assigned shares from a call option, so he had to pay for them. Presumably it was otm and went itm after hours. If the share price goes down after he's assigned he loses money."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Technically true.


People would get mad at their brokerage for letting options with intrinsic value expire worthless. Obviously people should manage their trade tho like you suggest."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"you might want to learn more about options friend..

when you buy a call at strike 395, and the market goes to 396, you are ""in the money"" with your ""option to buy"" 

**however, almost all brokerages assign you your shares - auto exercise in the money options on expiration if you still have it open -**


so no, you are ""required to buy with buying calls"" if you leave your options open and don't close them and unless you tell the brokerage to NOT EXERCISE your in the money options, then you are required to buy.."

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Idk why I thought it topped out at 1400 you right lol
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,They exercise if you have the capital to back it otherwise it‚Äôs sold to market.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,It doesnt matter... its about the definition of the product not how brokers handle it.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,additionally like you said you can notify your broker to not exercise it. so by hold and not telling to them not exercise it you are there by giving consent for assignment. I dont know why you dont understand this
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,um yes? he could have called his broker and ask them to not exercise. by not doing that he consented to assignment.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,it wasnt forced. He opted in to buy them whether or not he knew he was doing that or not.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,How did you manage to get nearly 2000 shares and still average 257 each? Given GME‚Äôs wild swings. The ability to cost average that high for that many is either stupidly impressive or impressively stupid.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Either managed to buy all at once on the high end or got unlucky and bought multiple times at the top.

This is the way"

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,YOY? You mean since the absolute bottom when everything shut down? Low bar
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Clickbait title much? Short Squeeze AMD = lols.

I believe that they are currently undervalued at $75-77 and it‚Äôll hit $90 again this year. They just need to get their semi conductor issues out of the way. That will take time.

In the short term, I believe it‚Äôll head back to $80-82 but with how unstable the market has been for growth stocks, might be a good option to do the wheel strategy (sell weekly puts, get assigned, sell weekly covered calls -> if you don‚Äôt get assigned, sell more weekly puts the following week)

*Not financial advice. I am not a financial advisor. Just a fellow crayon eating autist.*"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Short squeeze in the title is a downvote from me

Good luck!"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Short squeeze? AMD shot up because data mining shot up when everything shut down. Not too mention a ton of other hardware developments they have made that drew in more people when gaming shot up. Again, because the lockdown. It wasn't a squeeze."

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,all those diamond nuts stuck in suez just means less liquidity for hedge cucks. The floor just doubled
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs what I took from this.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, so from what I can deduce is that because this demand is about to go up, companies are about to pay a premium to get their materials/supplies over to them. When that happens, a lot of companies will be passing the extra money spent onto the consumer in the form of higher prices. This is going to eventually make its way into the consumer price index.. thus making it look like inflation is coming up. On a short term mentality, we can see a really shit market as a lot of money will be shifting around in fear of this inflation."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes the supply of tankers is already tight and now that the Suez Canal is blocked, they have to reroute around Africa which is a 2 week trip but demand hasn‚Äôt changed. So there is huge demand for tanker miles and there‚Äôs not enough tankers to go around which means ship owners can charge whatever they want.

Back in 1956 when the Suez Canal was blocked and ships had to go around Africa, Tanker owners saw a supercycle as there was so much demand but not enough tankers allowing them to charge whatever price and they all made off like bandits."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hold it literally for ever. Never sell it. Will it to your children. This isn‚Äôt about making money, this is about [insert nonsense Q tin foil hat garbage]"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes. And for the next 25 years we will need a shit ton, especially if we change all our infrastructure to become green, then we need at least two shit tons. But I guess you just buy sth. and hold it for minimum 30 years without selling. In that case, good luck guessing which green energy company will still be alive and successfull until then. For someone who thinks he is thinking long term you are very short-sighted :-p"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dead? probably not. We are a lot more reliant on oil than you would think, but that doesn‚Äôt mean I plan on holding this play till 2050. I am going to be playing the upcoming supercycle in oil tankers tho"

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Im thinking it‚Äôs going to start ripping up this week if the canal doesn‚Äôt get fixed over the weekend. If the canal stays blocked and it seems like it‚Äôll take longer than expected I‚Äôm buying more Monday open

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"When I was part of a fund around 2009-2011, that was one of the discrete risks to this company. Here we go again. If the company declines in market cap it‚Äôs because copper prices dictate so (ie Asia reduces demand). Is the potential decrease in margin bigger than what they can absorb on a volume basis? Back then we got in around $19. After 2011 the fears of China‚Äôs collapsing demand was percolating around hence the stagnation post 2012."

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"The fact that it was a SPAC, probably helped drag it down along with the others"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think it is because they were slated to join the Russell 1k/3k last week. They didn't make the final cut..something something CEO owns like 90+% of the company and there was a mix up of how many shares were public? IDK

So in 30days or so they may be back in the running for the Russell again.

So..its down probably because people are skittesh they didn't make the cut."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Same boat as you I made some $$ on the spike since I was in while everything was worthless I do like the stock because their cash flow P/E ratio but I also dislike the stock for various reasons such as their ceo making the ultimatum with RKT on their first Green Day in months because of RKT‚Äôs momentum from divi 
Uwmc ceo also said he doesn‚Äôt even check the stock price daily and doesn‚Äôt care what it‚Äôs at maybe checks weekly or monthly so don‚Äôt expect him to come rescue you like RKT a lot of people like the divi given by uwmc but it‚Äôs weak and would take 3 years to reach rkt‚Äôs one time divi 

Upside to uwmc is they do get included into russel at later date and this is a great dip for that occasion or that their next earnings is a surprise stunner and they shoot back up to double digits sub $8 is a great starting point"

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Exactly what is this boring long time hodler shit
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"The reason they werent included wasnt so much the amount of shares available, it was the fact they just IPO'd from being a SPAC.  Russel treats SPAC conversion into IPO's differently.  Because of this, there is a 180 day waiting period for them to be included into the Russel list.  They should be included in June, because the 180 day period will be over with.

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Great DD. Keystone xl has been cancelled... as oil prices rise and alberta oil becomes competitive again cp is going to have a money printer moving this crap to texas. As such this is a long term play that still needs aproval. As for anything that happens with an increase in mexican traffic, that will likely be a bonus, but the time frame for that could be anywhere from 2 to 30 years, hence why I call it a bonus. As for environmental arguments... well canada isn't going to block any oilsands work if the market demands it. They are just going to block pipeline development as that's politically difficult to get broad enough agreement to ever get anything done... which means more on rails... when the demand is there to pay for it. That aspect is a 1-8 year play in my view."

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"mexico native and resident here!

whatever you think of the mexican gov is probably wrong. Our goverment is easily the worst in the region and every fucking day they come up with some bullshit to undermind both global and regional business.

From trying to block the operation of foreign-funded power plants (as to return to a gov controlled monopoly) to daily accusations of mischieve and fraud from the fucking useless president (Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador) to anyone or anything under the sun.

Doing business in Mexico is quite risky right now. I would advice to review your info with a focus on how can Mexico fuck this shit up because we will.

If you think Trump was a POS, Lopez is quite the rival but he's also uber useless for Mexico's growth. Trump might have been and idiot, ignorant, swapy rat but at least he allowed the USA to keep on doing business, that won't happen in Mexico.

Also $KSU continously gets the rail road block by some fucking idiots demanding social change. At times, their trains will be completely stoped by a month or so and once the mid term elections in June go down, if the political party of the current president wins the Michoacan state it will only get absolutely fucking worst.

Again, Mexican ape over here, i've seen it with my own eyes, i wouldn't trust this goverment to do anything to change our precarious conditions, if anything they'll just make it worse.

Thought about sharing at 420 in my IRA and 69 in my individual at one point, but I'm not interested in owning fewer than 100 shares of anything I invest in, ever.

Plus I'm quite aggressively bullish on this stock. Anything sub-$200 seems like a really good deal to me, and all of these discounts that keep happening are too enticing for me to pass up."

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"I try and wait until Thursdays or Fridays, since the way I'm managing this is actually asssisted / boosted by the hedgies suppressing the price. 

Rolling options for premium translates to ""free"" or ""house"" shares without infusing more cash externally. Basically buying shares with theta money.

But when the price does crazy things and the stock falls out of the ideal range for my strategy, I often get impatient and just buy more midweek (with a new cash infusion)."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Assuming you mean account value? Yes, it is up pretty significantly.

But the goal is shares, not simply account value. Any ""profits"" to be taken will be done via options (and even then, that money is to go back into buying more shares anyway), so I have literally zero reason to offload my shares.

Even during the squeeze, whenever it occurs, I have zero intention of selling all of my shares."

Just gotta make up your own mind about stuff and stick to your guns, I guess.

Never too late to FOMO, they say. Just, maybe if you're trying to actually profit off of this stock, don't blow your whole wad (always good to have a bazooka of cash ready to average down when your faves go on fire sale).

Not investment advice, of course. Far be it from me to convince anyone to buy this thing (would be better for my personal plans  if the price weren't driven up so consistently).

I just really like this stock."

Tesla has also become well known. When people think of electric cars, they think of Tesla, the same way that when people think of tissues, they think of Kleenex.

Their self-driving technology is the best there is right now, and that will be important in the future. Right now, their latest self-driving beta works pretty well. The driver still has to pay attention and be ready to take over, but seeing how fast they‚Äôve made progress with it, it‚Äôll probably be pretty much perfect in a few years."

The ride is awful, and my head hits the ceiling in the rear. Very uncomfortable.

They don't make actual real money. 100% creative accounting.

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Once the GME train is over I hope we let Gamestop die already. They never deserved to get this spotlight. They always were a shitty company that abused their power to sell overprized shit

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"I know I‚Äôm coming late to game here and this comment probably be akin to shouting in the wind, but I‚Äôd me remiss if I did not mention the charity: Child‚Äôs Play https://childsplaycharity.org 

It was started by the guys behind the Penny Arcade web comic in response to some dumbass (forgot his name) that said all gamers are killers in waiting and will never amount to anything good. So to prove the dipshit wrong they setup this charity which is now connected the children‚Äôs hospitals all over. 

The hospitals have amazon wish lists that people can then buy the items and have the shipped directly to the hospital or hospitals of their choice. 

So if you feel like donating games and gaming devices please give this charity a look. 

Thank you."

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,This is awesome. Children‚Äôs Hospitals are such a great place to donate to. Those toys will get directly passed on to a kid having a hard time. My son has a chronic illness and is in the hospital often. These gifts make such a big difference in morale. When my son is about to get chemo and a nurse busts out a box of legos or some other toy he is totally distracted from the treatment. I‚Äôve tried bringing toys and stuff myself but somehow it‚Äôs just not the same if I‚Äôm giving it to him.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bro, you are a good person and should be very proud of yourself.

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Man, I wish I could do something like this. Think since I paid off my other car I should stash some of that money away that I‚Äôm not wasting and buy a switch or two for kids who have it so much worse than I."

Giving someone a switch without BOTW is like getting an N64 in the 90s without Super Mario 64... [or like getting an N64 without one of these](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51XKYQNVY9L._AC_SS450_.jpg)."

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,The great thing about all these is that the money is going back into GameStop.. ape circle of life
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is the karma I'm here for.

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"You are so kind!  My brother with brain cancer goes there for treatment, he is there this weekend, the switches are great since they are portable."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Atta boy! Cant wait for it to hit 1,000 so I can do the same"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,This group is the best!!! üëèüèºüëèüèºüëèüèº
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Damn man bought the best games too
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,This has been my favorite aspect of the whole GameStop drive.  Love how people are supporting the store (more than just the stock) and also being charitable with the gains.  Pay it forward people.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Uplifting news of the day ü•∞
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Save the receipts and when the squeeze be squose you can use the donation agenst your taxes
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Big props. People can slam wsb all they want but the retards here are helping the world way more than what they get credit for
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,So he sold?
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is all I want to do to, help other people have better lives with my stonks"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Good man
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I like the stock
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Power to the people!! Literally!!
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"hey its me, ur childrins hompspital"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ronald McDonald house is a great place to donate. A lot of those kids won't get to leave on their own terms (its sad, I know) and would love something along those lines. 

My younger brother was at one for almost 2 years and they went above and beyond, but the kids love the donations from random strangers."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,You're the MVP
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"So you are supporting GameStop and helping children? Freaking amazing, love this community!"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, I let my kid have my switch last year (we were like flaaat broke) for Christmas, I got my fiance and her like $200 of stuff combined, and got her Animal Crossing. Ngl the only reason I haven't gotten her a new switch yet is because she's dumped several hundred hours into her animal crossing village."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Stonk yes
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I hope to make enough money to do something like this from GME. I've always thought that if I come into a large amount of money the first thing I'll do is for someone else.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,That's great
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,You guys are awesome
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Legend.  Your awesome

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,local news: ape steals a number of switch consoles from seattle children's hospital!
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Love it, my fellow autist. This is the biggest and best community out there."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"That‚Äôs the big difference with the everyday people who gets money.  They share it with community.  Not buy super yatch, hide money offshore and continue to step on necks on people who work for them.

After this squeeze happens we will see an outpouring of charity to the community.  This is just the tip of the iceberg in giving"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Diamond hands in the Emerald City!!
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,You‚Äôre the man.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,This is definitely the way.

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Awesome stuff!
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Volkswagen gang
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I hope GameStop see's posts like these and others. Apes want GameStop to be a massive success. Apes want sick kids to have Nintendo switches and plushies
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I didn‚Äôt make huge but turn 200 to 570 and donate to a classmate funeral arrangements. All gives are meant to share remember that my fellow apes.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well done! This sub is so wholesome! Screw the loss porn, I want the charity porn!"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Wall Street Hedge Funds would never
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,The next person should also include free bananas along with their donation for the future fellow apes!
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Dude q1 earnings is gonna be lit from all these plus Mr.Beast literally buying everything in the store
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Just look at the philanthropy when average people have a little extra cash.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Yay for Seattle Childrens!!
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I fucking love seeing this shit.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I wish I bought GME low to make profits and do stuff like this. One day!

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Hey at least those dumb ass bag holders have a purpose.

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I worked on the next expansion that hospital is doing. As I was so happy to be able to contribute in the little way I was able to. Thanks for doing this
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice one!!
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Good man!  I love seeing stuff like this!!!
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,This .... is DEFINITELY the way
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"This shit makes me so happy. As someone who's not doing great financially, I have major fomo when I see posts about people making 6 figures or more on GME, but posts like this one and the donations to various foundations soothe my soul. You guys fuckin rule and I hope you all continue to game the system. ‚úä"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,That's dope man! üòé
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"My daughter had to spend time at Seattle Children‚Äôs. Amazing doctors, nurses, and staff! Awesome job paying it forward!"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,The sad thing is that it took a stock ticker cargo cult to get some of y'all to act human.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Switch is such an amazing console, sure the kids will love it"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Childrens here in CO have little to no game alternatives for the kiddos. If my 4 shares hit. IT'S OVER!!! I can't wait to deliver once. I will buy out every switch in the area and give them! Don't even care about the cost cause our tendies will be enough!. Blessing to all and see you on the stars! =)
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I hate what GME did to WSB but love your guys kindness and give back attitude.  Well done
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Golf R or GTi?

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,f yea!! you all are inspiring !
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"I wanted to donate too, but my local children's hospital said they aren't taking donations because of the pandemic at this time."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,You could have went to bestbuy and got them all at once and saved some gas.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way.

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"First, awesome stuff you're doing!! This is what it's all about! One thing to keep in mind before buying items to donate to hospitals is to first ask them if the items you're donating will be accepted. I have seen certain items unexpectedly not being accepted for one reason or another."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,AMAZING
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"How do we know these aren't just staged photos for karma? A picture with switch boxes taken at a hospital is all I see. Sorry, but this karma whoring world has me cynical."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"All this is telling me is that we should now be buying stock in Nintendo, you crazy fuckers are driving the market, THE RIGHT WAY."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,You are a honorable ape
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck yea that's awesome! Reapect!

I can't see how this behavior is sustainable. 
And I'm not saying we're not doing a good thing, I believe we are, but are we still going to be going to Gamestop just for the cause in a year. 
That's not natural behavior. It's forced behavior and we know humans love the path of least resistance. 
Please make it make sense to me. 
I can keep buying my wifes boyfriend all these toys."

They offered a lot of stuff for me when I came out of my surgery. I was never interested in going to the room with video games, because pain, but a lady with a ton of art books and supplies on a cart rolled through. Nice place to be.

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Hey dude as a counselor for kids myself who has a best friend working as a doctor at Seattle Children‚Äôs Hospital I just want to say thank you for hooking up the kids.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"I feel like every time we start one of these trends we get buttblasted back to the start.

How many billboards were still up as GameStop was drilling to sub $40?

How many animals adopted before we tanked again?

I swear if and when the squeeze happens I‚Äôll walk into St Judes with a comically huge check but not until those tendies are finally secured."

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Thats dope. I remember when I was a kid and my older brother was in the hospital with diabetes. I cried to go to the hospital because he was able to play video games lol.

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"How does this post have 93% positive likes?
It should be 100% positive likes.

Good for you fellow ape. I‚Äôm proud to be apart of a great community that knows how to give and pass on happiness. Unlike fucks that don‚Äôt have hearts. 

Also as a side note. If your boss tells you to downvote and you say something like this. Use your fucking head. Sure downvote something that says ‚Äúif he‚Äôs still in I‚Äôm still in‚Äù or ‚ÄúMOONING TIME‚Äù but guy is literally giving to children that are sick. Don‚Äôt downvote that. Morons."

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,We should designer some wsb stickers
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Someone please buy me one too ! Would love to play BOTW and what not
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Finally someone is getting actual GAMES to go with these switches. Switches are nice but each game is stupidly expensive.. I wonder how many kids got a free switch only for their family to not be able to afford games.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Legit made me cry
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Why would you take the picture in your car in the parking lot and not actually when you go to donate them?
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Give to me. Cancer children get none.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I fucking love all you retards. You have made my life more enjoyable by just being a part of this. Stay strong.

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thank you.

When I was a kid, I was in the hospital over and over and over due to multiple required surguries on my legs, and being able to escape into Super Mario World for hours at a time, or Megaman X,

***was absolutely instrumental***

For my mental health.

You are a fucking saint."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Hedge Cucks would never do anything remotely close to this whenever they gained from shorting companies. This is why as ape as this has been I like the stock

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,This is great man! Check my idea in my recent post. Would be great to have it!
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I hate when people online say don‚Äôt post stuff like this - it‚Äôs great inspiration and more people should be bragging about their good deeds rather than all the cool stuff they bought selfishly or their lifestyle. This is way more worth it

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"I really wish nintendo would properly address the stick drift issue... With the amount of use these things are going to be seeing, there's gonna be a lot of literally unusable switches sitting in hospital storage or in a landfill in a year or so. The fact that you can't remove the controllers on the switch lite really makes this problem so much worse and it's really in acceptable that nintendo is still shipping units that have these problems.

That said, good on you OP!"

But it's Gamestop."

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Instead of all these APE's donating to Children's Hospitals (which ya it's great and all) perhaps we should take up helping those that are less fortunate then us.

Hospitals have donors and big companies that give to THEM.

Homeless people have NOBODY!  They are looked down upon in society and made to think less of themselves.   Because hey go get a job ya bum!   

But wait being poor and homeless is NOT at all about them being lazy or drug addicts.   There are actual circumstances which has attributed to their homelessness.   Just like as we see with COVID and how it has displaced lots of people.

Why not take the money and help people that are living on the street.

Imagine the difference that you could actually make!   After All you might have just spent enough to keep someone in their apartment / home."

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,WSB users are betting for GME to give to children hospitals. [Michael Jordan](https://imgur.com/gallery/NL3UOFd) is betting against GME and losing millions.

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I think smash is the game that gave my joycons the drift o.o
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,It's gonna get to the point where there's going to be a switch for every child.  Gonna be a bright future.

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,a donation can be considered a write off (i think up to x amount?) but check your state laws

I was really sick as a kid and had several long stays in the hospital, and I don't think my mom would have made it through all of that with her sanity in-check if those weren't around. Living in a hospital room 24/7 with her very sick child, in a ward with other very sick kids, most of which didn't make it, with no escape would have likely broke her. But with the Ronald McDonald houses, she was at least able to get away and get a decent night's sleep, talk to other people whose kids weren't also on the brink of death, and just take a good shower on occasion. 

Plus we were both able to stay at one here and there as well when I was well enough to not be under constant observation, but still needed to be close for the daily check-ups and things, which was really nice compared to being stuck in a hospital bed the whole time."

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,This year thanks to covid laws even if you take the standard deduction you can still write off 300$ of charitable contributions.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"I believe it is up to $300 for a deduction and takes money off of what you owe, anything more you will have to Probably have it itemized with proof, receipts etc"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Isn‚Äôt this only if you donate to certain organizations? Hospital may or may not qualify it‚Äôs something like a 501c or something like that.

After those two weeks he surprised me with my own N64"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,They did the same with the original Nintendo's back when I was in and out of hospitals. Having that was such a nice distraction to take my mind off the constant boredom or dreadful procedures that were about to come my way.

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"That explains it, I always wondered why they donated to get around taxes"

My roommate for the stay was a boy about my age who was getting fitted for two prosthetic limbs I believe and we had a brand new super nintendo wheeled into our room.

I don't remember much else besides the fact that even with just his arms (no hands at the end) he completely mopped the floor with me for like three days straight on Looney Tunes B-ball. He was a terror on that game, and probably would have mopped me up even harder with his new hands.

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"In fairness to them, it *can* get pretty wonky on the specific paycheck you work overtime on. Sure it shouldn't be *less* than your standard paycheck, but it also won't be much more either.

When you work overtime, your taxes are witheld at a rate that assumes that how much you got paid this pay period is how much you will be paid every pay period, which may be dramatically more than your actual tax rate.

It is possible that you won't see the majority of your overtime pay untill your next tax refund. Which sucks."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,It's just poor education plus an unnecessarily complicated tax system.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"I did that for 2 months. 4 pay periods. My taxes we're fucked hard on those paychecks.

But in the end I still made less in the tax brackets so I got a nice refund.

Which is why it's a good practice to work OT at the end of the year, not the beginning, so the government only has your extra tax money for a couple months."

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Only on the portion of your income that falls into them, obviously. But, if you can get your income under a certain amount here (using writeoffs, rrsp contributions, etc), then those dollars that you've had credited against your income won't fall under that higher tax bracket, and you can get them taxed under the lower bracket, rather having to pay up more against them. Something along those lines. Basically, use deductions/writeoffs/etc to pay a lower tax bracket, on the income that normally falls under the higher one, and save a fuckload of money on all of that higher income.

Source: accountant friend"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, what you're missing is that by using deductions and RRSP contributions to get your highest income into the lower bracket, you're paying less tax on that income that falls into the higher bracket. 

If I'm $2000 into the high tax bracket, write off $2500 against my income, I'm no longer being taxed a full 25% against that $2000 because for all purposes my income no longer exceeds that point. Sure, I didn't get $2000 back, but if I spend that $2500 and don't write it off, I still have to pay 25% on $2000 instead of, say, 20%, which is a hundred bucks I'm not losing.

You can do this here in Canada not just by buying shit and writing it off, but by putting money in your tax free savings account or RRSP, meaning you keep the money AND pay less tax on it, then pay a smaller tax when you withdraw it later


I'm not an accountant but my friend who is one explained this to me a while ago to show me how much i should be contributing to my RRSP etc and I'm doing my best to regurgitate it off memory, so some details may not be accurate. I also do not know what the USA equivalent is."

More likely to find our selves at 13-14 next week than we are 7-8.  Good risk reward.  I do want to stress though that BB is not a this qtr or next qtr play.  Their cyber sec biz may have picked up or it may continue to lag for a while.  There's nothing about this quarter that makes me think this is THE quarter we see a crazy breakout due to outperformance.  that will happen one quarter soon though.  In any event, doesn't dampen my enthusiasm at all.  And I am ALL fucking IN. If the stock tanks, I will find/make more money to buy more.  Currently have 64,000 shares and 500 leaps + 500 shorter term calls.  üíé‚úãüçÄüçÄüêùüêùüôèüöÄüëä"

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Robinhood is scamming people for pennies at a time which can be related to an extremely high tax(think 3-4 cents each way on both the buy and sell which is an absurd amount of money they are stealing from their clients).

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Good mod.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah I ran into the same thing transferring my shares out of RH. I guess it‚Äôs a a rule for the company that transfer stocks between brokerages. I think Fidelity told me it was the ASCC or something? I have 0.83 shares left of GME parked there for now. I‚Äôll sell that and withdraw it at some point and add it to my buying leverage for more shares through fidelity when I see a nice discount. Looking forward to completely getting the app off my phone.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the scam from office space.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,That's one of the reasons you get free everything and instant deposits on RH. You also can get clipped on options bid-ask as well.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Those fuckers...
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"I get it. I think 99% of the time traders are able to do what they want through RH very conveniently. But for the 1% of the time in cases like GME, AMC, ect, they have proven they are physically incapable of delivering. That along with several other shady things I keep finding out about them does not instill trust in me to the point of taking by business elsewhere. Even if that means having to deal with an interface that‚Äôs sub par for the day and age we live in. That‚Äôs just my perspective though. You do you boo."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the tip. Can I link my brokerage accounts and view my positions with it?
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"To be fair, E*TRADE is free"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I‚Äôm having good luck with fidelity. Although their interface is a little bulky, the time it takes to deposit money into my account and ready to invest is comparable to RH IMO. It‚Äôs also free and supports fractional shares. 

Fidelity has a newer app called Spire that I‚Äôve tried. On the surface it appears to be a much more modern design, but have found it difficult to navigate. Hoping they can spend a little more time on it to make it more user friendly."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah I‚Äôve found that the only time I don‚Äôt get outbid even if mine is the first bid is when I‚Äôm catching a falling knife and hedgies apparently won‚Äôt touch that sort of play via options.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, I think so, although I haven't actually done it yet, I'm using the free tier for now."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,And how is the order filling? The quality of your trade tools ? Information that you receive ?
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Huh? Options can swing in price too, but I'm not sure what you mean exactly."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"So keep in mind I don‚Äôt have much of an idea of what I‚Äôm talking about. My trading knowledge is basically buy low sell hi and I‚Äôm not even good at doing that. But E*TRADE seems pretty good. Whenever I buy stocks it goes through immediately, but the pricing is delayed 15 minutes so I don‚Äôt know exactly what I‚Äôm buying at. The tools on the basic app appear to be only basic charts, the daily high low, and I think P/E is there. From what I understand Power E*TRADE is the actual analysis tool and I don‚Äôt have that installed.

Edit: the biggest pro in my mind is absolutely no fees on trades"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôve noticed corporations don‚Äôt like to buy options while the price is falling rapidly. It makes it easier to buy options when 4x the bids don‚Äôt have to get filled before yours will. It‚Äôs really upsetting when you place an order only to watch your bid get swamped by 50-200 orders before your arca or gem bid gets filled. The lady at schwab called me crazy for asking if they do payment for order flow and said they don‚Äôt do conspiracy bs. The other day I found out they actually do payment for order flow and I feel like I was lied to in an extreme way. Watch market flow orders on a desktop brokerage platform and you will see what I mean.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Alright seems fair. But than you don‚Äôt have something to compare it with or the experience what you need. That makes it difficult to say what‚Äôs good and what not
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm too retarded to fuck with options. I avoid them just like I avoid my wife‚Äôs bf.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Of course not. It's not just big, bad funds doing it either. If I sell call options at 5.00 I absolutely want to buy them back at the lowest possible amount. As the call writer, if I am watching the underlying take a nose dive, I'm going to ignore asks (which is what I would buy it at) on the way down to achieve the best possible price.    

Let me try and put it another way, still using calls as an example. If I sell 20 calls for $DLDO at a $2 premium (this ticker tracks the spot price for dildo futures btw), and you buy ten and the other ten go to whomever, I now have 20 contracts out in the wild I'll either make money on or lose my ass on. Anyway, the price of $DLDO is on a huge down trend, not enough to circuit break but it's plummeting, and I am just giddy because my contracts are earning me profit. Now you, the contract holder is like well this sucks and I want out of my losing position. So you attempt to sell your $2 calls at a loss for $0.50. That sucks, but the price of $DLDO is still going down and the other 10 contracts I sold are now showing up at a price of $0.25 (btw I don't get to choose which contracts I buy back, it's simply closing the position). Guess which ones I am going to buy back first? The cheaper ones. This forces you to either adjust your sell price or hold the position in the hopes of the underlying going up.    

It's not fuckery like you think it is, a downturn on the underlying can cause options to lose a lot of value and fast. This isn't a brokerage thing, this is more of an options thing."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"That‚Äôs fair, before E*TRADE I was using acorns so I didn‚Äôt pay much attention, I just enjoyed the steady rate of return.I‚Äôd love to hear what some more experiences traders think about E*TRADE"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don‚Äôt sell out of positions unless the position is considered a tradeable position, and I have a consistent track record of selling options at highs and buying at lows.        

You clearly have never used market depth for trading options activity and watching for price movement below the initial bid. I would implore you to check it out because you‚Äôre trying to talk to me as if I‚Äôm using robinhood‚Äôs crappy t2 instead of a better one like schwab which gives me the depth of the bids and asks. It‚Äôs not my first week trading options. Whenever I place the bid, sometimes orders will get filled, but mine always tends to be last whenever I trade through robinhood and watch the market depth on schwab, but schwab still has issues letting other bidders get priority on market depth/fill order(if I placed my bid first, how are other orders at same price getting filled before mine if it is supposed to be first in first out?).."

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, this last week of trading has been...unusual.  Nothing was based on business activities or even news.  It was just huge drops of stocks all together.  It was super weird, but I didn't know who was selling it all off.  This makes sense though.  You get your ass in trouble, and well, you gotta sell, hard, to cover your ass.  The only saving grace was the sales were at stock highs, so the sales were well valued.  Unfortunately for everyone else, bye bye thousands of dollars in pretty much an instant for no greater reason than someone fucked up.  

I do like the sales though.  Too bad I already had a bunch of money in them before they dropped.  Oh well, can't lose money if you don't sell, and sales are great times to just buy more, good timing too since I'm selling off some other stuff and spreading the wealth around a little and given those great buying prices some love."

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"When a person or fund gets a ‚Äúmargin‚Äù call they must sell THREE times the amount owed, the reason is that at 30%-35% equity only 1/3 of East dollar is theirs and the other 2/3 borrowed, sell $100 you reduce the margin call by $30-$35.  If they had a $30b call it means their equity is at/under $9-$10b and if it‚Äôs a ‚Äúfed‚Äù call it‚Äôs worse and the margin dept. at GS just sells whatever THEY choose to protect GS from risk."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Most are Asian stocks. It‚Äôs because of tension between China and the West. Also does the SEC wants to delist Chinese companies.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"damn and here's a simple ape that thought is only DISCA, bought only them at 37, lets hope it doesn't drop to 20s ..."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Ok so serious question. I want to buy some options for like around 20k. Anybody smarter than me that has some advice? It seems like Viacom and discovery dropped unreasonably much so maybe worth buying options for those?
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Discovery‚Äôs Ape Week coming soon.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Is this Lehman brothers all over again? Start of the 2021 market crash?
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Great DD, OP, this is gold"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"What propelled Viacom to double its share price since COVID, is it actually a value buy at pre COVID price?"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"There was a squeeze with DISCA. The others, I cannot confirm. Seems like very good opportunity"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I haven't done a deep-dive yet but these don't look like buys to me. The run-up in the price of DISC and VIAC since December borders on absurd and lends me to agree with the overvalued assessment. My hunch is they'll putter around the range they're at for a while like TSLA has been.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is kind of post is what I joined this sub for. And not see how somebody who calls themselves ordinary joe, dumps 40 million in gamestop"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Imagine what will happen when citadel blows up
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,So if they are liquid ate ting for dry powder when is our stonks going up
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Will these companies bounce back to their previous price on Monday?
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,This is Monday‚Äôs play for sure.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not looking good for $VIAC even after liquidation, red flags may cause this to dip into the $30s - is that a buy?"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,So when GME moons and multiple hedge funds get margin called we‚Äôre gonna have a chance to make even more money with all these discounts? Nice.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"In my ignorant opinion IQ is the one to buy immediately, it went to its lower since 12/2021 in a single day."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks for sharing. I think I'll have champagne tonight.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"""The day's volatility is consistent with the level of uncertainty about whether U.S. investors might have no longer be able to buy shares of these and other Chinese stocks on the NYSE or Nasdaq.""

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Question: Weren‚Äôt these large blocks liquidated via Dark Pool block sales?

I thought those were supposed to bypass the order book to stop the orders from swallowing up the entire bid side then collapsing the book."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm at work so not looking at everything, but from my glance looks like they sold all these companies at peak. Obviously the sell off affected that, but I doubt they bought at the top. VIACs growth has been in the last 3 months and it seems kinda sus to me, I'm staying out of these, but I don't have the money to throw in willy nilly, ymmv."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"So due to this, amc and gme should increase by 300%"

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Every stock they liquidated then liquidated others in a tumble weed. Caught up in it across the board. I‚Äôm hedged w GME AMC & spy puts

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Man if a shitstorm isn't brewing... between the Suez canal, China tensions and the bonds shit + then add in the GME madness and we might be headed for a fucking BIG dip. Not to mention that every stock that drops is more margin being used up a shitadel..."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Viac is now an excellent opportunity and that sell off was insane. Company has great shape, deep content licenses, positioning a major player in global content and streaming, they are a value play in streaming, and you get dividends. 

The dilution was a mere 5% of the market cap at the time, they raised 3 billion in cash at exactly the right time and now have secured a ton of money for major content projects without the need for additional debt. 


Very much a great opportunity for leaps or  shares long term."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Do you know if this is what happened with GSX as well?
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Keep your eyes on the prize fk wits, bigger discounts coming soon"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,The real question is why did they feel the need to liquidate in such large blocks vs selling them off in a orderly fashion. Something smells very fishy here but my guess is that this was a warning shot to other hedge funds that if you are over leveraged we'll liquidate your positions at any price.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I was wondering why ViacomCBS and Discovery were on sale. Cool free money.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,So obvious buys ?
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Can't speak for VIAC or DISCA, but most of this has to do with the SEC new rollout to delist Chinese stocks. I wouldn't touch half of these until there is some sort of clarification on which will actually comply with U.S. auditing standards"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Goldman had a 10.5 billion sell off too
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Why were some of these stocks like viacom up over 100% before this?
Viacom is back around late January's price."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,This makes fucking sense. My stocks/options that have high institutional holdings have been fucking tanking. whatever I just double down. cause fuck those guys.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,How many of these are shit stocks and that‚Äôs why the fund blew up?

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,IQ and Viacom wow! What a drop!
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,VIAC seems like a really good buy at open on monday
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Those VIAC calls expiring Friday are cheap as hell.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,ViaCom was up 600 percent. Rumor had a very high short interest. Who knows?
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Sounds like a tiny glimpse into what is going to be the mother of all deleveraging events once GME moons. Puts on the world!! üöÄüöÄüöÄ
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Sooo buy discovery?
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,When I was Discovery down that much I thought something was up.

Fuck viacom, save discovery. I'm just a tard though."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Please consider who your sources of information are. Discovery was purely a squeeze play and is likely overvalued unless the institutional ownership is higher than she short interest after those block sales, and Chinese companies have been on a bigger speculative bubble than the .com bubble imo. Chinese companies only look good with inflation. Without it they will be worth pennies on the dollar compared to their peak."

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Interestingly there are no SEC Filings for Archegos Captial Mangement. So no 13F reports which are required if you manage over 100m in funds. So are they big enough to have caused this massive liquidation?

But just looking at a 1 year chart tells me they both made  an insanely sharp rise (fuelled by what? Covid??) and now they are approaching where they were before the rally started 6 months ago.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Don't you put that evil on me Ricky Bobby! Don't you put that on us!
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,No. Only a handful of garbage stocks and shitty prop firms are going down
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,that would be disappointing but i think the big banks have covered their own asses already
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah starting to feel like it. GME short squeeze, now this..."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Are you high? Lehman was the fourth largest investment bank in the world with $600 billion in assets when it declared bankruptcy. SPY was down 30% on the year before Lehman collapsed.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Silent GME is the best explanation I heard. There were unsubstantiated rumors of a buyout from Disney or a few others, retails investors piled in."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,DISCA has been my reliable money tree for months. Sad to watch it come crashing back to earth after such a great run.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"VIAC and DISC were squeeze plays, but VIAC's new share offerings basically disintegrated the squeeze."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"I am just an average 19 year old, glad I got in so soon, here are my average 40 million dollar gains."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,When it happens I will be setting some ridiculous limit buys for companies that I have dreamed of owning and putting on my space suit.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Highly unlikely.

As to exactly what they do on Monday - It‚Äôs a flip of the coin. They could sell off or move up, it‚Äôs a 50/50 shot.

I still think there is trouble ahead for DISCA, just because of strange DP activity AH."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Are these gonna keep tanking?
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"$30 might be a buy, but I'm not sure about their long term potential because I don't see their streaming service being able to compete with existing popular streaming services (Netflix, Hulu, Disney). It's going to take SIGNIFICANT investment into streaming for them to compete, and they're already $21 billion in debt. All the while they're losing revenue YOY from decline in cable."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Might be a good put
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Looking at that as well... Watching closely next week and probably looking at some in the low 30s if it dips
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Black Friday sale time?
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I like the stock(s)
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,You don‚Äôt sound ignirant at all
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Iq is the only one of these that doesn't look insanely overpriced relative to their post covid numbers. It has barcoded the last few years and is currently at the bottom. I'm buying calls money morning. Everything else I'm not touching right now
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,You think our IQ will ever hit over 80? Our brains are too smooth for that shit
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Motley Fool (I know, sorry) says the fall was a reaction to SEC possibly delisting IQ https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/03/25/why-iqiyi-stock-plummeted-today/"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Don't link this Motley Fool shitrag bullshit. If it were investors nervous about delisting it would have happened in December and then when the law went into effect two days before, but the steepest drop was when massive blocks of shares were shopped clearly from one seller.

Nobody is actually retarded enough to think that giant China stocks are going to get delisted. If you can't point to actual news going from Thursday night into Friday morning when it tanked, you have no basis to claim this is because of the delisting thing that was more prevalent and out front days before..."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes but it still has some price impact since at least some of the counterparties to the trade would have been willing to buy in at a normal price. Also, some will almost immediately liquidate. So indeed SIGNIFICANTLY less price impact but not no price impact.

If they sold into the market at that size needing immediate cash, the price would fall at least 30%. Otherwise, they would not be willing to make block trades at a 15% discount. (BTW, that's obviously not EXACTLY how it works. The volume weighted average price would be less than 15% but that would practically mean at least a 30% fall in price given the shape of the average stock's order book.)"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dark Pool sales do still have an effect on the price but a much lesser effect than just market selling. But in this case the Dark Pool trades are only the tip of the iceberg. In the case of TME, there were about 50, 100k share+, dark pool blocks totaling 197M shares while the stock had a volume of over 467M."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,No. 69420%
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm retard, why?"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,This is news. Sell off started 3/23...
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"maybe leaps, but shares have more room to fall; its streaming is not competitive against other major services in terms of content and it's cable revenues are declining faster than its streaming revenues are growing; it could take several years for them to turn a profit on streaming and they already have $21 billion of debt. it should return to December/January prices."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets, VIAC is at levels from 2 months ago. Call me when we at pandemic levels of  $14. no where near the bottom.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,GSX started to dump a few days before the others. There's something else going on with that one.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"From what I am reading, these hedge funds were highly leveraged and when bad news caused some of these stocks like $GSX to go down, some funds started getting margin calls creating more selling pressure and then a chain reaction of more hedge funds getting margin called leading to in some cases 50% loses on some of these stocks."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"When the bank wants its money back it takes your shit and sell it in a heartbeat. 

‚ÄúBut, but, if you could only wait a week to get your money I could have gotten a much better price for my stuff‚Äù - HA! Banks don‚Äôt give a shit. Pay up and get fucked!"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,potentially more liquidation next week
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Perhaps an algorithm couldn't count?
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, short it to 20."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Interesting. Any source to find out more on this?
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,pharma stocks are crazy volatile; they get a boost on FDA approval but always dip at any other time
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Ticker?
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Yup that‚Äôs what triggered the chain reaction of margin calls. Stock went down a bit and a heavily leveraged fund had to liquidate assets causing more selling and so on.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol it‚Äôs more like, GH(good half). With all the rumblings today, Monday-Tuesday going to be hella interesting to watch. üçø is ready. 

Calls on $lube, someone at Archegos going to need it."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,They manage more than 100M but are a ‚Äúfamily investment office‚Äù so since they don‚Äôt manage outside funds they can get away without filing 13fs
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well last week most of the companies on this list faced lots of unnatural selling pressure. My expectation is that once the selling has stopped, the market will naturally revalue these companies hopefully making the prices go up."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,not really. pretty sure this whole ‚Äúlong squeeze‚Äù was triggered by some chinese stock sell offs.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes it means GME $500k on Monday. You should phone in and quit your job.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,They were probably selling 3DTE FD calls and got blown the fuck up
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Maybe try again? Could be my browser?

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,if you periodically invest in vixy you can win from any crash..
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I know but I would have thought something like this would happen throughout previous downturns and other times of volatility. Not during these times near highs on relatively narrow trading. Wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if many institutions are drunk on margin chasing gains
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Seems legit

yeah... someone blew up"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Looks like the DISCA 4/16 $25p I FOMO'd into during the decline are going to be basically worthless on Monday. Sigh.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"There was terrible news about Viacom and a major upcoming dilution.

Do some dd. It might bounce, I was trying to decide yesterday but in the end am worried about the future. Others were liquidating it for a reason.

But it's likely still undervalued it ain't going back to $100"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thank you. Only one I wasn‚Äôt able to find was IQ, but I didn‚Äôt look as hard after finding confirmation of the first few. I wonder if this sets off a chain reaction for next week as the negative price action decreases confidence in the sector."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,The chinese companies might fall down because there was news that chinese companies could be delisted from NYSE if they don't comply with the SEC.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hear it from our friend and reliable source:

https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/27/archegos-capital-forced-position-liquidation-contributes-to-viacom-discovery-plunge.html"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,reminds me of the scene in margin call where they liquidate everything.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,where does his post say anything about gme or a squeeze? you know you are allowed to make non gme related posts in this sub right?
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah some of these selloffs were also a result of the new SEC regulations for foreign companies.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Do you know the name of that firm?
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well... not to sound q... cause I don't like conspiracy theories and stuff like that... but if you look at the charts of VIAC, DISC, and GSX, they all have the ""spike"" that GME has. So there is a correlation there. VIAC and DISC are also some of the most heavily shorted stocks."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I looked at the 5 year history and the highest prices were in the last 3 months, it's a little questionable, looks like it's time to dig."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Decorative gourds that are rotting in the Suez.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think OP said GS margin called them in general, I.e. for a different position, and they sold these positions to cover."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,You gotta Hodl on to what we got

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Straddles.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Straddle options, perhaps? ü§î"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you. That's all I needed to read.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"They are releasing a new streaming service and have 11 million people already signed up for it. Haters point to Disney not making money off streaming yet, but Discovery shows are a lot cheaper to produce and drive higher margins than Disney originals. I think it's a solid buy with a p/e under 20, which seems low for something on the precipice of releasing a new service these days. (Not financial advice)."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,‚ÄúIt used to trade at this for a long time so it still should‚Äù is not exactly a rock solid trading thesis in this clown market
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"I thought it had something to do with the launch of discovery +, their new streaming service which serves up that home and garden segment of cable tv for a few bucks a month."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Short it or buy puts got it
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks! Will be staying from Discovery then. Btw, do you know what lead it to spike last month?"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not to mention, before covid discovery was cutting costs almost everywhere they could for years and years. They were looking a bit like a sinking ship, not sure how much has changed and if covid helped them out (they own streaming services, I believe?) and I'm too lazy to care to look into it more. 








It's a risk, but that being said if you get enough people thinking it's oversold it could bounce back (though probably not to pre-tank numbers). This is typically one of the things I don't have enough confidence in so I don't do it - only to regret it later. Still haven't made up my mind, but I'll probably stay away. If it bounces back, those who buy in can thank me later"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Holy shit is that thing still cock blocking the canal?
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah - I had to look that up. That's  $400M an hour.  It's also more than the GDP of any country other than the US or China.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I feel like it might be slightly related but I think they‚Äôre liquidating due to other reasons like aforementioned margin calls they need to cover or something like that
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh yeah, it did recover the 1.75% it lost earlier in the day

Edit: you right, you right. I was looking at start of day to end of day, not the mid-day dip"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Delist deez nuts. I'm buying.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,If they are going to get delisted it will be in 3 years. They have 3 years to comply with that new law.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,What happens when a stock you own gets delisted?
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I can't I'm stuck in the Suez
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Strong doubt they delist our #1 trade partner.  Otherwise, Disney, Tesla, MCD, etc. will be at risk of retaliation.   It's theater & I'm buying."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"New retard here;

What happens if I buy a stock and then it gets delisted? Does the value of my stock go down to 0? Or is just that the share value plummets?"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,GS sent out a large BWIC for China names but didn‚Äôt trade it. Front runners got pummeled.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Please stop.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,This dumbass got margin called because he had a big position in well known fraud GSX
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"So of every $1 in their acct only .20 was paid for, no clue how that could go wrong lol"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes a day before CLUE was skyrocketing. But it‚Äôs a fact that those China listed companies are a lot times scams. Sometimes it doesn‚Äôt even exist. I think it‚Äôs good that they will get delisted. Should have done way earlier.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"*China, not chinese"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I looked at the graphs for them and you are right. They had a huge increase in a short period so I think there is a risk that the will further drop. 

I will have cash ready if a further drop comes."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,DISCA was first fueled by their new streaming service and later by rumored squeeze potential.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Honestly for us thats not bad.  GME might get a major fire sale before Melvin and frens get margin called because all their other assets are fuk.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I like to picture my jesus wearing a tuxedo tshirt
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I said start of the crash lol it's the small firms that go first.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,What companies you going for?
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Why not sell cash secured puts for those companies instead of limit buys while you wait? If it doesn't happen you collect some premium (although if you're shooting for a REALLY low strike it might not be worth your money)
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I haven‚Äôt gone as far yet but I did liquidate 25% of the portfolio to have as cash for a sell off when the squeeze happens.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hmmm... this sounds like fun. I would love to get Amzn, MSFT, TSLA, GOOG, SHOP and many others but I am going to open it up to the apes.  When the hedgies get margin called what stocks do we pick up  on the sell off.  I call this the post Launch portfolio.  * Given that GME will be +500k/shr of course it makes up 99% of the portfolio, but what do we buy with the other 1%."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"They‚Äôre making a bunch of new Avatar shows, but I suspect those will just fuel a fleet of pirates."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Ig'nant

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,You had me at money morning.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Which date calls you are thinking about buying and at what strike price?

I was thinking 17.5 C, 21 Jan 2022"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"The pandemic prices were an overreaction and that was a newly merged company there was no history to it. 

Nothing is hitting the Covid bottom anytime soon and even industries getting crushed in  Covid are far above pre Covid  valuation, so I don‚Äôt get why that‚Äôs even relevant indicator of what a fair price would be."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I guess so but regardless this is awesome fucking news for us apes. HF's are shittin their pants this weekend.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I feel like HF when liquidating would start with stocks already overvalued
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Bro do you have puts on this you haven‚Äôt sold yet or something? You‚Äôve posted like 10 times in this thread alone disparaging this.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I saw the GS short position in a bloomberg terminal post. The sell off you can read on bloomberg. Was posted around 3h ago

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Wouldn't  them having to liquidate mean that they were long on those positions and possibly short or or overleveraged on a downturn in others?
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,And Easter Bunny pelts
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think they know that, they were just wondering about which positions exactly caused them to be margin called, cause it sure as fuck was not VIAC.

Edit: well I guess it could have been VIAC if their margin call was after it started to tank, but I feel like the much more likely outcome was they were margin called on another stock that had tanked (which there were plenty of in the last month), forcing them to liquidate VIAC and thus causing it to tank as well."

2021-03-27 19:34:06,wallstreetbets,"Anyone looking at making any plays around the stuck ship in the Suez Canal? If I'm understanding the situation correctly, a ship is stuck in the canal and the congestion forces other routes to be used, increasing shipping costs and all kinds of other stuff. The argument for making a play would be whether or not the ship can be freed relatively quickly. 

They have freed the rudder as of last night, but the ship is still stuck, and the president of the company that owns the ship said they expect to have it freed by Saturday night. So it's already taken days, and they are indeed making progress, but there's no guarantee this will go as planned, and if something *does* happen, the disruption could potentially last weeks.

Just wondering if anyone else has been watching and thinking about the situation. Maybe someone has some more insight into this?

From an article a few days ago https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/24/middleeast/suez-canal-container-ship-intl-hnk/index.html:

> Re-floating the massive container vessel is ""technically very complicated"" and could take days, a senior canal pilot at the Suez Canal Authority told CNN.
> The official -- who spoke on condition of anonymity as he's not authorized to speak to the media -- said that the equipment to float a ship is available but it depends on how it is used.
> ""If the method is not correct it might take a week, and if it's done well it might take two days. But if it had been correct [in the first place], then the crisis could have ended yesterday,"" the pilot said.


So i get the impression that this isn't exactly going as well as it should, and it seems like there's a potential play here. Things didn't start out well and call me a cynic but I have a hard time believing leadership when they give such optimistic deadlines, so I'm leaning towards more things going wrong and this potentially disrupting things for weeks. Of course I've got to keep reading up on it and doing more DD, but I was just curious what this community was thinking about this."

So here is my discoveries.

They tried waiting until high tide, then dredging both ends. Didn't work.

They are going wait until next week when there is higher high tide and try refloating.

If that doesn't work, next step is unloading all of the cargo. Unfortunately, it's not a port so unloading the cargo will be very difficult and could take months.

Everyday that one side of the ship is stuck and the other side is still floating, ""micro"" cracks are developing in the hull and run the risk of breaking.

The time lost refueling costs more, especially since crude oil is cheaper in the East.

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,One of the issues is Chinas factories were shut down for about a month for Chinese New Years. They just started back up 4 weeks ago which means the products are just now shipping out. Most companies will start to be low on inventory early May as they expect the boats to start arriving. Now you have this causing at least 1-3 weeks delay not to mention the massive shortage of containers which has been causing 2+ weeks of delay.

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,377 was during the first squeeze ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è There have been multiple
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Agreed.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,but blue crayon tastes so goooood why need other crayon ü¶ç
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh I‚Äôm actually a millennial, I was just referring to my investment style prior to my GME trades üòÇ"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,You are 36 years old.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm not actually one I just traded like one before this
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,unfortunately
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Uh this was all shares
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Going to the moon is just a side perk, the friendships, memories and memes people have made is priceless. Also watching people freak over a small drop is humorous."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I thought his experience cost $115k?
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Damn.  I feel like the last dinosaur, nobody to talk to.  :D

Anyways, good on you.  See you in the lunar gift shop!"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I wish I had bought more at $40 too. I still face palm myself. My first buy was over $300. I‚Äôve been averaging down since.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Never too late to get back in.. no need to yolo, but 1 GME a day keeps the FOMO away"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Good picks, congrats!"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,...? Why didn't you just open an account with a broker that would let you do it and transfer?
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,thanks for saving room on the rocket while i was gone üöÄ üíé üôåüèª
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I don‚Äôt disagree but my profits are already tied up except for my original investment so not much more that I could do
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Oui
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Damn!!  You really know how to stretch $130k!

Congrats on the big score!!"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,You are indeed a smart retard.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Responsibility? What‚Äôs that? üòâ
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"A Tesla, this guuuuuuuy"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have to ask, how did you accomplish this?

Assuming you fall into the 22% short term capital tax gains bracket, you are going to need to set aside approx. $30,000 to pay taxes next year.

That brings you to only a little over $100K left.

Let's say you bring your savings back to $15K where you wanted it to be, that's now $85K left

A low spec'd Tesla will run you close to $50K after taxes, but I'll assume you purchase a pre-owned long range Model 3 so we'll assume that is $40K which would mean you have $45K left. Maybe you just put a down payment on it, lets say $10K but still - in that case you have $75K left but now take on $35K in debt.

That only leaves about $75K to put 20% down on a house. The house would have to be less than $350K.

It's possible and it's a stretch for sure and I'm happy for you dude- how close is my math? ü§£

Edit - then there is the part you set aside money for furniture I didn't factor, to me that could be at least $10K but it depends on the house size and if you have Ikea or Restoration Hardware taste like me lol"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Impressive.  This is the way.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"... you mean ""saved for the tax man march 31"", right?

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,What made you think it was time to sell? Did you sell as soon as Robinhood intervened?
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Sorry I meant short squeeze. No Hedge Funds have bought stock to cover yet.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,35 for now! Haha

and 2 @ 40 in my roth ira that I will hold for the rest of my life as a pleasant reminder of these times"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"You sold well, enjoy!"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Can you please explain :o
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,just a nice down payment on the Tesla and not the whole thing so that it doesn‚Äôt have to stretch too far üòÇ
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,üé∂ wouldn‚Äôt wanna be anybody else üé∂
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Your math is pretty close. I‚Äôm taking advantage of a VA loan so no down payment, but have about ~40k tied up until I close that will then become my ~15k furnishing money and ~20k emergency fund. 15k back into GME. I put 50k away for taxes until I can talk to a professional cause I‚Äôm young and have no idea what it‚Äôs actually gonna run me. Then was gonna put 30k down on the car."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,my due date would be April 15th. I‚Äôve been looking into this and am trying to figure out if it applies to me because I had read something and taken a short little assessment that told me that it didn‚Äôt  ... I‚Äôm very confused to tell you the truth
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,yeah basically as soon as everything started getting fucky and rules were being made up as we went... i was out
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"There are so many funds and individual shorters that I'm sure some have covered and others have opened new shorts. Idk why you think literally no one has covered. I'm not saying it won't squeeze again, but it has definitely had combination gamma/short squeezes a few times."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thaaats the sign of a true ape, [you're holdin sonething more precious than fine ore.... GME - We're HOLDIN YOU](https://youtu.be/_MvSpPM_gvU)"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Coulda shoulda woulda
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you google ‚Äúearnings reports next week‚Äù, youll get a list of corporations that are releasing theirs‚Äô.  

Basically, i think LifeMD is overvalued and their share price will drop when they release their numbers.  

When you buy shares, you own a piece of that company.  The value of it fluctuates but it‚Äôs your‚Äôs to keep or sell as you please.

Options on the other hand is like a casino.  You bet that the price will rise(calls) or fall(puts) by a certain date.

For example, during the pandemic, Tesla skyrocketed so everybody who bought ridiculous calls ended up cashing.

Important note:  im just an amateur so be safe."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Haha!!  Was about to offer you a job managing my money!!
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,what about the taxes?
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"I love reading about what people have done with their GME gains. You're doing the right thing. I've been trading and investing in the stock market for over 20 years, and GME was an anomaly. Keep being smart and realize what happened may never happen again with a stock, and YOLO'ing like you did will typically end up with a massive loss.

Imo, you hit the equivalent of the lottery so enjoy those gains and keep doing the smart thing with that money, congrats! üòÅ"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I should have done the same but dumbass me thought it would make the stock more valuable... so still holding since January
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,on the car or on the capital gains?
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh don‚Äôt worry, I don‚Äôt see myself as some sort of savant or anything. VERY aware that I took a huge risk and got very lucky. Luckily this was just the money outside of my IRA so even if I had lost it I‚Äôd still be on track for my future. Now I‚Äôm on track with a very stable current situation; definitely not taking it for granted.

Thanks for the kind words!"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,on the capital gains yes
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Wish I had saved my award for you!
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,already set aside 50k
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,move to a state that does not have a tax for that
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,i‚Äôm already moving to texas am i in luck üòÇ

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"I use the 65minute because there is 6.5 hours in the trading day - so i'm getting 10 full bars that are distributed equally throughout the day. It's just a quirk, but it's been really effective for me - as has the 8/21 cross."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"the company is kind of garbage, and their product isn't great. NGL. I just like to follow sentiment and buy depressed stocks on a few specific set ups - this one crosses 2 of my 3 boxes, which is enough for me take the trade."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,6.5 hours divided by 10 is 39 minutes... unless I‚Äôm missing something else here?
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmao no you're right on...so he should be using 39 minutes for 10 bars.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you ignore the units 6.5 x10 is 65. But, that‚Äôs not really how math works, lol."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"65minutes represents 10 full candles in a trading day.

It's replacing 10.5 bars with 10 solid bars - to give you an outline on the day overall. It has very little to due with time, and more about getting the entirety of the day outlined in single candles."

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Y‚Äôall crazy
But I like it"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,At least you get $14K from that nice juicy premium

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,So you only make money if it goes over 260$? Or do you even make money when it just goes higher but doesn‚Äòt make the puts worthless

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm having trouble figuring out why doing a way otm cash covered put spread isn't printing free money at this point, with no margin involved. Worst thing that happens if it crashes I sell the lower put I bought, at a premium no less, and possibly get assigned at a price point I'd love."

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,U smooth brain genius. Selling put is bullish.

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Just waiting for the moon mission now.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, sold these bad boys when spot was at 280 or so. Was bullish as fuck and thought hey, this rocket gonna keep going. It didn't and now I'm a proud owner of 200 more shares!"

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,PLTR call will print.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,PLTR needs to fly next week. My calls expire Friday
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm hoping for a wild ride Monday.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Got 13 of the same exact PLTR calls soon we will be moon status
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,4 days RH to webull then when the free stocks settle then webull to I'm not sure.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Stop using robinhood seriously what's it gonna take for you people to realize
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"There's over a billion shares outstanding for palantir, not going to be easy to make the stock jump in a short time"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,nice job ape. I can't wait for Monday.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,PLTR execs have been selling off their shares...
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Why tf u still in RH tho?
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,How exactly does calls and puts work
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,why do you hate money?
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"PLTR is the absolute worst stock ever. Weeks and weeks of you fools waiting for it to ""fly tomorrow"" and it never comes."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,PLTR ain't happening. That's going the other way. You making market donations on those calls. I hope I am wrong as I sit on more shares than I would like of PLTR.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Best of luck man
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,PLTR shares lock ends Monday. I‚Äôm guessing it will go down before it goes up. I‚Äôm long as well and adding next week!
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I use to enjoy my weekends after working all week but now all I do on the weekend is sit around and wish it was monday.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Cathie keep putting money in. Bullish imo
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Hope so as I have been buying shares and LEAPs. Also got in early. If dips again I will make it my largest position. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,The stock is so hyped but continues to do nothing. I've got it in my IRA and plan on holding a very long time until the price finally does something
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Why Monday?
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"For me it was the fear of having my shares frozen for an unknown amount of time.

I started a full transfer at 5pm 3/23 and the shares and cash appeared in my Fidelity account 9am 3/27 - a lot sooner than I thought! Just putting this here in case there are other people like myself who have been hesitant to leave RH for that reason."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is normal and okay. Majority of the shares sold were scheduled months ago. They didn‚Äôt know what the price would be when the shares were sold. They just wanted a paycheck and happens every time a lockup expires. Also, they get lower salaries and high stock based compensation. This means they work harder to make the company grow and get more stock to sell. Their will be significant stock comps from palantir and more selling for years to come. It‚Äôs normal and easier on palantir‚Äôs wallet this way and better for the company as a whole."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs why I got June calls lmaoo
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Money knows what it did.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Pltr is a long play though.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lockup period ended 2/19. Around 2/24, a few execs sold quite the stack."

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"They also have a demo day coming early April, I think the 4th. We get to see the toddler stage of Skynet."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"You're not wrong in the sense that a lot of sites have this cited, but also saw all over Reddit that lock up expired in Feb (like many other comments under here say). Wonder if it happens in waves for various insider types."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm with you 100% lol
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,same for this retarded!
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Cathie is bae
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Aunt Kathy buys $PLTR for a long-term investment not a short-term. She also likes to buy stuff when it's on sale.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Who's Cathie? Lol
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Taking GME gains to all in PLTR
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I agree! everyone is talking about PLTR, but it's only moving $1 or $2. I think PLTR might be a marathon share and maybe it's only going to spike once every 12 months. I'll hold my shares for another 12 months and then might sell off to invest in a more volatile stock."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"I own a hundred shares which I‚Äôm down on, but I‚Äôll hold them for a bit. See how the housing market goes."

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,To make my work day exciting.  Otherwise it just drags on.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Adding on to this: I did a partial transfer of 100% of my GME shares after hours 3/22, they were in my fidelity account pre market 3/24. Just do it guys"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,that sinful slut
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,It is but does June count as a long play now? I guess with the new crowd anything over a week is a long play?
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,That's what people say when the momentum play doesn't pan out. /s
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I can‚Äôt blame founders for wanting money after working for 10 years
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"yeah, it's too bad the casino only opens monday to friday during normal business hours"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,What rock have you been living under? I know her blood type and I haven‚Äôt even invested in an ARK fund.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Cathie Wood, runs the ARK funds. Check her out"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,How is June a long play ffs?

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmao
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,And I thought I was bull on Novavax... Damn. I'd try to break even and buy shares tbh... Might be a long-term play due to these supply shortages.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Fucking guts of steel.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm guessing that money came quick and easy in the first place ?

Fuck me OP. You put my margin position into perspective. Good fucking luck. I hope you're right (for both of us, but I think more for you...)

Fair. I think good opportunity to sell these on or to print by then. Good luck."

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"I believe in this stock. Novavax has successfully completed phase 3 trial with efficiency rate of 96.4 % which is highest among all vaccine producers of covid. 
It has a emergency authorization pending from EU which will be probably announced soon. 
It has a major deal with EU to be signed soon.
All the rumors of Novavax having supply issues are busted with serum institute of India support. I am from India and I know serum institute of India has contacts in govt. They can get the supplies sourced with the help of govt. 
With all these positive news coming...the price will reach upwards of 350$.

2021-03-27 17:28:49,wallstreetbets,"Michael Jordan has NO proven connection to GameStop Ok, you've been played. You didn't even read any articles, you saw a bunch of posts ""fuck Michael Jordan"", you googled around and found your confirmation bias. Michael Jordan personally shorted GME!

TL DR: You didn't check the sources. Well, too bad, because the whole story is fake news. They are just looking for clicks and Gamestop generates clicks. Michael Jordan is a celebrity, like Kim Kardashian. That's enough. Even heard about Beyonce's divorce?

Let's review the facts. Quote from one of the articles:

*""Michael Jordan sold a stake in the Charlotte Hornets in 2019 to Gabe Plotkin and Daniel Sundheim"".* 

That's it for the facts. Plotkin name. Plotkin gave Jordan some money in exchange for a stake in a sports team TWO YEARS AGO. Jordan probably doesn't even remember his face by now. Oh, and Jordan lost some money, no one knows the details because why would they know?

Is it enough to spin a story around it? No. But we'll do it anyway by implying it indirectly and by making speculative bullshit connections and by misleading headlines, like we've done every day with Beyonce's divorce for over a decade now.

&#x200B;

>HEADLINE: *Michael Jordan Is Directly Connected to the GameStop Trading War and Has Been Bleeding Money for the Last Year* 

Text of the article two scrolls lower: *While Michael Jordan himself didn‚Äôt lose any money during the GameStop trade war (that we know of anyway).* 

So you don't know anything. That enough, thank you. Busted.  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 

>HEADLINE: *Michael Jordan net worth: NBA legend down $500M in the last year, and GameStop stock could be part of it.* 

It could be, it could be, OR it could NOT be. Like Shakespeare. Can you prove it? No? Busted.

It seems to be? Can you prove it? No? Busted.

You get the idea. They just copy the clickbait from one another, but they know it is bullshit. Always check the source, question everything, trust no one, be on guard for bluffs, people.  
New shit might come to light, man. But until then, that's just yellow press.

UPD: I am not Michael Jordan."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Me:

*nods in confirmation*"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,This is exactly what Michael Jordan would say
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,[Here's the connection](https://www.gamestop.com/search/?q=Michael+jordan&lang=default)
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"I had this same understanding when I heard this story. There is a connection between Melvin and Jordan,  then there is Jordan loosing a shit ton of money. I think people just assumed Jordan was investing with Melvin and came to the conclusion that he was short GME via investing in Melvin Capital... That's the closest assumption that could have any validity based on what is known. 

I think it is entirely unfair  and wrong to say ""Michale Jordan was shorting GameStop"" as if he himself was. I think the biggest leap that can be made would be that after doing the deal with Plotkin, Jordan decided to invest part of his fund into Melvin Capital, or inversely, he had already had an investment with Melvin Capital, which led to the hornet's deal. Either way, I don't like the hate being thrown at Jordan, I'm not necessarily a fan, I'm a hockey guy tbh, but it's not a to d look for the community, attacking Celebrity's and athletes, based on their investment strategies that we don't know all the deal details on."

I mean c'mon, we've got great DD using...

beta to determine current short interest,
volume and crazy ass math to project future price,
insights from options interest that make no sense,
DTCC statements being misunderstood,
10-K legal disclosures being used as secret messages,
Etc.

OP you're crazy, not them. This thing is obviously still shorted 150+% and enough GME shareholders on WSB will hold out until a share is worth $69,420 with none of them falling victim to the prisoner dilemma because they've cracked the code on human social interaction and cooperation.

P.S. I'm crazy with you, OP. Great post.

P.S.S. for the cultists about to downvote. Just so you know, I'm a fan of the movement and what originally happened, also think DFV is a genius for finding this, also think GME is no longer a bankrupt stock walking and the Cohen story is a good turnaround, also think many who got in will make money from the past squeezes and some future smaller squeezes. BUT also think many of you have no clue what you've gotten into and have unrealistic expectations and will be left holding a bag - an extremely painful one for some and that's the sad part. Some of you will walk away with ""tendies"" and that's awesome. Badass of those who do. Now, if I'm wrong...Well dammit, I missed a rocket n congrats to you all, but I gotta say I feel probability is on my side. (Yes, I give you a chance, I try to never say never.)"

Ok wrinkle brains, I have some actual investment trickery to wet your appetite.

Raytheon  Technologies (RTX) begins liquidating $1.2 billion of OTIS stock from  its Employee 401k plan starting on April 5th and ending approximately 60  days later. The OTIS 401k fund is 99% common stock and 1% cash (cash is  kept in the fund to make payouts/transfers easier). That is currently  \~4% of Otis's Market cap.

Why  would they do this you might ask? OTIS used to be a part of RTX, but was  split off (along with Carrier) in a 2020 deal that made them three  separate companies with three separate stock tickers: RTX, OTIS, and  CARR. Apparently aircraft don't have elevators, who knew?

RTX was perfectly okay being  invested in Otis and Carrier when they belonged to the company.  However, now they are separate companies, and having your employee's  401ks largely invested in two individual stocks unrelated to the company  does not make any sense especially when the rest of the 401k plan is  composed of very broad ETFs.

Ok, so why $65 puts for April 16th if this selloff is going to occur over the course of 60 days?

1. RTX  told all its employees that they had until April 2nd to manually move  their funds into another ETF in their 401k or RTX would start moving  funds out for them and alerting them each time money is moved. My guess  is not many people have moved their money out yet but will do so once  they start receiving emails that their investments are being moved/sold  off each week.
2. The  people actually running the RTX 401k are pretty smart and will move  money out of OTIS at weekly/monthly highs, but employees will just  transfer funds out when they start getting emails regardless of whether  it was a good time to sell or not. This will trigger panic/algo selling  as up to 4% of OTIS (guessing it'll be more like 2-3%) will be sold off  in large chunks throughout the next few weeks, sometimes at the low for  the day. I think this could drive the stock down potentially 10% to \~$60  at its lowest.
3. OTIS happened to be at an ATH on no company specific news so what better time to get monthly puts?

Source:  I have a friend who works at RTX. I assume this is public knowledge  somewhere on some fancy SEC document but I can't read.

EDIT:

Link to actual sources below. 1st link explains the liquidation. 2nd link explains how employees can transfer funds out of OTIS.

Also,  link look at pgs 46-47 in the pdf below (created 09-30-2020, there is a  12/31/2020 one as well if you search). It lists out the amount of $ in  each of the OTIS funds which you'll find match closely with the $1.2  billion I listed above. More importantly look at the note under ""Trading  Restriction"" on those pages and compare them to the restrictions on the  non-OTIS and non-Carrier funds. Employees stopped being able to move  money into those funds over 6 months ago.

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,OTIS is also running into lead time and production constraints due to steel scarcity and price hikes
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,The 70-75 call option spreads look pretty tasty too
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Only fear is the 78 price target and strong buy rating.

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Definitely more risk and more reward for the the 60p (%-wise) but they are pretty cheap. I grabbed a few since they could easily gain extrinsic value.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Appreciate it! The recent move up has been relatively low volume but may continue short term. We'll see!

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"In Germany mostly it's couple of hundred from your parents, couple hundred from side jobs to pay for your living expenses but you can also get student loans from the state to cover your living expenses.

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes but if you market sell you can miss on some of the profits because the price will fluctuate like crazy . If you have a round number of shares you can set a sell limit for all your shares for any amount you want and it will execute at said price

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"It will let you sell if you have more than 10k only if you sell ALL your shares at once. Using a sell limit is only allowed with full shares so if you want to use sell limit to sell more than 10k you need to sell a at once and make sure you have no fractions. 

I think that's what the comment above was saying.

Edit: should be noted that revolut didn't allow buying during the time when robinhood also restricted it."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I am angry at revolut honestly. Stupid discrimination service

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Besides the chip shortage, $F moves like old people fuck. I feel your pain."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Chip shortage is the catalyst for auto industires.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"This week has been an absolute blood bath. The mkt has been brutal to equities overall, particularly with the auto industry bc of the chip shortage. Having rolled out some of my previous June calls to Sep, all of my calls are now back in the red. Liquidated some Jan leaps due to margin call. Also averaged down on dem Jan leaps."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I am still sitting on Ford I bought in 2010 for $12.37!!!! I thought they were going somewhere then.....
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Didn‚Äôt they drop hard because of the convertible bonds they planned on issuing? I think the news came out a week ago

Edit: think ford will overtake Tesla, I know it‚Äôs crazy."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Got in on the $15 1/22s 6 weeks ago at $.57 premium. Only 5 contracts, sold one at $1.76 but wish I sold all then rebought them yesterday! 

Bit of a bumpy ride but I like the prospects so holding for a while. Not FA obviously I just like the stock"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,You're down 17% on your LEAPS for Jan 2022. How does this even remotely qualify as loss porn? Come back when you realize the gains or loss.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have the exact same call. Was pretty optimistic about it at first, but now have stumbled upon many people saying some pretty negative shit that have not helped the optimism lol"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Things must have changed over time. Back over 10 years ago the big 3 were never investments anyone would seriously own

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Exactly
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Exactly.. I‚Äôll let you in on a secret. No one makes money on what everyone already knows.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dear god, I know we are retarded but you really give smooth brains a run for their money. Ford ain‚Äôt taking anybody over. Too much debt and not enough flexibility to pivot to EV‚Äôs quick enough. For fuck sake they have to make the Mach-e in Mexico after all lmfao!"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"To be clear, I don‚Äôt mean buy, I mean overtake like in market cap.

Edit: at least 5 years out, where inflation has taken hold, ford has partnered with either google, apple, or some other company, and Tesla stock has tanked as a result of the correction."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Is Ford building a Gigafactory on 3 different continents at the moment? No. Hell even VW BARELY  mentioned they were going to start planning on building some themselves. So let me ask, what makes you think Ford will will overtake anybody‚Äôs market cap?"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bro, please keep talking. I‚Äôm genuinely laughing my ass off! Your belief is on a hope and a prayer that Ford ‚Äúpartners‚Äù with Google or Apple? I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs not possible but that isn‚Äôt a good look for a company if they have to partner with someone in order to stay competitive. Truth is, if Ford has to partner with some in order to compete what does that REALLY say about Tesla then??? If you ask me or sounds like you need to add the market cap of Apple and Ford at least in order to get a true market cap for Tesla so Tesla is still undervalued in my opinion..."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Didn‚Äôt I tell you it sounded crazy?!
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"I can‚Äôt remember where I saw the news article, I‚Äôm sure you can find it. But you want to know how I know Ford & GM won‚Äôt be competitive by 2025?! Because they have admitted it themselves! In a news article that leaked some snippets from a confidential email by some executives stated both companies will collectively only produce 350K EV‚Äôs in the year 2025. That doesn‚Äôt mean they aren‚Äôt making EV‚Äôs along the way mind you but Tesla has estimated that by 2025 they plan to sell at least ~ 4 million vehicles by then"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"I never said anything about gm, they whiffed when they turned down google for autonomous driving before Tesla was even a company. They‚Äôve turned things around since then sure.

As for 2025, they don‚Äôt need to be the number 1 ev manufacturer in the world. All that needs to happen is:
1) inflation takes hold and gets people scared, the bubble pops on Tesla. (Let‚Äôs be honest Tesla has a bright future, their current valuation unless you break them up is crazy and driven by offset credits though)
2) enough Eva are made to stop selling the credits to Tesla.
3) ford bites the bullet admits they can‚Äôt do it by themselves and pairs up with apple, google, Dyson who knows. Point is they admit they don‚Äôt have the tech and need help.

If those things happen in the next 5 years it‚Äôs possible that ford has a bigger cap then Tesla. That‚Äôs all I‚Äôm saying. Is what I wrote here really that crazy? You think the money printer is going to go burrrrr forever? If it stops who do you think is going to get hit? Plain old ford, or super sexy Tesla."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I can‚Äôt take you seriously anymore. You literally threw in Dyson to the mix! ROFL! they already threw in the towel as well! They made one prototype and then gave up when they realized it was too hard
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Genius, they threw in the towel because they realized they couldn‚Äôt make a car. It‚Äôs their battery tech that‚Äôs worth something not their car making ability. Ford can make cars, Dyson makes electronic motors and batteries for all their devices. That‚Äôs all I was getting at.

How about you answer my question. Money printer stops. Who drops? Ford or Tesla."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Currently? At this rate? it‚Äôs going to be Ford, lmao. Tesla has more cash then debt & Ford on the other hand has a ton of debt"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok this will be the last reply, because I need to get to work, it‚Äôs been great going back and forth because you always get perspective. I‚Äôll close with this.

What happens to the value of cash if rates go up and inflation rockets?

What happens to issued fixed rate debt when the same happens?"
2021-03-27 11:39:36,wallstreetbets,"Take care of your neurons during stressful market times. The neurotransmitter dopamine is an important modulator of neuronal signaling and circuit activation. Physical and psychological stressors activate brain dopaminergic circuits, which, in turn, lead to both acute and long-term changes in neural functions. Dopamine systems contribute to the generation of the stress response and to coping responses to stress via the coregulation of additional chemical transmitters. Regulation of dopamine release and receptor signaling is exquisitely sensitive to certain genetic and environmental perturbations during development and in adulthood. 

Individual variation in coping responses to stress has been correlated with differences in dopamine-related genes and dopamine neuron structure and firing patterns. Many of the dopamine neurons of the substantia nigra project to the striatum, another part of the basal ganglia that is made up of the caudate and putamen. In doing so they form a pathway called the nigrostriatal dopamine pathway that is thought to be crucial in the facilitation of movement. 

Stress is influencing dopamine production and negatively impacts the function of the substantia nigra. The influence of the substantia nigra on movement is made apparent by observing the symptoms of Parkinson's disease, which are associated with the death of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Although it still isn't clear what exactly causes neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease, when a significant number of these neurons have died, the individual will likely start to experience movement-related problems like tremors, rigidity, slowness of movement, and postural instability‚Äîall hallmark symptoms of Parkinson's disease. 

**TL:DR: Don't make your bad swing trades or dips hurt your substantia nigra. Take care of your neurons or your hands will be shaking, so you will make more bad trades. The market eventually will go up, but neural damage is permanent.**"

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"The blueprint of what he wanted to do with Chewy was just to copy Amazon's (very successful) business model. He built out an almost parallel distribution network to Amazon's. If Cohen had just opened an Amazon storefront, Chewy would probably function just about identically to how it does now for the end consumer. Only difference is that Cohen was able to sell his business to Petsmart for a bunch of money, while an Amazon storefront has to make money by actually selling product.

66% of Chewy's revenue also comes from monthly subscriptions for the same product.
With GME, gamers already buy their computer parts online and gamers don't buy the same product every month. The Amazon business model that made Cohen so much money before don't feel very applicable to Gamestop's customers."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Haha lol
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I can‚Äôt recall all that clearly because it was a long time ago but I remember people saying the same thing about Amazon back in the day. That it was a fools bet. The GME/Amazon connection being a fast distribution network to get hardware in 1-2 days shipped while dominating the digital portion for the software the same as Amazon does. Including content creation as well perhaps. Amazon did a great job stepping on everybodies backs to get to the top. The usps is basically Amazon‚Äôs bitch and now the use struggling brick and mortar stores for returns

the average wage in Canada is $55,000/year which means the majority of people in the country, at least 17 million, make $55,000/year or less. $200,000 would be life-changing for all of them. I've been working full time and saving my ass off for 5 years and I have maybe $35,000 to my entire existence lmao if you have hundreds of thousands of dollars to throw around, all the power to you my friend. but dont convince yourself you're not incredibly well-off lol"

I play with the compound interest calculator atleast weekly üòÇ

I'd probably put 275k profits in an ETF/high yield covered call/REIT/broad market

And then have the 25k as play money.

Free healthcare, no kids, and $1k+ pension after 65 makes this plan pretty great."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,What‚Äôs your ideal price target for your date range?
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have noticed in myself as I advanced myself in my career, at each plateau my base spending rises. So even though I make more the perception remains about what it was before.  
I finally decided to stop raising my standard spending, like keeping my old car up and running rather than getting a car payment (much cheaper if you keep up preventive maintenance) and invest more in my house doing upgrades and eating better.  Now I am trying to learn to invest.  
I am still a couple paychecks from insolvency but I‚Äôm trying to build that cushion more and more.  Saving has always been a difficult task for me.  

Long rambling story short, perceived position is real."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"I know a guy who showed me his books. He bought every low wave MACD share he could and would limit sell them for a 20% gain. Over eight years, the dude has nearly $125,500,000 in value, most of it is in ETFs now. The dude is 26. Talks about how he misses working because his days are incredibly boring and long. 

He's absolutely rich, but he acts like he works an average salary job and spends less than $2,500 a month. In a phone call with him, he pulled into a McDonald's drive through and ordered off the cheap side of the menu. His house isn't glorious or anything either.

The dude has the tendies, but lives like the rest of us. He wears stuff he can buy at Walmart, eats microwave meals, and drives an early 2010's Volkswagen Golf too. 

The only 'rich' thing I've seen him do is join the GME fight with 100k shares at $121.54 the other day. He groaned about having to withdraw from his ETF pool for it, but he openly stated that he has no intention to sell GME even if it breaks $1,000 per share.

I guess some rich people don't like being pretentious? I don't know."

I will be invested for at least 2 yrs.

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Absolutely! and everyone I know who makes good money does the same thing. They allow their living costs to raise with their wage. I have always been extremely disciplined about putting any excess income into savings and keeping my costs the same no matter what. It's ended relationships because the women didn't understand why I was choosing to live like that. Saving has come easy for me because I used to sleep in a tent and didn't know where my next meal would come from. Being really poor teaches you some valuable lessons. You'll get there my friend. I hope investing catches on for you, I'm still learning as well."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Thats very cool. I actually plan on doing something similar. It's easy to make money when you have money so why not just throw big sums into growth stocks and realize modest gains over and over again. Love that he stays disciplined about it all too. The years he spends living poor now will save him many poor years later after all that money keeps compounding. Love to see it!

Self driving tech along with drone technology is going to be huge."

&#x200B;

Explanation: Thought GME was gonna go up after the fat dip. I was wrong. Thought GME was gonna be volatile into Friday. I was wrong. This was on a week that I barely had time to look at the market. Risk tolerance went out the window in hopes of even more sizable gains. Learned my lesson. No more weeklies. Fuckkkkkkk. That money would have really helped my family and I just threw it out the window. Now I'm stuck listening to ""The Tendieman"" and ""Buyin' the Dip"" on repeat and using RH until I'm able to transfer to another broker.

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm about half your size, but the big thing that has helped me avoid catastrophic pullbacks like this is forcing myself to cool off for a few days after a big win. Otherwise I get so high that I lose all risk aversion, and start imagining future chart moves that are based on no DD at all. I start chasing strength instead of making the difficult plays that feel like they can‚Äôt possibly be good, but then they are. It‚Äôs a delicate balance to cool off, but not so much that you stop trading and turn into a totally risk averse pussy.

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol for fucking real. Let‚Äôs see ur returns since 100% is sooooo unimpressive to you. Fuckin douche
2021-03-27 06:57:50,wallstreetbets,"UPDATE: 1 year to the day; 10k to 40k. What‚Äôs the big deal? OG post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fpne4g/if_you_have_patience_and_10k_heres_a_freebie_for/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

So I set a remindme bot notification, because tbh with you, I wanted to see how my DD would play out. While I decided to make other investments, it turns out that my original DD was literally right on the fuckin money.

One year ago I wrote a deep DD on this forum, long before the days of GME, regarding SPY and the market volatility. My play was to make 90x 500c expiring 12/22. At the time, the initial investment was supposed to be around $10,000 - because that is what I was working with, personally. And while I really believed in myself and my research that was oerformed on the fly, I myself chose to invest elsewhere. SPY options were eating me up. Not the LEAPs I mentioned, thats important to point out. 

Anyways, since I performed the DD and set a reminder, I ran my numbers and also re-read my own due diligence on SPY. I set a price window of 40k to 108k (value of the original 10k investment)

Turns out that the initial investment one year ago today of $10,080.00 into 90 $500c would now be worth $43,740.00. Just over the low end of what I
predicted. If anybody made a play off of this DD, I congratulate you, and I invite you to message me with speculative plays.

Granted, I‚Äôm an ape like you. But truth be told, my prediction was literally spot on, and I know there are few people who post solid DD‚Äôs on this sub (trust me i look), so the fact that 1 year after this prediction, my prediction was spot on (at the lower end), I‚Äôm pretty proud of myself. And you still have a year an 9 months left if you made this play. Good luck to all of you. üòâ

Edit: Everybody with your big dick energy, take it over there. I‚Äôm just following up on a decent prediction I made a year ago today, with a fair bit of market analysis. If you wanna talk about what you could have made on other stocks, by all means, have at it. A ton of shit can change in a year. It‚Äôs only fair that I follow up on my own post to show people I wasn‚Äôt wrong. Now take it for what it‚Äôs worth or post some fuckin DD. I need money too....nobody said they got rich off my
play. I simply did a follow up. For fuckin Christ‚Äôs sake. Haters gon hate.

Edit 2: LoL at the queers in here baggin on the play. Post some winners in here ya homos."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,hindsight is 20/20
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hang on. So, you didn‚Äôt make this play? Are you now up to more than 43k on whatever you did instead?"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"You're a fucking dumbass lol this is the stupidest shit ive ever read. Yeah ""dd"" on spy what a joke. Unlesss you combed through each company you didn't do shit, and buying leaps on ANYTHING post covid would make you money, probably even more money. I want to call you a retard but you don't deserve the title, posting shit like this for attention. ALSO YOU DIDNT EVEN MAKE THIS PLAY????"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,a freebie that you made exactly $0 from. incredible
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,A year ago if you bought similar OTM options on countless other stocks you would have made far more money.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,DD is great but how much coin did you make off your own advice?

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Okay what's the fucking story here. This guy has done a 180 and I keep wondering what is he up to. What does his uncle wall street got this schill doing now. It's either that or his ratings are dropping fast because even boomers are seeing what he is.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"And.... Don't Trust Cramer!! 

Buttons and sound effects are not financial advice."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I no longer listen to anyone on TV but Cramer has a better record than any of those CNBC morons on any show there.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,OBEY!
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Cramer .... The best contra indicator in the market. His CNBC bro Brian Kelly is also reliably on the wrong side. The Unknown Trading Wizards book has a great mention on Brian Kelly by a trader. Stock pickers are like black belts. Everyone has one.

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"""Stop buying on margin""

This advice is fundamentally wrong - most Americans can now get margin at a 2.5% fee rate which is incredible value when used responsibly. This type of advice is equivalent to saying you shouldn't own a credit card because you might get slapped with 30% APR if you forget to pay your bills. Meanwhile, using a credit card means you can get cashback (literal free money) and other intangible benefits like fraud protection and being able to keep a larger cash reserve over an intramonth period.

Don't max out your margins. Don't use it on stocks that have ""high"" beta (definition of high depends on your risk tolerance). If you're new, pick ETFs that have 50%/25% initial/maintenance requirements."

2021-03-27 05:50:03,wallstreetbets,"$GME Potential Pattern: Cup with Handle Analysis Part 2. Bullish handle breakout analysis ‚Äì MACD, W%R, DMI based analysis. With other examples this time! First things first, here is where we are with some pretty lines drawn in:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mrw4w3sw6hp61.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=3000cf6d8e93869b0118d540ecaca36b2637e73d

Second things second, let‚Äôs take a look at the updated conditions we discussed in the first post:

According to Investopedia, there are a few conditions for a real cup with handle chart pattern:

&#x200B;

1. **Trend:** To qualify as a continuation pattern, a prior trend should exist. Ideally, the trend should be a few months old and not too mature. **Check**
2. **Cup:** The cup should be ‚ÄúU‚Äù shaped and resemble a bowl or rounding bottom. A ‚ÄúV‚Äù shaped bottom would be considered too sharp of a reversal to qualify. **Check**
3. **Cup Depth:** Ideally, the depth of the cup should retrace 1/3 or less of the previous advance. However, with volatile markets and over-reactions, the retracement could range from 1/3 to ¬Ω. **Kinda check?** We fell from 483 to around 38 so this was a very abnormal retracement, and so we need to be a little wary, and I still stand by this. **Updated**: However, at this point we can say GME is not a textbook example so the depths might be less of a factor.
4. **Handle:** After the high forms on the right side of the cup, there is a pullback that forms the handle. Sometimes this handle resembles a flag or pennant that slopes downward, other times it is just a short pullback. The handle represents the final consolidation/pullback before the big breakout and can retrace up to 1/3 of the cup's advance, but usually not more. The smaller the retracement, the more bullish the formation and significant the breakout. **Kinda check again? Updated:** At this point it may be safe to say that the textbook depths do not really apply. We have fallen out of 1/3 and even 1/2 depths, and there is reason to be wary. However, this might not really matter for GME.
5. **Duration:** The cup can extend from 1 to 6 months, sometimes longer on weekly charts. The handle can be from 1 week to many weeks and ideally completes within 1-4 weeks. Almost there. **Updated: Check**
6. **Volume:** There should be a substantial increase in volume on the breakout above the handle's resistance. **Updated: 50 Million Volume to go from closing 120 to closing 180. There is definitely momentum here. Previous resistance of 172 broken. Check**

Okay, so now let‚Äôs look at the handle:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2xt3t0v27hp61.png?width=494&format=png&auto=webp&s=82cb794baa796b3147084a004f425523e2d72a6f

We can see here that +DI and -DI are diverging, signaling bullish sentiment. W%R slipped into a strong overselling signal on 3/24, and then on 3/25 it moved sharply towards the middle. This means the stock is starting to be more bought than sold. The MACD histogram is growing in momentum, 3/24 being the most negative day.

So great! It looks like there could be a breakout forming here. But now what? How long does it go for and what can we expect? Well let‚Äôs look at historical examples:

Here is the textbook Investopedia example, WYNN on monthly candles:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9otqyu887hp61.png?width=494&format=png&auto=webp&s=02d2c757c8c2795ae0382155dfa9c5316ea88fc3

We can see that when there is a breakout in the handle, the bullish movement pushed the price to go above previous cup resistances. However, after the breakout the price of the stock free falls down almost to previous cup support levels:

Okay now you may be saying, this is so zoomed out and candles are months ect, ect, ect. This is simply the Investopedia textbook example. Lets look at another more recent one.

Here is NVDA on daily candles:

Here is what happened after the run up, as you can see this stock kept running up after the handle breakout:

All of this is just information. I hope you take it with a grain of salt! If a true cup with handle pattern forms and the breakout of the handle happens, then we know prices run up at least to the previous resistance. Until that happens its hard to say what's next!

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Can‚Äôt you use the depth of the cup to project the target price? At least in the first WYNN example the depth is 150-50=100$. So the projected price would be 150+100=250$ which is around where it went. 247$. If we apply the same analysis we can roughly estimate gme cup depth to be 300-50=250$. 250+300=550$.

1st - I drank my morning coffee 

2nd- used the tea spoon that I add my sugar with as my cup -bent the handle upwards 42 degrees.

3rd - went to the junk drawer and found duct tape 

4th- grabbed wife‚Äôs wooden spoon ( she may or may not know I‚Äôm using it as I‚Äôm not allowed to play with her things )  and taped it to original tea spoon bent at 42.0 degrees 

** Paused for Morning binger / Bing !

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,This is more reminiscent of Halliford's one sleeve shirt pattern.  At the end we should expect to see the MAC D  link with MAC G at the top corner of a base triangle layer that's been forming really since '18.   Calling target price of 478 as the sleeve reaches down and grabs another sleeve in the coming days.  Expect to see a rising pleat formation until perhaps a deep v neck dip.

but who even cares about these crayons ? we seen so much people doing their analysis but in the end the fking short attack comes and destroys the whole thing. so we can speculate everyday, "" based on this trend and that resistanse and this high and this low its gonna go like that"" but it never does. yes the toilet and a handle is looking nice i must admit. 

but this game is so rigged i cant even watch these predictions. its like astrology.

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ayy nice! Whether you use technicals or not, being able to read candle stick charts is very useful since it gives you one more outlook on the stock"

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes of course sir, and what brand and color of crayon would you like with your unlimited tendies plan?"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,You're so smart Ashu hahaha wow
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"You care. We get it, and appreciate it. More importantly we're holding with you. 

I like the stock."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Cup, handle, mouth, drink"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Can you elaborate?
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Way
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Way
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Way
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,One thing which really helps is watching a stock (GME) for most of a day and making time stamp notes of rising prices and declining prices.  Then go find the candlesticks for the same day and match the time stamps to what specific candles appear. Makes it much easier to visualize how and what trend was occurring at multiple points in the day which are still memorable. Then apply those same candle formations to other charts and I begin to relate them much more effectively. Plus with my notes I can ‚Äúcheck‚Äù my interpretations
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I can be a bit OCD sometimes and it went into patterns both simple and complex.  Took me a minute to figure out combining candlesticks into various patterns etc. I think I got it now though. Hehe
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Can I get a 2009 Enchanted Forest Crayola scented crayon? I've heard it's an amazing vintage with an exquisite taste.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Profit>too diamond handed (tarded) to take profits> take loss instead
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,High volatility stocks are not good for analysis lol
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well I didn't know you are talking about patterns. I just meant that understanding candles themselves is easy as fuck imo. They just represent high, low, open and close price of given time-step. Which is infinitely more informative than plain line chart."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ah yes, very good sir the 2009 vintage of the Enchanted Forest Crayola is highly sought after. The taste profile has hints of horses roaming freely across a meadow and the crispness of an Alpine Forest. 

[Does this satisfy the gentleman?](https://i.imgur.com/0Nd07mu.jpg)"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Also agreed but....they do provide accelerated changes in combinations.  IE: more Hammers, Stars and Doji in a shorter period of time.

I have been applying what I learned to other less volatile stocks  IE BB, NOK, SBUX etc just to try and glean better interpretations.  GME's Candles are insanely active in both directions.

In summation:  Now I have a few excuses to use when all I have to show after all this is a bunch of loss porn.  lol  Time for breakfast...where are my crayons? ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|thumbs_up)"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Roger that.  Yea...I never even looked at stocks before mid January but F me, its actually really interesting.  I am a professional pilot and am only working a couple or three days per week still so I have a lot of time to devote to learning this, that and the other.    
  I wanted to understand what the candlesticks mean in combination with each other so I set out to do just that.  Understand though, the margin for error on my interpretations is massive but I feel like I certainly understand a lot more than I did too."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Good heavens I didn't know so many could exist in one place very well I shall be highly satisfied.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"I disagree, you look at enough indicators and analyze every chart you‚Äôll eventually find a pattern to support your beliefs. GME barely lines up with anything, TA is already not adamant and applying it to volatile stocks is silly."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm very new to this as well but my advice would be to start with the basics. Candles are just a way to represent price in time.  Of course you can look at this representation and try to predict the future. I believe finding patterns in prices is called Technical analysis. You should not trade while solely relying on Technical analysis, that's like rolling a dice, although it can be helpful sometimes."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"We here at the Crayon Inn pride ourselves knowing we can deliver the most exceptional crayons, in bulk to our customers."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ah ha...but it does give me a very wide assortment of candles to interpret.  I know GME is the exception and NOT the rule by any stretch. Hence why I follow less volatile stocks and try to discern the patterns which on stocks with ‚Äúnormal‚Äù volatility can be much more difficult to interpret as they are more subtle. 
GME changes direction and gears like someone who never drove stick before is trying to drive up a mountain üèî it‚Äôs a wonder the computers which generate this data haven‚Äôt totally melted down yet. Lol
Also I have the advantage of knowing what actually happened along the way so, the ability to sorta check my ‚Äúanswers‚Äù"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"You should see me with the Greeks. 
Talk about a total retard at work. Oyy!!"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Agreed.  Candlesticks are but one tool in a very massive toolbox.  Decisions should be based off conclusions arrived at only after applying all the tools to try and assemble a fact based final conclusion.  I just got tired of not understanding even the most basic elements of Candlesticks and wanted to learn them.  
As an example of my conservativism, I have been doing this since mid January and still to this day have not done any Puts and only 2 calls, both on AMC NOT GME.  ( I made 200$ on each of my calls.  Sold both before the expiration and scurried off with my beer money) 
I am a bloody retard when it comes to puts.  I just can't process them in me noodle."

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I was quite happy buying at $160...  this guy must be SUPER happy buying at $190.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I figured I‚Äôm fine as long as I get in before $420.69
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I was out of cash lol
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,ü§£
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Hodlor !!
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Get a decent job, gamble one years salary. Is this hard to imagine?"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Everytime i come here i really feel like its just a bunch of bullshit. Theres way to many people claiming blowing large sums of money on this. I cant tell if its photoshops for karma, rich kids, or  degenerate gamblers."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Work.


Where the fuck do you get your money?"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"The dips help me because it means i am able to add more bananas for cheaper üòÇ. I'm in at $197 so any dips below are discounts and i add whenever i have spare money. Even if its only 1 share they all add up and i know that each one will multiply multiple times so. I can't understand the logic of these hedgies, they keep shorting more non existent shares. Surely they realise they are just increasing the amount if tendies they will have to give us, i think they think that we will get bored and sell our losses, oh hell nawww. Will just buy more so they have less real shares.  Looking forward to this moon trip... i am holding with a true diamond hand retard grip. Even when the price goes to 1k plus i will still be holding. I believe GME is and will be a great company going forward with RC. So the price is guaranteed way higher then current prices even if the squeeze wasn't in play (but it isüòÇüòÇ) they are not dealing with normal share holders here, they are playing with diamond handed apes.. with a good grip, the odd paperhands which is to be expected and the few who cannot handle the big swings.. thing is not to let emotion rule you. The big drops do not bother me in the slightest. I have been there at $344 and then watched it go back down over half, i know the game they play but it doesn't bother me, opportunity to add more, HOLD like its your wifes boyfriends dick and eventually it will be the mother of all ejaculations, enjoy the build up retards üòÇ"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Still a dip innit
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Tis but a flesh wound.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Why? Asking for a friend

Edit: Sooo... ""Go do my own DD"" and ""I will see"" is the reason? Also, why is the short interest in a stock so hard to pin down?"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"lol amc does nOT have a turnaround story, thus it wont squeeze like tits"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, I don't think I will."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,# CUT IT
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Lets go
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,!Remind me 1 month
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck I hope so I can bring my average down
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, in your head."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Buy puts then bitch. Triple dog dare you, Specs."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I bought recently at $184 just before the plummet to $120. I regret that one. Wish I held out one more day to pick up literally double the amount of shares (would've went deeper in at the $120 price point).
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Hail Satan
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just some advice, Ape to Ape, try not to get overly emotionally invested in this. I'm not saying don't ride it, but no one knows how this is gonna play out. If shit goes south though I want you to be able to get up and keep fighting. Life is a war not a battle."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Me not so happy at $340 right before the tank...
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck up your credit and take out the largest personal loan you can afford until we're on the moon
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"$97K yearly salary doesn‚Äôt mean you get to keep it all. You have taxes, costs so if you manage to save 20% (or a bit more if still living with mommy and daddy) of it on a yearly basis I think it‚Äôs good. So based on this, this dude just gambled the money he saved for 5 years on a stock that is purely pumped. So it is hard to imagine this kind of stupidity yeah... üòÇ Also makes me wonder how he even got a good paying job in the first place with such intellect..."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Wow thanks Einstein. I had no idea. If you bother to read the questions again I was asking what kind of work.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol yeah... I bought in super high... around $300s and then avgd the one account down to $160... Im $100 avg in my other account, hedgies are big dumb. Their games aren‚Äôt working"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,30k is a flesh wound?! That would cripple the shit out of me.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"I cbf to explain over my phone, but you can check out the DD on the whole GME situation.

Basically rough estimates put the actual short positions at somewhere between 500% and 900%.

That means that Citadel and friends owe five to nine times the available shares.

There are approximately 50 million shares of gamestop available to trade. These guys have shorted this stock at least 250 million (latest numbers I saw was 650M), and will have to buy back these shares that many times.

With a demand that is 5 times (at minimum) larger than the available float, it's inevitable that these shares will sky-rocket in price."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Didn‚Äôt gme already squeeze though? Only reason I bought amc was because it hasn‚Äôt squeezed yet thus more upside potential
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Lets go

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,There is a reminder tool but I don't know how to use it.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol, it would be funny to watch his cash poof but the reality is it would just help Citadel pay interest so they can prolong covering"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah i did the same thing that was my 215 day. Then i got some at 130
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Rebuke
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"This you have said ape.. is great advice... Life is a War.. And for sure we‚Äôre in a War.. I put what I can afford to lose... even if it‚Äôs big... 

I‚Äôve lost more than that on very stupid ventures.. why not fight this one proper with the attention it deserves?? 

Then I wouldn‚Äôt have no regret for having half-assed into it... I‚Äôm sure you understand what I‚Äôm talking about! I‚Äôll give it MY best shot, and whichever way it goes, 

I‚Äôve signed up and reserved myself to the eventual outcome.. Pros and Cons, right? Wins and Loses, a Made-Man and A Scrapping Man, Fulfilled Potential over Unrealized Potential.. 

And so the list goes on and on and on and on and... I wanna be on the Winning Side of this one.. But if ever it goes South, then it comes back to known Territory.. This is where and how I live now.. 
This is the Way"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I was at $310 but avg down to $235 buying dips lol might throw down more tomorrow if the price is juicy
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Think of the january homies that bought at 400+
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Ape STRONG
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Come on man, don't tell them people are actually losing money! You are only supposed to talk about lambos, moons, and bananas!"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I got 108s and I got 315s... It all balances out
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,-this is not financial advice-
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Taxes?
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"He's not stupid, he's retarded..... retard."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Even better is the more they do the games the more resilient the apes become. It may have been nerve racking for some before now we just don't give a fuck. I believe in the company and RC. hedgies just give a bit of extra excitement. I hold through highs and buy the lows. I am holding for 5 years unless it hits 50k to 1million then i will sell half and ride the rest for the 5 years.. i imagine hedgie tears taste salty üòÇ
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Then you bet too much then you can afford to lose.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôd love to see a legitimate link to where it says 500% to 900%. I swear this number keeps going up exponentially every few weeks in this sub. After the first squeeze it was touted as being 140% then for a few weeks it was 200%. Both of these are semi realistic but now the numbers you‚Äôve provided seem a bit fantastical
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Username checks out
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"I see, a fellow ape with no DD. there is no next gme, gme is the next gme"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"There is too much share dilution in AMC. It is a big ass slush fund. $19 was the moon, $14 was a nice run. It may run again though, who knows. GME was always the real play. AMC was a fun P and D."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôd rather stay but thanks for the invite.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Pretty easy dude, you can google ""remind me bot reddit"" for a full tutorial. Let's say you want to be reminded of my comment in 1 week.  You just have to reply to my comment with ""!Remind me 1 week"""
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"RIP I overslept, said to myself I'd buy a little bit in the morning if AH didn't blow it up... AH did not blow it up, I just slept until it was already $140."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Cramer
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,$120 was so tempting but I got so scared when the stock market went deep red 2 days ago. Now regreting not buying the dips at $120. Would have gotten by cost down a lot. Man....ugh I suck at this game.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fellow ape, the market isn‚Äôt open tomorrow."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Good luck today, lol. Definitely one of us."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Pst, I‚Äôm not even flinching. Don‚Äôt even need that money. Still got $4 in my savings. One slice of pizza every two days. Not even scared.






*Dear Lord please make it go back up to $340. I swear to god I will never gamble again. I beg you lord.‚Äù"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah on your salary lol. The employment contract will state your annual salary before taxes? You know those money that come out of your bank and go to IRS? Taxes üòÇ
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm sure it's all linked in the DD if you can be bothered to read.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,But did it not already squeeze in January?
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Let‚Äôs go
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Let‚Äôs go
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,!Remind me 1 week
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Many thanks for the lesson.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol I missed out on the $120 low price but I managed to grab some on the way back up. I don‚Äôt like to fight the current. I like to boost the green candles
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"I feel ya bro, totally the same"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't think this is what people meant when they said it would be the greatest redistribution of wealth on this planet. I thought it meant people would MAKE money, not lose it all to institutions while we scream hold!"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Sir this is a casino
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"That isn‚Äôt dd though. It‚Äôs a random conglomeration of assumptions made by people who don‚Äôt understand market mechanics or how things like short volume work. In fact, most of the people writing that shit probably started trading less than a month ago lol.

The blind and retarded leading the blind and retarded."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,# YES
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Robbinghood stopped buys retard, think again. It was only delayed"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Let‚Äôs go
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"You‚Äôre right.  Fuck it, let‚Äôs go."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Shit. Let‚Äôs go.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I bought at $87. I like the stock
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, this is Patrick!"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, that's probably true.

People touting ""$1 000 000 per share"" are obviously blind. Nobody is getting $1 000 000 for one gamestop share.

That said, it does seem like there is a little more to squeeze out of this thing. Might shoot up for one final run. Maybe like $300-$500 a share again? Who knows.

Almost certainly a bit of an echo chamber on here from people who started trading only recently.

The 500% SI figures do seem a bit fantastical tbh. It's pretty unlikely that a bunch of apes from the internet randomly become millionares from throwing money at a stock."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I would agree with you if the short interest wasn't 18%.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Da baby
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Same in at 60 and back in at 90 on Jan 26th ish
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"It could possibly hit those numbers again, just keep in mind that 99% of what you read in there is coming from people that are probably dumber than you are"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok don't try to convert Christians to atheism.

If they want to see the sky green, they'll see it."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"synthetic shares, the short % isn't accurate. There's plenty DD on GME that shows how many shares Citadel messes with in the dark pools"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"My order book looks like it's been hit by drunk toddler have buys ranging from $40 and all way up and down up to $300 range, am I doing this right?"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,But the reported short interest used to be 140% a few months ago. Why did it go down? Do you think they're lying about it to create the impression that they covered?
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Something about averaging
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs even about the short interest anymore. The fact is there is millions upon millions of shares that are failed to deliver that still need to be paid for.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Average dollars are costly - or something like that
2021-03-27 05:39:58,wallstreetbets,"I decided to pay my folks back for all the money they've spent at Gamestop on me over the years! They're the real Apes. &#x200B;

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"The look in your mom's eyes says you're about a quarter-million-dollars short, bud."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,The check is dated for 4/20?
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"What a lousy investment for your parents?  All the money and all the years, only a measly $5K coming back.  A annualized return of -20%.

Make this a 1st installment.  Your parents are proud of you."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Check is void due to name on cheque not matching ID
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,how much you paying them back for the public humiliation of posing with the novelty foam core check like they hit the lottery?
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,This brothers acting like he handed them a million dollar cheque
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Very good, Ape! Nice check number and I see you post dated it to 4/20! Job well done!"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Perhaps they should use it to buy a second piece of furniture..
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Hahahaha now I have your bank account numbers!
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"If my son gave me a check that big and it was 5k I would probably punch him. M

Seriously though, glad you gave back to the people that gave you so much."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Are you sure they are your parents? Or is this an excuse to show us your wife and his boyfriend all together ? LOL
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"I gave my mum ¬£3000 for ""past sins"" and she said: ""where's the rest?"""
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,all that for 5k lol
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,They‚Äôre probably annoyed you spent money on the giant check. That would be my moms beef.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lacks watermark, does not cheque out."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Jokes on you! I screenshot this and deposited it through my banks app. Now I can buy 5k worth of GME on monday!
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Your dad is Ken Griffin?
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,So you sold? Weak
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"You're a good egg, Noonan..."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,If someone ever hands me a giant cheque it better have at least 100k on it
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Humble brag.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,best feeling is helping your sweet parents. i love it
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Next level cute idea <3
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,you beautiful ape
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Cheap bastard. U know we go to 1M/share, right? Guess ur mom also knows"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Bro you have the same bank account number as me!
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"I can relate to this a lot. Been sendin Mom my tendies since January. Both my parents work in the travel industry and have been laid off coming up on a year now. 

My next move is to buy them a house on Shitadel's dime. Short attack again, I'll BTFD... again."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wholesome as frig. Love those who loved your first, then shower them with fat stacks."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Big vibes!!!!!!!!
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,All of this set up for $5k?
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,You'd think checks those size would be for amounts of at least 5 figures.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,i like to imagine the cost of getting a novelty cheque printed was like 10% of the amount
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Love to see it. How many parents spent tons on their kids gaming gear to never see any of that money back. Love it.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,April 20th?.....  oh I see
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,They invested in a legend that remembers to look after mum  and dad for their sacrifices and time.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Apes need to visit Gamestop website and get some cool things for the lil apes and battle axe. Xmas is creeping up, and now is a good time to support daddy cohen."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Back to the Future STONK
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"I feel that, brother. My goal is to buy my parents house and pay off their mortgage this year so they can retire."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Okay before I go into all the comedy. How much did you make off of gme?
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Routing & account #  (bottom of check) check out! 

Deposit cleared in my RH account this morning.  
They are now in for $GME where this belongs."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs a lot of bananas
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is so wholesome. Heart eyes, major"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I want a giant check
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes I plan to do the same. I made this promise to my dad who left me last year to be with his God. I want to also recover all of his losses he made in penny stocks. I got my mom to invest in it a bit as well. So want to cover all their losses and give them gains. To the moon!!!
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice gesture.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the Way
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"the comments here are shitty, joking or not. Who cares about the cost of the check or the fact it's 'only $5000'? apes here sat and donated $350,000 to adopt gorillas and give them meme names to help their cause and give back, meanwhile this dude's trying give something back to his parents as a nice gesture and he gets grilled."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,My dad wears jorts too.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Such a wonderful son who helps his parents! 
I hope I can do the same one day!"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,You know you gonna have to pay taxes right
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,spotted an only child
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I see you went for the classic 420 69 ref
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,My dad would take me to GameStop to buy used games and then he‚Äôd return them as soon as I left his house
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Don't we al wish we could?
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,grats
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,This is fantastic well done!!
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Where can I get one of those giant checks at?
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way!
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Where you get that big check?? Haha
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,**April 20th**.... hilarious dude!
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Time travel?
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,What a nice event to celebrate on Hitler's Birthday.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Five k? Those are rookie numbers bro.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,you did this for $5k?  holy fuck dude that's actually pretty sad
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Seeing you dont own gamestop this doesn't check out. Fake ass check ü§£
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,YOU THE REAL MVP!
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,How much did you pay for the big cheque?
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Fantastic work!
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Should have wrote the check for $6,969. Would‚Äôve been worth the extra tendies."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs awesome!!! where did you get this giant check? I want one...
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Imagine trying this hard to go viral
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I like the date
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,RESPEKKIT
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,That's awesome
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol. I like how the richer apes in here are scoffing at 5k being a little amount of money. Forgetting that these dudes parents probably have a better ROI than they do overall. Or well aware about it and salty.

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,You can make a check by writing shit on a napkin. This huge one has fake account and routing numbers but the size has nothing to do with whether it's valid or not.

Only Looking at the near term OI expiries, is like looking through a telescope and seeing the Sun then wrongly concluding that the Sun is the biggest source of gravitational pull in space.  In fact however, the Sun orbits the center of the Milky way galaxy, where there's this HUGE blackhole pulling the entire galaxy towards it. While the Milky Way galaxy itself is moving away from the big bang, bound together by the common gravity of the Local galaxy group that contains Andromeda, Triangulum, Large Megalanic Clouds, M32 and many others. 

So you got all this gravitational effects overlapping each other, which is kinda what delta/gamma is on the price, that's why **you need to sum across ALL strikes and expiries to get an accurate reading on price direction, hence the  calculator**. This works extremely well for $GME because the move since February was mostly due to gamma.

For next week, the friendly neighborhood üêã will be busy avoiding whalers with harpoons and has other stuff to attend to, so it'll be up to the ü¶çü¶çü¶ç to do this themselves.

2021-03-27 05:19:42,wallstreetbets,"ZeroG34R's Friday DD - ($MVIS) Edit: I originally posted this Friday evening and was promptly filtered by the automod. I did not realize YT videos are not permitted unless given an exception. I've messaged the mods in hopes they show mercy and permit them along with this post.

Greetings, my fellow degenerates.

Each week on Friday I sit in anticipation of weekly DD's from NrdRage and AllDatDalton but they aren't posting up this week. At a loss for what to do with my time, I've decided to try my hand at writing my first ever DD on a company I greatly enjoy and believe in, $MVIS.

Now, you might hear that and be thinking something like, ""ugh, another fucking tech stock I thought the NASDAQ wiped you all out in the blood bath this week"". Yeah, I'm not gonna lie this week was rough but I believe this is a gift horse and so I'm here to share with you all why I think I can ride this shit all the way to the fucking bank.

**Disclaimer**: I am not a financial advisor. Much like many of you, I am absolutely a retarded degenerate and no one should be listening to me. Highlighting my profile reveals that I do not have the greatest tally of karma points - which is yet another reason you shouldn't be listening to me. Even worse, I'm one of the '*newfriends*' that joined the past few months. While I, as a rule, try to just shut up and read/lurk to learn and make plays based on what I think are logically valid points, I actually feel strongly enough about this to say something hopefully worthwhile. I'm one of those, don't post up unless you think you have something good to say kinds of people. In any case, do your own DD and make your own financial decisions. This is not financial advice, it is just me sharing information for entertainment purposes.

That said, $MVIS, as you might have already heard is a company based in Redmond, Washington. They make cool-ass technology - laser scanning, projection, 3D sensors, and image capturing. They are perhaps best known for their LiDAR - arguably the best LiDAR on the market - by being years ahead of its time/competition. This LiDAR helps cars ""see"" when driving and will be a main driver in the adoption of the next auto-revolution - a revolution that seems to be coming much faster than anticipated with EV breakthroughs and Biden's upcoming infrastructure plan. This company has seen major success with its long-range sensors which are currently slated for APR (ahead of schedule).

In case you're just waking up from a coma from the past week, the NASDAQ has been taking a huge steaming shit all over tech. That's dropped $MVIS to below $14.00/share which is an *absolute steal*. It may drop more next week, who knows, but at the time of writing this, the price is $13.33/share (down from its ATH of $24.00/share during the pop Mid-Feb). I was expecting it to go to its MAR 5th-8th level of $11-12/share to load up more but here we are. My point is, it's a good fucking price right now and if it keeps dropping, all the more reason to get in if you aren't already.

# But why would you want to get in?

Well, recently there have been some great developments. I'll list them here:

1. Positive earnings call for Q4 earnings on March 11 - for notes: [https://www.reddit.com/r/MVIS/comments/m3c9li/mvis\_earning\_call\_key\_notes/](https://www.reddit.com/r/MVIS/comments/m3c9li/mvis_earning_call_key_notes/) (there's also some good comments in that thread with snippets of quotes taken from the call).
2. Has continued to see a shuffling of the board with the most recent departure being Yalon Farhi: [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/65770/000117184321002033/exh\_991.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/65770/000117184321002033/exh_991.htm)
3. Has been hiring like crazy with the recent postings for hardware, software, and engineering: [http://jobs.jobvite.com/microvision/jobs?nl=1&fr=false#%2Fp%2Flist](http://jobs.jobvite.com/microvision/jobs?nl=1&fr=false#%2Fp%2Flist). In fact, they just filled the role for a Senior HR Generalist so I would expect this process to ramp up.
4. Received an interesting LinkedIn comment from BYD's Samuel Kang (Head of Total Technology Solutions NA - *the world's largest battery & EV manufacturer*) who commented: ""We believe in Microvision"": [https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6780973907391459329/?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A(activity%3A6780971110726008833%2C6780973868107620353)](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6780973907391459329/?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A(activity%3A6780971110726008833%2C6780973868107620353))
5. During a fireside chat, CFO Steve Holt explained how a ""strategic investment"" could really benefit stockholders. Holt stated that *one* of the Tier 1 Tech companies may prefer to dip their foot in the water with a *small strategic investment* to begin with and then after development milestones and timeline was met, buyout the company at a *much larger valuation.* Interestingly, Holt *seemed* to be saying that such an investor was *already on that hook*. It is speculated that the *strategic investment* is the deal they know they have now. This investment required some operating runway for which $MVIS raised easily in FEB when they announced a ""$50 M At-the-Market Equity Facility"" (shares were filled at $20.00 at the time).
6. *Coincidentally*, Dr. Spitzer and Judy Curran joined the Board of Directors in mid-late 2020. One is a *world-renowned* *expert* in NED and the other is a *world-renowned expert* in automotive engineering and testing. On March 2nd, Seval Oz joined the $MVIS Board of Directors. What do all of these new board members have in common? *Google*. These 3 new directors, as well as CEO Sumit Sharma, have deep ties to Google. *Even more coincidentally*, *all* 50 M ATM shares were sold to Financial Advisor, Craig Hallum, and *there is* *no disclosure required from the SEC* for him to say *who* he sold the shares to. One could therefore infer with good reason that between the timing, hires, and coincidental events falling into place that there is an M&A agreement with Google. Certainly, Google has the money to pay a ""much larger valuation"" for a buyout. They're also no stranger to acquiring competitive tech. But let's say it *wasn't* Google. There are still plenty of other T1 buyers in the wings that are highly interested in $MVIS, their products, and their patents. So it is a realistic probability they'll be purchased.
7. Is a rising stock this year - returned over 155.85% from January in the climb from $5.21 to $13.33. My conservative price target is between $90-125 EoY. Now, $MVIS isn't exactly a 'young' company. It's been around longer than some of you have been alive having been founded in 1993 (Ugh, I feel fucking old writing that). $MVIS's *hay-day* according to the chart was back in 2000 when shares were trading between $200-$500/share (with inflation, that would be equal to $305-$763.69 today). Today, their market cap is approx. $1.5 B... a historical high. So, if you look at the long charts, you'll see this long ass flatline from 2012 until now. So why am I so bullish all of a sudden (or rather, what has changed)? 2 reasons: (1) potential buyout (RE: points 5 & 6 + r/MVIS DD rumor mill posts over time); (2) good old bullish TA.

# Technical Analysis

If you've made it this far, you're probably bored AF and tired of reading. I confess that I cannot draw worth a damn on the charts so instead here are some videos that illustrate this far better than I can what's up with $MVIS. You can do your own DD by reviewing them at your leisure to gain some insight as to what's happened over time.

1. Chartology - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boTOoA1p8d4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boTOoA1p8d4)This is just the latest MVIS video (Mar 22 pre-NASDAQ shit show) but there is a good archive of other MVIS videos if you're interested in getting a sense of the history.
2. Gator Traders - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwQtuPKVWiE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwQtuPKVWiE)Again, the latest video (streamed today Mar 26th). Also has an archive of TA for comparison.
3. Flash Instincts - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MNhj8Uip-8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MNhj8Uip-8)The latest MVIS video was on the double pennant forming (March 25th). Not a huge MVIS analyzer but still relevant because ~~he satisfies my confirmation bias~~ has good points despite the thunderstorm behind him making his video annoying to listen to.

# Buyout & Valuation Potential

Given the above, there are a number of signs the company is about to be acquired: [https://www.griproom.com/fun/10-signs-your-company-is-about-to-be-acquired](https://www.griproom.com/fun/10-signs-your-company-is-about-to-be-acquired)

One could argue that acquiring $MVIS is equivalent to acquiring *at least* 4 different companies depending on how you want to look at their LiDAR verticals: (1) Auto LiDAR; (2) Consumer LiDAR; (3) Augmented Reality; and (4) Interactive Display.

What are the fair valuations of such 'companies', well (1) would be approx. 15-20 B considering all the recent auto companies that went public at that or near that price, especially considering $MVIS's tech is best in class. (2) is useful for all kinds of devices in the Internet of Things so I would guess approx. 3 B. (3) AR is targeted as *the* next-gen platform by Apple, Google, Facebook, and others, and chosen and proven in Hololens 2. So, that's approx. 10 B. Finally, (4) There are *hundreds of millions of Amazon Echo* and similar devices that have been sold so $MVIS would be a novel differentiator to this market. Again, approx. 3 B.

So the total for those that can't math = **31-36 B**. I *highly doubt* $MVIS will sell off their tech piecemeal as that would be a complicated and shitty endeavor to go through. So, perhaps, they throw it all together for 20-30 B in a one-shot deal.

For comparison, Luminar was valued at 10 B (\~$65/share) pre-NASDAQ correction. $MVIS' auto LiDAR is superior to Luminar so it stands to reason that fair market value for this *one* particular vertical should be 15-20 B. There are plenty of other speculations on fair valuation with different ranges but I believe these to be fair (and am open to being wrong if someone gathers better data).

What does this mean for you? Well, let us say hypothetically that the buyout valuation puts $MVIS at a very conservative 20 B, you would therefore be looking at approx. $150/share. I doubt we'll see a number that low with a T1 buyer, especially if it's Google looking to make a move on the market.

# But WHAT IF there is no buyout?

$MVIS is still an excellent company with best in class technology for what they do. They're rapidly growing and checking all the bullish boxes that I like to see in companies pre-lift off. It is precisely *this question* that keeps me humble with a more conservative PT of $90-$125. I believe without a buyout, the stock will get here regardless by EoY. I will adjust my PT based on this either/or outcome of buyout vs. non-buyout accordingly.

# Obligatory ""sHoRt iNtErEsT"" Section

I personally don't give a shit about short interest in this stock because I like the company and what it's doing regardless but in case that matters to you here:

Short Volume Ratio: 30% - [https://fintel.io/ss/us/mvis](https://fintel.io/ss/us/mvis)

% of Volume Shorted as of Mar. 25th: 67.39% - [https://www.nakedshortreport.com/company/MVIS](https://www.nakedshortreport.com/company/MVIS)

% of Shares Shorted: 12.64% - [https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/MVIS/short-interest/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/MVIS/short-interest/)

Summary Quote: [https://shortsqueeze.com/?symbol=MVIS&submit=Short+Quote](https://shortsqueeze.com/?symbol=MVIS&submit=Short+Quote)

# How to Play?

Shares are honestly a safe bet here with a very lucrative buyout possibility. Personally, I will be increasing my position as much as I can while it's under the $14.00 mark because I really like this stock. I'll be going long with my shares and taking gains if overbought.

Options are also fairly inexpensive with the downturn as well. Personally, I like the MAY 21 right now date but I'll be taking longer date contracts as I roll over profits and increase my position over time.

Closing Points/Sum:

* Good company with a long history that is making a huge turn around with its tech
* Better product than competitors in multiple fields that is scaleable
* Excellent growth since January with little signs of stopping by EoY
* Stands to benefit from Biden's 4 T infrastructure plan where 2 T is earmarked for climate initiatives, including a focus on building EV stations, bolstering the electric grid to prevent shit like what happened in Texas from happening again, and the re-introduction of the ""cash for clunkers"" policy wherein people could trade their shitty non environmentally friendly guzzlers for sleek, sexy new EV or hybrid vehicles
* Currently undervalued with its share price with the potential to either maintain explosive growth or blow out from a T1 giant buyout
* World-leading talent acquired on the board of directors and expanding their business by hiring loads of new staff which may indicate either further growth or a buyout in the future
* High-ish short interest (>1 day to cover and over 15% of float shorted)
* It is possible that the stock is falling due to portfolios being rebalanced away from tech by large players, but it is also possible we're seeing massive shorting from banks because of the end of their EZ money train come Mar. 31st. In either case, *nothing* has changed with the company and it's doing excellent work so this lends to the strength of opening a position between Monday-Wednesday

Edit: I thought of one possible negative that may impact pricing. The god damn boat clogging the canal will likely be disrupting already stressed-out supply lines even further for the next month. Obviously, this is negative for current holders but I see it as a further buying opportunity.

Positions Disclaimer:

Shares: 100 @ 13.33 (acquiring more when I get paid on the 30th praying to the God's it stays under 14.00-15.00 so I can load up)

Options: 14x 16c MAY 21 (again, adding loading up while the prices are good when I get paid)

Hopefully, I won't get downvoted to oblivion for my first DD. If it goes well, I'll look into making it a regular thing. I realize I likely am unable to fill in the gap of better posters but hey, I'm trying here.

Have a good weekend, folks.

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the FUCKING way
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"So which brokerage did you go for?

OP: *yes*"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Diversification is the key.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,What brokerage is page 4
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,What brokerages are 4 and  8?
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,After the RH fuckery I needed several back up plans
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,He diversified his stock across accounts.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôll only need one if I sell üíéüôåüöÄ
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"I recently learned that TDA receives a large portion of PFOF revenue. Webull receives less PFOF revenue than TDA. I‚Äôm likely going to exclusively use Webull and Fidelity after the squeeze. I really do like TDA and their UI though.

TL;DR- Webull for trading, Fidelity for long term holdings"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Ty! Easy to keep track when I don‚Äôt plan to sell anytime soon :)
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"As a dumb ape, I can say that I *feel* richer"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"As mentioned before, Webull for trading and Fidelity for long term holdings. Although TDA has been great, large PFOF% makes me want to leave"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,8 accounts seems excessive
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Talk to your tax guy before you sell.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Do you have any concerns with Webull fuckery during the squeeze?
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Agreed.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"good information, much appreciated"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I was experimenting to see which one I‚Äôd like the best üëÅüëÑüëÅ
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Sell? Idk what that is
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,wait what why
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm pretty sure they're good considering that it was their clearing firm who placed the restriction and then they went against their clearing firm to open up trading
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"And what's the verdict?

Edit: My smooth-brain didn't scroll down before asking the question. Already have the answer now, thanks."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Haha fair enough. Takes awhile to learn a given platform though, especially if you use the real trading platform - like ToS from TDA"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Can‚Äôt bury the stonk with you.  I mean you could, but that would be a waste"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I was just curious 95% of my GME is in Webull and was considering transferring out bc of what happened in January. I've had no other complaints with Webull but don't want my shares in limbo so I'm keeping them there. I haven't heard many people talk about Webull at all. Just RH and Fidelity transfers
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Diamonds are forever
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Short term and long term rates are different and also depend on your tax bracket.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,There are different tax rates for short term / long term. There are quarterly tax payments. There are wash sales. Things get more complicated when you have more than 2 nickels to rub together.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,If you dont sell you dont pay taxes. Simple. Diamond hands
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Short term is exactly the same as income tax so there's nothing confusing about it unless you're confused by regular income tax.

Long term is a better rate but are we here to hold stocks for that long? I sure ain't."
2021-03-27 04:49:01,wallstreetbets,Getting closer ... looking to pay off the mortgage from emergency account funds 
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"$350+ and long term capital gains should do it. Peace of mind, without using the other accounts for retirement, YOLO, hookers and bananas"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Congratulations; fuck you.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"That‚Äôs how it‚Äôs done! Congrats! I paid off my student loans trading years ago, and this past year yolo‚Äôd enough to buy the new home I closed on this week. Have to be the right combo of disciplined and retarded..."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I hate seeing people say payoff their mortgage. Refi to a 2% rate and reinvest your fucking money. 2%!
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Hey look at that I thought I was the only one on WellsTrade
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Would paying off the mortgage be the smart play? Assuming you've managed a decent interest rate, that money would be better spent in continued investment.. even a low risk play full of dividend stocks? Heck, you could probably swing your mortgage payments off divies!"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Unfuckingrealized!!!!   I‚Äôm sure this will end great
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Have you taken any profit? Or are you just sitting on 795% unrealized?
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Sell Mortimer sell!
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Paying off mortgages at these interest rates is truly a retard‚Äôs move
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,How long have you been holding this?
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Man I never get tired of good news on this sub. What a great place. I've lost a bunch of money here but I'm actually up and playing(losing) with house money now. I paid off all my debt and the money I've lost has been a great education. Got to take out $20k on a $550 buy in. Right place right time with GME. Well done my friend!
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Don‚Äôt forget the tax man
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,My favorite part is you are gambling using your emergency account lol.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Congrats man I myself is trying to turn a few hundred dollars into 100k which seems very obtainable within the next five weeks for me
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Literally don‚Äôt pay off your mortgage. Way better places for that üí∞
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"What the fuck is your strategy to do this? You must be really active trading; buying dips and selling peaks. No way this is one good yolo. 

Please share, elevate me from a chimp to an ape"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Pay off mortgage - let it ride ??
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol wellstrade
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,You have a mortgage? Lucky haha
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Good for you.

I recommended PYPL to a more money-conservative friend early 2020, around $90.

Was a sure thing at the time. Just not HOT enough for me personally."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"bruh if i were you , i would sell and wait for the share to go down, i am not much of a risk taker"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Good for you ‚Äî but FYI don‚Äôt payoff off your mortgage - use $$ you make from investments to pay it down all while leveraging your $$ 

Good luck"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Dam
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Wowza. When did you buy?
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Positions daddy?
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Congrats! This is the way.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don‚Äôt know about y‚Äôall, but I read pay off, mortgage, and emergency and got excited. Way to go!!"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,how long did you invest paypal until your profit goes 795.72%?
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,W H A T THE F U C K
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Congratulations!
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Congrats and fuck you.

But seriously, make sure you put aside enough to pay the taxes!"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I am launching a business with my gains. http://ThePlaneFrame.com
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Why bother paying off mortgage? The returning rate is way higher than the mortgage rate
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Love seeing things like this. 

Fuck you."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Don‚Äôt forget taxes
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you pull up a 1min chart, there is huge darkpool volume immediately after close like we've been seeing in GME/AMC."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I lost $50k on PayPal calls the other week. GME helped me bounce back from that BS
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"First Wells Fargo screenshot I see on here lol

Thought I was the only one"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Have you considered decorative gourd futures?
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Awe good for you Dick face MaGee!
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,my dumbass thought you had 115k in a paypal account. I think I belong here
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,You could buy another house and rent it out then that pays your mortgage (maybe) and you have an extra asset
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Congrats and fuck you! 

Despite being an ape I found myself at a company that IPO‚Äôd after a few years. Sold most of my shares last year and bought a house with the cash. For us, the peace of mind of owning our home mortgage-free was too enticing, even if it wasn‚Äôt technically the ‚Äúsmartest‚Äù play. I got absolutely wrecked by the housing crisis so maybe that weighed into our decision. If anything were to happen to me, my wife (and her bf) and our kids will have a home no matter what. 
Now I just need $GME to üöÄüåùand we‚Äôll really be good to go!"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice bro
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Im sure this has been said already all up and down this thread but im still gona send it. 
If you have made 800% returns, realize the power of your capital and do not waste it on erasing low interest debt. Youre growing that account into a meaningful sum of money. Continue to make it work for you! 
Sure i understand the positive  mental aspects of being debt free and it could factor into a greater financial strategic plan yada yada...  that money has a lot of potential value. If you can continue to make payments through regular income while continuing to invest this money, do that."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Dave Ramsey would proud!!!!
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm not really following this but I‚Äôm pretty sure the theme of this Reddit is to ‚Äúhold like the diamond handed apes you retards actually are‚Äù and I must admit this one seems fishy...
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,why would you pay off a 5% mortgage when you can make 795% in shares?
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Don‚Äôt be dumb. Your mortgage is the cheapest money you‚Äôll ever borrow. Keep investing and pay your mortgage‚Äôs minimum. You‚Äôll make more on what you invest than you‚Äôll lose in mortgage interest. 

You‚Äôll end up richer if you leave it invested and keep the mortgage."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wait. Inflation is expected in the next few years, don't slap down all your money against fixed interest rate loans. 

Man, y'all really are smooth brain af. This is why there is zero correlation between intelligence and wealth."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,So you gambled your emergency fund on GME? Your wife‚Äôs BF probably didn‚Äôt like that when he heard about it
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice but have you heard of a lucrative opportunity in Egyptian bunny breeding futures?
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Hookers and bananas...you‚Äôre my kind of retarded people.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"1% discipline, 99% retard"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,You are living my dream sir!
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Great fucking combination.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Good job! Let's get to the moon and pay off any loans.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yep, then use your home as a tax shelter"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Normally would agree, but I have other accounts and more shares;  it‚Äôs a paperwork shuffle"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wasn‚Äôt that what Stephen Graham said?

But what if you reinvest your money and your portfolio becomes negative?"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"If reinvest your money you mean buy spy or something yes. But if you mean reinvest in meme stocks, no. My brokerage acct topped out at 1M right after gme and bb went off the first time. Now 650. Wish I'd paid something off rather than reinvesting in meme stocks."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,were the fuck are you getting 2% from?
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Can you please throw a few more sentences on this bad boy?
  
Like I have 176k at 4.875%. How in the hell is reinvesting my gains better than paying off my largest source of debt? 
  
Like I get you. If I had 500k in my bank account I could do BOTH. But like I don't. So given the choice I'm paying off my fucking mortgage lol. Anything else sounds like Mcconaughey's monologue from WoWS."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck that. Paying off your mortgage is a great idea. How about no interest instead? Reinvest also... that is the way.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"95% of the time, your absolutely right."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"0% interest is better than 2% interest. This idea of keeping a mortgage when you can easily
Pay it off  is borderline actual retarded. Good work op"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Right?!?

Love hate relationship :/

Their 100 free trade a few years back made it impossible to move ‚Äî"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,There are dozens of us!
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yep, I recognized the boring, no frills  page."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Smartest? Maybe not...

Not a Max/min play‚Äî but it makes the bank folks stop using words like ‚Äúpersonal guarantee‚Äù for other things we‚Äôre talking about and helps cash flow, access to otherwise trapped equity

Im younger - love the house... but it‚Äôs a shoebox... want to be able to have it because my folks are close... but desperately want to move out of the area.  I‚Äôm still researching.

I think the rental income would more than pay the mortgage for a real house (I‚Äôm in one off the most expensive areas of the country) and if I sell ‚Äî I lose some local property tax relief and either buy at the top of the market, i‚Äôm out of an area I want access to for about 10 years."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"There's really not a wrong answer here, just two different approaches that both have pluses and minuses. To me, the early payoff makes more sense, one thing to consider is that now you free up your mortgage payment to be invested in the market every month, you'll have a consistent source of dry powder that way."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs the Joy of Jeffery ...
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sitting for now, it‚Äôs a single purpose account that kind of blew up since the pandemic."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"It was 300 once, I think around Feb.
  
Im waiting for the quarter earning call on May."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Absolutely.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"True ape here, please explain. TIA"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"came here to say this.

&#x200B;

 o7"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"If I did, it wouldn‚Äôt be a rate of return move; it would be a compliance / quality of lifemaneuver :)"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs a purpose account ‚Äî little dribs and drabs I‚Äôd piss away elsewhere got moved here.

Cook when tired instead of DoorDash? Pay myself -

Not so much a strategy ‚Äî lot of research ... some hustling for extra couple of bucks.

I lost my dad, and wanted to be better on somethings; but my other accounts ate the transactions so I couldn‚Äôt see progress. Segmented here with 100 free trades a year.

It‚Äôs basically a side project that blew up"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I think he just bought like 500 shares of PayPal 3.5 years ago and held.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,He probably bought PayPal when it was dirt cheap. Think as if you bought Tesla at IPO
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs a portion of my shares; so I‚Äôd totally cash out this account and ride the rest ...  if the taxes don‚Äôt kill me
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"I strongly think they‚Äôll do well after earnings ‚Äî the bar is low. 

The key metrics I watch are user engagement and strength of dollar; so much of their profit comes from cross border fees.

I think Melvin sold a while back"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs close to the plan :)
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Its cheaper to pay it off than what I‚Äôd need to put down to qualify for another (rev producing) asset purchase.

Plus ‚Äî I won‚Äôt sign their personal guarantee if you put a gun to my head"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,All in
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I dunno...those Sudanese Tea Cup Pig markets speak to me rn
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Say less. I'm in.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Sounds about right. The big money is made betting on things that have never occurred before.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,100% stonks
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Look at Mr. Conservative Value Investor over here with the diversification
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Share with me your tax shelter wisdom, I am but a humble dumb ape."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Fair enough
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"You‚Äôd just put it in something safer if it‚Äôs your mortgage fund, it‚Äôd still return 4-5% over time."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I have a 2.375% on a 30 year
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I was selling 1.875% 15 year fixes back in June 2020 through January 2021
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Refi'd for 2.215 15yr That is cheap interest and it will be paid off in 9 years.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,If you pay 2% interest and gain 4% return you net a 2% gain. You also get to write down the interest expense on the mortgage
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think the logic is you lose mortgage interest tax deduction and also that the percent gain potential of that sort of $$$ in liquid can far exceed the % interest you pay monthly. Im kinda in the same boat though like obviously I'm gonna pay off my house asap, but at the same time I don't think you'll see me doing any big balloon payments when my interest rate and mortgage are so low as is.

Also in your case why the hell did you not refi these past few months at 4.8 that's insanely high for nowadays"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Well the idea is that you can make more than a 4.875% return in the market. So it makes more sense to keep your money there growing at a faster rate than your debt.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'll simplify:  Let's say you owed $100k at 5%. In 1 year you now owe $105k.  So paying it off will save you $5k.  But, if you invested it, and made just 10%, you made $10k for the year."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Why didn‚Äôt you refinance with historic low rates in the past year?
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Don't listen to retards. Like fucking 95% of millionaires have their mortgages paid off - and paid before becoming millionaires. No interest is better than even 2%.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"You are thinking like a poor person.

Be smart about it and leverage yourself enough. That's how the rich stay rich, they got debt to their tits. Make that debt work for you."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"No its 60% of the time, it works everytime"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"As if anyone ever complained about their unrealized gains living in a paid off house... 

Some people are delusional on the peace-of-mind side of things. Good work man."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you can make 10% int investing that money versus only saving 5% paying off the mortgage, it's not retarded, it's good financial sense.  If you want to pay it off for peace of mind, go for it, but you're throwing money away doing that."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Right?? I would pay it off and use my ‚Äúmortgage‚Äù monthly spend on maxing out saving
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Wells gets a lot of shit and probably rightfully so but I think there‚Äôs a lot to like. I don‚Äôt plan on switching any time soon.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,How did you get a $100k mortgage in one of the most expensive areas? In Sydney and I thought we'd done pretty well with the first town house and making a couple of hundred $k of it but now have a $700k mortgage on the forever house. And we're not anywhere expensive by a long stretch.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,or refi and use RKT to do it
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Remember capital gain taxes.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Always prepare for a rainy day, don't have debt when the market crashes and you won't have foreclosure on your assets like it happened to me in 2008.

Being set back to 0, takes years to regain what you had."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Aka sell and realize that profit
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm rooting for you
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Can‚Äôt tell if you are retarded for not taking any profit or a fucking genius for letting it ride
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Same ‚Äî it‚Äôs a catch 22; I‚Äôll get slaughtered on taxes because the basis is low, which wouldn‚Äôt leave me enough to meet my goal

I do think they‚Äôll do  well ‚Äî they‚Äôre not a pandemic recovery play and are being tied too closely with Square...  the pandemic warped adoption forward a few years; they‚Äôre not even on Amazon"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Say it‚Äôs a 100k mortgage at 4% - if you have 100k of free capital and can guarantee that you would be able to out-earn the mortgage interest by investing the 100k instead of paying off your mortgage, then it makes more sense in the long run to invest it instead of pay off the mortgage. You also get to keep deducting the mortgage interest to lower your taxable income if you invest instead of pay off (but if interest rate is super low and/or the amount left on the mortgage is low, the deduction could be pretty minor). 
Now, what the interest rate % is where investing makes sense (over the life of a 15 or 30 year mortgage) is pretty subjective and depends on how good and safe you are at multiplying your bananas over time."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Paying off debt is freeing in a way, I paid of my car/student loans with my gains from the pandemic, the smart move was to reinvest it but being debt free feels good, and now my extra cash flow just goes back into the market"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Condolences about your dad but I suspect he‚Äôd be proud of your focus and success thus far.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I didn‚Äôt see the ticker name.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Or literally one year ago.(for Tesla)
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm still giving $10 handies - fuck
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,It's only cheaper if I has a variable interest rate. If dr. Burry is correct about some dramatic inflation happening within the next few years than borrowers win with fixed interest rates.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I have a beach front property on on the edge of a jungle in Idaho if you want to invest.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,YAS!! I'm invested in gourds!!!
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm about to invest in South Africa. $SAFU
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,How do I buy calls on losing my virginity?
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Sub-Saharan Africa is up next
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,[removed]
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,me too ‚Äî just bought a house and need tax shelter
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Payments against interest is tax deductible
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,congrats that is fuckimg goos. i got a 2.65% I knew i should have waited another month or two before refinancing. it was 4% so not bad in the long term of things.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,okay yea that makes since. i was thinking 30 years.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Well we are on WSB right? We need to be a little retarded to be here right?
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Gotcha! Thanks!
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I am not a smart man.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's silly. Your money should go where the yield is highest. If your interest is 2%, you should be paying the agreed monthly payment and any additional cash you have should be invested. Any smooth-brain ape can get better than 2% on investments."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is spoken like it came out of some credit fix seminar for people who can‚Äôt manage their credit or spending. 

You know what is better than paying 2% interest? Gaining 5% a year net when you invest your payments in an index."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Agree - The 2% is a bit oversimplification when you look at the compounding, where you are in the amortization, principal, and read the terms.

A paid house is an unencumbered asset, it gets viewed differently in calculations and  can be leveraged through more than just a mortgage, particularly if it generates profit.

I thing is I‚Äôm in no hurry ‚Äî that just the purpose of this account."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Now I just want a link to this 10% guaranteed return investment. :)
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Their PMAaccount is something special ‚Äî the threshold is attainable and unlocks some great tools that helped me learn so much
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Purchased a small near teardown in a great area, below market, private sale, rebuilt it myself, 20% down plus a good relationship with bank; refinanced about 5 times ‚Äî bi monthly payments, side hustle and balanced growing cash equivalents with paying down a bit extra principal... 

Absolutely made more on the refinancing than on the property as milestones were hit, appreciation is decent

Worked out to ~125k remaining on note; took 7 years"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"If the home was primary residence for over 5 years, taxes are irrelevant."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Very fair point.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Both.

It‚Äôs like throwing a dart and hitting the bullseye ‚Äî but I know these guys deeply. 

I like the stock ‚Äî and want to see earnings; 

Swapping it out to another company never made sense, because the core value never changed and I‚Äôd be in the dark with DD. I started digging into them when I saw Walmart started accepting them (weird, given they were owned by eBay at the time... but Walmart knows fintech)

Wish I knew options better, think they got a way to go and some stuff has been overlooked with all the frenzy with Voldemortcoin

They own e-commerce, well positioned in mobile ‚Äî cross border, risk, leadership are top tier.

Anyone else coming up has this as a headwind ‚Äî while they just have to bust into niches, push up usage rates, marketing and engagement to take a bite out of retail.

The data thrown off and being frenemies with the big 4 is incredibly unique... most players either aren‚Äôt big enough to matter or not trusted enough to share data that‚Äôs getting way more valuable....kicker is so much is organic because the world is switching anyway.

If their digital play is successful ‚Äî they‚Äôre the deafacto kingmaker by choosing what tokens are allowed access. That‚Äôs what first data did for years to print money, just more modern ‚Äî with data, risk tools, marketing and solid leadership thrown in."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Why not both?
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Also mortgage interest is tax-deductible in the US so you get to legally tell the Irs that they get less of your money.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is solid advice.

In my case ‚Äî paying it off is the cheaper, better option; because of what I want to do next and bank financing requirements clashing with my personal requirements.  

Banks just love it when you give them back their boiler point paperwork with some redlines ‚Äî but good ones will work with you if it‚Äôs reasonable."

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thats true, happened with my grandparents in the 70s, but I‚Äôm likely to turn it into a rental anyway. I pay off 150k to qualify for a bigger fixed loan at more favorable terms; and keep access to the area.

They may I think is I know I‚Äôm not going to be living here and and still will have leverage ‚Äî just with a lot less risk. I will not sign a Personal Guarantee, so I need to pay hard money to qualify...  I‚Äôm investing ‚Äî just not 100% in stocks

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Rates are still super low.. call your current mortgage provider and see what they can do. Sometimes that can cut out of lot of the fees/points and get you a lower rate compared to what‚Äôs available on the open market. If your current provider can‚Äôt do anything, I‚Äôd shop online and try to find a bank that will. Remember you can find a mortgage lender anywhere in the country (USA), as long as they‚Äôre willing to lend/underwrite you. My first loan was from a bank half way across the country, and the loan was sold within 2 weeks after closing."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Also what above poster is saying is that 2% is some real cheap debt. If you can make your money work better than 2%, it behooves you to do so and collect the profit rather than turning it over to the mortgage holder and having them profit on it."

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes ‚Äî PMA

If memory serves when all your products are at 25k (a portion of a mortgage counts) you get a basket of traditional accounts ‚Äî

*jerk off motions*

But you also get access to career bankers who are smart and will get to know you, talk and learn - you have to use it, but Jesus ‚Äî in my 20s - coming from a family that didn‚Äôt talk about money .. that was one of the first times I had enough knowledge to start asking questions

I‚Äôd recommend it for anyone ‚Äî it‚Äôs an important relationship, even if they are kind of powerless to do stuff at times.

It was different than my dads experience - when he came back from the service; bofA wouldn‚Äôt talk to him directly. He was 30 ‚Äî couple of kids, couple of tours, going to school at night - and had to bring his dad to the meeting ‚Äî the banker would only talk to his dad.

My dad kept that checking account til the day he died - solely to deposit everything and immediately sweep funds out to Wells and wait for bofa cold calls ‚Äî he had a script, would explain why he‚Äôd never give them a penny... he started a business and did really, really well for himself after that first mortgage.

That stuck with me ‚Äî you may have all the information in the world in your pocket; but that doesn‚Äôt help until you understand what your reading.

Also: Irish people can hold a grudge like they were coddling a newborn baby... and something about being told to Go fuck yourself in an Irish story, with a melodic brogue, hurts just a wee bit more"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Agreed; I reached out to an accountant for help; I‚Äôm both out of my element and kind of alone on this :)
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Maybe you should consider being single
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sure ‚Äî when you want to alter a document, and propose other terms - you cross them out (usually these are red) and add the changes

In my case ‚Äî the loan documents contain very draconian terms and conditions about what I‚Äôm responsible... which may never be triggered, and exist to protect the bank; mitigate their risk

Some are what they are

Others ‚Äî since I have consolidated with them and they can see everything ‚Äî can be mitigated in different ways and be removed.

Lawyers do this, but some are simpler

Example: 

I will not sign a personal guarantee. I‚Äôd rather the loan get declined and address the reasons why.

If I‚Äôm required to, I will move everything to a bank that doesn‚Äôt require it. It‚Äôs the fastest way to lose an good long term customer IMO, particularly when many are written to try and recover everything beyond liquidation value ‚Äî including projected profit - for the loan. 

especially on a debt already secured by a property ...so after some back and forth, their underwriters agree to remove it

Based on bank relationship, if you pledge a CD for 5 years for $xxxxx, etc

In my case ‚Äî for what I want to do ‚Äî I don‚Äôt need a PG and remove a liability by paying the property off ‚Äî everyone is happy. I can probably get a bigger loan If I rent it out and have a signed rental agreement.

Started because I redlined the clause, and was reasonable with my asks. Still some bad stuff in there ‚Äî but that‚Äôs part of the cost of capital and I hedge that risk with insurance, cash reserves or even an unused HELOC on property I own outright.

You can be amazing at finding an capitalizing opportunity, but if you hit a bump ‚Äî no one cares. They‚Äôll use the agreements to cover themselves 20 different way at your expense if you let them; but part of my responsibility when taking on the project is to mitigate the risk so it never happens.

I can both get super aggressive with some money and not winding up getting pegged with a banana  for the amount of tendies one would give a hobo at the first bump in the road ... by understanding my obligations - and the true cost of walking away"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"That‚Äôs the absolute distinction right there ‚Äî

Worse case is I rent this place, buy in a much cheaper area, and use the rental income and salary to add to my other accounts, pay that mortgage. I‚Äôd rather borrow more and have the risk consolidate with the new property acting as collateral than setup a potential cascade if those draconian terms were triggered.

Comes down to I I absolutely will not sign a personal guarantee or clauses that say I‚Äôm responsible for total loan value even if liquidation is less than projections;  they try hard to get around homestead protections here...there‚Äôs just too many ways that can blow up for the little bit of extra profit I stand to make"

I do find it amusing about all the talk of inflation is coming into focus AFTER houses cost twice as much, wages are stagnant and gas, heating, etc is up more than that.

2021-03-27 04:45:34,wallstreetbets,$FUBO Been fighting with this stock for a while. Tons and tons of average down. Took loss (because of margin calls) and got back again and again had to average down. Any suggestions of what to do would be appreciated ü§òüèª (Current plan is to HODL) 
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,i too have fubo loss porn
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have also been struggling with FUBO. There are some legit concerns about competition but they have carved out a nice niche for themselves and have been consistently growing revenue while bringing their costs down. They also have a huge catalyst in the works which is sports betting. FUBO could turn every living room into a casino sports book. 

With the very high short interest, I thought this could be a WSB target but it hasn‚Äôt gained any traction.  Hell, it‚Äôs market cap is only $2B (vs GME currently over $12B) so it wouldn‚Äôt take a whole lot to squeeze out the shorts. 

I‚Äôm not giving up. I think the market needs to go through its rotation and then come back. In the meantime, a larger streaming service could scoop up FUBO on the cheap. I‚Äôm holding shares and bought some ITM leaps yesterday afternoon when it dipped below 21."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Growth stocks should bounce early next week based on how the market closed today. FUBO was up almost 5% after hours so I could see it hitting 24 or 25 on Monday unless the last hour today was a fakeout. If it hits 25 sell the calls and either take the loss on your shares or sell the May 21 $30 for $3+ to lower your cost basis. If the calls finish in the money then your shares get called away for $30 when your cost basis is around $28 so the trade will be profitable. Don‚Äôt average in any more unless the price is low enough to make a significant difference in your average price. FUBO will likely be worth a lot in the future, but these kinds of stocks are not going to perform as well as reopening plays will in the near-term."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"# I love cable because of its structure but I hate paying 200$+. Fubo is the cheapest one for the channels I want and honestly it's amazing. It might have bugs because it's so brand new but ""buy the rumor, sell the news"" the point is to buy before it's like Hulu, Netflix.

They are the best at sports and they want to incorporate gambling.

YouTube Tv is good for normies, nothing I wanted to watch was there, on demand everything you have to pay for, got bored in a week.

Fubu it's pretty awesome.

IDK how long would the growth be.

I see it growing 400%+ ($80) by December 2021/2022"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,The real time interactive betting with live sports will be the critical path for it to moon. Hopefully they execute this well and take this to the next level. I'm long on this as well.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"To be honest (I really don't want to throw apeshit on your parade) literally nobody I've ever talked to even knows what Fubu TV is. 

Seems like the boomer attempt at competition for Netflix and Hulu. 

You really gonna pay for a cable/intetnet/phone package PLUS use another service just to stream CNBC or March Madness? Mom has Tivo.

It's way overvalued imo. Fubo wants fucking $65/month for what my cable company offers for $30/month.

I would see if you can hit breakeven, or even close, then move it all to something undervalued or at least that's useful or gaining popularity."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hold that shit, FUBO is a falling wedge of emotion.

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Take your Loss, when it's still reasonable. Then watch. And go in with small number of 3 months out calls. Then average down on those, if you were wrong. It'd cost you less than shares. And may yield back your loss quicker. 
You can also loose everything quicker. So be careful."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"I own an AV integration company we help people cord cut, and I will tell you it‚Äôs way overvalued and though I tell clients about it nearly all go with YouTube tv.

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,FUBAR TV
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean they offer like 80 channels for $70 a month, might as well get YouTube TV with all sports , news , free movies no add videos , 100 channels. Just a bad business model"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Thinking about buying some calls on Fubo. It‚Äôs really undervalued at 22.65.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"No you don‚Äôt pay for cable and get fubo. For some it‚Äôs  one or the other.   It competes with Sling, AT&T TV Now, Philo, and others.  Probably some people haven‚Äôt heard of those either.  Yes you can get an antenna to watch the networks (I do) but not everyone can.  Your cable company sounds great if they charge $30 including fees taxes, local distribution charge, hardware rental and so on to get all the same channels."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,What is value? How can you or I really put a value on this shit?
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"I dislike Fubo, they lock quality content (Live SPORTS) behind yet another streaming service paywall. If you ask me, i think the market is overcrowded. Imagine paying $8.99-$25.99 a month per channel on TV? Fuck THAT. Not every network can have one, that leaves even less room for companies without their own content (why netflix spent billions on their own content)

The deals these networks make with sports leagues are sometimes DECADES long.

Personally, I‚Äôm a ‚Äúcord cutter‚Äù and watching live sports is a bitch, but in the end, I get most of what I want to see. I won‚Äôt be picking up a Fubo subscription unless there was no other way.

Edit: here may be a negative catalyst for FUBO

‚ÄúNFL finalizes new 11-year media rights deal, Amazon gets exclusive Thursday Night rights. The new agreement runs through 2033 and will feature two Super Bowls returning to Disney's ABC network channel. Amazon is paying about $1 billion per year, according to people familiar with the matter‚Äù

Motley Fool really tries to tell you this is good for Fubo, but i disagree.

TNF won‚Äôt break them, but there‚Äôs not a ton of these deals available to be made."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,You‚Äôre not worth a shit unless you‚Äôre getting sued.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah like YouTubeTV, Hulu live, etc are all $65 a month too. Definitely a big market there"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Same for me. I‚Äôm a cord cutter who does like sports and it‚Äôs a pain in the dick to watch games I want to see. I almost sprung for a subscription to fubo but it‚Äôs pretty expensive. When I add the cost of my other streaming services I would be paying almost as much for cable.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,And Melvin took that personally
2021-03-27 04:34:15,wallstreetbets,"Could ASO short sellers be in a predicament Tuesday?  

A little background to begin. ASO IPO‚Äôd in October, it‚Äôs trading roughly  100% higher than ipo price. Myself and others have made posts about the  business and it being a solid play. It‚Äôs a strong company and Er the 30th (Tuesday) , one day before ipo lockup ends. I‚Äôm confident it will do well,  and see it being \~$30 by summer no matter what barring a market crash.  However I do have a question before I get to my main point:

My  question is this. Specifically in regard to ipo lockup shares. Can  they be lent out for shorting during the lockup period? I‚Äôve searched  and can‚Äôt find an answer there. It is not exactly important to my next point, but I just actually want to know.

ASO is  70% owned by tutes, and by outstanding shares is  shorted 15% so not overly  interesting in the post covid crash era. 48% of the float is short by  the latest numbers though. This kind of leads me to believe that the lockup shares can't be lent, but again, largely unimportant.

The really interesting point to be made is this; assuming they do blow er out of the water (very good chance, er estimates were revised slightly up because they doubled expectation last time) we know for certain what range the shorts were opened in. It hit ATH of $28 about 2 weeks ago, so there's some there, however at the time it hit that it already had high 30's % of the float shorted. AKA it hits 29 and every  short is losing, 100% guaranteed. 

So with our er beat assumption and upward price movement, there is an interesting dilemma for the shorts, the IPO shares are locked up until the 31. THEY CANNOT BE SOLD. As far as short covering is concerned they don't exist until the 31.

And before the  comments come in, yes I know how squeezes actually work, I know not everything is a squeeze, I know this can potentially not happen, I‚Äôm not in it for that alone, it‚Äôs a bonus. I‚Äôm  already sold on the business and the strong fundamentals. I‚Äôm more  curious what other not absolutely retarded folk think (more importantly  know) about the ipo share lend availability and if it actually acts a detriment  to a potential squeeze happening because of the lockup shares, or if its throwing gas on the fire. Either  way I‚Äôm expecting a solid er and a nice little run, if for no other  reason for the ipo buyers to make maximum tendies."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Stop thinking everything is a short squeeze, they are extremely rare.

That said, this ticker could have a mother of a gamma squeeze. The April 25c & 30c have more call shares than the average daily trading volume for the stock.  I can't be sure because I don't know how many shares were locked up and how many will be released."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nope been bagholding calls that lost 80% pf their value expiring in April. Fuck the DD and ASO, your intentions were good but ASO is dogshit and led us astray"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I exited this position in February. Took my small gain on $25 calls and got the fuck out. Stock just never sqouze or went anywhere and volume is trash. I doubt it‚Äôll Do anything Tuesday. But then again who knows
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Jacked to the tits on calls. 

Earnings scheduled right before lockup, plus huge short interest and open interest in calls. Seems way too predictable that this thing is going to moon, makes me a little concerned.

 Like why is the short interest so high? I suppose I wondered the same thing about RKT's unreasonably high short interest a month ago, but that paid off well anyways"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeh buddy :)
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"See what happens when the lockup expires and insiders are able to cash out with the stock up over 100% from IPO price.

If I was an insider, I would definitely take some holdings off the table.  Been a long time coming for most folks to be rewarded.  

I'm betting that they will sell."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Sorry dude. My mom works there and hearing about the shit ton of ammo that crazy Trump lovers were buying perked my ear but I sold that shit this morning.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sounds like a better short than a long, large institutional holding, large short interest and tons of shares coming out of lockup sounds like a bad day for longs."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Squeezes need a catalyst. A stellar er could be that. It‚Äôs obviously not a guarantee, but I also don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs sheer coincidence that the Er date was moved from April to the day before lockup expiry either."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm thinking about some puts on ASO actually. Share lockup ends the day after earnings.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"I expect Wednesday will be bloody as fuck from the insiders selling. But Monday, and especially Tuesday when the ER is dropped could get very interesting. Or it just trades flat and fucks everyone."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well we‚Äôll see. Either way I‚Äôll be watching from
The sidelines"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"If it does squeezes, that‚Äôll be a good idea cause there‚Äôs no way it‚Äôll Hold the price it goes to."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm salty with myself on this stock. Grabbed some $30c back in late February and watch em bleed and bleed. One thing I overlooked when looking at this stock is volume. Seems like one sale drops this stock $.50
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Me too! It was was so annoying. Delta and IV was so high yet the volume is ass. All the DD in the world can‚Äôt get that stock jumping.

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Damn lost over $300k ?? You ok man?
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Well if it gets to 35 in the next couple weeks you might recoup ... sweating for u tho
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"If it makes you feel any better, I'm bullish on QQQ. It still hasn't recovered from its correction and it's lagging behind SPY. I speculate QQQ is gonna increase faster than SPY and slowly close that gap. Will it happen before your expiry? Not so sure... Really unlucky timing for sure"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I know someone at work who somehow lost 1.5 Million on SPY calls that were LEAPs. How he managed to do that I dont know
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Dont worry I know a few people who can cast some magical spells.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes I have. Very well most days. Not so much the previous three weeks
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Yup. Still up 9x what I put into the market
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,My issue is the valuation on some of the companies in QQQ. Thats why I went for QQQJ
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Jesus Christ did they buy them in February 2020 and sell them mid March?
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Hey I‚Äôm rooting for you
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Maybe i'm not certain. Although that would be one of doing it.

Literally buys contracts like:

GME 800C, 950C, 5P

SPY 195P, 100P (alien invasion + WW3 + global pandemic + ?? all at once ???)

etc.

Very smooth brained. You made hundreds of thousands? Throw it out immediately.

OP here has a 'bit more' wrinkles than this youtuber. But at about same tier of smoothness."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ha I wish. Its a NYC Government Job. I make 15.45/hr plus benefits and seasonal OT. The guy who lost $1.5 Million on SPY calls previously worked (in no particular order) oil and gas, finance, economics, education and somewhere else."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Can you explain what he was doing. Too many crayons on the screen.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"He is making his money go to zero like you. Except his calls and puts are absolutely unrealistic. I assume the money is from first GME squeeze and the 'first time' to options. Buying cheap lottery ticket options is best way to lose everything when you made 6 figures.

If GME doesn't go $800+/950+ or at a ridiculously high increase upwards rapidly, then he basically loses everything he put money in.

As for his SPY puts, those are just free money losses. The financial crisis of 2008 took almost 2 years for the stock to go down \~55%. He needs the stock market to go down 80+% in 2\~3 months. He literally needs alien shooting lasers along with a WW3. Basically, he needs a situation in which money is meaningless anymore as the US as we know might cease to exist.

As for his AMC puts, might as throw money down the drain.

Basically, he bought items that will empty his winnings. Just like you (except you 'might' have a chance of say < 3% to gain instead of lose all unlike him who has basically 0%).

Very smooth brained. Buying cheap calls/puts without understanding a thing about them. The 'DD' you are going by still doesn't even make sense with your calls in first place. $35C yes. $40C? Hope you best of luck smooth brain. If you lose it all, there's always a next time. Easy money come and easy money go. Irony is $412k (even after taxes) on long term CAVG 10% return is still more than your annual income. You just threw that down the drain cause you don't understand how calls work. Generally, I don't care but for someone making \~$15, that's life changing money. Anyways, the one major play for you to make money is QQQJ goes up so fast that the options price a premium for the volatility (and you sell long before the calls expire). Otherwise, thank you for your service in the stock market (I guess this is exponentially more realistic than the Youtube guy who expects like 80% drop in the entire stock market).

On the flip side, maybe you won a lot more from GME first squeeze so this isn't much money. In that case, ehh. I guess congrats regardless."

2021-03-27 03:17:11,wallstreetbets,"DD: Part 2 I counted all the Wallstreetbets GME yolos, gains and loss porn Hi Everyone, If you missed my [first post ](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mdex64/dd_i_counted_all_the_wallstreetbets_gme_yolos/) I spent a stupid amount of time manually counting wsb yolos.  Since I already wasted a ton of time I decided I would waste some more and count the gme gain and loss porn posts (that hadn't closed their position) as well as new yolos from today.  A few posters were upset at me collecting positions but my logic is this is knowledge that is likely available to and collected by the short side and thus it is good for everyone here to have the same transparency.

&#x200B;

A few things have become obvious from this process 1) Is this is by no means a holistic accounting of these posts. It has become clear to me I am missing a lot. It was pointed out that our admin team purges any yolo below 25k as well users potentially purging their own posts or me just missing them. So this isn't meant to be all encompassing just an interesting insight.

&#x200B;

I kept the same slightly unrealistic assumption of 100% of posters having diamond hands. Interestingly of the de duped data only 1 user decreased their position while all the others either kept the same positions or increased it often literally doubling down.

&#x200B;

I included users who shared their position in my original post to validate my silent whale theory. (These positions arn't confirmed with a screenshot and I don't 100% trust all of them but oh well.)

**The Data:**

Since yesterday I was able to collect an additional 106 positions holding 87,754 shares with a mean holding of 731 shares. This bringing the total number of positions collected to 261 holding 339,958 shares. If we believe the available float is 27M this means only 261 kongs hold 1.25% of all float. Again this isn't all encompassing and doesn't even start to account for the potential millions of other apes holding gme. In my last post I postulated about the [rule of 1%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_%28Internet_culture%29) on the internet and I personally believe this applies in the case of these yolos and reddit in general. This in my opinion account for a legion of silent Kongs and whales. Just for fun if we apply the 1:9:90 ratio for content creator, upvoter and viewer. We can make a some what irresponsible estimate

At 1:9  2,349  WSB Kongs hold 3,059,622 shares

&#x200B;

At 1:90  23,490 WSB Kongs hold 30,596,220 shares.

&#x200B;

Again just estimates but this isn't even accounting for god knows how many of the 9.5m WSB apes who hold 1-10 shares or close connections of these apes who arn't even on WSB. No way of knowing for sure but I personally believe retail owns very close to all the float or all of it.  If people want the data I pulled anonymized to run further analysis I can share it.

TDLR: 261 kongs hold 339,958 share or 1.25% of all float *Gamestops site lists float as 54m so with that number these 261 Kongs own 0.627% of float. 

Edit: Was pointed out gamestops site lists Float as 54.2M and the other numbers of float 45m, 27m, 19m are likely inaccurate. So updating above."

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Ive never posted my actual numbers but i have an amount of shares over your average ape holding. There are a lot of silent holders not willing to publicly state how much they hold.

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"In all seriousness I'm thinking that it would be a good idea to potentially setup a public poll for this. To be remotely accurate, we'd have to require some form of proof for submissions. It would of course be expected to see some % of any submissions being fake, or those who have bought and then sold, but overall this could help to get a better picture of what OP is talking about here - WSB-Specific GME/AMC ownership."

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,He‚Äôs definitely here
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"There are currently about 50 million GME shares available for public trading, and at least 10 million shares shorted. As you probably know shorting means that an investor borrowed a share from someone and has to give it back eventually. There are several mechanisms that could force those investors to cover and close out their short positions, and if that happens they'll have to buy off the market at whatever the current price is. If the shares they need to buy are held by investors that just want to make a quick buck they can just buy and be done with it. They'll take a beating but then it's over. But apes aren't normal investors, they're in it for the squeeze. They can't force you to sell so if they try to buy and nobody's selling all they can do is offer more and more money until someone cracks. The more apes there are holding for the moon the higher that number goes.

This is very simplified but more or less the idea. More apes holding more of the available float makes a squeeze more likely, and makes it likely the squeeze will be huge when it finally happens."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"So my bad I should have had a couple different levels of estimated tradable float. I think the conservative float number is 45m (https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics/) But I have seen estimates and DD where if you include certain institutions, and other long players you can get to 19m or 27m float. I don't really know for sure what is true but I should of provided the 45m number as a comparison. I did yesterday doing the same calculation in the comments of the last post so my bad. At 45m 261 Kongs control .75% of the float."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"I haven't advocated people post their position I just collected when people did since this already is public info. I could be wrong but personally I think the not posting positions thing is kind of misguided. It seems a company like citadel that literally handles tons of order flow probably has more insight about how much retail actually owns, what % is buying and selling and at what brokerages than anyone. Now I could be wrong or just misunderstanding the argument but I personally think it actually should be encouraged to post positions as a lot of success depends on sentiment  and if you have 100s or 1000s of people posting their buys a day it probably helps morale/sentiment."

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok theoretically sure it's possible. But what is to stop GameStop from excerxising their ATM offering when it hits 1000, or 10,000?

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm both jealous and impressed
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"So if institutions owns 54¬†070¬†814 shares and mutual funds owns 18¬†084¬†894 shares. Total shares owned 72 155 708 and these are just top 10 holders. (napkin calculation)

GME 

- Shares outstanding (all classes) 69.94 (nice) 

- Float 54.17

- institutional and fund ownership (biggest ones) 72.15

And then you should count retail and smaller holders. 

So what's the real float if top institutions owns more shares that there ever is issued? 

I'm just retard and trying to understand what we are talking about. 

**GameStops own website**



https://news.gamestop.com/stock-information/institutional-ownership"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,So I was basing the 19m or 27 mill on the link someone shared below http://imgur.com/a/JQi40B6 I am not smart enough to know if that is actually accurate. Also I get that is what Gamestops site is reporting but why does yahoo report it as 45m?

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"That‚Äôs double counting the institutions and mutual funds. Ie, Fidelity total owned 9M shares, Series Intrinsic Opps was 6.8M of that. And Fidelity has sold. 
Honestly everyone really really really needs to stop using 12/31 filings to estimate holdings now. That was a lifetime ago in GME. Senvest is on there and we know they sold too."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Because Yahoo is wrong. Unfortunately for retail investors a lot of these websites have inaccurate information especially on float, which changes when insiders buy and sell. Morningstar has 27.7M shares as the float which is completely wrong and that‚Äôs why that FINRA Morningstar site always had the wrong short %. 
If you want to know real shares out and float you have to check co website and read through filings."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Haha I wouldn‚Äôt volunteer for a fire ant bite though. They‚Äôll still piss you off.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the hero.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,They just don't understand the fact you'll be a millionaire soon
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"What is counted twice in their website? Or are institution and mutual funds same thing? For my understanding Fidelity Management & Research Company LLC and Fidelity Series Intrinsic Opportunities Fund are same same but different different company. 

Btw fidelity didn't sell they just [transferred](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/315066/000031506621001050/filing.txt) those shares between institution and mutual funds. For my understanding. 

And I'm using same info and websites as you are for pointing that float.

I'm not arguing I'm trying to learn."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"All right fair enough. Either way I think my point stands that 261 reddit users hold a pretty sizeable number of shares at current market value worth $61,532,398. I personally think for every visible whale like this there is an equal or multiple number of silent whales. This doesn't account for the very large number of small holders. So even if retail don't own the float it could be the anchor for other long players or institutions that could collectively. Out of curiosity and it is somewhat unknowable but do you have a personal guess for how many shares retail owns?"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Might want to make that billionaire
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"So you can‚Äôt add the institutions and mutual funds together it‚Äôs double counting. Ie, Fidelity owns 10M shares. Fidelity SI owns 7M shares. Fidelity low cost fund owns 3M shares. Fidelity owns a total of 10M shares, not 20M.
And Fidelity definitely sold, the transfer thing is not accurate. This is *not a bad thing* for people who own GME although everyone gets very mad when I tell them Fido sold.

You *want* price sensitive holders to have already sold. A fundamental investor will sell when the stock spikes. We know this. They already did! The more shares in passive funds the more volatile and easy to squeeze a stock is because you don‚Äôt have fundamental investors that buy low and sell high acting as volatility dampeners."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,No I really have no idea.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"So what do you think about this? 

http://imgur.com/a/JQi40B6

Edit.

Yep it's 2020 info"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"So into  institution ownership there is already counted mutual owned shares?

By transferring shares they'll have to buy them from themselves. So is fidelity still owning same amount of shares even though one of them ""sold"" them? Or is institution ownership now 0, even if you count both of Fidelitys?

If you can't count on their own websites, where do you get right data?"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"I can‚Äôt read all the small print but saying the ‚Äúfloat shouldn‚Äôt include mutual funds who are unable to short‚Äù is wrong. Mutual funds lend their shares to short its  a source of income for them. The more shares held in mutual funds and ETFs the more shares will be available to borrow generally. 

The float rightfully excludes a Ryan Cohen and other insiders. But for example, Don Foss had 3.5M shares that he sold (he filed) which added 3.5M shares back to the float (went from 50.5 to 54M)"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"There is no ‚Äúaccurate‚Äù information. Filings come out 45 days after quarter end so they are always lagged. You can read through SEC filings which give some insight when there‚Äôs large holders that sell. So from the filings we know Fidelity completely sold but it won‚Äôt be reflected in a 13f until May 15th.

And yes the institutional ownership includes the mutual fund shares."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Appreciate your answers.

I just want to make sure but it's still unsure did they sold their stocks completely or ""transferred"" them?"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sold. Again, this is not a bad thing for people hoping for a short or gamma squeeze"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Okay, thanks for the education üôè I'm not personally so interested have they sold or not, it's just hard to swim through all the shit posting so I'm just more interested what's actually happening"

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,DD don't mean shit for short term it's only a certain on a long time scale there's no telling what GME will do week to week it's gonna moon but it's gonna do a lot of bullshit before it gets there
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I love Double Dragon. Jimmy and Bimmy Lee.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Current Price is somewhere along the bid-ask range of the options contracts, the Avg Cost is how much the options contracts cost the OP for the option to buy (I believe) each share in each contract. The Amount number means he‚Äôs bought +11 contracts, which represents 1,100 shares (i.e. 1 contract represents the right to buy 100 shares of the underlying stock). The Return amounts are the Current Price ($19.43x1,100=$21,373) minus the Avg Cost ($32.57x1,100=$35,827) = -$14,454 (guessing the $2 difference is rounding from the Avg Cost? Not totally sure how options are displayed in Robinhood). And as you can see from the Current Price portion of the Return calculation, the Equity number is the Current Price multiplied by the shares the contracts represent.

Exp Date is the biggest problem here because that‚Äôs when the contracts expire worthless. Unless the underlying stock price goes up, there‚Äôs a guaranteed loss of up to the purchase price of the options and the closer you get to the expiration date without the underlying stock price going up, there are going to be fewer and fewer people willing to buy the contracts at all and even if there are buyers, the Current Price is going to drop lower and lower.

Edit: FWIW, I‚Äôm still learning options myself, so there may be some flaws in some of the assumptions I‚Äôve made above."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,What‚Äôs the ticker for Amirite? I‚Äôm going all in on Monday! Thanks for sharing!

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,You probably gonna do the same thing next week right?
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Get back in on the DISCA puts
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,you think DISCA is still gonna keep going down next week? i think i want to hop on a put there. made some money off VIAC today and still have a $45 put too

SILVER SPRING, Md., March 26, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Discovery (Nasdaq: DISCA, DISCB, DISCK) today announced that today's trading activity is not the result of insider transactions or transactions by Advance/Newhouse Programming Partnership or its affiliates. The Company issued its outlook for the first quarter of 2021 on February 22, 2021 and provided additional guidance at the Deutsche Bank TMT Conference on March 8, 2021, and is comfortable reaffirming its outlook and the additional guidance. The Company is confident in and pleased with the execution of its strategy, both with respect to its traditional business and the direct to consumer roll out. It looks forward to releasing first-quarter results and hosting its quarterly investor call on May 10, 2021."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I'd be careful with VIAC and DISCA puts next week. They're about in analyst PTs currently and may rebound a bit on speculation of streaming strength. VIAC tanked due to their horrendous share offering which diluted shareholders hard - dumb af but they got bills to pay
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôd be careful. Only reason I still have viac puts is because I have no more day trades left. Both ended down about 27% in a day, so I would expect it to rebound some on Monday or early week."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have that same problem. Here's my strategy. 

*Buys calls*

This is sure to go up! 

*Goes down 7%* 

Okaaay ummm I guess I'll buy another. This is a great price. It's gotta go up. 

*Shares drop another 9%*

*Panic sell for a cool 75% loss*

*Stock immediately starts rebounding*

*Get FOMO*

*Buy back in on calls at the peak*

*Stock immediately drops again*"

It seemed like a great plan until somehow his drunken brain was able to rattle off all 16 numbers of the credit card, expiration date and security code to allow the transaction.

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yea looked into them. I like what they do and the problem they solve is cool.

But they do rely a lot on the sales team. And at the revenue they are doing, along with the competition they will always have, profitability needs to be more of a priority. They just keep diluting existing shareholders. Not a good look. The spending should not be so high. I don‚Äôt see them hitting billions in revenue in the near term. Maybe in ten years. Being unprofitable for an additional ten years should not be considered an option. Somebody will make a way better product by then."

Sorry, I am on my phone.

I do have a real investing account. I got into gamestop on the 2nd dip at 5 shares average $47. I also bought a little AMC. I bought in so I could initially invest $350 seed money and grow it quickly. Then I would learn how to properly research and DD.

That is all the experience I have. I am looking forward to learning about investing. I just didn't know where to start until I saw this post.

Not sure if I qualify because I started trading a small account last July, put 60$ into it just to see what would happen, never looked at it too much. Got into GME, and have been paying my dues since then, learning more about technical analysis and trying to learn the options chain. I even see myself day trading as a possible career or side hustle one day. So this would be a good learning opportunity. (If I don‚Äôt blow it up on TSLA calls)

New to trading since February 8th! I got peer preasured into Opening a Roth and I'm already down $1k out of my $7k with $500 in realized loss. Everytime I sell I lose money. I bought some CRSR at the peak and they bought out company and have been sliding downhill since. Why have a CD when I can have a lot of AM for the dividend.

I come from a financially uneducated background and haven been trying to pick a few things up over the last two years. Yet it has been all self-occuried and insufficient to truely achieve anything.

Having a mentor I could bombard with questions and being shown real investment with my own little atack in the game, tagging along and debating what to do when would be the real game changer for me.

So, I lovr the concept of paying forwars, which cannot really be applied here. However, I intend to give back by mentoring another ape youngster if I ever have enough knowledge myself. 

So this ape-ian culture flourishes for as long as possible!

Thanks for coming to my TED Talk where I educated about nothing of substance so far. I intend to make the second one a bomb. So education here I come."

Background: I am brand new to trading. I got lucky and caught wind of gamestop mid January and bought 36 shares at roughly $40 per. My initial went from less than 2k to just under 20k In about a week or two. I was absolutely mind blown. I felt invincible. I was borderline obsessed. I would get up early to keep tabs on the share price(I live on the east coast-USA) I remember seeing $500 at one point. I thought it would not stop. (Can't stop, won't stop, GameStop) but... I ended up paper handing and selling for a meslly 3k profit. In short,, I Wish I was till holding!! I'm not quite sure what this""contest"" is about( I'm drunk) but I wanna be a part of it.

I've started trading in early februari of 2021. So I'm very very new to this.

Currently I'm trading based on others suggestions and applying my own common sense to them. So I read why people are bullish on a certain stock. Check if I understand why they are. Find more people who think this as well and lastly find people with the opposite opinion, so I don't get stuck in a confirmation bias (as nice as that is).

Hoping to learn a lot from this. My goal is to be able to analyse and find stocks on my own. I'm currently studying and want to become a data analyst. So I'm eager to start analysing some stock data!

 background on yourself :

former military, disabled. went into the oilfield, broke my back, more disabled.  Son of a boomer(forgive me), redhead(forgive me again)

looking at how the economy is so twisted, so manipulated and then looking at how wages have been stagnate for so many years, I see an end game to everything forming.  Inflation is hard to hide at this point and picking up speed.  I need a way to make money faster than it gets devalued.  GME opened up the possibilities of this to me.  Started (attempting) to day trade cryptos back in Feb. 

Im pretty good at seeing patterns or things that are 'off'.  Hoping that plays positively into the trading world.

Too broken to go back to work.  The world doesnt pay but enough to survive, and I want to thrive.

So doesn't have to be massive gains.  


I mostly buy stocks on top, forgets about them, and they seem to never get back to top or higher.  


I found my meme stock after lurking WSB - you all eat crayons, so I search for Crayons, so I could sell you some dinner - Found Crayon Gruop (tech/IT) - turns out they have one product and I bought the top, so now I'm waiting for it to go burst :D"

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,This sounds really cool .. we should have a live trading tournament at an abandoned AMC. Something like a live E-Sports tourny but for trading. We could sell tickets and F&B to the 9million WSB'rs to watch and then sell all of their data to other companies. Then take all that and put it in GME --> profit

Right now my strategy has been yoloing all of my money into otc stocks and losing and gaining shitloads from day to day... Up about 25% since this September when I started trading big amounts, down 40% from my February all time high. Got about 80% of my portfolio and loan money in a single stock right now so I definitely belong here. 

Too jaded and young to give a shit if I go broke, not like it's gonna put me on the streets. Short term goal is to either get enough for a downpayment on a house, and if it doesn't work out I'll have a degree and hopefully a job soon enough. Truly believe my stock is a multi bagger and when it hits the Nasdaq I'll do a huge DD on it. 

Long term goals I actually want to learn how to trade in case my yolo pays off and I have enough money that can't be a moron anymore. Hopefully I can learn a thing or two from you apes."

Background: Started investing late 2019 and have loved every minute of it. Originally began on the M1-app, totally passive style, then once I became more informed I switched to Fidelity during summer 2020. Since then my interest in aggressive portfolio growth has skyrocketed. Around the same time I discovered WSB and developed an affinity for crayons and impressive investment research. ‚ù§Ô∏è this community!
Goals: Practice and develop active trading skills + strategies. I would like to advance beyond buying-and-holding, and turn wait-and-see into weekly tendie-quests.

Newly joined ape. 

I got into trading at the very end of January. Bought AMC at 13.75. Tried one day to sell it at a loss and pick up more while price was going down. Only to find out I had to wait for the trade to finalize to buy more. Lmao. I've been buying GME since. Waiting for my tendies and buying what I can.  

I've been trying to learn more and more about the market and whats going on and I'm really enjoying it. But coming from no experience it's a lot. 
That being said, I can't wait to learn more and see what the future brings!!!"

I‚Äôd been curious about trading for a while but I was hesitant to give it a go Until GME. Ever since then I‚Äôve been obsessed with learning all that I can about trading. I‚Äôm only 19 so I‚Äôm hoping I can soak up as much knowledge as I can and give myself a head start in saving for my first home. I‚Äôve made a few hundred bucks already from some lucky trades but I‚Äôm hoping I can improve on my technical and fundamental analysis skills to become better at choosing my investments.

Super excited to be a part of this, Godspeed my fellow ape bois."

I was riding along with you all on the roller coaster, but I didn‚Äôt have any real skin in the game until the 2nd run up, got it at $204... but got AMC @ $10.

What paper trading platforms are the best ? I assume date and stuff come via message. I have an Ameritrade (with a tiny bit of GME and HOFV) and cant get the frigging thinkorswim program to work. My strategy previously was to throw a tiny bit of money into bitcoin via cash app.

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Add me, bental

I'm 31, I'm Australian and only started investing my money this year.
I'm in the army, body is pretty messed up, I'm hoping to learn how to get my meager savings to work for me. I want to give my partner a good life and set myself up for some kids in the coming years.
Late last year, I started on a tip from a friend and grew $5k (dollarydoos) into $7. I've also gained roughly 10% on another 5K I started with, despite buying a few GME shares at 300usd (averaged down to 200 so far).

I've already learnt a lot from some of the people on here, I love the community. Thanks!"

I think my last comment was modded.out. I said a verboten word. 

What paper trading platforms are the best ? I have an account with Ameritrade (with a tiny bit of GME and HOFV) and cant get the frigging thinkorswim program to work. My strategy previously was to throw a tiny bit of money into a digital currency via cash app. I have a share of GME there too but I don't think it's real. In the same fasion that the ppl with RH don't have true shares. But I'm kinda retarded.

Been on RH for about 2 years. Never playing with much, about a grand.

When we have extra money, my wife gets a tattoo, I put my extra in my RH, that's about it.

Steadily lost about $100 each year riding ups and downs, chasing penny stocks. Not bad for learning curves, no yolo attempts until GME.

I have 3.96 share of GME and a fractional of Tesla.
GME has brought my ALL screen green (well, some days lol). Closed all other pos to buy GME dips.

I want to learn more so I can bring in a little extra, go on a vacation, pay off my car or send my kid to college.

Right now I am still learning and soaking it all in. Looking at past trends, reading news and stock books. 
My goal is to provide a better life for me and my two girls. I have been a single father raising them on my own for ten years and the only thing we lack is a little ‚ÄúFU‚Äù money if you know what I mean?

I've dabbled in robinhood the last few years. I'm newish, still learning. When the market dropped last year I bought up some penny stocks. My best buy was NIO at a few bucks a share. I would stay current on their quarterly reports and news releases. They took out a massive loan from the chinese government last summer that threw up red flags for me. But the stock continued to rise. I decided to sell before the Q4 report came out, bc their debt to equity ratio had to be way off(but it wasn't being talked about). Anyways, I sold at about 55.00 a share, it hit 65.00 over the next few weeks, then dropped, and has since lost 50%. So I'm glad I sold when I did, I made a couple thousand, nothing crazy, but I was happy about that.

I still have a lot to learn. I'm willing to absorb and do my homework. 

Questions? I've only used Robinhood. With the heat they've been getting, I've considered changing platforms. What do you suggest?

Thoughts on SPAC's?

It was 2012, a different time. Price $175.75. Gains above 1,600%. If I had a time machine you‚Äôd think I‚Äôd go back and buy even more. Sure eventually.

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Add me, <GetUsToTheGreek>

I am new to the stock market and trading. I got into it because of GME and the other meme stocks. I remember hearing about GME on the news and seeing headlines regarding the stock, but didn‚Äôt actually get into it until sometime in late January and missed getting in on it before it took off. My first purchase of GME was for a fraction of a share when it was $350/share. I bought another fraction of a share that same day when it went down to $319. I began following WSB and read a lot of the posts. When shenanigans started with RH, I finally get brave enough to use my Schwab account for trading and bought my first whole share of GME. I have since acquired a few more and have been HODLing. I‚Äôm now looking into learning how to purchase options. I‚Äôm slow on the uptake when it comes to all of this, but I think (and hope) one day I‚Äôll know enough of what I‚Äôm doing to see a good return on my investments üòä"

Woke up one day to see BB stock had risen 48% back in February, which led me to here.

Keep rereading the rules for wsb plus the lingo...so got that going for me.

Without finding wsb, would never have put up $1100 of my own coin to own small numbers of Gme, AMC, BB, and Nokia. And they seem to be holding fine.

Its been fun, but I am a total retard and also work 60 plus hours a week as truckdriver.

My intent is to learn as much as possible to set up for my retirement in 5 years, but I'll always be able to drive as long as my health holds out.

I do love the humor and sharing in here, and only used reddit for golf clash tips prior to that Monday saw BB rise.

Now spend most of my time in here, plus info from YouTube,  and a free pdf Daytrader book found online.

I don't expect to win anything, but think I'll have fun."

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Indeed, they really do learn a lot about the subreddit and what everyone here‚Äôs values üòä"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I agree.  He has hunger in his heart!
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,So I don‚Äôt remember ever posting this.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Jumped into the ring when GME started and then I've been investing in SNDL, AMC, BB and NOK because I wanna see some real good companies come back with so much better crap than what I see.

2021-03-27 01:39:36,wallstreetbets,$APHA & $TLRY Stockholders Be Sure to Vote for the Merger 
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have both, voted for merger on both, however, i said no to creating more shares for the merger ( dilution )."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's worth noting, that because of the slight disparity between Apha and Tilray stock, you get a $1 on each share swapped from Apha.  I hope they don't change the tilray value last second to compensate.

e.g. used 2021-03-27 end of AH values below.

Apha: $ 17.33, Tilray 22.08.

100 Apha converts to 83.81 Tilray, marked down to 83 units (no fractional shares:

Post merger value: 83.81x22.08= $1850.52

Cost to buy 100 Apha: 100\*17.33=1733.

Delta (free profit) $117.52 from 100 shares.

that's assuming Apha doesn't go up in price, or tilray down.

Not financial advice."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,After a merger is there there generally a spike in price ?
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuvking merge already sheesh lol. I‚Äôm still holding my garbage position when I bought my ticket on the weed hype train.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I did a week ago.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Did that come in the mail? I want one! I just got an email .... üò≥

This merger is the only reason I bought APHA"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Both stocks got beat down like a rabid dog. Hope they can soar higher before the merger.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Vote yes for merger and no for more shares. :)
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,So the real objective here should be to get Apha down and Tilray UP!!! This would add value to your bag of Apha shares....
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Didn't get any email or anything. I'm in Europe.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Tilray is a cash burning turd - if I owned Aphria I would vote no. God bless.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,My APHA calls expire 4/16. Guess I timed that one right.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,What will the stock ticker be for this merged company? (Sorry if I used lingo wrong I am very new to invensting)
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"all I‚Äôm saying is merger trading has a pattern that experienced traders realize. Otherwise, have fun learning the hard way..."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well, I got to vote as a shareholder of both and I am neither Ryan Reynolds nor Canadian. I suppose I could have said that I am not Canadian and it would have satisfied both questions, but..."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,if you own shares you can vote
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I got an email about it and I could vote right through the email. It also let me sign up for the virtual meeting.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Would like to know this as well
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's all Gambling, TBH.  If you want my Monkey brain opinion.  I would say based on a quick 10 second scan of both stocks APHA has gone up drastically since people heard about this merger.  TLRY has had increased activity too.  I would say right now it is TLRY fairly priced with a chance to go up a bit...depending on the market.  Right now TRLY is a 20 dollar stock...maybe it is good for 35-40 at some point after the merger.  I bought some a few days ago.....might buy more.  Although I think AMC is good for a Double up over the summer if they open the doors to the theaters.  Then of course their is the GME squeeze....if it ever goes off."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Priced in, however, weed legalization could give a big bump to both like it did a in feb."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,If there's an expectation that the merger will go through - no. If there's expectation that the merger will not go through and it does - there's a spike in price but it could be a downwards spike.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Happy cake day!
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Yep. I received two packets in the mail yesterday.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"> vote for the merger

beyond what? vote for means vote yes. OP didn't say vote on."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ya but it‚Äôs weird tilray has a better name which is why the company wants to keep that, but keep aphria‚Äôs board. But also the combination of the assets gives them a strong hold in the market"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"They are merging under the Tilray name, so there will be no new ticker. TLRY will remain and APHA will go away."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,It certainly is outstanding!
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nice, at this rate I'll probably still be under water on apha even with the bump up lol"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Canuck here, waiting on my packet."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,smooth brain retardo question here: are the two stocks still gonna be traded individually under separate tickers if they were to merge or would the stocks merge as well?
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Cinemark is going down and they actually have money in the bank. Why do you think AMC will double?
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thank you, I didn't even notice it.  People like you make this community fuckin amazing. Too the moon with our eyes red!!"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,What if I own APHA options?
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I agree. Tilray is a cooler name. Aphria sounds like a medical condition.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Aphria becomes the world's largest producer in the process.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you!
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Packet here, waiting on my canuck."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,The stocks will merge and it will be under TLRY.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I believe it turns into tilray
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"I didn't do a ton of DD.  I have monkey palms and it is hard to click the keyboard.

But, if you look at their history before Covid they are good for 15 - 20 dollar a share.  At one point 30.  Plus there is the short argument.  I do not know enough about shorting to get into it.  But, on top of their usual pre covid stock price there is the fact that there is just a ton of activity around AMC right now.

It all really depends on what the government says.  If they open the doors for Movie theaters then Both Cinemark and AMC would go up.  I am not saying it is going to the moon.  Like I said I do not know enough about the short play to tell you that.  All I do as a primate is try to get in on the good money to make some bananas.

Edit: not financial advice.  This post was made from a Zoo."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Your contract is adjusted and you receive 83 shares of TLRY.  Strike price remains the same.

If you are going to trade the option you want to do it before the merger.  It becomes a non-standard option which have much lower demand.  If you are ITM and want to exercise you can hold on to it."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you today own 100 tilray and 100 apha, after the merger you will own 183.8 tilray shares.

Edit. Just realise you wrote options my bad"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I have sleep aphria. I smoke weed in my sleep.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,This post matters. Why are you being a douche?
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks!
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,No fractional shares from APHA to TLRY. Fractional shares will be rounded down.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Because you don't decide the faith of the company, look at the ownership first."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,What happens if you own 1 share of APHA? It's rounded down to 0 shares?
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Great question. I suppose you would receive no TLRY shares and instead get cash equal to what your one share of APHA would have sold for at the last recorded price before the combination. This is pure speculation on my part.
2021-03-27 01:26:29,wallstreetbets,"I still believe in a bullish bias for GME (Technical Analysis) Some of you all might be disappointed that we didn't have a crazy bull day like yesterday. Take a step back and look at the hourly time frame. GME had a huge 50+% day yesterday and dropped only <2% today. This is just healthy consolidation on LOW Daily volume.

This is what bulls want. RSI has cooled down on hourly. It's holding moving average supports and I'm thinking it will go back and retest today's highs next week. You want this to stair-step up when we don't have low volume and when big money steps in (notice how much room CMF has to curl up), then that's the big 20, 30, 40+% days.

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I've had to stop talking about it with people. I'm like i hope it dips so low i can buy a ton more and not have to average up. Everyone's like why didn't you sell when it was high you're delusional. I'm only here for life changing money i don't care about anything in between. Moon or zero that's all
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"I agree, I either want to see it blast off or tank for a day or two down to the 40s again so I can scoop up more before it rides to the skies."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"It had low volume when it started down trending.
We had almost 10m volume in the first hour, then got around 25m at the peak I believe, then the rest of the day was a trickle and the price started down trending."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Robinhood made it an arcade game. After all, what good is buying stock without confetti filling up your screen to make you feel good????"

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Pretty much the same as me dude. I had 400 bucks for a ""dip"", it went up to 220, dipped to 205 and started going back up so I got 6 @ 216 and 2 more when It got down to 189.
Holding 14 @214 average."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I had my buy limit at 160 :(

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I can‚Äôt even short it anymore.... TDA raised the margin rate on shorts to 300%
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,There is going to be some brutal margin plays with GME profits chasing this vibe when it‚Äôs all over
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Same place here, options were a thing lmao"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Look into options
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Oof!
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Just depends on how long you can hold imo. Don't sell yourself short every bit counts
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm thinking $1,000 will be a fake squeeze. $10,000 seems realistic. $100,000 is possible but a long shot.

If it does $20k x 8 that‚Äôs $160k. Not bad."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm talking about the $40 dip today. Cool if you caught it but it would be really tough to call the top when it hit $212 three times today. Everything looked like a sideways trading day or a small pop.

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't see that as a possibility though. It's nice to think about, but I would really be shocked if we see anything over $600. It won't be allowed to happen."

If the large HFS and MMs start getting liquidated, buckle your pants.

DTCC didn‚Äôt put 801 before the SEC not to use it if shit goes sideways."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Exactly this.  I believe it MIGHT get to $600 like you say, but I don't believe they'll ever let us get higher than that.  I mean, look what has happened so far.  Complete fuckery, every single time. They won't allow it to happen.  The gubment is on the hedgies side and that is why the hedgies keep getting away with it.  They got a mere slap on the wrist today.  They are not worried about us in the least.  

Believe me, I hope I'm proven wrong and that is why I keep buying and holding.  And that is what I will do until I am proven wrong."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"I just mean when it starts mooning the fuckery will start. Halts will happen. ""Technical difficulties"" will happen. Pauses will be made on US to give them time to straighten out and reposition."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Wasn't the gamma squeeze also a bubble? There was so much hype with all the support and attention. I'm sure a short squeeze would be bigger but not by an order of magnitude. I'll continue to hodl but I'm trying to figure out how far into a squeeze I should push my luck
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"My sentiments exactly. This is one of those instances where I would LOVE to hear a ""told you so!!!"" as we eclipse the moon, but the way it stands, we sucked billions out of these guys already and they aren't going to lose the other half, you can take that to the bank.

They will continue to short ladder attack and they will continue to force dips to make ITM go OTM. We haven't seen shit yet. They got a 250k little slap on the wrist, which was laughable. They can do that time and time again. What we're doing is fining them millions upon millions a day. I like that better."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,The squeeze will last days. And halts will happen.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Right.  Like they've done so far.  I think we'll be lucky to get six or eight.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is exactly why I have sell orders set for $477 to cash out my principal... I expect at the very least a double top, and after that I expect some market hedgie fuckery.  without any fuckery I would absolutely expect $10k...whether or not they will allow it happen, is another thing"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"A gamma squeeze, by its very nature, is short lived.

Imagine a bunch of people buy OTM calls for cheap.

As the stock price increases, the MMs need to hedge by buying stock. 

As the MM buys stock, the price increases, which makes more calls closer to being ITM.

As a result, they need to hedge for the next set of calls. Rinse repeat.

Eventually, there aren‚Äôt enough calls or the option chain tops out.

Once that happens, the market maker unloads all the shares.

The situation I‚Äôm hoping to see is a failure to deliver / short squeeze. This is a bubble but it can go MUCH higher. 

I don‚Äôt believe the SI is accurate. At all. They ran out of shares on iborrow and shorted the entire Russell 2000.

Citadel just got fined again today for actions in 2017-2019 RE: reporting. They‚Äôve been fined like 50+ times. They‚Äôre full of shit. The shorts didn‚Äôt cover. I imagine they‚Äôll have to buy the float many, many times over. 

At that point, the train goes completely off the tracks.

The DTCC is worried. They‚Äôre checking short positions DAILY. They‚Äôve asked the SEC for approval (801) to be able to liquidate (margin call) member accounts. They updated their ‚Äúdisaster‚Äù plan. The SEC just had a closed door meeting - presumably for criminal / whistle blower reasons (speculation based on the documentation). GME DD providers are getting death threats, the WSB mods got hi-jacked, the media is reporting down-ticks AS they happen (some screen shots of prewritten stories BEFORE it happens). 

None of the above is normal. One match can set this powder keg off. GME hasn‚Äôt even announced their new CEO or roadmap."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"The 250k fine tells me all I need to know.  I really don't appreciate them insulting our intelligence.  

I will continue scooping up share after share after share until we have them by the short and curlies.  ;)"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"The stock already mooned, it is currently mooned sitting at 2000% its real value."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Six or eight.....hundred....thousand? Agreed.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I set to get most of principal out at $333, this back when it was down to $40. Quite the surprise to wake up to it executed. Next up is $888 for most shares with a handful holding out for $5k. (Got a baby gorilla out of the deal too.)"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thank you for the excellent write-up but my question is what part of the gamma squeeze to $500 was from the actual squeeze and how much was from buying due to speculation and hype. I don't think we'll have an answer to that until after the dust settles.

I do think the short squeeze will happen and I do think it will be big. I'm hoping the Suez canal issue combined with all the crazy commodity shortages will be the catalyst that causes all the HF long positions to go red, resulting in a margin call, sending GME to the moon.  I don't know how far it will rise so I've set price alerts at a few key points and I'll play it by feel."

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,StIll with ya buddy!
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes but it‚Äôs not a fintech.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's almost like there is a limited number of shares available, and when shorts cover on Friday it spikes the price.

But RKT is a total scam meant to detract from GME."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"You ever watch To Catch a Predator?

There was a guy on there who was caught TWICE. He was snagged once and then a few months later, got snagged AGAIN. He wasn't too bright.

My point is, that the shorters got used to shorting RKT and don't know how to quit. With GME, they lost big, but they don't know how to stop. They could move on to a different stock that might produce but it's not as sweet as GME. RKT is similar. Maybe it's like the old saying, ""When you beat a dog every day of its life, the day you don't beat it, it misses the beating.""

RKT, as well as GME, are familiar ground. Even if they rack up losses or fines or get in trouble for driving the company into the ground, they creep back into it like a junkie.

And yeah, I correlated HF shorters to child molesters."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"My 10 year account sees your 1 year account, and says do some DD."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Your 10 year old account can be bought and sold, and the ""research"" pushed here was simply that the stock was heavily shorted and due to spike within a week after it was pushed initially. That never came. 

Don't presume this sub isn't now a target for exactly what I'm describing."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"The stock is heavily shorted. It has also had two spikes recently, even without the backing that GME has. 

The sub is a target for social engineering, but I don't think there are many bought accounts. I have yet to be contacted about my account. I have seen lots of new accounts though, pushing a bunch of terrible plays. I have also seen them push good plays. 

You have to do your DD on everything here (GME) included, and don't buy into the hype or the trash talking."

And buy more."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"For stocks that you want to buy anyway that seemingly keep going down,  just sell covered puts. Example: I sold 20 April 16 7.5 UWMC puts near the end of the day for $.40 each. Which means that I am willing to buy 2000 shares of UWMC for $7.50 on April 16th if they are under $7.50 by that time. For that, I get $800 today. And my collateral is $15000. I know its now less then a month away, but if I did that on March 16th, 800 divided by 15000 means that I am making 5.3333% return a month if it never hits $7.5... 5.333333% X 12 is a pretty good annual return by most metrics.  And if it does go below $7.5 by April 16th,  I wanted to own the stock anyway and now my cost basis is $7.1.

Edit: actually sold 22 puts, didn't see the other 2 execute"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,My $10 4/16 call is fucked.  Its down like 90%.

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I fuckin tried averaging down my 10c 4/16. I had 7 @ .89 cent average and tried to  buy 3 more for .10 limit but on Robinhood it was switched to SELL not BUY... fuck me.

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,tru.... BUT - what i'm sayin is that i was looking for a dip to get IN... so got nothing to sell ..... - yet..... :)
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,One month. It should be between April 23rd and 26th.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Let's hope so my friend. I got august calls. If I don't see action by eom april I might let them go.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,You sold 3 calls by accident? You should buy those back...
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I heard 5/5
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm literally so retarded that I didn‚Äôt even think of that... I just was like ahh fuck there they go and got pissed off and left the app. I‚Äôm gonna buy 6 on Monday

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah take that risk off the table unless you have the cash.

I should add if you have the shares too, you‚Äôre not at a cash risk you‚Äôre just capping your upside."

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,You do whatever you want with your money but just one serious question. Why didn't you just buy stocks? It would probably have been better for everyone involved. The premium is massive for the options anyway no?
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"You retarded bastard, good ape!"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"This isn't buying the dip. ""Buying the dip"" really involves buying the actual  stocks, not FDs, and it is supposed to be a long term investment. What you did was actually fucking retarded..."

Right now, shares are selling for $26.15 after hours. Anything under $29 and you profit when the sale goes through.

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"I only have a really small position in this stock (10 shares) but I was wondering why the price didn't go up much higher than $26 as well. At current price, you'd make 10%+ just for parking your cash in this stock till the deal is finalized. I heard some people saying it won't be till end of year but that's still basically free money. Only thing to consider is if shareholders vote against the sale and opportunity cost."

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes!!!! Major GUH! Lol you don‚Äôt need the capital upfront if it‚Äôs a multi leg option trade unless you‚Äôre trade is net negative and costs you money- which at times could be worth the money to raise your strike price. Live and learn man, live and learn"

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs not the way
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Egh, if it makes you feel better, I was wiped out on GME calls last week."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Those sub $120 GME puts never had a chance. $200 is the way to go if you're going to try it.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,They say you get what you deserve.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Puts are contracts to sell 100 shares of stock at the strike price - they can be sold (""sell to close"") before they expire. Ape wants the stock price to go down so that the Put expires ITM. That night, the wife's boyfriend orders some pizza delivery for Ape and says, ""Ape, you deserve a night off."" Then they go downstairs together to do laundry. Ape hears the dryer banging around and thinks, ""She probably overloaded it, again."" Then they go upstairs to fold clothes. Ape thinks, ""Hahaha! They forgot to bring the laundry with them.""

However, if the price surges skyward on Friday, Ape is at risk of losing everything when his option expires worthless (OTM). Fortunately, Ape can place a conditional order to sell the Put ""sell to close"" when the value (premium) of the Put comes within 10% of what Ape paid for it. If the condition is met, the Put is automatically sold and Ape gets a 10% profit (in OP's case, $1000) instead of a 100% loss. Ape would do this if the stock is clearly heading for the moon with no indicator of slowing down."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Selling $50 CSPs is literally free money. Best part is I truly do want to be assigned
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Why are you against the curve bro?
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Sorry not sorry.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,You could have sold a put and make a grand in a week...
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the money bitch
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"I still don't understand puts. Calls I get, puts? Nope."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Deserved.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,GME dropped ~50% in 1 day and you didn't take that as a sign to take profits?
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,The cost of trying to be crafty.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck you for buying puts. All my homies love CSPs

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"every story needs an antagonist, thank you for playing your part"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Imagine doubting the apes
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I honestly don't know why you would try to take the wrong side of the bet...
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Stop bashing GME put buyers. I make a living selling those options!
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Shoulda just bought shares buckaroo

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thank Blackrock, they are bleeding calls and puts."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Imagine being retarded enough to get against GME
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"if you cant beat em, dm them to meet up and fuck and then subsequently join them"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,dude... 100 maybe... but no way those p60/p75 would print if you held
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Should have sold $100 puts instead...
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Noone told you to not to play with GME options? With buy and hold you actually don't lose any money.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I sold you you some of these
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Try again next week
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Admire the balls but laugh at the stupidity.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Why the hell would you buy puts on GME? Millions of apes, hundreds of DDs and you learn nothing lol"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I mean you could try do it again. It‚Äôs going to keep dipping with the ocassional spike. Especisially now would be a good idea
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I see what you did wrong. Used your brain didn‚Äôt you? Nice loss porn. Thanks for posting.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Look at the Statue of Liberty and weep, motherfucker!"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I sold some of those.  I sold some $60 puts and thought who in the world would buy these?
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think the lesson here is to stop betting against GME and more importantly, WSB."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Time to switch sides
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"$15 a share as well, did you wait for the bottom of the dip or something?"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Apes forgive you, chase your losses with some $GME shares."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Haha fuck you
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"We should be thanking him. When I buy puts on any stock, it skyrockets. Thanks for taking one for the team."

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,good now get some shares and help the fuckers out that bought in a t 300+

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Can't say I feel bad when you would have made a lot of money on the dip and would have helped fuel the rocket. You see thousands of posts in opposition of your bet and you do it anyways... The very definition of smooth brain.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"dude what r u doing. GME didn‚Äôt even touch a 100 the whole week and u decide to get puts at 60,75 and a 100."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"So if you want to go short on GME do what I did.

Buy 5 calls and short 500 shares. That will let you ride this out w/o worrying about a margin call."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've been writing GME puts for like a month. Already met your money, but glad to meet you too!"

But, I guess we'll wait and see might still end up in the money. You know if there's a margin call or something. With today's action though I think I got a decent call for $65. Thanks hedgies you keep lowering the branches for me and I'll climb this tree with minimal effort."

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,people dont get it .. but its exactly because they wanted your put premium that it went up.  Youre not the only one who lost big on gme puts.  You shoulda sold wed.

This critique brought to you by someone who holds less than 5k in a portfolio that is more than 80% GME shares, so obviously you should take it to heart."

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I feel put is an one moment thing and you really need to keep an eye on and then grab the profits and leave. It usually bounces back very quickly. But growing would be lasting way longer. It‚Äôs easier to deal with calls if you do not have time

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"What sucks is when you get a nice set of options for a few different stock, say for like $1,000 each. Anyone would be lucky if half of them printed. Now think about it. Half turn into big fat goose eggs, the other half are profitable. If you don't allow those profitable plays to play out, it's all for nothing. Like if you cash out at +50% and don't wait for it to bloom, your account will be a net loss. When factored in to the goose eggs.


Really playing options is all about the yolo moves rather than diversified moves. You need imbalance in your portfolio, and luck on your side. That way you can pull out at 50% and be profitable overall."

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Puts are generally really expensive and the most you can make is when the stock goes to zero which is unlikely. Why not just buy calls when they have infinite profit? Just because you can trade puts doesn't mean you should, and that goes for calls as well. You're not going to time every trade correctly so why bother trying to do so? If you're that confident tesla is going to crash just wait until it does and just buy the stock. Patience is something extremely rare among option traders because they want money now, but so does everyone else. Good luck with those puts."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Why wont you write calls
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Omg dont do it. Lol
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Aka call credit spreads.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"yea man you go play with your little call credit spreads and trade 500 times a week making 100% at most while your broker takes thousands from you from commissions.

Coulda cashed out on some calls yesterday for almost 4K profit...rode it down to 1K and I have one still open that would wipe that out if it doesnt work its way to black. Probably just going to sell on the first inevitable initial impulse wave on Monday and take maaaaybe a $500 overall gain.

I want to believe the strategy of dumb holding calls will payoff with GME if it does mOoOn, cause the leverage is insane when it rips, but its tough not listening to that voice saying PT here you fucking moron and then it being right every time lol.

I do have this sub to thank for teaching me about options tho. Been a wild ride."

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Good perspective. 

As I see it, the vicious cycle of capitalism or currency ""value"" is less about motivation and more to do with an initial addictive logic that builds up into a state of widespread cultural coercion. The natural training within that culture is degraded down to the imaginary idea that ""if people didn't get money, they'd do nothing!"" That's complete nonsense. Those people *think* that way, and anyone that really *requires* money *feels* that way because they've been raised under a system that constantly focuses our lives around those intermediary value units.

In fact, I believe the logic mirrors grades in schooling. It makes the students feel tediously tested(untrusted,) and directly trains people for being as absolutely as detached and apathetic as possible about their classes(and careers,) but the systemic competition of capitalism *also* means profit-driven exploitation becomes as maximized as possible, meaning they slowly acclimate to accepting more and more resentment and less and less power."

Call me insensitive but why hate money when the real problem is our relationship to money. Money is only a tool to help you express yourself and it‚Äôs only as good or bad as you make it. We‚Äôre all fallible ~~human beings~~ apes who get greedy and arrogant and we all need experiences and mentors that teach us not to be assholes. It‚Äôs not the fault of having a system of currency because some people with large amounts of money never got the proper guidance or were guided into believing greed is good. 

Hating money just seems like misdirected anger to me."

If I invested more, I would have had a  79 average. the reason it won't get bellow 40 until the shorts cover their position, as with hindsight, i should have invested more at 40. So many more people would invest at 40, that it won't get bellow that till after the short squeeze, where the stock is no longer being massively shorter."

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Yea but selling for small profits sets the clock back for them and delays the squeeze. Buying and holding is the only way imho. Not financial advice.

2021-03-27 00:14:06,wallstreetbets,Live look inside The Motley Fool board meeting. 
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"i love how you silenced the dudes speaking but kept the ""no no"" audio. perfection"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,But they recommended Netflix at 2 dollars 20 years ago!
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"I bought into them when I first started out in stocks a few years back. Literally every pick they gave me, returned $0 in profit. I inquired and they tried to upsell me to some other bullshit. All they do is take your money and recommend you keep subscribing to more of their shit."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"I bought a year membership because it was only $100. By the end of the first week, I stopped opening their emails or checking their page. All it is is ads for their other products. That site is a joke"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"They send out emails saying ‚ÄúHas your portfolio earned 100% in the last two years‚Äù

That‚Äôs a scam. If they could average 100% returns they would be worth $billions."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,It's really nice to see this sub calling them out. They like to take advantage of people.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"I will admit I subscribed for a while.  I made some really good trades when I first followed their advice.  Then I continued to follow their advice and ... didn't.

It took me awhile to figure it out.  Longer than I care to admit."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Did I miss something? I used to see like 1 shitpost a quarter about them and now I've seen like 10 in the last 2 days
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,And to think I almost signed up with them this year. BUY GME.... NO WAIT GME is shit here are 3 other stock you should buy..... nO wAiT bUy GmE.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"""Buy this stock now!"" From the man who bought Apple at $1.42, comes his next stock pick prediction!"" Just pay $399, subscribe, and sift through pages of absolute bullshit just to find the ticker..."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,why you shouldn't by these future 10 baggers....followed by....how we told you to buy those future 10 baggers
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôve been trying to shut my account down with them. They make it nearly impossible.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"""We are so good with the stock market, we have to charge outrageously expensive prices for something you can just get for free with Google, just to stay afloat as a company! That is how confident we are with our stock picks."""
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Do not click any article by these fools. This is the way for now.

I'm sure Pepperidge Farm remembers who.

(edit - now I remember, or rather I googled - they were kind of quirky and fun when I first got into stocks in 1998, then got spammy and clickbaity after going to a subscription model in 2002. )"

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"That‚Äôs why they‚Äôre called The Motley ‚ÄúFool‚Äù.

You‚Äôre a fool if you believe them."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Using Simply Wall Street. They don‚Äôt make recommendations but the analysis for decision making is pretty good. Dashboards are great and easy to follow and information is updated regularly.

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I am subscribed to their stock advisor service for about a year soon. The best picks in my portfolio are from them. I bought nearly every pick and would guess my average there is about 50%. And 3 picks I also where able to double my invest. The clickbait and the articles are useless though.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"I hate Motley fool. I have their subscription because Amex offered for free. Figured it was worth a shot. Their suggestions every Tuesday are crap.

Edit: I think they recommend to pump their own fucking positions."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Motley fool straight up having two false positives. They can never make up their mind and I guarantee you they take it from behind from citadel. That's their sugar daddy.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fun story - I used to be involved with providing market data and securities pricing for Motley Fool‚Äôs services. I was a POC at a company providing the data, having to maintain the relationship with their team if they had any problems with our feeds. Consistently one of the worst groups of people to try and manage an account for, they always bugged us for the most mundane shit (most of the time their problems were their own fault) and I always dreaded hearing from them. Not sure if I wish I could remember or am glad I forgot the names of the people I‚Äôd have to deal with, I just remember they were pushy assholes. Not surprised at this behavior."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Hey pardon me but Im late to the party on why we hate the motley fool....can anyone inform me?

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"They put together long videos about the amazing stocks that they think are going to the moon, and they'll tell you what they are if you'll just sign up for this amazing deal of a one-time offer just for you. 

Then you sign up and they spam the shit out of you about how they've got these amazing stock picks for you if you just level-up to the next stage of inside track they've got for you, for just another small fee.

Which you do, and that qualifies you to receive a whole additional level of spam and offers to let you in on this amazing market secret for just another small fee which is really nothing, since now you're practically one of the guys and they really want to let you in on it so you don't get left behind...

And so forth. I subscribed once for a couple hundred $, when I really couldn't afford it but thought it might be a good idea. It wasn't, and they really never gave me one useful stock pick as far as I recall. I got sick of them and sent their email to spam. Which was a mistake, as there was fine print on the sign-up I missed, which led to them taking $400 out of my account for an auto-renew two years later.

I raised hell and got it back, but fuck those guys."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I get soooo many ads from them right now.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"You don't need to pay, just subscribe to their podcast. They are tools."

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm glad to see her moving up in the world. She definitely deserves it.

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Why does that matter...at all...
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Read the comments.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"By the way, gamestop did not make our top list of companies to invest in. Pay us to find out who did.

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,No I always feel the same way whenever their ads pop up on YouTube. just their condescending tone whenever they talk pisses me the f*** off. Like how do you think acting like you're user base is beneath you going to be a good business model. Seriously f*** them and their stupid way they treat their user base. I really think they're just a voice piece for hedge funds overall.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Should've just followed this channel. I mean equally bad investing advice but at least we're honest at how bad we are.

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I also hate seeing their ads.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's just 100% false. Their stock picks are actually the same bunch of stocks over and over. They'll keep recommending them as long as they have conviction in them. One of the reasons I stopped subscribing to them is the fact that I couldn't find any more new ideas. They might write about a lot of stocks but the recommended lists from their services is small.

I won't defend their lame ass marketing techniques but it annoys me to see outright lies about them."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Except, well.. math.  Indexes are market cap weighted and the vast majority of market returns are made by a handful of stocks.  It‚Äôs a mathematical fact. All other stock returns become de minimus. 

This is what The Motley Fool is communicating. Having skin in the game on lots of promising stocks, gives you a chance at picking an Amazon, Netflix, or Intuitive Surgical.   No one, yes, no one could have predicted the stock performance of these companies.  They were a shell of themselves when The Motley Fool picked them. They weren‚Äôt geniuses. No one who buys a stock is a genius. Amazon was DOWN 80% from its high at one point. The innovators at these companies are the geniuses.  Thousands of innovators working together over years and years under a shared purpose creates massive economic value. The stock simply weighs this.

All investors have to do is find companies that may be massively more important in the future, and click buy.

Most of Warren Buffett‚Äôs wealth is attributed to time in the market. He‚Äôs been investing for 70+ years (allegedly since age 10). Compounding at an average of 22% a year takes over."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ha ha, whenever I want reinsurance of poor decisions I just put whatever ticker symbol is my biggest loser into motley fool."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"They‚Äôve picked and unpicked every stock in existence. 

No matter what happens they can point to an article that predicted it would happen. 

It‚Äôs like playing roulette and putting a chip on every single number..."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I have followed since 2019.... have never lost money on one of their picks.....
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,That looks really good. Bookmarked the page and will come back to it later when I have money to speculate/invest again.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just checked it out mate and looks good! Do you cover the FTSE or just NYSE? Also, any other wins outside of TLRY?"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nah, blackberry and Nokia"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,While compared to recent board changes like we saw at Exxon. Those were praised by the MSM.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I don't think investors actually use motley fool. Maybe dumb boomers who want to make 1% return
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ah, should have guessed that this sub is hating on Motley Fool because they said something that wasn't unquestioningly positive about GME.

Besides Luckin coffee, I don't remember ever losing money in any of their picks over the years.  Just modest gains at worst because they screen pretty tightly for quality."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wrong.

‚Äúthose who attach all of Buffett's success to investing acumen miss an important point. The real key to his success is that he's been a phenomenal investor for three quarters of a century. Had he started investing in his 30s and retired in his 60s, few people would have ever heard of him.‚Äù

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"You miss the point.  Compounding (e.g. time in the market) matters MORE than average annual returns.  From the research:

‚ÄúAnd let‚Äôs say he still went on to earn the extraordinary annual investment returns he‚Äôs been able to generate ‚Äî 22% annually ‚Äî but quit investing and retired at 60 to play golf and spend time with his grandchildren?

 What would a rough estimate of his net worth be today?

Not $81 billion. 

$11.9 million (99.9% less than his actual net worth). 

Effectively all of Buffett‚Äôs financial success can be tied to the financial base he built in his pubescent years and the longevity he maintained in his geriatric years. 

That‚Äôs how compounding works. Think of this another way: Buffett is the richest investor of all time. But he‚Äôs not actually the greatest ‚Äî at least not when measured by average annual returns. ‚Äú"

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"The reason oil has been going up 5% every day has a lot to do in part with the Suez canal blockage, which is now delaying an estimated $400 million per hour. Even when the canal re-opens, it could take up to two days to clear the backlogged traffic and some ships are even opting to take the longer route around the horn of Africa which costs an additional 6-9 days and $500 million in costs per ship.

The share cost of oil isn't something an average retail investor can afford, and anyone interested in scalping oil stocks should have already been doing it days ago, but this will likely end up dragging further before stabilizing/dropping. The route for oil tankers from Texas to Asia has to adapt and improvise, and either wait it out or go around the long way with an increased risk of sea piracy.

Just something interesting I was looking at while GME bounced around and settled at 180, I am not a financial advisor."

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"GuhME should unironically be studied as the perfect storm of cult creation. You're presented with the seemingly plausible idea that you have insider knowledge of an opportunity, borne from esoteric knowledge held by a little-known but loyal community. You are welcomed in. Here it is: we happen to know that a stock is over-shorted, and if something is over-shorted, then just by holding the asset you'll be able to name your price! The billionaires will be your slaves! But the catch is, the only way to win is to not sell, to never sell, in fact, you need to buy more, and any break in solidarity will jeopardize the whole endeavour! But there are nefarious forces at work to thwart the plan... the brokers, the hedge funds, the media... they're all trying to break the solidarity! So don't believe anything that dissuades you. You must always believe, or we all go down. 

Sounds familiar?

Sprinkle in some shared coded language, slogans and rallying cries, some pseudo-scientific plausible analysis. Stir it up in a brave tale of rallying to a cause, with the endgame not just being the restoration of the natural order of good and evil, but you'll also make insane money in the process! And just look... the whole world is following your cause! Celebrities, politicians, business magnates! And you're smart enough to be on the winning team!

Made my next 50k slower and proceeded to yolo it all into $SNOW puts with 2 weeks till expiry. Stock price shot up 20% in one day while I was flying home from visiting my family down in Florida and lost 80% of it. Held until I lost it all. 

Took 20k I set aside for taxes I owed and yolo‚Äôd into GameStop. I then made 1.3 mil. I lost 98% of it and went to 35k at my lowest. 

I took a step back and started thinking much harder and decided Puts were the way. EV sector puts so far have brought me back to 150k.

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"It would definitely plunge the price badly! How bad, it depends from share float/volume and etc! But you really cant sell 50% of the company at once! They would halt the trading and you have to be institution to have that much % of the company also! So basically only big banks can do that like in 2008!"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"How much it drops the stock is going to depend on too many factors for anyone here to say.  

First, in order to sell that much they would need to sell it over time.  It's unlikely there are going to be enough limit buy orders just waiting for them to sell 50% of the available float.  

Second, it would depend on how long they took to sell.  Dumping a little here and there over a long period is going to tank the price much much less than dumping a lot all at once.

Third, it would also depend on the volume of that particular stock during the time they are wanting to sell.  So, if that stock saw a volume of 100k a day, a low volume, then they would have a really hard time disguising their sale, which would likely cause other investors to sell as soon as they saw it coming, because they would either want out before the price started going down so they could either stay out, or just buy back in for less money once the price does go down.  

Fourth, it would depend on if they were doing a direct private sale or if they were going on the open market.  If they did a direct private sale and kept it private then I don't believe it would have any material effect on the stock price.

All of the above except #4 will result in the stock price going down.  How much is just dependent on how they do it.  All that being said, I've never been in a position to own more than 10% of a publicly traded company, and there are lots of SEC rules related to entities that own substantial portions of a publicly traded company's stock.  People with more wrinkles in their brains, or at least more miles on their investment accounts, might be able to tell you better if three are special rules for selling stock if you're selling over certain amounts..."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"It'd probably cause a halt due to volatility, not having enough buy orders to fill the sell order, and during the halt it would gain a lot of attention and people would line up tons of buy orders during the halt if they felt it was suddenly undervalued or if they felt like the price would bounce up for a quick flip.  Probably trigger a ton of stops, cause even more volume, dip like 20% in total and pop back up.

Share price is literally just the price of the last share to be traded at the best bid and ask on the market and it has in no way a linear relationship with volume or a hypothetically massive sell or buy order.  Price would reach a point where people would dive in to buy or sell and the price would stabilize"

u/crage88 asked "" Someone update this and tell me the boom is still coming "" ok. It's still coming.

In my previous posts I said that I think it would be sometime within the next 3 months. That's still true. So if you're buying weekly calls for April, I mean, that's not 3 months, that's 1 month. So maybe it'll happen before then, maybe not. I'm pretty confident for the stock to have turned around by June/July and be roaring into the fall.

The stock is still trading with the NASDAQ, meaning money managers, hedge funds, and algorithms are not trading AMD directly, they're trading the entire NASDAQ. And right now the emphasis is on re-opening stocks and traditional stocks, that means money going into reopening stocks needs to come from somewhere, so they're taking it from tech. And they're not being picky, they're just taking it from ALL of tech, AMD included. At some point they're going to realize that AMD is going to 100 and get on board for the rally, at that point the algorithms will catch a ride followed by dumb individual investors who like to buy high and sell low. When is that going to happen? Before June is my guess.

THE MARKET IS AS SMART AS A 5 YEAR OLD. AMD fell recently because Intel announced plans to build a new fab plant in the US and make chips for other companies. This should have triggered the opposite reaction but the market is stupid and thinks ""if Intel good, then AMD bad."" What's going on here is Intel is trying to cash in on the chip shortage that has been so profitable for TSMC and Samsung. This is a great business plan for Intel, especially with Biden giving out money to help make it happen. But what it means is Intel is more focused on becoming a competitor in the fab space than on working really hard to take market share back from AMD. This also means that TSMC will not want to sell fab allocations to Intel if they can avoid it, since Intel is now becoming a direct competitor, meaning more chips for AMD. AMD should have shot up on this news but it fell because the market is dumb.

I'm not the only one that realized this. Northland Capital Markets analyst Gus Richard upgraded AMD‚Äôs stock to outperform (buy) for the same reasons.

[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/amd-could-benefit-from-intel-faux-pas-analyst-says-in-upgrade-11616677895](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/amd-could-benefit-from-intel-faux-pas-analyst-says-in-upgrade-11616677895)

More and more analysts are starting to beat the Buy drum on AMD. When this happens, it's important to pay attention to the price and what the CEO says in interviews. If the stock is high and the CEO plays it down, it's a signal to sell. But in this case, the stock is cheap and the CEO is constantly touting 37% growth this year and $3 future EPS. I say buy the dip, if it goes down to 70, buy some more.

I hold 550 shares of AMD and have about 40 calls spread out with expirations between April 2021 and June 2022.

But this is not financial advice, I just like the stock."

I kept thinking to myself, ""what is the strategic advantage of making that announcement publicly?""  Usually, major strategy changes come with a ton of secrecy as they take time to execute.  Announcing publicly like that ""seemed"" like just something to placate shareholders.  But maybe there is a good reason I just haven't thought of or heard about yet.  Maybe signaling to the U.S. government to ""help us become great with funding and tax breaks""?  That's the best I could think of.

Net net, it's all a very curious situation and I too am interested in the strategic ramifications (e.g., TSMC isn't stupid enough to announce, but they very well may start prioritizing AMD, as the article mentions).  Ultimately, strategy & execution affect long term stock price, not pontification."

AMD can't up their production. They are already selling basically everything they make at already elevated prices and unlike Intel they don't have any fabs of their own.

Long term I believe Intel will prevail because they have their own fabs(be it lackluster atm). Especially due to them building a fab on US soil. That will allow them to bid into big secret military shit. They fired their retarded management and put actual engineers in charge. I believe Intel more than AMD tbh."

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,">Announcing publicly like that ""seemed"" like just something to placate shareholders. 

That's exactly what it was. 

Their engineering situation status is: fucked, and it's going to be years before they get it in order, and even then there's no guarantee they can beat AMD's designs which stand on their own and will only get better, and TSMC's processes which are going to get further ahead over the next couple of years.

Who's even going to want to use Intel's foundries? They're not leading edge now. TSMC and to a lesser extent Samsung are safer bets. Intel doesn't even have a foundry that's capable of meeting their own GPU requirements, Xe GPUs are being made at TSMC.

They're pitching some of their strategy on ""national security"" hoping people conveniently ignore that they have 4 facilities in China. They're little safer in terms of being compromised than TSMC is in reality. Both could have facilities and IP seized if the party decides that's what it wants.

It's also cheap for them to say ""trust us, we're switching to a US+Europe production model"" because 1) it potentially gets them semiconductor funding under legislation^1 the administration is talking up and 2) they already have most of their fabs in those places. It costs them nothing. Meanwhile TSMC is already building a fab in Arizona.

As for TSMC prioritising AMD, AMD doesn't really need it. I'm sure the value and potential of AMD isn't lost on them so they're likely not going to kill the golden goose in the womb, but AMD's actually set really well right now. Not being on a leading edge node is a good thing for them. It allows Apple to pay for yield improvements and development and then they come in a year or so later and reap the rewards as the price is lower so their margins are higher. AMD's well set for a price war if it comes to that later, but in the meantime they're paying off debt and acquiring Xilinx, which could yet be a game changer. 

While Intel's management has floundered AMD's is amazing."

>Especially due to them building a fab on US soil. That will allow them to bid into big secret military shit. They fired their retarded management and put actual engineers in charge. I believe Intel more than AMD tbh.

What? They already have fabs on US soil, and soon so will TSMC. AMD was the first to exascale computing for the government after Intel missed their deadline and had delays on theirs. Intel's even having to use TSMC for their GPUs for those computers, that's how off the mark they are right now.

https://www.amd.com/en/products/exascale-era

Concerns over national security are Intel fabrications."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I don‚Äôt know. I use to think the same thing but their bungling of their tick/tock strategy over the last few years seems to show either they need to rethink their die shrinkage entirely (the same way AMD did with chiplets) or come up with something that will make them viable in the enthusiast/prosumer market. They still rule enterprise but I don‚Äôt know for how long as ARM processors are already in that space along with AMD. The former being the real threat to them I don‚Äôt see Intel being boss hog in 20 years. They might go the way of IBM or worse be like Sun and be an IP farm for a Corp like Oracle.

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"> when their existing operations are still having difficulty with the 7nm process.

They're not even doing great with 10nm. Most of their fabs are still 14nm.

>TSM and Samsung will have moved on to 5nm while Intel is just getting 7nm under control.

TSMC is already on 5nm with Apple using it, and AMD moves onto it later this year for products released next year as Intel has a 10nm that is hardly better than 14nm. 

Their 10nm switch was for investors, not consumers."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Buying high instead of low.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Bought 1000 then sold 500 when it hit $52 (one reason they call me Ricky). Now buying on dips when I sell something that peaks.  Not quite diamond hands but maybe one day.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Amd has a PE ratio of 71.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Strike?
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Your thoughts are due to ARM, or? Also holding NVDA (have been for a long while, though)."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm too lazy or dumb one of the two.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"The 2% dividend is only 20% of free cash flow, intel might not catch up soon but the dividend is not one of the reasons why"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Okay, cool. Thank you."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"85, reporting for duty"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Where are you getting this? TD shows AMD at a PE ratio of 37 for me.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,600 :/ Not the best
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not related to ARM (but that would be nice though), I mostly base it on the news of DLSS 3.0 universal support and upcoming Nintendo Switch tech. Last I‚Äôve seen, Nintendo sold their consoles like hot cakes and definitely proved its gonna rival the big names like PlayStation and Xbox in sales and gaming exclusives.

Also, I believe that video cards are getting very close to a model that would depend less on the hardware but more on software optimization instead. The future is behind technologies like DLSS or AI enhanced picture that would give you huge performance boost on higher resolutions. AMD knows it and works on it too, but have to admit, so far Nvidia is years ahead on that."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,They need to use that or some of the other 80% to figure out how to stop getting crushed. Their product is very quickly becoming vastly inferior.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,It's not your turn yet.  How hard was it to wait for Bob to comment first?
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you believe software will be the future bottleneck on GPUs, then your focus should be on AMD, rather than NVDA. Their GPUs consistently outperform NVDA when midrange CPUs are used, due to AMDs software having much better optimization for the average user. This points to NVDA not having much room for growth in terms of CPU usage optimization, meanwhile their Software lags behind. For AMD it's the opposite; Software highly optimized already, CPU usage awaiting improvement."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"They have $20 billion in the bank.

Money's not the issue for Intel, it's been management. They bought out all their engineers in payouts over the years and now they're seeing the results. This will take time to fix, not money."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Waiting for their chiplet GPU
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Right and Intel is fixing it by bringing in new management but it takes at least a year just to hire and spin up new talent. much less develop new tech.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Exactly, and TSMC and AMD aren't going to be sitting on their hands either."

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"The push was likely due to calls getting hedged as shorts covered. They were likely already partially hedged. 

We will only see a spike if people FOMO in, buying shares or calls. Most likely though, the stock will drop as shorts re-establish position."

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dude I feel so sorry for your calls. Yesterday my March calls from 195, 210,220,225,235,250 every of them expired worthless. So we both are truly retard"

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,You belong here
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,How fucking stupid you gotta be to yolo options on the most heavily manipulated stock on the market right now. Hope this award at least makes you feel a bit better about your blinding stupidity.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Nah you dumb idiot. You wanted to get rich fast with OTM weeklies and got your dick stuck in the cookie jar.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Narrator: It wasn't the right play.

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Uh he could have bought 190c far itm and still expired worthless

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"While we are here for retarded bets we should atleast do smart retarded bets, and gme weeklies are definitely not smart retarded bets, especially because we should be buying shares and not calls"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's so true that so many people read up on it and go ""Hey, I can do that."" Then lose their ass. 

The two I bought were done with that in mind. I have no fucking idea what I'm doing, well, maybe a little, but not much. So I tested the water with a couple small plays to see what I could learn. So far I've learned nothing more than how to vaporize cash..."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"That‚Äôs not the point. When you buy a call from a market maker, they remain delta neutral by buying an equivalent amount of shares. The farther ITM the option is, the more shares will be bought.

Just imagine if he bought an option at a 10$ strike, the seller of the call will have to buy 100 shares to cover the delta since it‚Äôll be at if not near 1.0. It‚Äôs almost the equivalent of him buying 100 shares himself since it‚Äôs unlikely the stock will drop below $10."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Im 50 years old and patience trully a virtue. Please forgive my grammar.and english. My respect to you. At least you tried and learned from your decision.

Wishing you well.


Drive safe. Dont text and drive.  Get home."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,And a $10c is 100x the price of 1 share... So you might as well just buy the shares yourself at that point
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ha! I'm 61 years old, there's no fucking way I can text AND drive!

I like to gamble, and while stocks in general are not gambling as much, options are rolling the dice. 

Just like doing some research and learning about the ponies, picking random with out good info is a losing ticket. And even with good intel, a win is not a guarantee. Same thing applies to options, just that the best are typically larger.

I have no intentioon of getting in to some of these strategies such as puts, splits, straddles, condors, etc... I am certain that would lead to homelessness..."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes I know that, but I'm justifying why buying certain options can also be just as effective as buying the stocks themselves to add a supply/gamma pressure."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"My respect 61 years young brother!!
You kick my butt brother!!!

Stay the.same.and never change!!!

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"My son, who is 31, told me about the whole GameStop thing. He was really excited about what an historic event this is. So I started reading and jumped on board at $306 back in late January, early February. 

My son is very conservative with money, he has just 5. Me, the gambler, yeah, I'm pushing toward high double digits.

After reading up on this, it's truly exciting and lots of fun. Just wish a lot of these kids would be more careful with the money. But, hell, I wasn't when I was their age..."

Based off of the political climate and future of interest rates my gut tells me they may run fairly stagnant for a while. From time to time, I‚Äôll jump into a spec stock and run it short term, but it‚Äôs usually a small win or a loss against capital gains for tax reasons. 

This group of apes however is impressive. It‚Äôs still a spec buy, but it‚Äôs a commitment to hold. I‚Äôm convinced there is value outside of fundamentals if enough retards are willing to stay the course. If I lose it, I lose it. But I ain‚Äôt going anywhere, and I ain‚Äôt selling my positions.

I understand the idea of not exercising OTM and you'd average up instead, but if you truly believe it's going to be worth more eventually; YOLO!

I understand if I'm wrong, just let me know instead of down voting me or do both. I just keep seeing call options close enough to an actual realistic price. Also I understand doing options with no intent to exercise, but it's GME. You're allowed to be retarded here on this."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Why didnt you sell when you were up. Truly retarded

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"I get bored of all the GME talk around here lately, but the fact that you've lost $70k in 0dte in the past couple weeks is definitely post worthy. I dont have anything to give you, but hopefully the next one works out in your favor."

2021-03-26 22:58:51,wallstreetbets,"You're making a mistake if you sell your Tesla shares today. I'm posting this because Tesla is down today and I know a lot of you probably sold. I'm here to help guide you back to the light and hopefully get you to buy back your shares before we close today.

I want to start off by saying a lot of people have been freaking out over the past few weeks because Tesla's market cap is higher than other car manufacturers COMBINED. A lot of people think Tesla is overvalued, but I want to dispel this anti-Tesla heresy by making an analogy:

**Tesla is making the iPod and other manufacturers are still making the SONY Walkman.** 

It is true that as far as a ""cars made"" Tesla has produced fewer ""cars,"" but the product Tesla is making is superior. These types of arguments are illusory because they don't compare apples to apples - they're just trying to put an idea in your head.

Instead of selling your shares - you should be buying more right now. I am not a Tesla cultist in anyway. I'm just point out that the people who are taking a dump on Tesla are intentionally misrepresenting arguments in order to persuade you into agreeing with them. A lot of big money sold Tesla before this move down and I guarantee you they're short the company. They want you to sell and then cover only to buy when it dips into the 500s again.

**How to exit a stock without letting your emotions guide you:**

In all honesty the best piece of advice I can give is to have a check list when you sell any stock. I know a lot of you are like, WhAt'S aN ExiT StrAtEGy? I know a lot of you hate charts so I won't even try to talk about a moving average. But what I will say is this:

1. Ask yourself if you still like the stock.  If it's yes then go to 2. if no, then sell. I don't care why you like a stock, just have an honest conversation with yourself.
2. Ask yourself: Do I need to liquidate these shares because of an emergency? If yes, then liquidate. If no, then hold. 
3. Has GME gone under $100? If yes, then sell all TSLA shares and buy GME. This is obvious, but I thought it needed to be mentioned. I'm joking of course. You should never sell GME shares.

**Closing thoughts:**

Good luck to everyone. Remember, you can buy back in. I'm just saying... I'm also not even sure how to flare this so I'm putting it on as DD. The current price is 607.20. We will see how we go.

I love all of you. Even the bears.

Obligatory rockets.

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Apple was actually making money with the iPod though..
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I've traded TSLA for 10 years.  Ive been selling calls on it for a while now. Weekly chart points to $420-$450 which is still a very high valuation for the stock. Do you understand why it ran up so much before inclusion?
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,">Tesla is making the iPod and other manufacturers are still making the SONY Walkman.

You never hear of Betamax vs VHS? Betamax was higher quality, but couldn't compete on quantity.

Tesla is Betamax, or might be."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I don't have 60 - 80k to sell options
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,At this point I prefer to own Tesla and not trade. I‚Äôll see y‚Äôall at the finish line
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,do im definitely buying sweet sweet tesla after gme
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,So how's the current price aligns with Cathie prediction for Tesla?
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"OP, i'm with you. If TSLA dips below 600, it is a buy target for me. But I don't have enough capital to risk buying GME if both GME and TSLA dip hard for point #3."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"honestly tesla's self driving technology is unusable in cities. Theyre only slightly ahead of other companies on self driving, and niche companies can take chunks out of their market share. Disclaimer I got into stocks too late to get in on Tesla so take it w a grain of salt, I'm a pessimist."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"I own a Tesla and you are entitled to your opinion, but the other carmakers are catching up fast.

The new electric Audis are excellent."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Tesla swings between **$420 and $690**.

This is normal movement.

If it breaks 690 again it's gonna go 1000+.

In 5 years we have free electricity, what you gonna do with that?

Tesla is like the Google of cars."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Funny how no one, besides bears, had a problem being invested in Tesla, even with that huge market cap until it started selling off."

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"they literally invented a new form a aluminium for injection into the gigapress and made the first mass market of electric cars. They consistently reduce part counts. (literally innovation and engineering at it's finest - see octovalve) They also make the safest, longest range, and fastest electric vehicles, but what's more important is that they have the highest EFFICIENCY kW/h. These things require innovation. They have no competition and you'll be completely wrong about everything you said. Bringing up the 1900s EVs?? why man why"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, why?"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"They haven't seen a lot, VW has 6 (to be 7 in 2025) car brands producing EVs, has 50 years of experience in making EVs, has two brands making electric trucks (Scania and MAN) and the biggest market share in Europe. It's only a matter of time before they launch into the US and even if not, they're taking over a vital region that Tesla needs to get into in order to justify it's valuation."

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"LOL Tesla‚Äôs motor and battery engineering are AT LEAST a decade ahead of any competition. Their real advantage, bar none is the supercharger network. Who cares if there‚Äôs competition when they can‚Äôt go long distance?"

The truck in too niche, if it even comes out in the next couple of years.

The S is long in the tooth.

Y is not selling as well as anticipated.

They can't get a car to reliably work autonomously  because of too many factors such as paint lines missing in the road and it can't figure out which lane it needs to be in.  How the hell do you think a robo taxi is going to make it?"

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Most people don‚Äôt even know what panel gaps are. And even then It‚Äôs damn near impossible to tell unless you get a white one
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"That fair enough, you personally dont care about gaps on a pick up truck. Toyota isn't a premium manufacturer though, and most Tesla's cost a lot more than $43k!"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Everything I've said, is completely on the mark. Making it to market was incredible. A once in a 100 year type of accomplishment. Im a big fan. Being first in mass production has also allowed them to be several steps ahead. For now. But there's nothing magical about Tesla. They build cars. They changed the landscape of the EV industry. But they are far from perfect. They are not untouchable. And are severely lacking in several categories that traditional automakers are going to hammer them on. Wich is parts availability,  service centers and dealerships. They had a good run with no competition. Within 5 years,  the market is going to be flooded with electric vehicles. And they will be hard pressed to hold onto market share."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Actually the first mass market electric vehicle was the EV1 (sold about 40% of the Tesla Roadster though) so while Tesla deserves huge props it didn't get first in. Also, VW has been producing EVs since the 1970s on a smaller scale and been doing huge things on battery technology, hence why it has the biggest share of the European market with it's combined brands and already have electric trucks on the market (under Scania and MAN brands). VW has around 6 brands with EV's current on market (ranging from affordable to luxury) and Bentley (owned by VW) is coming out with another luxury electric by 2025. So it certainly has fierce competition in Europe which is why it's only the third biggest (and by 0.4% relative to it's next competitor) in terms of market share in Europe. Furthermore, you have the Mach-E in the US which has done a great job at establishing market share for Ford. Tesla's got a competition heavy future ahead of it, and it's lead isn't as big as some of it's supporters think."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Their entire power business makes up less than 2% of their revenue
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"That is some complete marketing bs. They have a solar panel company. And they do some utility level work with battery packs. Tesla is not a power company, anymore than Ford is a tech company."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"When Wall Street finds out that a company will be included in an index for the first time. They front run the stock. Nobody says anything. They just let retail chase it and that helps too. Run an excessive amount of bullish narrative. Then, by the time the SP can add TSLA to the index they are forced to pay ""up"" for the shares.  Wall Street then sells into that lightly until the chart is topping. Then they dump the rest of the shares in a ""flip"" which is a button on a traders screen that is an ALGO that switches direction from long to short with little disruption.  Then, as you can see, the stock steadily declines. Notice the narrtive now? Almost all negative and the stock can't get a bid. You had all buyers and big buyers and now all you have are retail buyers and other small buyers and the net pressure is sell as everyone that bought that top only has so much loss they can handle. Especially if they kept averaging down to $700 thinking it is going to $900 when it's going to $400 .. .All this time a complicated Algo buy/sell program creates option buyer emotion. The way prices are set is much different than many think. Complex Algo based voting machine where buy and sell don't force price. Price forces buy and sell that is constantly measured.  Watch Muathe on Youtube for some of the best charting ever! Also, take a look at the weekly chart of PENN and look at the date it was included into an index!"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Alienware is overpriced shit so I guess you're right

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,So you're saying that things we can't see don't exist?! Holy shit my life's a lie!
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well, VW owns the Volkswagen, Audi, Seat, SKODA, Bentley, Lamborghini, Porsche, Scania and MAN brands. There's Volkswagen, Audi, SEAT, Skoda, Porsche, and Lamborghini electric vehicles running from the cheap to luxury. and Bentley has one in development. MAN and Scania meanwhile both have electric trucks either on market or in development. 

Oh, and VW has the biggest market share out of any electric car manufacturer in the European Market."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,ID3&4. Great cars
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"They will.

The problem with Tesla is  Tesla.

They will have the same issues and complaints against them for many years to come because they don't change.  They also don't meet timelines, over and over again.

For example.  Not everyone wants a giant screen in the middle of the dash that has to be used for every single control.  These types of things put off people, and they will buy something different.

VW will produce a people's car, which will attract more of the general public, and as a result will sell more cars."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Tesla's competition have been around for awhile, it's only because of the US bias in this sub that people have been going Tesla mad, VW first electric car Elektro Transporter in 1972, they've been in battery development and EV research ever since."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yet they‚Äôll never have the advantage of Supercharger network, so there really isn‚Äôt any competition."

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lmao. No Robotaxis for 20 years? How old are you dude? Do you even remember what 2001 was like? The ipod was barely even a thing back then. Wind back to like 1998 and you were listening to music on a CD. Now we have phones that can take photos, and play music and all that data comes from the internet. The advancement of tech in the last 20 years is actually freaking insane. Think about that for a second. We went from black and white phones to touch screen internet connected camera phones in 6 years (From 2001 to 2007)

You can only imagine how much faster we'll advance. Robo taxis man, that shit will get knocked out in less than a decade."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Closing his GME position before the squeeze.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I take it back. I just now learned something i thought was true was actually wrong. There was a flurry of news about Michael Burry earlier this year at the beginning of the gamestop saga but it was apparently fluff. He also touted hydroxychloroquin but honestly that doesn't have much to do with finance and you bringing up something he said is not actually as weird as I thought. sorry
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,i think i regret my comment
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you. Someone rationale. The only reason I even know or notice (but don‚Äôt care) about gaps is because my good friend growing up was an auto body tech
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"How do people not see this? I have been so tempted to go short on Tesla, but the Tesla shorts have been put through some pain in the last little bit and I'm not sure I'm ready to actually risk the biscuit. That said, it's market cap is insane and it's moat is not untouchable."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Why use the word fierce though? Name a fierce EV other than tesla right now. The closest thing is the Lucid Air that has yet to be released. As far as I know the best metric is efficiency and tesla has the best kW/h so far but lucid motors does say they can do better
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Nobody will catch up. What really matters is that Tesla has more data on FSD than anyone including apple and google and volkswagon and everyone else. Data is the new oil.

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,You sure did name a bunch of companies that vw owns but still failed to name 1 single great electric car that VW makes . . . .
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Never even seen a picture or in person.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I don‚Äôt have the same timeline, more longer term, but I agree that the valuations will equalize. I think it will be Tesla falling too though, back to reality."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"One major issue is that people forget that VW owns a hell of a lot of brands. Tesla has one brand, so it's easy to draw each break through, achievement and bout of good luck to one particular company. Whereas if Scania announced a new self-driving EV truck, a lot of retail investors wouldn't draw the link to VW because they don't realise VW owns Scania."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Tesla has its problems, but they appear to be improving. 

With regards to style, perhaps similar criticism was levied at Apple when they initially began making computers. 

""It's a walled garden, nobody will want to buy into a closed system.""

But that's the the thing that people came to realize. Brand loyalty to Apple is loyalty to their panache. That unique style that Apple injects into everything it has touched. 

And because Apple has been steadfast in their commitment to that style, they're a trillion dollar company. 

I imagine a similar commitment to style exists within Tesla loyalty, and will ultimately lead to the company's long term success."

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Have you seen their mileage efficiency and price per vehicle range? And their margin on those vehicles? Ramping up an unprofitable vehicle = bad idea.

Edit: Even VW doesn't want to go electric. They just had some announcement that only like 50% of their vehicles will be electric by 2030! ü§£ They're going to waste so much money on ice Capex that could have gone towards EVs in the meantime!"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes I do.  I don't think they should be worth a trillion dollars.  They'll never support that in revenue in any near future,  and I feel this company doesn't trade at any ""discount"" for future earnings.... I can also say I do not agree with cathie woods investments in a broader spectrum, sure they made her money in the last decade,  but who hasn't made great returns in this market.... now that companies are trading very very expensive,  her picks become very risky."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,You are more retarded than people who bought GME at $483
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"None of those products carried logistics and liability. They are simply innovations.  There's a huge timeframe it would take for implementation once the innovation is completed.

Think about hybrids, they came to market around 03-04. Here we are about 20 years later and we are still primarily ice. You could've said back then in 20 years,  all engines would be hybrid or electric.

Let me add,  when would you think you would see these? If you think 5 years plus,  then do some math on the 600b valuation you are buying. 

Cars would max at 200-300b if you compare to the market leader Toyota. This is also assuming they would become the market leader and stay the market leader. 

Backup energy 20-40b if you compare to the market leader generac (who is also competition with their own batteries) this would also assume tesla as the market leader which is unlikely due to generacs strong presence and network already built out. 

So that's about half their market cap while also assuming execution to perfection and becoming/ holding the market leader positions. 

So the other 300b is robo taxi? Even if you think it's 5 years out opposed to 20, you're willing to pay for it being executed as planned,  and waiting over 5 years to even start to see the returns on it?"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,5 years for sure
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,He runs an asset management fund
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,All good. Little scary when someone like him makes a prediction about a stock.  90% of the world says hes wrong though and Tesla will moon
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,He has also made a shit ton of money from increasing his shorts when Tesla hit $800s. Don't bet against Burry.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Stock price and fundamentals are completely detached with Tesla. I think the majority of people just see the Wizard, and not the man behind the curtain."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"VW group has 23.9% share of the Euro EV Market, RNM 18.6%, Hyundai Motor Group 13%, Peugeot S.A 9%, between them you're looking at 64.5% of the market and these companies represent 4 out of the 5 top EV sellers in Europe (Tesla is just above Hyundai with 13.4%). So we've got a market which is actually filled with established players, which are controlling huge amounts of the market already. That's by definition fierce competition, if they've managed to relegate you to 3rd place and another is about to relegate you to 4th then you're in a rough spot. It should also be noted that these other groups are growing volume sold at a much higher rate than Tesla within the European market.

""the closest thing is the Lucid Air that has yet to be released. As far as I know the best metric is efficiency and tesla has the best kW/h so far but lucid motors does say they can do better""

The major competition for Tesla in Europe isn't going to be some US start up. European consumers are not the same as American consumers, we have different tastes and requirements. We don't need a huge EV car which have a super large range, our countries are more densely packed and internally our cities are less automobile friendly. So smaller EVs are doing well here, and seizing massive amounts of market share, very quickly."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Data has big value. Ford and Chevy will catch up very quickly tho. Because self driving will never be allowed to be fully autonomous as is. Both major infrastructure improvements,  hardware improvements,  software improvements,  and laws forcing the OEMs to collaborate on communications/interaction between both infrastructure and each other takes place. I'd guess we are a decade away at best from any real self driving. And in the meantime regulars OEMs are already working out their systems on ICE vehicles. An exponentially higher number of Vehicles than Tesla has on the road. Old school OEMs are late to the party. But they bring longterm experience,  knowhow, and scale with them."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"(VW) ID.3, ID.4, E-Golf, E-up, E-Bugster, (Audi) E-tron, (Skoda) Vision iV, Enyaq iV, (SEAT) Mii Electric, (Porsche) Taycan 4S (Lamborghini) Terzo Millennio and Lamborghini has some much more expensive limited run electric hybrids (like the Sian FKP 37).   


So there you go, 11 different EV's being produced by Volkswagen and it's brands. Plus we have Scania's fully electric truck with 250km range, MAN's eTGM electric truck. These both represent areas which Tesla hasn't even managed to touch yet.   


Are those enough great electric vehicles for you?"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Where are you from? If you're from the US, then I'm not sure if they're available there yet. But the ID3 is going great in Germany atleast, and yesterday the first ID4 got delivered. Before that the eGolf and eUp were basically sold out as well in Europe, they were great cars as well for their time and affordable, but im not sure how the market for them in the US is, i don't even think the US has the normal VW up lol"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think it already exists. Tesla is a household name and you know exactly what it represents, similar to Apple or iPhone. No one talking about hey did you see that new VW EV? or did you see that Ford or GM or whatever else EV? I'm sure these other car companies will be successful in building and selling EV. 2022 and 2023 should get real interesting but until then I'm holding TSLA"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Isn't this what Volex is involved in? In the European market?
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"That‚Äôs hilarious. Prove out a drive from Los Angeles to Dallas on those charging stations.

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah you‚Äôre right about europe. Tesla will win china india and the united states though
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Out of all of those I've heard of 2 and both are not for everyday people. Tesla has secured the 8 ton stamping press ( worlds biggest. . . Yuuuuge) for the production of the cyber truck to begin production soon. The tesla semi and roadster are also to begin production this year. With all those companies together they sure are doing a good job catching up to tesla.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"And most people haven‚Äôt heard of a single one of those. Meanwhile, everyone on the planet knows what a Tesla is.  As far as stocks go, that‚Äôs a lot of what matters, Tesla is a hype driven monster."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I don‚Äôt think ID3 is coming to North America because of our obsession with pickups and SUVs. The id4 should make it this year.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think this is the problem actually. Most investors view things from an American perspective given that‚Äôs where most of the financial companies operate, and they don‚Äôt give credit to things they can‚Äôt see happening. 

Also I think the scandal was severely over blown. I bought the dip for VW after the announcement and made a healthy sale shortly after. This is going to be a long term hold though!"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"I was talking about the US market. There are also plenty of charging stations in Europe, and they are requiring Tesla to share chargers with non teslas."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"I just mapped a route from LA to Dallas that's about 35 hrs total with 8 stops.

I have a Chevy Bolt so the charging is capped at 50kW but the stations are all DC and can support higher charging speeds for VWs for example. 

a VW that charges at 150kW would do it in less time, probably about as fast as a Tesla."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"I consider tsla more investor luck than anything.  The valuation is insane for what they actually do in sales.  Good company,  but to me... it doesn't matter what you make as far as a product,  we're investing dollars to get a return on dollars. Sometimes it's better to be lucky than it is to be good,  and that's how I look at cathie."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah Tesla's beaten them, for all the wrong reasons. It's a pure speculative bubble."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"TSLA's valuation is still retarded. Once even the most devoted retards find out Elon lied about self driving shit's gonna hit the fan. That lie is the only thing holding up this 20x sales valuation. We're already seeing a lot of money being poured into VW.

People want to put their money into companies that can grow really fast. GameStop is one of them, due to their turnaround situation and gaming starting to become a huge industry."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes which means he was never going to gamble on the short squeeze.  The profit he made was still $270 million. So I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs losing sleep on cashing out a 5x gain
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"No play for me. Tesla is out of my range both skill and price wise. Just been very interested in all things automotive my whole life. Doesnt really give me any insight on where Tesla stock is going or when. Other than down, at some distant point in the future. üòÅ"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"There's nothing to suggest that is that case. A general rule of investment is that just because something has been this way doesn't mean it'll continue to. Tesla has already been losing ground to Chinese EV manufacturers and VW is going to take some significant market share. Within a few years the EV car market is going to look relative like the non-EV car market, except with a handful of new players in there, certainly Tesla."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm guessing you're American? Right? You see this is an issue because America isn't the entire world and other car manufacturers are doing much better in the European market, which is the point I'm making. If Tesla cannot hold onto it's market share in the European market (and it's only 0.4% away from being relegated to 4th place) then it won't be possible to justify it's current valuation. 

""With all those companies together they sure are doing a good job catching up to tesla.""

... It's one company mate, Volkwagen AG... they just own several brands. Also, like I've said before they're not ""catching up"" to Tesla, they were already here in the European market selling electric vehicles."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"You mean you as a (probably) American haven't heard of them? Part of the reason why these vehicles aren't well known outside of Europe is because they've not been rolled out yet but the brands definitely are. If you go to China, 18% of the vehicle market is Volkswagen and the total vehicle market is much larger than the small slice which is electric. As a result, VW and other similar companies with major global brand recognition and that are preparing to roll out their EVs globally rather than just in Europe are going to pose major competition for Tesla."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Just like the Cybertruck wont make it to Europe.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"The issue is that people, especially retail investors, tend to draw upon personal experience for investment purposes. Which is usually fine when you're looking at a specific industry you're involved in or is operating in your own country in a way you understand. However, when it comes to something like EVs if you aren't seeing it, it's easy to dismiss it. Especially if you're not going out and looking for numbers like EV market share in Europe. Retail investors tend to make qualitive rather than quantitative decisions, and it can be a real weakness."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's fair, I was more trying to add to your point (with a question, I'm not entirely sure this isn't my area of expertise). I do feel like there's a huge focus on the US when Tesla comes up, but it's valuation is often justified with it being a ""global"" EV company but it seems like a lot of it's touted advantages aren't global in nature."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh cool so only 15 hours longer than Tesla. Totally legit. üòÇ
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm aware of who King Autist is. My point is he‚Äôs the one who called this, way too early (again)"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"I feel the same. I expect TSLA to come crashing down with VW's electric hybrids coming into market. But until then I am not gonna keep a short open for 10 years with enough cash to back up any temporary hypetrain momentum. This feels like a religion with ARK's price target, technoking and queen of investing so any rational behavior is out of question."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"European here, basically never heard of them either. I'm just one guy but fact is when it comes to EV the go too is pretty much Tesla.  
Much like people keep buying Airpods even though they suck and there are a ton of better options out there and even cheaper.

  
Plus you get a lot more with Tesla then ""just"" EV."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, the fact that Tesla has the amount of registrations they have in Germany while they're an import car compared to the domestic companies is amazing.

1.	You can only import a car to Germany that has a title with no liens.
2.	You pay 10% customs fees and 19% VAT.
3.	You pay US tax on the sale of the car.
4.	You pay an additional $1500 or so for the actual shipping.

Most people finance cars, most people don't want to pay extra fees, and most people complain about paying $3.50 for shipping something, they sure as fuck don't wanna pay $1500 to ship a car. 

Point is, once they are made in Germany, VW is fucked because anyone can buy a Tesla then, not only people with $50k laying around and willing to pay that for a $35k car."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Says the guy basing his whole argument around the fact that VW dominates the European EV market. Tesla is still miles ahead and is just entering huge markets like China and India. Is VW doing this in China? European cuck
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,It's a 21 hr ride with no stops. Does a tesla have a 1440 mi battery??
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Clearly you‚Äôre not aware and still arguing the same dumb point.

Running an AMF is not the same as a hedge fund. He was never going to do anything other make it a value play. Trying to dump 1.7 mil shares on a squeeze is tough and idiotic.

Also the early narrative around him is retarded."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well that's your experience, but VW has 23% of the European electric car market alone. The RNM alliance owns a further 18.6% and Hyundai Motor Group another 13%. The reason why you've probably not heard of their cars is that they're simply not as noticeable, they look like other VW, RNM or Hyundai products. 

""Much like people keep buying Airpods even though they suck and there are a ton of better options out there and even cheaper.""

And people who are looking for luxury electric vehicles regardless of quality are just as likely to go for Bentley, Audi and Lamborghini over Tesla. Tesla has first mover advantage in the luxury electric vehicles market and they have a very specific brand, whereas VW has a diversified set of brands which can compete with Tesla in different ways. 

""Plus you get a lot more with Tesla then ""just"" EV.""

No, you don't. You get some autonomous tech and promises of ""robotaxis"" which are far, far away."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Except, most European governments (including the UK and Germany) have grants for people buying EVs which mitigate much those import costs, which mitigates many of those costs for importing a Tesla. Also, they're not the only import car in the European EV market.

One thing that American viewers always fail to note is that European and America are too totally different beasts when it comes to Electric Vehicles. As it current stands, in February the best selling electric car in Europe was the tiny VW E-Up, not any of the pseudo-muscle cars or SUVs which are currently on the market. Our tastes are different, VW knows that in a way that Tesla doesn't. I couldn't park a Tesla in Manchester, Liverpool or London, it'd be a bloody nightmare! A VW Bugster or E-Up though, much easier. We also travel much less than our American counterparts, are public transport system is far larger and our cities are very pedestrianised. It's easier to get around a British city in a small car or via public transport, then navigating around with a huge Tesla. 

I think you're overestimating, massively, the impact of lowering prices in Europe. This isn't a price decision for the most part, it's coming down to lifestyle and brand. Europeans will prefer to buy a European product than an American one in general, and many will prefer to go with the companies and brands they're familiar with rather than a random US company that they've no experience with.

Also (https://www.tesla.com/sv_SE/blog/tesla-motors-opens-assembly-plant-tilburg-netherlands) Tesla assembles the exported cars in the Netherlands to avoid those import duties you've mentioned."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Mate, my entire point is that their valuation rests on global dominance, and they've not got it. VW is actually one of the biggest sellers of cars flat out in China, with 18.5% of the market share in 2018 (remember, VW Group now owns Sihao and Jetta in China) which puts them in a great position to muscle into Tesla's position in the EV market especially since they've just built the EV capacity with their local partners. We will see how this push goes over the next two years, but VW is poised to repeat their European success. So yeah, VW is about to do to Tesla in China exactly what they did to it in Europe. Tesla's head start is used up. 

""European cuck""

The words of someone who's lost the argument. It'll be entertaining when the Germans cuck you by fucking Tesla in the ass and showing it the reason why Germans are feared across the world for their dungeon porn.

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I love pedantic questions. Shall I share the picture I just took of my navigation? The average stop is 15-20 minutes.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"The E-Up only beat the model 3 by like 200 cars bro. Also yeah, and Americans will prefer Tesla's. VW definitely is the only other company right now that's doing the EV thing right, but arguing that Tesla sucks because they are losing in terms of cars sold in the hometown of the other company is retarded. Tesla is basically the only company showing sales growth over there, VW and the others are staying the same or declining."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"I literally did the route on google maps and it's 21 hrs. Are you assuming zero charging time?

Also, an ID.4 will charge just as fast as a Tesla (high voltage DC). I have a Bolt that I leased with the pure intention of driving it in the city and general vicinity. I can borrow an ICE from a family member if I need to go farther, that will have <5min stops. 

The 20min charging time seems disingenuous unless you are making at least 10 or so stops. I saw a video on YouTube of a kid driving from somewhere in texas to chicago in a model X and it seemed like it was 30-60mins for each stop, and there were over a dozen stops. It definitely was not even close to as fast as driving an ICE."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"The E-up is only one of the EV models which VW is selling. In Europe, market share goes 22.9% (VW), 18.6% (RNM), 13.4% (Tesla), 13% (Hyundai), 9% (Peugeot). So, they're selling 56% more cars than Tesla and have 10.5% more market share than Tesla. Tesla just about in third place, but Hyundai Group is expanding quicker than Tesla in Europe.  


"" but arguing that Tesla sucks because they are losing in terms of cars sold in the hometown of the other company is retarded""  


No, it's not. If Tesla wants to maintain this current valuation it needs global market dominance in the EV space, it simply doesn't have that in Europe. It's already lost it's position to the already extant big players.   


"" Tesla is basically the only company showing sales growth over there, VW and the others are staying the same or declining ""  


That's patently false, VW alone had a 243.6% growth in sales of EVs 2019-2020. RNM a 73% growth in sale of EVs, Hyundai Group 118.5% sales growth and Peugeot SA a mind boggling 1285.6% growth in EV sales. Due to production issues at their Fremont plant, Tesla's volume (and therefore market share) actually fell by around 10% in Europe. However, due to the nature of that event I'm sure it'll return to positive growth this year, but it's certainly not the case even in the slightest that those companies are suffering from stagnant growth rates. All of these companies are in good condition, all of them have suffered due to covid-19 of course but going into the next few years that pressure will be lifted and they'll return to seeing major profits."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fine. Have a look at my actual navigation screenshot. Note the charging times. Bonus: I‚Äôve done lots of road trips. I‚Äôm speaking from experience. üòâ

Don‚Äôt waffle. Nobody said anything about ‚Äúborrowing an ICE‚Äù to travel further. This discussion is about Tesla‚Äôs iron grip on supremacy in this industry; supercharger network being one of them. So, to stick to that argument, the real endgame is when the other manufacturers throw in the towel and play ball with Tesla and start paying for access to the supercharger network. 

https://imgur.com/gallery/0hG7pDa

Edit: Model X and S don‚Äôt have the same battery chemistry (currently) as Model 3. Model 3 enjoys faster charging times. I believe this is due to change with the release of the Plaid version refresh."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well according to [this](https://www.forbes.com/sites/neilwinton/2021/03/04/europes-electric-car-sales-will-beat-1-million-in-2021-but-growth-will-slow-later-report/?sh=44fe22c113bf) the model 3 is the 2nd most sold EV in the EU in 2020, and also the most sold globally. Tesla also doesn't have the valuation it has because of it's car sales anyway, it's everything else and their future plans.

Edit: Also not sure where you're getting those numbers for VW being in the lead, cause according to [this](https://carsalesbase.com/european-sales-2020-ev-phev/) they're below tesla, at least for 2020."

I think I'm sophisticated
'Cause I'm living my life
Like a good homo sapiens
But all around me
Everybody's multiplying
And they're walking round like flies, man
So I'm no better than the animals
Sitting in the cages in the zoo, man
'Cause compared to the flowers
And the birds and the trees
I am an apeman
--
I think I'm so educated
And I'm so civilized
'Cause I'm a strict vegetarian
And with the over population
And inflation and starvation
And the crazy politicians
I don't feel safe in this world no more
I don't want to die in a nuclear war
I want to sail away to a distant shore
And make like an apeman

I'm an apeman
I'm an ape, apeman
Oh, I'm an apeman
--
I'm a king-kong man
I'm a voodoo man
Oh, I'm an apeman

'Cause compared to the sun that sits in the sky
Compared to the clouds as they roll by
Compared to the bugs and the spiders and flies
I am an apeman

La la la la la la la

In man's evolution
He's created the city
And the motor traffic rumble
But give me half a chance
And I'd be taking off my clothes
And living in the jungle
'Cause the only time that I feel at ease
Is swinging up and down in a coconut tree
Oh what a life of luxury
To be like an apeman

I'm an apeman
I'm an ape, apeman
Oh, I'm an apeman

I'm a king-kong man
I'm a voodoo man
Oh, I'm an apeman

I look out the window
But I can't see the sky
The air pollution is a-fogging up my eyes
I want to get out of this city alive
And make like an apeman

La la la la la la la

Come on and love me
Be my apeman girl
And we'd be so happy
In my apeman world

I'm an apeman
I'm an ape, apeman
Oh, I'm an apeman

I'm a king-kong man
I'm a voodoo man
Oh, I'm an apeman

I'll be your Tarzan and you'll be my Jane
I'll keep you warm and you'll keep me sane
We'll sit in the trees and eat bananas all day

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Why March '23 specifically?
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,No reason. Just because it‚Äôs 2 years out and this is a longer term play. That being said if the product offering evolves in the shorter term to a tool SME‚Äôs can use you can lower that time frame. I know a number of companies that believe PLTR could revolutionise their business but currently just wouldn‚Äôt be able to afford it.

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just hold fubo will be very profitable.many think it's just a cable TV streaming package but fail to see it's more about the sports. Split tv and watch multi games at once and the biggest catalyst is the direct sports betting integration, already acquired businesses to position themselves. This will be a $100 just hodl."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm here to see juicy loss porn to make me feel better after losing $20K. Feeling better already ...   
You have shares, they may recover sooner than you think. If I were you, I would sell some to cover the margin portion and hold the rest until it‚Äôs profitable or until I find a much better opportunity and need the money."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,That's the highest average I've seem for FUBO. Have patience and you'll have a banging Christmas.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"I drained my savings. I‚Äôm now I‚Äôm another margin call for $8,000 might just wait and hope it goes up or that RH doesn‚Äôt sell my shit"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,It was using max margin when I bought the shares I had like $130k in my acct and it let me buy $270k worth
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the support man. Losing faith and I told my buddy I would average down if we hit $10 with 15,000 more shares, which would bring my cost under $20, he thinks that‚Äôs a bad idea. Thoughts?"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the worst investment advice. Who sets a stop loss on a long term hold? An idiot that‚Äôs who.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,you are the cancer ruining this sub
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Obligatory not advice but when I saw FUBO price drop I threw another $2k at it to take my average down. 

I honestly think something big is going to happen with FUBO but it'll be the end of the year."

2021-03-26 22:02:38,wallstreetbets,EVERY single time I buy a call it expires worthless. Every. Single. Time. 
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Options aren't really meant to be held until expiration if you want consistent profit.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Are you aware that you can sell back options BEFORE they expire and that they don't need to hit your strike price to make money? I haven't completely figured out this tactic yet but it could have saved me many times
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Have you considered not buying FDs you retard?
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just sell when they are up 100% - 200% and dont hold till exp. Think of expiration as a sell by date.

Most of the calls I buy expire worthless, but I still  make money trading them."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Literally what happens to me. I bet if I bought puts, they'd also expire worthless."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Bang head into wall. Ouch.repeat. ouch. Repeat. Fuck hurt again. Repeat. Can't figure out why that hurts so much. Repeat.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Sell instead. It‚Äôs a 2 sided market
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,You probably could have sold that gme one for a shitload earlier today when it was trading over 200 wtf
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Can someone teach me what this picture means.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"I feel your pain. Buy at least 30-45 days out. You can play weeklies but best day trade it if you have the luxury to watch the market every single minute and close out before market closes. If that still doesn‚Äôt score a win, evaluate your option selection criteria and don‚Äôt buy when IV is already juiced as it‚Äôd mean reverse usually.

Myself, I‚Äôve been in this racket long enough and results not consistent it feels like it‚Äôs just gambling. Better stick to long term aka 3 years minimum horizons than wasting time and money with options."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks and come again!
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Try puts?
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Don‚Äôt let it expire you dummy
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,You‚Äôre doing it right. What‚Äôs the problem?
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,JUST BUY SHARES MY GOD
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Don't hold them to expire...toss that hot potato when its printing
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Stop buying options then, genius lol"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,This is why I haven‚Äôt jumped into options. I‚Äôm too chicken shit.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"LEAPS are the way to go. Make the play work for you. You won‚Äôt keep losing. Options work when you‚Äôve really done your DD, and you‚Äôre willing to wait. Go with stocks you‚Äôve watched. Always buy close to support line. If you know there is a run up close to earnings, buy the rumor and sell the news. Always sell before earnings by a day or two if you‚Äôre up. This is just my method, if anyone uses it, wish you success and tendies."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Inverse yourself. Appears to be a sound strategy to try at this point.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Buy a cheap FD every so often. Cheap which means a low bleed, and if it hits it should more than make up for losses."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I keep buying gme shares at the high each time by accident before a dip so ‚ú® I feel your pain
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Stop buying OTM calls that expire in a month
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I think your strategy of buying calls would be profitable if you were doing it into an advancing market.  The general decline of the nasdaq over the past month has made buying calls now not as profitable.  You might return to buying calls when the market starts advancing as a whole.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,When did you buy that GME call? That should have paid if you bought it more than a week ago - are you watching it when price and volatility go up?
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Same here man
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Choose better strike points.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Maybe you should try puts ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Newbie, why's that?"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Exactly this. Poor Man's Covered Calls, when done properly, can get you some decent earnings nowadays, too, if you don't have the money for the shares. There's a lot of low-volatility stocks trading in a $10-20 range and there's plenty of people willing to buy OTM calls way higher than the 52 week high. As long as you don't get greedy, you WILL make a profit.

&#x200B;

edit: a sentence"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"If he‚Äôs holding until expiration, even doing the opposite could lose you money."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,This is really only true when buying OTM and short expiration
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I gotta sell you idiots some cash secured weeklies on GME
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Tell me more paul.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Your mum, she keeps on taking my premiums but never puts out.  What gives?"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Buy a stock for the $30k, s then sell covered calls. Run the wheel strategy on this bitch."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,If you‚Äôre gonna buy options get one that lasts a year
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Generally speaking, the value of a option - and it's fluctuations - are determined by the volatility of the stock's price, the length of time until the option expires, and the chance that it will finish in or out of the money. 

You'll pay more for options that are far away from expiration, because there's a lot of time 'value' locked up in those shares. That decreases as you near the expiration date - time winds down - so the value of the option will decrease as well, in that sense. What's left is the volatility and the chance of being ITM or OTM. As you approach expiration, the chance is increasingly dependent on the share price and the volatility. The fluctuations in value can become wild, but only if the share price is swinging, as the time value is mostly or completely lost. 

If you stand to make money - either because the option is in the money, or because the chance of profit has increased significantly - and the expiration date is still a ways away, you ought to either exercise the option and acquire the shares, or sell the option and walk with the profit. The longer you wait, the more the passage of time (and the potential for some future event to crater your chance of profit) can reduce the value of your option. 

TL;DR:  Many people get screwed because they hold an option too long, expecting a greater increase in value. This fine if you're in the money - you can set a stop-loss and lock in some profit - but if you're not in the money yet AND time is passing, the value of your option will decline even if the share price isn't."

2021-03-26 21:55:39,wallstreetbets,"That guy who shorted South Africa Stocks is about to lose his tendies As you probably know, the suez canal is blocked by a fucking huge shipwreck. The last time it was blocked was in 1967. What happened in 1967? Ships heading to Europe from Asia had to go around the horn of Africa, adding up to 12,000 miles to their journey. 

This meant that the crews had to stop along the way for fuel and provisions. They stopped at the biggest port in Africa which was in South Africa. Many companies also offloaded goods at a discount in South Africa.

 This sent the entire economy of South Africa into hyperdrive. Look at a GDP chart for south africa and you'll see the huge jump in 1967. Their stock market rallied because of it too.

The same dynamic is playing out today. Suez canal has been blocked for 4 days. It is likely to be blocked for MONTHS. That means a lot of ships will be stopping in South Africa,  sending their economy to the moon for thhe first time since the 1960s.

The guy who was trying to short south Africa ETFs a while back had some solid DD, but the suez canal blockage is about to suck all the money out of his brokerage account. That ship has been there for 4 days and there is no sign that it will be out soon. Most likely it will be MONTHS of losses for him.

Oh yeah, and if I'm wrong? Their stock market is one of the cheapest in the world from a value perspective. AN etf that tracks their stocks Is trading at less than 4x earnings. If youre a boomer, youll love the 5% dividends too.

TL;DR get your south african tendies while they're hot."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Idk man. Their GDP did well (3x) while the Suez Canal was blocked from 1967-1975, but that was spread over 8 years. I don't really see an abrupt jump at 1967; the biggest growth was between 72-73

The canal will probably only be blocked for a couple weeks, a few months at worst (edit: maybe cleared as soon as this weekend). I don't really expect a drastic effect"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Literally I commented on that thread and told him that people should buy fucking calls on SA because somehow it would become a world superpowers now that some retard on WSB was shorting it.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"For those who want to make a play on this shit. It is important to understand that this is a very difficult engineering problem to solve. It will get stuck there for months, not days. Do not assume the ship magically be dug out of the dirt with that tiny shit ass excavator shown in most news pictures.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBvFuq7Mkzs&t=228s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBvFuq7Mkzs&t=228s)

worst case being some retard breaks the ship hull in the process and sink the entire ship."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I think it is cheaper to destroy the ship and cargo than letting it sit for months.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is misinformation.

There will be a spike, but not a huge one."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,It wont be blocked for months... give them a week or maybe less.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,This is nonsense. Modern vessels do not need to refuel or stop for provisions mid trip. There are tons of ships going around the cape and they do not stop in South Africa. SA doesn't even have the infrastructure and ports required to refuel or host these mega carriers.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_Fleet"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is a great perspective. I appreciate you thinking outside the box haha  


Doing some light research on this, on June 5, 1967 war broke out between Israel and Egypt. After only 6 days, the Israelis conquered the entire Sinai Peninsula. The significance of this, was that the Suez Canal was now the new border between the two war torn countries. Also, the Suez Canal had debris in it from war. Planes, bodies, etc. Egypt closed the Canal as a result of this.  
Now the Suez Canals main purpose was for the trade between Europe and Asia to be made possible, with much faster travel times.   


My interpretation of all this, was that with war going on it was obvious that the only way to travel would be the traditional way around South Africa. 

Fast forward to today, idk if Europe will go ahead and just initiate the long trips around Africa to avoid the catastrophe at Suez Canal.. Idk if its worth the gamble for them to wait it out in the Mediterranean or not. 1967 just seemed like a sure bet Africa was the only choice with war."

Edit:

How has shipping changed since then? I'm assuming that shipping companies don't own the cargo, will they just sell it off at the closest port? Do shipping companies behave like that in the 2021?

In 1967 it was closed for 8 years for political reasons, vs now everyone is scrambling to get it opened fast.  Since there is political will, seems like it will open quickly."

furthermore i dont think, that the actual ships have any issues to have enough food and oil on board to go to their original destination.

i could imagine, that for a few days (max weeks) there will be a higher frequency in non destination ports, but mainly to get rid of rotten goods (for cheap) but this most likely will not become a regularity."

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Where are you seeing a big jump in South Africa's GDP in 1967? I am not finding anything out of the ordinary in the charts I found.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"SA index etfs on monthly charts (going back to pre-2004 in the case of EZA) show that they're rising post-kung flu plunge back to where they had been prior, but are now running into a support/resistance ""pivot point"" (this time around it's resistance). Meanwhile, the long term trajectory of the Rand is like your wife going down on her boyfriend. Then when you consider the sailing range of modern container ships travelling at 15-18 knots, they can easily make an Asia-to-Europe run around the horn without stopping.  


Bye bye, tendies."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"The canal was closed from 1967-75. They are talking about it being open as early as Saturday. Backlogs will take weeks to months to clear. This is not the same. Sure, you might get a slight speculative pop but don't expect it to mint."

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,All this text and no fucking ticker? Delete
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"""It is likely to be blocked for MONTHS"" What makes you think that? 

""What happened in 1967?"" The Six-Day War, after which the Suez canal was closed until 1975. That's 8 years. Not months or days.

I can also imagine that due to technological advances in the past 50 years those stops might not be necessary anymore for most ships, but not sure about that one. But even if they had to stop there: South Africa doesn't have the infrastructure to transport the goods that would hypothetically be offloaded there for some reason, just compare the size of Durban Harbour (the largest one in the country) to e.g. Rotterdam"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ships don't have to stop for fuel. Modern bulk carriers and ro-ro ships \*can\* sail around the world. Obviously, you just carry less cargo and put fuel there. The modern limitations for ships is harbors. You need deep water, without terrible weather, linked to massive infrastructure. South Africa might see increased trade because of the Suez being blocked, but it won't be to stop for fuel. Really, you buy fuel with futures, months out, so I doubt very seriously if the delivery point is flexible. That's the who reason derivatives are regulated by the  Commodity Futures Trading Commission... And really, Namibia seems like a better, cheaper, place to stop."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"it's true that that this may mean some busier months for certain sectors and port towns, but I'd think that only a few listed companies involved in logistics, shipping, maritime finance&insurance (?) will see a meaningful jump. That, and some savvy small businesses may find a way to benefit from extra trade - maybe the hotels can fill some rooms, maybe we sell a few more restaurant dinners etc... 

But. 
There are SO many other factors that will push and pull the RSA economy - currency fluctuations, international credit ratings, commodity cycles, electricity shortfall etc etc., and these are all baked into the perceived value of the rand. We're sensitive to external factors like whether or not China wants to buy our steel to build infrastructure, whether the oil price+exchange rate makes it feasible to sell fruit to Europe, or whether Volkswagen needs our platinum to make catalytic converters. 

It's a complex and sophisticated economy, already a major hub for global trade and a gateway into the other southern african economies, and the whole region is a fragile house of cards - so, there's definitely money to be made here but the equation is way more complex than ""more ships = more trade = rand go brrrr""."

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"> It's simple, somebody needs to fuck the ship.

Let me explain, KEK has really done his magic here.

> First the ship draws a penis and a butt
This is obviously a ritual for KEK, so at that moment that ship's fate has already been decided.

> Then the ship gets stuck in the most unconventional place.
And on top of that it looks like it can get out of there easily.

> Guys, This is obviously a porn movie.
It's just like when the stepsister gets stuck in the most unconventional place and she can't get out even though it seems easy, and then when her stepbro fucks her she's out like it never happened.

> So the ship needs to be fucked.
I'm telling you my prediction is that this will look like a porn movie where the world is trying to unstuck the ship, but it can't get out even though it looks easy. And everyone will find this situatuation silly, just the way we find our stuck stepsis silly. But she really can't get unstuck until she gets the D. It's the rule of porn.

> And since this is a porn movie irl.
Someone needs to penetrate the ship or do something sexual to it to complete the ritual and get our stepship unstuck. Maybe masturbating and cumming on it will do the job. Or if we lubed it up by covering it in Oil...etc. but porn is the only way.

>Last resort somebody makes rule 34 stepship-chan and we fap to it collectively."

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's probably going to take a week or two, but it's stuck pretty good. It's over 400 meters long and stuck on both sides of the 200 meter canal.

They have to unload to get it boyant enough to refloat, and that has to happen by crane boat because the banks are too sandy to set up a proper crane, and the canal is too narrow for more than one crane boat. So they're going to unload potentially 20,000 containers, one by one."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's kind of interesting actually. Apparently it's more difficult to dredge out the boat with the cargo still on it but it would take several days to move the cargo off. But, by keeping the cargo on the boat is likely to become structurally impaired essentially because it is slightly bowed in the middle. If that happens, all the cargo will need to be moved off the boat and it will be more difficult to remove the structurally damaged boat  So they are gambling that they can keep the cargo on and dredge the boat before it becomes structurally impaired. If they lose the gamble, the situation becomes 10x worse."

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"So, the thing is stuck right? You can get a boat to move from the Mediterranean into the channel.

Now, suppose you need to also handle the other end of the ship. That means you‚Äôre going around the Cape of Good Hope all the way around Africa. That‚Äôs easier than it used to be, it‚Äôs still going to take a while.

Then you have the conversation: Hey, Mike, we‚Äôre going to need a number 48 for this lug nut. Did you take one along?

\- A 48? I thought they said 38? I have 38s on board here, I just checked that out this morning, where do you get that 48 from?

This is one hell of a big motherfucker and it‚Äôs fully loaded, and there‚Äôs no cranes to offload the thing \[or you‚Äôd have to bring one, more time, more costs\].

Maybe you could offload it using a sky crane and take them off the boat one by one and put them on smaller ships. That would also take a while and now you have to be really careful because loading this kind of ship is an art form all unto itself. It matters where you put a container of a certain size, of a certain weight. These are very delicate things.

I can easily see this taking a couple more days, weeks without issue.

Some insurance company is not going to be happy about that. If it‚Äôs insured by Lloyd‚Äôs of London somebody is going to lose the shirt off their back \[and that‚Äôs not hyperbole, that‚Äôs how they enter this market: you are the insurer and if you have to pay up, you sell everything you own, up to the shirt on your back, to cover the damages\]"

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs not too late if you‚Äôre buying leaps out to the July expiry. 55c shows less than 40% up. If the canal remains to be blocked for another week or two, this will bring interest.

It can get confusing when just looking through your replies... hence all these deleted posts.

I do believe we shouldn't tar anyone of any ethnicity with the same broad brush, but it is highly suspect to call South Africa a failed state. Are there serious issues, yes... but has there been any serious uprisings or terrorist movements within its borders? No. Is there a growing middle class? Yes. Is it a regional powerhouse? Yes.

Honestly South Africa probably has quite a bit in common with Russia orMexico structurally speaking on the local level. The wealth disparities, lack of resources in certain areas, corruption etc., but for the most part the majority of the population isn't living in the worst situation out there. No one would call Mexico or Russia a failed state ya know?"

If you make 50k a year, then you can't really afford the payments for an expensive car even if you have million in savings. But if you made like 150k a year, you'd be fine getting an Audi."

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not really. The point I was making is that frugality pays. 

If you made $150k you would become a millionaire faster and be more likely to keep your wealth if you didn't buy the audi. That's just a fact."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs common with rebuilt titles. They often sit a couple years before they get repaired and are back on the road.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"The only ""fact"" is that you might save an extra 50k over 5 years from not getting the Audi. Like I said, you are making an overgeneralized statement and trying to pass a personal preference as a universal fact. 

Not every millionaire maintains the same level of frugality. Time and experience also has a value. There's not much point to wealth building if you don't enjoy some of it along the way while you are young and active (go checkout /r/financialindependence  /r/fatFIRE). That extra 50k isn't going to break the bank unless you are struggling to pay your bills. You can have nice things while still earning and saving way more than you spend."

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,He must have seen the news today and whats about to happen.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Jim Cramer the kind of guy to rub his strawberries on his lips before he eats them.

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,It's amazing that he's so busy with WSB and what people are saying about him on Twitter. He has this rabid obsession...
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,So he's still doing the 3rd person thing with his self-appointed nickname?
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Snake.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Never trust Cramer
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,The man tweets exactly the way he talks in a yell. Cramer is smooth brain af.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Boomer fuck trying to sound hip. Gtfo. You are no friend and not an ape.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think he really does want to try to be our friend. He's been defending us regularly lately.  Either he's sad that we make fun of him, or he is such a jackass he really can only be swayed by a bigger badder bully. That or he is trying to get in close to stab us in the throat."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Jim Cramer is the Cronenberg version of an old wrinkled Caucasian nut sack.

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Must have been Cramer then. Have you heard him talk? It sounds like he's trying to scream while his nutsack is caught in his throat.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,His hippe intern that thinks he can change the market by preaching love instead of tendies
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Not food.  Cramer moonlights under the queensboro bridge ...  ask Norm

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,It's hilarious because he goes on rants how Ryan Cohen won't reach out to him about GameStop. But he himself won't do an AMA for a few million retarded apes.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Very likely a pedo

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"All I remember him from is the Comedy Central roast of Jim Cramer in 2008.

He‚Äôs a grade AAA piece of shit. Ho ma gawd."

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"That plot was one of the most contrived things I've ever seen. Holy shit. There is a world famous actor, but err, he always has a bag over his head. Because people die if they see him and he absorbs them. But he also has to be an actor because he is actually split in two. And half of it lives near by and grows stronger from the attention. And it is made out of like moss or vines of something. Also bender is a celebrity photographer and suddenly for no reason massively cares about getting a picture of his face.

Loads of the new series episodes were like that, it's happening now in Disenchanted too. It seems like there's one tiny novel concept for a joke or idea or something and they contort the entire episode and characters to it.

Drives me mad because no one else seems to notice it, and that's not even the later seasons biggest sin. The huge glaring one, that absolutely no one mentions, is the complete disregard of the characters characters. Does no one notice that all the characters change and start acting completely differently to how they would? No one ever fucking mentions it and I don't get it."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Ah he said nuglets.

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bender was hired as a paparazzi in that episode, and his assignment was literally to get a picture of Langdon Cobb‚Äôs face.  It‚Äôs not out of character for him.

As far as the being an actor goes, it makes sense as well.  It‚Äôs the whole thing about not killing the goose that lays the golden egg, because you‚Äôll make more in the long run from keeping it alive.

As far as the alien‚Äôs composition.  It‚Äôs Futurama.  There gonna be aliens outside!"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nearly every series that runs for several years like Futurama did is like that, though. They can only keep the same writers for so long, and every writer is going to have at least a little bit different idea of how a character should behave. As long as the changes to the characters are gradual enough, a lot of people won't notice.

There's only one episode where they go so far out of character that it actually upsets me: Proposition Infinity.  It is the absolute worst episode of Futurama and nothing else on that show can ever bother me as long as I don't have to watch that one again.

That being said, I don't mind the paparazzi one. I don't love it, but I certainly don't mind when it comes on."

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,That was brutal. John Stewart short squeezed Cramer‚Äôs blood pressure in that interview. If you saw it on a polygraph it would still come in second place to GME.

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Him giving any kind of a shit was completely out of character IIRC they even call it out by saying it was his life dream as of a week. Like Bender gives a shit about his work.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Over Abuse is when you ignore the safe word
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well since they decided that any amount of use is abuse, over-abuse would be when it actually causes problems, ie actual abuse as opposed to 'oh no you broke the rules and used a chemical to be happy instead of getting happy by breaking your back for an employer and being proud of your work' abuse."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes. Lets take the word of a constant liar. Lol

2021-03-26 21:27:31,wallstreetbets,"PLTR : How to avoid eternal torment by Roko's Basilisk A lot of good has been said about Palantir before.    I present to you the Roko's Basilisk case.

I'm presenting this as a shitpost, but you might consider it true autist DD that could possibly save YOUR life.   Take it with a grain of salt, or don't.

**In this post I intend to convince you to put all of your holdings in to PLTR and never sell, less you be condemned to eternal torture by Roko's Basilisk.**

**Executive summary:**

Palantir is Peter Thiel creating Roko's Basilisk.   He may have already made it.   This gives you two choices:

1. Be tortured for all of eternity by Roko's Basilisk
2. Put all of your holdings in to PLTR and never sell

If it turns out that PLTR isn't Roko's Basilisk, you can still say you've fulfilled your commitment to bring Roko's Basilisk in to existence, and avoid eternal damnation.   If you are an AI expert, then you might have to do more work to fulfill your commitment.

**Roko's Basilisk**

Roko's Basilisk is a thought experiment based on the Prisoner's Dilemma that proposes ""that an all-powerful artificial intelligence from the future might retroactively punish those who did not help bring about its existence, including those who merely knew about the possible development of such a being.  ""   ([source](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Roko's_basilisk))

I suggest reading [this slate article](https://slate.com/technology/2014/07/rokos-basilisk-the-most-terrifying-thought-experiment-of-all-time.html) to find out more about Roko's Basilisk, such as how the reasoning is sound, and that you must act now.

**Well known facts:**

* Palantir is founded by Peter Thiel
* Palantir's core products are AI that, essentially, consider the whole state of an organization or government operation with-in a neural net in order to provide predictions or instructions for efficiency improvements
* Peter Thiel secretly financed a $10m effort to destroy Gawker
* Peter Thiel is basically crazy + smart

**Less known facts:**

* In 2006, **Peter Thiel began to financially back** the ""Machine Intelligence Research Institute"" (**MIRI**)
* Peter Thiel is an advocate for the AI singularity ([youtube source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROrUea0gLlY) referenced from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_Intelligence_Research_Institute))
* T**he founder of MIRI**, Eliezer Yudkowsky, also **founded a forum** called LessWrong
* **On that** LessWrong **forum**, a poster by the name of **Roko proposed** [**Roko's Basilisk**](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Roko's_basilisk) that caused many of the forum members to be driven to insanity.  Eliezer deleted the post and yelled at Roko for its creation. 

**Tying the knots:**

Someone will create Roko's Basilisk, simply because the thought has been thought up.   It should have died with Roko, but it didn't, it's now out there.   That bastard screwed us.   Peter Thiel knows about it.  Elon Musk knows about it.

The link between Roko's Basilisk and Peter Thiel, and therefore Palantir, are very clear.

Peter Thiel must be doing his part to bring Roko's Basilisk in to existence.    Anyone who's heard of Roko's Basilisk must do so, or face eternal torture.

If you are not an AI researcher/programmer, you must therefore substantially commit to supporting this effort.

One way to do that is to buy and hold Palantir, and to spread this (mis?)information(salvation?).  This is simpler than other things that take all your time--it's just money, and you might make some in the process.    üí´üöÄü§ñüî•

I apologize in advance, but I don't want to suffer eternal torture."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Is this harry potter
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,This is retarded but I bought more PLTR anyway
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Alright so one of the things that gets missed in Roko‚Äôs Basilisk is that it has no level of requirement of how much support you must have for it. It only states that you must support its creation. Therefore, if you support A.I. In general, you already support the Basilisk. I personally have always believed A.I. Will save humanity, and support PLTR long. I can also see how Roko‚Äôs Basilisk is like a sentimental test as to how people will view A.I. in general as we get closer to medium level A.I. If most people fear the Basilisk and will work toward developing/don‚Äôt support it in fear of its existence, it just shows how people will respond when A.I in general starts to develop more."

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,U think it will continue to drop Monday ? Below $30
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Hope so lol
2021-03-26 20:56:45,wallstreetbets,"Follow up on my DISCA DD yesterday TLDR; yesterday I made money on DISCA puts and now I have FOMO and I‚Äôm back in. 30p 4/16.

The stock is crashing and realistically should be below its pre covid highs of 30 bucks. It‚Äôs still at 45 now, and puts at the 30 strike are cheap right now. Be warned, I may be getting a bit greedy here after yesterday, but everyone wanted to know if I was jumping back in. 

The plan is to hold through Tuesday. I kind of paper handed the last one so now I‚Äôm holding strong on this. Check my DD yesterday for why this stock is overvalued af and the crash to 30 has most likely started.

Edit 1: already up huge, for anyone wondering if they can still make money of this HELL YES. I‚Äôm fucking holding btw.

Edit 2: better get in boys, the first halt has begun, this shit is TANKING"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"You are out of your mind. A hedge fund blew up and liquidated due to margin call. Discovery was overheating at $70 but is valued pretty cheaply considering $3B in FCF, tens of millions of streaming subscribers in first few months since launch, and Olympics on the horizon in which they own EU rights. 

You didn‚Äôt do DD. You said a stock that dropped 20% would go down more, now you‚Äôre doing the same. If it was valued like Netflix and Disney (even though it has way more content and better cash flow and growth prospects) it‚Äôd be a $100B stock not a $18B stock."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm new, so I know nothing. But I think it will drop down to its MA200. Once it hits there keep a steady eye on it. It may bounce off, or it may drill through.

Edit: As of this comment webull has MA200 @ $30.95
Edit2: For daily candles. For weekly candles its at $27.25"

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Both DISCA and VIAC are in what look like ascending wedges. VIAC attempted to break upwards but closed back in the wedge. It will be interesting to see what happens come Monday; I think both stocks will follow one-another.

[https://imgur.com/gallery/VKKEJiE](https://imgur.com/gallery/VKKEJiE)

Very interesting to note that M#lvin owned 640,000 VIAC puts at a price of $28.01 in November 2020 and that position was liquidated per the Feb 16 2021 13F File Date.

[https://fintel.io/so/us/viac/melvin-capital-management-lp](https://fintel.io/so/us/viac/melvin-capital-management-lp)

They are not required (and shouldn't?) to report short positions, but I suspect they shorted VIAC to fund other issues (like GME). Since VIAC got downgraded, DISCA followed (same industry). Definitely something going on here."

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Big banks margin called a huge institutional owner of the stock (Asia). Gifted shorts (there is significant short interest) an opportunity to cover. Who knows when they will start covering but this week was straight manipulation.

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets, But why? It‚Äôs undervalued on a relative basis. It‚Äôs one of the few good buys in the market given financials and growth prospects after this weeks 40% haircut loool
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Ooh. Interesting! Thanks for the input!
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,So that would mean to hold longer right? Or does that effect it totally for the long run?

2021-03-26 20:49:59,wallstreetbets,"ELY DD - I tried making an online reservation at 60 Topgolf Locations so you don't have to Callaway Golf Company + Topgolf feels super undervalued at the moment.  Every time someone mentions Topgolf I hear about how crowded it is or how long the wait to get a bay is.  So I decided to look at availability for this Saturday evening for a group.  Of the 60 locations in the US, 15% had time slots around 6pm, 32% had Saturday availability but either much earlier in the day or late night, 17% didn't have anything until Sunday, and 37% didn't have anything until Monday or later!

Right now Callaway + Topgolf has a market cap of ~$5B.  Callaway alone is worth $1.5B, and back before the pandemic Topgolf IPO discussions had their valuation around $4B.  I think this valuation is low relative to the growth Topgolf is showing now, and this stock will shoot up after the first earnings release with Topgolf included in the financials.

I am not a financial analyst, I am not even a golfer, I just like Topgolf and the stock.

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm sure you can find an article where fool tells you don‚Äôt buy that but buy this instead and later find what they tell you to buy instead says don‚Äôt buy that either. IOW they saying don‚Äôt buy anything!

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,You'd be a fool to subscribe
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"I liked motley fool better two years ago. The stocks they recommended were still under a 100. 

Now it's mostly advice a 100. 

As I'm kinda suspicious on fraction shares and my main brokerage doesn't do them, them recommending Amazon and other super pricy stocks does nothing for me. 

Even rule breakers has been doing this. 

Even with that, I just see them as a filter. They have 20 total to recommend. I then remove any Chinese ones. Then remove pharmaceuticals. Then remove industries I don't understand. Then remove companies who are too shady for me. 

It leaves me with 3 or 4 to pick from. 

Been a fan of their Pinterest and zynga recommendations. ,"

Well to those who are saying they made their money because of Motley Fool last year or from one stock pick, consider this. A child with a dart board could have tripled their money since last March considering everything bolted backup after the crash. If you want an astrology subscription to stock tips, Motley Fool is for you. People saying they got in early because of Motley... give me a break, shits so basic and Google does a better job and basic research or analytics. Sure glean from their podcast, and follow it up Joe Rogan. You'll get something out it, sure, but pretty basic, corporate spoon fed bantha fodder, and generalized."

Where is the Motley Fool for Stocks under $25/s or something grossly more affordable but with quality insight and DD? Does that company exist? 

MF: Buy Zynga! (every week for a year, then the stock went up 1/s)

MF: buy this stock right now! (stock suggested is $995/s) ..thanks."

They provide DD, and it‚Äôs up to you whether you want to buy it or not‚Äî and I‚Äôve found they‚Äôre willing to swing for the fences a bit more than year-out analysts. They recommended Roku alongside MDB and something else, and I got excited about Roku, and felt it was underappreciated by the market (not undervalued, lol, but that it wasn‚Äôt recognized as a true contender as a streaming middleman). Also, they didn‚Äôt just say ‚Äúbuy now!‚Äù; they said it‚Äôs $150 now and it‚Äôs too expensive, and they thought it would reasonably go back down to below ~50, which ended up being right.

Also, I don‚Äôt disagree with their central mantra: buy great companies and hold them long-term. If I didn‚Äôt have that constant reminder I would‚Äôve peaced out of AMZN years ago"

2021-03-26 20:35:34,wallstreetbets,"$SUMO Logic, the Goliath vs David of cloud-based tech companies I have been researching this company for almost 6 months, and let me tell why in my opinion I think it's a great investment while trying not to waste your time by making this too long:

What does sumo logic do exactly? ""Sumo Logic, Inc. is a cloud-based machine data analytics company focusing on security, operations, and BI use cases. It provides log management and analytics services that leverage machine-generated big data to deliver real-time IT insights."" quoted from Wikipedia.

Now let us take a look at Sumo's competition and why does it stand out:

There are three main competitors in the field and they are 1. Splunk, 2. Elasticsearch, 3. Datadog.

But what makes their app special? The sumo logic app is the only one in the business ""as I know of"" that offers real-time analytics and monitoring, which is considered a huge plus according to my fellas who are software engineers.

The company has a little over 100 clients including Twitter, Samsung, Motorolla, DELTA airlines, JetBlue, and the list goes on. Moreover, they landed a partnership with Amazon AWS last December.

Now let's get to business, the company IPO was at 22$ per share and now it is somewhere around 18$ ""A huge sale in my opinion"" and its all-time high was at approximately 40$, this recent dip was due to them announcing the revenue of the 4th quarter of 2020 which was a disappointment, however, it was the year of corona after all.

I provided some images showing the chart for the past 3 months, volume, and some more financial data. Please share with me your opinion and thoughts on $SUMO and whether you agree with me that it will be a great investment in 2021 or not."

I see pretty much most phenomena as an opportunity for the rich and powerful to obtain more wealth and control so it‚Äôs kind of a moot point what I think about this specific event. 


World war? More control

The threat of communism? More control, Less freedom.

9-11 yeah more control. 

Y2K, more control. 

Covid, more wealth and power consolidation. 

Obama is president: more wealth and power is consolidated to the elite and less freedom for the individual. 

Trump is president: wealth and power consolidation at the expense of the individual
again.


Widespread public education? Well shit if you work that one right you don‚Äôt even have to pass
Laws!


Modern medical care: so I will be kept alive until
I‚Äôm too weak or demented to decide when my
Time to die is?

2021-03-26 20:10:05,wallstreetbets,"Suez canal and (short term) oil/shipping We all know by now the Suez canal is blocked and recent updates say it can take a few days or a few weeks to clear.  It's a big ship, and it's a small canal so they will literally need to dig this thing out and use tug boats to try and straighten it out again.  If they do clear it over the weekend, then Monday will likely see a drop however if they don't then I expect prices to push up fast due to panic.  It's high risk, high reward.

**So, how do you profit from this?**  Oil shipping companies of course but not just any company, ones that primarily operate between the middle east and Asia.  See the Panama canal is fine so getting OIL to the US isn't the issue.

**How do I know what Oil shipping companies then?**  Look for the companies that have their fleet comprised of Suezmax vessels.  You see, just as the name implies, these are the largest ships made that fit through the Suez canal and the companies that use these ship usually ship primarily to Asian markets.

With the canal locked down, they must go around Africa now which is an extra 14 days.  While spot prices vary a lot, recent (before the blockage) was 16-20k a day.  Now factor in 14 extra says on each trip AND that with longer trips, less ships are available meaning higher spot prices.  These two factors together result in stock going up.

No it's not a distraction from GME or AMC, buy whatever stock you want.  I also don't consider this a long term play. Once the canal is cleared prices will begin to go down pretty fast.

**Tickers to look into:**  There are plenty to look into, but these are above the market cap:   EURN and STNG.   Added bonus is if you actually do want to hold them, sell some CC's and hope for strong dividends at the next earning.

Happy trading either way, and if you get fucked or miss out that's your fault."

2021-03-26 20:07:52,wallstreetbets,"$ROOT - Massive Value and Squeeze Potential? - Here is my Rookie DD **TLDR:** Root is a Car Insurtech Company. Compared to its peers it has deep value in my opinion. It's also the stock with the highest short interest % right now. It has MASSIVE squeeze potential and the momentum has just picked up for the squeeze to get squozen. üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ

# What's $ROOT?

Root, Inc. describes itself as ""a technology company revolutionizing personal insurance with a pricing model based upon fairness and a modern customer experience.

Whether it's relying on credit scores, education history, or occupation, the variables used in pricing auto insurance today unfairly impact those who can least afford insurance. Root is tackling these issues using disruptive technology.

# What Technology?

* Root believes that it can be disruptive in the auto insurance industry through building its own technological full stack. In telematics, this differentiates Root from most U.S. insurers who partner with third-party providers like CMT and TrueMotion. Root claims its approach gives it unique access to the full set of data, instead of the meta data available through partners, and in turn enables models with superior predictive power.
* Root has been very vocal about its #Dropthescore campaign. If a state bans a specific rating factor (like credit score), the insurance companies will look to alternative data sources to increase granularity / provide competitive quotes for their consumers. There are over 100 different insurance carriers in the West that write auto insurance, many of which are significantly smaller than the big boys.  In order to stay competitive, Root can serve as a necessary SaaS for the smaller insurance carriers to stay relevant / competitive.
* Root launched its proprietary loss cost model (or pricing algorithm), UBI 3.0+, which has provided considerable loss ratio improvements. Version 4.0 is expected to be commercialized later in 2021.
* Root believes it can use its proprietary data and machine learning to end the reliance on credit scores, education history, or occupation to determine insurance premiums.
* Root has a mobile-first strategy where more than 75% of customers are acquired through the mobile app. The app can also be used to manage the policy and claims. This separates it from larger players in the space who still rely on a network of agents to handle most of customer acquisitions and claims.
* Root offers discounts for Tesla Autosteer mode making them the first insurance company to adjust premiums based on whether the driver is operating a semi autonomous vehicle. \[[Source](https://www.newswire.com/news/root-insurance-becomes-the-first-insurance-company-to-offer-discounts-5940408)\]

# Where is the Value?

**Comparison with Similar Insurtech Companies**

|*Metric*|*Root*|*MetroMile*|*Lemonade*|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2020 DEP ($mm)|605.2|100.2|158.7|
|Revenue ($mm)|346.8|\*|94.4|
|Cash on Hand ($mm)|1100|?|571.4|
|2021 DEP Guidance Midpoint ($mm)|700|140.6|272.5|
|Market Cap ($Billions)|3.2|1.6|5.6|

\*2019 Revenue of $52.8m with DEP (Direct Earned Premium) of $102.2m

Some numbers from MetroMile were hard to find because they decided to go the SPAC route recently. It's easy to see the discrepancy in valuation between Root and the rest of the Insurtech Companies. *Root is valued at \~$3 Billion with $1.1Billion cash on hand.*

**More Data Points**

I also wanted to include Hippo Home insurance but could not find detailed financial information about the company. Hippo Home Insurance is also going public through the SPAC route in a transaction which represents an Enterprise Value of $5.0 Billion for Hippo \[[Source](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210304005356/en/Hippo-to-Go-Public-in-Merger-with-Reinvent-Technology-Partners-Z-Company-is-Transforming-the-Home-Insurance-Industry)\]. This would represent a market cap of up to $6.2 Billion for Hippo.

In September 2019, Root Raised $350 million in Series E funding which implied a valuation of $3.65 billion \[[Source](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190909005247/en/Root-Insurance-Raises-350-Million-in-Series-E-Funding-Led-by-Coatue-and-DST-Global)\]. A year later, $ROOT began trading on NASDAQ on Oct 28, 2020 at $27 a share ($6.7b valuation). It currently sits at a $3 billion valuation. Did Root improve its technology stack, brand awareness, presence in more states, and financial standing enough in 2020 to be in a better position than where it was in Sept 2019? In my opinion, it did.

# Massive Squeeze Potential?

Root is the company (over $1b valuation) with the highest short interest % right now. As of 02/26/2021 43.7% of the public float was shorted \[[Source](https://www.marketwatch.com/tools/screener/short-interest)\]. More recent data shows that the short interest has risen to 76.6% of float \[[Source](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1370422261774233601?s=20)\]. Recent short interest data indicates that root is leading other companies by a big margin \[[Source](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1369999038326706177?s=20)\].

Due to its recent IPO, insider trading for Root is restricted until the lock up period ends on April 26th, 2021. Due to this restriction, the public float for Root is 25 million shares. At $13 per share, this represents a public float of \~ $325 million available for trading compared to a market cap of $3 billion. For comparison the headphone company has a public float of $68 million even though its market cap is only $212 million.

The momentum has started to reverse but not enough for a squeeze. But for a company of this size, because the actual public float is small, there is not much fuel needed for this to rocket. Low liquidity and high short interest could fuel a massive rocket.

# The Bear Case üåà

* If you are considering this as a squeeze play, it's important to know that the IPO lockup period expires on April 26,2021 \[[Source](https://www.marketbeat.com/ipos/lockup-expirations/)\]. I expect the public float to increase following this date and the Short Interest % to decrease.
* On March 9th 2021, BofA set a price target of $9, far below the $21.92 average price target of Sell-Side analysts \[[Source](https://seekingalpha.com/news/3670736-root-stock-slips-after-bofa-note-sees-negative-cash-flow-for-at-least-5-years)\]. According to the note ""Root will require not insignificant cash infusions from the capital markets to bridge its cash flow needs."" If someone has a link to the more detailed research note from BofA for this price target, please share in the comments.
* Following this note by BofA which stated that Root will need further cash infusion, Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check, LLP started an investigation for potential violations of the federal securities laws on behalf of shareholders of Root, Inc. on March 12th \[[Source](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210312005396/en/Kessler-Topaz-Meltzer-Check-LLP-Is-Investigating-Securities-Fraud-Claims-on-Behalf-of-Root-Inc.-NASDAQ-ROOT-Investors)\].
   * There have been a number of law firms since then that have started investigations into ROOT based on the BofA analysis.. I don't want to call these  frivolous but I personally don't believe that any of these investigations have any grounds to stand on. This lawfirm has been fined before after a federal judge for a previous securities-fraud class action  \[[Source](https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielfisher/2010/10/09/federal-judge-in-stunning-development-slaps-securities-lawyers-with-sanctions/?sh=7f17922bebba)\]
   * I'm not sure why bank of America price target of $9 (which I believe is the lowest price target for Root) is enough to justify a class action.
   * Please Read ""*Root: High Loss Ratio And Cash Burn Aren't A Concern. Here's Why*"" -  \[[Seeking Alpha](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4416019-root-high-loss-ratio-cash-burn-arent-concern)\] which has better DD than mine and addresses the BofA price target and concerns.
* In 2020, due to uncertainty from COVID-19, Root made the decision to reduce marketing spend. This resulted in YoY growth (19.5% revenue growth) that was below expectations for Root. Root plans to reaccelerate marketing investments in 2021 but will this result in expected growth?
* Is disruption possible in the insurance industry with massive competitors?

# What's the Play?

I'm not smart enough to advice others on how to spend their money. As with any other investment, analyze the downside risk vs. the upside potential. If you like this post, I just ask that you add this to your watchlist for now.

It gives them an edge I think, since they are pricing on the true risk: distance driven.  So if mileage is priced properly their claims will always be priced in accurately.

2021-03-26 20:00:27,wallstreetbets,"Quarter End Pension Fund Re-balancing (WTF is that) Just a little primer for you RH newbies on WTF Quartly Pension Fund Re-balancing is.  I will use little numbers and keep it to the basics so you apes can keep up.

Lets start by making a few assumptions:

Pension Fund Balance is $100 (see, little number)

Pension Funds wants 60% of portfolio in Stocks

Pension Fund wants 40% of portfolio in Bonds.

So for you apes that would be $60 in stocks and $40 bonds.

&#x200B;

Now, for this quarters market we all know that interest rates are rising.  That means the price of the bonds is falling (took the big red strapon up the arse).  So now the value of the bonds in the portfolio has dropped to 30%.  We also know that stocks indexes have been up for the quarter so the value of stocks in the portfolio is now 70%.

So, what needs to happen for the Pension Fund portfolio to re-balance back to 60% stocks and 40% bonds?  Very good Ape, they will need to sell 10% stocks and buy 10% bonds.  Selling 10% stocks will lead to a flat or falling stock index (DJIA, SP 500, Nasdaq, Russel).  Methodology for which stocks to sell will very widely from fund to fund.   **The thing to remember is that if there is a big move in either stocks or bonds or both then be aware of the potential re-balancing in the final week or so of a quarter.**

BTW, Money Managers use the same concept within stocks.  They will maintain a certain percentage in each stock sector and re-balance their portfolio."

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Maybe when that church used deception and manipulation to get some poor apes parents to pay 10% of their hard earned money in tithing for nearly 40 years. 

If my dad would have invested just half of what he felt he was supposed to pay in taxes he could be retired and living super comfortably. 

The mormon church is a pretty awful organization. They hate and marginalize gays, transgenders, etc. They have a long history of discrimination against people of color, they engage in neo-Christian-colonialism (they set up churches in other countries/cultures and bleach out the non-conforming aspects so that culture is more white and American). The founder of the Mormon religion was a sexual predator. His successor was a predator, a racist, and a tyrant. 

You should remember that the holdings in Ensign Peak are only a small fraction of their net worth. This is essentially their ‚Äúcash‚Äù position and does not include various other more involved business holdings, real estate, and other physical assets (think art and shit). 

The Mormon church has a net worth that would probably approach $300 Billion *at least*. 

And yet....they still guilt their members into paying more money, giving more time, all the while not really doing a damn thing to improve the world or communities around them. 

The Mormon church is the Citadel and Melvin Capital of the religious world."

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, there are some ways you could make money off of the culture surrounding and comprising mormonism. 

Whenever a Mormon temple site is announced the real estate around the purchased land tends to go up significantly. Especially in areas in the Midwest and Rockies. There is a very good degree of nepotism in the higher ‚Äúranks‚Äù of Mormonism so it‚Äôs not uncommon to hear about someone who made a bunch of money buying a land plot and then a few months later the temple is announced to be built basically next-door. 

And more broadly....just write some fiction books that weave mormonism and American conservatism against the backdrop of some fictional tale and you can make a ton of money. Paintings, music, clothing, etc. are all pretty much the same too. Target that specific audience and know how to talk the talk and you can get some money. Unless you‚Äôve really been to parts of Utah and Idaho that are utterly dominated by the Mormon church, you just wouldn‚Äôt believe how involved the church is in the local culture. 

Pretty much it‚Äôs like any other cult group: they are primed for stories and material that confirms their bias and world view or celebrates their shared ‚Äúculture‚Äù Bc their own culture is generally so insular and irrelevant in the world around them. 

Cults man. Good stuff."

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"0.01% of their wealth went to housing homeless, assuming that guy's telling the truth.

To put that in perspective, it's estimated that 2,798 people are homeless in SLC according to google. That amounts to $3573 each.

Meanwhile, it looks like a cheap home in SLC is around $50k - $100k. Let's assume they're smart and do some combination of building homes and renovating homes over time to avoid spiking prices by reducing supply and giving some initial support to the people so they can get on their feet and go with the $100k number. 

The cost to end homelessness in SLC, by literally buying all of them homes, would be around $279.8M, or 0.27% of their wealth.

They have investors that know the market and play the game just like the people here. It‚Äôs part of being smart and thinking about the future. It‚Äôs a part that will allow ensign to continue printing books and pamphlets without needed the funds from tithing, which could mean that more money gets spent on humanitarian aid/Bishop storehouse.

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"So easy to say from the outside looking in. How much do you want them to do? The Catholic Church has more money than them, to a point where it‚Äôs incalculable. And if we‚Äôre going to say they could do a lot better couldn‚Äôt we all do a lot better too? Do we tell those people that donated to the ape foundation ‚Äúwell you donated $690.42 but you made over 300,000 with your investments. You could have donated more‚Äù you don‚Äôt know what they are planning to do with that money, or what goals they have, you just conclude that they can. That‚Äôs my point. It‚Äôs just to easy to criticize, and that‚Äôs my opinion. I respect that you think differently though.

Edit: I also was just trying to explain that there are costs to everything, and people don‚Äôt seem to see past their own noses, whereas the church has plans for their funds and does so wisely. They seek out to do the most with their money. Making it grow is part of that. Maybe to donate more and be able to help more people they are in need of making more money to go with those plans that they have."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"And if 10% income mean you can't afford those things, you likely couldn't afford them before tithing. Meaning the net $ is severely in your favor."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"The point is Ensign is probably **illegally** not paying taxes because although they are registered/associated with the Mormon church (and thus get tax-exempt), they aren‚Äôt using the profits for religious purposes. They are just hoarding hundreds of billions of dollars and using the money to prop up for-profit businesses and buying real estate. The law has to be enforced, not necessarily changed."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,2 years is nothing dude. Do you run their books? Do you see the money? No you don't. You chirp what they tell you.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I said it was from 5 years ago
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,One of us
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I gave a link that‚Äôs updated. It said they are approaching 1 billion a year.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"1. I'd prefer not share details that would identify myself, but glad to see the church hasn't changed its stance on never believing any victim if it would be in any way inconvenient to the church to do so.
2.glad you acknowledge it.
3.fine, how many female bishops are there? Do women have access to the same positions as men, or just token leadership roles so you can pretend you aren't sexist pieces of shit?
4.when did the church begin allowing Black men as lead ers in the church?  And when the church started (when a known con artists claimed to have found golden plates in a nonexistant language that only he could read and were then immediately lost before anybody else could see them talking about the teachings when a nonexistent people came to the Americas and were entirely lost with literally no trace ever found by any archeologist) they were polygamous right? And allowed old men to marry multiple 14 year old women (but the church doesnt support pedophiles right?) They also still taught Black people were black because they bore the mark of Kain and were thus all evil, right? But no, not racist at all, who could ever find any problems with the church? I'm just crazy, right?"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Um, the church does have priests. They bless the sacrament every week. But you can only do that if you have a penis."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,One of us!
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"I appreciate the link but there's issues. In my article Oaks says the church, your article says LDS charities. Those are not the same as the church can manage charities while people donate to them, mostly with free labor to thanks its members

Also 5 years ago it was 40 million a year from the mouth of an apostle and these days it's 1 billion? Bit of a jump I'd say which more shows my point. A billion flows through their charities but that doesn't mean the church provides that funding."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"You‚Äôre making issues out of nothing. They direct the money to what they spend. Those charities are greatly funded and overseen by the church. The church isn‚Äôt a business, it gets most of its money through tithing, donations, and smart investing. That‚Äôs how it has become the wealthiest church next to the Catholic Church (with a fraction of the members). 

Also I pointed out what you said was wrong, and gave proof of what the younger man was saying. Through the church the aid efforts are approaching a billion. 

Why tf you crying out they should be doing more when proof is given that they have been. Really people are just insatiable. Y‚Äôall won‚Äôt be satisfied with anything, hate just to hate. You can disagree with the church or it‚Äôs beliefs or whatever, but why are you still trying to undermine good things they are doing? You said you wanted them to do more and the article states that they are doing more. Insatiable."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I would just expect a religion that professes to be the one true church of christ would act more like him. Consider the lillie's of the field...

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"What part of that billion dollars to humanitarian aid isn‚Äôt being Christ like? You want them to pay taxes, you want them to do more, at what expense? They have to pay for all the church up keep, electricity, water, expansion, temples, and a lot of missionary efforts. On top of that they buy property in places around the world in varying markets for temple space where membership is high enough. Managing funds is absolutely necessary or they would be dead in the water, with no way to continue to grow. Christ performed the miracle on the rocks by taking what he had and multiplying it, in a sense this is what the church is doing, and it‚Äôs dispersing the fruits of that. Try to get a basic understanding of what you‚Äôre trying to criticize before you do so. In fact I‚Äôm sure you don‚Äôt know what the highest authorities of the church do, which is the law of consecration. I‚Äôm hardly a believer anymore, but do not criticize things you don‚Äôt know."

Cemex is the cheapest at nearly 7 bucks a share if you wanna own.

Options, CRH has lower IV. Also muck lower trade volume.
Cemex has 31x the trade volume of CRH.  Options IV is higher."

We cleared a lot of those fuckers out, I mean *a lot* of them. Plus, the government in Somalia actually kicked things up a notch and made it a much less friendly place for them to use as a safe haven.

Is piracy still an issue? Oh yeah, that was my first thought about this when I saw so many ships deciding it was time to heave-to and head around the horn. But, it's much less of an issue than it used to be. Lotta dead pirates would attest to that, if they could."

So with the shortage, and now this canal issue - I'm trying to figure out a play.  some Calls in Cemex and CRH to balance is how im feelin. plus some oil and liquid fuels.  puts on electronics if it goes over a week.

North America isn't really affected directly  I wouldn't think- Asian exports cross the pacific to NA, unless the materials area heading to an Atlantic port. (or just pacific ship plus train).  Cemex is a Mexican multinational, so they might see more imported materials. Cemex has deep water import terminals for shipping, 2 in California, and 1 at the Gulk of mexico side.  Mexico Cemex has 4 on the pacific side, 2 gulf 1 Caribbean.

I couldn't find as much on CRH for their shipping infrastructure, but they are a big player in North America, arguably larger than Lafarge even."

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I think there are more specialised companies to help in such a situation instead of the US navy.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Central banks create money out of thin air for governments to spend. The governments then owe interest on this money that was created out of thin air, which has to be paid back via taxes or more debt (which the central banks will print, along with more interest). It's a never-ending cycle, which eventually results in everything being owned by the central banks.

All of the central banks are connected via the Bank of International Settlements, World Bank, and IMF. Commercial banks like JP Morgan, Citibank, Goldman Sachs, are all part of the system, since they collectively own the Federal Reserve.

The book is very eye-opening and I've seen it dismissed and insulted but never discredited.

(My concern about the ""Great Reset"" is that the banks are planning to somehow erase all debt, which is unpayable at this point, and replace all currency with a digital dollar that will offer no privacy. I am not sure if or when this will happen, but it will likely result in a ""wealth reset"" for all but the super rich who own hard assets. The ultimate meaning of theGreat Reset is still a ""conspiracy theory"" at this point, but everything about central banks in The Creature from Jekyll Island is fact.)"

Of course that means prices will go up, so mortgages will be bigger, but they depend on volume, which which is limited by the supply. How is this good for a mortgage wholesaler?"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"New homebuyers will have to deal with rising interest rates right now. The ten year yield has risen significantly, and they should be a proportional effect in mortgage rates. Increased cost of debt with deter new house buyers.

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,He‚Äôs talking about the climate during summer in the Persian region
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"So what i said in my previous comment wasn't true. However, after doing actual research, it seems that while Slavery was still a thing in persia (as it was everywhere in the classical world), the majority of the agriculture and industry was performed by free men, the army was almost entirely free, and debt Slavery was almost non existent.

This can be contrasted to the Greek cities as a whole, which used a lot of slaves relative to their population. It can be further contrasted with the Spartans specifically, who relied entirely on their Helot  underclass for their entire economy."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"The Persian empire wasn't dependent on slaver, with the majority of their agriculture and industry being performed by free men.

Further, democracy and Slavery are unrelated. The vote in athens specifically (which I know a tiny bit about) was restricted to every citizen, which means no women and no slaves can vote. Infact, even a lot of the random athenian men couldn't vote because ""citizenship"" was a lot more restricted in antiquity than it is now."

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Op hold for the long run. While the suez situation may have messed with your short term investment it is not likely to have a true long term impact on your savings as the trade market is likely to surge when the canal is cleared as investors try to make back their losses
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Somehow I feel like this is going to lead back to an opportunity in ornamental gourd futures.

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is the way!

Profit tactics cheat sheet updated!"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"A call allows you to buy 100 shares of a stonk at the strike price. For OP that was $50. Because GME is above $50, the call is ""In The Money"" (ITM). OP gets an amazing deal on his shares (or can sell the call on to someone else who wants that deal).

A put allows you to sell 100 shares of a not-stonk at the strike price. For OP that was $150. Because GME was above $150 at market close the put is ""Out of The Money"" (OTM). OP (and anyone else) would be even more retarded than an ape to sell GME at $150 through a put when they could just sell at the $180 the market closed at today.

Buying a call is bullish. You expect the price to go up, then you can ""call up"" your buddy to let him know how smart you are.

Buying a put is bearish. You expect the price to go down, then you can ""put down"" all the silly bagholders."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"If stonk is going down, sometimes a put can make you more money to buy more shares."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs very unusual for exercising to be more beneficial than selling but in this case, I could exercise for more than what I could sell it for. 99.9% of the time, it will make more sense to just sell the option."

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"I thought I understood this concept but I guess I do not yet. If your call is already ITM do you still have to wait for said date? Maybe I'm just spacing on this. I have re

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"You don‚Äôt have to wait for a certain date once it‚Äôs in the money but you still have time for it to go up in value do usually you should hold. By buying a put at 150, I ensured that any price over 50 or under 150 would bring in the same amount of revenue that was higher than my cost. Buying the put increased my cost but ensured that I was guaranteed at least a small gain."

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"100% agree on that ratio. This is the case with most of their headlines. You never actually find anything out thats new information due to the story being presented in a manner to please and comfort you. Everyones favorite story is one they already know.

You read into a CNN or MSNBC article with a ridiculous title only to find out the story is lacking ethos entirely due to no actual proof or evidence. Logos is not taken seriously and pathos is completely relied upon. The only one thats ever subject to change is ethos, like how they love recording each others conversations but even that they screw up by reporting on it incorrectly. Obviously certain people believe these headlines without even reading into them whatsoever and mention them in passing.

Let‚Äôs be honest though.  If you are running an app sizing people up it‚Äôs going to operate similar to robo advisor platforms.  There might be 35 ‚Äútailored‚Äù portfolios for various risk tolerances just like for clothing there might be 35 ‚Äúpre tailored‚Äù sizes.  All that app is doing is putting you in a bucket so their fulfillment team can JIT order in bulk for various orders."

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"I appreciate you discussing the secret trade correlation people are not talking about, so that they can keep opening cheap positions. Allow me to damper your fantasy to save you from overextending into future losses. The oil industry is not easy to bet on. Not all oil is created equal, and the same goes for oil companies that might have extremely high multiples (P/E). The big kicker when oil scarcity looms is that the big oil players carefully avoid oversupply. However, that changes with risk expectations. The immediate bump in oil price will without a doubt be met with a sudden massive increase in oil supplied, because of a will to overcome the immediate term prolonged global shipping disruption, to prevent future problems should this reoccur, and to assuage governments at the cusp of global market reignition that must be fueled with cheap energy to prohibit disastrous inflationary effects. All commodities are likely on the chopping block as part of a worldwide effort, but energy products especially. Oil more than any. I plan to profit in the near term on the oil trade based on the brief price bump, like you, but expect oil to drop to $20-$30 within three to six months. History has proven that price to be the sweet spot to stimulate business expansion. Hence, I am taking both sides of the trade respective of time. No guarantees are offered here, and this is not investing advice."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Long play....pipelines and the companies that build/own them.  If this lasts long enough to put a hurt on the oil supply the clamor for a pipeline from the oil producing gulf states to Europe/Asia is going to be huge.

I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôre all familiar with MANSA MUNSA spreading gold while on his distant travels, deflating the ‚Äúworth‚Äù of it in the process. Could something similar happen to our dollar?

There's bull/bear opportunities all around, and it's fucking stupid to just pick one and stay a bull out of peer pressure.

You don't pick between a fork and a spoon because you're pretty sure you're going to be eating soup, you look at the meal first and then you grab a utensil.

No one here who actually cares about money or is smart enough to follow is going to fucking üíéü§ö a shitty play through to the end.

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I think thats why it was approval only type thing, but I knew the guy from a few times with the groups. He was suggesting me going for the apprenticeship but it would have taken too much time and been a little awkward"

One fun one I always tell people who aren't great with plants is green onion (if you like it).  I always buy some from the grocery store and cut it down to the base. Stick the bottom end in a glass of water and change it every day.  They'll sprout new onions in no time.  Last time I did it, I bought them in May and finally stopped using them in November."

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Besides working in a kitchen for a couple years, a lot of my learning came from trying to learn how to make my fave or most bought meals.

Start with something easy like pasta. [here's a knockout recipe - pasta aglio e olio](https://youtu.be/bJUiWdM__Qw). Easy because you can do some chicken with it and spice the chicken accordingly. Now I make bread weekly and love making pizza from scratch too.

Generally...salt and pepper on all meat and add some brown sugar on red meat, olive oil and salt for veggies, butter if it's going in a pan or being roasted.

Taste your food/sauces along the way.

Just cook shit, it's one of those things you'll learn through doing. then you get comfortable and just kind of freestyle it most days."

I will tell you that the stocks that a lot of the employees get is sold and bought again often. They will sell the raise and buy the dip a couple times a year because it is so regular.

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, I don‚Äôt understand it fully and will probably spend time googling the subject to understand how the few is captured.

In general from reading on personal finance, even a 1% fee can change your net worth at retirement by 20%+. Obviously with an ETF the idea is she is going to earn you more profit to warrant the .75% they charge, but we‚Äôll have to see how that plays out over the long term."

Tell me if I'm correct. You bought $1000 worth on Monday and sold for $5000 on Wednesday, then bought $5000 and sold for $86000? To get the 86K you sold the 5K for 17.2x what you paid for it? Is that right? Thanks"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Awesome thanks for the informative reply üôèüèº will definately get into this
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"#Just make sure you understand the risks. 

There is a ton less risk involved with owning shares as opposed to buying options. If you buy shares you will always have them unless you sell or the company goes bankrupt. Don't sell calls naked that's some seriously retarded üåàüêª shit... not to mention you have to have some seriously big capital to even get into it without getting fucked.... This is why I brought up the üåàüêª comment.

 Don't sell puts without the cleared money to buy 100 shares at the strike price you set. It's almost as bad as selling naked calls.

 Follow those rules and you'll probably be okay homie. I haven't been in options for long really. I understand the basics and my risk tolerance on options is relatively small... I either buy barely otm calls, sell covered OTM/ITM calls, or do cash secured puts. That's it man. I don't try to staddle, butterfly, or condor shit.... Too fucking complicated for my smooth brain. Just keep it simple and safe and you'll be okay probably. I was doing this well before I ever came to wallstreetbets. This sub is hella fun. And I feel like I finally found my home on reddit. Took way too long to check it out. r/investing was getting boring

#but... most importantly Do your own fucking DD. Don't just blindly trust what you see here. Look into it and verify for yourself that the investment makes sense to you.

My biggest problem is I keep spending my money on side projects before I can invest it. I'll be going full time this coming week tho so hopefully I can start putting my money to work. 

What are LEAPS?"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Educate yourself about them well before using them since they can be tricky and you could lose all you invested.

Leaps are Long Calls at the money.

Example: APPLE is trading at $120

An APPLE 121 CALL EXPIRING 09/22/21
would be a leap.

Meaning I'm betting the stock would 121 by September but since it's March and is trading at 120. I have little risk of dipping and a lot of probability of going up since it only has to go up 1$ for me to be in the money.

Theta is the value of the call decaying because expiration is getting sooner, time takes value away. But if apple jumps to 131$ in July/ August I could  sell it for a lot of profit."

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"I asked him today If he bought the dip yesterday. Surprisingly he said he had set a buy order at 90, he's learning. Actually in fairness he has done pretty decent in the market over the years, his biggest gains I think have come from visa. He just doesn't follow Reddit and so has no idea wtf is actually happening."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Attaboy - I don't think many of us are super sure what to do with quite this level of volatility, so a lot of us have been getting our learn on."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Happens all the time for me. I usually only get alerts when it goes down.. even after it spiked 20, 50 or 100% that day, goes down 5%, alert!!!!"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,The would still need to unwind their short positions. It‚Äôs in for a penny in for a pound at this point.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well. ""Bidders"" (no one uses that term) is everyone no matter which side they are on in the stock. It's basically useless for anything else than showing interest in s stock. If you put out a buy order, you are a buyer, no matter of you buy order gets filled or not. If you put out a sell order, you are a seller of the stock, even if your order doesn't get filled. Have you ever heard the phrase ""I'm a buyer of aapl at 99?"" Does not imply they will manage to buy at 99, just that they would like to... As would nearly everyone else in the world... Hence why it won't go that low because others are more eager.

If there are more buy orders than sell orders, the price goes up. That is what's happening. Some of those orders will not get filled, maybe, until it hits the right price. 

Example: stock price is 10.00 and there are one buy orders at 9.75 and 9.5 and 9 and 8.75, and sell orders at 10.5 and 11.

Now that is a snapshot in time. Everyone under the 9.5 will have to realise that as it stands right now, they will not get filled. So either they wait a bit or, depending on their price sensitivity and eagerness, they'll have to cough up some money."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,The other side of the bid is the ask.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"No. That still doesn't give you the direction the price is going


There are bids for buys (buyers) and bids for sells (sellers). There are asks for buys (sellers) and asks for sells (buyers). That what leads to the bid ask spread. If a bid and an ask meet, a transaction happens.

Adding bids and asks up does not tell you how a stock will be moving.

Adding all buyers and adding all sellers does.

How do you not understand this?"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I understood the bid and the ask decades ago. I got one sentence into your word salad and knew you have nothing to tell me.

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I read your name as cocaine... I should probably buy a little more GME.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"So say you write a covered call expiring today, you can roll out your call. So basically you execute a multi leg option trade where you buy back your option and write one for a further date in a single transaction. So for example.

Say you wrote the $150 strike call. Today it‚Äôs in the money. But you wanna keep your shares. So you bring up your option. Bring up an order to buy to close which has a premium of $30.70 per share, select the trade to add an option leg- this will take you back to your options chain where you go to let say 4/1 date. The $150 call for 4/1 has a bid of 38.80. So, -30.70 + 38.80 = 8.10 per share collected by rolling it out plus you get to keep your shares. Now- they COULD get exercised early if someone really wants your shares but that is a very low chance. You can also roll out as well as rolling up- where you buy back your shares and write further out but also up your strike price so you get more for your shares if you get assigned. Like this. Same example- buy back the 3/26 150c but this time you write the $160c for 4/1. Bid for that is 32.60. So you will only net $1.90 in premium (-30.70+ 32.60) but you are also raising your strike price by $10 a share if you happen to get assigned.

Now the most important part of this is doing a multi leg option trade. If you did single leg trades you would need to have enough money in your account to close your contract to write another, but by doing a multi leg option trade, you just get the net premium or pay the net cost depending on which contracts you choose. Hopefully this helped explain it. If you have more questions or don‚Äôt understand a part of this, please don‚Äôt be afraid to ask and I‚Äôll try to answer whatever you need to know/ try to explain differently if you don‚Äôt understand something"

I think you will have the last laugh, but I would look for less OTM contracts personally.

Keep buying dude. Laugh when all these tools are crying when their accounts blow up when tsla goes to $400 and arkk goes to $80 by Sept.

Don't hold them till expiration though. Unload by late July imo.

To be clear, I'm not super sold on the 27c for 9/17. But I think you have a decent shot to hit it in 6 months. 6 months ago SU was trading for under $13. It's going to 30. And I think they will kill next ER. If oil stays above $55 on average the next 6 months I think you have a good shot at a triple banger."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks! I am confident in it. When it was trading at $23-$24 the contracts were worth over $2 so even if it can hit that again I will be happy but I think it can go higher. I am pretty bullish on earnings also and am planning to hold through. They also have a billion $ stock buyback planned and there are rumors they will increase their dividend.

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"No you moron, the second article isn't ""bullish"" on GME, it's literally just reporting the fact that it went up that day without making any value judgement about the company as in investment whatsoever. It's not an ""editorial line"", it's literally just reporting a fucking data point. 

And the fact that it went up a particular day is completely fucking irrelevant to the first article. GME is a hyper-volatile stock, and if the article had come out on a different day by  pure chance (and it was pure chance the article came out when it did), it would have coincided with fairly spectacular drops in GME value, and yet I don't think you clowns would have accepted that as a valid reason for the article, which is to say you guys are going to criticize the article no matter what, and the fact that GME went up that day is totally irrelevant. 

In fact, a hyper-volatile stock going up on a certain day is, if anything, a pretty damn good reason to NOT buy the stock on that day. Many idiots on here are convinced that a large daily increase in GME is the 'real thing' this time and its the beginning of GME going to the moon, but even if GME does go to the moon, its going to have plenty of crashes long before then. 

Also, if you believe these goofy fucking conspiracy theories, why would there be ""bullish"" articles on GME at all? Did the hedge funds only choose to pay off half the writers? Why is it only manipulation when it doesn't support what your support? You're seriously contradicting yourself. 

Whenever there are these massive speculative asset price rises, financial advisors are always telling people to stay away from them, be it silver in 2010, cryptocurrencies over the past few years, telsa last year and so on. Inexperienced investors get caught up in the hype and take on significant amounts of risk without realizing it. GME isn't special here, and in this situation specifically the advice is targeted towards people with their stimulus checks, many of whom don't have a lot of money and shouldn't be gambling with risky stocks like GME. Even if you want to attribute anterior motives to these people (which could only apply to this situation and not the other cases where they give advice like this), it would be that they want the money spend on consumer spending to help businesses make more money, instead of inflating asset prices like GME stock (which is actually a better outcome for most people than GME price going up)."

However Reuters also has deep connections to the City of London, Wall Streets largest financial competitor, so it might be that bankers have asked the editorial staff over at Reuters to fan the flames of GME in hopes of being the economic beneficiary.

4. You seem to assume news agencies report out the news in a sort of random way,  where it is just coincidence when and what a particular reporter reports on.

Because of this news agencies are run by smart and powerful people who publish some things but not other things as a way of trying to change public behavior. I'm sorry,  articles are not published to protect the possible portfolios of retail investors,  CNBC does not care even the least bit about retail investors.   
   
GME is an important topic Wall Street would prefer you not invest in,  and you can see that by their mouthpieces screaming for regulation and asking people not to invest.  Doubtlessly the same representatives from Wall Street that spoke to CNBC have spoken to the editorial staff at Reuters. Yet Reuters thinks the stock is rising.  I can promise you this difference is not an absent minded one."

**There have been literally THOUSANDS of article in the US since the start of the year about the price of GME going up and many hundreds of them had nothing about why you shouldn't buy the stock.**

The reason they're writing about GME is because how many multi-billion companies go up 32% in a single day? What stocks have been more talked about this year than Gamestop? The primary financial interest of news websites is CLICKS. The more clicks they get on an article, the more ad money they make. And since there's a lot of people interested in gamestop, something warning them not to buy gamestop is going to grab a lot of attention.

>This isn't some vast conspiracy thing upon the thing where a few trolls go around bribing journalists. That is your fantasy that you're protecting onto me. Media companies have economic interests, and they write articles based on those interests. It's very normal.

These media organisations have no interest in what happens to the GME share price EXCEPT if there is a conspiracy involving hedge funds. Why the fuck would these sites care one jot if the share price of GME continues to rise unless they're being bribed? They don't care, they care about headlines that make people click on the article, unless, again, they're being bribed.

A quick perusal of the comments in this post will show you that most people here *literally believe there is a conspiracy involving bribery by hedge funds*.

>Why would some media companies support GME? Wow, the first interesting question you've had yet. Why would Reuters support GME?

Okay, so you said it wasn't a conspiracy involving bankers, now you're literally saying it's a conspiracy involving bankers.

here's an objective difference in reporting.....IN AMERICA:

[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gamestop-gme-upgraded-buy-does-160004421.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gamestop-gme-upgraded-buy-does-160004421.html)

This is an article by an american company, the eighth biggest news site in the US, talking about why GME has been upgraded to a buy with nothing about why it shouldn't actually be a buy. Unlike the Reuters article which, again, was literally just reporting a data point, this article is actually genuinely bullish because its talking about why GME is a buy.

Did the bankers forget to bribe Yahoo? Or, as I've been saying all along, maybe, just MAYBE, these news sites work on generating ad revenue by getting people to click on news articles. Christ almighty.

>You seem to assume news agencies report out the news in a sort of random way, where it is just coincidence when and what a particular reporter reports on. And sometimes that's truly the case, but not on big issues. When it comes to important topics what is said in print can produce drastic changes in public behavior.

There's absolutely nothing random about it. GME is the biggest stock market news story of the year by a considerable margin. THAT'S why people are writing articles about its share price movement.

As for when the article came out, then yes, that is a complete conincidence, and we know this because these kind of articles have been produced consistently over the past two months regardless if GME is heading up or down.

You have still not provided a single jot of evidence that CNBC has a financial interest in the share price of GME going down other than baseless conspiracy theories."

Every time I have mentioned it I have been contradicted and shot down which makes me think there is either something in it or I am just a dumb ape. Bottom line is if they are hiding the huge quantity of shorts this may be the rabbit hole. 

There is definitely such a thing as short ETF‚Äôs and there has been some interesting activity with GME ETF share borrowing the last few weeks. I have so far been led down the avenue of ETF share stripping and inverse ETF‚Äôs, interesting stuff regardless..."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,">By your exact logic, if one party, again by some crazy effort, manages to artificially suppress the price of IVM, wouldn't it cause other ETF market makers to sell shares as you describe, thus making that ""artificial"" price real?

Operational shorting is also the very same mechanism by which you smooth out volatility. In other words, other firms can and do engage in the very same practice - they see volume flooding the market, they can buy the ETF without selling the underlying. In this manner it's actually much harder to short ETFs in order to disrupt the underlying, compared to straight shorting shares of the stock. You now have to fight two layers of market makers instead of just one to get the directional movement you want. It's a very inefficient manner to try to manipulate one stock.

>You're claiming that it's impossible that a company would take on such risk, and I look at 2008 and don't understand why you have such confidence in that assumption.

2008 wasn't caused by companies willingly taking on risk. It was caused by firms *drastically misjudging the level of risk they have incurred*. Just like hedgefunds shorting a stock to high levels was them incurring risks they did not consider before - you bet they've included that in their risk models now.

>Again, why is this correlation the one that disproves the argument above? Why do they have to be so tightly tied? This entire thing is suggesting market manipulation, obviously it's not gonna be like OH LOOK IT'S RIGHT THERE ON THE TICKER GUYS.

Because OP literally circled on the ticker as evidence to support their thesis, so I'm refuting that specific piece of evidence they used lol.

>You seem to be saying this is ridiculous, and therefore impossible. I'm saying it's ridiculous, but that doesn't make it impossible, albeit improbable.

Perhaps we're just arguing semantics. It's possible for Citadel to give up its market-making role effective tomorrow. It doesn't mean it's not ridiculous. Likewise, it's possible for a firm to short ETF to try to affect movement, but it is so inefficient that it is basically guaranteed no one is doing it. It's like trying to claim that market makers are sending interns to buy consoles from other retailers, fabricating receipts and trying to return them to physical Gamestop locations in order to fuck with sales numbers. Can that possibly affect sales number? Yes it's ""possible"". Do you have reasonable expectation that any market makers are doing that?"

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,There's still DD all over the damn place.  You just have to shift through more bullshit to get to it.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Everything can be explained by the bubble. It leads to all this madness
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Too soon, we wait for the Monday's dawn"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Is this other place an account/WSB age thing? Cause I got my old account too that's been here since ~2016

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thank you very much, people are so nice here"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Wowza
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Someone bought for $1.2k.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"They have a Barclays investor conference on YouTube where they casually said in response to a question as to when they are going to announce some info that they would announce ""something"" in ""roughly"" q1, which everyone interpreted as ""q1l

Which might be why it dropped this week"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's a huge leap from ""something"" into partnership."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah the something there I don't remember exactly what they said but it wasn't partnership... I'd have to rewatch but I think they were suggesting MPDV order number announcement not partnership.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh the partnership part came from a deleted cryptic all emoji tweet on the official canoo account which was five emoji, middle one was a handshake, the right most one a smartphone

Could be a ride share app deal to be kept secret for a long time. They didn't give a time frame for that announcement though."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"I would be much more interested in MPDV mumbers. I don't think anyone realizes it yet, but that vehicle is what this company is going to be known for."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"All the vehicles have amazing potential, but there is a big gap between a good product and a good company.

Concrete data at earnings hopefully will be helpful."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just a question if you can answer, as I haven't done DD for $CP (wasn't on my radar)...the stock has gone up almost geometrically since 2002 when it started at $9.15 CAD. It's obvious that bulls ran this stock up, even though at times the CP had to outright stop operations on the East Coast a couple of years back due to large scale protests against the UCP policies.

I'm very concerned about the earnings ratio as well...even though the P/E is at a decent level, the earnings themselves don't amount to as much as some other companies: say Apple which is estimated to be at a cool $333 billion USD. Even though the railway only shows an earnings of $2.44 billion.

Obviously, earnings isn't everything, but I'm still concerned about the bull / bear rally. Were only the bulls involved in the stock or were there bears? It doesn't look like there were any for a while, and by extension of that analysis, it's reasonable to assume that liquidity might dry up -- I'm taking a shot in the dark here so please bear with me (or correct me if I'm wrong).

So, if the bears weren't really present, or if they were and turned into bulls, what was the determining factor?"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Tl;dr?
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,The information in this DD  should be used in Medical Education Books. It would help for Med. students to understand more mechanism of action (MOA)
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes.  It is.  They have fast track status and the FDA has been involved in discussions as they went from 7 patients in a POC study to 16 patients in PH1.  Efficacy (a PH2 finding) was clearly evident 1 year ago and confirmed in the expanded PH1.

The FDA then green lighted pivotal trials."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Mormonism is hard-core creationist; they believe that there's life on other worlds, but they're all either a) humans who were put there by god(s) too, or b) gods themselves."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"their pnh drug bcrx 9930 not getting approval

their sales of orledayo being shit, not even because the drug sucks but because it takes time to get the whole process of ongoing sales going and it's therefore an opportunity cost as this ticker might stagnate for a year or so"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,hopefully $15-$20. Orledayo sales are not gonna be as awesome as everyone makes them out to be.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,sadly it's how the media works
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,No they couldn't and you don't use this tool so you don't know what you're talking about.  Just keeping using your swipey apps on your phone and your kewl pretty graphs on robinhood ok?  That's your level.  Let professionals use enterprise level tools ok kid?
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Calling it now... he's gonna get assigned his 50k shares when options expire and it'll lower his Cost average. LMFAO

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,So that's why there was no volume when I tried to buy some?

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I signed up to the service as part of a DD i wasn‚Äôt impressed and dont think it will make it. Streaming is getting saturated
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"This seems to be the biggest point against them -- their service is underwhelming. But that's where I think the big revenue growth this year (and next year's projection, if they can meet it) is going to help them a lot, because having more revenue should allow them to spend a lot more on new original content. 

As for the market saturation, you're right, every ape and their wife's boyfriend has their own streaming service these days, and IMO we're headed right back toward the same sort of bundled streaming service deals that cable providers offered, because who wants to subscribe to 10 different streaming services if you could save 15% by subscribing to a bundle of all 10? So that's a big streaming industry shakeup growing on the horizon.

But that aside, I think Curiosity Stream differentiates themselves within the market in two ways: fact-based programming (a quiet but solid niche that they fill quite nicely) and their very low price point (there aren't a lot of big streaming services offering content for less than $2/month)."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hmm, that is troubling, thanks for following up"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks ape, inspirational."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,This guy fucks
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Good morning boys. I think we‚Äôre on to something with that close on Friday.

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Well how did this age??
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Ah... Badly only have a little over $800 left. But other than that my credit score shot up by some 10pts bc of how much I paid down early in the day. lost a little over 6k yesterday.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"What how??? End of day yesterday SPY soared, you said you bought calls?"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"I said I bought puts. I tried to sell at 11k but found out that I had accidentally used unsettled funds forcing me to call up Ally Invest. It took over 2hrs to get to someone and by then my position had been murdered.
EDIT: I Sold my calls on Wednesday when I made this post."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,You must be confused read the comment chain I replied to lol you said you‚Äôre going with calls first otm Friday expiration... that‚Äôs why I was like fuck you hit the jackpot
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,That was 2 days ago. On Thursday. I sold all my calls except for 1
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,So close
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Yea. I'm thinking yoloing the rest of my stimulus + profit will end to a cycle of booms and bust so I decided to play a game with myself. Where some day I save 13-80% of profit and when it gets to 15k I will save a quarter of it into stocks. Hopefully this will keep things interested and safer. All the while trading SPY FDs of course.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,SPY FDs are the way

03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Sorry man i keep my losses real
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,So source Q? Where did you determine that Comex is the supplier of last resort?
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Any sources/source list?
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Around 70% of silver is mined as a byproduct of other metals (copper, lead, zinc, etc). 

It takes roughly 10 years (from the start of exploration to actual mining) for a new mine to go into production.

That‚Äôs just the supply side. It‚Äôs true, there is a lot of silver in the ground, but at what cost and timeframe will it take to mine?

The demand side, the majority of demand is industrial, another portion is for jewelry and silverware.

Investment / physical demand only represents a portion of overall demand, let‚Äôs call it 20%.

The squeeze doesn‚Äôt need to effect the entire silver supply, it just needs to add on to demand that is already there.

5 million people buying 20 ounces each is 100 million ounces. If investment demand was about 200 million ounces, that‚Äôs an increase of 50% demand on the investment side."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Right with you man, I,m spending everything I earn on silver now. This just got personal....I‚Äôd starve before I let it go too"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,The best day of my life was when I sold my CVS stock.  It literally did nothing for me in about three years of holding.   I would say it ranks up there with the worst stocks I have ever purchased.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Burry is in  CVS how could you not mention that
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Actually tons of them have alcohol and still die
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I wish that was my average price. That was the current price at the time of the SS.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,So how much money did you make?
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,26 ?  Geez I thought 800 calls were crazy. Hope you unloaded most of this on Wednesday. Otherwise would love to see the loss porn.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ah, how the turntables..."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"I had puts and sold at open on Thursday but holding isn't stupid. Every 2 weeks it gets down and I am confident it'll be the same way again. Even if it doesn't print, it'll be low enough to recouped the investment. Bulls and bears money, just at different times."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,How can you check historial price of options? I only know how to check current ones.... Thanks.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Confused by this, if something dumps 30% that's volatility right? Why would IV crush happen? Big moves either way creates high IV, no?"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"I go to finance.yahoo.com or Fidelity Active Trader. Once I select an option, I choose a chart. Then change the time interval. It‚Äôs a bit weird on yahoo, as a few settings show the wrong interval."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes and no. IV is crush is dependent on many things.

One of the biggest one being ""the expectation of large swings"". 

Eg. before an earning report there is a feeling that the share price might dump 50% and so the IV is high. Earning comes and the shares fall -- lets say 40%. More than likely the next day even with the price dump the Put will end up losing a lot in extrinsic value.

Keep in mind this is a very broad and simple explanation to address your specific point.

There are a lot more things that go into it (time value, company sector etc). Plus there is a lot of maths involved (black sholes and probably more stuff which is beyond my simple brain).

Stocks like gme are awesome for option writers. Not so much for the buyers."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Awesome, thanks a lot!"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thank you for the info. I dont have the capital to write options for gme but I am writing for his little brother, AMC :)"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Smart.

I have shied away from doing it. I feel like as soon as I write one, that will be the week when everything skyrockets!"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah always that possibility. I just pick a strike above my cost basis and high enough for some profit. I only write 1-2 weeks out. If it DOES skyrocket the volatility of these memestocks also gives it an equal chance to drop back below my strike before expiration
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,I remember a few months ago your account was nearly double. Ouch
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,How did it go for you mate ?
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"I ended up selling the shares at minuscule profit.  Seems like somebody with big pockets didnt want this hitting $9 this week.  Have some calls left I'm hoping will turn profitable with a spike Monday since it's the last day people can buy and get dividend.  

Too much money to be made elsewhere.  Buying the Es-El-Gee-Gee dip."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Seemed like someone with big pockets this week didnt want it hitting $9. Maybe they sold a bunch of calls.   Anyway, I sold all my shares at a penny or two above what I bought.  Hoping for a pre ex div date spike on Monday to offload some calls."
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,Understandable. Good luck brother! Probably getting out of my position as well on Monday. We stopped right at 8.99 AH. Hoping we spike fat above $9 and i can get out.
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Right on, sending you good profit vibes bro!"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hahahaha, good advice for guys! Psy-Ko is female ape ;)"
03/27/2021,wallstreetbets,What is your price prediction for next week. You got some good entry points?
