2021-04-20 19:51:01,wallstreetbets,Genious. We know how this will turn out
2021-04-20 19:35:53,wallstreetbets,Next few months/years of WSB is going to be people chasing anything that might remotely have a chance at a short squeeze and end up with most people bagholding some truly shit companies that got shorted for a reason.
2021-04-20 19:30:47,wallstreetbets,I went in for 3000 shares today.
2021-04-20 19:16:48,wallstreetbets,This is so sexy ☘️
2021-04-20 19:23:55,wallstreetbets,I resisted my retarded smooth brain primate instincts to throw money into CLOV and am now content with my hesitance. Ape proceed cautiously. Ape still searching for 🍌in ☘️
2021-04-20 19:17:09,wallstreetbets,"Gonna hold these and some calls I got next to my nuts, and carry the baggage.. if it hits $7 then maybe put my next pay check to buy another 2k more. Haven't learned my lesson."
2021-04-20 19:21:23,wallstreetbets,"Respected genious = shares 


Respected genius = calls"
2021-04-20 19:25:09,wallstreetbets,Chamath dumped his bags on ya.
2021-04-20 19:36:24,wallstreetbets,So if Vanguard has balls to buy 18% stake they have to know something! 🤷🏽‍♂️🍀

2021-04-20 19:25:32,wallstreetbets,I don’t have a penny in this and by the looks I never will
2021-04-20 19:18:05,wallstreetbets,Genius*
2021-04-20 19:41:56,wallstreetbets,Yes yes this is the way
2021-04-20 19:38:47,wallstreetbets,"Possibly but Chelsea, Ex director of CMS joining the team(the DOJ investigation was opened for breaking the CMS rules), idk these people are not fools."
2021-04-20 19:31:47,wallstreetbets,"I am adding 2700 more, payday Friday!"
2021-04-20 19:29:05,wallstreetbets,I will be buying 2700 shares more. I just have a feeling about Chelsea turning this around using her mommy's super powers.
2021-04-20 19:57:22,wallstreetbets,Verified retard
2021-04-20 19:22:31,wallstreetbets,"I got both! Some May calls, but this my biggest lump of change."
2021-04-20 19:29:40,wallstreetbets,Tbf Chamath can’t sell anything until july I think

2021-04-20 19:29:25,wallstreetbets,2700 more incoming
2021-04-20 19:18:27,wallstreetbets,"Cramer didn't do shit, the market is bust today! Other SPACs tanked hard too."
2021-04-20 19:23:49,wallstreetbets,"Cramer dissed MVIS. Everyone hyped it up and look at what happened today. I still get the long term potential of their product, but I’m talking today’s play."
2021-04-20 19:27:01,wallstreetbets,Will be missing you in the scamath storm.
2021-04-20 19:27:50,wallstreetbets,"Okay okay, retard I am, I know but I have decided to buy 2700 more shares just because... I never learn lesson."
2021-04-20 19:20:04,wallstreetbets,"That may have been the point, not sure"
2021-04-20 19:41:48,wallstreetbets,"I don't know about the particulars in this case, I'm just talking about how it seems like people here think seeing high short interest in a stock is the best sign that they should buy in."
2021-04-20 19:32:44,wallstreetbets,Good luck retard! I look forward to seeing your loss porn next to mine!
2021-04-20 19:38:20,wallstreetbets,"I’m rooting for you! Yesterday’s hype really had my wheels turning but I always see red after WSB hype. So for the first time, I just waited and watched. lol I’m a retard and love to spend my money wherever WSB wants me to spend it. 100% smooth brain, GME stroking ape speaking. I discovered a wrinkle yesterday. Might play with ☘️ tomorrow morning. Might do some ironing before market open"
2021-04-20 19:33:59,wallstreetbets,"That’s the limitation with SPACs, all these restrictions on when shares can be sold. Completely appropriate because half of these companies aren’t ready to go public, but if they can’t be sold, they can’t be part of the float. How much is really available and how much is short... it should be simple. Why is it not?"
2021-04-20 19:31:01,wallstreetbets,"Chamath won't sell this, is my opinion but again, he could scam me twice. Then the joke is on me. My wife will be pleased to see me dressed as a clown."
2021-04-20 19:41:03,wallstreetbets,"Right on brother, go go go 
You will do it yo"
2021-04-20 19:39:20,wallstreetbets,"> Everyone hyped it up and look at what happened today

It dropped only 1% after dropping like 40% in the last two weeks?"
2021-04-20 19:24:41,wallstreetbets,"Not much Money flowing, plot CLOV and SPY side by side for day chart, tell me what you see. It's clear."
2021-04-20 19:33:57,wallstreetbets,Don't double down on a losing play
2021-04-20 19:25:45,wallstreetbets,Looked at the mirror twice then went for a 6 mile run! Decided my next paycheck I will buy another 2700 shares.
2021-04-20 19:45:30,wallstreetbets,Okay so I went all in on three conditions 1. Short squeeze theory 2. A good news that should follow this directors onboarding! 3. Hindenshit sometimes makes up stories where there are none.
2021-04-20 19:34:29,wallstreetbets,Will drop the 10k pic shares here next week. Gotta wait for paycheck to be deposited.
2021-04-20 19:39:30,wallstreetbets,"I am doubling down, idk, when others fear I buy!"

2021-04-20 19:37:01,wallstreetbets,"Yeah it makes no sense for him to sell specially after his company gets so much attention, regardless there is money to be made with this company if it keeps growing and it is growing"
2021-04-20 19:29:31,wallstreetbets,"Hoping my guy. 500 shares because the math made sense initially. Can’t ever get correct data anywhere though, so idk if things have changed."
2021-04-20 19:35:09,wallstreetbets,Nah! From OTC markets I've learned that you just buy more and more.
2021-04-20 19:36:00,wallstreetbets,Maybe buy a couple puts to hedge
2021-04-20 19:36:47,wallstreetbets,I did today but let's see how this plays out.
2021-04-20 19:14:54,wallstreetbets,"BoA just gave them a $31 price target so you could be on the way.  I mean I think they did, I can barely read

2021-04-20 19:15:10,wallstreetbets,I saw they upped the PT to 32. Too bad it got above 14 and then stalled. I think you made a good play here. Good luck.
2021-04-20 19:03:20,wallstreetbets,Goals
2021-04-20 19:33:33,wallstreetbets,Fisker is more likely going the way of Nikola than Rivian or NIO.
2021-04-20 19:36:06,wallstreetbets,Makes me not feel so bad on my losses for 100 shares
2021-04-20 19:04:56,wallstreetbets,Fisker is still around? I remember their hybrid cars getting 20 miles a gallon lol
2021-04-20 19:47:45,wallstreetbets,Do you have any reasoning for that statement?
2021-04-20 19:07:37,wallstreetbets,New company gonna go the way of the old company
2021-04-20 19:59:20,wallstreetbets,"The price hasn’t even settled yet.

This is phenomenally stupid.

I love it."
2021-04-20 19:17:47,wallstreetbets,Went in on PYPL instead lol.
2021-04-20 19:53:14,wallstreetbets,You might be better off dumping all your money on BNB
2021-04-20 19:12:17,wallstreetbets,I don’t like the stock
2021-04-20 19:13:32,wallstreetbets,"Good luck man, I’m rooting for you!!"
2021-04-20 19:26:44,wallstreetbets,Remind me in 3 months
2021-04-20 19:30:45,wallstreetbets,Oh nice they have options now. Time to load up on puts. Ponzi schemes gunna ponzi.
2021-04-20 18:51:32,wallstreetbets,"Should have bought puts.
Business model not sustainable"
2021-04-20 18:55:03,wallstreetbets,It’s either you’ll be sleeping on the couch or sleeping in the Bugatti. Fair bet
2021-04-20 19:00:28,wallstreetbets,Send me $5k 👉👈
2021-04-20 18:54:34,wallstreetbets,"Wow. That's balsy, good luck to you!"
2021-04-20 18:59:35,wallstreetbets,This is going down. I’ll buy at $50

2021-04-20 19:01:20,wallstreetbets,oof
2021-04-20 19:36:47,wallstreetbets,PYPL MARA or RIOT are all better plays then COIN at its current price level. IMO. Prove me wrong. I’m rooting for you.
2021-04-20 18:56:06,wallstreetbets,Yikes
2021-04-20 19:21:26,wallstreetbets,Dammmn that’s hard

2021-04-20 19:01:09,wallstreetbets,Yes it is.
2021-04-20 19:11:34,wallstreetbets,Yeah not like it was a DPO or anything and basically the only way for people to buy into the company was for insiders to sell a portion of their shares as they have all the available shares 😴
2021-04-20 19:02:43,wallstreetbets,"Their projected profits are going to tank once they reduce their transaction fees from their absurd highs.
Perfect time to DPO and cash out"
2021-04-20 19:29:46,wallstreetbets,Who’s transaction fees? Coinbases 99 cent one ?😳😂
2021-04-20 18:48:20,wallstreetbets,"Try skiing, that seems to keep Karp relaxed."
2021-04-20 18:51:00,wallstreetbets,Same got in at $21.50 today. Will continue to buy if keeps dipping.
2021-04-20 19:35:10,wallstreetbets,This is the way.

2021-04-20 19:53:11,wallstreetbets,Huge puts on IWM also came today.
2021-04-20 18:42:18,wallstreetbets,"I'm not sure why visualmod thinks this is a shitstock, 27B seems correct for cap. hmm"
2021-04-20 19:46:58,wallstreetbets,"I agree with this move. I can’t do short sales, would much rather do that than buy puts."
2021-04-20 18:53:33,wallstreetbets,It's forecasting future market cap.
2021-04-20 19:59:43,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I looked at puts. Was not willing to pay the premium."
2021-04-20 18:31:23,wallstreetbets,Looks beautiful.  To achieve extraordinary achievements at such a young age.  True future autist.
2021-04-20 18:26:58,wallstreetbets,Your going to go far kid
2021-04-20 18:36:42,wallstreetbets,"Yes, you did a great job documenting losses. This is the way."
2021-04-20 19:02:14,wallstreetbets,Welcome home
2021-04-20 18:18:41,wallstreetbets,"21 years old, threw my money away over the past three months. Downfall started when I bought ARKK puts (month out) that would’ve been a 10 bagger if I held for a week... and then I bought TSLA fds sold a day before they also would’ve been a 10 bagger. After that yoloed half into sqqq puts and GME spreads, left with around half my account value at this point. Kinda stopped caring and yoloed everything and here we are today. No worries tho literary just a virtual number and I’ll make it back. Check back in 3 months for updated loss porn"
2021-04-20 18:42:27,wallstreetbets,Please let me know when you're scheduled to give your TED talk.

2021-04-20 18:34:51,wallstreetbets,"heh I hope I learn my lesson, better to lose 20k now than 200k in 5 years"
2021-04-20 18:41:02,wallstreetbets,That’s the attitude to have at 21. Got to learn somehow. You will be better off for it in the long run.
2021-04-20 18:46:21,wallstreetbets,My next play was gonna be spy puts so spy 450 by eom.
2021-04-20 18:03:14,wallstreetbets,Big balls oof play. Respect

2021-04-20 18:05:41,wallstreetbets,Not sure why you even bought CLOV?!?!!
2021-04-20 19:22:59,wallstreetbets,Im down -1750 last time I looked. But thats just because I have tiny balls and a tinier wallet so I only bought 32 21May 21 12.5c. All good though. Got 30 more days. If the trade doesnt go my way by next week Ill likely roll it
2021-04-20 18:51:06,wallstreetbets,Chamath doing you dirty?  [You missed the signs](https://youtu.be/Cdj5KOxJZS4)

2021-04-20 18:24:17,wallstreetbets,"I wanna park my money with limited downside and good upside with momentum ..

From peak of +$160k , portfolio lost by -50k in a month .

I don't want to play like Oct-2020 to Feb-2021 .

I need a break - I never mind losing my entire capital too.

This account up from 30k to 160k to 110k to 95k in last 5 months ."
2021-04-20 18:28:02,wallstreetbets,Ok if you have free money to play with I guess 🤷🏼‍♂️

2021-04-20 18:58:18,wallstreetbets,Next Stimulus? You know something we don’t?
2021-04-20 17:36:58,wallstreetbets,Are we getting a 4th stimmy?
2021-04-20 17:16:36,wallstreetbets,Ape makes own stimmy.
2021-04-20 18:52:11,wallstreetbets,"Do you like webull. People talk shit on it, but transfering from RH, I cant complain."
2021-04-20 18:13:14,wallstreetbets,You just got me stimulated
2021-04-20 17:29:00,wallstreetbets,Won't be another stimulus check.  Companies are struggling to find people right now.  Its a way to force us back to these shitty jobs.
2021-04-20 17:33:32,wallstreetbets,I think that is going to be when they cut off unemployment. Stimulus isn’t stopping people from working. It’s just giving them extra cash.
2021-04-20 19:53:35,wallstreetbets,"Another stimulus🤔huh. Another one is coming; 4? 
APE fling cow chip"

2021-04-20 19:17:39,wallstreetbets,No 4th check for vets. Va sent out a emailer that stated 4th check coming. They should have said 4th distribution of checks. For the ones that fell through the cracks of the 3rd stimmy.
2021-04-20 19:25:20,wallstreetbets,Seems very safe!
2021-04-20 19:29:54,wallstreetbets,All of it

2021-04-20 18:52:19,wallstreetbets,"I'm not American, what is a stimulus cheque, sounds like free money and I'm jealous"
2021-04-20 19:37:24,wallstreetbets,Keep printing that moneeyyy. Whats the worst that can happen? Oh wait total economic collapse. Eh keep printing anyway.
2021-04-20 19:42:19,wallstreetbets,We get another stimulus news to me?!
2021-04-20 18:31:22,wallstreetbets,Still haven't seen my 3rd one yet. No date has been posted per the irs website. Probably have to claim it on my 2021 income tax like the 2nd one.
2021-04-20 19:31:13,wallstreetbets,"As someone who pays taxes and agrees with stimulus payments because they allow people to pay for necessities and to stimulate the economy, I ask that you return the money.

2021-04-20 17:28:46,wallstreetbets,"Theres been talks of another round, but nothing solid yet."
2021-04-20 18:06:52,wallstreetbets,"No fking clue man. Don’t know if we being played or double played. Or double double played. At this point I need to stay off the subreddits, hold, and pray."

2021-04-20 17:26:17,wallstreetbets,GME outlawed here now bruh.

2021-04-20 18:48:39,wallstreetbets,that’s webull
2021-04-20 18:22:59,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-04-20 19:00:05,wallstreetbets,It’s when the government sends you some money that they got from taxing you earlier
2021-04-20 18:33:35,wallstreetbets,I’m a veteran ...at losing money
2021-04-20 18:50:09,wallstreetbets,Wb active? 😌😌
2021-04-20 19:38:09,wallstreetbets,"Biden gives us all checks, we use them to stack more gme. Gme squeezes, we get taxed up the ass. Govt profits. BIG BRAIN TIME"
2021-04-20 19:46:41,wallstreetbets,Why the fuck am I working lmao
2021-04-20 18:01:51,wallstreetbets,[removed]
2021-04-20 19:39:58,wallstreetbets,"I agree, I just figured there would be more comments"
2021-04-20 19:55:27,wallstreetbets,"Well if they allow posts about GME we can definitely comment about GME on those posts then... right? 


I like the way op invests. 


#GME"
2021-04-20 18:49:24,wallstreetbets,Thank you 🙏
2021-04-20 19:10:42,wallstreetbets,"Ohhh okay. They call it a GST cheque in Canada, seems like the same thing then but ours are like 160$ every 3 months."
2021-04-20 18:51:02,wallstreetbets,Oof... I felt that.
2021-04-20 18:56:24,wallstreetbets,I'm a veteran... of losing entirely
2021-04-20 19:12:35,wallstreetbets,Lol.  I'm both.  :)
2021-04-20 18:54:18,wallstreetbets,Not for boots
2021-04-20 18:11:52,wallstreetbets,Sir this is a casino
2021-04-20 18:59:19,wallstreetbets,I work in construction and we never shut down lol I’d say that’s pretty solidly middle class
2021-04-20 18:08:54,wallstreetbets,You are a fucking idiot.
2021-04-20 19:19:38,wallstreetbets,"You're right the NWO is descending upon us at the speed of light. But let them sell their souls out for a check it will turn out well for them in the end. They are mainly creating a 2 tier system that will end in an oligarchy. Humans have been warned for decades but they need to learn the hard way. Their problem, you just exist the matrix as fast as you can, and save your soul and don't look back, its likely gonna get ugly fast. 

There is also something called Prior Choice Economics that could end this debacle and bring an age of prosperity along with fusion energy which can power the entire planet, but people are not ready for that, it kicks UBI in the ass, and doesn't turn people into beggars, quiet the opposite. Government never gives anything for free, and nothing is free, the money has to come from somewhere, and you can't eat money,  inflation and prices are already skyrocketing, and we still have to produce to survive, farmers are needed, doctors are needed, construction workers, plumbers, garbage workers, e.t.c. Its a fact of life. Homesteaders are ahead of the game, as they largely produce many of their necessities on their own, I suggest building your own communities and becoming as self sufficient as possible."
2021-04-20 19:15:11,wallstreetbets,"Kind of. That seems more like a tax refund, lower income brackets get some of their withholding refunded

Stimulus is like a one time stipend “given” to everyone, but people forget that it comes from their federal taxes that they pay in the first place."
2021-04-20 19:10:58,wallstreetbets,"I call them ""moral victories."""
2021-04-20 19:10:35,wallstreetbets,"I'm a rancher, shut down for what."
2021-04-20 18:16:38,wallstreetbets,Only type I fuck
2021-04-20 18:52:20,wallstreetbets,"And not the good kind of idiot, like us apes"
2021-04-20 19:32:27,wallstreetbets,I want whatever this ape is smoking
2021-04-20 19:39:27,wallstreetbets,This guy fucks!
2021-04-20 19:37:55,wallstreetbets,"Enjoy your degeneration. I could care less. My soul is free, thats all I am smoking, spiritual awareness, you are still a sheep a beggar that needs to bully rather than seek. Every time you loosers just talk shit but present nothing of value its pathetic and boring. Yet everything we have been talking about for a long time is coming to light and right in your face. Enjoy, we will be waiting on the other side, and all you will get from me is an I told you so, I will not be nice, I'll leave that to the airy fairys, go suck on their bosoms, you will be licking our boots and begging for our assistance when chaos descends further, they are already talking about nuclear war, and its no joke straight from the military enjoy! We told you all last year we are in a similar place prior to WW2 if you read history it would be clear as day and on the verge of genocide once again, and its already occurring in other places."
2021-04-20 19:41:39,wallstreetbets,Name checks out... you certainly are a charmer
2021-04-20 19:42:44,wallstreetbets,"Indeed I am. I cut the bull shit quick, don't have time for phony stuff."
2021-04-20 19:45:43,wallstreetbets,"Judging by your tenuous grasp on reality and delusions of nauseating Q laden dribble, I'd probably make the argument that your time is filled with nothing but ""phony stuff"""
2021-04-20 19:47:56,wallstreetbets,"Oh please here goes another looser, the first time he heard anything about the matrix is when MSM told you about Q you are hilarious. Buddy some of us have been in the game for DECADES. Q came in 2017. Grow up. When the red pills rain on you, you won't know what to do with yourself."
2021-04-20 19:55:47,wallstreetbets,Let me guess what shape you think the earth is
2021-04-20 19:59:27,wallstreetbets,"I believe the word you're looking for is ""loser"". As opposed to ""looser"", which is what your ass is after your wife's boyfriend gets drunk and accidently wanders into your room. This, of course, assumes that any red blooded mammal could stomach you long enough to make any sort of commitment. I'll give you the benefit of the doubt though."
2021-04-20 16:42:26,wallstreetbets,"Buy for $378, sell for $61 and buy again for $157. This is the way!"
2021-04-20 17:39:45,wallstreetbets,"Brutal.  You should switch the app to Dark Theme, more of a somber tone might be appropriate"
2021-04-20 17:02:30,wallstreetbets,Looks normal to me.
2021-04-20 16:54:14,wallstreetbets,Your in the spectrum but you have clearly demonstrated your ability to use buttons
2021-04-20 16:44:21,wallstreetbets,"That’s crazy ...you sold @61 for almost $250k loss, and bought back at $157?? You sir are a Legend!!"
2021-04-20 16:40:50,wallstreetbets,Buy high Sell Low you already know how it goes in the planet of the apes
2021-04-20 16:44:07,wallstreetbets,Yes. Not because you bought high but because you want to draw interest with your paper account
2021-04-20 17:39:01,wallstreetbets,You sir are the definition of retard.
2021-04-20 17:47:06,wallstreetbets,Now I feel less retarded for selling ITM $100 covered call that I have to work my way out of.
2021-04-20 16:40:56,wallstreetbets,buy high sell low
2021-04-20 16:52:19,wallstreetbets,"U actually made the worst moves possible, that requires some skill. Youll be a millionaire soon so i wouldnt worry."
2021-04-20 16:42:05,wallstreetbets,Yes. Carry on.
2021-04-20 16:38:33,wallstreetbets,"You are what you are..... no more, no less."
2021-04-20 16:58:06,wallstreetbets,What about today convinced you to buy back?
2021-04-20 19:12:07,wallstreetbets,Are you fucking retarded? You’re my hero!
2021-04-20 16:42:38,wallstreetbets,"-$54.8K, hmm at least you still have you dignity?

2021-04-20 17:08:13,wallstreetbets,"Don't be so hard on yourself, I think it's just a case of dyslexia -

It's buy *LOW*, sell *HIGH*..."
2021-04-20 19:52:12,wallstreetbets,"You, sir/mam, are beautiful and a true inspiration to us all."
2021-04-20 16:39:01,wallstreetbets,"BEAST - thank you for you service. Keep on buying and holding, buying and holding!"
2021-04-20 19:00:26,wallstreetbets,"That's alright, hold tight now don't paper hand. You tell make back all your loses on this one."

2021-04-20 17:37:44,wallstreetbets,Great strategy if you need a huge tax write off..
2021-04-20 17:41:42,wallstreetbets,"Ah yes, a fellow gorillonare in the making"
2021-04-20 18:04:57,wallstreetbets,lmao
2021-04-20 18:09:55,wallstreetbets,Yup. Looks retarded to me.
2021-04-20 18:10:47,wallstreetbets,not a loss till sold like last time..
2021-04-20 18:12:51,wallstreetbets,You should definitely start a YouTube channel of how NOT to invest lol
2021-04-20 18:13:13,wallstreetbets,Literally only fucking bought high! My guy!
2021-04-20 18:28:56,wallstreetbets,"Haha, why do you buy high and sell low and buy high again?"
2021-04-20 18:35:25,wallstreetbets,You went full retard. Well done.
2021-04-20 18:36:59,wallstreetbets,"In fairness, you have still manged to average down, Im just not sure you read the full instructions."

2021-04-20 19:28:55,wallstreetbets,"Jesus, did you actually have a reason for doing this or did your 'one to one' just forget to sedate you when Thomas the tank engine came on?"
2021-04-20 19:31:28,wallstreetbets,As long as you sell more below 157.05. For this is the way.
2021-04-20 19:37:36,wallstreetbets,Yes
2021-04-20 19:40:28,wallstreetbets,ya did gud
2021-04-20 19:49:49,wallstreetbets,Worthy of a screenshot
2021-04-20 16:57:19,wallstreetbets,"#buy high and sell low  
  
That is my retard way, I’m going to be the next h0kaGe"
2021-04-20 18:02:50,wallstreetbets,I think you’d be a detriment to the rest of us holding
2021-04-20 19:16:04,wallstreetbets,Nope. You good if you hold.
2021-04-20 17:24:47,wallstreetbets,Trigger a wash sale and make the Tax man rich(er) while he's at it 🤦‍♂️
2021-04-20 17:30:03,wallstreetbets,"This is the way! 
I did nearly the same."
2021-04-20 17:09:28,wallstreetbets,No. „Only“ for a loss of around 100k. This smart ape only sold 520 shares @61.
2021-04-20 18:16:09,wallstreetbets,"All jokes aside, I just can't fathom doing that. If it dips while you're holding, just wait (and buy more). Why tf would you **sell** that low?"
2021-04-20 18:14:18,wallstreetbets,"I think you misunderstand what a wash sale is.

Losses are allowed unless you’re holding into a new tax year.

This is a common misconception due to new investors flooding in.

Edit: day trader here"
2021-04-20 17:19:59,wallstreetbets,"Oh yes, missed that important info - sold only half his position at @61. Still, that’s a true retard ape!!"
2021-04-20 18:17:30,wallstreetbets,I thought when sold at a loss and buying back the same stock or similar withing 31 days triggers a wash sale?
2021-04-20 18:19:50,wallstreetbets,"This is the best explanation I can find for some reason.

https://www.reddit.com/r/tax/comments/io0o07/why_are_people_so_scared_of_wash_sales/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

If you are holding that stock into the new tax year, yea. If you liquidate the problematic stocks by December you’d be fine."
2021-04-20 19:36:25,wallstreetbets,"Hey guys, despite the upvote/downvote ratio.. the gooch is right here. Only correction is it’s 30 days. If you sold a stock for a loss and bought a substantially similar security within 30 days, you cannot claim that initial loss on your taxes."
2021-04-20 19:45:24,wallstreetbets,I like that your reasonable explanation has quickly headed into negative karma territory as well.  People are smart
2021-04-20 16:56:43,wallstreetbets,2 post karma? Mods wtf...
2021-04-20 17:58:55,wallstreetbets,Expiry?
2021-04-20 17:23:29,wallstreetbets,This sub has gone downhill lmao
2021-04-20 16:47:41,wallstreetbets,"I sold some shares today, so you should be green tomorrow."
2021-04-20 17:32:18,wallstreetbets,I tripled my MVIS position today! Let’s get it!
2021-04-20 18:31:12,wallstreetbets,Yes this is the way
2021-04-20 17:55:57,wallstreetbets,For each upvote I get I’ll buy a share of MVIS. I’ve got $300 and ready to use it all
2021-04-20 16:47:23,wallstreetbets,I'm with you on this one. Buyout or News could trigger short squeeze.  I believe in it and I believe in you!!!!  I may love you!!!  I DO LOVE YOU!!!!!
2021-04-20 17:37:54,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-04-20 18:14:17,wallstreetbets,"How do you only have 16 karma points in a yr time.. most of them from this post.?

Tons of MVis stuff the past couple days wonder why..?"
2021-04-20 19:58:27,wallstreetbets,Balls or stupidity.   Well. Those aren’t mutually exclusive.   Stay tuned.  👀
2021-04-20 16:40:28,wallstreetbets,Seems to me you are in quick sand.
2021-04-20 18:14:18,wallstreetbets,MODS are on lunch break. And cramer's minions are pushing this MVIS. FU Cramer
2021-04-20 16:59:41,wallstreetbets,"Paired with my not buying, this stock is a sure winner"
2021-04-20 17:59:26,wallstreetbets,I downvoted you to save you some money.
2021-04-20 19:39:02,wallstreetbets,Yep i don’t have any stock in this company which means it will blow up and become the next Tesla....
2021-04-20 17:31:53,wallstreetbets,Our lack of support will send this to Mars. You’re welcome for our loss!
2021-04-20 18:00:40,wallstreetbets,Fuck what should I buy then
2021-04-20 18:25:57,wallstreetbets,"and someone else upvoted you, so should you stay? tHiS iS nOt FiNaNcIaL aDvIcE"

2021-04-20 19:13:12,wallstreetbets,"If they were 7 day out calls you'd be underwater, you own that and it's not going to 0, it's a healthy investment."
2021-04-20 17:08:16,wallstreetbets,Imagine if you did the opposite.
2021-04-20 17:22:40,wallstreetbets,"Sorry man, I lost as well"
2021-04-20 16:32:20,wallstreetbets,Today was so gay man

2021-04-20 16:51:08,wallstreetbets,I guess 17 was not the floor
2021-04-20 18:27:23,wallstreetbets,It’s tough sledding on weed lately. I cut my losses bc I’m afraid she’s gonna run back down to $9. If she starts showing life I’ll be back tho!
2021-04-20 16:36:07,wallstreetbets,Ouch
2021-04-20 18:14:28,wallstreetbets,You could’ve bought a Tesla
2021-04-20 17:21:53,wallstreetbets,That literally coulda been like 80mm from GME.
2021-04-20 17:36:39,wallstreetbets,Thanks. I’ll see what happens after the merger. I’ve thought about averaging down but I can’t get myself to keep throwing money at this.
2021-04-20 19:34:37,wallstreetbets,How can you say that without triangles or crayons

2021-04-20 18:25:48,wallstreetbets,Is it possible to learn this power ?
2021-04-20 17:51:32,wallstreetbets,Am I reading this right? 90b market cap with no dividends? Wtf?
2021-04-20 16:57:20,wallstreetbets,Jesus that theta
2021-04-20 16:35:11,wallstreetbets,This is the shit I wanna see. Godspeed.
2021-04-20 16:57:21,wallstreetbets,"Obvs Elon gonna say it was off, but why would they not be sitting in drivers seat with autopilot “off”.... it was most likely on"
2021-04-20 16:23:56,wallstreetbets,Wow that’s ballsy .
2021-04-20 19:11:02,wallstreetbets,Wayyyyyyyy too poor for options. I just scrape by doing my part slowly buying shares
2021-04-20 16:38:51,wallstreetbets,Options are already too expensive no thx
2021-04-20 17:06:21,wallstreetbets,"I think the argument is it couldn’t be on under those circumstances on that road with that vehicle. It couldn’t be going that fast, it needed someone in the driver’s seat, and it needed hands on the wheel. Also the level of autopilot in question wasn’t installed on that Model S. Evidence seems to be pointing towards a third person in the car who ran."
2021-04-20 19:22:00,wallstreetbets,car won’t run without someone in drivers seat and hands on wherl
2021-04-20 18:45:48,wallstreetbets,That’s no way to get flaired.
2021-04-20 17:19:44,wallstreetbets,Ohhh that’s an interesting theory. Owner lets dumb friend drive for first time. Hotrods it right into a tree and then bails out.  I’d put my money on the first person who called 9-1-1 being involved.
2021-04-20 17:30:51,wallstreetbets,I haven't seen any reports about the seat belt situation. Has the possibility been considered that the person in the back seat is the driver who got his ass yeeted into the back during the accident?
2021-04-20 17:42:51,wallstreetbets,"Unsure but how it is questioned is impossible without gross user negligence by at the very least tricking the safety systems with weights, buckled seatbelts, and still touching the wheel several times per minute."
2021-04-20 19:11:28,wallstreetbets,"Usually when you run into a tree you yeet forward, not backwards. Don’t ask me how I know that."
2021-04-20 17:44:53,wallstreetbets,This whole story is a bunch of garbage coming from anti-tech Texas law enforcement. They just want to blame them new-fangled electronical computer-powered cars.
2021-04-20 19:36:09,wallstreetbets,"You know that because you retain your speed, while the car is accelerated into ""the negative"" of your direction. Physics."
2021-04-20 19:46:42,wallstreetbets,yeahhhh texans ain't too bright
2021-04-20 16:53:29,wallstreetbets,Nice

2021-04-20 16:28:23,wallstreetbets,It’s insanity that this is the first Netflix post 20 min after earnings were released. 2-3 years ago there would be 16 Netflix earnings threads with all the details.

2021-04-20 16:15:07,wallstreetbets,Prob because they dont add shit
2021-04-20 16:23:52,wallstreetbets,"I’m from the EU so I have no idea how the situation is over there in the US. However, here Prime video is free with Amazon prime and the Prime itself is cheap as chips. Like, I pay 18€ per year and I have free shipping plus free Prime Video and a bunch of other benefits. Not to mention Prime Video offering of third party series and films is far superior to what is available on Netflix, which is basically mostly Netflix exclusives and not much else, and at a fraction of the cost. To add to that, there’s this weird trend of subscribing to Disney+, which to my mind makes little sense since Netflix has so much more content, and they are also stealing subscribers from Netflix. From my own overseas POV, I could see this slowdown coming from miles away, at least in my country, and I suppose the situation in the rest of the EU isn’t that different. Competition is getting too good and very cheap quite fast. If I’m not particularly interested in watching Netflix exclusives, you gotta give me a good reason to pay a monthly fee instead of using Prime Video"

2021-04-20 17:48:44,wallstreetbets,Not a holder (other than through ARKK/X)  - This is one of those times I should have listened to my gut and then made stock predictions.  For the last year I've been asking my fam if we should cancel Netflix because no-one watches it.   We do a lot of Amazon and Disney+.  I went on the other night didn't recognize much.  Nothing there has grabbed my attention lately.  No real point to my post... just blabbing for the sake of blabbing.
2021-04-20 18:43:19,wallstreetbets,They’ve lost so much interesting content. It’s no wonder. I’ve found more on Hulu and Disney to watch it late.
2021-04-20 16:15:50,wallstreetbets,"Color me surprised. I would think with camera fatigue during the pandemic everyone would be binging more Netflix.

I find that Prime Video has so much more stuff available. If you aren’t interested in Netflix exclusives, Netflix is not the way to go I feel like.

10/10 do not understand Netflix hype and never will

Edit: 👇🏼 forgot about Disney+. I do have kids and they never want to watch Netflix. Always Hulu. They enjoyed Disney+ but I had too many services so I trimmed it for the past while, plus no xbox anymore"
2021-04-20 16:24:44,wallstreetbets,"Disney has a lot of long term subs locked in with bundles and yearly discounts, so it's not apples-apples. Netflix is outright profitable and still growing (albeit slower); Disney+ is not profitable unto itself (for now), and we don't know what retention looks like for them yet."
2021-04-20 16:29:59,wallstreetbets,"You really gonna convince me that Ozark, Stranger Things, Black Mirror, Knives Out (TBC), The Witcher, The Crown and Love Death & Robots are shit? Dude, maybe try something other than rewatching The Office."

2021-04-20 16:32:41,wallstreetbets,"I really like the UK selection, at least I did when I could easily go about it with a free VPN, I love British comedy. But yes, Prime is really good. Disney+ is decent but honestly very overrated."
2021-04-20 16:56:37,wallstreetbets,"all the movies they have are trash or I have already seen on Prime, which is a mere side effect of free shipping."

2021-04-20 16:31:37,wallstreetbets,they can still add old movies. DOH!
2021-04-20 17:09:54,wallstreetbets,actually the one good thing on Netflix these days are Korean dramas and guess what? those were being shot nonstop even during pandemic. at worst you see characters handling food with plastic mouth covers.
2021-04-20 17:23:26,wallstreetbets,"Italy. The cost would be 36€/year. But with students discount I get 50% off, so I only pay 18€. Pretty sick deal not gonna lie."
2021-04-20 16:52:59,wallstreetbets,"Where are you from exactly? I don’t have a subscription to prime video, it’s free with the Amazon prime annual fee."
2021-04-20 16:52:01,wallstreetbets,"True, I don’t. Keep in mind over here streaming is nowhere near as prominent as in the US, and there is still a vast majority of people watching TV instead, lots of content there even for kids. Many families for example have SKY because that’s where you watch sports, and there’s also a lot of kids content on there. I can easily afford to have multiple subscriptions, but if I could only afford one, Disney would be a clear 4th choice (sky is also a cable tv subscription)"
2021-04-20 16:48:00,wallstreetbets,My toddler learned to say all of the mickey mouse clubhouse characters names in a day and still cant say his own. Disney+ is a godsend for parents lol.
2021-04-20 17:12:42,wallstreetbets,"I seriously want to invest in Disney stocks for the facts of Disney plus and before the theme parks open again. I'm an ape with ZERO experience trading and earned £140 off the second squeeze on GME - looking at Netflix stock rise when they switched from DVD renting (fuck those days lol) and then buying over lovefilm sent the stock to where it is now. 

Once again I would like to declare - I know fuck all about anything of this funny gambling thing we all do"
2021-04-20 16:55:18,wallstreetbets,"You have kids = you have Disney+ for at least 10 years I suppose

You are an adult = you have multiple choices, Netflix is not a monopoly"
2021-04-20 16:37:06,wallstreetbets,"Black mirror is not a Netflix original. The first seasons have been produced by a British tv channel and it’s the best seasons. The crown is one of their first original creation and at that time Netflix was good. Stranger things last season was a joke. 

I’m talking about their newest originals everything is shit"
2021-04-20 19:30:34,wallstreetbets,Should include bojack. One of their absolute best originals imo.

2021-04-20 16:58:05,wallstreetbets,"should have always been FAAMG

Netflix' business model is nothing special, that's why we see so much competition.

Apple could have just bought all the old content due to their deep pockets and Netflix would have been in even more trouble - AMZN does exactly that, to a lesser extent - and offers many more benefits on top"
2021-04-20 16:35:51,wallstreetbets,"Probably right, but FAANG are the old men on the hill now. It's like no one blinks when Citi takes a tumble: the fundamentals are pretty well understood."
2021-04-20 16:41:23,wallstreetbets,"HBO delayed a lot of their 2020 slate so they could trickle out some things. Also, HBO doesn't drop shows the same way Netflix does because they match it to broadcasts.

Also, Netflix is [releasing a movie a week all this year](https://www.thrillist.com/entertainment/nation/netflix-releasing-a-movie-a-week-in-2021)."
2021-04-20 18:02:17,wallstreetbets,a lot was already in the can
2021-04-20 16:34:37,wallstreetbets,This is the reason Im no longer a subscriber. At some point they stopped adding the movies i wanted and just kept pushing their shows.
2021-04-20 16:58:32,wallstreetbets,"germany. I don't know honestly, maybe I have also just the prime annual fee, but i can watch movies and listen to music - the shitty thing is, that a lot of movies are only in german, there is the option sometimes to get the original version by paying some extra fee - never tried."
2021-04-20 18:25:21,wallstreetbets,They added the Star section which has more mature content. I have seen 3 female breasts on Disney+ and I'll never get over it.
2021-04-20 17:12:04,wallstreetbets,I know every episode of that show lol.
2021-04-20 17:33:26,wallstreetbets,"Disney is going to do exactly what they did at the parks, get everyone hooked and then dramatically jack up the price. I'm talking $30 a month within 5 years. People will bitch and moan but it's still the cheapest kid babysitter around.

I don't think netflix has much risk losing subs for disney. I think people would cut other services first."
2021-04-20 16:48:58,wallstreetbets,"So true, the OG Netflix originals were why I subscribed in the first place. All the new ones are dreadful 

Now I just watch everything on bflix lol"
2021-04-20 19:31:50,wallstreetbets,I prefer FAGMAN
2021-04-20 19:24:37,wallstreetbets,"I seriously never understood how the hell Netflix got in over microsoft for the tech behemoths. Like have you ever been in an office before, they use microsoft. Netflix is going down, it'll take a while but like their shows get worse and worse and then they raise the price to make more content that sucks and they cancel the good ones anyways. They have no moat and will lose most of their market share imo. They dont even have the brainless watching the office is my personality cult anymore."
2021-04-20 16:43:22,wallstreetbets,"They have gone all in on their proprietary shows, and to be fair, quite a few of them are good.  But they will have to do better in keeping peoples interest if they intend on continuing the 8-10 episode a year model.   When 90% of their platform is objectively garbage filler, at some point, and I'm suprised this hasn't already begun, you'll see spikes in subs when shows are released followed by quick cancelations."
2021-04-20 17:02:34,wallstreetbets,Prime Video sucks big time. Not being able to watch the original version and being forced to listen to bad German sync makes it easier to just get a VPN and torrent
2021-04-20 17:07:48,wallstreetbets,"Oh I see. I’m from Italy, we tend to watch things dubbed and honestly despite understanding spoken english perfectly I prefer the dubbed version 99% of the time. Apparently our dubbers are some of the best in the world at their job, and I can see why, because they usually add a lot of value to average actors. Often when I try to listen to the original version, especially in random series, I cringe at bad acting and lack of emotion in the tone of the voice, the dubbers make it much better if the actors aren’t really good to begin. Never really tried watching stuff in the original language on Prime, we probably have the same paywall issue over here to be honest. It’s not a big deal for me, but I can definitely see your point if you have to pay extra for it."
2021-04-20 17:40:38,wallstreetbets,"Mickey Mouse (Shorts) and Wonderful World of Mickey Mouse are both wildly more entertaining. Definitely not as educational, but I at least feel entertained. We sprinkle it in with Clubhouse for a break.

We also watch Pixar shorts before bedtime, calms them down before bed pretty good."

Each SHARE goes for a bit over $1,300 an option (call or put in the money goes for $7K - $8K) Once they report the IV will head downwards and so will the price of options.

Anyway they are going in to earnings very hot and most likely will either miss on top or bottom or at least provide shitty guidance.  The beauty of this trade is you can go in after they report.  They kill it on earnings we done.  However almost sure they won’t and they don’t just collapse like Netflix did today. Normally it’s a gradual but deep correction.

2021-04-20 18:05:38,wallstreetbets,As far as content and UI Netflix wins IMO.  People trying to get their kids to fuck off for an hour or two is why Disney+ is taking market share.

Sorry but the responsability is on you. Buy a better laptop and learn to save on the cloud or do backups.
2021-04-20 19:49:36,wallstreetbets,You prob shoulda backed it up. Not totally her fault but doing it a second time should take a lot less time

2021-04-20 16:27:21,wallstreetbets,I think its just pre LOTR and Hobbit. Id love to see a studio remaster the trilogy though with more modern cgi. It still holds up well except for the cave trolls and Gollum looks a bit cgi smooth.
2021-04-20 16:45:04,wallstreetbets,Why would you buy calls on a stock that trades for $7. Just buy shares

My gut tells me that CLOV isn't where I want to be still...but I have a lot of SoFi.  I feel extremely confident in SoFi as a business, so I'm going to double down there.  Whomever is shorting CLOV is also knocking SoFi down.  If they end up covering, they'll probably cover SoFi at the same time.  That one is extremely undervalued at the moment as well, without the DOJ cloud overhead."

There is no reason imo to continue shorting a stock when it has lost over 50% of its value and is in the single digits. At that point, you have very limited profit potential and massive loss potential. Especially when you and your buddies get to a point that you're using just about every share available for lending."

2021-04-20 19:06:13,wallstreetbets,"The CEO's shares thing is actually a misconception. His shares are Class B, not Class A, so they aren't included in float in the first place.

2021-04-20 15:57:41,wallstreetbets,"Man, would be great to hear some kind of update like that to give this fuel. It could even be that we see earnings serve as the catalyst next month.

I'm a little wary of earnings because every stock I held through earnings last quarter just got hammered, even on good news (IMMR, TGT, and CVS). I was especially bitter about TGT given that it reached new all-time highs like a couple of weeks after my calls expired. Lol.

So it might even be that we see another massive selloff/short push after earnings take this back down to the $7 support and then see this rise. Hence why I might move my May call back to June or July."
2021-04-20 16:56:22,wallstreetbets,I can think of at least 1 stock thats shorted a whoooole lot more.
2021-04-20 16:04:30,wallstreetbets,"Thanks! The util rate is what really gets me. It speaks to a larger proportion of ""active"" shares on loan than the float % itself can show. 

GME's util rate is only like 55% at this point and we all know it's still pretty massively shorted. I also just looked up AMC's and it's a whopping 99%, but I am looking to get back into AMC after it has another push down given how much they diluted the stock this year. I have a few shares still, but nothing like the big play I made from $5 in Jan."
2021-04-20 19:26:46,wallstreetbets,Da fuck? Promising? It’s down 11% and market was down 1%

2021-04-20 18:55:55,wallstreetbets,"Yea, that was pretty irresponsible of them and had a big resounding impact. I think there would be a case for a fine/prosecution."
2021-04-20 17:30:48,wallstreetbets,Woot! All I have to say is careful with the May options. Maybe diversify the time frames a bit. But those shares will be gains no matter what time-frame this thing moves up in! Almost a guaranteed profit eventually imo.
2021-04-20 18:41:04,wallstreetbets,Thanks! 😄
2021-04-20 17:28:09,wallstreetbets,"I mean, right now it's got a larger profit potential than a lot of the other things hyped in here. Lol."
2021-04-20 16:55:46,wallstreetbets,"I think a lot of the so-called ""meme stocks"" were just empty plays. That's why I only played GME and AMC, and I about doubled my acct for the small part I played in that. Lol.

Similarly, I don't think CLOV is just a ""meme stock"" and that there is plenty of substance on this oversold stock as well. It's really similar to AMC for me. Sure, the shorts might have initially been okay, justified, or even entirely correct. But at this point, they're just greedy if they're still in and are over their skis in risk."
2021-04-20 16:18:04,wallstreetbets,"Source on that? The only one that I can find that might be higher is PUBM or ASO, which are both supposedly around 50%. But sources like MarketWatch place CLOV in like the top 10 with 35% of float shorted, based on outdated data from the bi-monthly short reports.

Ortex actually keeps an attempted live calc and has their short float at 43% (which doesn't even account for the locked-up insider shares in that float calc)."
2021-04-20 16:56:53,wallstreetbets,"To what, $6? $7? I've held much worse bags than that which worked out in the end. Haha."
2021-04-20 18:14:00,wallstreetbets,"You do realize that the GME short float percent is only like 32% now, right? I'm interested in making money reliably over time. That requires diversification, along with taking profits at points.

I find it ironic that GME purists who probably didn't even join the trade until >$20 tell me to stop distracting from GME when I actually participated in the run-up from like $3 last year. Lol."

2021-04-20 17:37:59,wallstreetbets,I still don’t understand long term short positions. It seems like something that would be more useful for scalping volatility. I’m assuming that’s because I don’t have enough money to even consider being short for long term. I’ve been on and off studying investing for maybe 5-6 years now and it’s just mind-blowing how many real rules are in place to protect the wealthy and discourage the poor from even stepping in. I mean... wtf is going on
2021-04-20 17:14:06,wallstreetbets,"If you read or watch some of the DD around naked short selling, FTDs, and selling of fake shares, it becomes obvious why and how they still short sale even when the price is already below $10. They sell a product they never intend to deliver, and if a company becomes worthless/bankrupt then no one cares to hold them accountable if they sold a billion shares (in a company that has only issued 1M shares) at an average price of $1 cause they don't have to cover the short position. They are free to take the $1B to hoard and continue the market manipulation while every employee, owner, shareholder, and creditor takes the loss from the fraud."
2021-04-20 16:23:24,wallstreetbets,"Exactly, they haven't learned this simple risk management concept..  they face more potential loss than gain at a certain point and they are way beyond that."
2021-04-20 18:49:11,wallstreetbets,"LOL. Think whatever conspiracies you want. I've had this Reddit acct for years and have posted elsewhere also. And you can see my previous markup activity in Tradingview, also under @haylettc, where I have a pretty solid history."
2021-04-20 16:05:15,wallstreetbets,"Yes, any positive catalyst would be great!

I think the $6-7 level is our margin of safety. It’s hard to see how this falls lower than that.

One thing which stresses me a bit is come July, there will be whole lot of shares coming out of lockup."

No one wants to invest in someone who dumped their own stock in a previous company and killed that investment opportunity."
2021-04-20 17:42:34,wallstreetbets,"By roughly half in Dec/Jan (from 150 million shares outstanding to 450 million shares outstanding) and now voted to dilute again by an additional 500 million shares (although they've said they won't issue them in 2021).

So whatever the value per share was at the end of 2020, the new value per share is going to be less than 1/5 of that."
2021-04-20 16:26:31,wallstreetbets,"Yea, that's what I'm thinking too. Sure, it was at 35% when this whole thing first started. But now shorts have increased their position by like 20%, hence the title of this post. Lol."
2021-04-20 16:30:29,wallstreetbets,"Gotcha. Yea, I think even as recently as 3/31 the whole short squeeze potential wasn't there. But the situation has been changing super rapidly!"
2021-04-20 18:20:09,wallstreetbets,"I wish I was paid for DD. 😂 

Nah, I just see a huge squeeze opportunity and see shorts doubling down instead of trying to filter out before the move. I chat all this stuff with friends irl, but figured I'd put everything together in an actual DD post for once.

All it takes to crush what's left of the GME trade is for the company to issue shares, which would actually be really helpful for them as a company, although not so helpful for current investors.

Just above my risk tolerance at this point personally. I invest to make a better life for my wife and kids. But CLOV definitely is in the early stages right now where there is a lot more opportunity than risk on the table. Like GME and AMC used to be."
2021-04-20 19:06:40,wallstreetbets,"Forex trader in 2017 gives up becomes a passive Robinhood trader in 2020, and suddenly picks up a stock with insane insider activity to only then post a first-time DD?

Words of warning, doesn't matter if you are getting paid off or not, don't link your instagram/twitter with your reddit/tradingview"
2021-04-20 19:03:47,wallstreetbets,"Who is out there paying people like me to make false DDs? Why not do it themselves? Lol.

I personally wouldn't make a false DD because I value my rep. I want to actually be correct about what I say and have that contribute to my rep over time, not just spout off useless info that harms my rep in the long term. That's why I use part of my real name in a lot of my social media and everything. Lol."
2021-04-20 18:31:59,wallstreetbets,"I had read the form transcript thing about the new 500 million. Aron billed it as flexibility to grow. And to your statement, not in 2021. I was late to the AMC party though so thank you for the info on the previous dilution. I still don’t know exactly what to look for sometimes"
2021-04-20 16:29:26,wallstreetbets,Yeah they suggest it went from 38M to 42.5M share sold short
2021-04-20 19:11:38,wallstreetbets,I stopped trading forex when I started grad school and then started my startup. Day-trading takes a ton of time to do well. No time for that these days. Hence why I primarily trade/invest over timeframes of weeks and months now.
2021-04-20 19:18:16,wallstreetbets,You do you bro
2021-04-20 18:37:08,wallstreetbets,"Yupp. The dilution is pretty much why the stock dropped from $4.50 in Nov and $2ish in Jan. At that point I found the stock to be oversold and overshorted and ready for the ""reopening trade"", so I went ahead and took positions at the first sign of bullishness (I think my first calls were at $3).

My issue now is that the next bit of dilution doesn't seem to be being priced in at all yet, meaning it will just get priced in later. That means high potential for bags later."
2021-04-20 19:53:26,wallstreetbets,As in like high potential to be left holding the bag? I’ve definitely been one of those a handful of times. More times than not I get out at a minimal profit by getting in at a good time but getting out after the premium time. For some reason the only really good long moves I make are something like getting callaway right of news of top golf merger then dumping after it doubles. But these meme stocks usually just translate into me buying in at a price that is the low then waiting forever and selling when it’s slightly higher
2021-04-20 15:21:51,wallstreetbets,After observing closely I’ve come to the conclusion the charts are moving in a pre determined fashion/pattern the money just gets played in between. TLDR: the markets don’t work how we think ( demand and supply)
2021-04-20 19:32:53,wallstreetbets,And the money is in playing the spreads.
2021-04-20 15:59:30,wallstreetbets,"I'm not sure what ""open interest calls"" are. Does that mean they don't have expiration dates? How does that work?"
2021-04-20 16:52:58,wallstreetbets,It works like a casino...except with worse odds since Casinos have more regulation than wallstreet
2021-04-20 16:47:04,wallstreetbets,"For an option (for example: AAPL $120c 6/18) the open interest is how many contracts there are “in play”. If the open interest is 1,000 , that means that 1,000 contracts have been written between buyers and sellers. Basically if open interest is high then lots of people own those options."
2021-04-20 15:06:25,wallstreetbets,"Bagholders, unite!"

2021-04-20 16:55:06,wallstreetbets,"You're wrong. 

The 7B was just the first few dominos of a chain that's going to keep going. Go back to '08 when the first few hedge funds fell and after you do that go take look at margin debt vs. s&p 500 in 2008 before the crash and now."
2021-04-20 18:13:17,wallstreetbets,"Maybe they have been hit hard and the market overreacted, however this is only true if you believe that it's all done and rainbows are on the horizon. This was 2 very large meltdowns within a year, how many more skeletons are in the closet? No one outside of CS knows how bad things could actually be, their risk management is/was completely fucked."
2021-04-20 15:30:46,wallstreetbets,If I allowed you to gamble with 7x your current roll do you think I would be scared to do it once more when I got burnt on you?
2021-04-20 17:47:37,wallstreetbets,"The latest odd lots podcast with John Hempton was great, he was a big short of CS and made it sound mega bearish even though he claims to have materially exited the position."

2021-04-20 17:35:42,wallstreetbets,Found an interesting youtube live channel on GME. Thought I could share it here.. : https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=xsLrRVXs87s
2021-04-20 16:29:04,wallstreetbets,Look I get there’s a lot of haters on clov because it just showed up on WSB suddenly. So I understand people’s skepticism. But I been here  before the “ squeeze “. Bottom line is the company has the end goal of shaking up the health care system. At least that’s what I believe. At least some company is trying. Even if they are still in it to make some profit.
2021-04-20 15:31:53,wallstreetbets,"Clover, you almost had it"
2021-04-20 15:44:56,wallstreetbets,CLOV should at least be #2 we gotta step it up

CLOV was shorted to fuck along with most SPACs and was the target of a similar style attack as GME was originally. 

I mean you do you, but you're full of shit if you think the company is a decoy. They've gone from 15 to 7, and I think the reason you see the yolo plays are because s3 partners short interest data was fucked and showed 130% short interest due to not know the actual float"

2021-04-20 17:40:06,wallstreetbets,"OP, may I recommend after this amazing insight, you probably look at some Gourd futures and probably shorting of South Africa."
2021-04-20 16:21:14,wallstreetbets,"Wow and just like that WallStreetBets was offically back to business as normal! Well done sir, and all the best in your future endeavours."

2021-04-20 16:21:45,wallstreetbets,"This is what this subreddit is supposed to be. My main criticism is that during the last protests, people weren’t getting vaccinated. Now that pretty much the whole country can get vaccinated, many will go to CVS. Although they won’t pay for the vaccine, this could still lead to increased sales of people buying things while they are there, which could partially cancel out any damage done at other locations."
2021-04-20 15:09:24,wallstreetbets,So if I loot CVS I’m helping you make money?

I'll buy CVS when they go to $0 like you say."
2021-04-20 13:52:05,wallstreetbets,You had me at napkin math
2021-04-20 17:26:36,wallstreetbets,So should we buy CVS now that he is found guilty on all counts?
2021-04-20 13:53:35,wallstreetbets,"As a black man, this makes me sad but as an ape this seems like a reasonable play."
2021-04-20 13:45:33,wallstreetbets,Are you high?
2021-04-20 13:49:53,wallstreetbets,Ok.  I'll buy the dip at zero and wait for it to pull back up

2021-04-20 19:56:01,wallstreetbets,Something to consider is that CVS also had stores destroyed from the riots. Maybe insurance money kicked in after that dip.
2021-04-20 19:58:51,wallstreetbets,Lol cvs still may drop solely due to fundamentals.  Amazon is pushing super hard for prescriptions and cvs really isn’t able to compete
2021-04-20 16:11:53,wallstreetbets,Only one main component missing from your DD. A lot of the riots were politically provoked during an election year. Democrats are in charge and the MM is under their tenure. Not saying it wont happen but most of the media hated Trump and this helped their cause.
2021-04-20 13:50:34,wallstreetbets,So CVS puts?

2021-04-20 19:34:31,wallstreetbets,bro u disgust me
2021-04-20 15:35:39,wallstreetbets,"There’s no way he’s acquitted. 

At the very least he will be guilty on the second degree manslaughter charge. 

Even with a guilty verdict on that charge it won’t be enough for the folks that never planned to “protest peacefully” from the start. Some activists have already said cities will burn. Your theory on CVS has high probability. There’s a number of companies that may be in the same boat. Could be worth a deeper dive. 

Also, there’s no way this jury deliberates for a whole month. They’ve already had the case for two days. My bet is they have a verdict by next Friday. 

We have another highly volatile trial coming up in Atlanta for the Rayshard Brooks case, as well. It will get ugly here, too. Honestly, it’s been ugly here since those infamous protests last summer. 

Hopefully we will have new moon addresses before it goes down. 

Not financial advice and this in no way expresses my opinion on either case.

**Edit: I stand corrected. A verdict has been reached in the George Floyd case and will be announced at 4:30 pm TODAY!🤭"
2021-04-20 17:55:09,wallstreetbets,"Guilty, for now. Probably be reversed on appeal (Jury intimidation - find him guilty or we burn the place down).  
File for future use."

2021-04-20 16:30:39,wallstreetbets,He will get convicted - his guilt was decided WAY before the trial started. I think its BS to be honest.

2021-04-20 15:11:09,wallstreetbets,I would never condone that. Unless....
2021-04-20 17:15:03,wallstreetbets,Think CVS moons tomorrow?
2021-04-20 14:24:28,wallstreetbets,I mean.  The math checks out.

2021-04-20 16:32:10,wallstreetbets,Target too! It's in the damn name.

That was before the first lockdown in the U.S. Relocated early March to stay clear of the riots and away from major transit lines leading from downtown into the burbs. Also sold 100% of my stocks the Friday before the crash, right at the top. Felt like Nostradamus as the year unfolded."
2021-04-20 17:36:29,wallstreetbets,You might be on to something
2021-04-20 19:46:03,wallstreetbets,Lol it doesn't work that way.
2021-04-20 14:05:35,wallstreetbets,Buying calls on a drop lets you see the strategy actually play out a bit before you enter the trade.  So obviously you want the puts.

2021-04-20 16:44:30,wallstreetbets,Exactly. You got it
2021-04-20 17:10:21,wallstreetbets,It’ll be fine. Not like CVS is gonna moon tomorrow bc of this
2021-04-20 18:06:15,wallstreetbets,Imma close out my shorts in the morning. Shouldn’t be down much at all
2021-04-20 15:21:47,wallstreetbets,So what you’re saying is this can’t go tits up?
2021-04-20 15:33:02,wallstreetbets,"The defense tried to say George Floyd was killed by exhaust lol, being outside and not sucking on the exhaust pipe I wouldn't find a flimsier defense in us history. That fucker is getting fucked."

2021-04-20 14:22:28,wallstreetbets,">>correlation doesn’t equal causation

This line destroys 95% of the DD on this sub lol"
2021-04-20 16:33:06,wallstreetbets,No reason to. It’s not like a guilty verdict will cause CVS to skyrocket
2021-04-20 16:15:51,wallstreetbets,This is the first legitimate argument I’ve seen against this play. Good thinking but I’m sticking it out. It’s not like CVS is gonna moon just bc there are no riots
2021-04-20 13:58:29,wallstreetbets,Yea I’m confused what this jackass’s brilliant play of the century actually is??
2021-04-20 19:48:33,wallstreetbets,Never delete this.

2021-04-20 14:50:27,wallstreetbets,I don’t see how that would save CVS
2021-04-20 14:52:57,wallstreetbets,"I looked at that, but GME is in those etfs and I hold too much GME to short an etf with GME in it. And cvs is grouped into healthcare etfs for some reason"

2021-04-20 18:11:07,wallstreetbets,You honestly believe the entire jury took only 10 hours to deliver a guilty verdict on a massive case like this because they were all scared enough?? You’re dumber than OP.
2021-04-20 16:39:15,wallstreetbets,"Got it backwards. CVS killed George Floyd. Derek Chauvin was there to buy lottery tickets, tripped and fell on George's neck. Had a hard time getting back up. I think that's the consensus. Or maybe Derek was trying to kill CVS, because CVS had its knee on George's neck. Shit. Now I am all confused. What was the case about again?"
2021-04-20 17:25:11,wallstreetbets,The short side of the stock is a pathway to many lossporns some consider to be unnatural.
2021-04-20 17:27:17,wallstreetbets,Chauvin will win the appeal.
2021-04-20 17:34:55,wallstreetbets,Think CVS moons tomorrow?
2021-04-20 17:47:53,wallstreetbets,Don’t think CVS crashes now but I’m only fucked if it moons
2021-04-20 17:43:35,wallstreetbets,"I agree. It was a manslaughter, possibly 3rd degree at most. 2nd degree? What the fuck.

But it was never gonna be a fair trial. The judge even said he'd declare a mistrail if the prosecution brought up Co2 test results. 5 minutes later, they brought it up and the judge ignored it.

Then you've got the president coming out and all the other congress fucks passing comments when they shouldnt. The jury weren't sequestraited from the start like the defence stated.

Whether he was wrong or right, Chauvin never stood any chance at a fair trial. But obviously this is what people wanted.

I'm sure there's a lot of pissed people who cant go and rob a free TV but Target can breathe a sigh of relief."
2021-04-20 17:32:14,wallstreetbets,You’re fucking dumb in the wrong way. Chauvin is going to get impaled in the ass with a sword strap on in the shower room for the rest of his life.  And he deserves it.
2021-04-20 18:05:42,wallstreetbets,I don’t give out advice
2021-04-20 16:04:11,wallstreetbets,Ah shit I didn’t know that but I think the thesis still stands
2021-04-20 16:23:13,wallstreetbets,China wasn't on trial.

2021-04-20 16:02:36,wallstreetbets,"I don’t think a guilty verdict necessarily blows this up. It’s not like the price of cvs is being kept down due to uncertainty surrounding the verdict. $76 is already a pretty solid point of resistance on the chart. I’ll be eating my words if it hits 90 tomorrow, but I really doubt it will"
2021-04-20 17:17:00,wallstreetbets,Oh man. Sick burn.

2021-04-20 17:49:33,wallstreetbets,You should be able to exit this pretty quickly with minimal damage.
2021-04-20 19:13:00,wallstreetbets,And I admire you for it
2021-04-20 14:41:34,wallstreetbets,Idk if I'd consider it winning but I sure do like your avatar.
2021-04-20 18:26:29,wallstreetbets,Somebody else's? Even worse
2021-04-20 19:38:33,wallstreetbets,I think you mean moonshine or brake fluid.
2021-04-20 19:08:54,wallstreetbets,You keep nasty chips.
2021-04-20 16:51:38,wallstreetbets,True.
2021-04-20 15:14:51,wallstreetbets,Totally unfair to Europeans - everyone was calling them MOON rabbits until the freight ship got stuck.

2021-04-20 17:11:11,wallstreetbets,It was a cool play but rip the short thesis
2021-04-20 18:34:21,wallstreetbets,"That's just like your opinion, man."

2021-04-20 15:59:22,wallstreetbets,"What? Soy milk? 

The irony of a cheap mong trying to act cool without them having any solid shar s in anything. Why are you on wsb"
2021-04-20 16:09:39,wallstreetbets,"Honestly as funny as it is, its actually solid DD (in WSB Terms ofc) and this could be really a good play! 

But dunno man, playing with pharma is like with fire, they can fuck you pretty bad. Especially with post-covid and all those long term effects, they havent that bad of an outlook.

But the fuck im doing, talking fundamentals, not like that would matter in this market right now..."

Been holding 1,000 shares myself.  I figure worst case I just let it sit and collect dividends."
2021-04-20 14:22:23,wallstreetbets,Love your average cost. Holding 1000@9.05 lol

2021-04-20 15:36:40,wallstreetbets,I still like the stock and believe it's undervalued. Even with my 4/16 options expired
2021-04-20 14:00:17,wallstreetbets,My wife said hi
2021-04-20 16:10:02,wallstreetbets,Great cost basis on the shares.  Might be able to take a profit prior to earnings on those options.  Long 1600 shares here and continuing to add
2021-04-20 16:35:11,wallstreetbets,"I'm holding 102x 5/21 calls with you. Today was brutal but most of my calls already took the blow, so I'm pretty much sideways.

Looks like the shorts came out of the woods... 1,300,000 available shares down to 25,000 EoD. [Source](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/uwmc)

We need an earnings announcement ASAP."
2021-04-20 18:28:21,wallstreetbets,I don’t like the stock and the stock don’t like me. Think that’s called mutual bonds or something
2021-04-20 13:55:08,wallstreetbets,I also like the stock. Those 5/21 options should do well.
2021-04-20 14:03:56,wallstreetbets,"Just submitted a new purchase. This company is the only place I send loans. Closing a refinance today that was clear to close in 3 days. In for CTC on another that has been active less than a week. Market manipulation is keeping this down, but that won't last forever."
2021-04-20 16:11:40,wallstreetbets,"This literally statistically can't go much lower I'm actually in shock how it's been steadily declining, despite everyone knowing their earnings next month are going to blow the previous quarter out of the water. Stock held steady at 10$ for an entire year as soon as it got posted on wallstreet bets back in February we all get f'ed over . Criminally undervalued IMO"
2021-04-20 18:34:47,wallstreetbets,I price I bought in.
2021-04-20 15:33:20,wallstreetbets,It'll be great value at $6 end of the week!

2021-04-20 13:46:32,wallstreetbets,"Founder: Mat Ishbia has taken the company from 15 employees to 8,000. He has proven the ability to grow and navigate a company during hard times. So even if mortgage originations slow due to interest rate risks, UWM could grow market share. 

Market Price: Market is treating this like a value trap, but it is actually growing and will increase market share in mortgage originations over time. The stock price could double if it went from 6x earnings to 12x earnings which is the bottom end of what a financially healthy GROWING company deserves. 

Publicity: The only reason Mat took the company public was for liquidity and money to fuel growth. Independent mortgage brokers are the best way to get a mortgage and UWM needs extra cash to educate consumers.   


So a bet on $UWMC is a bet that the wholesale lender is the best way to get a mortgage (it is), Mat will grow the company more (he has), and interest rates increase won't be dramatic (we'll see).   


I've had my loan serviced via Rocket and tried to refinance with them. I ended up going through and independent broker and saved $4k on closing via UWM.   


UWM will overtake Rocket in 5 years."
2021-04-20 13:56:27,wallstreetbets,"I bought the stock because it's the cheapest dividend stock with an options chain to sell covered calls, It pays for itself in 18 years on dividends alone. All that is aside from a squeeze or pump possibility."
2021-04-20 16:01:27,wallstreetbets,Proud of you.
2021-04-20 14:31:50,wallstreetbets, I would have thought it was a great value @ $9 as well. Glad I only started following it at $8.
2021-04-20 19:20:13,wallstreetbets,"Wait until they release their report, ppl bought in cause they thought it would go to the russell 2000 and when it didn’t, it crashed"
2021-04-20 16:43:06,wallstreetbets,"Be patient fellow ape, people need loans"
2021-04-20 14:57:11,wallstreetbets,Timing is everything
2021-04-20 16:15:12,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I am not sure the stock moves up much til earnings, but maybe!"
2021-04-20 14:41:24,wallstreetbets,Yes.
2021-04-20 14:10:36,wallstreetbets,"Yeah refinancing with an independent mortgage broker and UWM was a breeze.   


Very different than having to block Rocket calls cause they call you 3 to 4x a week when the interest rate drops .005% and the sales people surprisingly think, ""now is a great time to refinance""."
2021-04-20 16:18:56,wallstreetbets,"The stock holding at $10 is natural for a SPAC pre-merger. UWM has only been trading post-merger since January or something.   
I have a hard time believing it can go much lower as well... but it can. Probably need to look at 2019 earnings and do a 10-12x earnings of that to find the floor.   


I would do that now but... I'm lazy."
2021-04-20 19:34:33,wallstreetbets,"SPACs effectively have a $10 floor, as soon as it merged and the floor was gone it started plummeting."
2021-04-20 15:39:59,wallstreetbets,Haha I got $25k more on the way just in case that happens. A 6.6% dividend on a healthy company is impossible to find.
2021-04-20 17:40:36,wallstreetbets,"I’m paying them each month on my mortgage for the last 12 months.  If it dip to $6, I have $15K waiting.  Bring it on!"

2021-04-20 16:00:01,wallstreetbets,I agree with you.  Worried those contracts are too short though.
2021-04-20 13:55:43,wallstreetbets,Thanks. The reasons behind the trade are sometimes more interesting than the trade itself and help to add some dialogue.
2021-04-20 13:59:50,wallstreetbets,Your boyfriends wife needed servicing too. :P
2021-04-20 14:07:10,wallstreetbets,Yeah it is really weird for a financially healthy and growing company to pay a 5.2%+ dividend. The market will fix that soon.
2021-04-20 16:04:15,wallstreetbets,"Yeah it is a May 5th earnings play. I have just been averaging down as it drops.   


If earnings doesn't move the stock at all... it could be trouble."
2021-04-20 14:05:30,wallstreetbets,I agree. Lotta smart people on /wallstreetbets and it is fun to see how they view the market.
2021-04-20 16:08:13,wallstreetbets,They blew the last earnings OUT OF THE WATER and it dropped after a slight AH rise.  That plus IV crush = be careful!
2021-04-20 13:23:02,wallstreetbets,At least someone is making money in this dumpster fire
2021-04-20 13:58:10,wallstreetbets,= 100% $RTRD

2021-04-20 13:23:17,wallstreetbets,Puts and shares? Or what am I looking at?
2021-04-20 14:32:11,wallstreetbets,Just curious why you shorted it
2021-04-20 14:39:43,wallstreetbets,"I think it goes “10% luck, 20% sklz”"
2021-04-20 14:57:56,wallstreetbets,Congratfukulations.  I think it's about time to close that one out and put it in the win column.
2021-04-20 15:13:42,wallstreetbets, At 18$ with 415 shares. Thinking I had bought the dip lol 😂
2021-04-20 16:12:30,wallstreetbets,Yep that pretty much sums up stock market odds.
2021-04-20 18:45:22,wallstreetbets,100% dedicated sex appeal!
2021-04-20 14:05:24,wallstreetbets,Down from here. Will buy some at $9. Perhaps take profit now my dude and get back in later?
2021-04-20 16:51:28,wallstreetbets,This is a big 🧠 move
2021-04-20 18:47:04,wallstreetbets,Why did you short SKLZ?
2021-04-20 14:09:30,wallstreetbets,I'm still working on my 20% concentrated power of will.
2021-04-20 13:26:54,wallstreetbets,$100K short + $55K in Dec 2021 30 Puts

2021-04-20 17:02:21,wallstreetbets,Not closing out short anytime soon
2021-04-20 15:14:24,wallstreetbets,How did you figure to short ? Even fret ARK investment went in on SKLS ?
2021-04-20 15:34:15,wallstreetbets,Team retard
2021-04-20 15:43:30,wallstreetbets,🦍🧠 ok
2021-04-20 12:54:41,wallstreetbets,"Wish is one of the few IPOs that are down from IPO price last year for a reason.

People have a negative opinion of Wish because they associate the company with it's service/experience: low quality, scammy, generally poor experience, greed followed by regret, and often regret they didn't just go with Amazon. 

Thus the stock will always have that negative sentiment weighing it down. It's the same reason why GME is worth so much but WFC and  UAL trade lower than their peers adjusted for sales performance & book value."
2021-04-20 12:56:10,wallstreetbets,"I just created a profile to check out what it looked like. They have nothing but shit, actual shit. Reminds of the outdoor flea markets with knock off $10 gucci sunglasses. With that being said, I’m sure there millions of people who browse through their shitty app all fuckin day"
2021-04-20 12:45:22,wallstreetbets,Maybe I can make some money back my wife spent on junk from there... I'll throw in a small amount.
2021-04-20 13:23:11,wallstreetbets,"Ah...just have to be careful to not buy the wrong, knock-off version: wizh."
2021-04-20 12:38:54,wallstreetbets,"Interestingly it is trying to be AliExpress to people who don't trust Chinese companies.  Can't say their ethos is any better since they came from Facebook but from an investment perspective they're definitely attractive for what they are.  Need to do some more read up on it... Thanks for the post, man."
2021-04-20 13:12:46,wallstreetbets,"site looks like SHIT

pass"
2021-04-20 13:05:13,wallstreetbets,Thanks I just shorted it
2021-04-20 12:48:52,wallstreetbets,"Nice earnings 😃 ... sry but my smooth-🧠 is like: THX, BUT NO THX"
2021-04-20 16:46:15,wallstreetbets,"Lol fuck that. Their business model isn't sustainable at all.

1. Wish is absolute garbage, what they sell is 99% junk.
2. UI is awful in both web and app, good luck finding anything specific. I've browsed them for a couple of years now and there's been no notable improvements. They also do that fucking annoying thing where they will post a cheap selection on the product you're looking for, and when you select what you searched for, the price goes up. Impossible to shop based on price.
3. Anyone who has purchased from Wish knows their products are incredibly low quality. Sure you get it for peanuts, but when you consider most items you buy off there will be a waste. If anything that puts people off from buying knockoffs, I doubt more than 5% of their first time buyers return. 
4. Scam tactics. Most of the products listed are nothing like the photos, and they know it. They know people aren't going to shell out x10 what they spent on it to return them, so it's pretty much a ""order at your own risk"" transaction
5. Customer service is rubbish, I ordered some random shit a couple of months ago for lols and didn't get like 2/6 items. I opened a customer service dispute and never heard back from them. Again, likely just expect people to not give a shit because the money spent isn't worth the effort.

If you want a dubious Chinese company that may actually make you some money, even Luckin Coffee is a better alternative than this dumpster fire."
2021-04-20 18:52:13,wallstreetbets,"I agree with you, and all the people on here that say ""WISH is junk therefore I wouldn't buy shares of it"" are completely missing the point.  If that is your thought process about WISH, then YOU ARE NOT THE TARGET AUDIENCE.  The WISH CEO  agrees - ""Despite our metrics, we were told repeatedly and at every stage by Menlo Park investors that they didn’t know anyone that would shop on Wish.""  There's so much conjecture with no actual data to back it up, and people missing the big picture.

In their S-1 filing, they have a few graphics that describe their users' spending habits over time.  They break out cohorts of users by the year that they started using the platform.  Each year, a given cohort spends more than it does the previous year.  Each year, the newest cohort spends more than the second-newest cohort in their first year.  There is clear compounding growth here.  This is borne out by their 38% revenue YoY growth.

Their newly-launched proprietary logistics-as-a-service platform recently sported 275% YoY revenue growth, up to about 500M, or somewhere around 20% of their yearly revenue.  This is huge.  They should be able to keep scaling this up massively.  It's low-margin, but it looks like it will be a big part of their revenue moving forward.

WISH local is also doing well in international (read: non-USA) markets.  This lets WISH save some money on large numbers of low-value shipments, and increases the propensity of customers in these regions to order off WISH.

I see a ton of comments here to the effect of ""lol WISH,"" which I understand.  There's a reason I wouldn't ever buy anything off WISH.  But that doesn't make it a bad investment.  OP, I'm with you.  It may take a while for things to turn around, but they are forecasting 70% YoY growth for Q2, and that sort of growth speaks for itself."
2021-04-20 13:44:17,wallstreetbets,"Yeah it's so cheap because of disgusting working conditions & wages.

Are you happy investing money in people that are literally abused of working 10 hours a day, 7 days per week, for few hundreds dollars per month in a factory making those cheap crap for greedy people that aren't interested in paying stuff at the right price?

I'm retarded but I have some values & respects for people who don't have the chance to yolo"
2021-04-20 14:58:23,wallstreetbets,I bought a share and they gave me a ration.
2021-04-20 19:14:36,wallstreetbets,It is addictive for sure. I got a few items which are useless or broken now then uninstalled the app.
2021-04-20 14:45:37,wallstreetbets,"I'm still recovering from Coupang losses, so this seems like sound financial advice to me!"
2021-04-20 15:31:47,wallstreetbets,"Exactly this. If I’m not going to buy from them, I’m sure other people share the same opinion. There for people will tend to stay away from the stock"
2021-04-20 14:11:45,wallstreetbets,"I feel like 80% of their customers are people who think ""what's the worst that could happen? It's only like $8"" and then they get the thing and are like ""Ah... I see. That's the worst that could happen."" And never use Wish again. It's like mlm level customer burn haha."
2021-04-20 16:54:47,wallstreetbets,"The worst thing is, the products are much worse than what they actually look. Not great considering it already looks awful."
2021-04-20 12:53:24,wallstreetbets,"why not, lets get that bread"
2021-04-20 12:40:52,wallstreetbets,not buying shit on the stock market everything is fucked.
2021-04-20 13:48:54,wallstreetbets,"The app is where it's at, apparently."
2021-04-20 16:33:52,wallstreetbets,lol to the Earth's core!
2021-04-20 14:36:45,wallstreetbets,"It's a dice roll for sure. Occasionally you get something decent, you do get burned a lot too. Also depends on WHAT you're buying."
2021-04-20 12:41:22,wallstreetbets,What about... The options market? :-D
2021-04-20 12:54:01,wallstreetbets,Fucking feel you man
2021-04-20 12:53:50,wallstreetbets,everything is sideways and will just lose money
2021-04-20 13:03:17,wallstreetbets,No.. iron condor? :-(
2021-04-20 13:04:09,wallstreetbets,surely there is a way to play this garbage but i'm not smart enough. probably will just lose money.
2021-04-20 13:12:16,wallstreetbets,Uvxy is a trash derivative. Spy puts debit spreads are much easier to use and more cost effective.

2021-04-20 13:18:13,wallstreetbets,If you just bought this you may be fukt. Last week was the time.
2021-04-20 14:33:12,wallstreetbets,What's the obsession with UVXY
2021-04-20 14:57:26,wallstreetbets,Arent u gonna get fucked hard when this reverse splits?
2021-04-20 15:25:59,wallstreetbets,"Uvxy is not that good, it doesn't work like its supposed to"
2021-04-20 18:06:50,wallstreetbets,I've been playing it the last 2 months and I've been crushed. U can't hold it for more than 1 day. Good luck with the IV crush even though I approve this play.
2021-04-20 19:11:26,wallstreetbets,"This ended very poorly for me, so I’m sure you’ll make a killing"
2021-04-20 19:14:03,wallstreetbets,Volatility gang rise up!
2021-04-20 13:17:56,wallstreetbets,"Trash? lately because we’re in a bull run—that’s why it’s a YOLO. I’m betting on the correction in the next 2 months. UVXY is 1.5x leveraged exposure to a portfolio of 1-2 month bearish future positions, even if the S&P loses 10% id at least double up."
2021-04-20 13:37:57,wallstreetbets,you just reminded me of Plug power...PTSD
2021-04-20 13:15:35,wallstreetbets,What kind of phone?
2021-04-20 14:34:55,wallstreetbets,Uhh. You serious?
2021-04-20 13:20:34,wallstreetbets,🧢 - just wait
2021-04-20 15:00:10,wallstreetbets,Yea it’s gonna return back to normal levels when the bull market resumes but this is a short term bet so I shouldn’t be affected if I cash out before that
2021-04-20 18:55:45,wallstreetbets,I was gonna play it back at 10 but I’m glad I didn’t I think it’s at its low now tho
2021-04-20 13:30:10,wallstreetbets,"Lol 😆 you should have bought $VIXM that fund is for day trading, the decay alone will burn your account even if the spy drops 10% over a few weeks. Why even make such a lazy and autistic trade? Uvxy requires a major 1 day move, not a slow 1 month one. (Even then it sucks)"
2021-04-20 13:54:56,wallstreetbets,Huawei. Try different programs on play store and phone blacks them all out!
2021-04-20 19:39:05,wallstreetbets,"The low/resistance is 4,5$. I think market will go back near 415 before going down again. I think you should buy end of the next week. However, this is not a financial update! Keep me updated!"
2021-04-20 13:35:48,wallstreetbets,"That fund is for whatever the fuck I want it to be. Yes, people use it for daytrading, but who the fucks timing is that good? If it swings in volatility and jumps 100% I’ll just execute and flip/ yea the decays ass but.. Yeolo"
2021-04-20 13:38:37,wallstreetbets,"Like I said, even at the best/worst timing, SPY debit spreads are cheaper and better, but you do you."
2021-04-20 14:51:21,wallstreetbets,He's trying to keep you from losing even more money don't be an ass about it![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|shrug)
2021-04-20 13:40:05,wallstreetbets,"Alright I see what you mean but my bet is on the correction before June. Say that happens, even tho the put spreads are safer, would this position not maximize profits?"
2021-04-20 13:49:21,wallstreetbets,"You are in a correction now, if you wanted to bet on a correction you should have done it last week. I started selling the puts I bought on Thursday today. You realize the market was oversold here, not structurally ready for imminent failure."
2021-04-20 14:05:06,wallstreetbets,"Ah okay, so that’s where we differ. I don’t think this was the correction. I don’t think we’re structurally ready for failure, but the thing is even if we were we wouldn’t know. I have a very pessimistic view on the integrity of market makers and the SEC. I think the feds been artificially keeping inflation rates low and I’m expecting a pop soon. Yea it’s ballsy but my gut feelings like this have paid off before."
2021-04-20 14:50:06,wallstreetbets,Exactly and yet vix didn't really bounce so idk what this dude is betting on.
2021-04-20 15:01:17,wallstreetbets,"👌 good luck, my gut feeling is we see more ATHs for Q2 this year because the YoY comps are easy and the dems own the house and senate for easy infrastructure packages.

The trouble will start in Q3 when the RoC slows and the YoY comps are much tougher. Then you will see some significant volatility, but by then owning this derivative will have lost you more than you make."
2021-04-20 15:05:27,wallstreetbets,Yea I definitely don’t plan on holding that long but if I decide to pull out soon I don’t see my losses being anymore than 15% which is within my risk tolerance. Thanks for your feedback though I’ll look into that.
2021-04-20 12:35:01,wallstreetbets,Love me my MRNA from $30.
2021-04-20 13:32:30,wallstreetbets,"Loving MRNA. Their vaccine is well positioned for the eventual rollout to poorer countries and more rural locations.

Plus look at the stuff in the pipeline. I’m anticipating a cancer cure."
2021-04-20 12:52:53,wallstreetbets,Priced in
2021-04-20 12:24:41,wallstreetbets,stonks only go one direction over any meaningful time interval
2021-04-20 19:57:15,wallstreetbets,"I fucking love MRNA. They stopped what they were doing and gave us a 94.5% effective vaccine in 9 goddamn months! Now that they have mastered the delivery of mRNA with their fantastic little liquid nanoparticles (LNPs) they are working on covid/flu combination vaccines as well. Them and bioNtech are one of the few green positions I have.

2021-04-20 12:23:22,wallstreetbets,Quite possibly. Some of my Amc tendies might go there
2021-04-20 12:49:24,wallstreetbets,OVER 5000!!!!!!!!
2021-04-20 15:15:06,wallstreetbets,"I think their valuation has little to do with current vaccine contracts, that is priced in.  What matters is what their sales will be next year and thereafter.  Will less developed nations opt for Moderna?  Will there be a booster shot?  How quickly can they get a new vaccine to market?"
2021-04-20 18:17:55,wallstreetbets,I’m betting they are closer to $2.20 a share by then
2021-04-20 15:32:53,wallstreetbets,I’m betting on Bayer. They produce the Curevac vaccine and they got hit hard by the Glyphosate litigation so they are at a attractive price point with a great upside potential. I see a opportunity
2021-04-20 14:47:40,wallstreetbets,"You willing to put your money where your mouth is, pal?"
2021-04-20 13:38:24,wallstreetbets,Wow nice!
2021-04-20 13:46:11,wallstreetbets,"I think there will be heavy pushback on the cancer trials as well as the supposed HIV research. In any case, we are witnessing the forefront of mRNA medicines."
2021-04-20 19:01:44,wallstreetbets,Way too much money and jobs in people having cancer. Don’t expect a cure
2021-04-20 12:36:19,wallstreetbets,"""down"" - my portfolio :("
2021-04-20 12:58:13,wallstreetbets,Down?
2021-04-20 15:19:28,wallstreetbets,"It was a gamble .. Small position (1.5K) .. sold half when it doubled and sitting on about 8K of paper gains now. Just gonna hold for 10 years because my DCA is covered. Game changing technology (now proven) and I liked the CEO's ""we're not a charity"" mindset. Bullish."
2021-04-20 13:47:25,wallstreetbets,Cancer vaccine looks promising - 20% of study participants with neck cancer saw tumours go away. Agreed that the hiv trials will be challenging.
2021-04-20 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,$150k YOLO on $UWMC 
2021-04-20 12:07:55,wallstreetbets,Holy shit your dividend check alone covers my mortgage for 2 months. Wish I had the cash to do this
2021-04-20 15:14:16,wallstreetbets,"I don't get the bad comments, most of us watching UWMC agreed that 7.50 is a great dip to buy, I was waiting a bit because it crashed through that floor so hard tinder was flying around. I'm looking carefully if the paperthin floors below are holding. 

There has not been any news around this ticker suggesting a reason for this drop, unless I'm missing some macroeconomic thing (which I doubt, since my other financial is been giving small green all month) this doesn't smell nice, this is a nice dip buy, just have to wait if this guy is right on the timing of the dip."
2021-04-20 11:52:07,wallstreetbets,This is how you turn 150k into 80k
2021-04-20 12:49:12,wallstreetbets,You got in at a great price this will pay off eventually. Between the awesome dividend and selling covered calls this position is a cash cow big enough to live off of all by itself.
2021-04-20 14:58:43,wallstreetbets,Finally some UWMC!
2021-04-20 12:21:53,wallstreetbets,"Just when I thought the stock hit rock bottom..averaged down below $8, yet I’m further away from the stock price than I was yesterday."
2021-04-20 11:41:35,wallstreetbets,May i ask why?
2021-04-20 12:07:33,wallstreetbets,My 69 may 21 10c approve this message

Bullish"
2021-04-20 11:50:25,wallstreetbets,A YOLO or an investment?
2021-04-20 11:48:53,wallstreetbets,I love the smell of retard in the morning.
2021-04-20 12:13:40,wallstreetbets,Your arms are going to be so jacked holding those bags for a year or so
2021-04-20 17:30:24,wallstreetbets,I put in $3k today on UWMC
2021-04-20 11:56:17,wallstreetbets,What a great cost basis.  I'm 1600 shares deep at like $9.40 but we'll be $15-$20 by the end of the year.
2021-04-20 12:04:14,wallstreetbets,Damn cuh
2021-04-20 15:41:27,wallstreetbets,Nice entry point. Could be a long term play but with that kind of dividend I'm ok with it.
2021-04-20 18:44:20,wallstreetbets,Great entry point. UWMC is such an undervalued gem.
2021-04-20 11:45:02,wallstreetbets,How are these ppl real
2021-04-20 13:23:14,wallstreetbets,"I like it because it is a cheap stock with both dividends and an options chain to sell covered calls, way undervalues imo, It's in the same position as MAC was last year. It will eventually pay for itself and has a ROI with dividends. So it will pay for itself in 18 years with dividends alone (not counting covered calls). If you have a long term outlook, I think it's a good stock. Every quarter your cost basis goes down by 10 cents a share, so it shouldn't take too long to be profitable, even if the share price stagnates."
2021-04-20 17:27:45,wallstreetbets,"Considering you bought at nearly the all time low running up to May 5th earnings which are expected to be impressive, I'm jealous of your timing. The stock is likely to go up without any significant bad news and is a great value play."
2021-04-20 13:35:40,wallstreetbets,This is retarded af TBH
2021-04-20 12:12:23,wallstreetbets,I rather YOLO that 150k on GME.
2021-04-20 11:42:29,wallstreetbets,Why?
2021-04-20 15:51:11,wallstreetbets,Good luck to us both!
2021-04-20 16:20:14,wallstreetbets,And you get fucking $686.23 a month for holding it. What a great stock.
2021-04-20 17:03:26,wallstreetbets,You could buy top shelf gold leaf drenched tendies with those cc premiums.

2021-04-20 14:51:02,wallstreetbets,You could of put in chunks of 50k to triple down on the dip ..
2021-04-20 18:49:00,wallstreetbets,"I sincerely hope this works out for OP. Looking at UWMC’s 10k and a handful of others in financial services, I’m concerned that they posted a -5M net income number in 2020 when most competitors were in the hundreds of millions range."
2021-04-20 19:10:10,wallstreetbets,"Honestly I lost a little chunk of money on USMC and I’m not feeling that stock. 

But with that said I wish you luck and I hope you make a wicked profit!"
2021-04-20 15:03:42,wallstreetbets,Big balls - how much of this 150k is your total cash holdings?

2021-04-20 17:31:47,wallstreetbets,"Can you explain the dividend to me? At 1.34 div/yield what would you get off of those 20,586 shares"
2021-04-20 13:20:28,wallstreetbets,He can collect on fat dividend payments and sell covered calls on all of his shares at his desired exit point and float this position all the way until the deep value play turns him a profit.
2021-04-20 14:22:34,wallstreetbets,"Pretty sure this is how you double up. Buy low, sell high. This is exactly when you would buy a stock... At the bottom. They are hugely profitable. Just a matter of time before it pops."

2021-04-20 11:46:53,wallstreetbets,"There are plenty of DDs on why UWMC is attractive, it's printing money right now (company not stock).  But it's being shorted heavily, and there isn't near enough momentum to beat those shorts so it's going downer downer downer."
2021-04-20 13:54:49,wallstreetbets,Because it’s way down. You’re suppose to buy when the stock has been beaten down not when the stock is at ATH

Maybe GME has a really strong chance of going down, but he can cover with some puts, and ride this strat into May and make a lot more than UWMC."

2021-04-20 19:36:08,wallstreetbets,"I think it's the longtime outlook with potential hyperinflation and eventual mortgage rate rise. They have a lot of business now, but the worry is that it'll slow down once rates rise again and inflation won't make it bettrr. The upside is that they have arguably the best fintech for mortgages and they're getting more of the market share. If they know how to use the money they're getting now wisely, it'll relieve a lot of investors' fears."
2021-04-20 14:42:58,wallstreetbets,Nope. Wanna hang?
2021-04-20 19:21:46,wallstreetbets,Well it’s a long term play. Take the quarterly gains and dividends until the underlying reaches your expected price/exit based on your thesis.
2021-04-20 14:36:11,wallstreetbets,i mean I'm selling CC's on UMWC that are like 6 weeks out making about 0.7%/week in premiums. underlying is bleeding tho but I don't mind holding it I think my entry point is pretty decent at like 7.66 avg cost
2021-04-20 13:40:25,wallstreetbets,And also take a way higher risk lol
2021-04-20 16:29:46,wallstreetbets,"> If he did that in GME buying at right nows prices (156 at 160 strike for THIS FRIDAY), he would make 6300 in premiums.

And if the price dropped like it did today, he would have lost $2586 in underlying value today alone. Odds are by end of day Thursday he would have ended up on the wrong end of that transaction."
2021-04-20 13:36:49,wallstreetbets,U can sell covered calls for leaps at a 13 dollar strike November for .45 a contract. On his shares that’s 10 grand premium on an exit point that’s 55% higher on his cost basis. That’s not including a dividend which last quarter was .1 per share which is another 2k per quarter. That’s if there’s no special dividend which is likely for this next earnings report.
2021-04-20 17:18:52,wallstreetbets,And that is why it is important to hedge.
2021-04-20 15:09:31,wallstreetbets,You only lose when you sell. Some things require patience and knowledge to get ahead. This is one of those trades.
2021-04-20 13:01:00,wallstreetbets,Don't beleive this guy. UWMC gushes cash. Buying a mortgage through a broker saves you thousands initially and gets you a 0.15% lower interest rate on your mortgage on average. It saves the consumer money. Its also way faster about 45 days faster on average which is also more convenient for consumer. Because of this it is no suprise that each year wholesale mortgages gains more of the overall total residential mortgage market share. UWMC is the largest wholesale mortgage player they have around 35% of the entire wholesale mortgage market. They are gaining more marketshare of the wholesale mortgage market each year and have been for over 5 years.    There are tailwinds for wholesale mortgage lenders and headwinds for resedential mortgage lenders such as RKT.
2021-04-20 13:43:15,wallstreetbets,"Negative cash flow? Lmao you’ve done zero research yet make absurd claims with such confidence 

A true ape"
2021-04-20 14:19:36,wallstreetbets,They have massive cash flow. They have a large money horde right now. They are the largest wholesale lender by a wide margin. Basic math shows they are undervalued.
2021-04-20 19:02:00,wallstreetbets,"The market cap is actually 11.6 billion at today's price. That market cap is of the underlying (i.e. premerger) company, and the parent UWMC company, not just the UWMC company. 

The 425m you refer to is the cash assets that are wholly owned by UWMC. These are not at all owned by the underlying company. 

So your statement is inaccurate and very misleading.

In reality, the UWMC parent company has 425m in cash assets. UWMC owns about 3.5% of the underlying company, so owns 3.5% of its assets. You make absolutely no mention of the assets owned by the underlying company. These assets exist and have value, but you've not mentioned them.

The market cap of only the parent UWMC company is not widely reported anywhere, because no one usually cares about just it to the exclusion of its underlying company. But if they did, they'd be reporting it as close to a market cap of 406m.

It is undervalued if you value a share by a companies book value. It's undervalued mainly because of future fear of rate rises, but also because some people miscalculate book value... 😉😂"
2021-04-20 16:47:35,wallstreetbets,"What does assets have to do with a mortgage company? Dude it’s a financial company, not a real estate company."
2021-04-20 14:27:39,wallstreetbets,Shhhhh no one wants to hear the price is purely momentum and nothing to do with value

Most of the ones have similar info since then, but some things to note: Russell index inclusion did not happen, though potentially could be included in their next list.  The stock has been barraged lately, most likely shorters.  On top of that, rising interest rates has put off investors as well.  Without a catalyst, there just hasn't been enough interest/volume to get it consistently moving upwards again.  The next hope is May earnings, which all point to being stellar, but we'll see if it's enough to change trajectory."

2021-04-20 17:15:43,wallstreetbets,"Let's say he bought in at 12:20, when the price was $7.29.

For $150k you can buy ~957 shares of GME. If it drops another $7 tomorrow (which is far from unreasonable based on the last 2 days), that wipes out $6699 in value in a DAY. If he sold 9 $160 4/23 CC's at $9 a piece (closed the day at 8.48 down 36% on the day) that's only $8100 in profit against $6699 in losses. So if it drops another $7 tomorrow, he's looking at only $1401 in wiggle room against it dropping further. I don't like those odds.

Meanwhile, buying that much in UWMC right near its all time low with earnings coming up in a few weeks and a strong dividend ($2058.6 on the number of shares) AND plenty of room to grow? It's a dramatically better investment, both in terms of lower risk, a dividend, and a much closer floor (GME would have to go up $22 for a $1 increase in UWMC price to give a better gain). All together it just makes too much more sense."

2021-04-20 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$GOEV - the next squeeze? TLDR: $GOEV has been shorted heavily over the past 2 weeks. There are currently 0 shares left to borrow and borrow rates were in excess of 40% yesterday. GOEV has a history of failure to deliver; combine this with high call option volume, and you have a lot of tinder. If the share price reverses (and depending on how quickly) this could be a prime squeeze candidate.

Canoo ($GOEV) has been beaten into oblivion over the past 2 weeks, and now trades at a steep discount to the SPAC vehicle that acquired it. This came after a disappointing earnings call and a major shakeup in the business model as well as leadership. Obviously there is a lot of FUD in the stock, and shorts have taken advantage of this sentiment to drive down the price. 


**No Shares Available to Borrow:** In fact, the amount of shorting over the past 2 weeks has now resulted in 0 shares available to borrow (according to fintel).

https://imgur.com/a/YLQSnS9

**High Recent Short Volume:** As you can see there have been ~10M shares sold short over the past 2 weeks, and GOEV already had a 15% short interest before this. Add this all up you could have anywhere from 50-60% of the float currently sold short.


**Failure to deliver:** GOEV also has a history of high failure to deliver whenever the price spikes. There were over 1.1M shares that failed to be delivered on 03/22. This indicates that shorts are overextending themselves.


**Gamma Squeeze Potential:** There is also extremely high call volume for the $10 and $15 strike, so if it starts to approach those price levels there will be increased buying pressure due to gamma hedging. 

Main takeaway: If the stock starts to reverse course before the shorts cover this could jump very fast to $10-15 again. Because of this, I will be opening a small long position.

I think you’re getting your wires crossed because Canoo haven’t said they have 45,000 preorders.

Established OEMs have worked with contract manufacturers (like Magna) since forever. Setting up a factory yourself is expensive as hell and has a learning curve so there’s definitely use cases and volumes that make sense for a contract manufacturer.

And the Canoo EVs don’t only exist on computers, they’ve undergone multiple development phases, most recently winter testing.

2021-04-20 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Lumber Industry DD First DD so give me your patience.

Housing is fucking nuts in the past year as people move out of the cities and into suburbs across America and the world. This has led to great plays like UWMC or RKT, which have had their time and I would still argue are undervalued but that's not the point right now. 

As the housing demand went so high, each industry involved in housing shot up; mortgages are the most recent example, with RKT doubling in a week and UWMC seeing a 40% week earlier this march. Homebuilders like [TOL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TOL/) and [LEN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LEN/) have also seen enormous runups. These all make sense because houses are expensive and the volume moving on the market is obscene. The next logical step is not far from what the vitards pulled off with the steel plays like $MT: directing your attention at the most base material for all this shit.

**Stocks in question**

The stocks in mind are UFP Industries ($UFPI), a Michigan based wood and wood alternative producer, and Louisiana Pacific (LPX), a Tennessee based lumber product producer. I picked these two because they've both got solid results over the past year, are substantial companies, and have earnings coming as soon as tomorrow after close for UFPI. Their products go into American houses at every step, from the main beams to the siding, [and lumber has only gotten more expensive in the past year.](https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/lumber)

Lumber futures also signal that this will continue for a while: 

>Even the May 2022 contract, a full year out the curve from the current spot month, is priced at “only” a 25 percent discount. None of this is good news for builders or other professional buyers of nearly all grades of lumber, because they’ve got to have lumber to build, and the building season is hitting full stride as the calendar advances. These folks are paying up because they have no alternative, and there is no indication this trend will end anytime soon. The pros who use lumber will continue to buy what they need, if they can get it, even at elevated price levels.

^https://www.forbes.com/sites/salgilbertie/2021/04/17/lumber-prices-rocket-higher-as-demand-overwhelms-supply/?sh=2a2fe3cf21f9

The futures price of lumber regardless, there is a lumber shortage and those who stand to gain the most are those who produce it. Homebuilders too may suffer

> American Homes 4 Rent, which built more than 1,600 rentals last year and plans to construct another 2,000 houses this year, said its lumber bill is between $20,000 and $25,000 per house, up from about $10,000.

^https://www.wsj.com/articles/commodities-boom-hits-home-11615973404

Another nice thing is that LPX and UFPI have a p/e ratio of ~15 and ~20 respectively, so you're not buying into some overpriced trash shit even in this market of nutty valuations.

**Short Interest**

Don't ask me about the fucking short interest you fucking ape

**Positions to capitalize**

UFPI posts its Q1 2021 earnings tomorrow. Whereas lumber futures traded from 550-660 for most of Q4 '20, they rocketed up at the end of december and have traded between 668 at a low to nearly 1000 by the end of the quarter. For this reason, I believe that a strong earnings beat is very likely for UFPI, and calls would be great but the fact that they are only available for May 21 kind of is a a ball buster. I'm buying calls only but that's because I am poor

For LPX, they have earnings in May, but its not unreasonable to treat them the same. It is best to save the trouble of theta decay and wait to buy calls, but if UFPI smashes earnings then LPX may go up in expectations of a similar earnings beat as they have significant crossover in their products. 

**personal positions**

1 UFPI share, 1 UFPI 5/21 $80C, 1 LPX 5/21 $70C

TLDR: I am bullish on wood, and my wood is bullish as well"
2021-04-20 12:36:44,wallstreetbets,"I went with DFV’s pick, RFP. But UFPI, LPX, WFG, all are going to have an incredible year this year because the futures market is starting to indicate 1400$ lumber this summer and 1000$ lumber for the rest of the year, possibly i to 2022 as it seems the housing demand is more than willing to tolerate 1000$ lumber. Anyone that knows how to do the math can see how insanely undervalued these companies STILL are even after their rally the last year.

2021-04-20 11:27:37,wallstreetbets,lumber would have been a genius move a year ago. It has already more than tripled in the last year. Never to touch overinflated commodities is what I have learnt from my trading experience.

2021-04-20 11:57:47,wallstreetbets,Canadian lumber stocks such as CFP are barely at the 2018 high and lumber prices I think have doubled.  This run in lumber stocks still has a long way to go 🚀🚀 200 shares CFP @28 not financial advice

Lumber mils are trying to catch up on supply so they jacked their prices up ( I work in construction so we've experienced this first hand when prices shot up a few months ago).  I don't know how this will effect the stock but I would imagine lumber suppliers are going to show massive gains after a 20% plus increase in prices."

Hello Chris,

  What’s the current price for ½” cdx plywood?"
2021-04-20 18:09:29,wallstreetbets,Learn about commodities and futures. There is no shortage. Price is up because they can due to demand. There is NO ACTUAL shortage.
2021-04-20 18:27:10,wallstreetbets,"Yep, in HD buying plywood/osb weekly.  Have to call the boss every time to authorize the additional cost."
2021-04-20 14:58:00,wallstreetbets,You are correct. That fool knows not what he speaks.
2021-04-20 15:14:23,wallstreetbets," Well, I thought supply was low. But TYR312s comment made me dig a little deeper and the e-mails I received about supply being low and prices increasing made me think supply is low. Supply is not low. Confirmed with a phone cal. TYR is right. Prices are sky rocketing and until people stop buying, they'll keep increasing until people stop buying."
2021-04-20 18:06:04,wallstreetbets,Supply isn’t low 🤡. Prices are up.
2021-04-20 15:26:57,wallstreetbets,If you can buy is the issue. We can’t get hardly any financed offers accepted here. Cash is buying up everything. I’m not sure what the best move is. One hand you can be upside in equity if you buy top of the market and it crashes on the other if you don’t get in now you may be renting a lot longer than ideal.  It’s really sad for those wanting to owner occupy for sure.
2021-04-20 13:38:51,wallstreetbets,The construction materials we use also went up 10-20% and they are limiting the color options so they can catch back up with demand on the supplies that are short. The supply is extremely low and they are running out of supplies because construction stopped for a few weeks while production was closed longer! I deal with this on a daily basis and they are expecting at least one more increase this year.
2021-04-20 19:06:00,wallstreetbets,Exactly I know a driver who picks up the wood. He’s witnessed it stocked up. They are holding back.
2021-04-20 18:33:23,wallstreetbets,"""hey boss, the price went up again!""

2021-04-20 18:08:36,wallstreetbets,"People are 🤡 thinking that pricing doesn’t play into “supply” narrative.

Same with lumber. They have it. Just don’t want to pay for it at that markup."
2021-04-20 15:22:29,wallstreetbets,Every builder here says they are delayed bc of lumber backlogs. That to me is supply being low 🤷🏻‍♀️

2021-04-20 15:34:10,wallstreetbets,"Our lumber yard here just confirmed that they have a ton of plywood supply but yet their prices are higher then my regular supplier. My usual supplier was really low on plywood awhile back and they were low on other products we use for home construction and those prices have seen a few increases since covid shut production down and they expect at least another price increase this year. We get notifications weekly from suppliers saying pricing is going up. Try getting metal pricing, it's ridiculous as it's changing weekly and by changing, I mean going up.  Another poster brought up trucking and logistics and that is probably the reason for your backlog. In CA there's construction of apartment and smaller housing going up as fast as can be. So it could be supply is routing to higher density areas to accommodate larger cities first."
2021-04-20 18:06:36,wallstreetbets,That’s a pricing issue not a supply issue. 😂😂

2021-04-20 16:21:34,wallstreetbets,Could be. I’m in OK and contractors are only giving bids for seven days bc prices are fluxing so much they can’t keep up. Basics supply and demand rules I would think apply as to why the price hike. Building is thru the roof here with no end in sight so I expect it will continue to go up over the next several months.
2021-04-20 18:47:03,wallstreetbets,"No shit, we realized that the catalytic converter on our work van was worth more than the van itself.  Maybe those cordless grinders *are* worth their salt."
2021-04-20 16:49:18,wallstreetbets,"We did the same. Used to be good for 30 days, now 7. We had a metal job sign a contract and 7 days after we signed the price went up over 15%!  It's ridiculous! Our supply is high and the price is even higher! Don't think it's because of 4/20 either. I think basic has been thrown out the window and every manufacture and supplier is worried about the markets crashing so if they can sell high they'll keep doing it until people had enough and stop buying. Then prices will drop IMO"

2021-04-20 13:44:02,wallstreetbets,"The inflation is already here on many products I am in construction and jobs we bid in February have to be revisited as the price and scarce materials have made it unprofitable.

Most cleaning products aren't necessary when you can use cheap ass bleach for most disinfecting jobs, a little dish soap and water for mopping and wiping things down, vinegar instead of fabric softener.
 
Bleach, vinegar, borax, ammonia, baking soda can do most jobs; just don't mix the bleach with anything but water.

The market is at, passing, or near ATH recently, are public companies truly more valuable today than a year ago? On the average, probably not, these valuations are from the Ts of cash injected into the markets through Covid stimulus, the market is rising to the inverse of the USD composite value, ie the underlying value of companies isn’t changing much, rather the unit we use to quantity that value is falling in value thus we need more of that unit to express the same value, so prices go up"

2021-04-20 14:32:58,wallstreetbets,Inflation is happening constantly. It’s why products get smaller but the price stay the same. Consumers are less likely to react negatively to products being the same price even if they’re getting smaller. It comes to a point tho that companies are forced to higher the price to maintain profits. People like to dumb down stuff but there are so many other factors.

If you use too much then it foams up excessively and you stop brushing after 15 seconds instead of a full 2 minutes.  The net effect is that the additional toothpaste sharply reduces the total brushing effectiveness and also happens to dramatically increase consumption, but the former issue is the bigger concern.

Don't drive a gas car if you're poor and stop shopping at places that will price gauge.

2021-04-20 15:08:26,wallstreetbets,Inflation and stock market are related. The trend follows high inflation for value stocks and low inflation for growth stocks. Pretty much everything involving stocks is just speculation so saying things will go a certain way with high precision and accuracy is impossible but trends like these are worth knowing because we’ll at least be in the ballpark.
2021-04-20 15:49:01,wallstreetbets,Business can only pass on inflation to consumers so much before it does begin to eat profits. Example: If people used to buy Starbucks coffee(milkshakes) three times a week they’ll be purchasing it once a week. They try to pass along inflation by shrinking the package but this only works to a point.

Look at the Dixie (DXY), down 10% over the same time period, while most other currencies are also inflating supply. 
USD value loss and the slingshot primed by foreign money in public markets as a flight to quality during covid (plainly said,  demand is absorbing much of the supply)  puts our market on a cliff when foreign money pulls out of public us markets and back into US private market and their domestic economies

2021-04-20 16:36:56,wallstreetbets,"So I worked in a super market for 5 years. 1 example that I remember seeing was with toothpaste. A manufacturer sent us 2 sets of tubes, 1 was a couple OZ less then the other (I don’t remember exactly how much smaller) and the other was labeled “value size.” 

Now the thing with the value size is that it was the same size as their old tubes and listed for the same exact price those old tubes used to sell for. The smaller tubes they sent us was also listed for the same price. 

Now as you can imagine the “value size” sold first but after a couple weeks the manufacturer stopped sending the “value size” and only sent the smaller size. The value size tubes were jusr leftover supply that the manufacturer had to get rid of as they transitioned to the smaller size. The smaller size was now the new standard size all for the same price. 

After all this I think I had one customer mention they thought it was maybe smaller but vast majority of people didn’t notice a thing.

That's why 2% inflation is the goal of most governments - rich people cannot simply hoard money, they have to invest it. Otherwise it would get eaten up by inflation.

Lmao what? It's quite the opposite.Deflation makes money literally worth more every day, it encourages hoarding money. Inflation encourages investment into the economy, as otherwise your money looses value every second.

Deflation doesn't happen because governments keep printing money to pay off their debts and to stimulate the conomy

It's a huge problem crypto is dealing with right now, as most (if not all) cryptocoins have a finite supply and its rate of creation constantly reduces itself. Since less coins can be mined every day, coins will tend to become more valuabe over time. This makes it so people hold their coins rather than using them. Why buy a pizza with bitcoin when in a few months that same amount of bitcoin will also buy you a soda to go with your pizza? That's even if somehow demand stays 100% constant"

2021-04-20 19:57:11,wallstreetbets,"I've heard this many times. I just can't picture this. People like buying things. They like to consume. They like to travel and go out to eat. If it got cheaper they'd do it more. This is a fundamental rule of economics. If you reduce the price, people buy more.

Retirement savings for Americans is abysmal. You can save $100 dollars a week and be a millionaire in 30 years. How come so few do it? They have no self control. Theres no reason to believe that would change in a deflationary environment."

Maybe it is my Catholic upbringing (didn’t take) that wants me to do the walk of shame (aka penance in Catholicism).  I’m feeling guilt after my posts [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m7ggs3/cramer_on_plug_powers_stock_drop_i_still_longterm/), and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mmuvqh/plug_to_get_a_520_million_loan_guarantee_to_build/).  I bailed big time!  I feel bad if anybody bought $PLUG off my posts – though I understand I’m not the only beat-up bull on this stock.  And I’ll mention I did buy the January 25 ‘22 calls when plug was hovering around $29 – I’ll do another walk of shame in January or before if that doesn’t work out.  But I’ll understand if I’m not on some people’s Christmas Card list!

You might notice from my posts I’m a Cramer minion – have been for many a year.  That may not score me a lot of karma points here, but all I can say is he has worked for me.  I wouldn’t say I’m rich, but feel comfortable in retirement.  He just might have been at least one person responsible for that (sorry if that offends anybody).  With the Cramer video I posted he said he ‘liked the stock long-term’.  In Cramer-speak I knew, I knew I could get killed in the short-term – I got killed.  However he has drilled into me over the years: “**Diversification is the only free lunch in the stock market”**.  That has saved me, I’m not dead meat in retirement – just a bit annoyed.  And I’m more annoyed at plug CEO Andy Marsh.  I wish he would hit the airwaves and reassure us buckaroos out here the accounting error(s) are no big deal – over and over again would be nice.

There!  My Our Lady of Perpetual Guilt post.

2021-04-20 18:23:24,wallstreetbets,"No good news in a long time. Just a bunch of double speak. The news just been filled with bullshit about that bullshit event none cared about. And today this contract got renewed well that's what everyone expect honestly. None of this is news, they might as well stfu about all of it everything would have been the same.

Let us just see the financial result next month then I can decide if I'm still in or selling. That stock based compensation is killing us, the employees are printing but here we are a bunch of cocksuckers waiting for our share of cocks. God damnit, still holding my 2k shares do not worry buddy."
2021-04-20 14:38:37,wallstreetbets,By the time it’s 34. SPY would be 3400000000
2021-04-20 15:42:43,wallstreetbets,no news also red day

2021-04-20 15:43:44,wallstreetbets,"PLTR puts out a demo which is suppose to excite people, but goes verbal diarrhea with technical jargon and arrogance which probably majority of the human population can not understand.  It turns off people, unless they are in that specific field or in the private sector.

PLTR takes a viable amazing service, an AI that can comb or sort data far beyond human capabilities? Then the company turns around and makes it very unrelatable or seem like telemarketing scam with over the top inflated words to confuse majority of people. They really need someone to market their product better."
2021-04-20 15:38:41,wallstreetbets,First ride back to 24 so I can sell some CC.
2021-04-20 14:32:33,wallstreetbets,I’m currently down 69% on my $27 1/23s which is... *not* nice.
2021-04-20 17:45:42,wallstreetbets,Hilarious how a couple months makes u retards think leaps 2 years away on a stock you’re bullish on is not gonna print
2021-04-20 16:33:52,wallstreetbets,I took a huge hit on my 35cs and rolled them into 25c Jan 2022 and I’m still pretty worried. Break even would be a blessing
2021-04-20 13:48:30,wallstreetbets,That is my trading strategy summed up perfectly.
2021-04-20 11:17:19,wallstreetbets,It's ok to admit you suck at stonks
2021-04-20 19:52:58,wallstreetbets,"Nice!  We’re in the ‘holding for a really long time’ club at our prices!  

I did that already by buying in more at 22, and again at 29, but I’m cool with that cuz I bought it as a 7-10 year play.  I’m prolly gonna buy more if it dips to about 15 (I’m really hoping it does), but then that’ll be it for a decade.  Glad to make your acquaintance!"
2021-04-20 16:12:06,wallstreetbets,Wtf.... I just bought $50 1/23s. Jeezus I might just liquidate and hold shares from tomorrow... I believe in the company but wallstreet just doesn't give em a break dude.
2021-04-20 16:35:07,wallstreetbets,"Geezus, to think the stock won't go up $5 in 8 months is so scary."
2021-04-20 11:19:31,wallstreetbets,I suck at Stonks.

2021-04-20 11:11:38,wallstreetbets,This would appear to be the only practical solution to the electrification of the Class 8 truck market. They are the best positioned to take advantage of the market and have a 1st mover advantage. Most importantly.....I like the stock!

edit: its at 8.14 now, you're a certified bag holder."

2021-04-20 13:56:09,wallstreetbets,I'm at $25 lol
2021-04-20 13:03:46,wallstreetbets,I too FOMO'd into BB. Was selling CSPs and I have 600 shares at a cost basis in the upper 12s. Selling $15 CC to bring that down one penny at a time
2021-04-20 18:52:26,wallstreetbets,fucking stock fucked me and my savings up lmao
2021-04-20 16:08:10,wallstreetbets,I miss the days when we just posted diamond hand and rocket ship emojis and somehow all our bullshit holdings still went up.
2021-04-20 13:44:18,wallstreetbets,If you hold this long-term I think you may be surprised

2021-04-20 10:51:21,wallstreetbets,It dropped into the 2s during the early days of the pandemic
2021-04-20 11:38:52,wallstreetbets,I'm looking at its history for guidance here. Definitely thinking it will hit $5 or $6
2021-04-20 11:18:06,wallstreetbets,#that is what I thought at $9.  I'm waiting for $5 to $6 to average down.  This is not investment advice.
2021-04-20 14:08:10,wallstreetbets,Yeah this is a great price for BB. I’m expecting it to at least double EOY
2021-04-20 13:50:13,wallstreetbets,Awesome 1st time being certified for something Achievement unlocked
2021-04-20 13:23:02,wallstreetbets,I hold bb in two accounts both are TD mine weren't flagged.  When your account got flagged what happened?
2021-04-20 16:47:31,wallstreetbets,I bought up in that region as well lmfao. Holding cuz why tf not. Can’t lose money if you never sell.
2021-04-20 19:17:36,wallstreetbets,Only 6 years to breakeven
2021-04-20 13:49:31,wallstreetbets,Surprised as in $69420 or $0.69?
2021-04-20 13:56:55,wallstreetbets,Oh mama how I wish this is true when GME rocket from $40 back to $300.
2021-04-20 10:32:17,wallstreetbets,Not solid enough for wall street though

2021-04-20 14:44:18,wallstreetbets,Neither are good options.
2021-04-20 10:56:42,wallstreetbets,I bought yesterday and can confirm it does go lower. 🤡

2021-04-20 14:33:34,wallstreetbets,Wall Street prefers company’s that lose money. See TSLA
2021-04-20 10:52:00,wallstreetbets,"Well, in April BB had a few big deals with the Canadian govt, and earlier BB and Volvo signed another big deal. So I’m also quite positive about BB’s future: smth big is coming."

2021-04-20 14:55:15,wallstreetbets,I kind of wish it was. I was really hoping for a move away from Smartphones and the next best option was/is the Blackberry devices. I guess the best bet is the inclusion of their tech in other larger tech right?
2021-04-20 16:36:10,wallstreetbets,I’m cackling. Thanks retards.
2021-04-20 18:42:02,wallstreetbets,I also prefer to lose money
2021-04-20 14:26:23,wallstreetbets,Didn't they also have a partnership with Amazona few months ago too
2021-04-20 14:11:39,wallstreetbets,What makes them big deals? They’re just normal partnerships that BlackBerry constantly has to make as they’re selling software.
2021-04-20 14:25:07,wallstreetbets,"That’s essentially what you’re betting on because today, they aren’t a profitable company and wallstreet seems to hate that."
2021-04-20 15:55:31,wallstreetbets,The Canadian government deal wasn't anything new. It was a new contract that consolidated and replaced the expiring ones they already had at the federal level. It's small potatoes that they already had in their failing revenue stream. There is nothing big.
2021-04-20 14:57:33,wallstreetbets,"Well, BB stepped back from phones a while ago. They’ve been concentrating on developing softwares, and cybersecurity issues for some time now."
2021-04-20 15:01:48,wallstreetbets,"Take a gander if you are interested in what $BB is about:

https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l4ehan/blackberry_dd/"
2021-04-20 14:27:18,wallstreetbets,"Volvo is getting into electric car manufacturing since 2019, and they want to be just an electric cars company by 2030. I think they have a big potential, seeing how competitive they are. Anything with alternative energy seems to be popping now and within the next decade, in my humble opinion. 
In addition, a week ago, IBM and BB established a new partnership. In both cases IBM/Canadian govt address cybersecurity and an event management software issues. I believe that those projects have a potential to bring more interest towards BB.

Edit: grammar."
2021-04-20 14:29:07,wallstreetbets,"Well, didn’t they want to get rid of GameStop the other day? And then it went up to the moon."
2021-04-20 15:56:28,wallstreetbets,I guess the fact that the govt wants to continue working with BB is a good sign?
2021-04-20 15:00:55,wallstreetbets,ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh yeah see..im not that smart with BB. love ya apebruh!
2021-04-20 15:08:15,wallstreetbets,Gamestop was a notoriously shorted company which sparked the movement we saw happen. That isn’t going to happen to BB again anytime soon.
2021-04-20 16:03:19,wallstreetbets,"It's just them supporting and propping up a Canadian company and not wanting to overhaul their existing partnership as it's easier to just continue working the way they already were. There is nothing meaningful in that contract that will bring any significant new revenue to BB.

BB essentially works as a lazy government entity itself on the inside."
2021-04-20 15:09:48,wallstreetbets,My point was: we can’t predict everything:) things happen 🤷🏼‍♀️
2021-04-20 18:22:52,wallstreetbets,"True, but you can use reason and DD to try and edge the odds in your favor. There’s a reason this company is trading in the single digits—it’s not a growth company, it’s a bet on them getting their things together in the future. I like that bet, but to retort with “der a soled compiny” isn’t really true when the main goal of a company is usually bringing in money, and they aren’t doing that right now."

2021-04-20 10:27:20,wallstreetbets,It's getting bogged down by sell orders artificially driving the price down. Recent government contracts don't appear to be priced in.
2021-04-20 18:09:39,wallstreetbets,Because it's a set up I think. Especially with cramer saying it's heavy shorted. Now we got all these posts of mvis. I don't know what to believe but it's fishy for sure.

2021-04-20 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"DD Positions Updates - $ASO $CLOV + why I'm buying $MVIS One thing that can be tough about reading what people post on WSB is not only knowing what the person writing a DD's positions are...but after a day, a week, a month whatever time frame...are they still holding? Have they sold anything?  


I thought it might be helpful for some people to see what I'm doing. I had quite a few comments on both my $ASO and my $CLOV posts. $MVIS is a new one for me today, and I will be buying some calls at market open.   


Two weeks ago I had gotten some ASO stock + calls. I sold my calls for a nice profit before expiration and got into CLOV on Friday. I had 3,000 shares of CLOV + these options below.   


As you can see in my screenshot I've sold off some of my CLOV shares....why? Well, I wanted to free up some cash for $MVIS. One thing I know is that there is a rabid hate for Jim Cramer in this subreddit.....and the $MVIS post u/s2upid with the Cramer video + his youtube video about microvision and then also the post by  u/OG_ClapCheekz69  about his micropenis (which made me LOL) give me some hope $MVIS has some real movement today. There is some good DD within the posts / comments around Microvision.   


Last week $ASO didn't move much...but it is this week. I'm sort of thinking that this week $CLOV might do the same. Often times when ""short squeeze"" gets mentioned with a stock...if it's not up 100%+ in a day or two...it's like people think it's not moving fast enough and get bored. Sure...$CLOV was up 20% friday, and what 8% yesterday? I'm keeping my calls in $CLOV because I think the strikes I bought are solid going into May 21.

&#x200B;

Outside of this, I saw a lot of people complaining about having red accounts yesterday, I was so deep into $CLOV I didn't notice it. As the 10 year yield rises, I'll be buying some calls on the VIX and I might even buy some puts on Apple today...because I think it's risen pretty quick, and the event today...it's ipads, airtags and maybe airpods, it's not that exciting...if the 10 year keeps going $AAPL will probably get some selling by institutions / money managers bc they're risk appetite is non existent. Maybe I'll write another DD on $AAPL before they report earnings / after the event if people are interested. 

&#x200B;

Anyways, updating on my positions bc often times when you write a DD...people get excited / hyped about something and then feel left in the dark not knowing what the person who wrote it is thinking. I'm still bullish on $CLOV $ASO and $MVIS.

2021-04-20 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"ARNC is undervalued Arconic (ARNC) is a ""leading provider of aluminum sheet, plate and extrusions, as well as innovative architectural products"". They provide materials to several sectors, including aerospace, construction and automotive. 

They focus on light metals (which is a desirable characteristic) and will benefit from the stimulus package. Their customers include Boeing, Airbus, Lockheed Martin, Caterpillar, Cummins, Deere, UPS, among other big players. They are projected to have a sales growth this year of 18%, followed by 8% next year on average. For the next 5 years, a growth of 12% average.

Last year, their sales were 5.67B and their market cap is half that, at 2.84B. They have a target price of $36. Last year, they had a loss, but previous years puts their profit margin at \~2.5%. It's small, but profitable. Their debt and liabilities grew considerably last year (debt to assets ratio of 77.3% up from 41.5% in 2019), but if you believe they'll get their shit sorted.

2021-04-20 11:35:49,wallstreetbets,"Couple points to add
1) there has been lots of insider buying of ARNC. 
2) ARNC non compete for packaging materials is  ending next year. This is a nice potential additional revenue stream as beverage companies move away from plastics towards aluminum packaging. 

Short term risk is ARNC provides aluminum for Ford F-150. Any shutdown to production at Ford may hurt ARNC."

2021-04-20 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"#BlackBerry DD 🚀 Time to put some news on the table about one of the most undervalued stocks. It still blows my mind why wall street hates this company.
We know the boomers are retarded, but you literally cannot be that much retarded to undervalue this goddam stock. But enough with chit chat. I am talking about our favourite fruit #BB.
 
Just to put it into perspective… Blackberry has a market capitalisation of 5.12B and a total valuation of around 6B. Total turnover was around 890 million.
Just for comparison cloudflare inc. has a total market cap. Of 23B with a total valuation of 21B while having a total turnover of approx. 430 million. I know this isn’t the best comparison, I just thought it would be interesting.
https://de.wallmine.com/nyse/bb
https://de.wallmine.com/nyse/net
 
This company has transformed itself from a lost hero that made phones to one of the best, if not the best company making security software, yes. Security software, not only cyber security software.
 
Currently BB makes several interesting products.
QNX
QNX Hypervisor
Spark
IVY
AtHoc
And they even make a new phone (manufactured by OnwardMobility)
Information about the phone currently is kinda scarce but still interesting
https://en.letsgodigital.org/smartphones/blackberry-5g-smartphone-2021/
 
As you can see there is plenty of interesting stuff going on…
 
There are plenty of DDs posted on WSB for BlackBerry already and I would only tell the same news again so here is the link for the best one if you want to know more about their products.
Thanks to u/_MoveSwiftly for that great post.
https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l4ehan/blackberry_dd/
 
So what has changed since the DD I posted above?
 
BlackBerry released their earnings, which led to a big dip, that keeps dipping. Reasons for the dip? Honestly I don’t get it. There are literally only positive news for the future. But the boomers don’t care, they are probably still salty their favourite phone company from the good old days is gone and they don’t like the new touch tech.
 
Now the good… And there is plenty good.

Once I did my own research, I realized that BB has been so cheap is cause it’s financials don’t look good. It has huge potential, but if you look at the numbers, without the narrative of the things they’re doing, you can see why it’s not where you’d expect it to be. They can turn things around with what they’re getting into, but they really need to boost their revenues and improve their financial situation."

In this market BB should be 3x higher, at least..

Did you look into the shorting activity on BB?"
2021-04-20 09:04:07,wallstreetbets,"BB and Cloudflare aren't comparable companies. They're both in cybersecurity but entirely different fields. Cloudflare deals with web infrastructure security, internet security, DDoS mitigation. BB is more IoT security, critical event management and UEM. They can't be comparably valued considered the products are vastly different.

A comparable company making security products in the same exact category (IoT, event management, UEM) is Cisco. Cisco trades at 4.67 P/S vs BBs 5.42 P/S. 

BB is also not a high-growth company comparable to Cloudflare which grows roughly 50%+ YoY, if you don't account for acquiring Cylance then BB revenue actually decreased in 2020 (again, like Cisco).

Blackberry QNX neutrino is a great product, and regarded a leader in autonomous vehicle OS, but it's **not** the only OS used by autonomous vehicle companies - most companies use several.

[https://www.intellias.com/everything-you-wanted-to-know-about-types-of-operating-systems-in-autonomous-vehicles/](https://www.intellias.com/everything-you-wanted-to-know-about-types-of-operating-systems-in-autonomous-vehicles/)

Not to mention the size of the market is tiny - globally the demand for AVs was 6700 units in 2020. 

[https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/autonomous-vehicles-market#:\~:text=The%20global%20autonomous%20vehicle%20market,innovation%20in%20the%20automotive%20industry](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/autonomous-vehicles-market#:~:text=The%20global%20autonomous%20vehicle%20market,innovation%20in%20the%20automotive%20industry).

Predicting the size of the AV market is essentially impossible, but it's widely regarded that it won't take off significantly until at least 2030, and that's plenty of time for a other OS's to be developed, or for other companies to battle for market share. Hell VW itself is creating their own OS.

[https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/autonomous-vehicles-market#:\~:text=The%20global%20autonomous%20vehicle%20market,innovation%20in%20the%20automotive%20industry](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/autonomous-vehicles-market#:~:text=The%20global%20autonomous%20vehicle%20market,innovation%20in%20the%20automotive%20industry).

BB has the **potential** to be a strong security player, but until it starts building out products in other areas like cloud security and web security, or showing off incredible growth figures, it's not going to be valued like Cloudflare, it'll sit at more comfortable valuations. Don't forget its still double what the price was at in April 2020."
2021-04-20 11:36:06,wallstreetbets,"""I've seen this before"":

This company had beyond popular phones that lost market share due to trendier products entering the space. This resulted in a pivot to a software company that YOY beats the D&J and NASDAQ. 

What is **Motorola?**

Now is the time to buy BB as a long-term play IMO. Severely under-valued stock, just like Motorola after they no longer had a popular consumer product."

2021-04-20 11:56:13,wallstreetbets,DD means?
2021-04-20 15:34:22,wallstreetbets,"Innovation is always expensive in the short term, so they haven't  made enough money while being perceived as a boomer phone company. Instead they are the only viable security and security ops software provider. At 5B market cap they are extremely cheap. While not completely alike look at other companies that already have an in with the governments and big business like Palantir, Oracle, IBM's market caps. It's not unrealistic for BB, at worst, to double to 10B.

The infrastructure spending will include security and there is no other option that has a long standing reputation or the right products to be a viable option for governments. Same kind of story for commercial companies. The threat of russian and chinese hackers isn't going to go away anytime soon. The thing with being a company like BB is that everybody is going to need them and once they sign the first contract it becomes very hard to switch to something else. This means even if others see the opportunity in the space and come up with competing products and reputation it'll be hard to steal the BlackBerry pie.

I've been loading up the dips, this isn't for retards that like the newest IPO, some EV SPAC, or a random pot stock in Canada. It's for the other kind of retards that can be patient with at least a fraction of the resolve of DFV."
2021-04-20 11:36:17,wallstreetbets,"Why are the people who post blackberry DD always alergic to numbers. I've read dozens of posts on this shit and have never seen anyone post about much QNX, IVY, the security suite, etc are actually worth, or how much revenue they bring in, or how fast they're growing.   
  
How can you retards determine if a company is over or undervalued if you dont have any numbers. $BB could drop to $6 and still be overvalued and you would have not the slightest clue."

2021-04-20 13:21:26,wallstreetbets,"BB is not making money currently, If you enter a position you will need to hold for 3+ years to watch the company turn it around.

The company also have left many investors with a bad taste in their mouth since the early 2000s so many People avoid it"
2021-04-20 15:03:11,wallstreetbets,"People keep mentioning the Canadian government contract as some kind of boon when it's not. It's nothing new. BB has always had those types of contracts with the Canadian government for decades. It's essentially meaningless in terms of new additional value and is just keeping the overall status quo. This new contract replaces and consolidates expiring ones that BB already had.

For all the ""DD"" you folks pretend to do, repeatedly pointing to stuff like that just shows how little you actually know and are just desperately trying to get people on the BB train, one that's horribly run and barely able to actually make any money."

2021-04-20 08:57:35,wallstreetbets,"That’s difficult. I know why they would want to change it, but it’s also a big name. When somebody hears blackberry they know the company, but they associate it with phones, which is the bad thing."
2021-04-20 08:43:39,wallstreetbets,Haven’t looked into it. Was around 60% in January I believe? Might be interesting now... maybe we are missing something.
2021-04-20 12:06:01,wallstreetbets,S3 data from the Bloomberg terminal shows SI as 17.92 % of the float today.
2021-04-20 07:59:45,wallstreetbets,All I see is good news and their stock is driving further deeper into the dirt. I can't save them so I bought a bunch of puts.
2021-04-20 09:41:26,wallstreetbets,"This is a great response that provides realism to the case against BB. I'm long on BB but still recognize the multiple factors against the company and you have to temper that against your position, situation, and timeline for return. As the price keeps dropping it makes BB more attractive for entry too. We still need to see a lot of execution. I still love the stock!"
2021-04-20 06:06:35,wallstreetbets,Forgot sorry. I added them. 🚀
2021-04-20 12:23:09,wallstreetbets,Not only BB ist getting hammered
2021-04-20 08:04:49,wallstreetbets,if only the stock market just looked at RSI and made its decision we'd all be ~~billionaires~~ ~~millionaires~~ ~~thousandaires~~ higher than 0
2021-04-20 12:41:20,wallstreetbets,Stay strong brother. We comin.
2021-04-20 11:58:36,wallstreetbets,Yes 😂 But hey. Everybody love to come back at some point to things they loved in the past.
2021-04-20 11:38:06,wallstreetbets,calls arent really worth selling. The prices are hilariously low.
2021-04-20 11:18:35,wallstreetbets,Lets gooo. Firm Hand shake across the big puddle.
2021-04-20 12:04:17,wallstreetbets,Due diligence.
2021-04-20 12:41:00,wallstreetbets,"Nevermind qnx is not the same company it was when it was owned by HK. Mass exodus occurred when BB acquired and they’ve struggled to retain talent since (Apple strip mined them for starters - even took one of the cofounders).

I honestly don’t see why people think this stock is under valued, and would wager it is overvalued at the moment.

But maybe that’s a bias I carry having witnessed the free fall face plant the company took in my own city, and how it directly affected hiring and talent retention for them in the area, along with qnx.

As BB you’re gonna struggle when you have serious issues retaining talent, shaking your not so shiny rep, and nobody in the city really wants to work for you; especially when there are enough tech jobs to go around.

PS does anyone remember the deal Ford struck with BB for direct contract for QNX Infotainment Software? Incl transferring some employees directly to Ford? Well they dropped them for Google a few months back."

You are part of the problem if that is your actual thinking.
Fuck the small retail trader right? Only those with massive wallets have the right to make DD's."
2021-04-20 08:45:58,wallstreetbets,I took the news directly from blackberry ;)
2021-04-20 17:20:49,wallstreetbets,"Seriously. Have any of you even bothered to look at where it's been trading for the last *9 years*? You honestly think it's been under some secret attack from Wall Street for 9 years and during all that time they didn't announce contracts that they had won, yet still kept the price where it was at? It's because their revenue has been garbage all along and announcing new contracts doesn't mean old ones didn't expire and weren't renewed, meaning the announcements were just a wash.

The biggest announcement they've had recently has been their partnership with Amazon back in December. At that time it went from \~$5.60 to \~$8.30, which is where it's back at now. It only rocketed higher for those few days at the end of January because of the meme train. *Nothing else.* There has been no news of any actual consequence since then. All the other announcements have been small and some just a repackage of already existing expiring contracts that maintain their current unprofitable revenue. If you want to go really long, that's fine, but it's going to depend on what they actually produce with the Amazon partnership and that's still a *long* ways out.

There is no moon for BB."
2021-04-20 06:39:25,wallstreetbets,Steve Jobs also sold his positions in Apple at one point.
2021-04-20 10:10:28,wallstreetbets,All 400k worth of it.. That is peanuts
2021-04-20 06:26:20,wallstreetbets,"Shorts got their positions blown up. It wasnt a distraction. AMC is still cooking. 

I only own GME but there are millions of others stocks on the market"
2021-04-20 11:51:52,wallstreetbets,why did you lend BB a shovel. Lmao....bottom....
2021-04-20 14:24:14,wallstreetbets,"I paid $19.12 lol

Not quite the peak but very close"
2021-04-20 08:50:15,wallstreetbets,When I thought the GME train had left the station already(It hadn’t 🤦‍♂️)I went heavily on BlackBerry bc I figured of all the “meme stonks” it was the likeliest to fare well if it all went downhill. Reality is that $BB is faring the worst complete opposite. I’m still not selling ever for loss and believe in the company
2021-04-20 09:09:25,wallstreetbets,"ASO has been posted here since November.  Its been doing fine.  I think its only the ones that had massive spikes already.  I have positions in both.  Anyways, I cant understand how BB is under $9 myself... it makes no sense."
2021-04-20 11:51:57,wallstreetbets,"I got here shortly before GME-gate and there was always a core group - GME, AMC, BB, usually with a combination of TSLA, PLTR, NOK and a few others I'm forgetting.

They've all been screwed, ever since. Fin media loves to talk about overvaluation, but never seems to see anything going the other way..."
2021-04-20 14:57:46,wallstreetbets,"This is a distraction from GME sir please stop. JK, I'm all on BB comeback. Buying dips like crazy."
2021-04-20 13:00:25,wallstreetbets,"It's actually not that complex of a thing to understand: Blackberry doesn't make good money. 

Blackberry has proven over the past few years that they don't really know how to operate in this tech environment. Maybe that changes going forward, but they are an incredibly small company who makes next to nothing in revenue when compared to almost any other tech company and they somehow manage to lose money every single year.  Their most profitable endeavors seem to be selling tech that they patented 20+ years ago to companies that will probably leverage the IP and make 20x ROI while they eat stale hot dogs waiting to die. Unless of course they change course. I think they could use some fresh executive leadership. 

TL;DR: BB actually sux at business"
2021-04-20 13:47:50,wallstreetbets,Because GME opened everyone’s eyes. Just like Area 51 they can’t stop all of us. Now Wall Street are scared because a bunch of apes on reddit are using stimulus cheques to pull a Wall Street on Wall Street
2021-04-20 13:58:01,wallstreetbets,"I'm down 52% because I thought it was a long play.   
and Would have some good bounce.   
How can a tech company which should be doing well sucking soo much peen.   
Personally I'd hold off on BB at this price and wait for a couple months of growth other wise you're just going to get fucked like the rest of us."
2021-04-20 12:51:58,wallstreetbets,Plz no
2021-04-20 13:37:50,wallstreetbets,Every time I average down it goes down more
2021-04-20 10:38:56,wallstreetbets,"Wouldn’t be a startup company in the traditional sense. This company was well established in their respective market and had the resources and funds to start their new plan, unlike other startups who don’t have the same luxury sometimes.

It’s been a long while since they’ve made money. That’s the only thing stopping them from popping imo. Hopefully 2022-23 are great years for them."
2021-04-20 12:15:46,wallstreetbets,"Their total revenue keeps dipping, and they're not making profit. Most startups (especially in the cybersec space) have revenue growth of 30+%

Why should it be valued high if both revenue is dipping and losses are widening?"
2021-04-20 13:35:58,wallstreetbets,"Their software was $200 million in 2013 when Chen took over. They had a slide on it in a past ER. Showing where the company was when Chen took over and where it is now. They've also purchased Cylance, AtHoc, and a few others so it isn't organic growth like a startup either."
2021-04-20 11:55:50,wallstreetbets,explain?
2021-04-20 07:53:49,wallstreetbets,Those are one time sales and they’ve been pretty much dormant patents (for them) since they were related to their cell phone days.
2021-04-20 13:31:34,wallstreetbets,Like 2030 end or?
2021-04-20 14:06:40,wallstreetbets,BB kinda got lumped into meme stock status when it probably shouldn't have been. Point still stands though. I'm up 60% on the puts so my wife's boyfriend is pretty happy with me
2021-04-20 09:01:51,wallstreetbets,Should change it to “Research in Motion” or RIM has a nice ring to it.
2021-04-20 09:01:16,wallstreetbets,"Change name and make $$$, or keep name and wonder why nobody wants you...🤔"
2021-04-20 10:56:12,wallstreetbets,You just explained why the brand has negative value.  Switching should be easy.
2021-04-20 09:53:02,wallstreetbets,"There is certainly a lot of evidence for both a bull and a bear case. And I think something that these posts don't understand is that even if BB somehow became the market leader in cybersecurity / vehicle OS / etc it will take many **years**. Without weird fucky market volatility like January this stock won't blow up in the next couple months. It's a multi-year, buy and forget play - LEAPs or shares., not options a week from now.

Honestly, this stock is probably best suited to /r/investing."
2021-04-20 06:07:20,wallstreetbets,"Thank you, kind soul."
2021-04-20 06:51:18,wallstreetbets,"Wait, your position is only 110 shares of this cheap-ass stock?"
2021-04-20 09:32:31,wallstreetbets,"Yeah but no bad news that I saw, constantly going down, RSI way lower than it should be. Volume has been dropping a lot.

And no, I'd find a way to lose money anyway."
2021-04-20 13:09:22,wallstreetbets,"I hope so, I'm running out of $$ to keep averaging down.. LOL"
2021-04-20 15:18:31,wallstreetbets,But wsb needs to come back to BB. What has changed since January?
2021-04-20 12:56:39,wallstreetbets,Yea it’s not quite beer money. Need more IV lol

2021-04-20 08:52:15,wallstreetbets,"rofl, this is actually hilarious that you are supporting his point while trying to negate it:

> Yes, I pretty much had given up hope that the Apple board was going to do anything,"" Jobs said in an interview with Time magazine in editions to hit the stands this week. ""I didn't think the stock was going up."" 

[excerpt from this article explaining why he sold all his shares](https://www.cnet.com/news/its-official-jobs-sold-apple-stock/)"
2021-04-20 14:32:23,wallstreetbets,Lol....Ive got roughly 50 shares over $19.....been buying in blocks on the way down
2021-04-20 10:11:01,wallstreetbets,I too got fucked in this way. Eskimo bros.
2021-04-20 10:36:27,wallstreetbets,"I am with you, brother. 155 @ $16.62"
2021-04-20 13:03:49,wallstreetbets,"I mean, if you'd buy BB at current price, there's no need to sell it. That's how I always looked at it. Although short term wins might be unlikely now lol"
2021-04-20 13:31:14,wallstreetbets,"This is a longer term hold. I do believe the market will catch up with it, but I think it will be slower gains, not a 🚀."
2021-04-20 10:15:44,wallstreetbets,Average down
2021-04-20 11:31:05,wallstreetbets,Time to average down.
2021-04-20 13:30:05,wallstreetbets,"People messed up thinking BB is comparable to GME or AMC. BB has a very unfriendly CEO and management team towards retail shareholders, while GME and AMC are using retail to boost their companies. Simply look at BB signing off on $6 debentures to Fairfax while AMC went straight to the shareholders to raise cash. Secondly BB has massive amounts of shares. There will always be people selling stock since there is just to much out there and with dilution continually happening there will be more. BB is also doing pretty weak on the revenue side. I'm long BB for the potential but I have no illusions that if a shareholder was on fire Chen wouldn't even piss on them to put out the flames."
2021-04-20 16:01:01,wallstreetbets,I too like the stock.
2021-04-20 13:02:47,wallstreetbets,Samesies
2021-04-20 16:00:31,wallstreetbets,101 @ 9.83 and will buy more tmw if the low $8 sale continues
2021-04-20 13:48:47,wallstreetbets,"Agree, the revenue and earnings numbers look to explain a lot of this. While many companies saw greater revenue in Q1 2021, BB saw reduced revenue \*and\* spent a lot more money which reduced their earnings substantially. Perhaps those spent dollars were investments by BB to open up new revenue streams, but it takes time for that to translate to new revenue and more time to show proof it's substantial and sustained. 

Why invest now in a company that is searching for a bottom when that money could be put elsewhere? Why not give BB time to prove out their new revenue streams, invest in them later when the price is better and the news more likely to be solid. I suspect many buyers would be wondering that, which translates to fewer buyers. Current holders may be wondering the same and simply looking to re-enter at a better price or when their is better evidence there will be upwards movement. Overall not good news for BB stock for the next quarter or more."
2021-04-20 17:37:03,wallstreetbets,Plz yes I need to buy more shares at cheaper
2021-04-20 13:19:01,wallstreetbets,Revenue only dipped because they did not take into account the patent revenue since they are undergoing negotiations with a third party for a sale of those. If they were calculated as per normal they would have hit their target no problem.

2021-04-20 13:44:44,wallstreetbets,"Whoa, what's your hurry?"

2021-04-20 12:56:11,wallstreetbets,Then when you get hired you can say you got a RIM job
2021-04-20 10:40:16,wallstreetbets,Brilliant idea! They shoulda done that years ago!

2021-04-20 10:10:20,wallstreetbets,I would much rather Judge the DD based on the information presented instead. If anything having a big position on something just incentivizes people to omit key points to generate hype.

2021-04-20 14:44:41,wallstreetbets,BB just won a contract to do all cybersecurity for the government of Canada.
2021-04-20 13:59:57,wallstreetbets,"No revenue dipped because they didn't monetise those patents because they were going to sell them - they'd have to refuse to sell them in order to keep the license money.

And if it was just license revenue causing a 25% dip YoY then selling those patents is just going to sink revenue lower.

Not to mention revenue has been dropping over the last few years; 2019 was the only positive year for revenue growth in 5 years. There's been 6 quarters of revenue growth compared to 13 quarters of decline in the last 5 years, comparing it to other cybersecurity companies like Cloudflare that regularly report 50% YoY growth doesn't make sense."
2021-04-20 13:38:33,wallstreetbets,"I checked out glass door. I know it probably isn't very reliable but overall it said the same thing you just posted. On the positives the reviews said they give out great snacks. Negatives were shit work culture and horrible management. Win some, lose some I guess."

2021-04-20 10:57:02,wallstreetbets,"Exactly. Confirmation Bias go BRRRRR. 

In fact probably the best DD (from a peer-reviewed science perspective) is counter DD (probably from someone who has a small or no position, but genuinely wants to discover if there's an opportunity there)"
2021-04-20 13:41:49,wallstreetbets,280 @ 14USD and I'm chilling. Got some money coming my way in autumn I'm hoping it stays down until then.
2021-04-20 11:48:17,wallstreetbets,350 @ 9.88 and I need GME to do something so I can buy more BB while it's so low :(
2021-04-20 15:06:07,wallstreetbets,It consolidated multiple expiring contracts it already had into a new one. It barely moves the needle in terms of real new revenue.
2021-04-20 19:23:41,wallstreetbets,Pretty sure every public company has those exact same comments from former/present employees.
2021-04-20 14:00:36,wallstreetbets,That’s not wrong. Stick to whatever you’re comfortable with. At the end of the day no one knows what’s going to happen to any stock.
2021-04-20 12:34:25,wallstreetbets,"I've got my eye on BB, if the premiums were worth a bit more I'd be selling CCs."
2021-04-20 14:33:27,wallstreetbets,i’m thinking about selling all my bb and buying more GME tbh
2021-04-20 19:37:26,wallstreetbets,True. That's why I don't trust it overly much. Older companies will generally have worse reviews than startups because of this. I still like to check because simply because I like to see if there is a reoccurring theme or not.

2021-04-20 07:23:22,wallstreetbets,"The Consumer Product Safety Commission video of the recent PTON treadmill accident is brutal.  
  
The child is fine, just terrified. Most treadmills have a ""pressure"" sensor that will stop turning when it feels too much resistance. With the PTON tread sitting a few inches higher and what looks like no ""pressure"" sensor, the treadmill will just pull harder and increase torque when it feels resistance. Great for high intensity sprints, but this leads to small kids, animals, and toys getting sucked underneath the treadmill.    
  
Child is fine. Here's the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onXNnlCYJ4Y  

Puts on PTON. No unsupervised kiddos in your gyms!"

There appears to be some profit taking going on after a strong week last week when the Dow and S&P closed at records.

We did get disappointing earnings from United Airlines yesterday and this is of course a proxy for the pandemic reopening trade. Almost all other major earnings reports have beaten estimates.

At the time of this writing, more reports came in with J&J beating on earnings and revenues. We’re due to hear from a bunch of other blue chips today, including Lockheed Martin, Philip Morris, Procter & Gamble, and Netflix.

Nothing in terms of economic data releases today, but we are getting a bit of a surge in daily reported COVID cases in the U.S. that could be weighing on markets as well.

We’ve seen that movie before. All things being equal, this may be a buying opportunity."

2021-04-20 09:36:26,wallstreetbets,"$MVIS

One argument I keep seeing against this stock is that it already ran 3000% or whatever over a year. This company was struggling during Covid with product partners pulling out of deals. They have been spending money developing their best-in-class lidar over several years. The company was and still is being shorted into the ground for not having much revenue.

The same shit was being pulled with GME, except because MVIS is a smaller company, shorts could really go to town and drag the share price into the dirt. The share price last year was NOT indicative whatsoever of the value of this company.

Their lidar technology is ahead of any other lidar manufacturer (and yet MVIS has the lowest market cap), their technology is in Hololens2 (~$22billion army deal) and they have a fuck ton of patents (AR/VR & AV). Microsoft, Google, Apple, Facebook, they all need their tech and MVIS is up for sale.

The real value of MVIS is signifcantly higher than the current share price indicates and MVIS is ready this year to show what they got. Shorts better get out or they will get burnt hard.

TLDR: Fuck shorts man."

2021-04-20 14:57:07,wallstreetbets,"**Personal thoughts on AAPL event:**

**Air Tags:** at $30 these are going to sell like hotcakes and will ultimately be a part of most iPhone user's lives... think of how many that is...

**Podcast subscriptions:** Brand new revenue stream for AAPL. Uncertain how this will work out for them, and I am unconvinced as yet... still it adds to their bottom line however.

**Expanded Apple Card Eligibility:** Great move by AAPL. This can only increase profits.

**New iMac:** The M1 chip is a monster and they can squeeze extra performance out of it by applying more power in a desktop configuration. Colours? I don't give a shit... but there are a lot of people that do. MANY people have been waiting for an Apple Silicon iMac since Apple Silicon was announced last year... floodgates are going to open on orders.

**Apple TV 4K:** Decent performance and functionality update, but the real star of the show is the new Siri Remote. I think folks underestimate how much the previous version was despised by the Apple community. These are going to fly off the shelves.

**iPad Pro XDR:** This is an amazing update, but I think it is limited to more of a niche market. Will be substantially eclipsed in sales by the smaller version, which will do very well at that price point. M1 chip inclusion COULD have enabled them to run macOS Big Sur on it which would be a total game changer, allowing you to run Mac apps on it. We could very well see this in the future.

**Purple iPhone:** Who gives a fuck? Very niche.

All-in-all this is a very solid lineup and I am extremely bullish on the company moving forward, especially with the new top-tier iMacs and MacBooks coming later this year based on the much anticipated M1x Apple Silicon chip manufactured by TSMC."

Ofc, all the ""I told you so"" folks in r/stocks would tell me something like, ""Well, that's why you should have fallen in line and rotated out."" Well, I can't do that if I'm holding these positions for long, can I? It still hurts to watch."

2021-04-20 13:10:13,wallstreetbets,"Convince me that this YOLO idea is really fucking stupid.

* AGG (aggregate bond market) overall trending down, no surprise there, interest rates are rising.
* Long-dated put options on AGG are HELLA CHEAP.  We're talking 6-8% IV.
* Every sign points to economy overheating and interest rates are projected to continue rising this year.  Just this past week we've seen like 4 FP posts here about people bragging about their stupid ass 20:1 leveraged ETF strats (they think borrowing a fuckton literally can't go tits up).

The last point is just the retail microcosm of the broader credit bubble.  There's too much liquidity and nowhere intelligent to put it.

Yes JPow will continue his policy but interest rates will continue to steadily rise likely anyway.  When company, retail, and fund defaults increase this will put even more strain on rates."

3. JD earnings May 21st and the stock has been severely beat down.
4. Book value of JD is $120/share. At least 35% upside based on only fundamentals. Politics aside.
5. JD is supposed to announce JD logistics IPO soon.
6. Cathie Wood bought a fuck ton of JD yesterday on multiple of her ETFs.

2021-04-20 12:10:26,wallstreetbets,"Good spot to watch on SPY is the 9 EMA at 411.80ish. If we keep rejecting that its likely going to start making its way down to test the 20 EMA around 406.20.

Also we have a big gap to fill between 401 and 403. So if we get a nice rally and retake the 9 EMA loading up on puts at a 403 strike 2 months out would be solid. Markets tend to not like leaving gaps open for too long.

We are testing the 9 ema right now, even if we get above I wouldn't dump your longer puts just yet especially if you bought them friday. Nice protection to flip some calls on rallies."

Still bull above 400. Still holding 4/23 410p.

2021-04-20 13:43:53,wallstreetbets,Yeah I don’t know how the mods have done it but this feels like the WSB of old (by which I mean 6 months ago). I can actually see DD on various different companies without having to filter by “controversial” or wade through 50 low-quality GME posts - it’s a miracle!
2021-04-20 09:39:23,wallstreetbets,As a CLOV bag holder I am cool with it.

2021-04-20 09:03:20,wallstreetbets,WSB was becoming a “buy and hold” sub that talked about a single stock. There are 2 echo chambers already dedicated to that and filled to the top with absolute crazies. WSB doesn’t need to be a 3rd GME diamond hand den of retardation.

2021-04-20 13:41:15,wallstreetbets,"Alright so...

8 years ago I was just a young 18 year old from San Diego only a couple months out of high school. Me and 3 friends decided to go to Nocturnal Wonderland, an electronic music festival in San Bernardino. We also decided to stay with one of my group member's friends from back home in Florida that had randomly moved to LA and become a male model.

(Wasn't really any closer to SB than our own homes, but fuck it, our parents wouldve been too nosy between nights of the festival) So, we pack up early and drive out to LA and to the hotel said model was currently living out of.

Once we get there we all promptly eat some marijuana infused chocolate bars and start drinking. Eventually, model-boi decides he wants to get another tattoo and 1 of my group mates goes with him while 3 of us chill with a couple of the other people staying in the room and eventually the 3 of us take a nap.

We are eventually awoken by one of the other residents of the room saying ""ANDY DICK IS COMING!"" in an excited tone. Not really caring, we went back to sleep. Until Andy Dick showed up that is...

An indeterminate amount of time later, me and my girlfriend are awoken by Andy Dick crouching very close next to us and saying things like ""AWWWWWW HOW CUUUUUUUTE!"" After the 2 of us fully awaken he moves onto our friend, a guy with very long red hair who is still asleep, and starts playing with his hair while saying ""LOOK AT THE PRETTY GIRL!"" which awakens my friend who is high on xanax so he's slow, groggy, and confused.

Over the course of the next couple hours Andy Dick says a bunch of stupid shit, drinks tons of rolling rock out of this case he had brought in with him, and, at one point, some half naked girl storms into the hotel room saying she ran out of cocaine which prompts Andy to ask if she can get more. She says yes and runs out of the room never to be seen again.

At some point the other inhabitants of the hotel room convince Andy to take some acid and he does. After that, he got a LOT more crazy invasive and sexual. He offered my friend $1000 to show him his dick, which my friend declined. And after not too much longer of Andy being aggressively sexual, my friend tells him to back the fuck up or he's going to beat the shit out of him. Andy leaves the room.

About 30 minutes later, me and my girlfriend decide we're hungry and leave the room to walk to a subway just down the street as it is now like 10PM and we have barely eaten all day. After exiting the elevator that let us out on the side of the building, we see Andy sitting on the ground with a potted cactus in his hand. Andy is petting the cactus while sobbing ""I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.""

We continued past him and never saw him again."

The market and apparently lots of retail shorts apparently are losing their shit at the mere suggestion of buying this stock... the SI is definitely still high.  

Since the downside seems fairly small at this point, my suggestion is buying the dip with a small amount you don't mind losing."
2021-04-20 07:17:09,wallstreetbets,Probably trash
2021-04-20 07:19:45,wallstreetbets,Yesterday was as good as it gets. It's over.

While I do see the bull case for GME pivoting, it's hard to know the fair value atm especially on the back of one good quarter boosted by new console generations. Time will tell but it looks increasingly like game companies are trying to cut out the middlemen"
2021-04-20 07:48:15,wallstreetbets,"As for shorting it thats retarded, your paying a premium to borrow it while waiting for the kids to get bored and the whales behind them to find better uses for there money and taking all the risk....   Medium term puts are a solid play IMO.  Some kids are going to downvote me to hell but oh well...."
2021-04-20 07:12:48,wallstreetbets,"I think they're somewhat in denial.

After Sherman leaves, the entire board will have been replaced by chewy/amazon ecommerce executives. 

People are still evaluating a fair price based on a %141 shorted retail company during a pandemic, and leave no room for speculation, even though gamestop will almost certainly pivot."

2021-04-20 05:15:54,wallstreetbets,"Where did you read that? Wasn't that only deferred income in form of 12k shares, that he sold during the squeeze in January? That would be nothing, because iirc the rest of his shares were performance-restricted. I'm just curious, not trying to preach anything here.

Edit: So I looked it up and yes, the execs sold shares. According to [Reuters](https://mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKBN29Y1S8) it was during the run-up in January at around 12.60-13$. Three execs sold a combined 1.7 million $ worth of shares. That's like 130k shares at 13$, so it's not really worth mentioning. If anything, it tells us that they thought BB was overvalued during the squeeze, but who didn't know that. 
I also found this [DD](https://amp.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l244h3/dd_on_bb_cfo_selling_shares/) by u/Fair_Chart3403 on the ""sellout""."

2021-04-20 08:39:42,wallstreetbets,"I don't get it. The short squeeze already happened. If you turned \~$14,000 into a million and didn't sell out... you are an idiot. Or you are hiding the majority of the profits you already took and not showing us those.  


If you are rich and just grandstanding... you are bored.  


Either way, the stock is overvalued.  


Still, there may very well be enough apes to make this thing go through the ceiling again and smack into the moon."
2021-04-20 15:46:07,wallstreetbets,But U do realize you’re at a loss overall???
2021-04-20 06:22:54,wallstreetbets,"I just can't understand how I am so much worse at life than you that I was significantly distressed the other day when I burned gas money getting to Plato's Closet to sell jeans only to find out they won't take any girl sizes over 30.""

2021-04-20 14:57:38,wallstreetbets,"You realize he's posting a $30k LOSS on Reddit. Check out his cost casis relative to the market value. Why boast about what a shitty investment he's made?

Uh, it literally says 7,000 shares. Not contracts, shares. And the cost basis is $1.1 million. Not sure how you missed all that and thought it was options with a lower cost basis.

2021-04-20 06:44:23,wallstreetbets,"What makes you think that? AMC is arguably better than BlackBerry, Nokia and all the other shitty nonsense.

If GameStop squeezes, AMC will squeeze too. It is the same hedge funds that short the company"

Also millionaires aren't growing in their attic, wtf. An attic grow would yield shitty results and no one would want to buy that shit, not to mention you wouldn't have enough room to be able to yield anything worthwhile. You need to be able to control the climate well if you want to grow quality.

2021-04-20 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"The mental game. Hey WSB apes, I am seeking advice on how some people on here deal with the stress or panic of losses, and avoid selling, not necessarily gme but with every other stock also. I know alot of you have rules of entry and exit, but even then I am sure there is a mental battle to either panic sell and then buy on the rise, i have done it too many times lol. Now I am getting to the point of not wanting to be involved or invest because of the stress it has given me the past 2 months, even though I am up money, I am stressed over the potential gains I missed out on, especially when I knew better. So how do you guys deal with the stress, and remove emotion from the stocks.. because emotions lead to losses in my case."
2021-04-20 05:31:48,wallstreetbets,"The way I look at it, whenever you trade you’ll always have regrets. You either took profits too early, too late, got in too early, too late, didn’t put enough in at the beginning, etc. There is no perfect trade, and if you look at the charts later you’ll always wish you did something different even if you made money. Don’t look back when you take profits, and treat a loss as a learning experience. Setting trailing stops going in can keep your game plan focused and prevent you from getting greedy. And if the money you have in it stressed you out, you’re probably over committed. Try trading with a third of the money you have in your account right now and see how that changes your stress level. Remember the more stressed you are the less you’ll be able to make logical decisions, and that’s when you’ll start making the wrong call and getting needlessly risky."
2021-04-20 05:19:59,wallstreetbets,"Take a walk, sit in the sun, fly a kite, ride a bike, volunteering, basically any hobby you already like to do helps.   Try not to put an emotion on money..It's just a object."

To prevent it from happening again, you need to do your own research."
2021-04-20 05:48:04,wallstreetbets,"I can relate. I have “investment money” with legitimate investors, mutuals and retirement accounts.

I’m just learning and have almost no risk tolerance. I consider this a learning period where I’m basically figuring out how stocks move, all the crap that happens and how to bail when need be. But to answer your direct question, after being stuck with stocks that tanked, I now set a stop sell limit around my initial investment. I’d rather break even than be stuck holding. This will unfortunately never make you money. Big money comes with big risks and as many of the apes around here say big balls to hold. Considering I have no dick or balls, that may also be part of my problem, but I sleep good at night."

Go in with the assumption that you will lose your money, and with that don’t invest more than you can afford to lose.

All the hype of GME really showed how stupid some people are with stocks, for instance, a guy got money from a drug dealer and put it into GME expecting it to moon.

It didn’t.

Drug dealer wants his money back, guy can’t get it back because it’s negative.

The guy literally asked on the post if you can get a refund on stocks.

Edit: I bought in GME a little bit ago, when it jumped up to 260 I held, thinking it was mooning, I was looking at double profits. 

Do I regret holding? Yes, but I don’t dwell on it, there’s no predicting the stock market. You act with the best information you have available to you."

Hindsight is 20/20 but at the time, you made the best informed decision you could.  It's DISCIPLINE.

2021-04-20 11:46:59,wallstreetbets,Do you intend on holding stock long term and believe it's fundamentals are solid? Yes? Than short term changes mean nothing. It's only a loss (or profit) when you sell. Do your DD and you'll be more relaxed during ups and downs.

You want to optimize your entry and exit NOT maximize it.

What does this mean? Assuming you're not just in an ETF during a bull run then you will be in the red quite often after entry. 

My portfolio is down 12% overall at the moment. And that was with buying significant dips. I figure I might very well see 20% down this month. But my upside is 30% up on my fundamental thesis so gotta ride it out.

This saved me from holding PLTR, TLRY, APHA and GME bags (I'm holding enough already tyvm). Once you're in profit zone, set it to like 20%. Keep tightening it on the way up. 

Could you miss out on a moon shot from volatility? Yes. But you also won't be watching it drill down from ATH hoping it goes back up. If a stock zoomed up to $100 say, and dipped back to $90, if I was watching it on my own I'd be hoping for it to go to at least $102 THEN I'll sell. Problem is when its back at $75 its already too late and I was wishing I locked in profits at $90."

> Texas police will serve search warrants on Tesla Inc. on Tuesday to secure data from a fatal car crash in the state over the weekend, Reuters reported, citing a senior officer.

> What Happened: The move comes after Tesla CEO Elon Musk claimed on Twitter that data logs recovered so far showed the car&#039;s Autopilot driver assistance system was not enabled and the car had not purchased Tesla&#039;s full-self driving software.

> Musk has claimed that Tesla with Autopilot engaged is approaching a 10 times lower chance of accident than the average car.

The problem with vision only and no defined map is that the system infers 'markings'.  If it infers incorrectly it will let you activate AP.  Remember that a product is only as good as the QA and the QA for vision only NN is limited in scope to all available areas that were tested or simulated.  There is absolutely a possibility that AP was activated.  With that said, Elon probably didn't expect the car to allow usage in edge cases like this and that is why he said lane markings are required.  That was the design and the spec.  Doesn't mean the engineers delivered on it 100% successfully."

But if Tesla knows that it’s system fucked up and they tell the media that it did, what do you think is going to happen? Tesla sales will take a hit. You don’t buy a Tesla because you want a car. No, you buy a Tesla because you want a car that can auto pilot itself. Crash’s like these need to be investigated to find out what went wrong.

2021-04-20 16:03:28,wallstreetbets,Welcome to the Gun Control Debate.
2021-04-20 10:57:02,wallstreetbets,"\^  
my gf drives a tesla and chauffeurs me around now. she has limit tested the shit out of it. if there are no lines on the road, you cannot activate autopilot. the picture of the strip of road involved in the crash didn't have lines at any point. it is virtually impossible to turn on autopilot for the entirety of their drive. 

to play devil's advocate, i wouldn't say the chance is literally 0.00000% that autopilot was off (i do see the autopilot do weird things when 1 lane splits into 2 with no lines to guide; the autopilot does not turn off for that duration which is about 20-35 feet). but the autopilot errs on the side of safety. and to activate it in the first place, it must have lines. so the chances are virtually 0%.

in my opinion - the driver wanted to showboat the acceleration on their small curvy road. they did the 0-60 in 5 seconds or whatever, didn't think about centripetal force, crashed in to the tree on the outside of the curve, and died. news gets a hold of tesla crashing and person dying, and immediately say 'autopilot' to make tesla stock go down.

actual tesla drivers know that the media is lying about this one... i am not a tesla fanboy myself (my gf is), so i feel unbiased in this. i still drive my 2012 accord and love it. i have never driven a tesla. all my observations are from my gf driving a tesla.

there are plenty of situations where the autopilot needs work - for instance, it needs to detect cars merging on to the highway better, and give them more space to merge. it needs to work on lanes splitting and not taking the 'average' path which is in the middle of the now-split-into-2 lanes. it needs to reduce the max speed when on a highway exit ramp. it needs to deal with all intersections slightly better.

i'm 100% with elon on this one. it's media frenzy to take down tesla."
2021-04-20 07:53:03,wallstreetbets,"Agreed.

They may have been able to force some level of cruise control to turn on. (depending on the year of car). But even then, the driver not being in the seat seems unlikely without intentionally tricking the system."

We all know they will likely never achieve 9 million units a year as Toyota does. Likely not to make the top 5 like Ford and GM.  So if Toyota is capped at 200b,  gm at 80b, and Ford at 50b, this means automotive wise they wouldn't be more than 100b based on sales and performance.  So where's the other 600b in cap justified?

We know the cars aren't designed to be FSD, situations like this just create doubt (whether right or wrong) that we are ready to move in a FSD society.

Think of all the manufacturer recalls literally every manufacturer are subject to every year because I dunno an airbag manufacturer screwed up, or your ignition in your cars suddenly turn off 

Tesla for one isn’t subject to those via OTA updates and they don’t have to pay other manufacturers to assemble their vehicles

I know that was a little scatterbrained but I think there undervalued even if you consider them as an auto manufacturer"
2021-04-20 15:23:50,wallstreetbets,"Yea but you added in a bunch of bullshit on your own. You are right that the media used the publics' focus on TSLA to make a stupid clickbait article I don't think anyone is surprised by the media whoring for attention.   


My problem is with your implication of FSD tech not being there yet, when in fact this accident is a perfect example of how it would have saved lives in a stupid situation like that. It's not extreme overvaluation, it's a solid valuation based on amazing technology that will change the future, it already has changed the industry more than anything in the last 50 years.   


TSLA imo is undervalued. FSD is constantly improving, there is no possibility or future of AI learning to achieving near-perfect driving in the future, that is not up to debate. What can be debated is how much autonomous driving is worth and imo it should be worth way more compared to the price it has.   


And other car companies are worth less because they have nothing to show for the future but unproven promises. You invest into the future, not into what something is worth now. In fact if other car companies didn't say they will TRY to do the same thing TSLA is ALREADY doing, they would have lost 50% of their worth overnight."

It'll fall as negligence from the customer even if auto was engaged"

1 - close the seatbelt in the driver's seat behind you

2 - get in the drivers seat, start autopilot, then set the speed to zero (or near-zero)

3 - climb to the passenger seat

4 - turn the autopilot speed up

End result is you may have autopilot running. I guess if you get the speed up high enough on a street where autopilot can engage and then the car travels to a street where autopilot disengages but it is going to fast, it might not stop in time, rather perhaps it will blare all sorts of warnings at you to take control.

Whatever... people will always figure out ways to beat any system you devise. At some point there has to be personal responsibility and it is not the manufacturer's fault."

They just slap a body and interior on a compatible chassis. Very true for GM, dodge, jeep products etc.. Ford and Toyota, not as much. When people say things like “one Tesla goes up in flames and all hell breaks loose” I think Tesla did it to themselves. Things like the fact you can only have your car worked on at Tesla raise a lot of questions for me. It’s easy to cover up problems if all problems come roosting home."
2021-04-20 06:42:22,wallstreetbets,"Stats absolutely can lie by comparing different things.

Currently most stats are comparing accident rates while driving in *all* conditions including extreme adverse weather where accident rates are far higher with assisted driving features that can only be turned on in selected ideal conditions where the system is confident of its ability.

Its sampling bias because self driving features self limit the situations they are active in while human drivers don’t have that luxury. To make a real comparison, you’d need to normalize to compare the accident rates for human drivers in the specific driving conditions when autopilot or other features *could have been active, but weren’t*."

2021-04-20 06:45:05,wallstreetbets,"Well, either it’s full autonomous like Tesla claims or it’s not lol. You gotta take your pick. Problem with a car like Tesla is that, like the previous post said, it can’t take in accounts things that people do. People road rage, people don’t follow the law, people are people no matter what they will drive. Not only that, but slot of the issues with car accidents in the US is just how poorly our cities are designed. We are all centered in. Suburbs and isolated communities far away from our work or grocery stores etc. that we spend so much of our times in cars. Take the Europeans perspective where they rely more on public transport and simply walking to commute to the various places. By contrast, I have to use my car for 100% of my commute because pumice transport in the states is shit and everything is pretty far out. Point is, American Cities are car oriented, with us spending more time driving. The you drive or are in the road, the more you are at risk of being in an accident. You would need ever single car in the US to be completely automated to cut out the human factor, which won’t be happening anytime soon."

Not yet. All Tesla cars require active driver supervision and are not autonomous. With the FSD Computer, we expect to achieve a new level of autonomy as we gain billions of miles of experience using our features. The activation and use of these features are dependent on achieving reliability far in excess of human drivers, as well as regulatory approval, which may take longer in some jurisdictions."

Everytime people take these studies they take up Nhtsa data (which involves cars from 1900s i guess) and give a very distinct impression that no other car but tesla is safe. 

To be honest most modern cars with active safety features are safe. And things like AEB factors more into safety than autopilot. 

But i agree with the fact that in the given scope of autopilot alone, tesla might be safer than a human. But  i am saying that the scope is like <20(random non 100 number) % of regular driving."

IMO Tesla  have so few cars on road to be honest. And their presence is there only in developed countries. These cars are not workhorses like accords or fords.

Newer cars tend to be less prone to fatal crashes as well. Passive safety has come a long way in the last 15 years or so.

I used to wish our cities were designed like European cities too until I actually had to live in one short term. Spending 2 months working in the Netherlands (pretty much the gold standard globally for public transit systems) made me appreciate our car-centric city designs. My hotel was 4 miles from my office and I would have to give myself an hour in the morning... 5min walk to the tram, tram to the train, 5min walk from train, and then buffer time every step along the way to make the schedules work (heaven forbid you run 5min late one morning). Or you could do a 30min bike ride, be at the mercy of the weather, and need a shower once you get to the office. Then I got home and my similar commute distance takes less than 10min, I can leave whenever I feel like it, and I can go from home to air-conditioned car to office without ever getting rained on or sweaty.

Tesla have said themselves it's not always capable of spotting stop signs, safety features can't respond in all situations, can't autosteer on city streets and requires a fully attentive driver with hands on the wheel at all times, who can react at any moment.

When your dealing with competition,  your product vs others has features which provide benefits to the consumer who ultimately opts to purchase your product.  Tesla right now has a feature that provides the greatest benefit to many consumers being the battery.  While the other features have their own benefits, the other features aren't the driving factor to the consumers decision to buy the car.  Once the other automakers have their own EV options,  that negates the single largest feature/benefit to the consumer to buy a tesla. Just like the majority of the auto market, the other features unique to each brand help a consumer decide what's best for them,  but everyone opts different. Otherwise, we would only 1 or 2 brands.  The point is,  the other tech in a tsla may be cool,  but the feature/benefit ratio is not the same to the consumer as the battery is and many consumers may not see the benefit of value to it to decide they only want a tsla. This is why the growth should not be expected to compound at the same or larger rate in the next decade."
2021-04-20 15:52:23,wallstreetbets,"I agree with you there.  This is why we all invest.

Each investor calculates differently the value that they see vs the premium that they pay today.  The concern I have is that your 1000x earnings now which means your paying heavily for this future unknown.  In addition to the added risk of the company not performing to expectation,  you have the risk magnified on the overall market performance. Just a simple market correction on PE could send it the other way.  

I tend to look for those who have unnecessarily been beaten down first,  so i'm buying the future cheap. It takes a lot more to move a 700b company at 1000x to a double value than it does a 2-3b company whose close to book value. 

Just my opinion,  not saying there's anything wrong. My original statement was made in response to the attack on why the media magnifies an issue when it comes to a tesla.  I'm not trying to convince anyone to exit their position,  nor do i suggest that they have no room to go up."

I’m not going to pretend like we don’t have traffic issues (I grew up in Houston so I know that hell), but the cases where good public transit would decrease commute times and increase convenience are rare. Considering my previous comment specifically talked about how one of the “gold standard” public transit systems (The Hague, NL) took 45min-1hr to commute 4 miles, I guarantee that you wouldn’t be saving any time using public transit for a 24mi commute. Instead of spending an hour in the privacy and comfort of your own vehicle, you would likely be spending even more time hopping between multiple forms of transit while packed in with strangers and exposed to the elements at transition points."

There is a small handful of cities in the US that are densely populated enough for it to make sense, but car travel will still be way more convenient for the vast majority. Also, generally, creating the infrastructure for the public transit systems will decrease travel lanes for cars, decrease parking availability, and increase taxes. Public transit infrastructures are very “all or nothing” in that they need to be the primary method of transportation for a large majority of the population to make sense."

2021-04-20 11:08:39,wallstreetbets,"I have provided facts multiple times and you just re-posted the two links I shared while simultaneously pretending I haven’t provided facts, but here is even more explanation...

Tesla needs to say it’s not autonomous yet for liability protection; this is pretty obvious so I’m surprised it has to be explained. Once they are fully autonomous and Tesla Insurance has rolled out more fully then they would be able to take on the liability of driving autonomously. Until then it needs to be the driver’s responsibility and they still need help ironing out bugs. 

It’s a beta version which is why it’s “not currently” autonomous from a regulatory perspective (I’ve explained this several times now to multiple people in the above comments). There is very little framework for the rolling out of autonomous vehicles on a nationwide basis since it’s new tech so Tesla has developed their own approach starting with an ever-increasing “beta” version that will roll out more broadly over time. 

There are videos all over YouTube showing many beta drivers going through many difficult situations autonomously at Level 4 (driver oversight since it’s still beta and for liability protection). Here are a few recent ones:

I’m shocked how hard it seems to be for people to understand that you need to roll this out over time. You act like they should be able to launch a fully autonomous robo-taxi without collecting any data from public driving conditions. No one is rolling out autonomous driving this way since it‘s not possible nor would it be safe to roll out broadly right from the start. 

Waymo and Cruise have paid engineers to oversee this training. Tesla has used “shadow mode” in their fleet of cars sold to customers and then now has allowed a subset of FSD purchasers to continue the training more directly. I have a feeling you have never seen any of this FSD Beta video footage before making your uninformed accusations."

2021-04-20 09:08:10,wallstreetbets,"It’s not a contradiction to have Level 4/5 capable technology that still is in beta. Not sure why that’s hard to understand.

The definitions of the levels are right here:

2021-04-20 10:09:59,wallstreetbets,can you back that up at ALL?
2021-04-20 10:45:12,wallstreetbets,"I'm just saying that while yes of course they are going to try to make their competitors look bad, this idea that the old guard are responsible for every bad look that Tesla gives off is ridiculous, because they have a vested interest in people believing in EV while also being skeptical of other EV manufacturers, which is a delicate balance."
2021-04-20 15:06:25,wallstreetbets,"Yes bro, the world is all about what you and I think and not the 99% of simple-minded folks that rule the world and tell you what to do. You show them! Be different. 

TSLA forces every car company on the planet to change and even disturb other industries, and the guy is still not impressed lmao."
2021-04-20 07:40:53,wallstreetbets,"""Once the other automakers have their own EV options"" this right here - No other auto manufacturer is anywhere close to Tesla in terms of their technology and software advantage right now. 
How quickly do you think the other top auto manufacturers need to catch up before it's simply too late, and they either can't compete or end up licencing Tesla's own tech into their own cars? The longer  they take to catch up, the more inevitable it becomes that they either simply cannot compete or they end up paying Tesla masses of cash anyway"
2021-04-20 16:05:43,wallstreetbets,"Obviously any investments bring risks. And it depends on your style but I don't like investing into beaten stocks as I don't know if they will ever get up or not and I simply don't see anything even close to what TSLA offers. So far the competition only managed to bring out a few inferior electric cars. Not to mention nobody is even close to catching up to TSLA's FSD.   


To me it would be like investing into BB, Nokia, Ericson once iPhone made it on the market."
2021-04-20 15:48:01,wallstreetbets,"24 mile commute in the nyc area would be insane. Had to commute to NJ before and would take an hour on a good day, 2 hours with traffic. The next job I got was a 12 minute drive."
2021-04-20 12:35:26,wallstreetbets,24 miles is just 20% above the average commute.
2021-04-20 09:26:02,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I think I see what you mean now. Most US cities are spread out since they were built with cars in mind. Public transportation is nice in those cities like New York, where the traffic can honestly make driving slower than walking."
2021-04-20 14:38:36,wallstreetbets,"Oh please. Your comparing the incompetency of a national government who willingly led their nations into crisis because they thought that they were smart enough to game their system. US cities since the 50’s have been willingly following into the Ponzi Scheme, kicking the can down further the road, but the road ends eventually, literally. Why do you think our government for the last 3 administration not tried to fix the infrastructure of our nation? Because the cost would be mammoth. We rely on new development to pay for the old ones. Problem with that is you can’t indefinitely keep doing that you would have to keep making new development to pay for the older one and the on and on it goes. When our cities stock growing, you’ll see the US starting to decline."
2021-04-20 09:01:43,wallstreetbets,You are still referring to teslas page and saying it is level 4/level 5. Can you please explain what is level4/5 ?
2021-04-20 09:09:12,wallstreetbets,"In no way i said it is not self driving, i said it is not level 4 or 5. It is level 2 or 3 at most. There is no fallback for the ODD. Driver needs to be attentive. There is no high level automation and the naming is deceptive. 

You have no idea about the industry and is talking out of your ass with zero knowledge on what SAE levels of autonomy are."
2021-04-20 11:28:01,wallstreetbets,"Yes, I mentioned I used your link in my comment. My point was the only ""proof"" you've provided didn't agree with you. Level 4 or 5 requirements as per **your link** were not met.

Those videos also don't prove anything. It's anecdotal evidence - anecdotal evidence that doesn't even prove your point - 1 minute into the first video the driver adjusts the steering wheel. That at least instantly disqualifies it from Level 5, and tbh considering there was no input from the vehicle disqualifies it from Level 4 (level 4 says human action may be required with the request of the vehicle).

You're mixing up two points that don't make sense - I am not disagreeing that you need a beta for training data. I am disagreeing that it is level 4 or level 5 autonomous driving - even Tesla itself has stated otherwise. 

Tesla have stated its Level 2: [https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a35785277/tesla-fsd-california-self-driving/#:\~:text=The%20correspondence%20between%20Tesla%20and,autonomous%20features%20to%20its%20vehicles](https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a35785277/tesla-fsd-california-self-driving/#:~:text=The%20correspondence%20between%20Tesla%20and,autonomous%20features%20to%20its%20vehicles).

Liability and the tech are the exact same problem; if the tech was actually level 5 autonomous, why would they care about the liability? It should drive better than any human. 

Not to mention Tesla FSD beta drivers have mentioned they sign a liability waiver..

2021-04-20 11:28:50,wallstreetbets,Are you incapable of reading? I literally mentioned that was the link he posted - because it didn't agree with what he said. Get off reddit and go learn basic literacy.
2021-04-20 10:51:48,wallstreetbets,"I'm sorry but my read is that Tesla's tech is currently at a 3 on a good day, and the transition to 4 or 5 is a quantum leap that the company hasn't taken yet."
2021-04-20 10:11:33,wallstreetbets,In that sense i guess riding on elephants are safer than cars.
2021-04-20 10:12:31,wallstreetbets,Try coming opposite way in a narrow road. And check what the autopilot/propilot/driver assist does.
2021-04-20 15:23:17,wallstreetbets,"Are you actually learning deficient? Tesla as a company is impressive, owning a Tesla is not impressive. Those are two separate things, only one of which we have been talking about."
2021-04-20 08:45:10,wallstreetbets,Yeah a lot of people just assume that other car companies can just “do batteries” and catch up. People making uninformed comments like this clearly have no idea what they are talking about. There are very few similarities between ICE engines and electric drivetrains so Tesla is a far ahead leader that also happens to be the most well capitalized auto company. It’s pretty unlikely that the traditional auto makers will “catch up” any time soon.
2021-04-20 16:12:31,wallstreetbets,"Lol,  be careful.  You're on wsb, you may upset the Nokia and blackberry people.  :]"
2021-04-20 12:10:25,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I think NYC, Boston, Philly, and maybe Chicago are some of the few prime candidates for extensive public transit to be an improvement for the average person. But the notion that most cities across the country should be connected by some magical public transit system isn’t remotely realistic. We’re too spread out for that."
2021-04-20 15:37:05,wallstreetbets,I don't know what your rant has to do with city planning of the EU. I told you that the EU is no better off and that the historic shit is in the way of traffic and city planning much more so. I'm not saying you are wrong about the US you keep ranting about. I told you how wrong you are about the EU.
2021-04-20 11:55:23,wallstreetbets,"Bro stop trying you are talking to retards that don’t even know what level 2,3,4,5 is in autonomy. Don’t bother."
2021-04-20 12:52:31,wallstreetbets,"This is a waste of time, you’re clearly not comprehending this. Idc if you want to remain misinformed."
2021-04-20 11:14:18,wallstreetbets,"There’s videos of FSD Beta driving at level 4 all over YouTube (these are some recent ones):

https://youtu.be/rKG3eDppzm4

You can have your opinion but factually you’re incorrect. Until the Beta bugs are worked out you could claim it’s “only” Level 3, but driver oversight is primarily for liability protection since Tesla wouldn’t want to absolve the driver of responsibility until they have their Tesla Insurance product rolled out. 

Given that the beta is already in the hands of thousands of drivers, we’re likely months away from a broad roll-out of FSD. Perhaps robo-taxis in certain areas within the next couple years. Already Tesla could just geo-fence their vehicles to certain areas like Waymo does and it would drive just as well if not better."
2021-04-20 10:15:15,wallstreetbets,very long way of saying no
2021-04-20 15:32:39,wallstreetbets,Dude be careful with that edgy thinking. Being an anti-social edgy kid isn't making you any smarter.

2021-04-20 10:30:54,wallstreetbets,"Actually i remember that tesla publishes accident report with and without autopilot which says with autopilot it is per 1 million miles and without its in 4 million miles or so. But then again thats not a correct study to refer to. Both systems involve in very different problems. A stationary vehicle is involved in lesser number of accidents.that doesnt mean thats the most safe one. 

But boy you showed me!!!! Congrats."
2021-04-20 15:58:23,wallstreetbets,"Lmfao me saying Tesla isn’t a status symbol and you saying it is a status symbol isn’t any different, you hypocritical, stupid fuck. Again, how the fuck does that have anything to do with intelligence? About as much as you have to do with intelligence: nothing"

2021-04-20 10:07:51,wallstreetbets,Big volume in the first 30 minutes of today. Shaping up to be an interesting day.
2021-04-20 10:12:31,wallstreetbets,Went very long on this stock about a month ago.  $MVIS BABY LETS GO.
2021-04-20 10:34:11,wallstreetbets,This is the Mavis Way
2021-04-20 10:49:42,wallstreetbets,Yooooo
2021-04-20 11:14:08,wallstreetbets,Wow! Such diversity.
2021-04-20 11:45:27,wallstreetbets,I grabbed some contracts on both sides.  Nothing like losing an impossible bet...smooov brained
2021-04-20 12:20:50,wallstreetbets,Please forgive my dear aunt Mavis.
2021-04-20 13:02:04,wallstreetbets,2700 at 10.82!
2021-04-20 13:20:24,wallstreetbets,I bought some calls on this but had cash and exercised it for like $5 just to spite the seller.
2021-04-20 14:46:55,wallstreetbets,"20k ready to throw at this

shares or calls? if calls, strike/date?"
2021-04-20 15:49:51,wallstreetbets,Now this is a yolo

2021-04-20 19:16:32,wallstreetbets,MVIS next major announcement will be sharks with lazers!
2021-04-20 19:30:03,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-04-20 10:31:51,wallstreetbets,"Listen, I know RH looks cool and all, but you're putting quite a bit of money in jeopardy if they fold as a company."
2021-04-20 03:45:50,wallstreetbets,"But why? MVIS is a shitty company with like 60 employees and minimal chances at a breakout product. Lot's of baseless conspiracy theories and wishful thinking by some folks, however. I would consider a different stock :)"
2021-04-20 07:10:06,wallstreetbets,Ur gonna lose half ur shit
2021-04-20 07:18:41,wallstreetbets,Man I fuckin love seeing people putting 100k in a bogus stock for inter points! Here's to you being homeless in 3 bud!
2021-04-20 08:20:07,wallstreetbets,Lol I love when people are like “this subs about making money” when clearly it’s not
2021-04-20 08:22:54,wallstreetbets,"HAHAHA YOUR TITLE.  


Picked up 1k shares in premarket....I'm having a hell of a week with this, + ASO + CLOV"
2021-04-20 07:42:55,wallstreetbets,The fact that Cramer is talking about it means it’s gong to moon
2021-04-20 10:38:32,wallstreetbets,Is $MVIS worth getting in? Like is the backing there for it to go back up?
2021-04-20 10:15:06,wallstreetbets,just got in. I Should have waited like 30 seconds to get it at a better deal but all good tho.
2021-04-20 14:04:26,wallstreetbets,In for 150 shares
2021-04-20 12:18:59,wallstreetbets,Fantastic! I have it at $13 and that’s a steal imo
2021-04-20 12:00:23,wallstreetbets,👌
2021-04-20 19:29:01,wallstreetbets,Hell yea thats good
2021-04-20 15:32:10,wallstreetbets,It’s what I used to hedge my balls
2021-04-20 08:34:26,wallstreetbets,Been in at 14 w/no funds left to average down.  Come pick me up!!
2021-04-20 06:10:58,wallstreetbets,Don’t worry I thought that was a great price 3 weeks ago. Shows how quickly things can change
2021-04-20 12:07:20,wallstreetbets,$7 here. Not saying how many shares. Buying an island soon doh.
2021-04-20 09:21:45,wallstreetbets,"Godspeed my friend, I joined the party at around 17 and a half"
2021-04-20 12:12:47,wallstreetbets,"Just bought in at $10.50.

About to buy more."
2021-04-20 14:07:20,wallstreetbets,I went all in in Feb with cost of 16. I’ve been jealous for MONTHS now since it’s gone down to 10-11 three separate times
2021-04-20 08:40:59,wallstreetbets,Same haha
2021-04-20 13:40:07,wallstreetbets,I bought for $22 back in 2008. STILL HOLDING! 💎🙌
2021-04-20 11:58:10,wallstreetbets,just wait a few days and it will be even lower!
2021-04-20 15:12:41,wallstreetbets,"Not dumb, no one knew at the time. Just hold."
2021-04-20 13:21:11,wallstreetbets,"Same.... and just like u/gr8_gr8_grandpappy, I have no more available funds right now to average down... lol"
2021-04-20 09:45:59,wallstreetbets,"in since .74, averaging up, up to 218k shares....to the moon or a tent"
2021-04-20 12:32:03,wallstreetbets,I'm a smooth brained noob but I picked 98@10.50 today. What happens to a stock when the company gets bought out?
2021-04-20 03:33:04,wallstreetbets,Jesus fucking christ
2021-04-20 03:17:27,wallstreetbets,If u buy higher last price not wash sale
2021-04-20 14:54:46,wallstreetbets,There's no buyout! Never have never been. Its just to hype up the stock.
2021-04-20 14:08:32,wallstreetbets,End of week is a stretch. Safely i would say by 5/6 for their q1 sync. PR for this stock always spikes it’s 50+%
2021-04-20 09:25:36,wallstreetbets,Delusional
2021-04-20 12:34:32,wallstreetbets,Also 3) There's talk of selling to someone bigger.
2021-04-20 06:49:59,wallstreetbets,F
2021-04-20 06:43:01,wallstreetbets,With tiny penis
2021-04-20 03:48:07,wallstreetbets,"Jim Cramer said „no“, so yes, it will go up"
2021-04-20 04:07:43,wallstreetbets,It will squeeeeeeze!
2021-04-20 14:14:10,wallstreetbets,"In all seriousness, i don’t listen to that squeeze nonsense. Important things to watch for

-this company is going to demo their highly anticipated LiDAR by end of this month. Any PR from this will spike the price 50% like it has in the past

-this company has their next scheduled PR on 5/6, historically this spikes the price 30-40% as well

-buyout rumors are running rampant. For every 1bn they get bought out for, pps will be $6.5*eachBillion. However there is NO deadline for this. The assuring fact is the CEO has said in the past and on their last earnings call that they are specifically searching for buyout candidates and they are “profoundly optimistic”"
2021-04-20 06:40:35,wallstreetbets,Lasers are cool. MVIS makes lasers
2021-04-20 10:02:24,wallstreetbets,"MVIS has best in class lidar which will be revealed or sold within the end of this month, MVIS has spent the last 3 months hiring personnel (all former Google execs) for what looks like a buy out restructure and a shift towards EV, and then we have the massive shorts. This stock is primed to go and we only have this month really to get it at this price. Before the market crash it was sitting solid"
2021-04-20 14:16:13,wallstreetbets,"Copy pasted from my other comment. The current price of $10 is a fucking steal, i would buy more if i wasn’t already all in at $16

 Important things to watch for

-this company is going to demo their highly anticipated LiDAR by end of this month. Any PR from this will spike the price 50% like it has in the past

2021-04-20 12:33:46,wallstreetbets,Mmm.. that average cost.
2021-04-20 11:31:11,wallstreetbets,"Could potentially shoot up within the next couple of days or tomorrow potentially, but who knows for fucks sakes with any stock poster here at this point."
2021-04-20 12:46:27,wallstreetbets,"yes because MVIS is doing their Lidar A sample demo sometime in april aka any day now. once that happens the price should shoot to 45-50, might pullback, but the company is gonna get bought out for 80-150+ this year, could be as soon as a couple months. Shareholder meeting in may. they're barely talking it's all secret probably talking buyout deals at this very moment. go listen to the ceo talk at the last earnings call, and the mvis reddit. PROFOUNDLY OPTIMISTIC"
2021-04-20 12:59:28,wallstreetbets,Same at 10.50
2021-04-20 16:45:46,wallstreetbets,Just placed a market order to buy 25 on opening. Hopefully I'll get in at around $10 as well.
2021-04-20 11:30:21,wallstreetbets,"Hell no, I’m looking for a multibagger"
2021-04-20 11:11:45,wallstreetbets,It's Mavis. You will have more buying opportunities till PR hits
2021-04-20 03:31:26,wallstreetbets,"There will never be another gme, but it is hot right now I'd estimate 20% or so over the next couple of days. Either that or it will just explode tomorrow. I just enjoy watching tbh I take small gains over long periods of time, I don't go for big wins"
2021-04-20 04:14:39,wallstreetbets,"At some point your portfolio is large enough and risk tolerance fucked enough that you’ll yolo 1 mill. But of course, usually it is backed by loads of DD."
2021-04-20 09:42:16,wallstreetbets,means a discount later today :)
2021-04-20 12:04:22,wallstreetbets,So no go? Or keep holding?
2021-04-20 14:51:47,wallstreetbets,"Elon might hate it, but it's probably going to be required for true autonomous."
2021-04-20 18:44:52,wallstreetbets,"Who gives a fuck what elon musk likes. Jesus christ, people act like he runs the world."
2021-04-20 13:14:09,wallstreetbets,"Unsurprised, yet disappointed 🥲 the play was never about a short squeeze anyways"
2021-04-20 18:38:04,wallstreetbets,"I’m waiting for the next PR or buyout. Until then, I’m holding."
2021-04-20 13:59:57,wallstreetbets,You’re giving him too much credit.
2021-04-20 05:02:05,wallstreetbets,This is so cringe. We don’t nearly have enough money to impact it.
2021-04-20 05:34:33,wallstreetbets,"I keep seeing 'Reddit Army' being used to indicate some sort of coordinated action, mostly on other message boards. Where does that come from? That's not a thing, is it?"
2021-04-20 18:43:25,wallstreetbets,Thieves & scumbags.
2021-04-20 14:50:20,wallstreetbets,Wait for the PR brah
2021-04-20 16:26:13,wallstreetbets,"Not quite yet, like a good barrell of cab still needs some nice redder colour 🍷"
2021-04-20 10:39:26,wallstreetbets,🥲
2021-04-20 14:49:30,wallstreetbets,PR should be dropping this month or early next on a completed A-Sample of Lidar. Buyout talks hopefully happening now. Hard to say. Leaps if you can I guess. I'm personally in at 950 shares and looking to add.
2021-04-20 10:36:59,wallstreetbets,"Do you know this for a fact and know something I don’t about their FINRA insurance coverage, or are you just echoing what WSB GME retards who don’t understand brokerage liquidity have been repeating?"
2021-04-20 03:48:44,wallstreetbets,"I would make fun of you, but I’d like to examine the mind of a retard. How do you base your accusations? Are you aware that the $22B IVAS contract Microsoft secured with the Army is based on MVIS work? Have you looked at their LIDAR specs? Do your parents hate you?"
2021-04-20 03:55:49,wallstreetbets,"Lol ok... MVIS is the engine behind hololens and is the only reason the army will be able to see through walls. But sure, pop off..."
2021-04-20 05:06:31,wallstreetbets,"I mean GME is a shitty brick and mortar store that doesnt really sell anything you can't get from amazon. That hasn't changed in the last 6 months.

The fact is, it doesn't matter. The market is psychology, not logic. Perceptions change, in the blink of an eye."
2021-04-20 07:46:00,wallstreetbets,!remindme 1 month
2021-04-20 09:19:31,wallstreetbets,What’s it about
2021-04-20 12:04:01,wallstreetbets,Why do you think that? Serious question.
2021-04-20 11:15:36,wallstreetbets,What's ASO?
2021-04-20 10:11:20,wallstreetbets,GONG  🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
2021-04-20 12:09:54,wallstreetbets,He wants people to stay away.. so... I should deplete my savings for MVIS?
2021-04-20 12:11:30,wallstreetbets,"According to some retards, MVIS tech is what makes the hololens 2 so great. Military just ordered up a some $billions worth of them from microsoft.. so, MVIS is going to the moon because military. Also, shithead hedgies have been shorting it, fuck the hedgies.

I'm in."
2021-04-20 12:39:08,wallstreetbets,Yes
2021-04-20 13:54:06,wallstreetbets,"Same. Someday I'll learn to just buy 1 share and watch the price plummet, and then buy in for real."
2021-04-20 12:21:39,wallstreetbets,🤞🏻🤞🏻🤞🏻🤞🏻🤞🏻
2021-04-20 11:41:43,wallstreetbets,I bought at $20. Been going peachy so far. Holding on and see you guys on the other side!
2021-04-20 15:38:35,wallstreetbets,You make me feel a lot better At $11
2021-04-20 12:17:20,wallstreetbets,"Same, averaged down to $13. Still a great price imo. It’ll pop here soon if the next pr goes well"
2021-04-20 14:09:29,wallstreetbets,218k shares? Holy moly you could already moderately retire at the current low price. You goin for that retardely rich price aren’t ya
2021-04-20 12:40:41,wallstreetbets,"your shares will just be converted to cash in your account and shares would disappear. so you don't even need to sell ever. what could happen is, you hear news saying mvis is getting bought out right, and the price will shoot way up near the BO price... but if you sell, you'd miss out on potential BIDDING WARS. That could take... who knows, month or so to playout before the deal finally closes. check out the linkedin buyout with microsoft vs salesforce, salesforce made microsoft pay big time by driving the price up. Some companies will want to hurt whoever wants mvis cause they're all competitors so people could bid just to hurt other company's"
2021-04-20 11:54:04,wallstreetbets,"Well, technically that would be his right hand, correct?"
2021-04-20 04:46:18,wallstreetbets,My thoughts exactly
2021-04-20 07:43:08,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-04-20 09:42:49,wallstreetbets,Why?
2021-04-20 06:50:39,wallstreetbets,I should've yolo'd
2021-04-20 08:59:52,wallstreetbets,Tiny but soon to be rich AF penis
2021-04-20 04:52:47,wallstreetbets,"Genuinely speaking, do you think so? I’m down bad and need to rely on a meme stock 😩"
2021-04-20 06:46:35,wallstreetbets,🤨
2021-04-20 13:37:21,wallstreetbets,I'm hoping a few days so I can buy some cheap calls when my funds clear hahaha
2021-04-20 14:20:31,wallstreetbets,"The data you suggest is correct but the numbers are wildly off based.

A-Sample news can take it back to $20 range but absolutely not 45-50, you’re dreaming. The buyout pps of 80-150 means the company is being bought out for 13-20billion which is also very very optimistic. I’m literally all in on it but let’s not get spread misinformation"
2021-04-20 11:31:43,wallstreetbets,you're gonna be holding multiple bags that's for sure.
2021-04-20 06:57:04,wallstreetbets,I’m expecting a 100% move next time it takes off
2021-04-20 04:33:21,wallstreetbets,There will be another gme. Maybe not for the reasons gme rocketed but......there will be another one. Fuck knows when.
2021-04-20 14:46:19,wallstreetbets,how low could it go though
2021-04-20 14:51:19,wallstreetbets,"You'll be good bro. Just hold. The news hasn't even dropped, and you see how this bitch pops off even on the most mundane of news. I'm in it with you."
2021-04-20 13:22:38,wallstreetbets,Target price to liquidate?
2021-04-20 13:15:24,wallstreetbets,So I assume you’re holding?
2021-04-20 06:03:00,wallstreetbets,"These tards think r/WSB acts cohesively and has enough traders working ‘together’ to mean anything. I bet 7,000,000 of the subscribers here don’t even trade and are just in from the GME hype"
2021-04-20 05:13:57,wallstreetbets,"We do have enough money to impact it.

The odds are that we will not, though. I look at it like this - there's millions of us all in here throwing shit and eating crayons from the 200ct boxes. You want everyone to eat the dark forest green one at the same time? Good fucking luck."
2021-04-20 06:25:48,wallstreetbets,"Reddit Army has nothing to do with WSB. It referred to the large amount of Redditors that would follow a link,  crashing websites that couldn't handle the traffic."
2021-04-20 05:37:16,wallstreetbets,"It’s not. It’s seriously something cringe as fuck. This place is about making, and losing money with options. That’s it. This isn’t some movement to take down hedge funds. If anything we want to do blow with them."
2021-04-20 14:56:54,wallstreetbets,"i can afford the leaps, im looking at 1/22. willing to yolo it all on calls at the moment

im trying to time this but that’s impossible"
2021-04-20 13:17:39,wallstreetbets,I think you're only covered for 250k
2021-04-20 04:13:30,wallstreetbets,He didn’t do dd . Total ape
2021-04-20 04:36:22,wallstreetbets,“the only reason the army will be able to see through walls” 😂😂😂
2021-04-20 04:01:17,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, such cutting-edge technology. They must be giving it away for free given the plummeting revenues and all. What a lovely charitable organization. Tomorrow all-in on puts."

2021-04-20 18:34:13,wallstreetbets,Don’t forget the automotive LIDAR sample coming out this month 👍🏻
2021-04-20 14:17:12,wallstreetbets,Would it not be priced in since it’s historical?
2021-04-20 19:03:54,wallstreetbets,Same
2021-04-20 12:45:14,wallstreetbets,I ended up buying 25 @ $10.53
2021-04-20 14:02:30,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-04-20 14:16:42,wallstreetbets,"I had 320k at one point and sold a bunch in the high teens and low twenties to fund other investments, there are a few wrinkles on my brain. I just can't help buying more at these stupid low prices."
2021-04-20 15:00:51,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for explaining, that all makes sense."
2021-04-20 08:06:18,wallstreetbets,"Wash sale adjustment occurs when you buy and sell a stock at a loss, and then buy back in to the same stock, or a similar stock in the same industry, at a lower price in less than 30 days. You will carry the cost of the wash sale in your average share price until you eventually sell your position."
2021-04-20 13:56:24,wallstreetbets,Pretty sure already rich af
2021-04-20 04:59:28,wallstreetbets,"It‘s not a meme stock in my eyes, there is true value behind this company and their products. Executive board knows exactly what they are doing. As im in long, I personally have no doubt that this is still a monster stock"
2021-04-20 07:23:59,wallstreetbets,yh expecting a buyout this year
2021-04-20 05:02:43,wallstreetbets,"Real talk, yes."
2021-04-20 10:17:33,wallstreetbets,Definitely not a meme stock. Proper company with proper big moves coming...
2021-04-20 07:57:34,wallstreetbets,Tell me I’m wrong
2021-04-20 12:18:43,wallstreetbets,Not sure if that’s an insult or a compliment lmao
2021-04-20 04:46:35,wallstreetbets,"He is definitely an ape because he don't know when Kodak went up 3000%+ in 2 days , I remember doing the calculations and I think it was like a 3500x+ bagger on the options , 1k to 3.5M which is more than what GME can ever give you."
2021-04-20 05:15:20,wallstreetbets,We do not have enough money. They have a $1.6B market cap.
2021-04-20 09:06:18,wallstreetbets,I’m buying calls on $BLOW

2021-04-20 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"My fellow PLTR apes should know the risks I love PLTR stock, I bought at DPO and sold half at 40 (where the valuation was just getting too dumb for a stock with 30-40% growth - I am planning to buy again when it declines more). 

The company is great and I can tell you first hand that they only hire the brightest to work there. 

But I want to teach you apes (the ones who want to hold this for 4-5 years) about valuation. Let’s do a an experiment, I assume that PLTR blows their prediction of 30% growth in the next 4 years and grows by 40% (that will be very hard to accomplish so this is a very bullish 33% average beat). 

We have a revenue of 1.1 billion for 2020, have that grow for 4 years by 40% (1.1*1.40^4 =4.2). That results into a revenue of 4.2 billion. When I use a PS multiple I assume they improve their margins and are not considered a consulting business- that would be disastrous for the stock - therefore, I am still very bullish. Splunk - which is a worse competitor has had an average 5 year PS of 10. If we apply a price to sales of 10 we are trading today at a 2024 PS ratio of 10! If we take an extra bullish view (we can apply a PS of 15 - which quite curiously appears in a lot of VC late stage funding valuations); with a 15 PS we have a 63 billion valuation which implies a 50% growth from here in 4 years. Which is insane especially since I took into consideration extra growth.

I know most of you 🦍 like to gamble but if you plan to hold this for 10 years this is a great pick, but don’t be surprised if in 4 years you’re up only 50%. Moreover, for those of you who like to gamble please learn to find run ups to catalysts and improve your chances of succeeding (if you want me to delve deeper into that leave a comment - there are surprising methods to the madness). ✌️"

2021-04-20 04:17:03,wallstreetbets,"How anyone thinks PLTR will randomly spike is beyond me. It's a great company fighting to make their first Q1 profits, of course they are in the red.

2021-04-20 02:11:53,wallstreetbets,PLTR loves the color red
2021-04-20 07:21:25,wallstreetbets,"You're neglecting the fact that they just entered the commercial market recently, have been investing heavily in sales and marketing with multiple demo events to capture more and more interest from companies. As big data is becoming more and more prevalent and PLTR's products are, evidently and confirmed even by the military, best-in-class, this provides a huge potential going forward. I think their financial estimations were somewhat on the conservative side, given the uncertainty of the pandemic, but with the products that they have, it would be fairly easy to land some huge contracts with the biggest companies or even governmental organizations.

It's hard to valuate companies with disruptive technologies using the traditional methods of valuation. For a fundamentals investor, it brings peace of mind when you have some kind of certainty looking at black and white numbers. But for a risk tolerant investor, PLTR is a great play with proven track records, huge upside potentials and a good net to fall back on if things don't work out."
2021-04-20 07:44:37,wallstreetbets,Thx for your DD. Why do you think the PE ratio will decrease with constant growth? I think that doesn't make sense.

2021-04-20 10:53:23,wallstreetbets,"it is a growth software stock. You can't measure the value based on just P/s . These kinds of stocks just need momentum. if momentum comes again, you will see pltr fly again. 

But a lot of stock analyst who does not know anything software, they just measure stock value like you. That is wrong.  And they just went to public 7 months ago.  

After a couple of earnings and done the insider selling, this company has a great future. Their foundry product is a kinda monopoly for the IT industry.  If their growth would be %400, you can see the triple digits very easily."

2021-04-20 19:02:50,wallstreetbets,PLTR dealt with a lot of bad publicity for working with ICE when orange man was in office. Now that he have forget ball jones in office the negative publicity has subsided. Analysts will soon start raising their price targets and this stock will moon but patience is the key. They haven't even started scratching the surface on the commercial business and growth estimates are very conservative. See you on the moon bois...

With trading, you look at it every day, dont care much about fundamentals and buy at the valleys and sell at the peaks, aka technicals etc. It seems you are confused about what to do with PLTR lol."

2021-04-20 19:28:14,wallstreetbets,The market is irrational but saying PLTR is undervalued is like saying TSLA is undervalued.
2021-04-20 09:04:10,wallstreetbets,This guy fucks.
2021-04-20 04:09:00,wallstreetbets,Yes because you were holding palantir and just now benihana123 convinced you to sell with all the facts and his crystal ball. Sure bro.
2021-04-20 06:59:20,wallstreetbets,"You cannot time or expect these swings to happen that would be dumb. And for your interest, TSLA has a PS ratio of 24 and a targeted growth by Musk of 50%. The max PS ratio that TSLA had in the last 5 years was 30. So, yeah - some really sad folks bought PLTR at like 45 USD with an insane PS of 80 - that is insane especially when this isn’t a company that grows its revenues by 100% every year."

2021-04-20 13:24:53,wallstreetbets,Putting it at 40-50 and I bought at 32 6 months ago. So I am holding for two years to break even. That's a quality stock that definitely deserves all this attention.

2021-04-20 04:02:23,wallstreetbets,I'm more interested in Q4 earnings or next year earnings because Karp said he is giving US & global businesses free data yesterday which means more customers soon.
2021-04-20 08:01:27,wallstreetbets,"There are so many things wrong with your assumptions. Firstly, if revenue should increase by 400% (1 billion to 4 billion) over next 4 years, why price should only increase by 50% over the same period? Secondly, you are not taking into account that SW companies do very well during high inflation period, as they have very minimum PPI increase but they can still pass the cost to the customer. Thirdly, big data firms will have a huge customer base increase as firms will look for ways to reduce their costs as inflation will increase in coming years.

I am not saying PLTR will increase their market cap by 400%, but they will definetly beat their earnings estimate of 4 years"
2021-04-20 10:57:03,wallstreetbets,If it helps get the message across. 😜

2021-04-20 07:16:36,wallstreetbets,"I think basic critical thinking tells you that 22.5 is half of 45, and if it had a PS of 80 at 45, at 22.5 it would have a PS of 40 which is still more NOW than TSLA ever was... I was just amused by how stupid (not in the kind retarded way) some people can be."
2021-04-20 08:48:14,wallstreetbets,">if revenue should increase by 400% (1 billion to 4 billion) over next 4 years, why price should only increase by 50% over the same period?
>

Because he thinks they're currently over valued..."
2021-04-20 07:22:17,wallstreetbets,I agree. I also wonder who stupid people can be. Good bye. Troll.
2021-04-20 10:35:57,wallstreetbets,"Myself, I think the incremental cost of increasing revenues will drop to near-zero, essentially meaning at some point their additional revenues will equal their pre-tax profit. So if I expect this growth to continue for 10 years+, then in four years, at $4B, I am looking forward to the next 4 years being at say $16B (I actually think they can be much higher then that), with perhaps $10B+ in profits. And they would still be a growth company at that point. So multiply the profits by easily 30X and in 8 years you get a $300B company.

Whatever, I am just throwing out numbers here without doing much work, but there are reasons why many are willing to place a high value on them. Their software is also seemingly so much ahead of any competing options and unless something changes should be just about guaranteed to gain market share and see revenues continue to explode. You really have no choice but to use their software, as once your competitors pick it up, you will be at a competitive disadvantage without it. Kind of like trying to do inter-state deliveries with horse and wagon when your competitors are using Class 8 trucks."

2021-04-20 05:34:35,wallstreetbets,"Bullish. 

Every time something bad happens it makes the news. You don’t see that with other companies because it happens so often. 

Tesla makes the news every time because of

A: Media loves drawing attention to what everyone knows (like Tesla within the last year) and 

B: Tesla fails so infrequent that it’s headline worthy when they fail catastrophically."
2021-04-20 09:04:33,wallstreetbets,"So let me get this straight

“Herman also reportedly said that evidence including witness statements clearly indicated there was nobody in the driver's seat of the Model S when it crashed into a tree and burst into flames”.

So despite the fact that Tesla has stated, multiple times that someone must be behind the wheel at all times, and that the car should not be driving without anyone inside it and behind the wheel, Tesla is to blame?

Hahaha yeah ok retard.

2021-04-20 13:56:49,wallstreetbets,The Tesla won’t even engage in autopilot if there isn’t a weight on the seat. It’s a safety feature. What most likely happened is they crashed without a seatbelt on and got flung into the back

2021-04-20 02:11:08,wallstreetbets,"People are stupid.  Back in the **1980s** in the prairies when my family was shopping for a camper we went to one dealer and there was a completely wrecked motorhome in the back of the lot.  My dad asked the salesman what the deal with that was and he said some guy bought it and was going on the highway and engaged the cruise control then walked into the back to make a sandwich.  It being the prairies and a new (at the time) motorhome it had excellent wheel alignment and actually held course on the perfectly flat road for a couple minutes until the first curve came up.  The road went left, and the motorhome went off the road into a farmer's field and fell into a dry ditch.  Guy was lucky he wasn't killed but insisted it was the motorhome's fault because the ""autopilot"" failed.  

Idiots everywhere."
2021-04-20 12:58:22,wallstreetbets,"I will say we are poor at accessing risks, especially of a black box like the Tesla. You ride with this thing not making a mistake for a month in what appears to be the exact same situation every day, your not going to expect it to change. But what you don't know/(are not told) is how many times the system had some failure or close call. IE you could be having lost satellites and GPS, and road marking 15 times on this straight but those 3 loses just haven't ever all 3 over lapped for long enough yet.  So if you failed to the last line of safety 100 times in that same stretch every day, only tesla can know that. The driver has no way of knowing how close the system came to failure, and how those 5 satellites normally seen overhead maybe only 2 are visible today due to different conditions. Yet through constant exposure most Tesla owners will begin to think of them selves as the experts in the system. Of course it doesn't help when you have Musk saying it is safer than a normal driver.  If you are constantly told it is safer than your own abilities, why wouldn't you decide that is an acceptable risk?"

2021-04-20 18:39:46,wallstreetbets,"All the down votes from people who don't understand electrical fires, chemical fire vs petrol fires.

Battery electrolyte doesn't burn as easily on it's own. And a runaway battery is a completely different fire to a petrol fire.

Battery electrolyte found in your typical lithium battery is very often in a gell form these days. They are not your grandpas led acid car batteries filled with diluted hydrochloric acid.  Even then, you can't set fire to hydrochloric acid.

Petroleum fires will spread much easily as you can light the fuel spilling out. You CAN NOT set fire to electrolyte on it's own as easily at petrol. It requires both parts of the battery to do it's thing. And when it does, it's a chemical fire not a petrol fire. Different fire fighting rules apply."
2021-04-20 12:20:12,wallstreetbets,"I think you are mistaking energy storage with combustable energy. In your scenario, a full discharged battery cannot catch on fire. If I crack open my discharged lithium battery, the lithium is still highly oxidizable.  [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950423016304715](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950423016304715) shows this nicely. Might be paywalled as I work at a university. Basically 50% discharged has the same heat energy release as 100% showing it is oxidation the electrolytes that kills you. The FAA has an experiment that shows energy loss as a function of charge. [https://www.fire.tc.faa.gov/pdf/TC-15-40.pdf](https://www.fire.tc.faa.gov/pdf/TC-15-40.pdf) However, they purged the chamber with nitrogen to ensure that oxidation does not occur. Together, these experiments show that the oxidation of the materials is what drives total thermal release. The risk of initial failure scales with the charge (discharged batteries are not going to have thermal runaway). However, once you have thermal runaway in any oxygen and water environment, you have a energy release that scales with the size of the battery."

More and MORE FUD across all platforms. The only real argument is that we don’t have a working product that anyone has seen and very little revenue.

2021-04-19 23:00:38,wallstreetbets,"The ""Gigantic Short Position"" Cramer is talking about... 

https://imgur.com/a/SloplAX

It's approximately 19.42% of the float today, 21.07% on Friday with 33M out of 157M shares available...

Someone is banking that the company doesn't complete, or even updated shareholders on their solid state MEMS based [long range lidar](https://youtu.be/XwiI1-rSgq0) which is based off of the [light engine which can be found in the Hololens 2](https://charts.stocktwits.com/production/original_318277355.jpg). 

That same light engine that allows Microsoft to reach the unheard of [80degx40deg](https://preview.redd.it/hzfka1myslr61.png?width=1024&auto=webp&s=4fe042837ace63723d47fbf3ca876de5588149f7) Field of View in their IVAS (Integrated Visual Augmentation Headsets) which recently won a [$21.88 Billion dollar contract](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/31/microsoft-wins-contract-to-make-modified-hololens-for-us-army.html) from the US Army, for the next 10 years.

The entire LIDAR sector has seen a focused short attack, but the one difference is that Microvision is seeing an unusual amount of darkpool activity as seen on [stockgrid.io](https://www.stockgrid.io/darkpools/MVIS) which is showing a $309M dollar buy-side imbalance from the last 20 days. 

The shorts Cramer was talking about was also [Hindenberg Research](https://twitter.com/HindenburgRes/status/1341403669162565638) which shorted the stock at $9... where it dropped to $5 then squeezed up to $24. 

I even made a video meme back in January while it was being shorted as Hindenberg has their shitty patent lawyer try to shit talk Microvision's 480+ patents which they've accumulated over the past 20 years in business... only to delete all his tweets on twitter.

[Hindenberg's Downfall](https://streamable.com/elfn5o)

Good luck to all longs... I didn't hear no fucking bell Cramer, [although it's the second time this idiot's talked about Microvision](https://v.redd.it/q5dwloh4kvg61)... my guess is he actually shorted MVIS back in December and got burned lol."

For all you MVIS newbies, the reason you should hold is that the company has a big announcement coming soon. It has been stated several times that it will come in April.

2021-04-20 06:34:17,wallstreetbets,"One argument I keep seeing is that the stock already ran 4000% or whatever over a year. This company was struggling during Covid with product partners pulling out of deals. They have been spending money developing their best-in-class lidar over several years. The company was and still is being shorted into the ground for not having much revenue.

The same shit was being pulled with GME, except because MVIS is a smaller company, shorts could really go to town and drag the share price into the dirt. The share price last year was NOT indicative whatsoever of the value of this company.

Their lidar technology is ahead of any other lidar manufacturer (and yet MVIS has the lowest market cap), their technology is in Hololens2 (\~$22billion army deal) and they have a fuck ton of patents (AR/VR & AV). Microsoft, Google, Apple, Facebook, they all need their tech and MVIS is up for sale.

The real value of MVIS is signifcantly higher than the current share price indicates and MVIS is ready this year to show what they got. Shorts better get out or they will get burnt hard.

TLDR: Fuck shorts man."

2021-04-20 01:42:55,wallstreetbets,"For y'all just hearing about MVIS theyre supposed to be bought out any time now after their april demo by a big company (AAPL, GOOGL, MSFT) If they are bought out for their LIDAR, they will have a huge contirbution to self driving cars and will be invaluable to the company that did buy them out. We have never had more of a need for LIDAR technology for self driving cars then now. $MVIS"
2021-04-20 01:57:43,wallstreetbets,"Fuck it, going to do $25K tomorrow on $MVIS who is with me!?"
2021-04-19 23:43:50,wallstreetbets,"I bought right at the top of this @23.27.
You guys are coming back for me right?
Guys?"
2021-04-19 23:36:22,wallstreetbets,Ive been in! I like the stock!
2021-04-20 00:11:29,wallstreetbets,"Been long in MVIS for almost a year now, and there's been lots of ups and downs.  The shorts have really battered the stock at different points but the company's fundamentals are strong and the risk, IMO is low.  They're on a massive hiring spree (ramping up for big things), they have capital to last, and they have a BEST IN CLASS lidar module that will be available for purchase in Q3 or Q4, beating other Lidar competitors to market.

Do your own due diligence, and when you do, you'll have real FOMO.  My personal non professional opinion is this is the last chance to get in this low.

*Edit - I also YOLO'd today dropping a lot of money (for me) on MVIS to increase my position in preparation for the squeeze/news.  Strong believer here"
2021-04-20 03:33:39,wallstreetbets,"I've thought about going in on MVIS but held back. He said don't, so that makes it clear I should."
2021-04-20 06:22:16,wallstreetbets,He said the same thing about TSLA and GME before the SS. This thing is gonna 🚀🚀

 He also said the same thing about Tesla In 2017 and you should avoid the battleground : [https://youtu.be/4Ap0Et3OipA](https://youtu.be/4Ap0Et3OipA)

2021-04-20 13:32:50,wallstreetbets,Been in mvis for awhile. A buyout is inevitable hopefully. A buyout + large short position = rocket
2021-04-20 15:25:54,wallstreetbets,"Holding 20.3k shares and some calls not going anywhere. Bought more today actually. Thanks for the dip shorts and paper hands!

18% fee on iborrow and only 80k share left to borrow. Squeeze is coming, a real PR is going to send this 🚀"
2021-04-20 16:41:03,wallstreetbets,Well the shorting fee is now up to 18% from starting yesterday at 9% we need to keep buying and adding pressure on top of skyrocketing fees. Today seeking alpha decides to write a hit piece for MVIS with literally no good points on why it’s bad to go long? This is obvious that they’re teaming up to continue to try to short this. We need to keep pressure on them LFG

2021-04-20 02:49:25,wallstreetbets,"Did my DD on this company a few months ago and loved what I saw (the institutional ownership was the cherry on top). Held my core position through the ups and downs, adding when possible.

55% of my portfolio is already on this rocket ship, what's another 20% tomorrow. Will be adding to my may and june calls also. Fuck cramer and his HF scumbag friends, they've caused enough damage to retail investors over the decades."
2021-04-20 06:24:19,wallstreetbets,"Shorts are vicious on MVIS, I’ve been following the stock for awhile. MVIS is at an inflection point with their technology, they have either finished and sent lidar samples to interested parties or are going to within the next two weeks, and are primed for a short squeeze. This is the time to buy this stock. Not to mention that the company is for sale and they’ve been in talks with “tier 1 gorillas” as to a potential buyout. Lots of accumulation recently via dark pools as well."

2021-04-20 05:37:06,wallstreetbets,"This is actually one of those rare instances where it’s a good stock and there’s an opportunity for a short squeeze. The CEO indicated in March that they are pursuing a buyout or strategic partnership for both their Lidar and AR verticals. Yes, their revenue sucks, and that’s probably why shorts see it as an easy target, but that’s not how the company should be valued. They have best in class Lidar that is going to be available in 2021, not 2023 and beyond. With companies scrambling to dominate the self driving and AR markets, this is an incredible opportunity for a buyout. Combine that with several Google and Ford affiliated execs joining the board in recent months and you can’t help but try to connect the dots. Nothing is certain in this world, but this is a bet I’m willing to make.

2021-04-20 03:35:01,wallstreetbets,"https://www.stockgrid.io/darkpools/MVIS

https://iborrowdesk.com/report/MVIS

https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/MVIS/short-interest/

- Jim Cramer just called it a “BATTLEGROUND STOCK” - last time he did this was with GME right before it went parabolic

- Dark Pool has been buying up $300 MILLION worth of shares for a company with a $1.8 B market cap the past 20 days

- iborrowdesk is showing a 10.3% interest rate to borrow shares to short

- Last short interest pull from MAR31 when MVIS ran up to $18 was at 17%... it’s been getting crushed by shorts the last 11 trading days and estimates are anywhere between 25-35%

- “A-sample completion in April timeframe, looking at buyouts/partnerships” - CEO in last earnings call conference. 

- last time there was a catalyst about the A sample MVIS ran up to $24. On top of the high short interest, this could very well be a violent squeeze when the news drops

- I personally YOLO’D 1.1 million for 96k shares at 11.46 average

WHAT THE HELL ARE YALL WAITING FOR"

2021-04-20 04:31:32,wallstreetbets,Play is the same as GME buy some options and then grab as many shares as you can and horde them until it pops or buyout happens.
2021-04-20 04:46:21,wallstreetbets,I will now use Cramer as my investing mentor and do the opposite of whatever he says.

With rumors of buyout of at least one or more verticals.

This stock has so much short term and long term high percentage growth opportunity potential.. it's a unique and awesome situation to be in. This is a long term hold for me."

MVIS is centered in two incoming $T disruptive industries (AR/VR & AV). Also, MVIS is in the HL2 and more than likely inside MSFT’s IVAS military headset that just generated a $22B 10yr contract with the US gov. Yeah, I’d say he’s slipping a bit!"

I slept a few hours, woke up and sold everything I had except for GME. All my RKT and ASO gone. I YOLOd it all to get to 500 shares of MVIS and averaged down.

2021-04-20 08:37:01,wallstreetbets,Oh yes this is about to get hotter than a junkies spoon.
2021-04-20 08:37:23,wallstreetbets,Less than 2 billion dollar market cap? That’s a bubble bath at the spa for this group.
2021-04-20 08:53:06,wallstreetbets,Now my portfolio will finally have some diversity!!! Am I doing this right?!
2021-04-20 09:27:46,wallstreetbets,Cramer looks like Louis CK on meth....
2021-04-20 09:27:46,wallstreetbets,"For you technical or swing traders, 100SMA tested 3-4 times yesterday but bounced. All indicators show oversold. Techs look good, sentiment looks good, Cramer looks bad, need more info? Click on u/s2upid and read his DD 🚀"
2021-04-20 09:41:18,wallstreetbets,"LET'S FUCKING GO. LAST STOP BEFORE A 3x. Don't sell your GME. Use extra cash you have laying around to buy a little bit of this. GME  to the moon. MVIS too!

2021-04-20 10:59:09,wallstreetbets,I bought 4 shares at open today simply to spite this mindset. :)
2021-04-20 11:15:38,wallstreetbets,I've made money watching Cramer over the years and I've made money reading wallstreetbets as well.  You have to be able to decipher what the good information and bad information is.  Both Cramer and Wallstreet bets gives both great information and terrible information.  When I watch Cramer call this a battleground stock and compare it to the information here that tells me to buy some shares.
2021-04-20 11:54:48,wallstreetbets,Still not selling this shit
2021-04-20 12:24:55,wallstreetbets,He won’t even look the camera in the eyes when he lies

2021-04-20 00:11:53,wallstreetbets,"He said buy........I mean, that was the most wishy washy “there are other stocks out there” ever."

2021-04-19 23:50:49,wallstreetbets,"My formula for success is to do the exact opposite of what Cramer says.

I rolled GME gains into MVIS and am sitting on 6,xxx golden tickets to the buyout."

2021-04-20 00:02:30,wallstreetbets,LFFFGGGGG!!!!
2021-04-20 00:58:57,wallstreetbets,He said stay away from it..... and going reverse Cramer could be a legitimate strategy....

2021-04-20 03:14:58,wallstreetbets,So buy?
2021-04-20 05:02:32,wallstreetbets,"Even without squeeze this could go up 4-5x if a buyout is announced.

The state of Michigan has bought a lot of MVIS before the first rally in February... you might wonder if they had some insider info.."
2021-04-19 22:41:10,wallstreetbets,I like the stock

2021-04-20 06:39:06,wallstreetbets,"The whole thing doesn’t make sense to me. Stock market is partly dependent on the market psychology and the mass, that is, the population. It is also partly dependent on actual events that determine the demand by people. Although people are now equipped with readily accessible information both still affect stock going up and down. This guy, televising the analysis telling people to do or not do things in the market doesn’t make sense to me at all. A bit like your wife’s boyfriend looking for another girl in the town and none is to be found a guy comes along and tells him in broad day light with a mic and a loudspeaker that there is a red light district over yonder and that he should go there although it may give him some STDs."

They could play an uno reversal where literally nobody is shorting it. Or they could be telling the truth and everybody is shorting it. No idea.

All I know is buy GME and hold."
2021-04-20 03:27:56,wallstreetbets,"It looks to me like Cramer is correct about this. The stock flatlined on the 5y chart until the last four months. I would call it a pump and dump, but the action appears to show a price battle continuing. The increase in SI is strange, unless the shorts believe that this stock is too obscure to mount a proper defense. I question the relatively low SI if supposedly shorts are trying to take this ticker down. That leads me to suspect that it is as Cramer said - a stock heavily manipulated by potentially big players who might be working together to trap."

Any other WSB play from Dec-Feb, we had complete control over. 200 upvotes on a decently well written autistic DD $1-5 billion market cap we could pump within a day off a few hundred otm calls.  Now we get 1k upv on an awesome DD and it goes red all week while the market goes green 12 consecutive days.  

Now with overnight repo loan rates at .01% and hedge funds shitting their pants they might go extinct to meme queens like Cathy who charge 1/20th, we don't stand a chance.  These guys are massively overlevered on all retail stocks trying to play catch up.  You guys are buying $GME at $500 a share.  Diamond hands it and you'll succeed but God, there are some ripe plays out there.  


I miss old WSB"

Second time he’s mentioned MVIS since I’ve been holding for the last year and he couldn’t say one thing about our claims of best in class product due to be released?  I hope he gets crushed in this short squeeze.

2021-04-20 00:54:56,wallstreetbets,I am also convinced Jim Cramer is shorting this stock - did you see how quickly he knew how over shorted it was calling it a battleground stock?  Second time he’s mentioned MVIS since I’ve been holding for the last year and he couldn’t say one thing about our claims of best in class product due to be released?  I hope he gets crushed in this short squeeze.
2021-04-20 06:17:01,wallstreetbets,So what you're saying is some tendies should be directed this way in the future to help a good cause.
2021-04-20 07:14:31,wallstreetbets,Well done S2

2021-04-20 01:36:44,wallstreetbets,I wonder what the floor is for their short attacks?  Could they successfully blow this back down into the $5 range?
2021-04-20 08:16:19,wallstreetbets,"I have to say on the fundamentals this company doesn’t look that great. Their earnings have been in the toilet with [revenues decreasing the past few years](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MVIS/financials?p=MVIS). They have no named automotive partners for their automotive LIDAR despite the fact they’ve been talking it up for years (meanwhile, most of the major automakers have paired off with other LIDAR manufacturers). Every year or two they trot out a video of a laser projection touch display, but it seems to be a technology that no one asked for because there hasn’t been a killer app for it."

2021-04-20 01:15:18,wallstreetbets,If we don’t hit $25 I would be shocked. The news about MSFT and IVAS contract pushed it up 50% in an hour. We can move much farther than that.
2021-04-20 00:04:16,wallstreetbets,My first experience was the Daily Show when Jon Stewart called him out for being a dishonest little shit.
2021-04-20 01:34:15,wallstreetbets,It's gonna be there with a buyout regardless. So it may as well be now.

You are a dumb Redditor.

You have 1000 bucks

You think you know more than Cramer 

Any definite stance he takes, you do the opposite.

If he says avoid, buy some shares. Don’t allow any one stock to be worth more than 10 percent of your portfolio. 

That’s all I can think of at the moment unless you want to yolo a grand at the first thing he says no to just to spite him. If you go this route all 100 percent must be in one share at a time and it must be in a stock he hates or says to avoid"

2021-04-20 00:42:32,wallstreetbets,"Heard it before, doesn’t mean it won’t keep pulling back though because it’s still up so much for the year.

2021-04-20 06:54:47,wallstreetbets,"They have terrible record in launching new products. They have been working on laser tech for 20 years! Still no lidar. Leadership doesn't come across as visionary. Heck, the company doesn't come across as having done anything new since the tech bubble burst of 20 years ago. Even their website is uninspirational. There is way too much hype in new Lidar companies with ridiculous mkt cap without a product. 

MVIS went up almost 6k%! With price to sales of almost 800x. Most hardware companies are in single digits. Even apple is only 8x. Not sure where the upside is going to come from. It's not like they have cool marketing team like Luminar to push their PS to 350x without any product.

Automotive grade lidars that meet iso26262 (e.g. ASIL B/D) are no joke. Only a handful are in the mkt that have the designation. It's taken them years to achieve the safety standards. Others are all empty promises at the moment. 

My $0.02, other lidar companies will eat MVIS lunch. Perhaps invest in other more established lidar companies?

I have no position in MVIS. I do know autonomous car tech."
2021-04-20 06:59:50,wallstreetbets,Exactly. Have cool tech doesn't mean that final product works. Lab test and theoretical limits are very different than the performance in the field.
2021-04-20 06:58:40,wallstreetbets,"How? Just like Luminar?

2021-04-20 07:21:15,wallstreetbets,"You just watched a tear down of the Hololens 2, due to NDA’s in place Microsoft has never given credit to microvision publicly for their tech that is the heart of the product. There was no other way to prove it other than S2upid dropping $8000 to buy one himself and rip it apart only to see the MVIS and logo on the scanner. It was a huge moment for us as it gave 100% confirmation that our tech is the main component of Microsoft’s product which is now being sold to the Army for that $22bn contract in the form of IVAS (an upgraded version specified for the battlefield)

Edit: I should add, MVIS has multiple main verticals, this is the AR/VR space but the money maker will be the Lidar tech they created which is the best in class self driving tech that we expect a few of the 80,000lb gorillas will be coming for.

Edit 2: thanks for the awards all"

2021-04-20 07:45:04,wallstreetbets,Thanks for elaborating... Interesting info.
2021-04-20 07:10:43,wallstreetbets,They are actually in the process of field testing it via Ansys which is headed up by one of its board members Judy Curran! She was a former executive at Ford for 32 years and she just joined Microvisions board of directors late last year. According to Sharma the initial tests were a success and beyond the expectations of the interested parties. The lidar is based on the same technology that Microsoft uses in their flagship product (Hololens 2)! That's a real and proven product; they are not a joke!
2021-04-20 07:05:36,wallstreetbets,"Negative! Luminar doesn't hold a candle to Microvision and I'm not even exaggerating. Microvision is capable of over 20 million data points per second whereas Luminar who comes closest is only capable of 10.5 million data points per second. Microvision has waaaay better resolution at short, mid, and especially long range and it's more form fitting for cars. Also, Microvision has the most affordable and scalable lidar on the market and this is ONLY THE LIDAR! This is easily a $20 Billion company which translates to $130/share... It's not fluff man, this is the real deal coming from the CEO himself who was a former executive at Google so he absolutely knows his shit."

2021-04-20 05:53:09,wallstreetbets,"Yes , of course .. Risk Reward is good at CLOV"
2021-04-20 01:07:40,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, most of the OI at $10 is hedge for shorts under $10. They have likely covered by this point. There's still probably 25mil+ shares short, and another 2mil that need to be bought for OI if above $10. 

The shorts under $15 aren't hedged as well, but it's a long ways from $10 to $15. If this slow climbs, they will cover over the next month. Sadly, unless some amazing news comes out, the next catalyst is 5/20, assuming they can get some better margins on premiums to claims. 

Hopefully it hangs around $10 and shorts stay greedy."

2021-04-20 10:14:00,wallstreetbets,">5/20

What's up with this date?"
2021-04-20 18:36:29,wallstreetbets,"They said spce couldn’t go lower, but here we are. $plug same way, going back to $2"
2021-04-20 01:11:42,wallstreetbets,You’ve got it right. MVIS is a sit it and forget it stock. CLOV is a momentum play.

2021-04-20 05:17:38,wallstreetbets,TLRY is already poised to gap-up a dollar on open.
2021-04-20 05:39:38,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-04-20 12:00:40,wallstreetbets,"Well, retail is officially not in charge"
2021-04-20 00:00:27,wallstreetbets,That's my birthday
2021-04-20 02:00:42,wallstreetbets,Because of taco Tuesday? 👀
2021-04-20 04:23:58,wallstreetbets,MMs know it's 4/20 too. They're less stupid than you might think
2021-04-19 23:38:40,wallstreetbets,Yeah but you could say that about anything really
2021-04-20 02:15:57,wallstreetbets,Hold up! Let me buy in first...
2021-04-19 23:47:09,wallstreetbets,My 300 @ $18 fully fuckin agrees
2021-04-20 02:07:15,wallstreetbets,This has nothing to do with trashy apha
2021-04-20 01:33:46,wallstreetbets,Elaborate brother
2021-04-20 07:18:08,wallstreetbets,Gotta get them points baby
2021-04-20 09:20:54,wallstreetbets,Venmo your dealer 😉
2021-04-20 09:27:48,wallstreetbets,"Every time I go to my local dispensary, I forget about this and they re-explain that due to being federally illegal, credit cards won’t accept the charge. So I nod along and pretend to understand while swiping my debit card that represents a credit union exclusively located in a state where weed is illegal (I moved from WI to MA)"
2021-04-20 01:32:05,wallstreetbets,Lol I have all 4 in my Roth making up about 12% of my portfolio. I’m either dumb as fuck or gonna be retiring at 59 and a half.

2021-04-20 02:07:24,wallstreetbets,Nothing to do with tilray or apha

2021-04-20 02:08:14,wallstreetbets,No
2021-04-20 06:13:01,wallstreetbets,Weeed
2021-04-20 01:31:26,wallstreetbets,Probably a sativa.
2021-04-20 04:15:12,wallstreetbets,Single w/ fries
2021-04-20 00:12:42,wallstreetbets,APHA. 6 shares will convert to 5 TLRY.
2021-04-20 00:27:51,wallstreetbets,"APHA for the arbitrage, its an extra 5% already so why not?"
2021-04-20 02:09:45,wallstreetbets,Cresco labs. Do not listen to tards who think tilray has anything going on in the USA.
2021-04-20 08:50:57,wallstreetbets,1 MSOS or 2 YOLO
2021-04-20 08:03:58,wallstreetbets,Will be $15 by years end.
2021-04-19 23:33:34,wallstreetbets,"When you devise a system of government that unequally weighs population based off of strange geographic lines drawn on a map, that’s what you get."
2021-04-20 00:56:08,wallstreetbets,Based on their own experience it results in blatant hypocrisy and shitty self centered leadership. They really should blame that on 80's coke though.
2021-04-20 01:22:38,wallstreetbets,"Nah man, they still believe it makes black jazz musicians rape white women on their way to church"
2021-04-20 05:22:35,wallstreetbets,"We can thank the senate for that. I think it's a very outdated chamber of congress, the US would be fine with just having a House of representatives with ACTUAL proportional representation. Weed would have been federally legal years ago."
2021-04-19 23:53:52,wallstreetbets,Yeah I know SNDL has a billion shares of trash but hey what's 20$ for some price action omong friends??
2021-04-20 02:08:34,wallstreetbets,Sndl is a total pos. Aphria has nothing to do with the USA.
2021-04-20 12:03:10,wallstreetbets,"I mean, why should it? It's a Canadian company. Cannabis isn't unique to Canada and this legislation isn't going to suddenly allow cannabis to be legal in the United States. Even then, there are plenty of growing operations in the US that have been established and will be able to pounce at the opportunity of legal weed on the federal level. The bill passing the house is only set to benefit US growers.

Sndl was a get-rich-quick scheme thrown on reddit when gme was moved to sell-only."
2021-04-20 02:09:21,wallstreetbets,No it’s a pos
2021-04-20 00:18:30,wallstreetbets,Why can’t you?
2021-04-20 04:16:15,wallstreetbets,Lmao so I shouldn’t have just bought a couple hundred more?
2021-04-19 23:31:26,wallstreetbets,Of course taxes.. That's their way
2021-04-19 23:36:11,wallstreetbets,this is bad for IIPR?
2021-04-20 09:49:04,wallstreetbets,First time in weed stocks?
2021-04-19 23:26:35,wallstreetbets,"If it spikes, sell it ASAP my friend. SNDL is a trash tier company"
2021-04-20 00:22:05,wallstreetbets,Your shares and all the other 1.6 Billion shares all hope to be worth something someday. Lmao.
2021-04-19 23:49:04,wallstreetbets,Very trash
2021-04-20 00:02:42,wallstreetbets,"your bags won't fit through the door, sir"
2021-04-20 08:51:48,wallstreetbets,Baby steps brah don't want these geezers to break a hip trying to do something progressive
2021-04-19 23:32:45,wallstreetbets,"If I could both block you and also downvote you in the future I would. However, I don’t know how to do that so a block will just have to suffice."
2021-04-20 16:54:42,wallstreetbets,I'm invested in two of the MSOs (the biggest one and the Florida based one). Isn't this news good for them? How come the stocks had no positive movement at all for this news?
2021-04-20 07:55:44,wallstreetbets,"Japan is ~14 hours ahead of the US, so your anniversary would be on the 18th if you were married in the morning and the 19th if not."
2021-04-19 23:21:13,wallstreetbets,"Sorry it will be approved 
Look at republican support at the house level
They will get the votes they need for approval"
2021-04-20 13:52:08,wallstreetbets,Vote is 321-101 in the House
2021-04-19 23:50:04,wallstreetbets,"Nah, those of us in GME aren’t going anywhere, but I have long held my marijuana stocks too. I believe it will be decriminalized (hopefully legalized), eventually... hopefully sooner than later."
2021-04-19 23:33:18,wallstreetbets,No.. It's actually news and lots of pple are long on Apha/Tilray.
2021-04-19 23:31:11,wallstreetbets,"those were january. this is april. move on with your lives people, i get it  - you bought amc at 17 and have been holding the bags for awhile. just set them down and back away slowly."
2021-04-20 12:15:22,wallstreetbets,I have a very basic question for you.  Do you think alcohol should be prohibited like marijuana?
2021-04-20 05:09:13,wallstreetbets,Big oof
2021-04-20 06:15:02,wallstreetbets,"If it makes you feel better I lost 20k on tilray when it was in the 200s, I'm retarded"
2021-04-20 06:59:44,wallstreetbets,Look like im not the only retard. I'm  -68% on SNDL and -69% on TLRY.
2021-04-20 08:11:46,wallstreetbets,"-81%, checking in."
2021-04-20 04:54:57,wallstreetbets,Hahaaa I’m glad I’m not alone. I’m still holding SDNY too 🤲💎
2021-04-20 08:41:54,wallstreetbets,"TLRY may be incorporated in the US but they're headquartered in Canada so they already get easy access to corporate financing. If this passes, doesn't that mean Tilray will face better funded competition from US growers?"
2021-04-20 09:19:44,wallstreetbets,I bleed with you my Tilray brother
2021-04-20 10:57:31,wallstreetbets,\-40% and nobody will tell me how much more I plan to lose just buying more
2021-04-20 11:06:53,wallstreetbets,-50% in weed
2021-04-20 11:54:23,wallstreetbets,"-60,03% 

It's not much, but it's honnest work."
2021-04-20 13:11:37,wallstreetbets,Try down 72%
2021-04-20 13:22:03,wallstreetbets,Well done. That’s twice as good as the avg return here
2021-04-20 14:56:56,wallstreetbets,Lucky you. I'm down 61.88%
2021-04-20 08:35:12,wallstreetbets,Tlry the Canadian company? Wonder why NYC legalization didn’t moon that stock that it doesn’t impact.
2021-04-20 05:10:38,wallstreetbets,"Can you imagine people on youtube making branded cocaine reviews?

2021-04-20 03:15:29,wallstreetbets,I'll lose a lot of weight when cocaine becomes legal
2021-04-20 02:37:38,wallstreetbets,"No, it’s because the market is smarter than people assume and legalization in NY was virtually priced in. Everyone knows it’s just a matter of time for a lot of states, and long term federally."
2021-04-20 05:19:52,wallstreetbets,"69 updoots.

Nice"

2021-04-20 03:35:21,wallstreetbets,"Oh absolutely. I mean it makes no actual sense, so I’m definitely in."
2021-04-20 14:04:00,wallstreetbets,The day isn’t over yet! Maybe everyone is still sleeping? Lol
2021-04-20 01:15:59,wallstreetbets,It is all of our Birthdays now.

2021-04-20 09:23:27,wallstreetbets,HBD. It's also my wife's bday. Her BF said I can see her after he's finished.
2021-04-20 00:09:31,wallstreetbets,It's the Second Coming of ~~Christ~~ Hitler!
2021-04-19 23:45:38,wallstreetbets,It’s almost April 20 and this is happening
2021-04-20 05:52:40,wallstreetbets,"No personal attacks, please."
2021-04-20 01:53:03,wallstreetbets,I'm with you @18 just twiddling my thumbs
2021-04-20 02:05:38,wallstreetbets,I averaged down to 21. Let's goooo

2021-04-20 01:43:11,wallstreetbets,"Hey hey, I’m a sister :) tomorrow is 4/20 and I expect the stock to react simply based on that fact. I’m expecting a spike of some kind. Which is beyond bizarre that I’m even saying this considering I do a ton of research on companies before I buy them. But the market has changed oh so much."
2021-04-20 02:10:09,wallstreetbets,Tilray has nothing to do with the USA. That dude is clueless.
2021-04-20 09:31:59,wallstreetbets,"I’ve never even been given the option at any local dispensaries to use my debit card. It’s just annoying to hope I have enough cash on me to cover whatever I purchase, I only take cash out for a dispensary trip at this point. I could use the ATM inside, but I really don’t want to pay the couple of bucks to make at w/d at a dispensary ATM"
2021-04-20 07:43:50,wallstreetbets,Same. It's like betting on Budweiser in 1920 tho
2021-04-20 08:32:41,wallstreetbets,Why not both?
2021-04-20 13:32:06,wallstreetbets,I think that is a good long term play for your Roth.

I want to come back in a couple of years to congratulate you ‘tarded fucks"

2021-04-20 01:32:16,wallstreetbets,Hell yeah I’ve been holding APHA since it was $7. I’ve been wishing I sold that day it shot over $26.
2021-04-20 00:25:32,wallstreetbets,Come on!!! APHA to the moon! I have leaps and shares
2021-04-19 23:08:35,wallstreetbets,Does this really effect Canadian companies or just us based ones?
2021-04-20 12:27:26,wallstreetbets,What's that 15 by 4/21 ?
2021-04-20 07:28:27,wallstreetbets,"Also old people vote more, so they vote for old people, and those old people listen to the old people."
2021-04-20 02:45:25,wallstreetbets,My SNDL 4/23 1cs are already ITM ATH and they cost me four cents.
2021-04-20 02:36:52,wallstreetbets,"That’s why they reverse merged with TLRY. Tilray is US-based. As is their beverage acquisition, Sweetwater Brewing.

I’ve been long APHA for a very long time. Also have been holding TLRY 1/20/2023 12c since the merger was announced."
2021-04-20 00:31:01,wallstreetbets,"Curaleaf is a OTC stock and therefore it doesn’t follow the strict rules regarding large cap stocks, which is what wsb is all about. Which I’m all for... except in scenarios like this. Then again...I’m glad I don’t see fucking Penny stock yolos on here tbh."
2021-04-20 02:09:06,wallstreetbets,Yes. Weed companies can get loans and not have to pay up to iipr
2021-04-20 08:15:44,wallstreetbets,It’s still solid stock with LT leases & dividend. But I’m broke. I need risk / reward. I tripled my $. So I took it & ran
2021-04-20 09:49:27,wallstreetbets,Second but still.
2021-04-19 23:31:04,wallstreetbets,Really bad weed. I feel like products aren’t discussed enough. Shit weed.
2021-04-19 23:30:46,wallstreetbets,What he said
2021-04-19 23:29:03,wallstreetbets,Was hoping to capitalize on tomorrow's 4/20 spike for some quick gains 💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼
2021-04-20 08:10:16,wallstreetbets,Huh?
2021-04-20 09:54:34,wallstreetbets,Lmao you right
2021-04-20 00:34:39,wallstreetbets,Walk and chew gum is okay too
2021-04-20 13:03:41,wallstreetbets,"Yeah.  Sure.  The are tons of benefits during prohibition for kids, suicides, domestic abuse, etc."
2021-04-20 05:22:54,wallstreetbets,"It's not worthy loss porn though, small potatoes."
2021-04-20 11:13:51,wallstreetbets,"Damn bro that hurts.  I'm down 27% on SNDL and 23% APHA.  My average cost on SNDL is only 1.25, so hoping to recover!!  SNDL has so much cash on hand that they must do *something* with it!!  Hoping they make a big play soon and don't do a reverse split."
2021-04-20 07:57:14,wallstreetbets,"Ah, fellow peak buyer. We truly are the kings of the stonk market."
2021-04-20 07:04:27,wallstreetbets,Damn finally someone that beat me to make me feel better. -60% on sndl lol
2021-04-20 19:39:18,wallstreetbets,Down -93% on ACB and -84% SPRWF

All evidence points to the fact that market is not smart nor do market participants have the foresight to have assets valuations appropriately priced in.

2021-04-20 15:45:46,wallstreetbets,"My only worry is that it has the problem ag products have- to make more money you grow more but then that decreases the price leading to a race to the bottom price wise. Ag survives because of subsidies, I kinda doubt weed will get subsidies.

That said it’s made plenty of money when it’s been illegal and now there will likely be more people buying it so I’m pretty bullish."

2021-04-20 05:49:55,wallstreetbets,"Could be worse, I originally bought in on that day you're wishing you had sold.  Fun fact, did you know that on that day it went as high as $29.73?  I do, because it says so in my tax lots.  Fortunately I've averaged down to $16.95 but there's some definite bag-holding over here.

I suck at trying to momentum buying meme stocks when emotional, I really need to stop doing that sort of thing and just accept missing stuff."

Yes, and I’m probably oversimplifying here, but the goal is to invest in companies building the best brands (Cresco Labs for example). Right now, many states require that they grow their own, and I think those states are not going to change all that dramatically because it’s good for job growth and retention. But to hedge against the agriculture issue, the companies that are processing the stuff, packaging it to get the most accurate dosages, and keep it squeaky clean in terms of government regs will do the best in the long run.

Starbucks doesn’t really grow their own coffee beans. They have a tiny *finca* somewhere, but virtually all of their agriculture is outsourced. Still a powerful brand.

And I know people who have smoked their whole lives and are cancer free but those that dodge cancer still likely develop emphysema and chronic bronchitis later. I’m just saying that I think taxing things like cigarettes that result in a high societal cost is fair. 

According to the CDC in the US, 480,000 die from smoking related deaths annually and the cost of the terminal care to taxpayers is astronomical. 

I got to thinking about this and did some digging.  Check [this ](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199710093371506) out.  Health care costs for smokers at a given age are as much as 40 percent higher than those for nonsmokers, but their tend to die a lot more quickly so their healthcare costs are temporary/capped. If everybody quit smoking, after all of the currently smokers died off, healthcare costs would actually rise because over time, people living longer costs more."

I'm still long CCL, NCLH, JETS, and EXPE but not much movement since February. 2 names have higher beta and look much better from a technical perspective, with not as much headline coverage.

1. CWH (Camping World Wide) - the pandemic essentially brought forward purchases from anyone who was planning on RVing/camping over the next few years all to 2020 and 2021. Though there are some fintwit dudes who think the RV trend saw its peak in 2020 - I highly doubt folks who spent 50-100k on an RV are going to let their fancy Airstream pocket buses idle just to make it to happy hour at Texas Roadhouse when everything reopens. IMO, the US might be ahead in vaccinations, but the outdoor camping, hiking, and exploring crowd have kicked off a new multi-year trend. Ask yourself, how many of you/your friends have posted pics of their latest hike on IG featuring their newly adopted covid puppy? Almost forgot about the company itself: CWH sells RVs, but most of the margin is derived from services and memberships. They are also partnered to develop an EV RV. The CEO is Marcus Lemonis, who is the Prophet (comes on after Shark Tank). From a technical perspective, CWH is about to break its ATH made back in 2017. Who knows what happens after $43. Probably $44, but then what?
2. ELY (Callaway Golf) - the play is pretty simple, golfing is outdoors and is at least upper middle if not upper class. These guys (some of you) spend thousands on clubs, and thousands on memberships and fees - golf was essentially unaffected by the pandemic and if anything probably got a much needed bump in participation. If the pandemic continues to rage on, this semi-outdoor activity will be booked out. If the pandemic is magically over by summer, this semi-outdoor activity is booked out anyways. To top this off, Callaway just pulled off the most synergistic move since Exxon and Mobil merged, and recently completed the purchase of TopGolf. What's wonderful about this is activity is it revolves mostly around drinking and food and drinking. And they are busy 100% of 70% of the time. [Check out this DD from another poster a few weeks ago on how booked out Topgolf really is.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mdsx3i/ely_dd_i_tried_making_an_online_reservation_at_60/) It also draws golfers and non-golfers alike, so essentially the TAM is the whole world. While golfing as a sport is probably not what it was 20 years ago, this ain't about sports. This is hanging out and getting trashed while trying to one up your friends wood game. Edit: I figured this is self explanatory, but yes I forgot to mention some folks who try Top Golf might end up purchasing Callaway clubs and actually golfing on a course, but this is marginal IMO. Not everyone who goes bowling ends up with a bowling ball. Amirite? Guys? Anywhoo, me like. 

As always, do your own DD. I like the stonks. Not financial researcher advisor professor. Just dude."

If people believe that hedge funds are paying people to come to wsb to post about specific tickers, then why the assumption that they'd have--and then just leave-- their heads in the sand on crowded shorts that are rising in post frequency?  That they'd not hedge their short positions?

If volume blows up, you don't think the shorts would cover, but that they WOULD be so acutely aware of wsb that they'd send a counterinsurgency squad or whatever."

2021-04-20 11:39:41,wallstreetbets,I love shorting. I’m currently shorting the stocks that I’m bullish on just in anticipation of a pull back (happens every 40 days on my stock’s chart... like clockwork). I’ve made $2k off of $15k budget in the last 2 days because of my shorts. Riding this shit down to my buy-in target price.
2021-04-20 02:39:34,wallstreetbets,Can confirm.  Shorts just went entirely to obliterate small cap and emerging tech and the entire OTC.  Blood bath...
2021-04-20 00:01:32,wallstreetbets,Yep. I joined in February and nothing I put my money in has made any meaningful gains. It's just a sea of red that occasionally teases some gains for a day and then drops even more.
2021-04-20 02:17:12,wallstreetbets,"Absolutely correct. OTC was experiencing one of its best periods in decades from nov-Jan and ever since it has just been an absolute blood bath. Things were over bought, for sure. But the shorting has been brutal. Just look at HMBL today. I bought TSNP pre split at what equates to 0.94. I sold hesitantly at $3.30 2 days ago and here we are at $1.70."

If they don't like the stock they should simply not hold it instead of incentivizing themselves to destroy/slander/drive-down a company made up of working people.

Edit: the purpose of stocks is to pool money together to start an enterprise, and to share risks and rewards. 

Shorting stocks should be forbidden. There are too many downsides.

Look at RIOT ... I've looked at a lot of stocks I'm buying puts on and I'm blown away at how few shorts are in. So, when someone upgrades a stock $30 higher, it scares nobody and only the longs that are underwater sell into the strength as they want a rest from this insanity. It used to be upgrades caused sustained rallies as shorts covered.  Here are some recently upgraded stocks:: RCL ABNB both of them about 3 weeks ago I think.

Think a stock is overpriced? Sell a call or buy a put.

Of course, naked selling calls do expose you to risk.
However, I feel we should modify calls to have a maximum cash buy out clause.

E.g. a call for $10 could have a clause that instead of delivery of the stock, the seller can also deliver X times the the strike price, so 10x ($100) or 2X ($20). 

I think this would make the options market more efficient and less risky."

Most of the DD here, though hard work, should pretty much be reversed, while most of the sure gains boomer stocks have been losing money.

There are no stock picks, there is just you buying into shit stock early before more retarded goons bought into it and propped up your pos and hopefully you exited on time.

I bought and held GME(@16.5), APHA (@7 or so), TSLA (@405) and DIS/MSFT(forgot) in and out and made ridiculous gains, but I would have the conceit to say that I ""picked"" those stocks...

2021-04-20 05:24:01,wallstreetbets,"that's pretty smart strategy. You only lose once you sell with a loss. I sold my MRNA and CVAC with a gain. I could have gained some more, but I put stop losses once I'm green and just increase them periodically. I still hold my PLTR, because my retarded broker had ""system issues"" when I wanted to sell it on a peak a few days ago. Now I am still holding it, because I ain't gonna sell it with a loss. It's either bringing me money or going to 0, I don't give a flying fuck. I mean I give, I want my tendies. But it's tendies or nothing, no middle ground."
2021-04-20 03:00:30,wallstreetbets,"I know right? Lol. But my broker handles all the mutual funds, utilities, ETFs, Long term secure gains.

2021-04-20 14:17:25,wallstreetbets,"There is a better alternative to shorts: writing laws against financial fraud, marketing fraud, dangerous products, and more.

I know people hate lawyers, but holding companies or even execs accountable through lawsuits and fines, all be it fines and damages need to be much more punitive than they have been recently, makes poorly run or researched companies less attractive investments.

And when damaging information is found, the rewards are distributed back to the injured consumers, investors, employees, etc and not to a hedge fund manager."

Like someone said, supply and demand. If it's overvalued there will be no demand, if it's undervalued there will be no supply."
2021-04-20 19:46:39,wallstreetbets,"It's one thing to say, ""my product is worth a billion dollars, and shares are worth $100 each, and I'm selling $10T worth of shares"", then letting the market go, ""weeell, we don't think so, but you do you. I'm not buying it"". Which, if we apply the laws of supply and demand, will drive down the price of the shares.  

It's another thing entirely to artificially deflate the shares, because you think they're way overpriced, and after shorting it, you'll make money off it. 

Point is, if you don't like it, don't buy it, which delivers natural justice, so to speak. Artificially lowering the prices, is playing the role of executioner, and profiting from it. And it's wrong."

2021-04-20 04:19:08,wallstreetbets,"Thats really as much ""if's"" as they could potentially keep dropping while the winners could keep gaining. 

Theres absolutely nothing wrong with taking profit and buying dips, don't get me wrong. But markets tend to trend in the same direction for extended periods of time. Take tech stock vs value stock for example. Tech has been outperforming for over a decade. If you'd been diversified in a few years ago but kept cutting your tech winners to buy undervalued value stocks, you'd have turned a well-performing diversified portfolio into an underperforming, frustrating set of holdings."
2021-04-20 10:21:16,wallstreetbets,Exactly. I think people with lots of money to play with can afford to make these riskier choices. The market is a casino and at some point every investment tanks.

You glossed over that part. Generally, we accept automation because over the long time scale it benefits everyone. The cost is short-term job loss and pain, which society accepts. Melvin doesn't produce anything of value, and their actions cost people real pain. Entities like Melvin cost us pain and provide no value to us.

2021-04-20 00:49:24,wallstreetbets,"If anything, the distortions and volatility introduced by shorting *undermine* the ability of a stock to settle at fair value, as evidenced by GME and VW squeezes, among countless other less dramatic examples.

You seem to be arguing that shorting prevents bubbles?  That’s clearly not the case, as shorting currently exists and so do bubbles."
2021-04-20 04:48:34,wallstreetbets,"You mean that shorting is the only defense against hype?  No.  Investing in an company, overvalued or otherwise, provides that company with potential.  Don’t like the company?  Don’t invest.  In time, the company either proves it’s value or it slowly declines.  Shorting, however, is hoping for a company to fail which is a bet against prosperity.  Coupled with media manipulation, shorting also gives the elite live or die leverage of a companies future.  Fuck that."
2021-04-20 00:35:21,wallstreetbets,"lol i agree with everything you say. my original statement was absolutely meant in jest. I want to say these people are pieces of shit, but i also do find it a bit ""similar"" in some way to automation in general, but again cede the original point that these people create nothing of value, other than value itself."

Now the problem I have with it is once you’ve replied you’ve volunteered to get into the conversation but you’re actual words seem to say you can’t be bothered to give a response. So your words say one thing but your actions another and I’m left confused."
2021-04-20 02:35:52,wallstreetbets,GME haven’t squeezed yet but rest I agree with.
2021-04-20 07:37:17,wallstreetbets,Well put. Even an idiot like me could understand this
2021-04-20 00:42:31,wallstreetbets,"It's funny my lab group last week was having this debate about automation and its impact on society. I don't think they brought it up, but I think the pace of automation is what we're feeling in terms of lots of job loss. The basic idea that things got automated/jobs were lost at a gradual pace in the past, and now that pace is accelerating. Like it either needs to be a gradual pace or a very rapid pace , anything in between may feel too burdensome without government intervention"
2021-04-20 01:01:12,wallstreetbets,"I think once I know someone will reply in kind, I will give an honest response. I suppose I can't be bothered to give a response unless that is known"

2021-04-20 01:53:36,wallstreetbets,"Sure, but I run into morons who are wrong all the time on the internet and I've always found it best to just ignore them.  The phrase ""don't feed the troll"" is a trope for a reason.  I've just taken my reply to mean that I'm acknowledging I expect a good faith response or that I'm down for a shit throwing contest. 

And because I'm actually paying to give you gold I'm not afraid to say I started talking to you with the expectation that you'd just throw shit back at me.  I was bored at work and saw my pet peeve so figured, wtf, I haven't thrown shit in a few days.  You came back with a real response and I feel the need to reward that and punish my bad faith, if I'm being absolutely honest."
2021-04-20 01:05:07,wallstreetbets,That generational tech rebound is so fascinating. Best of luck with the right direction pointing with your teenager. I'm sure if you keep pointing them in the right direction they will eventually follow course

2021-04-20 00:10:34,wallstreetbets,Trailing stop losses that are good til cancelled once your position is profitable enough. Fire and forget. It's saved me a lot of pain of watching an option go 3x then expire worthless.

2021-04-20 11:05:48,wallstreetbets,"It’s because RH option Chain is water downed to appeal to the crowd that learned about options 3 months ago with GME. 

Most making money in RH is essentially doing it because of luck because I highly doubt the average person is looking at the volume or the Greeks or the IV to make educated option play. (DD essentially means “saw post in WSB”)

Because you cannot with RH only. There isn’t enough (or really any) indicators to make that play. Your posts shows the option bought date but while I don’t know what time you bought,  365.5$ at April 16 was one of the worst chain to buy due to its delta/Theta ratio

You’d make more money buying almost any other strike at the same time"

2021-04-20 01:04:12,wallstreetbets,"https://www.cloverhealth.com/en/plans

Then go to Medicare.gov and compare plans against whatever zip code you typed on Clovers website.

Then read the summary of benefits side by side to get a sense of whether one company or another has better plan options and benefits.

Also look for ""extras"" like dental, vision, OTC benefits. 

Then you can go back to Clovers' website and look to see what regions they offer plans in? How about their competitors?

Take a peek at some of the other insurers' websites and plans. 

This should help get your research started."

It's entirely possible given the reduction in covid cases, but 5/20 will either be really good, or really bad."

I don't expect a reduction in covid cases long term--short term, by summery time and more vaccinations, magical disappearance, but i'm in the long long term.  
At the very least, I hope to get rid of my bags. I can continue selling covered calls, but ehh."
2021-04-20 01:27:58,wallstreetbets,"You feel quarterly filing tells you all you need to know about a company to make an informed decision?

You don't think its a good idea to look at their products and see how they stack up against a competitors product?

Or how many areas of the country they serve?"
2021-04-20 12:12:43,wallstreetbets,"Because the runup was last week and early Monday.  Now the HFs just dumping excess shares to the bagholders.  Cover was pre-bought, already happened.  Get people excited on Monday, sell a bunch of way OTM calls at various strikes as it quick gaps up to $10+ for fat premiums.  Sell the extra shares you bought, make money by opening new shorts so all those calls end up worthless by expiration.  CLOV SI isn't as high as hyped either."

2021-04-19 21:25:06,wallstreetbets,I did my due diligence and I know the healthcare sector very well. Great company and is going to be a major disruption for competitors. Most likely they grow rapidly and take market share or they get acquired in less than two years.
2021-04-19 22:25:37,wallstreetbets,Agreed. Crazy old guy w a microphone...
2021-04-20 01:36:06,wallstreetbets,"Normally no. But they only have cash to last 3 months, if margins don't improve. That means they have to issue debt or shares in the near future, which will drive down the price more.

That's why the SI is so high. Doesn't matter how good your product is if you run out of cash to keep the company going."
2021-04-20 13:43:31,wallstreetbets,"So I’m copying and pasting my own comment from another area, just trying to figure out why there is so much confusion. Everywhere I am reading is saying that the short interest was “updated” to 35% after adding in the CEOs shares. The CEO can’t trade those shares until they are at $30 for 90 consecutive days? So how are those even allowed to be in the calculation for a sub $10 stock? Something isn’t adding up so I just am holding and waiting. But if I’m wrong on any of my points, please correct me. Trying to figure out what the missing details are."
2021-04-19 21:35:48,wallstreetbets,It’s always the same shit. Listen up dipshit... if you helped raise capital for a company and were given millions of shares you could sell for hundred of millions of dollars you would fuckin sell... stop being a sorry bitch and focus on your own investments. Chamath is obviously very good at what he does I suggest you find something of your own rather than wasting time trolling and muttering comments that are not even original or have substance. Stupid fuck.
2021-04-20 12:49:02,wallstreetbets,"Lmao no, no, no. Not at all. Not even close. Lmao. Lmao."

2021-04-19 21:26:05,wallstreetbets,"Oh don't get me wrong, I'm in it too. Just don't got that kinda capital to put up 😂"
2021-04-20 13:55:09,wallstreetbets,"The problem is the calcs Im seeing double count about 30,500,000 of those locked up shares. If you adjust the math for that the short interest is much lower. Additionally, we didnt get the news of crazy high SI% until after it has a runup from 7->10 dollars. So the plan was to run it up, report high SI, get people buying, cover the shorts with the cheap shares and now you're free to start shorting again with a clean slate."

2021-04-20 00:27:26,wallstreetbets,I’m holding. If it pops big I have calls to sell for profit. If it goes to 100 then fuck yes I’m selling but I have no intention of selling under 35 and even then it will only be half my position. I plan on selling covered calls against my position in the future for monthly income as I do with all my investments.
2021-04-20 00:49:32,wallstreetbets,"Yup, covered calls have been good for me on pops. If it reaches $100 I will gladly sell my entire position and my call options will print!"

It also means having enough time to see prices rise enough to sell these for a profit... He just need someone crazy enough to buy it."

2021-04-19 22:15:03,wallstreetbets,"Hey.... why don’t you put something in your post that highlights its current short interest? That would definitely get more attention on here IMO. A crazy YOLO + The possibility of a short squeeze = why DFV is a legend. You are doing the EXACT same thing. DFV liked GME because of its deep fucking value at $4.50 a share. This stock IMO is “deep fucking value” territory. Therefore you should highlight the short interest aspect, and some DD to go along with it... then you’re yolo positions.

2021-04-20 15:21:08,wallstreetbets,Like the stock too but this is a fucked up call strategy. The stock was only 100 because of Bill’s Wang.

2021-04-20 00:42:02,wallstreetbets,It has volatility. The game can go both ways.
2021-04-19 21:39:42,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, understood but you're still gonna need to hold until at least some sort of noticeable gains."
2021-04-19 23:15:03,wallstreetbets,Don't strippers say that as well?
2021-04-20 11:13:48,wallstreetbets,"I’m reading this twice and still have no idea what you are trying to say. 

Why would selling calls to make some premium be hinder by the fact his calls are OTM? 

This is the equivalent of saying “I see you’re  thirsty, drink some water! Or wait, I see you’re wearing red shirt, never mind”. Your first and second reply don’t logically make any sense"

2021-04-20 00:45:19,wallstreetbets,If only it went my way🙇🏻‍♂️
2021-04-20 12:57:12,wallstreetbets,Because if your selling calls that are covered by these calls he bought he may be forced to exit these positions at the cost of the calls he purchased. Generally you need itm calls and sell otm calls. That way you can collect premium and if the share prices rises dramatically your purchaed calls have enough room to cover you and usually still give you a profit.
2021-04-19 21:10:13,wallstreetbets,"Dark, yet very sound."
2021-04-19 21:20:43,wallstreetbets,"You don’t see the value of the long term then. If my thesis is right, these current losses won’t mean jack shit when they are all in the money, minus the short term calls. I will be buying even more shares and calls depending on how things lead up prior to earnings. I am a “paytient” man 😉👁"
2021-04-19 21:23:37,wallstreetbets,"You are correct yes, but why don’t you use technicals to get a better idea of when to buy those calls for less downside...  more upside ? Is my point"
2021-04-19 23:27:20,wallstreetbets,What's your thesis? Cant find it
2021-04-19 21:28:16,wallstreetbets,"Bad timing on my part to be honest, but I’m not really sweating the losses in general as I am going to average down on both the share cost and cost of my calls as the days go by. I do understand your point  though."

2021-04-20 00:33:39,wallstreetbets,"TFSA is a bad account for retard YOLOs. Your gains are tax-free, but you can't write-off your losses."

2021-04-20 01:19:52,wallstreetbets,"Naw, just the the stock has been reading sideways for a while now. The updates from DFV and the guy that wants to own GME is nice but the daily thread is a massive echo chamber without much happening. 

Once GME gets going again, it'll probably be back."

2021-04-19 22:42:58,wallstreetbets,Just curious. How much did you “YOLO”?
2021-04-20 00:33:41,wallstreetbets,Paying $160 for a stock that should be about $40 months after a short squeeze should be sufficiently retarded to count.
2021-04-19 21:58:15,wallstreetbets,since this sub became r gme
2021-04-19 22:08:13,wallstreetbets,Lmfao the downvotes. Iv got 100 but these ppl are donuts.

2021-04-19 21:32:03,wallstreetbets,Not that 32k isn't a lot of money. But shares aren't a YOLO. You can just sit on them forever. Its options that take huge balls.

2021-04-20 04:28:33,wallstreetbets,Sold out or just wanted the sub to return to what it was? A YOLO used to be some guy buying FDs that expired soon or something to that degree. Pretty different meaning.

WSB *is* GME, AMC, BB etc.  At least it is until it’s not and the mods shouldn’t force a new narrative.  WSB is where we talk GME.  If people don’t like that they can downvote the posts.  It’s self-regulating.  What do you mean **when shit blows up***?  I think we’re all prepared for if/when GME tanks.  Only a true retard wouldn’t think that was a very likely possibility...

2021-04-20 01:24:12,wallstreetbets,Or that you dont understand the situation so you take baby win daytrading when the real win comes from holding. Weird that youd get down votes omg such an echo chamber 🙄

 I like it a lot so far, however they don't let you transfer money between a margin account and a TFSA like questrade does. 

Also I didn't do my research to find out that you can't buy fractional shares in a TFSA account which was one of my main reasons for switching :/"

2021-04-20 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$DGX Quest Diagnostics IV - Earnings Extravaganza This is the last DD before **earnings this Thursday (pre-market).**

Previous DDs so you can disregard them one more time:

1. [DGX (Quest Diagnostics) is Free Tendies](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lktkjr/dgx_quest_diagnostics_is_free_tendies/)
2. [$DGX Quest Diagnostics Pt. 2 - Electric Boogaloo](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m2dtqk/dgx_quest_diagnostics_pt_2_electric_boogaloo/)
3. [$DGX Quest Diagnostics Pt. 3 - Leading a Redditor to Tendies](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mhtipi/dgx_quest_diagnostics_pt_3_leading_a_redditor_to/)

**Updated snapshot of consolidated option position** (stock in separate account). Open calls, heavily weighted towards safer strikes because I'm a pansy. Position is understated both in total and net return by about $20k because Ally is hot garbage.

[Open: May 21 $125, $130, $135. Aug 20 $120, $125, $130, $140, $145, $150, $160 ](https://preview.redd.it/xcprmy2ub7u61.png?width=1631&format=png&auto=webp&s=975fbcfbc92569cdc660d471ad5f391ce39a236d)

**TL;DR yet again** \- Quest performed over 10.4 million COVID tests during Q1 and base case testing has rebounded. They are still executing over $900 million in share repurchases over the next 3 months, which equates to a buyback of roughly 5% of their float. Then they have another $ BILLION of repurchases authorized for the back half of 2021 as well. Additionally, the technicals are some of the most bullish I've ever seen. And yet, the company still trades well behind their top competitor, Labcorp $LH. **I'll say it until I'm blue in the face from wearing these 6 masks, $DGX remains the safest trade in this market.**

**$DGX vs $LH** \- Look, I think I've beaten this comparison to death over the previous DDs, so I'll just add this quick table reflecting DGX share price as a % of LH. Note that prices are somewhat smoothed within each month.

https://preview.redd.it/rnve5wp4h7u61.png?width=704&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb8af65266c0df12e9022e4ba9b2c93cb04e4a6b

That's a pretty damn consistent trend isn't it? And don't worry, I know you aren't here to do math. If $DGX was trading at a conservative 60% of LH, it would be $156. Right now. Now, people can argue the LH Covance acquisition makes their growth prospects better than Quest. Maybe. But it certainly shouldn't drive this large of a variance.

**Charting / Technicals** \- Virtually all technicals are neutral or **VERY bullish** at this point. I also encourage those who like charting to checkout the 1-2 year trend. Then for more fun, take a look at the intraday trading over the last 60ish days. Look, I think charting is worthless 95% of the time as are technicals without a lot of context, but there are some obvious patterns in trading over the last couple months specifically. To me, it's clear institutions have been deliberately chasing out retail and consistently repurchasing at a lower price. On-balance Volume is soaring, which when combined with other metrics, is a great indicator of large ""smart money"" bets. This happens all the time. It's why stocks like Apple unexpectedly flatline for substantial periods of time, then make a huge move upward on ""info"" or ""results"" that you thought were easily foreseeable long ago.

**Institutions** and other big boys (or, conversely, dbag hedgefunds) - **13F filings** in Q1 and Q2 (so far) were absurdly bullish on $DGX, buying the stock at nearly a $4 to $1 rate. This is a much higher rate than usual for $DGX and VASTLY higher than the ratio of $$$ intuitions are putting into $LH.

**Shorts/shorting because this is WSB after all -** The amount of shares short is surprisingly interesting right now. Sure, an increase in shares short to nearly 4m doesn't seem like a lot on a float of 132m at face value. But $DGX has 90% institutional ownership, the majority of which isn't being moved (Vanguard is largest owner and Quest has a solid dividend). So the public/retail is really playing with 16m shares or so. Then factor in $DGX is repurchasing around 14 million shares this year, depending on buyback price. **Now that 4 million shares short becomes VERY material.**

**$DGX Q1 Performance -** I still expect a big beat, projecting over $4 EPS on a lower than expected drop off in COVID testing, substantial increases in base testing (core business), increasing acquisition revenue, and additional COVID research projects. Quest continues to flat out tell you they are still crushing COVID testing. Sure, it's down slightly from Q4, but remains much higher than 2020 Q2 and Q3. Adjusted run rate for April remains high as well. And now they will have base testing back again. [https://newsroom.questdiagnostics.com/COVIDTestingUpdates](https://newsroom.questdiagnostics.com/COVIDTestingUpdates)

**Price Expectations by EOY:**

* Worst case - $150. Yea, I'm serious. Baring a market meltdown driven by tax policy changes, this baby is a lock.
* Best case - $200

**Disclaimer:** I'm a rando on a message board, yada yada yada, not investment advice. Ally SUCKS as a brokerage. Use someone else. Long live GME."
2021-04-19 20:12:37,wallstreetbets,Thank you for making me feel good about my DGX 5 21 145c
2021-04-20 15:22:48,wallstreetbets,"I apologize. I bought 20 5/21 $130 C today, so that’s the reason for the drop."

2021-04-19 20:11:27,wallstreetbets,"145 is still quite a bit of an FD for a month out since DGX is at its all the time high currently

My recent 130s just printed, and i have some 135s expiring in 2 months that I'm not confident on tbh"
2021-04-19 20:03:41,wallstreetbets,\*checks date\*
2021-04-20 15:56:06,wallstreetbets,"I posted this earlier in another thread. I also bought the same at $3.30 today. Exited for 10% return. I think you'll be fine though.  

**Update** for those wondering why it's down almost 2% right now, along with $LH: Competitor Abbott Labs missed estimates this AM due to lower than forecasted COVID revenue. However, their base business recovery exceeded expectations.

If anything this reaffirms my thesis regarding $DGX. We know COVID testing for them is still high per their own press releases. And now we know base testing is gonna rebound too."
2021-04-19 20:23:02,wallstreetbets,"Yea, 145s should have been moved earlier in month on run up to $132. 

That said, those still have a shot. Just a little too dicey for me."
2021-04-19 20:22:11,wallstreetbets,I bought this like 2 months ago so it wasnt AS much of an FD. At this point I’m hoping for a spike at earnings to sell and get out maybe roll it over to later in the year
2021-04-19 20:07:22,wallstreetbets,I should probably drink less before getting on reddit. maybe
2021-04-19 20:33:02,wallstreetbets,"I’m relatively confident that they’ll hit 132+ by Friday if not before. I’ve seen estimates that the stock could move around 5% based off earnings since there hasn’t been much of a move yet, which could potentially put them closer to $140 if they beat earnings. Oh, and their dividend pays out Wednesday which will hopefully start the price run up."
2021-04-19 20:27:31,wallstreetbets,"3 months out? yeah that's fair go then

I think 145 prints just not yet"
2021-04-19 20:08:34,wallstreetbets,Drink until you find your balmer's peak then hold onto it
2021-04-19 20:38:14,wallstreetbets,"The ex-dividend date is what matters, and that was earlier this month. Payout date doesn't matter. Just a heads up.

I expect $135min by end of week."
2021-04-19 20:42:40,wallstreetbets,"Why would the ex date be more important? When the RKT dividend payment hit the stock jumped $2 that morning due to reinvestment, so I was assuming the same would apply to DGX."
2021-04-19 21:43:34,wallstreetbets,Ex-dividend is what typically impacts the stock price. It's the date you need to own the stock by in order to actually receive the next dividend payout.

2021-04-19 22:07:17,wallstreetbets,That's not really how it works my dude.  Market makers don't buy 100 shares every time someone buys a call.  They adjust their position based on delta in order to stay delta neutral.
2021-04-19 21:43:20,wallstreetbets,"If they are hedging, which they should be, they only buy the Delta of the 100 shares per contract. The $10c for 5/21 have a delta of 0.55. No you go 2 strikes ITM and you hit a delta of 0.79.. the other way and you hit 0.38 delta.. 0.22 higher and 0.17 lower respectively. As the OTM calls move closer to the money and eventually into the money, the hedge will have to increase. Eventually nearing 1.00 or s full hedge. 

Regardless, the calls will help plus a great way to leverage your position. But I'm not Greek, I'm German.. so what do I know"

Lost almost 10 million on those BABA options mostly between December & February expirations, then I got smoked on FB when the GME squeeze killed that play by making all those Suits dump FB to cover the GME losses.  Those two plays definitely hurt.  If this works out halfway right I’ll probably roll the funds back into BABA, BIDU, JD PDD & OZON options spread out in various strikes and expirations between June 21 & June 2023 if the China stocks are still way down after this play.

2021-04-20 10:06:02,wallstreetbets,"I think what he's trying to say is that hes looking for deep ITM calls with paltry open interest. In that case, theoretically, yes - he could spike the price that way.

Example - the -CLOV210521C2.5 has a delta of 1. And like, 120~ open interest.

The only advantage I can see to doing this (because you're effectively paying for the stock) is that it continues to lever your position on potential upside. There are some advantages on the downside should the price fall or flatten - deep ITM tend to go up in parity-ish with the underlying, but they dont fall as fast."
2021-04-20 01:17:32,wallstreetbets,"Why do so many posters on WSB not know about delta.

On the bright side, that low delta could cause a gamma squeeze if the prices move quickly enough."
2021-04-20 02:08:20,wallstreetbets,"So... to me it sounds like he's mixing up a bunch of concepts and not really getting the details right.

Delta hedging: When a market maker sells you a call contract they have to hedge that contract by buying shares so that if you decide to exercise that contract they have the shares ready to sell you without losing any money in the trade. Market Makers strictly make their profit by making a few pennies off the difference between the bid and ask price, but they don't gamble stonks the way degenerate apes like you and I do. 1 call contract = 100 shares, HOWEVER they will only hedge 100 shares \* the current delta value for that contract. A contract that is exactly in the money (i.e. $15 strike price and the stock is currently trading for $15) will have exactly .5 delta so 100 shares \* .5 delta = the MM has to purchase 50 shares to be hedged.  The delta on calls that are at the money moves the most quickly (this means they have very high gamma), so going up one dollar from $15 to $16 will have a huge effect on the amount that needs to be hedged versus if the stock goes from $18 to $19 (and the strike price is still only $15). Stocks that are deep in the money will have a delta of 1 and so 1 call = 100 stonks.

None of this has anything to do with Open Interest, as far as I know. Open interest is how many contracts are currently owned (and therefore active) by people or institutions. You can see the May contracts for Clov are [HEAVILY](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CLOV/options?p=CLOV) slanted towards OTM calls which could cause a gamma squeeze. This is part of what caused GME to explode, but one difference here is that Clov only trades monthly options whereas GME trades weekly options. I'm honestly not sure how contracts with expirations that are weeks away will effect a potential gamma squeeze, but it's something to be aware of."

My dumb ass missis the majority of the GME play because I was all with damn BABA calls, that bit me hard and I’ve kept going back for more.

Those two plays definitely hurt.  If this works out halfway right I’ll probably roll the funds back into BABA, BIDU, JD PDD & OZON options spread out in various strikes and expirations between June 21 & June 2023 if the China stocks are still way down after this play.

2021-04-20 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"CLOV daily volume is 2 times free float and 10 times the average daily volume It happened on Friday, and it happened today again. **Daily** CLOV **volume** above **230 million shares**. Available **Free Float** of CLOV is **109 million** shares. The **average daily volume** over the past 3 months has been **23.6 million shares**. We are are experiencing **10x average volume**!

https://preview.redd.it/s9t4dua587u61.png?width=1758&format=png&auto=webp&s=f181af59a503967370059a3ec08ed8fbd4d946a1

Now what is even more interesting is that not all of the free float shares are actually ""free"" because Chamath and his buddy Ian own significant number of shares which are locked under lock-up agreement.

https://preview.redd.it/v9os2ztb97u61.jpg?width=1324&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3b655e85966f06d425367687beb63aafa94640c4

This leaves us with approx. **60 million shares** up for trading assuming Vanguard wants to flip their shares (*unlikely but let's assume*).

Dividing today's volume of **230 million** with **60 million** gives us **3.83**. This means that **every available CLOV share exchanged hands today almost 4 times**!  


Huge volume + huge exchange of shares + relatively flat price = short ladder attacks  


Here is the definition:  
*To execute a short ladder attack, two bearish hedge funds trade shares of stock back and forth between each other at lower and lower prices in order to create the illusion that the price is dropping and scare owners into panic selling.*

My theory is that whoever is shorting CLOV is trying to suppress the price until the hype dies down and hopefully gives them an easier exit from their short positions.

Since an emergency paid article on Bloomberg bashing Chamath on a Saturday at 9:00 a.m. did not work as expected considering CLOV went up today on a market red day, they have to think of something to prevent things from getting out of control.  


[Bloomberg is reminding us about SEC investigation, even though Clover has been awarded to operate in new states few weeks ago.](https://preview.redd.it/7dine2lwa7u61.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7296f1fed7eff640158220f1cb1bff8b95e57a02)

2021-04-19 20:04:12,wallstreetbets,"Said it elsewhere, as the financials are, this is not a long term play. Right now they have maybe 6 months of runway. They are likely going to have to take on debt or issue shares this year.

However, it definitely has the makings of a short play. High short interest, low delta options with lots of OI, and someone has been accumulating shares. It also has a possible huge catalyst on 5/20, with earnings coming out. 

Looking into that more, they only need to make about 5% margin on premiums versus claims to cut their losses in half and get 9-12 months of runway. That would be a huge catalyst. I think it's entirely possible for them to pull that off with covid calming more.

Would take about 10% margin before I would think this is viable as a long term play."

Please shut up with this QAnon caliber nonsense.

> Here is the definition:
> To execute a short ladder attack, two bearish hedge funds trade shares of stock back and forth between each other at lower and lower prices in order to create the illusion that the price is dropping and scare owners into panic selling.

No. This has been debunked multiple times. This is not how the market works, nor is it possible for two entities to collaborate like this to drive down the price. 

Your own ""DD"" about volume debunks it if you take 2 seconds to think about it.

I get it, you don't want to be a bagholder, you want this thing to moon, but lying and making shit up to drive hype IS NOT THE WAY. 

Please be a better person than that.


Here's a beautiful little thought experiment. Let's say you and I want to collude to drive the price down. 

You offer the share for $10. I buy it for $10 (because I was lucky enough to get it for $10 from you and not anyone else offering it for $10). This is crazy hard to do once given the thousands of shares being traded every second btw, let alone dozens or hundreds of times repeatedly.

So then I offer it for $9.99 and you bid $9.99. Same thing. Maybe you get it, or maybe the shares are now in the ether out of our control bought up by someone who got their order for $9.99 in before you.

No...fractional penny orders that ""retail can't enter"" like 9.998 don't help us.

First because who gives a shit about 10ths or 100ths of a penny? Swap shares back and forth all you want, eventually we need to drop it down to 9.98 or 9.97 and someone who is not you or me will get the order. 

Why? Because that's how markets work. Look at the L2 order book depth and how orders are paired up. 

I get orders filled for fractions of a cent all the time even though I never enter orders w/ more than 2 decimals of precision. If I put in a limit buy order for 9.98 and the best (lowest) ask is 9.9736 at that time, it will fill at that price if my order was submitted before the evil collaborator colluding to bid 9.9736. If there are hundreds or thousands of people bidding 9.98, the chances of your 4-digit bid getting hit for your shares is minuscule.

It works the other direction too. The market will always try to get you the best price available. So even though you're offering 9.9736, someone might sell shares at market or set a limit sell that hits your bid. You got their shares and they got your money.

Either way you're leaking shares or cash to the rest of the market and have NO control over who you buy or sell shares from."

Depends what your goal is. I've got my serious investments which i keep diversified, boring, and safe. 

Then I have play money that I toss at whatever amuses me. The idea behind CLOV is that some people might be shorting it excessively, meaning that it could be an investment opportunity if the short blows up on them. some people here are speculating it could go up instead. Who's right? No idea, but it amuses me to toss some money at it. If I'm wrong, oh well. I've lost more money in Vegas.

There are points in trading days where whale like investors absolutely clear the order books in either direction. And of course the short ladder attacks would leak shares but it can still accomplish the goal of dramatically lowering the price quickly.

There is really no reason or way to execute a short ladder on AAPL or AMZN, it only really happens when a stock with an obvious short interest is getting squeezed. Of course, during a squeeze the price rises so dramatically that a sudden drop gives the impression ""this is over"" instead of just buying the dip like you would when AAPL dips on no news. So the attack can definitely work in theory for a GME or a CLOV, especially when there is so much on the line for the shorts. And hey maybe the actors doing the attack believe in the squeeze and want to get in at a lower price, but usually I would say it's a last ditch effort to kill the squeeze.

I'm not saying I'm a big Short Ladder guy but saying it doesn't or cannot happen is not completely correct"
2021-04-19 20:39:43,wallstreetbets,"I agree about leaking shares if someone big is scooping them on dips. But if they are not, it could be used as a scare tactic to give an impression that price is dropping and there is no squeeze.

Either way, what is your theory? How do you explain almost 4 times the volume of the available float?"

2021-04-19 20:20:23,wallstreetbets, A word in earnest is as good as a speech.
2021-04-19 20:39:24,wallstreetbets,"They could do that on so-called ""dark pools"" (which I hesitate to even mention because the anon crowd loves to conspiracy theory that shit too), but that would not impact market price because the transaction did not occur on the open market and wouldn't be reported or recorded there.

It would be a private transaction, and since it's not participating in the bid/ask process it doesn't effect anything.

And big transactions like that do occur all the time. Like when execs sell their shares, for example, they file a plan and paperwork and lock in a specific price. If Vanguard wants to buy $1M of stock from CEO X that's their own business. It's only if Vanguard then dumps all that stock on the market that it would lower the price."
2021-04-19 20:56:39,wallstreetbets,"Everything you've said basically amounts to hand waving magical thinking, though. 

Extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof. And the burden of proof is always on the person making the claim, not the person rejecting it.

I've yet to see a single shred of evidence presented by anybody claiming ""short ladder attacks"" is an actual thing. Conjecture and speculation is not evidence.

People a) lack perspective on the scope and operation of the market and b) like seeing pictures in clouds"
2021-04-19 20:46:17,wallstreetbets,Thank you for the comment. I'm curious how else can you explain daily volume almost 4 times available float? What drives this?
2021-04-19 20:52:11,wallstreetbets,"No, it doesn't need to be someone ""big"" scooping them up on dips to prevent an ""attack"". Your own DD is talking about massive volume. Massive or regular, it doesn't really matter, the market itself is the ""big"" thing scooping up shares. 

I don't need a ""theory"" to explain a sideways moving market. It's genuinely not unnatural or unusual or unexpected for a security to have high volume and trade sideways. It's entirely legit for the market to battle and argue over the value of something and have it trade within a range.

And it's not like it was perfectly flat. It swung between 9.17 and 10.57, just because *you* think it should go a certain way, or don't like it when it goes up and then people take profits doesn't mean it's a conspiracy.

Volume greater than float also isn't that meaningful, it just indicates volatility and uncertainty and enthusiasm for the security. Day traders and swing traders love shit like that and help drive it. The more it moves the more they trade it, the more they can make."
2021-04-19 21:03:14,wallstreetbets,"Still doesn't matter. AON, IOC, and FOK are available to (some) retail traders. I can place FOK on etrade for example. Those orders are still subjected to the order book.

A FOK order for example will try to chew through the order book, and it doesn't matter if it's for 9.99 or 9.7346, there are thousands of other market participants constantly submitting orders to the book for 10's and 100's of thousands of shares worth of volume. It might get killed, or might get filled, but you have absolutely no control over whose corresponding orders are used to fill yours.

If you set a FOK for 10k shares at 9.9123, it will consume as many shares at qualifying prices from as many submitted orders as needed in a first come first serve basis. Anything anybody has submitted that is siting in the book will be used up.

HFT can see the book too, so they can jump in in less than a microsecond to poach while the order is alive for however many seconds. To algorithms a FOK is an eternity. It's not just time of submission that matters, but price. Better price = you go to the front of the line, even if it's by 0.001 cents."

Lot's in the community have speculated $CLOV is being used as a distraction to get apes to sell $GME and $AMC, but it seems against the interest of all the short sellers to do that, if it's a different group of competing short sellers that'd make sense

This is all wildly speculative

Just got to buy more $GME and $AMC to go with your $CLOV...diversify your squeezes"
2021-04-20 10:41:23,wallstreetbets,"From the accounts that have been posting, I'm completely inclined to agree. There's been an insane number of relatively new accounts pushing for CLOV. Cramer praised it and the only tweet of his on the front page is the one on MVIS. Very few people are actually pointing out the obvious or the posts are getting deleted."
2021-04-20 13:48:08,wallstreetbets,"It’s the opposite. Vanguard is short on GME, yet long here in CLOV."

2021-04-19 20:05:53,wallstreetbets,Who knows
2021-04-19 20:45:12,wallstreetbets,True. Just further shows what a shitshow all this is. I knew the second S3 partners published that that Citadel has a long position.
2021-04-19 23:33:57,wallstreetbets,This is the way.
2021-04-19 21:36:25,wallstreetbets,Nop...Longhorn
2021-04-19 21:10:11,wallstreetbets,I’d buy it for $3.50 and give it to a bum. Bums need love too
2021-04-19 23:18:53,wallstreetbets,Bearsfucking. Sounds fun.
2021-04-19 23:27:51,wallstreetbets,Sounds like a South Park episode.
2021-04-19 22:29:49,wallstreetbets,I promise you that’s not true. It may not be as vengeful as some may think but if their is even a hint of blood in the water they are sure to exploit another hedge funds position. Ironic that the current golden meme stock of GME citadel is short but the previous memelord was TSLA where citadel was long and Blackrock was short. I’m not suggesting that’s why it’s gme in one vs the other but it happens all the time.
2021-04-19 20:54:44,wallstreetbets,"I would agree they may not be deliberately fighting each other, but you think if there was money to be made they’d stick up for each other and miss out?"
2021-04-20 04:20:20,wallstreetbets,Huh? Money is money. Where is money? Other hedge funds. This is a dog-eat-dog market.
2021-04-20 03:55:38,wallstreetbets,Doing this sounds exactly \_like\_ hedging to me.
2021-04-19 20:47:49,wallstreetbets,It's a really small position for them in my opinion. Plus if Citadel had a focus on this I doubt they would order Bloomberg to shit on the stock and try to calm down the squueze.

2021-04-19 20:57:44,wallstreetbets,How much are they paying you chief? 🤡
2021-04-19 20:58:20,wallstreetbets,IV is over 200% on those contracts. Dirt cheap in dollar value yes but premium is actually very high on a relative basis. You'll need a big move in share price to breakeven unless IV goes up even more.
2021-04-20 11:37:31,wallstreetbets,How's this working out for you?
2021-04-19 20:37:55,wallstreetbets,It's not a hedge lmao.

2021-04-20 00:52:07,wallstreetbets,"Yeah you can manually calculate that stuff with the Greeks, yea adding The gamma to the delta each day, subtracting theta, etc.  I use www.optionsprofitcalculator.com it says this if you put in my calls:

$CLOV Detail: $12 on 20th Apr 2021
close (selling if it hits 12$ tomorrow)

Trades to close position:  
sell 21st May $30.00 Call	
100x100	$0.60
$6000.00 (my total position value w/ gain)

Entry cost	$-2800.00 (my cost)

2021-04-20 06:10:45,wallstreetbets,"I will say, I heard the same shit in February/March about GME too. That the squeeze was over and it was destined to stay at the $40-50 range it had fallen to. 2 weeks later? It was above $300 again. One of the best decisions I made was to ignore that FUD at the lows and invest.

Point being, never bet against GME, though I agree, I don’t think you were saying it was over in your initial post."
2021-04-19 20:35:07,wallstreetbets,Not overly sensitive bud just saying the dd on clove is dogshit cus it is. Get some puts on gme then since ur so confident it’s going down lmao

2021-04-19 23:15:59,wallstreetbets,"yeah I intend to hold the shares even if the options dont work out, at least for the short term, up to 2-3 weeks, the gains will be similar to an option play since its 38k in equity lol"

2021-04-20 07:53:08,wallstreetbets,"They're changing their entire strategy to selling online. What are they going to sell? Playstation and Xbox are cutting out the middle man and making it so people can only buy from them exclusively. So no Xbox and Playstation sales for Gamestop which Gamestop has relied on for a long time to make up the majority of their revenue. They will need to make up for the loss of Xbox and Playstation game revenue... via PC games? What else are they going to sell, computer parts and merchandise? Yeah, Gamestop will undergo a complete transformation from the ground up and beat Steam and Newegg all in under the 1 year that people are expecting."
2021-04-19 20:42:15,wallstreetbets,"I mean they claimed it wouldn't stay above 10 because of push back, it reached 10 twice and dropped both times so someone was right in their predictions within the DD before today even started.

You say you're not overly sensitive but your overarching point was that GME isnt finished and that i should stop talking like it is. When infact its obvious i never was.

So you resort to the man child option, and call anything else that **COULD BE** dog shit, cause it challenges what *you* feel is right. Grow the fuck up kiddo.

You'll get daddies trust fund back on GME one day, maybe. Considering brick and mortar stores are slowly becoming a thing of the past lol."

Like i fucking said, when a reddit makes it on the news, it draws attention to it, i promise you most of these ""bots"" you say they are, are just new to WSB because they fucking heard about GME so they came here looking for another. (myself included)  


Its not a distraction, its human nature, ykno, greed?"

A) An adult with the name blubcum. That resorts to stalking and digging up dirt on peoples reddit profiles when you are wrong. Which is very immature   
or   
B) A 16 year old who is openly perverted, you had to go through my profile, i had to read your name. Who thinks its cooler to call people mad than just apologize for saying some ignorant shit.  


Either way, I'd never rape a chick, i wont deny my sexual fantasies are out there and im a bit of a deviant, but i have respect for other humans. Ontop of that, my perversion isn't really a factor here any more than your idiotic middle school name is."
2021-04-19 21:35:47,wallstreetbets,"I like how ur trying to infer I’m some creepy stalker in ur first point to try a cover up how you like to rape girls (maybe guys too, no judgement). And it’s not stalking if I click on ur profile and the first thing I see is that😂
Also I am not wrong and why would I ever apologize to you when u started with the insults lol."
2021-04-19 23:21:17,wallstreetbets,"woah god damn guys were talking about Clover Health company not rape!  please chill and just buy clov tomorrow, thanks."
2021-04-19 21:47:56,wallstreetbets,"You put words in someone's mouth and expect them not to get defensive? Ontop of that i actually finished off with trying to tell you how fucking pointless my fantasies are in this argument just like your name is not important.

You may not be wrong about GME, but you're wrong about what i said. I get now you're immature as fuck, but you need to notice the wording. Or perhaps look up the definition of what *ANOTHER* means. Incase you're to lazy(we know you didn't do much homework considering you type like i used to when i was just starting highschool):  ""***used to refer to an additional person or thing of the same type as one already mentioned or known about; one more; a further.""***

So its safe to concur you where wrong, because i never said GME was over, that is until you implied i did.

And in fact if you actually used your eyes, you'd see I was advocating for something called consensual non consent, the first thing I see is how I was replying to someone saying they where gonna dox someone about how its a felony and wrong etc etc. So, not rape, if the chick is into it just as much as i am it isn't rape, cause that is what rape is right? Sex without consent.

I know it might be out there for you to think that some chicks are into it, but then again you probably are a virgin with how hard you're tryna die on this hill."
2021-04-19 22:04:04,wallstreetbets,"Running ur shit through grammarly doesn’t make u smart. And as for dying on a hill, ur the one writing a essay man. Call it a fantasy all u want but u should get some help because you are obviously delusional. Maybe some anger management courses aswell"
2021-04-19 22:08:56,wallstreetbets,"Grammarly lol?   


I mean if you go through and find other arguments with petty assholes since you enjoy looking through my profile so much, this is how i type in a argument on reddit and i mean i believe its called email etiquette Look at that last paragraph i wrote you, and notice the lower case ""I""s that's grammatically incorrect IIRC.  


As for being delusional, im not, BDSM? Sadism? Masochism? They all play into consensual non consent. Go look it up on pornhub. Shit wait nvm, you are supposed to be 18 to go on that site."
2021-04-19 22:18:39,wallstreetbets,"Lol  I’ve never got someone this mad with such little effort but I’m done now, sweet dreams little rapist"

2021-04-20 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"A 14 year-old's Take on Algorithmic Stock Trading - TradeAlgo Hey r/wallstreetbets, I've been working on a stock trading algorithm these past couple months. My interest in trading began this January and since I'm lazy as shit and I know how to code, I decided to code myself something that would trade for me.

For this project, I used Python and the TD Ameritrade API. I will begin by saying that the TD Ameritrade API is absolute garbage and you should use something else if you want to try something like this.

The code for TradeAlgo can be found here: [https://github.com/4pz/TradeAlgo](https://github.com/4pz/TradeAlgo)

TradeAlgo uses web scraping to pull a list of stocks which are predicted to rise already. After the list is scraped, each symbol is then checked to validate if they match the parameters set in the code. (These parameters are created by me after extensive research on how to predict a rising stock)

After this, the total balance of your TD Ameritrade account is pulled using the TD Ameritrade API and your total balance is split among the stocks which matched the set parameters. You can change how much money from your account is allocated to be used with the algorithm by changing the balance variable to the desired amount.

Finally, the buy function is called to execute all orders with a trailing stop loss to ensure minimal losses.

I've also included a way to only see a list of recommended stocks without actually buying them so if you want to make your own educated decisions after seeing what TradeAlgo advises, you can do that.

**Make sure to check out the repositories ReadMe for detailed setup and usage instructions!**

*If you have a GitHub account and can star the repository, I'd appreciate it.*

2021-04-19 21:00:27,wallstreetbets,Am 7 years old and can confirm this is def legit
2021-04-19 23:48:15,wallstreetbets,"Others have mentioned, but before you (or anyone) tosses money at this, you *really* need to backtest it. Ironically, unless you go with a canned backtesting framework that will be *by far* more challenging than coding the initial algorithm. 

*When* this fails to perform adequately, don't be discouraged. Start tweaking, and maybe consider adding some new modules to it -[RSI](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rsi.asp) and [MACD](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/macd.asp) are probably good ones to start with. They should be pretty easy to implement in Python."
2021-04-19 21:26:21,wallstreetbets,What part of the code tells it to transfer all funds out of everyone’s account into your account ? That would be my first priority if I was giving out free scripts

2021-04-19 21:04:57,wallstreetbets,You hardcoded your own windows path. Try to use %AppData% if you want it to only work on windows or sth like that.
2021-04-19 21:27:46,wallstreetbets,"So.. In terms of what it chooses to trade and all that I think there is work to do.  But hey In software development this is perfectly normal the functionality is mostly there now it's time to polish it, start gathering data for what works and doesn't to make money and go from there.  
My experience is that most of the time this happens you spend time building it out and the functionality does what you want, but what it produces isn't really what you want so time to go fix those algo's to make some money.

Good luck in your project for 14 it's pretty neat!"

2021-04-20 09:19:46,wallstreetbets,"Hey /u/Simp0le, nice work. I work in electronic trading and have worked for a few different HFT's and options firms. This is a great start, especially for a teenager. Python is a great language we use for a lot of non-trading tasks. System management/configuration/etc. I have seen a few trading apps written directly in python, but not often. Still, programming experience is good.

If you want to make an eventual career out of this, you're going to want to focus on C programming on Linux. After that, Java on Linux is popular as well. But again we all use Python (and bash, but that's a given I guess).

Maybe also the FIX protocol: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_electronic_trading_protocols

Solid understanding of various sources of system latency and how to mitigate them, process isolation, cgroups, how an x86_64 processor works, and a very very in depth understanding of the TCP/IP protocol as well. If you can write your own TCP stack, knowing all of the Linux syscalls, all good things to know.

Good work."
2021-04-19 20:19:17,wallstreetbets,"Nice, maybe there should be a setup script to change variables such as "" f = open(r""C:\\Users\\Vinay\\Desktop\\tradealgo\\getData\\access\_token.txt"", ""r"") ""

Risk engine I'm not sure, I doubt their implementations are the same or even remotely close. More than likely the only thing happening is a check to see if the trade is valid for your account. Then again if 200ms is too high latency to trade on for your strategies you almost certainly should be working with a much more highly available and scalable service anyway, and all those cost a lot of money. I use this API to make my trading only need a keyboard, I'm less interested in latency than simple convenience and speed of moving between symbols, strikes, expirations, and calculating risk or prices for my tolerance. For me I'm just turning what used to be maybe 20 to 30 seconds of work into about 3 to 5"

Everyone I know in comp sci/electrical engineering who already did some programming discovered their interest early and had an easier time in the first classes. In fact, even in later years and when working I still notice advantages on the more programming-heavy tasks.

It's not like he's learning the wrong muscle memory. There is literally no downside to programming at an early age."

---

What is it with loser ex-mods hijacking the WSB name and using crypto to scam people?

People keep posting a press release about an ""official"" WallStreetBets distributed app. (Aka, a crypto pyramid scheme) 

Nothing could be further from the truth. We are strongly anti-monetization. This scam has nothing to do with us. 

This is yet another attempt for the pathetic and disgraced founder (removed by Reddit Admins in 2020) to cash out on a subreddit whose only contributions allegedly include:

* Phishing our users

* Attempting to run a shitty paid mentoring group

* Selling advertising on the subreddit

* Trying to turn options trading into an esport

* Selling WSB out to movie producers

* Attempting to change our logo to some god awful abomination

Don't throw away your money on this scam. 

Throw it away on OTM FDs instead.

But he seems like the predator type and will exploit weaknesses.

I actually knew a guy that looks like he does and got caught killing bunnies in a pet store, no joke true story.

But you've got a brand which isn't necessarily a bad thing bc you control the narrative, pun intended.

WSB has always attracted talent and intelligent people who are like the smartest kids in a room full of retards but better. I remember one mod, fuzzy something, works as an SEC compliance lawyer or something. A really bright guy. Either way I'll bet there's tons of talent like that in the sub. People who work in PR firms or who know people that could be helpful. And I'm sure good people from Reddit would rally to support you guys. There is something a little touched about throwing money at FDs hoping for a payday. And it's awesome.

A negative 10-2 spread has predicted every recession from 1955 to 2018, but has occurred 6-24 months before the recession occurring, and is thus seen as a far-leading indicator. The 10-2 spread reached a high of 2.91% in 2011, and went as low as -2.41% in 1980."""

https://preview.redd.it/z796s6xkr5u61.png?width=1604&format=png&auto=webp&s=3a6eb12b832300c27abb8842251b28125735c1ba

You should check out [my first post on Coinbase + trading volume](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mr1za6/coin_150b_570share_price_target/). Its shorter, does back of the envelope math, and offers a primer for this denser analysis. It introduces the claim that trading volume has entered new 'phases' of elevated activity \*despite entering and exiting bull cycles\*

In this follow-up post, I perform quantitative analysis on trading volume to potentially forecast profit. With that being said, most of these numbers are purely for reference as the analysis does not accurately capture all of Coinbase's revenue streams. Moreover, estimates around volume contractions make some firm assumptions that can blow up in my face.

&#x200B;

edit: ""volume"" is in reference to Coinbase's exchange (trading pairs that cannot be named). Volume does *not* refer to the actual volume of $COIN shares

# TLDR:

* I target a conservative 50 forward PE Ratio, given Paypal's 59.52 forward PE Ratio and Square's 204 forward PE Ratio
* If coinbase trading volume contracts half as strong as typical volume-contractions, **$556/share is 50x PE**
* If coinbase trading volume continues for the remainder of 2021, $800/share is 50x PE
* If coinbase trading volume contracts -36% (unlikely given institutional presence) $313/share is 50x PE

&#x200B;

My data source is cryptowatch that offered awesome pricing. And the analysis is available for free, under the MIT License: [https://colab.research.google.com/drive/14Q69lBlYzBafhcZOpOHyfwTiQ2UzecOy?usp=sharing](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/14Q69lBlYzBafhcZOpOHyfwTiQ2UzecOy?usp=sharing)

* **Charts are interactive**
* I will post updates and re-runs at the end of each quarter to see if my forecasts are worthwhile

# Methods:

* exchanges: Coinbase Pro, Kraken, Gemini, Binance, Binance US
   * I picked the exchanges that had substantial volume and were open to US customers. I included Binance as a way to get a temperature on the global trading activity.
* pairs:  (see the Colab notebook for the list, the names wont make it past automod)
   * I picked the largest trading pairs (by USD volume) on Coinbase Pro. While the smaller pairs do not influence the trade volume substantially, it provides a bit of a gauge when new trading pairs become available on Coinbase.
* **>> PHASES <<**: A new volume-phase is entered when the next 30-day average daily volume (ADV) exceeds the previous 30-day average daily volume by 120%. A phase contracts when the next 30-day ADV falls -45% compared to the previous 30-day ADV
   * these numbers are arbitrary and were chosen as they seem to model the volume-phases reasonably well without picking up the noise
* **Limitations**:
   * Coinbase Pro as a proxy for Coinbase, the main app's trading volume could also be substantial
   * Trading pairs are a curated list and do not capture volume in totality
   * Coinbase's fee changes remain unchanged [Source](https://twitter.com/SquawkCNBC/status/1382279472599162880)

# USD Daily Trading Volume by Exchange

# 'Global' USD Daily Trading Volume + Phases

https://preview.redd.it/nm7p04lor5u61.png?width=1604&format=png&auto=webp&s=28b1136683aa37e592f7641b378af8cc4dbb89f1

* 'Global' as in across all exchanges and all pairs, mentioned above
* The current Jan 2021 breakout observes an explosive volume phase, and is the source behind Coinbase's eye-popping Q1 $1.8B revenue and $800M profit
* July 2019 will provide some guidance on the January 2021 phase. At the time, a record-high volume phase is followed by a contraction that is sustained and higher than the prior long-term volume phase (\~Janurary 2019).
* It would be misleading to not comment on January 2018's phase contraction. The favorable explanation is July 2018 volume phase is \~4 times larger than Apr 2017 phase. More so, the January 2018 cycle had 'altcoins' flaring to record high valuations, and are not entirely captured in the trading pairs provided. Additionally, the 2018 cycle likely did not have substantial institutional support that we are witnessing today

# Coinbase Pro vs. Gemini

https://preview.redd.it/1d1gvbmqr5u61.png?width=1604&format=png&auto=webp&s=e3eb44ff085323d26a7b460a7955387b5718f47c

* This was a byproduct discovery, but Gemini's most recent trade volume seems to match the 2018 cycle. This to me implies that Gemini's user base has not grown aggressively as Coinbase's or its that institutional investors/traders have really warmed up to Coinbase. Bullish.

# Volume Phase Breakout + Contraction

How much does average daily  volume change between phases?

|Exchange|Average Phase Change|Average Phase Breakout|Average Phase Contraction|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Global|68.17%|157.4%|\-29.17%|
|Coinbase|54.16%|121.81%|\-36.04%|
|Binance|81.53%|152.4%|\-12.95%|
|Kraken|54.53%|129.3%|\-35.19%|
|Binance US|104.01%|148.87%|\-52.97%|
|Gemini|67.96%|178.26%|\-32.31%|

* Average Phase Change: the average % change between phases (regardless of up or down)
* Average Phase Breakout: the average % change when a new phase is *higher* than the previous
* Average Phase Contraction: the average % change when a new phase is *lower* than the previous

* To confirm that Q1 (and Q2 estimates) can be used for Q3 and Q4, I perform a simple seasonality check. For each month since 2017: what is the average daily volume
* The Colab notebook contains the sum of USD trading volume by month
* There's no immediate explanation for why different parts of the year would have increased trading activity, therefore I assume that trading volume does not exhibit seasonality.

# Forecasts and Price Targets

* Assumes that operational costs are $1 billion (Q1 2021 $1.8 Billion, 800 Million Profit)
* Volume contraction in Q2 is carried out for the remainder of the year (except for Neutral-Bear case)

**Using Coinbase Historical Volume Contraction**

|Case|Volume Contraction|2021 Profit Forecast|Share Price, if 50x PE|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Bull|0%|$3.2 billion|$800.00|
|Neutral|\-18.02%|$2.23 billion|$556.74|
|Bear|\-36.04%|$1.25 billion|$313.49|

**Using Global Historical Volume Contraction**

|Case|Volume Contraction|2021 Profit Forecast|Share Price, if 50x PE|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Bull|0%|$3.2 billion|$800.00|
|Neutral|\-14.585%|$2.4 billion|$603.11|
|**Neutral-Bear**|**-14.585% each Quarter**|**$1.77  billion**|**$443.09**|
|Bear|\-29.17%|$1.62 billion|$406.23|

* Bull Case: the volume does not contract at all for the remainder of 2021
* Neutral Case: the volume contracts half as strong as typical contractions, and holds for the remainder of 2021
* **Neutral-Bear Case: the volume contracts -14.5% quarter over quarter (Q2's volume is -14.5% over Q1, and Q3's volume is -14.5% over Q2, etc.)**
* Bear Case: the volume contracts as much as typical contractions

*Rough* formula:

`share price = ((1.8 + (1.8 * Q2-contraction) + (1.8 * Q3-contraction) + (1.8 * Q4-contraction) - 4) / 0.2 * 50)`

* `1.8` $1.8 Billion revenue Q1
* `contraction` 0.8 = -20% volume contraction
* `4` subtract operational costs. Q1: $800 million profit off of $1.8 billion revenue, therefore \~$1 billion operational costs each quarter
* `0.2` 200 million outstanding shares
* `50` 50x PE ratio target

# Closing Thoughts (Apr 2021)

The USD volume is exceptionally noisy and fluctuates aggressively. Tweaking the parameters can and will show an entirely different forecast. No one will know how, when, and where this volume-phase will end up; therefore approximating Coinbase's revenue via exchange volume has substantial risk.

But with increased institutional adoption, balance sheet reporting, and favorable discourse around cryptocurrencies, my own impressions believe that we haven't seen the volume-phase 'top' and I believe the subsequent contraction won't be extreme as previously observed. When comparing Coinbase against its competitors, its doing well to continue its growth. Additionally, this analysis entirely ignores other coins, trading pairs, and the additional revenue streams expected by Coinbase. Despite the possibility of a strong volume-phase contraction, I believe this analysis provides a somewhat incomplete picture and does not factor in other bullish cases for Coinbase.

In the words of Thanos, if we take each case as equally-probable, ""perfectly-balanced, as all things should be"", the expected value per share (average of each case) is between $556.74 - $603.11 (neutral case). I believe taking on risk head-first is a ""small price to pay for salvation""

2021-04-19 20:01:31,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the read. Having said that I think that if bitcoin farts this will plummet accordingly tbh.
2021-04-20 01:31:49,wallstreetbets,If Cathie buys I buy! 🚀🚀🚀
2021-04-20 04:01:52,wallstreetbets,"You are using technical analysis on a stock that entered the market a week ago, and using the incredible volatility of the first day of trading on this stock to forecast a bull case. My plan is to ease into affordable puts far otm and far out in time until it becomes my biggest position. I suspect this is an opportunistic cash grab from underinformed overleveraged investment hacks, and that it will quickly become an unmanaged business with a long slow value decay until it's a moldy pile propping up the corner leg of the shipping manager's desk in a dank closet-office hidden somewhere within the NY subway complex."
2021-04-19 20:54:23,wallstreetbets,Bro I have 200 shares and I didn’t give enough of a fuck to do a single piece of DD. Saw it dip and bought in
2021-04-19 20:22:03,wallstreetbets,"I basically gave my wife (via her boyfriend) these same projections. I see CB at 500+ easy with movement into 700+ end of year with future, bigger deals/partners going to them vs less reputable exchanges. 
I have zero DD to back this up. Just a crypto ape who prefers green over red crayons."
2021-04-19 20:01:02,wallstreetbets,"Very thorough work! Take my karma, how many research hours have you invested?"
2021-04-19 20:50:28,wallstreetbets,Thank you. yoloed 9k @350 last week just cause I'm retarded.
2021-04-19 21:12:45,wallstreetbets,My 10 shares @ ~$360 needed this DD
2021-04-19 22:45:49,wallstreetbets,"Love this DD! There was the prediction that COIN would go to $500 on opening day but instinctively I didn't buy into that theory since I think that the psychology of traders still kicks in.  It was impressive however that even before opening the stock had jumped from $250 to $379 which I think took the wind out of many day/retail traders and put it just out of range for the ""masses"" to buy! 

Just some thoughts

I do like that you proposed the Bear and Neutral Bear scenarios to balance the bias

Awesome post!"
2021-04-19 23:00:36,wallstreetbets,"""quantitative analysis"" wtf we got quants now?

Before joining WSB, OP counted cards for the MIT blackjack team."
2021-04-19 23:20:34,wallstreetbets,Is a significant decrease in bitcoin value (>70% correction) going to affect the value of coinbase directly? I assume they will collect less fees per transaction if bitcoin price is lower.
2021-04-19 23:29:02,wallstreetbets,You lost me at your 50 P/E target. COIN demand like all crypto is based entirely on confidence which is sky high right now. Once it comes down a notch so will their valuation and growth.
2021-04-19 20:56:10,wallstreetbets,"I look at it every day to see if they have made options available. At the end the day, they should let me gamble my life savings."
2021-04-19 23:28:25,wallstreetbets,This is the elephant in the room.
2021-04-19 21:37:33,wallstreetbets,My 22 @ $402 needed it more.

2021-04-20 07:32:40,wallstreetbets,Weaponized autism
2021-04-19 20:52:37,wallstreetbets,"When I did my research, I thought price wouldn't be justified above 300, but I still decided to buy cause I thought trading volume was gonna carry prices into the 500 and I was gonna cash out and wait till it came back down to get back in. Now I'm down here holding the bag."
2021-04-19 20:54:43,wallstreetbets,I think closer to Q2 earnings is when numbers are gonna start looking good. For now I'm just buying as much as i can till then.
2021-04-19 21:19:35,wallstreetbets,"You and me both, my friend.  Let's have a whiskey."
2021-04-20 12:38:50,wallstreetbets,Yamazaki on the rocks. It's on you.
2021-04-20 16:00:11,wallstreetbets,"But looking at the options, it seems like the most conservative ones expect a price rise of 20 percent."
2021-04-19 21:39:41,wallstreetbets,I'm about to start taking data science classes just for the fuck of it and have some cash laying around. Do you think that shit will help understanding trading?
2021-04-19 21:25:28,wallstreetbets,"But they don’t collect on swaps between coins, unless it’s to a stable coin.  Great DD and thanks for your work/recreation!"
2021-04-19 22:23:17,wallstreetbets,"When BTC price goes down, people lose interest and Coinbase demand goes down"
2021-04-20 00:39:21,wallstreetbets,"Interesting take, but we can relate it to the past -  when BTC crashed around 70% in 2018 the revenues fell 50% so that would be the correlation I expect to happen if crypto crashes. (Fun to think that Coinbase has a 100 PE for just Q1 and Square has a PE of 200 for the whole of 2020 😂)"
2021-04-20 15:57:00,wallstreetbets,I think so too. Although I bought 30 shares at 380. I believe we'll be in the bear market for another month.
2021-04-19 22:09:43,wallstreetbets,"Of course, but you're going to need to gain the trading knowledge to come up with the variables to feed your data science algorithms."
2021-04-19 22:21:58,wallstreetbets,"yes and no, data science classes will teach you how to work with tabular data (i.e. time series) which I heavily do in this DD to get global daily trading volume etc.

data science classes won't really teach you the indicators (PE/PS ratios), balance sheets, etc. coinbase was easy to do DD since the trade data was super accessible. for example things like apple's iPhone sales numbers aren't really available on a daily basis"
2021-04-19 21:15:02,wallstreetbets,"I think if crypto tanks COIN would be fine, it may even rise due to a possible influx of people continuing, if not increasing their purchasing of crypto.  Hardcore crypto heads love a dip."
2021-04-19 22:11:08,wallstreetbets,For sure. I'm taking valuation classes at the moment. Should be done with the first semester in 27 days.
2021-04-19 22:24:15,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I'm already taking classes in valuation... I just wanted to earn a bachelor degree in data to couple it with valuation over the summer since I have the time and energy to do do. But I see what you mean."

2021-04-20 01:21:57,wallstreetbets,"Earnings will be good for mortgage side, but hopefully we will see some growth in auto and personal. That would give it a nice boost.

Low SI now though, so you are hoping the market stops freaking out about what interest rates will do to loans."

It’s sad to say this happens all of the time when a subreddit is overrun with users who all want to participate in the meme. Once the moderators moderate and tidy up the mess, the kids who didn't get their fill throw a poo-flinging tantrum because they cant just dominate an unrelated subreddit with their own little joke that's more than beating a dead horse.

They demand validation and attention. Otherwise, they'd just scoot over to whatever new, dedicated sub or thread has been provided. The joke just isn't as much fun for them when their only audience is each other. The dedicated sub becomes a ghost town.

Which pretty much solidifies the theory."

   - After this announcement the company reaffirmed their guidance

   - Price cratered essentially at opening bell and did not recover all day.  If it was significantly oversold, surprised it did not rebound by EOD/AH, though."

 “I feel angry I feel helpless
Want to change the world yeah
I feel violent I feel alone
Don't try and change my mind no.” 

The lyrics allude to a person that is caught in the throes of revolution; both within himself and for society. He is going against the herd, against conformity, and finds himself disillusioned and in despair through this process.

Despite all this, the overarching theme of the song is to overcome your own inner helplessness and become at one with your self and your brothers."

2021-04-19 22:03:35,wallstreetbets,Maybe next time after you burn the house down hire someone to install counter tops that don’t look like they were drawn by a five year old in crayon
2021-04-19 22:07:09,wallstreetbets,Cutting it out will suck and likely look worse in the end. Can you lower the stove so whatever is sticking up falls under that counter ridge? I can't really tell much from that pic.
2021-04-19 22:08:51,wallstreetbets,"After reading every one else’s comments, I’m assuming you’re burning your house down as the solution"
2021-04-19 22:09:12,wallstreetbets,"That pic is garbage but from what I see it's just like formica-like countertop behind the stove and it's cut to accomodate the stove but it's warped?

You could probably get a sanding block and a 6 pack of beer and sand it flat if you want.  If it's granite you'd def need a saw.

Also, your oven should have levelers on each corner, little spinny height adjustors, you could raise the oven a half inch or so with them and see if it raises the oven to the point of obstructing view.

If it looks more complex than sawing it or sanding it smooth you might need to bring a pro in to check it out, replace or whatnot, I wouldn't go about prying things because if it's epoxied to your wall you'll fuck up your wall."
2021-04-19 22:13:40,wallstreetbets,"Does the stove cover up the part of the countertop that goes against the wall? If so I’d just cut that part out. Hard to tell with just that single pic. (My girlfriend keeps me around because I’m a handy retard)

Edit: or you could clean that cut up with a jigsaw/multi tool"
2021-04-19 22:13:45,wallstreetbets,"Instead of cutting the back strip out, use a straight edge and mark a straight line and use an orbital sander to make it less wonky"

If you do catch it, you have >99% chance of having a ""mild"" case. 

If you are young, in decent shape, and are otherwise healthy, there is very little to worry about. 

Now combine that with the fact that right now the U.S. is approximately at 50% immune (vaccinated or previously infected), your chance of getting it drops every day. Eventually we will reach heard immunity. 

So if you're not a high risk individual, there is really no need to be one of the test dummies for this hastily rolled out vaccine."

Honestly, I think Tesla is not telling us something. Elon musk keeps saying self driving does no activate unless someone is sitting in the drivers seat but there are so many videos on youtube of people's tesla driving itself while they are in the passenger seat.

2021-04-20 01:31:47,wallstreetbets,"Grab a single 5/21 $15 call then.

It will cost you about $80 (price shows as $0.80, which is per share, but is only bought in blocks of 100 shares), but if CLOV goes to $20, you would make $420 ($500 less the $80 premium you paid). Most you can lose is the $80.

Just make sure to sell to close sometime before 5/21 if price is over $15."

2021-04-20 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Potentially overshorted stock with a catalyst? Root Insurance - $ROOT Been trying to find value stocks but it’s not easy in a bull market so I’d thought I’d look at heavily shorted stocks. Haven’t seen much discussion about this company and thought I’d share. 

Root Insurance is a fintech company that had an IPO at the end of October. Their aim is to reinvent how auto insurance is done. You download the app and let it monitor your driving behavior for a few weeks. After the trial test driving period is done they give you a quote. Services are in 30 states. They are also getting into the home insurance market.

They seem to have a ton of class action lawsuits against them, the typical “contact us if you lost money on your investment” that every company has to deal with. They debuted at $27 and have gone down since and are at $10.30 as of writing this.  

Looking at insider transactions I noticed someone named Meyer Malka bought one million shares at $27 near IPO. Later in December he bought the dip and increased his position by 753,976 shares at $16.55 each. 

Did a web search for him and found this Walmart press release. 

https://corporate.walmart.com/newsroom/2021/01/11/walmart-announces-creation-of-new-fintech-startup

Tl;dr - Walmart partners with fintech investment firm Ribbit Capital (which Meyer Malka is on the board of) to offer “next generation digital financial products""

Walmart tried to sell car insurance back in 2014 (https://corporate.walmart.com/newsroom/2014/04/30/walmart-works-with-autoinsurance-com-to-bring-customers-first-of-its-kind-comparison-service) but that deal never panned out it seems. 

ROOT is currently 41% sold short. I want to compare it to LMND which is also an insurance company that had IPO recently but I haven’t been following that company at all so I won’t say anymore on the subject. 

Position is 900 shares @ $10.35"

2021-04-19 22:45:28,wallstreetbets,"Thanks, tips"
2021-04-19 22:46:07,wallstreetbets,"Oh for sure, I'm saying it was barely ""competitive"". Why would I bother switching insurance if it's not gonna save me any money? I would have switched if it saved me even 5 a month but it couldn't even do that when according to them I was in the top percentile of safe driving. I do want to reiterate this was around a year ago though, maybe their rates are better now. I just had a very mediocre experience at the time. It didn't help either that their 2 week test took me well over a month b/c I drive so few miles."
2021-04-19 23:02:22,wallstreetbets,"My auto insurance is $800 more than the cheapest option. My home insurance is $2k more. My umbrella, boat, golf cart, and four wheelers are all competitive. Why? Because I buy insurance in case I need it. This is why price isn't always important. I work in insurance and rarely do I sell the cheapest option. I sell the best option. This is what I meant by the goal isn't to be the cheapest. It is to be good at what you do at a competitive price. Let the consumer decide."
2021-04-19 23:27:59,wallstreetbets,"If you shop new insurance (which for most I would think the goal is to save money - literally the entire premise of Geicos ad campaigns in last 20 some odd years) you’d compare with the same deductibles, etc right? If you’re getting the same stuff and it’s not cheaper you’re probably not gonna switch. Maybe if they have the best customer service, maybe.  I would bet you Roots comparable insurance is more expensive with worse coverage than what you have. That’s my point."
2021-04-19 23:36:45,wallstreetbets,That is likely. I would never buy root but I am also not their target demographic. At least I don't think I am. It would also be pretty impossible to pull me from Amica/Chubb. They are just too damn good at what they do which is why I pay more.

2021-04-19 20:31:53,wallstreetbets,"The flaming car is **bullish**.

1. If you believe it was on autopilot, this means people trust it enough to get in the back while the car is driving.  That would be HUGE.  
2. Elon Musk denies it was on autopilot, and says that particular Tesla didn't even have the FSD option: https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/19/elon-musk-autopilot-not-used-in-texas-tesla-crash.html. But the fact the emergency responders thought that's what happens implies a *perception* people are trusting it, which is also HUGE, maybe even bigger.
3.  The current drop is a head fake from someone taking the news as an opportunity to manipulate it down and buy in. (my conjecture, but yeah, I really think so).
4. All of this is noise compared to earnings next week.  I've seen **A LOT** of Teslas on the road all of a sudden in the past month or two.  This earnings is going to be a blowout.

The delta suggests a 22% chance your 800Cs expire in the money.  I'm thinking really your odds are more like 50/50."

He paid roughly $5.90 for those 5 x 1000 calls and its currently at $1.90. Need to increase by a factor of 300% to break even and theta is not on his side. 

It’ll have to rise really fast in the next week to reverse back to neutral for him. 

800 calls are his best bet. Even those are a 15% bet right now. 

Needed to give himself more time, too short of a time frame.

I am definitely rooting for him. I also have Tesla calls that I bought today. But I got 30th April 715C when Tesla was at $700.

This isn't Asians VS the West. Chinese people lived in the US since like 1700s.

Plus like you said our tech talent is full of Asians. 

This is about the innovative environment that America fosters vs Chinese authoritarian brain drain.

2021-04-20 00:22:36,wallstreetbets,"Options is the fastest way to tendies.  Position sizing, controlling emotions and studying/learning much as possible.   I’m still learning.  

Study different strategies - how some traders look at charts, where they identify levels, pivots via volume profile/volume spread analysis, entries/exits on multiple timeframes, managing risk.  Always check the ETFs for how bigger names are moving within that complex - XLK, XME, XLE etc. so you can sus out sector rotations and jump in on the ones that are moving for the day/week. 

Always leave enough $/buying power to get in on buyable dips/DCA, take profits after big run ups, sometimes even 20-30% gains are fine.  Better to up 20% than down 20%.  I know we want to get that 10 bagger every time, but you need to pick and choose which one you’re willing to let run and which you want to take profit on since these days it seems that more to from green to red on a dime.  Sometimes if you don’t have high conviction it’s good to set stop losses.

There is nothing better than you parroting American propaganda like authoritarian governments, as if US isn't authoritarian regime itself already, I mean who else has been arresting their own freedom protestors at the capital hill? Whose the one that's shooting and killing freedom protestors at the capital hill? Whose the one that's arresting journalist and whistleblowers? Whose the one that's bombing other countries, has over 800+ military bases around the world, has biggest military budget in the entire world (bigger than next 10 countries combined), whose illegal occupying over dozens of countries right now as we speak?

2021-04-20 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Quick DD - Alteryx (AYX) - The less sexy Palantir for Business. Events in May. The sector Palantir & Alteryx find themselves in is expected to have huge growth regardless. While Palantir is the sexy, controversial, stock we all know. You want to know about this... nice... stock. 

A leader in analytic process automation (APA™) that automates analytics, data science and processes to accelerate business outcomes. 

Big clients who swear by it: Hyundai, Chick-fil-a, Barnes & Noble, Cisco, Carnival cruise, Chevron, and Coca Cola - to name a few. 

[first quarter 2021 financial results after the U.S. financial markets close on Tuesday, May 4, 2021.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alteryx-announces-date-first-quarter-200500424.html)  


|Market Cap|5.76B|
|:-|:-|
|2019 Total Revenue|417.91M|
|2019 Gross Profit|378.76M|
|2019 Operating Income|37.98M|

|2019 Total Liabilities|917.43M|
|2019 Total Equity|424.91M|
|% of Float Shorted|8.37%|

This is actually a profitable company unlike Palantir. To compare, Palantir is a 40B Mcap. 

It's expected to smash it's very low estimates. It has the last 3 times.

Analysists have given the stock high estimates. 

https://preview.redd.it/9djhjmpw66u61.png?width=637&format=png&auto=webp&s=e72c78d1f8d2185e7c0222e305e41b3377d94d73

The stock is down like some lesser known SaaS stocks. However, it's lagging behind recovery. 

To compares analysis estimates: Palantir +14.36%, 

https://preview.redd.it/fjsshc1gb6u61.png?width=728&format=png&auto=webp&s=cecd62c86b292f4e45c67dbf4cb30829d40f580b

The stock saw an insane increase of activity from insider trading, hedge funds, and general volume in the last quarter. 

While we don't like hedge funds, it's odd to see this volume of buy without much selling - especially as it's dipping. 

  
Q: **Why is this a post lockdown player?**

A: The tool was sold to lodes of companies trying to better themselves. Carnival cruise bought it when there weren't any cruises. Ceazers bought it when no one was gambling. Chevron USA when oil hit all time low. These companies are now imbedded to the service. 

Q: **Why don't companies do these things in house?**

A: The training, and learning, is free. In-house teams can learn this and join the community for free. In-house teams want this instead of trying to build there own.

Q: Why is May special?

A:  Annual conference, Inspire, will take place May 18-21 “**This year, we will announce major innovations across analytics automation, data science, machine learning and AI and the Alteryx Community platform**.”

2021-04-19 21:25:55,wallstreetbets,"By my rough napkin math they need to increase revenues to 25% of the projected TAM for PLTR of $119B (that's a 6000% increase in revenue), and reach a profit margin of 25%, then the current valuation makes sense. I think its possible but the TAM for PLTR is already questionable and to date AYX's best year on profit margin is only 21%. I think for PLTR and other data analytics companies will need to see a lot more revenue growth and margin improvement before jumping into these sky high valuations."

I'm a data viz SE and I wanted to work at Alteryx but they passed on me. Now I work for one of their competitors. Supposedly they are trying to push more towards SaaS and less on the massive bundle they currently sell.'

New construction costs as compared to standard tinted windows?  Only a limited number of high end buildings are built every year.

2021-04-19 20:19:26,wallstreetbets,BS. There aren’t even 200 m people left to vaccinate in the US
2021-04-19 20:52:25,wallstreetbets,150m Americans have received at least their first dose. Im confused how they get the last 200m people in the US doses before their competitors.
2021-04-19 20:27:32,wallstreetbets,"Irrelevant (again, we are talking about a third booster this year too). The only relevant question is how many more vaccines the US government will buy. 

Considering the newest covid relief bill had 6 billion for vaccines and the current lot were under the prior bill, I'd say they are anticipating purchasing more. Yes, some of that allocation is for manufacturing, but it's clear there is still money out there.

Also, it's worth it to note that Biden has said in no uncertain terms that he views it as the US's job to vaccinate the world, I'd assume the US is buying more than just for their citizens. I'd assume that certainly strategic allies and undeveloped countries are part of the US's strategy. And that coincides with the fact that the US  is the largest donator to UNICEF.

You might ask yourself, if that's the case, which vaccine is most likely to be the **preferred** option due to cost, transport, efficacy, and variants. Guess which one that appears to be?"
2021-04-19 22:03:44,wallstreetbets,"Yeah lol 50% of the population isnt even getting vaccinated how you going to sell 200,000,000 doses to the 20,000,000 people left. And this is just one covid vaccine."
2021-04-20 12:39:22,wallstreetbets,"You’re not seeing the whole problem, COVID is not going away it will be here forever (or for a long while), a vaccine booster is literally KEY in the fight to go back to what we once had. COVAXIN provides that and much more, for cheap and with effective results against all variants (you can take COVAXIN as booster after having taken MRNA &/or Pfizer) this has been known and is why OCGN will hopefully print for this guy. 

The US government will buy it even if people don’t take them, we need boosters and people will end up taking them as they’ll be required to do most things such as travel etc"
2021-04-20 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"DD: MVIS go BRRRR and I don't care which way. My medium-term bull case for MVIS.

&#x200B;

TLDR: Buy MVIS shares, sell way OTM monthly covered calls for absurd premiums.

&#x200B;

Disclaimer - I wrote this Sunday night after I decided on my course of action. I did not post until now because I wanted to actually do the trades before posting the DD. The numbers herein reflect prices at that time and they have since changed slightly.

&#x200B;

I'm fucking new at this. I got in with GME, I admit it. I'm probably completely fucked on this thesis, and I encourage you all to shit all over it so that I don't lose all my tendies on some batshit weed-induced fantasy. I don't know what I'm doing, and if you follow me you're literally retarded. That being said...

&#x200B;

I yolo'd my entire net worth on MVIS today. I'm poor, so this was only 500 shares, but fuck you. We all start somewhere. I just started late... and waited some more. And then missed the bus.

&#x200B;

Positions:

3 GME @ 238

500 MVIS @ 11.49 avg

\-5 MVIS 521 18c (0.70 premium realized)

&#x200B;

The most important factor in my thesis is the high IV of MVIS. Looking back at the last year, the IV and HV have been consistently high, which given the incredibly swingy nature of this WSB stock is not unexpected.

&#x200B;

In my research, which was probably half-assed and woefully inadequate, a high IV is a stock with above 60% or so, and the top few are above 100. MVIS is at 160%. Historically for the last year, this is not abnormal for MVIS. GME is also around 160% right now.

&#x200B;

High IV means that the options chain is often very expensive. Lots of people are gambling on this stock moving quickly, so you can sell covered calls for inflated premiums.

&#x200B;

Lets do some quick and dirty math.

&#x200B;

For our purposes we will use May 21 exp.

&#x200B;

GME: current 155. 521 300c is 8.35 (strike = \~193% current price)

MVIS: current 11. 521 20c is 0.80 (strike = \~182% current price)

RKT current 22 521 30c is 0.26 (strike = \~136% current price)

&#x200B;

So, lets look at a metric that probably has a name I don't know: (premium / stock price). This tells me that for every dollar I have invested into a stock, I can earn that amount for the option. This lets me rate options based on what I expect returns to be for selling covered calls.

&#x200B;

GME: 5.387%

MVIS: 7.273%

RKT: 1.182% (IV is \~60%)

&#x200B;

At 7.27% returns on a monthly option, if MVIS were to magically trade sideways and also keep its high IV for a year, you would have nearly doubled your money even if the stock ended the year at the exact same price.

&#x200B;

If MVIS drops, it will retain its high IV and you can continue to add shares and sell more monthlies until it rebounds. (Or you can trade the high IV to be much riskier with your pricing until it eventually catches you, hopefully turning a profit in the end - you're a paper handed bitch too)

&#x200B;

If MVIS spikes, you have a lot of opportunity to cash in because you are holding shares. Sure you could have \*bought\* calls instead of selling them, but I want to sell the lottery tickets not buy them.

&#x200B;

MVIS is currently dirt cheap at $11, and has been red all month. I think it's close to its bottom and is about to pop right back up a few bucks.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Ok, so let's talk potential gains and losses.

&#x200B;

Because my position is shares, my losses are fairly limited as I believe based on absolutely no evidence except a couple charts I saw once that there is a fairly hard floor of about $7 that it'll just never drop past again ever. Therefore my maximum loss is maybe $5/share. If I can get 0.80 premiums every month, then in six months I've basically covered my loss and can exit a slightly wiser ape. Or double down and keep selling the IV (This. I'll do this. It's just a dip. Buy more!)

&#x200B;

If the stock trades sideways for months and sheds its IV, then I continue to sell calls until I think I can get higher gains elsewhere, and I exit the position with less profit than I had hoped, but no losses.

&#x200B;

If the stock spikes but does not pass my strike, I roll the options out (and possibly up) and try to capitalize on the short term spike in IV and premiums. I keep holding until either the IV or stock price drops below levels I am happy with.

&#x200B;

If the stock spikes past my strike (currently $18) then I am assigned and exit the trade +$3,250 plus any premiums I got.

&#x200B;

In summary: I don't care if this stock moons, plunges, or charts a path like the fucking Evergiven as long as its IV stays high. I'm just gonna build my position and sell lotto tickets to people even dumber than me.

&#x200B;

I'm pretty confident in this, so I'm probably fucked. Please teach me. If you want charts and graphs, fuck you do your own DD. If you want rocket emojis, this thread is accepting donations.

&#x200B;

2021-04-19 21:49:48,wallstreetbets,"The only thing I don't agree with is the claim that CCs are a good approach right now.  It's been slowly bleeding since 03/31, and correspondingly  everyday calls are becoming cheaper and cheaper.  I had sold the 20c 4/16 back on 4/3 for like $1.35, but 05/21 calls are dirt cheap now.  I am hopeful for some sexy news in April that spike this back to >$15, then I'll sell CCs."
2021-04-19 22:48:46,wallstreetbets,"Did you watch the action in UWMC?  IV got crushed overnight.  I entered the UWMC play with CSPs and sold the May 10C before IV collapsed so I'm currently sitting at dead even.  At this point selling calls on this stock isn't even worth the hassle.  I'm holding stock on the chance they get included in the Russell index.

MVIS may play out similarly, though I nope not.  I sold the 13P and the 11P earlier this month and have already rolled those contracts out once."

2021-04-20 10:17:37,wallstreetbets,"I did that for a few weeks but ended up getting exercised at $11. I ended up buying back in and making a little bit of money, but that risk of exercise spooked me into moving into farther out calls with higher strikes. Prices are shit right now but if we see another spike up to $10.50 or $11 you could probably shift to selling November or January calls at something like $17-$20 and make good money for substantially lower strike price risk."
2021-04-20 08:03:02,wallstreetbets,Yeah WSB is the one that blocked buying causing the stock to crash. /s

2021-04-20 00:39:22,wallstreetbets,Options pricing fell hard after earnings. For a few weeks it was hard to sell calls at all but that seems to be turning around this week. Could be a good sign that we are reaching bottom.

For example, just 5 months ago it traded for $3 and change."

Random redditors with 40 day profiles coming in claiming massive short interest and a gamma squeeze.  You know the drill.    Probably go up a couple bucks and the investors will go “I told you so” then the herd will fall for the bait and latch on with diamond hands to end up carrying some bags.

2021-04-20 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"What's Happening in the Markets: Week of 4/19/2021 Hello Traders and Investors! An exciting week ahead of us, here is my weekly newsletter which I share every Monday to help prepare you for the week! Feel free to DM me and happy trades!

**Week of 4/19/21**

The S&P500 opened Monday 4/19/21 at 4179.80, just below the previous close of 4185.67 on Friday  
4/16/21.

Apple (AAPL) and Facebook (FB) prepare to square up over the social media platforms controversial  
tracking of consumer data. Facebook, which generates a large portion of its profits from targeted advertising, is known to collect consumer data to deliver the ads it believes will be the most successful. Apple has been in the process of developing what it calls “App Tracking Transparency,” for its devices and announced in January that the feature will be included and enabled by default on all new Apple operating systems. The technology, which was tested publicly in summer of 2020, will prevent applications like Facebook and Instagram from being able to collect user data. Facebook has begun preparations to sue Apple, who is currently in the midst of a lawsuit over App Store payments for the popular online game, Fortnite.

Apple CEO Tim Cook spoke on the issue following statements from Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg citing Apple as their, “biggest competitor.” Tim appeared committed to continuing to roll out the technology, saying, “Technology does not need vast troves of personal data, stitched together across dozens of websites and apps, in order to succeed. Advertising existed and thrived for decades without it. And we’re here today because the path of least resistance is rarely the path of wisdom. If a business is built on misleading users, on data exploitation, on choices that are no choices at all, then it does not deserve our praise. It deserves reform.”

Apple will hold its first product showcase of the year tomorrow, 4/20/21. The technology frontrunner is suspected to unveil our first glimpses of consumer-grade Augmented Reality technologies. The product showcase comes on the heels of a great month for the emerging AR industry, which was just the subject of a $20 Billion military contract with Microsoft. Apple is up 0.86% on the market open.

Emerging fitness company Peloton (PTON) traded down 5% on the open following federal regulators warnings against treadmills sold by the company. The Consumer Product Safety Commission released statements April 17th warning parents of children and pet owners to exercise caution after the death of a child who became wedged underneath the machine. At least 40 incidents of injury related to the machine have been recorded since its release.

Reports of Google (GOOG) using foreign tax loopholes to evade taxes have emerged. The company reportedly used the “double-Irish,” loophole to funnel over 100 Billion in profits through Ireland and into Bermuda in 2018 & 2019, allowing the company to collect the profits free of U.S. taxation. The loophole was addressed and abolished by the U.K. in 2015, however the nature of the change to legislation still allows companies established before it’s passing to exploit the loophole. A spokeswoman for Google indicated that the loophole is no longer being used by the company, and that the U.S. taxes avoided by using the loophole would have amounted to approximately 80% of all taxes levied against the profits.

The September 2020 agreement to merge NVIDIA (NVDA) and ARM Ltd. is currently in limbo as U.K. regulators have released statements intervening in the acquisition. The merger, which was negotiated by NVIDIA and SoftBank, is worth approximately $40 Billion. The intervention was released this morning, 4/19/21, and carries with it the stipulation that a full federal investigation be conducted and completed by the end of July 30th, 2021. The state of the deal is uncertain as markets await a press release from NVIDIA.

JP Morgan (JPM) has displayed considerable interest in funding a new professional soccer league in Europe. The European Super League, which was announced on Sunday by a dozen of the world’s largest football clubs, will be established to rival the current European Champions League, and will consist of 12 of Europe’s leading clubs, mostly from Spain and the U.K. A spokeswoman for JP Morgan confirmed in an email that it would be involved in funding the league, but the amount in which JP Morgan will be contributing is still unknown. JP Morgan posted earnings of 12.61 last week and was up 0.5% on the market open.

2021-04-20 10:46:56,wallstreetbets,"Snap is trading $7 off its all time high despite posting negative earnings for the last four fiscal quarters. When SNAP can start posting positive earnings, which it is approaching with earnings last quarter of only -$0.07, trading sentiment will turn and we will begin to battle for that all-time-high again. Until this company can start posting a profit you're going to be hard pressed to gather enough support from investors to push a $90B stock up that $7, 12%. Hope that helps and always feel free to DM me :)"

2021-04-20 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"PLTR - LOVE THE COMPANY / HATE THE SHORT TERM STONK I’m not a financial advisor...I’m just a 🐷 who likes tendies and knows not to fall in love with a stock.

TLDR: PLTR is game-changing tech, has a deep moat and a huge TAM. But, the stock has been beaten down...and without any upside catalyst...will likely break the $21 support level and grind down to $15...or lower. I exited my position and have buy order at $15...all tendies will be reinvested in more PLTR shares.


AMAZING COMPANY
Much DD has been provided on WSB...so I won’t go into too much repetitive detail.
- PLTR software is potentially world-changing.
- They been developing/optimizing this software for over a decade...funded by DOD/DARPA.
- Their B2B play is just ramping-up...they’ll likely be working with 50%+ of the F500 in 5 years.
- Their competitive Moat is Challenger Deep.


UNFORTUNATELY, NO UPSIDE CATALYSTS UNTIL EARNINGS IN MAY
Lots of downside catalysts: 
- Insider Selling 
- Wall St/Pro investors still don’t fundamentally understand PLTR.
- Management shunning Wall St...not playing the quarterly results game.
- The DoubleClick Demo Day last week was a dud...a real missed opportunity...PLTR didn’t manage expectations...the presenters looked into space somewhere off camera...and awkwardly read instead of presenting the amazing tech...they also went too far into the weeds...only presented 2 client categories...and never presented PLTR client results...the stock literally dropped from $26 to $23 in a day...and is still grinding lower.


BRILLIANT UNIQUE CEO
- Love Papa Karp...and he is building a world-changing company.
- But, when the CEO literally tells people not to buy “short term”...what kind of message does this send? 
- Who wants to buy a stock and watch it grind lower without any upside catalysts?
- Pro investor have many shiny objects to chase.
- Retail investors don’t have unlimited dry powder to buy the dips.


UPSIDE CATALYST
I do believe May earnings will be an upside catalyst.  The stakes couldn’t be higher. 

PLTR must beat estimates or risk going single digits."
2021-04-19 20:46:41,wallstreetbets,850@29 avging down from 32. hoping to get to 1k shares and sit tight. No crazy plays. Just a TFSA long hold that will buy me a house in the country

2021-04-19 22:27:23,wallstreetbets,"I agree with you. I’m short term bearish but long term bullish. I’m comfortable holding for 10-15 years unless a better opportunity springs along. I don’t mind it falling down because I’m trying to load up on shares to sell OTM CC for extra income. There’s no way the company will go tits up, there’s just no way when it’s backed by the government and the CEO is a real chad for focusing on the long term and DPOing to help retail investors. Big Data is the next oil and pltr is the cheapest stock Ik that can capitalize on that the most."

2021-04-20 00:16:46,wallstreetbets,I understand this is WSB but you guys really need to focus on time horizons longer than a month. The drop isn't bad; it's an opportunity to save my 23 calls expiring on Friday.
2021-04-20 01:12:34,wallstreetbets,"Anything below $20 is a strong buy IMO. If it were to hit $15, which i don't think it will, I would go extremely long on this ticker.

2021-04-19 20:22:02,wallstreetbets,For a stock that has steadily declined it sure gets a lot of attention. Why does it keep getting posts? Mentions? Attention? It's a loser. Personally down 22% since I read about it here November last year.
2021-04-19 20:29:03,wallstreetbets,Trying to determine the bottom for a stock you believe in is beyond retarded. Just buy and hold
2021-04-19 20:25:36,wallstreetbets,This video made me realize I have 1000 shares in the next Enron. He didn’t make a single coherent statement through that entire speech. Also why is he always wearing Swix?
2021-04-19 23:25:01,wallstreetbets,"I just watched the video.

Context for my next comment...I think Papa Karp is brilliant...and I love PLTR...I just don’t trust the stonk right now.

OK...this vid looks like a SNL bit. The barn...the outfit...the multi-camera set up...the editing.

What did he spend 5 minutes talking about?
- Freeing data to fight COVID...
- Freeing data to distribute vaccines...
- The US of A
- He does mention that the freeing of the data is...free...and the managing of the data...the $$$...is TBD.

This really doesn’t help the PLTR narrative.

I don’t really want any whale money managers to see this vid...except Mamma Wood.

He should have just shown us the straw bed where he plays with Mamma Wood."

""In-Q-Tel"" + ""Palantir.""

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-Q-Tel

>Originally named Peleus and known as In-Q-It, In-Q-Tel was founded by Norm Augustine, a former CEO of Lockheed Martin. Michael Crow served as In-Q-Tel's first CEO. In-Q-Tel's mission is to identify and invest in companies developing cutting-edge technologies that serve United States national security interests. Origins of the corporation can be traced to Ruth A. David, who headed the Central Intelligence Agency Directorate of Science & Technology in the 1990s and promoted the importance of rapidly advancing information technology for the CIA. In-Q-Tel now engages with entrepreneurs, growth companies, researchers, and venture capitalists to deliver technologies that provide superior capabilities for the CIA, DIA, NGA, and the wider intelligence community. In-Q-Tel concentrates on three broad commercial technology areas: software, infrastructure and materials sciences.

>Former CIA director George Tenet says,

>>We [the CIA] decided to use our limited dollars to leverage technology developed elsewhere. In 1999 we chartered ... In-Q-Tel. ... While we pay the bills, In-Q-Tel is independent of CIA. CIA identifies pressing problems, and In-Q-Tel provides the technology to address them. The In-Q-Tel alliance has put the Agency back at the leading edge of technology ... This ... collaboration ... enabled CIA to take advantage of the technology that Las Vegas uses to identify corrupt card players and apply it to link analysis for terrorists the parallel data-mining effort by the SOCOM-DIA operation Able Danger, and to adapt the technology that online booksellers use and convert it to scour millions of pages of documents looking for unexpected results.

The company's filed to go public says it ""does not work with clients or governments whose positions or actions are incompatible with the mission to support Western liberal democracy and its strategic allies."" The fact that the main clients of Palantir are precisely the US security forces and intelligence services fully reflects the company's commitment to this mission.

>""Palantir's numerous transparency and governance issues have been flying completely under the radar as they launch their public offering,"" Jacinta Gonzalez, a senior campaign organizer at Mijente, said in a statement. ""We're glad Representatives Ocasio-Cortez and Garcia tasked the SEC with investigating and are eager to find out why the agency has not done so.""

>The bottom line: A CIA-funded firm run by an eccentric philosopher has become one of the most valuable private companies in tech, priced at between $5 billion and $8 billion in a round of funding the company is currently pursuing. Karp owns roughly a tenth of the firm—just less than its largest stakeholder, Peter Thiel, the PayPal and Facebook billionaire. (Other billionaire investors include Ken Langone and hedge fund titan Stanley Druckenmiller.) That puts Karp on course to become Silicon Valley’s latest billionaire—and Thiel could double his fortune—if the company goes public, a possibility Karp says Palantir is reluctantly considering.

>For example, Ocasio-Cortez is concerned that in 2009, Palantir’s shareholder report revealed that the CIA’s venture arm — In-Q-Tel — held 10% of Palantir. However, she noted, its S-1 “did not say whether that investment was still in play or how many Palantir shares In-Q-Tel held.”

On the other hand, how did absolutely no one step in to tell him that this video is hot garbage?

2021-04-20 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"CGNT likely to be acquired by NNDM  **TL;DR**: Cognyte (CGNT) will very likely be acquired by Nano-Dimensions (NNDM), in a form of merger called a Reverse Triangular Merger, for a number of reasons including: highly synergistic offerings, favorable tax treatment and government funding given enjoyed by both Israeli companies, posturing and hiring of new executives in the defense space with head of M&A being recent president at Verint systems division which was spun-off to become CGNT as of February 2021. The combined entity would be profitable due to CGNT’s expanding margins and revenues along with NNDM’s large cash position and cash burn that is manageable on the combined balance sheet. Additionally the combined entity would be an industry leader with more offerings and capabilities globally than their competitors of Palantir or Fire Eye. The acquisition will occur quickly and likely be funded significantly from NNDM stock and the rest cash. Given the mismatch of market caps and estimated BV multiple of 7x-10x CGNT shareholders will be winners in the merger transaction, achieving a very favorable stock-to-stock exchange rate + cash consideration. Conservative estimated total value per share realized from CGNT shareholders of 40% relative to current share price with 16% low end premium if deal terms inked in the past few months are realized mark to market.

**CGNT Overview** (Lazy screenshots from Investor Presentation below): CGNT was recently spun off from Verint as a standalone entity, completed Feb. 1

**Why CGNT as Acquisition Target**

· NNDM has been highly vocal that they are planning an Acquisition for some time

· From the 20-F SEC filings from both companies they state that there are tax and royalties penalties from merging/acquiring a non-Israeli company along with manufacturing products outside of Israel, which CGNT does have manufacturing plant in Israel. Acquisition target would likely need to be an Israeli Company

· Both companies receive funding from the IIA which is a material part of project funding, with ramifications from merging/acquiring non-Israeli company.

· CGNT is the cyber threat and security spin off of Verint with the spin off occurring Feb 1, 2021. They are profitable with their growth strategy being expanding enterprise customer base, growing deeper with existing customers, adding verticals. This fits well with NNDM as they can aid expansion of verticals for both enterprise and government via production of and protection of enterprise/5G/security operations devices (CGNT provides IP data theft identification and prevention which is critical for NNDM to serve large enterprise customers)

· From the AME Academy NNDM demos different device capabilities of their systems including 5g, implantable/tattooable sensors which would be synergistic for CGNT security operations

· CGNT business model of software as a service meshes perfectly with NNDM’s plan to transition business model to software side from purely a manufacturer

· CGNT is profitable, the spin-off only makes sense if it was done for the purpose of a sale, 4 of 7 CGNT board members are current Verint board members/executives

· Hanan Gino appointed Chief Product Officer and Head of Strategic M&A: He was most recently in charge of the division of Verint that becam

**Why a Reverse Triangular Merger**

· The licensing agreement between Verint and CGNT only allow critical IP to be used if they are using for existing business activities and are not acquired by a 3rd party. The agreement does allow to be used by affiliates via sublicensing.

· A reverse triangular merger allows the acquisition to take place while keeping critical licensing contracts intact for CGNT

· The target (CGNT) must own substantially all of its assets and perform substantially the same business activities in order to qualify.

· The benefit of this type of transaction allows the acquisition to take place tax free if certain conditions are met, 80% of consideration is stock of acquirer and not more than 20% cash (might act differently due to different Israeli regulations)

· This kind of transaction can be performed quickly with minimal regulatory and shareholder actionse CGNT

· CGNT wording within their 20-F filling allows them to pass a merger/acquisition with 25% shareholder approval, classified as Emerging Growth Company and aren’t required to disclose proxy statements. They will easily be able to pass the merger without going through public shareholder announcement.

**What will NNDM need to Pay**

· Current CGNT market cap of $1.6ish billion

· Recent filing from CGNT lists Book Value of the company as $301.5M

· Using some conservative multiples of 7x-10x book value using competitors like FireEye, Palantir and IBM we get a Price of $2.7B to acquire CGNT (8.7x Book Value, $40 per share)

· Value at Current NNDM Share Price: At 80% of the consideration being stock to be tax free the exchange rate of CGNT to NNDM shares would need to be around 4 shares of NNDM for every 1 share of CGNT in addition to $8 per share in cash. This isn’t possible currently given that would exceed NNDM current shares outstanding so the cash consideration would need to be more or the agreed value of NNDM shares be higher (trading between 12-16 when CGNT was spun-off)

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/i29q5aetr5u61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=b0d0d4f63f00ec617da03ca8ca9602afac22473a

Highlighted prices are around CGNT spin off

· If the agreed value is at the recent direct offering at 12.8 per share of NNDM then the consideration paid would be 2.5 shares of NNDM for every share of CGNT and an $8 per share cash consideration. (This exact case likely would not occur unless SP rises or considerably more cash is paid above the tax consequence of breaching 20% cash – Virent still controls board and needs to ensure significant value is provided to former shareholders and justify spin-off)

· NNDM has the ability and spare cash to repurchase shares in order to drive price up in order to get NNDM market price up the pre-determined exchange rate value

· SEC Filing on Feb 15. 2021 amends the company’s articles to allow the board to call upon shares from shareholders giving further latitude for forcing acquisition if need be

**Other Notes and Consideration**

Options Activity

· Both CGNT and NNDM have extremely high options activity for May expirations

· NNDM Put/Call Open interest ratio of 0.53 indicates strong bearish sentiment

· CGNT Put/Call Open interest ratio of 0.06 and Put/Call volume of 0.01 indicates extremes in bearish sentiment but the extremeness of the value implies the opposite, being a major turning point

CGNT is required to pay Verint a one time cash dividend of $35m, being an impact per share of $0.51, theoretically this should already be priced in but the merger announcement would likely be after this payment is complete.

CGNT has affiliations with a blank cheque company according to the SEC website indicating that the merger has already been planned as a blank cheque company is required for a Reverse Triangular Merger.

**Risk Factors**

· NNDM stock is driven further down or doesn’t recover and the deal goes through anyway at unfavorable terms

· The combination of the two entities are viewed negatively and value is lost

· I completely misinterpreted the SEC fillings and Israeli tax laws

· The deal does not go through and the standalone CGNT entity is worth far less than expected

· CGNT was left with unknown liabilities passed off from Verint

· CGNT financials are misstated and fraudulent

**Conclusion**

While I think that NNDM will acquire CGNT if I am wrong about that I still believe that CGNT is an acquisition target for another company based on my findings.

If a merger doesn’t happen CGNT is still a strong play in their sector and has strong growth and profitability in the same industry as Palantir which saw ridiculous amounts of interest. I think the risks associated with this play are managed well, my view of probability of high returns in a short amount of time make for excellent risk adjusted return potential.

2021-04-20 12:48:16,wallstreetbets,"We bought our house in August, probably over paid, even offered 2k over asking to get a better shot at it as we knew they had other offers that day. Since then the estimate on the house is up 15k. Not that it matters I plan on living in it for 30 years but prices are waaay out of control. We wouldn't have been able to buy at our age if interest rates weren't low but man there are people asking 160k for a 2 bed 1 bath 1200sq ft house in our relatively lcol area. Just bonkers. I think the market has waay over corrected to compensate for the low interest rates, combine that with the now very low supply of houses on the market and I'm afraid the ship has passed to take advantage of the low interest rates. I'd probably advise people wait a year for the market to calm its tits, I don't see interest rates approaching 5% but who knows."

Whether I make an annualized 7% return on investment is so secondary in my brain. I mean if we want to look at it from an investment stand point rent will always go up, my mortgage will increase marginally with taxes and insurance and in 30 years I'll own the property so you definitely come out ahead in most cases. But for me the vital part of buying a house is lifestyle. I want a yard, I want to have bonfires. I want a garage. I want to be able to do whatever the fuck I want. There are so many beneficial aspects of living in your own house vs renting an apartment just on your mental health."

2021-04-20 12:57:28,wallstreetbets,"That's a crazy appreciation, congrats. The whole market is hit with a combination of factors that is pricing houses like wild. Someone else asked about inflation, it might be worth it to pay extra up front even now if the dollar is about to lose a ton of value. I'm with you, though, probably wouldn't buy right at the moment"
2021-04-20 01:36:14,wallstreetbets,"That assumes that supply/demand will balance immediately. In chicago we have a massive shortage of supply. So even if rates go up...good chance prices may stay high for a while as new houses will still have enough buyers to drive up bid price anyways.


Unless your timeline is over 12 months (mine isn’t, sadly) not sure we can wait around and find out :/

Curious what your thoughts are on this?"
2021-04-20 08:51:07,wallstreetbets,"Ok.  Watch the stock all week, you’ll know when it’s peaking and sell covered calls for $1.50 to $2.00 strike above peak share price for the week, based on your knowledge.  When stock price is going up, you can sell covered calls for more (due to increased value and direction of its movement) I’ve been grinding out my losses with covered calls while keeping the stock in my possession.  This is the same strategy i use on AMC and PLTR.  You should decide for yourself what strategy works for you and your risk tolerance."

2021-04-19 20:10:13,wallstreetbets,"> then why would you put it off for a couple years

Because there are only two markets right now - below-median homes that are shitholes nobody wants, or 2x median homes that are selling for 15% above asking price with waived contingencies.

The rental market is pretty sane, especially compared to the nonsense going on with single family homes right now, so there's very little reason to buy for ""the psychological feeling"" which is honestly WSB-level retardation."
2021-04-20 00:22:19,wallstreetbets,You just can't put a price on the psychological feeling of moving out of your grandma's attic.
2021-04-20 10:27:01,wallstreetbets,"Oh I though you always had to renegotiate and that the first rate was just the trap, if you can get a decent fixed one that’s pretty cool. I want to buy a house, managed to save 50k but my job is over, the shop closed and I’ll have to go back to school for a year, sadly with the housing market, I am kinda scared to make a move now considering that house get outbid by 50-125k in average. The thing I am certain of is that price have actually a very good chance to go up since the government is injecting big money in the economy, I feel like inflation rate is about to explode."
2021-04-20 08:15:56,wallstreetbets,"You're right in that it isn't immediate.  It takes a couple months for prices to change, as offers cool down since buyers can't afford the same price at a higher rate.

I certainly wouldn't wait on interest rates.  Better to save enough for however much house you want and buy it than hope to time the market perfectly.  Especially somewhere like Chicago where growth will always keep appreciation pretty high.  Just make sure to get a fixed rate loan, fuck ARMs.

My timeline is 3-15 months.  I'm moving in with the in laws knowing that the insane housing market may price me and my s.o. out until next summer, when we have a greater down payment.  I'm not waiting for rates.  I doubt rates will rise till late '22 or even '23, given JPow's attitude, and it's not worth putting my life on hold for a gamble that rate rises will outpace appreciation."

2021-04-19 20:26:16,wallstreetbets,"Your local market may vary but in my state it is not that bad. I only had to offer $4,000 above the appraisal value for the house I am buying. My mom, on the other side of the state, has been considering moving back to her old apartment, but they raised the rent by like $150 over the course of the 1 single year she has not lived there. Rental market and real estate market are very dependent on the location. 

You're likely to pay just as much money for a mortgage payment as you are for a rent payment, except with the rent payment you get nothing except a place to stay, and with the mortgage payment you are building equity in a tangible asset.

In my situation, I believe buying a home is a smarter decision than renting and hoping that I can still afford it in a couple years when the interest rates are much higher and you've already (hypothetically) sunk tens of thousands of dollars into rent payments."
2021-04-20 01:30:02,wallstreetbets,"Value is relative, for some the psychological effects are worth more than the (purely speculative) difference in price compared to a year from now.

2021-04-20 10:31:10,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I wasn't thinking through it 100% in my post, houses will probably retain a ton of value (go up in price) if interest rates start rocketing"
2021-04-20 17:47:27,wallstreetbets,"Fair enough, appreciate the thoughts. Just tough trying to ‘choose’ between timelines and significant moneys. And yea I don’t think waiting around based on “hope” makes sense for me right now, given I could wait and still pay the same amount (or higher lol)"

2021-04-20 09:13:15,wallstreetbets,with interest rates this low it might not be a bad deal anyways
2021-04-19 20:19:59,wallstreetbets,"At least the taxes only amount to like 2% of the total property value, plus they use those taxes for the public good, like maintaining the road and sewer system. 

But yeah, if you're a big believer in the ""taxation is theft"" philosophy then you're not gonna be happy about paying a yearly fee to keep your house on your plot of land."

2021-04-20 11:25:34,wallstreetbets,bullshit.  I bought my house in 2007 at the height for 327 k and sold it last summer for 335k  so in 13 years it basically did nothing.  It's hard to get out of bubble prices

2021-04-20 01:55:55,wallstreetbets,I mean not fully the same position idk if we start seeing defaults then sure a problem but stats even in covid time no more than average were found to be behind on payment sand we can keep supply in the market shit will keep on a chugging

I’m just saying I know I don’t own shit, just the right to have it as long as I’m paying for it, even if I’ve paid off my mortgage. I didn’t say taxation was theft, but there sure as shit would be some theft if I quit paying the man for what I “own”."
2021-04-19 21:02:04,wallstreetbets,Much less than that even in some places.. after all the discounts of being a young person and living in the home my property taxes ended up being less than half a percent of the property value.
2021-04-20 11:06:04,wallstreetbets,"2 percent on a 250k property is still a nuisance. God forbid your property inflates 2x in value but your peasant wages don't.   


I'd rather use my tendies to build property in the Caribbean where a house can be built for 20-30k with no property taxes, use the overseas rental income to pay for the extortion fee for the property in the USA, or just live in the house located in the Caribbean."

2021-04-20 00:37:11,wallstreetbets,"Yeah lol basically this. If inflation happens everything measured against the dollar (so any asset) will go up. Commodities, stocks, houses etc

Probably much less demand to live there now that a lot of jobs in silicon valley can be ""work from home"" instead of having to actually live close to your employer.

On the other end of the spectrum, you used to be able to buy a home in Detroit for like $10 (with some considerations like back taxes and actually having to make improvements to the property.)"

It’s crazy, you didn’t give me any money, but I’m going to FEEL way less “gouged” when I buy, so in effect, mentally, I’ll have felt like I lost less money. You gave me a the equivalent of 15k worth of psychological gains!!!


🥳🥳🥳"
2021-04-20 09:25:56,wallstreetbets,"Not to mention that if you buy with a fixed rate mortgage (you should), your housing cost is nearly fixed, while all the renters get squeezed for more each year. In my market, a house is barely more than rent (it's actually the same if you buy a house with some cosmetic issues and fix it up).  Give it a few years and you're not only gaining equity through principal pay down and appreciation, but also saving monthly on cash flow.  You've also leveraged your down payment to buy an asset worth 5x to 25x that down payment at a rate just above inflation."
2021-04-20 11:10:52,wallstreetbets,"At least a we can move the van around to avoid the man and his registration fee. If I could shrink my house and put it in my pocket, I'd never pay a property tax bill again."

But with tenants rent is double what the mortgage is so currently raking it in, in 9 months the 32k put in as down payment we just this month got saved back up looking to do it again currently :P next duplex should get us to where full rent covers all 3 mortgages.

2021-04-20 09:09:21,wallstreetbets,🤦‍♂️
2021-04-19 21:11:46,wallstreetbets,"That’s true, but what I was considering a big move is really not that big of a move.  I’d be happy with a move up to to the $13.50 - $15.50 range if we can get it within the next 10-15 trading days.  With my current position, that would be nice lick and the sonnet the better obviously as far as May options go.  Unless this company is a total shit show, it most certainly go up in a reasonable amount of time if anyone is just holding stock, I would sweat it from here.  I think downside going forward is $2ish short term with a reasonably unlimited upside given enough time for the company to grow and mature. Option play, one mat have to take a partial loss, but you can always roll out to further expirations and give yourself time to recover and make up losses and turn a profit.  I’m not a dreamer expecting the May $30 calls to be in the money before expiration.  If it happens that would be blessing for many well wishers and myself.  But the fundamental reasons behind this play are solid, the hype and insane buying, if this activity continues for a few more days a sizable run up in price will certainly happen I think and any big move up will more than likely follow with a fall back down probably just as fast, it might not go back sub $10 but probably build support somewhere in the low teens.  Hell, like you said nothing is certain and everything is speculation & supply and demand.  Hopefully we are all on the right side of this one."

2021-04-20 12:59:53,wallstreetbets,"Sudden cfo resignation and ceo selling some shares caused a panic and sudden drop in the price pre market and today.

2021-04-20 15:01:02,wallstreetbets,Why not options
2021-04-20 07:55:11,wallstreetbets,"Is it though? Assuming 10% net profit margin, for example, and assume they beat 2022 revenues and land at 350, thats 35 mill. If you pay todays price of 1.35 bill and subtract the 200 mill +- on the balance sheet. you have a 35mill on 1.15 bill market cap = giving a 3% earnings yield. This is a fast growing company and the stock shouldn't yield that high, but I don't have enough visibility in relations to their potential growth 2+ years out to conclude that this a particularly good risk/reward. I might be wrong thoug."
2021-04-19 20:14:07,wallstreetbets,"this aged well today. Hopefully, it turns around. 

Lucky for you, I don't intend to go in on this, so it should do well. When I go in on something it tanks...

2021-04-20 17:24:22,wallstreetbets,nice
2021-04-20 16:02:46,wallstreetbets,Just personally too much risk for little reward. This stock is being ignored hard by wall street and who knows when it will actually pop.
2021-04-20 09:55:26,wallstreetbets,"They aren’t in major grocers yet, I.e. Kroger and Albertsons. The results you’re looking at are also largely pre-Target launch, which they have been performing very well at. 

This is the rare, beautiful case where Wall St may actually be very wrong short term. You’re sitting at 47% held by insiders with one of the board members making a huge purchase on Friday. The stock is getting punished over a deal the CEO made prior to their SPAC."
2021-04-20 15:33:16,wallstreetbets,"Yes make no mistake this is not a value stock, it is very much a growth stock and you are paying a premium for it. If you look at their full year 2020 results, they've grown their branded revenue over 300% YOY. Their previous source of income was white label deals with razer thin margins. As we go forward, I think net margins will continue to rise where they currently are. There is a strong case for both top line and bottom line growth."
2021-04-20 16:16:54,wallstreetbets,What are your estimates then? Or just hoping that multiples stay high?
2021-04-20 16:48:07,wallstreetbets,"I think their guidance is fairly reasonable actually. By 2026 1 billion in revenue with gross margins of 35%. Lets say around 15% net income is reasonable to me. Considering Kind recently sold to Mars for 5 billion for 1.5 billion in sales, from the current valuation I would say a tripling over 5 years from current prices isn't out of the question. Overall though, the TAM for Tattooed chef is much larger so if management can continue to execute I think we can see even larger numbers over the long term."
2021-04-20 16:57:02,wallstreetbets,"Ignoring the valuation, a 15% yielder (potentially) in 5 years is a no brainer for you? Your required gains must be very low. (this sounds negative but im genuinely asking)"

I am genuinely partial towards this type of Nuclear energy and infrastructure plays so I desperately need to hear the more skeptical version of things.

2021-04-20 03:13:14,wallstreetbets,"Thank you for your skepticism here. Although I'm absolutely partial towards this variety of tech you being up valid points here. Furthermore not even from a logistical or technical standpoint here, but do we really think that Nuclear power, which is already coming with significant pubkic stimgma will suddenly breakthrough because of a small scale colder reactor core?

It literally burns fuel faster than a mich more safer nuclear plant. Absolutely without exception do I think Nuclear id the near 5-10 year future, it just won't be built on something so against public stigma about the hazards and environment hazards of nuclear energy.

If the OP has any counter points I would also love to hear it."
2021-04-20 03:21:55,wallstreetbets,"Never argued it was more efficient. I was explaining it burns more of the fuel which is cleaner and safer producing minimal waste. This is not synonymous with efficiency. 

Uranium is cheap. It’s expense is waste storage. The lower the concentration of radioactive materials the cheaper it is to store the waste."

2021-04-20 07:45:17,wallstreetbets,"I've seen so many people in the comments complain about the downside risks. Well the risks have already been mentioned and covered in the article, so imo it's pointless to add a new ""risks"" section explainning them AGAIN, when they have already been covered in the article. That was the point of writting a long article, covering everything. Unsure why you guys want me to repeat something that's already said but there you go. I want to guess some want to hear some false IF's, IF Oraldeyo isn't able to bring revenue, IF's BCX9930 study doesn' t develop correctly etc etc. As i have explained in the article those IF's are not doable, and if I mentioend them it would basically be false info, misleading people. But, there we go again 👍😘

1 - Company not managing to generate revenue - CEO confirmed they will bring $500MM.

2 - BCX9930 studies not developing as expected/delays - Ph1 data was that good that it enable the study jump from a Ph1 to Ph3 skipping the Ph2.

3 - Offerings - As i stated in the article, CEO confirmed offerings will not be needed, they are properly funded.

4 - Competition - I've shared the undergone surveys which showed the strong willingness patients had to switch from needles to Oral pills. Related with the efficacy, safety etc, I've shared a photo where all the relevant """"Factor D"""" sudies were shown, demonstrating how BCX9930 showed better results than the competition.

5 - Investing in the Bio sector ain't an easy thing. This kind of stocks often are heavily manipulated. As an example, BCRX dropped from 16 to 11 the day it showed excellent BCX9930 data. My suggestion do your own DD be 100% sure what you own is GOLD to not let manipulation and stress affect you.

2021-04-19 21:54:33,wallstreetbets,"The company I work for manufactures items in china and sells them all over the world but mainly the US.  Our experience with COVID in regards to manufacturing and access to materials was and is not as bad as you are describing. Factories were completely closed for 2-3 months in spring 2020 but then reopened at full capacity pretty quickly and have remained that way ever since. Global freight shipping is annoying right now. Prices and time are up but it is by no means haulted. Just slightly delayed and pricey.  I am sure each industry is different but from what I am seeing it is annoying and not normal but not prohibitive or effecting business in any real way.  

What is more likely is that the companies that are delayed and/or having materials issues forecasted incorrectly. My opinion is these companies forecasted that the insane demand that COVID caused would not continue past COVID. Bad bets are made all the time. Who knows better than us lol"
2021-04-19 21:55:12,wallstreetbets,I work for an industrial supplier. From what I can tell trucking is fucking slow as shit and there is a massive steel shortage. Manufacturers have passed on substantial price increases on almost everything probably about 3 times in the past year.

2021-04-19 23:08:27,wallstreetbets,"My Tesla model 3 on autopilot has saved my life twice, in situations a human driver never could.  It is WAY safer to drive with autopilot on. The key thing is, the car still needs a driver in the driver seat who is paying attention to the road (easier to pay attention actually, since u don't have to focus on the mundane aspects of driving). Any other usage is against TOS.

IDC wtf any FUD short has to say about autopilot. They are morons who have never used it."
2021-04-19 23:12:15,wallstreetbets,I tried to get behind Tesla’s but I couldn’t get over how boring they are. In the end I kept my 2014 carrera S a little longer. May get a taycan though it has a nice interior unlike the Tesla’s.
2021-04-20 00:34:11,wallstreetbets,"Yes it's true, for many reasons.

Disclaimer: I have 2 teslas.

1.  Teslas have some advanced collision avoidance.  It can auto brake when cars I don't even see are braking hard.  It sees through the car in front of you and calculates impact potential a few cars ahead so even if the car you're following rear ends, you're OK.  It swerves when the person next to you swerves.  

2.  Teslas are still pretty expensive.   Even the cheap ones are above average price for new cars.  This is a generally more responsible driving demographic tat doesn't include as many 16 year olds, so the safety numbers skew better than the average of all drivers.  

3.  Teslas are newer than the average age of cars on the road.  newer cars are inherently safer than older cars.  The average car is almost 13 years old, the Average Tesla is about 2.5 years old (they have been out for more than a decade but they make more cars in a month now than they made in the first few years).

4.  Tesla engineers the cars to pass the safety tests in the computer before they actually builds a test car.  The famous ""broke the rollover machine"" test was accomplished by modeling the test in the computer and building the car to annihilate that test machine for maximum marks.  They game stress test modeling for safety rules to get the max scores."
2021-04-20 03:10:12,wallstreetbets,"Crash testing shows phenomenal results, I still don’t trust the auto pilot though. If I were to buy an electric, I wouldn’t get a Tesla anyway, the most boring interior, just sucks the joy out of driving."
2021-04-20 07:47:24,wallstreetbets,"It's obviously a variable, I would guess that people who buy Teslas are generally wealthier and are more concerned about safety; they are likely safer drivers in general."
2021-04-20 09:53:13,wallstreetbets,"Having drove a model 3 before, I can say the car is loaded with safety features, the car is basically holding your hand as your drive with blind spot detection, lane detection and loads of other things. I also think Tesla’s being luxury cars the people who buy them are driving them a little safer then say a 2001 Honda Civic."

It has a solid electrolyte so it should be much safer and not catch on fire as easily, even a chain reaction could be stopped. Good thing Panasonic and LG are also looking to make the same batteries, probably some will end up in other vehicles."
2021-04-20 04:49:37,wallstreetbets,"That could certainly be a factor, although they have a lot more data than just whether FSD is enabled. I guess Tesla is the only one that knows. For example, they also distinguish between safety features enabled or disabled and the difference there is already pretty huge."

The owners, from what I've read, mainly the Glazers (owns Man U and Tampa Bay Bucs) and Kroenke (owns Liverpool and LA Rams) are pushing really hard for this new league. Why? Mainly because under the current structure of the UEFA Champions League, Glazers and Kroenke cant go out and make tv deals or ad deals because they don't own the rights to the Champions League. However, by making their own league (European Super League), Glazers and Kroenke could go out and make tv distribution deals and advertisement deals--and if we know anything at all, there is HUGE money to be made on tv deals and ad deals. They are taking a page out of the NFL's playbook, just look at the NFL's tv deal, it's freaking massive, the NFL will be paid $100+ billion for the next 10 years by CBS, NBC, FOX, and ESPN/Disney."

2021-04-20 08:44:17,wallstreetbets,"Right.

So you rank a football team equal to family.

1)You either don't have family that you consider close, so maybe you're not so popular and good to be around.

2) You have a wife/hubby/whatever and still relate a football team as equal to that feeling? You've fucked up your life in that case. If not, you must be a lonely cunt. 

3) You don't have any kids. If you did, you'd understand love and family and how a football team doesn't even come close.

Finally,
Why the harsh response? Because you're obviously an unlovable cunt if you engage in a discussion then respond like a brainwashed unlikeable cunt.

Well done."

As I see it you are extremely rude, and I have said or done nothing to you, and have not been rude to the guy I was having a discussion with.. you came from the sideline to a discussion you were not a part of and label me as someone I'm not.. youre clearly the rude one.

2021-04-20 09:57:20,wallstreetbets,"Dear Diary 
Today I told an 'angry' Internet stranger that I had 40 mins left of work left before I went out to be with friends in the sunshine. 
I think that my previous comment implied that by going out to be with friends in the sunshine, somehow I was superior and would not need to engage anymore. My psychological analysis was sound. 
For some reason I did feel the urge to explain my work situation because my feelings got hurty because Liverpool is my family. 

Note the 40min delay to my response.

2021-04-20 04:28:32,wallstreetbets,">TLDR

No, I'm not invested and I am not bullish at this point. It's a great idea but until I see the technology, it's difficult to assume that it will do anything more than prevent accidents on the highway and more awareness around the semi. I haven't seen the truck roll onto our parking lot yet. They are testing this stuff out in AZ from what you can read in the article. Our DC in Houston is #1 inside the company as far as performance and moving product. Once we incorporate Whataburger in June, we will see a major increase in volume. We could very well be a first adopter of TUSIMPLE but the company isn't moving at a fast pace toward new tech or self driving. The company is still growing but to say it's a fraud, IDK. You know how Warren Buffet and Munger do there business so I'd be surprised because usually there are red flags."

The pre-order misshap was smoke and mirrors- no value if there aren't 100,000 orders lined up. If those trucks get delayed, it's RIP. If they release and sales are only 10% of what the company hyped, it's RIP."

2021-04-20 08:13:20,wallstreetbets,Yeah I read into this. There was some information that the media put out that was also questionable. Tesla can't go auto pilot if you have no seat belt on if I am not mistaken.
2021-04-20 12:05:12,wallstreetbets,"Sadly, every example we have against the safety of Tesla can be directly attributed to  bad drivers or no drivers. Some people don't realize how young this tech is"

2021-04-20 11:50:39,wallstreetbets,I know the driver. He was a respected doctor at work. We all believe media is spinning this and what actually happened was he left the driver side trying to get other doors to open but couldn’t either due to frame damage or computer damage that had kept them locked in
2021-04-19 22:11:03,wallstreetbets,Glad I did.
2021-04-20 11:52:30,wallstreetbets,It was car v tree accident. The driver was a respected doctor that I know. Probably couldn’t escape when the car caught fire hence why he wasn’t in the driver seat and they were trying to escape through other doors but failed
2021-04-20 12:08:27,wallstreetbets,"I dunno about you, but I was taught to not use water to put out electric fires."
2021-04-19 21:19:10,wallstreetbets,This is a stupid excuse. Most car manufacturers have a system where you need move the steering wheel every now and then or the car will stop
2021-04-20 11:48:21,wallstreetbets,Or maybe just maybe they got trapped in the car when it caught on fire and the driver tried other doors then passed out from the smoke. Just maybe.
2021-04-20 12:04:15,wallstreetbets,"That makes no sense. The car was in motion so what does any of that have to do with anything? Are you telling me that the car went rogue and started driving at high speeds, crashed hard enough to start a fire?"

2021-04-20 12:06:40,wallstreetbets,"I’m not saying how exactly it ended up hitting a tree. Could have lost control for multiple reasons. But if they were still conscious after the crash and the car caught fire and they couldn’t get out, that would explain why the driver wasn’t in the driver seat. Just saying media everywhere is focusing on driverless when at the end of the day no one knows for sure if the car was moving without a driver or not yet they’re spewing it out like it’s canon"
2021-04-20 12:09:21,wallstreetbets,One theory is they attempted launch mode then lost control at the curve
2021-04-20 11:56:04,wallstreetbets,Except when you know the driver to be a well respected doctor.
2021-04-20 13:38:04,wallstreetbets,Ahh now we're coming up with theories huh? Let's stop making excuses for negligence.

2021-04-19 20:04:25,wallstreetbets,What I'm saying is I wouldn't trust them in regard of going to sleep or thinking I didn't need to keep my eyes on the road and surroundings. I believe that these automated driving vehicles are already better than your average driver. But I would never trust them to drive me in their current state because I consider myself a very aware driver.
2021-04-20 11:58:30,wallstreetbets,Well respected people do dumb or terrible things just like anyone else. Sucks.
2021-04-20 13:40:04,wallstreetbets,Why are you hell bent on shitting on the dead? I’m not making excuses for anything but am upset at media making up stories about this being a driverless problem when that might not have been the case.
2021-04-20 14:26:46,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I saw that. But two people definitely died, that was the part of what you were saying that I thought was weird"

Do you have a Tesla?  Most people on this thread clearly don’t own one and are parroting stuff they read on the internet."
2021-04-20 11:59:28,wallstreetbets,The thing we are thinking happened was they tried launch mode and lost control

2021-04-20 13:45:40,wallstreetbets,"No one's shitting on the dead. You're making excuses, trying to find ways to excuse their behavior that put others at risk. There was no driver, and the car was moving at high enough speed to destroy the car and engulf it in flames, killing two of it's passengers. That's negligent behavior that could've harmed others. They tried to abuse the features on the car. You're going off of ""might and maybes"". Maybe the car was actually a transformer and killed those passengers on purpose. I'm looking at it the way I see it and based off of the information I was given."
2021-04-20 00:09:28,wallstreetbets,Why are you upset at my opinion?

2021-04-20 12:00:42,wallstreetbets,Oh... so something stupid and reckless
2021-04-20 13:51:29,wallstreetbets,"What do you mean make up your mind? It’s part of the same theory. Either way we are debating over something no one will ever know the true story to, including the media that’s saying things as if it’s for sure what happened. And you’re just as bad for believing it all without questioning it."
2021-04-20 13:48:32,wallstreetbets,You tell me how they could tell someone was not in the drivers seat at the time of impact when the car was burnt to a crisp. It doesn’t even make sense to have been in that car driverless in that area to begin with. You can’t tell me media gets it right every time and is just trying to sensationalize this because it was a Tesla
2021-04-20 00:52:41,wallstreetbets,Who’s upset? I’d just like you to know you’re wrong that’s all
2021-04-20 12:02:15,wallstreetbets,"Yah still reckless, but not riding in car not in the driver seat reckless. Both are pretty bad though. Or maybe none of those things happened and it’s something completely different like dodging an animal at the end of the cul de sac they didn’t see. Who knows really."

2021-04-20 04:28:05,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-04-19 21:26:44,wallstreetbets,"Basic resource sellers have good reason to excuse inflated prices, but I expect that governments will quickly anger at profiteering during and after a world health crisis. There are laws that prevent profiteering during crisis, usually from natural disasters. Well, was SARS-CoV-2 not a natural disaster? Exactly. Of course it was. I expect governments will use their power to implement price controls on products and punishments for those manipulating supply availability. Governments want to return to competitive productivity and maximize gains (tax), so lowering the cost of the most inflationary causes is another motivator for governments to implement price controls on energy and building materials. It wouldn't surprise me if governments offered refunds to shareholders to make the price controls more acceptable to all involved. Subsequently, offering that shareholder refund for losses from stock price declines due to price controls might be the only way to divest the billions stuffed into stocks, because they probably wouldn't find a enough buyers at the inflated stock price. Like the 90x multiple in Freeport McMoran (oil, copper), or the 150x multiple of SunCoke Energy (coal).

The difference between 2021 and 2008-11 is that now it is a natural disaster that disrupted more than the financial system. Three million have been reported dead from CoViD19 worldwide. I am sure that the civil unrest around the world will also play into the story about how recovery will happen."

So if you see him talk about something and think 'yeah that's pretty good' write down the price and wait 1-3 months, pick it up at a discount, and then go take the remainder and buy yourself a nice sweater. Cause that's horse sense!"
2021-04-19 21:43:50,wallstreetbets,has anyone here tried to take advantage of cramer effect? Does it peak too quickly or can you work this?

2021-04-19 21:47:04,wallstreetbets,"ARK bought Coin to get exposure to bitcoin. The setup of Cathy's ETF doesn't allow her to directly buy bitcoin but she's bullish on it and wants some of that $$$. Coin is expected to increase at a similar growth rate to bitcoin, albeit with way more downside potential because they're lunch could get eaten by other exchanges."
2021-04-19 21:57:26,wallstreetbets,"i checked a few of his picks they go up after the show the next day but by less than 1%. Kinda meh returns, you could make a lot more doing the WSB pumps"
2021-04-19 23:37:13,wallstreetbets,Upvoted for use of 🚀🚀
2021-04-20 05:15:26,wallstreetbets,"Why would COIN share value increase at ""a similar rate"" to  bitcoin? - Coinbase are just a broker, there are quite a few crypto brokers around if you look, and also brokers who deal with stocks and crypto - Coinbase charge unreasonably high percentages and they drain client money with excessive margins, but they are still only a broker. Nothing ""special"" about them. They aint Saudi Arabian oil sheiks -  crypto doesn't come out of the ground under their feet. Any stock or crypto you have - you buy and sell through a broker, right?  So .. er .. investing in a broker is the yellow brick road to getting rich?

Pity we didn't know sooner - we could all have cut out the share trading and invested in the middleman!  Er ... did I get the logic right?"

2021-04-19 21:44:27,wallstreetbets,Maybe focus on breaking even first.
2021-04-20 11:54:34,wallstreetbets,It wouldn't be a long term wealth development if the price of options are so shitty now :X I have 900 shares @ 16. Selling weekly covered call at 11 earning around $80 a week. This week's call is so low it's not even worth risking it
2021-04-20 12:31:23,wallstreetbets,"I never said weeklies. The point is to wait on days where IV is high and sell monthlies minimum. You collect theta premium, not delta premium, so the longer date is better for you. You lose on Delta so medium OTM calls sold at 90DTE will net 30% every week or so on that option if you ride IV right. If you time it wrong, well shit... you just sold your shares at a comfortable price higher than your buying point and you raked in monthly option premium while doing it. 

How the helm that isn't long term idk. It's not fast, but its consistent. That's how long term works.

EDIT: It doesn't help if you didn't go into your position with that intent. 

As you said, you bought @ 16 per share. Looking at Jan 22's they're 0.30 per contract of 20c's.

You can still collect that ~300 premium for lowering your cost average (or more on an up $BB day) and then sell shares at $4 ITM on 900 shares if you let them cash to expiry. That's a 3k profit in this scenario or an opportunity to avg. down.

A fool would exercise those calls, only bringing you more capital."
2021-04-20 14:21:38,wallstreetbets,"Thank you, I’ve never thought of DTE more than a month (idk why, probably cause it’s wsb mentality and the last time I calculate weeklies earning are more than monthlies). Will look into more further dated options, appreciate your enlightenment"
2021-04-20 14:24:49,wallstreetbets,"Weeklies only make more money if you can swindle the swings. If you do it on a highly volatile stock though, you can do puts/calls on the swings and make quick money on weeklies.

Edit: selling that is. All selling"
2021-04-20 10:29:55,wallstreetbets,I’m a smooth brained fool and bought 20 $17.5c and I see the price is going up and my contracts price is going down. Can you help an ape out and explain what’s going on?

These EV vehicles aren’t off road racers, they’re like golf carts basically. That’s actually pretty impressive, my f150 would be all fucked up if I replicated that same clip"
2021-04-19 22:03:26,wallstreetbets,You’re just a hater
2021-04-19 22:56:11,wallstreetbets,The performance expectation is established by hiring a truck racing company to build the vehicle.
2021-04-19 23:10:17,wallstreetbets,"Yes but they wanted to prove the concept of their actual product, so they stuck with the same frame, motor, battery and software. Sure by the time they added all that weight, it definitely slowed it down. I’m bullish on the start, but not the technology. EV technology is not that impressive to me. It’s basically like a golf cart. But that is the future, that is what people want, and I think they’re doing pretty good for what they are. Personally? I’m all about diesel."
2021-04-19 23:11:33,wallstreetbets,"The reason why they didn’t continue with the race is because the battery was draining a lot faster than I thought it would, and they didn’t think they would be able to get through the next leg safely without potentially breaking down and blocking the course for somebody else. There were some pretty bad accidents, that may have spooked them, but the next leg was going up into the mountains and they didn’t want to break down. Could you imagine if they had to get towed out of there? All the trolls like you would be having a field day"
2021-04-19 23:12:22,wallstreetbets,"It’s a tesla battery, and nobody hates on Tesla. But for some reason Lordstown has so many haters I don’t really understand why. Maybe you are long on rivian or some thing"

That leveraged part bit me hard a few times and had to learn shit the hard way, which is normally the way I’ve always had to learn.  Think it’s called  “University of Hard Knocks” I think I’ve earned a degree in.  Gotta keep, pushing, keep trying and keep learning.

2021-04-20 13:51:32,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, it's probably pretty similar. There's an update of 25% ownership from 4 private equity funds in February (https://fintel.io/so/us/gme), the index fund custodians are probably larger as the stock has grown since the end of the year, and RC/insiders holdings are still about 23% on their own. So with 25% private equity (that we know of)+30% index fund custodians+23% insiders, that's at least 78% outside of retail accounted for in February."

Best luck to you sir."
2021-04-20 15:16:28,wallstreetbets,"Good for you!! You found THE stock to YOLO, from doing the research, and holding firm to your belief in the deep value of the stock and its ability to be a turnaround. Thanks to you and all the other OGs for letting us join you on this ride of a lifetime, all of your insights have been so great. Now it is all up to Cohen to deliver what so many see as a great new GME.

And thanks for all the RK spreadsheets you shared with all the aspects you tracked too. While reddit has been fun, the RK info you shared has truly been educational. You didn't stumble onto this trade...you mined the data, trusted your instincts and didnt blink with the highs or the lows, and when challenged as to your conviction in the stock, you ignored the sneering and doubled down.. over and over again. While others on wall street might have the bravado to do this with other peoples money behind a curtain,  you did it with your own money and in public on a world stage no less! 
For that, you are truly a legend - DFV, RK, Keith Gill...

Another reason from the bs lawsuit is that Fubo overvalued their assets, which As an accountant, that is such a dumb reason and shows that these lawyers are just fishing for anything or they’re just straight up stupid. They’re literally trying to sue Fubo because their asset value went down due to COVID reducing the asset value of pretty much every company lol."

If any of you have just flat-out shorted the stock, make sure to keep an eye on it and don't let it get away from you if things go the wrong way for my thesis.  My shorts are in at an average of 820.73, and I ended up with a position 3 times larger than I thought I would just because of that morning spike and how juicy shorting it over 820 was.

2021-04-20 16:55:00,wallstreetbets,"I sold a bunch yesterday, as well, but bought back towards the end of the day at the lows.  Which made today an average down day that turned into a ""this is too cheap, time for shares"" day."
2021-04-20 16:24:50,wallstreetbets,"Well, it's almost always time to go long on $ISRG.  This was a straight earnings play because all the data pointed to them finally taking one on the chin.  

&#x200B;

Like I said though, well played on their part getting everybody, including the analysts, to prepare for a down quarter only to blow the doors off it."
2021-04-20 17:01:53,wallstreetbets,I hope you're right on those shares.  The earnings report in early May has me thinking hard about a strategy.

2021-04-20 16:31:07,wallstreetbets,"Numbers already came out.  $3.52 a share.  They beat by more than a dollar.  New robots are up 20% year over year or some absurd number.

&#x200B;

They did really, REALLY well.  I couldn't have been more wrong on those earnings if I tried.  Happens about 15% of the time for me.  This is why I put in that big caution flag at the end and didn't barrel into it full speed like normal, though, knew this one was playing with a bit of fire."

2021-04-19 22:48:13,wallstreetbets,"Okay so I want to make sure I’m up to date. Clarify for me and correct me if I’m wrong:

1) No more *hellish ape thread*

2) No more *NEW* unpinned threads, but that honestly doesn’t mean anything for months, and there is now always the backup. And by the time the unpinned thread is gone, it ideally will no longer be an issue because the subreddit will be healed after all of the changes the mods are making.

3) Time limits for upvotes were temporarily added, with a two hour limit until upvotes would reveal themselves. Thankfully that’s been removed because that shit sucks, but it made sense as a decision.

4) Finally, in an effort to fully curb the situation with the subreddit being just an *apestonk* subreddit, only users who joined Reddit before January 1st, 2020 are allowed to post and comment.

5) Rich, Carrie, and Byte were all made mods.

Is there anything I’m missing?

6) u/Parker2020 pointed out that emoji spam and one word comments are now also automatically filtered.

EDIT 2:

7) A certain ticker for a fledgling small box video game retailer is also auto deleted.

2021-04-20 00:02:20,wallstreetbets,Honestly I’m just going to blame ghost downvoters from now on any time something I do or say gets downvoted.
2021-04-20 00:02:26,wallstreetbets,"Always hits around this time. My guess is the person gets into bed and goes on a downvote spree before sleeping which is really fucking sad. 

Smol pp energy."
2021-04-19 23:28:32,wallstreetbets,We have to get it to 69

2021-04-20 00:48:19,wallstreetbets,Why not use the other sub instead? Seems less complicated
2021-04-20 00:36:34,wallstreetbets,Well it *would* be unpinned at that point
2021-04-20 00:36:34,wallstreetbets,Shhhh
2021-04-20 00:38:44,wallstreetbets,That’s the smartest idea i’ve ever heard 🤭
2021-04-19 20:09:15,wallstreetbets,Wait what?
2021-04-20 18:18:05,wallstreetbets,What happened
2021-04-19 23:27:57,wallstreetbets,"The sauce master precedes the ghost pooper

They say the accounts will probably only be unable to post for less than a week. So you’ll probably be fine by the time you need to use it."
2021-04-19 23:34:54,wallstreetbets,To little karma
2021-04-20 16:12:40,wallstreetbets,Fuck off mate we’re dying over here
2021-04-20 16:29:07,wallstreetbets,Are you my alt?
2021-04-20 16:30:52,wallstreetbets,"What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I'm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little ""clever"" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo."

2021-04-19 22:25:58,wallstreetbets,You’re down 1 alt at least you have so many others
2021-04-19 22:55:13,wallstreetbets,Oh that’s how they were doing the trial?
2021-04-19 22:54:16,wallstreetbets,"That makes a lot of sense. Also tracks with when their activity in this thread changed. I had noticed but hadn’t thought anything of it. I’m glad to have them all as mods, even if still on a trial basis."
2021-04-19 22:55:58,wallstreetbets,Is 4 a permanent thing? One my crippled alts was almost of age 🥺
2021-04-19 23:02:27,wallstreetbets,Adding that. Explains why “BAN” is getting deleted right now. Hopefully not forever though.
2021-04-19 23:26:34,wallstreetbets,"Updated it. What a way to learn. Fucking beautiful. Finally. 

I wonder if they have even realized that their comments are getting deleted yet. It doesn’t tell them when they are."

2021-04-20 13:28:52,wallstreetbets,"Absolutely. But it’s worth it. Time to start taking care of myself again.

I would skin reveal but I’d have to find a way to do it without doxxing myself lol"
2021-04-20 13:32:42,wallstreetbets,"Absolutely will. One of the things I know I really need though is better moisturizing and redness control, so I need to introduce that in with my face washing.

Also bought a much nicer set of razors and a nice electric razor for just better care in general. I need to get a new pair of trimmers though, one of the handles on my beard scissors broke the other day."
2021-04-19 20:32:48,wallstreetbets,“They” are. I’m a little lazier
2021-04-19 20:33:23,wallstreetbets,"Good!  Rocky was da good boi at the vet today.  Just chilled and lost money except for my SPY puts.

2021-04-19 21:55:52,wallstreetbets,"Wasn't for health.  Just beginning of last decade, all the awesome pre-workout that gave you extra energy, focus, and numbed your muscles so you could go harder had a dmaa caffeine combo.  A lot of the other pre-workout were going the NO route...opened up your blood vessels instead of constricting them.   C4 was to take the space for peeps who wanted a stim boost, but couldn't handle the extreme stims / bugs crawling under your skin feeling.  My distributor specifically told me it was for women and small men ( gave me a good chuckle).  That's who I was recommended to market c4 too.

2021-04-20 00:07:42,wallstreetbets,It would make sense tho everyone else is sleeping and can’t upvote and the one downvoter(s) are just having at it
2021-04-20 00:06:39,wallstreetbets,Brilliant
2021-04-20 00:06:12,wallstreetbets,Calls on OIP probably laying in his ~~maple syrup~~ blanket like “these fucks are still posting here?”
2021-04-20 00:05:30,wallstreetbets,I wonder if it’s a frequent poster here just messing with everyone
2021-04-20 00:05:33,wallstreetbets,"Do we think they’re coming into the thread of just downvoting on someone’s profile?

Does downvoting on individual peoples’ profile even do anything anymore though?"
2021-04-19 23:28:56,wallstreetbets,But 69 😎
2021-04-19 23:29:13,wallstreetbets,Wait... how are you here?? Isn't your account too new?

I swear im not opening the news again for like a month lmao"
2021-04-20 18:23:15,wallstreetbets,Lots of people commenting about the trial verdict

2021-04-20 04:26:50,wallstreetbets,I say you just start posting your top levels as a reply to someone else's top level....but don't acknowledge what you're doing.
2021-04-20 09:35:19,wallstreetbets,So we can’t make top level comments? 😔

2021-04-19 23:37:23,wallstreetbets,Can confirm they are not. I had to check anonymously to see that it's not there.
2021-04-19 20:06:29,wallstreetbets,So *that's* where they all went!
2021-04-20 12:52:16,wallstreetbets,I have a separate portfolio for PLTR now 😂

2021-04-20 00:10:16,wallstreetbets,I would honestly stan
2021-04-20 00:07:11,wallstreetbets,"I thought that but it’s really consistent and idk no one in here is that lame. Like if it was someone here they would likely do it throughout the day not always same, specific time"

2021-04-20 01:05:34,wallstreetbets,"Unless it’s a new thread, you’ll lose people figuring out which older former pinned we’re going back to. Plus those have a higher comment count so they don’t last as long either."
2021-04-20 00:42:43,wallstreetbets,"Ok, maybe it’s the *second* 😏"
2021-04-19 20:17:00,wallstreetbets,It’ll be okay dude I promise.  The states were way worse off and we made it through...  even with 🤡.
2021-04-19 23:54:42,wallstreetbets,Just say “nice dog” on rising on r/aww on like four different posts and wait a few minutes

2021-04-20 09:37:45,wallstreetbets,"Don't think so. I've heard it'll only last a little while, though."
2021-04-20 09:48:43,wallstreetbets,Just comment “loophole” or something like that and reply to that comment if you wanna say something
2021-04-20 14:10:10,wallstreetbets,☹️
2021-04-19 22:59:30,wallstreetbets,I’m guessing we have at least a week but likely a month.

Edit: it did *not* work."
2021-04-19 23:40:05,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, that’s the thing. So it’s harder for them to realize. Probably just shocked their three letter upvote farm went away when they see no upvotes or responses"

2021-04-19 23:57:53,wallstreetbets,What’s even the point of commenting if I can’t use 🤡 😭
2021-04-20 16:36:00,wallstreetbets,Idk. It was just a guess

2021-04-20 18:51:07,wallstreetbets,It could drop to 22 😏
2021-04-20 18:54:36,wallstreetbets,I have 3 months of rent in cash and 3 months if I sell off my current shares. Things get real dicey if this doesn’t brake 33 by mid July.  🥴🥴

2021-04-19 21:00:58,wallstreetbets,I mean machines work but free weights are better since you have to use stabilizing muscles to hold the weights up. I prefer free weights over machines for most things but it’s all personal preference

2021-04-20 10:13:31,wallstreetbets,I own a lot of RAD and getting beaten up is the norm. Why can't management at least show a small profit?
2021-04-20 11:05:58,wallstreetbets,"A net profit is likely for the current fiscal year (2022) which began on February 28, 2021.

According to the company guidance provided for Q1 of this current fiscal year, RAD will post a break even result for the quarter +/- $10 million.  Such a result would represent a $63 to $83 million improvement in net earnings versus the result achieved in the prior year Q1.

The interest on the $3.1 billion outstanding debt is currently around $200 million per year.  That represents a roughly $3.65 per share negative impact on earnings.  So, as the company as able to continue reducing the debt load, it will see improved earnings from lower interest costs.

Finally, the acquisition of Bartell Drugs has made Rite Aid the #1 pharmacy in the Seattle area.  This acquisition is expected to be accretive a year from now, and should show a further positive impact to earnings then."
2021-04-20 10:14:46,wallstreetbets,"I'm in it for play 1, federal legalization is coming and there will be such a marijuana stock bubble. RAD sucks but is a steal at these prices."
2021-04-20 10:35:46,wallstreetbets,"Biden’s proposed ITC extension of another 10 years should help Plug get closer to profitability.  I believe the tax credit is also proposed to be increased.   Also, their first gigafactory is supposed to be online the 2nd half of this year which should reduce costs as well."

2021-04-20 02:22:21,wallstreetbets,"Looking at the day before I can see why you bought them. 

Rkt has been disappointing. I think it's going to rebound soon. I plan to reduce my position if I can get in the green. 

I've got too many longs that were meant to be short term. It's hard to keep track of them."

Lesson learned don’t invest the companies which don’t have sales and earnings. Think of NIO there are people entered at $3 and $60 both are happy since it has sales and growth.

I have rules about dd.

If I don't understand then I don't buy.
