Should I let you guys spend/guide my first option buy?

Edit 2:  if my account now shows an “options balance” does that mean I’ve been approved for options trading?  I have $100, what should I buy?"

2021-05-23 18:26:14,wallstreetbets,"Inflation bad.  Deflation way worse. 

Edit: there are few of any ways to deal with deflation effectively. I do not see any signs of deflation though. What exactly is causing you to suggest deflation?"
2021-05-23 18:31:17,wallstreetbets,Who uses log charts...? Although you're not wrong. If you add a wrinkle to your brain and use a semi-log graph and superimpose the dollar value onto the GME you'll find that the fed are going to anounce that $1=$7.30 on 20th September at 2:14pm.
2021-05-23 19:02:35,wallstreetbets,"I personally think the fed authorized naked shorting after 08.  In kind of a wink wink deal with hedge funds.  Think about it, dilution of everything from stocks to gold certificates.  They could literally print all they wanted and if those assets were getting diluted then there’d be no proof of inflation.  The hedge funds just got to greedy.  Explains why they never really raised interest rates in the last 10 years and golds only gone up 150$ an oz since 11 while the fed printed twice the money that was ever in existence since then."
2021-05-23 18:21:11,wallstreetbets,"I’ve always been under the influence that negative interest rates/deflation would benefit growth and tech stocks. It would most likely hurt cyclicals the most, but cyclicals have a chance to take off in a deflationary environment IMO because they can start to refinance their loans at lower interest rates."

Those areas were never really locked down, were they? I live in Florida and we only had a brief period of time in 2020 with a lot of restrictions. I imagine the Midwest had even less?"

2021-05-23 17:56:46,wallstreetbets,"You're looking at the velocity of money retard. It's been going down for ages. That's why we have been in a 'dEfLaTiOnaRy' period for a while even though some asset classes like real estate and equity have gone up heaps. It has more to do with productivity than it does with people having less money. It goes down when the economic output is lower relative to the money supply. M1 and M2 don't include stocks or houses. So if you hoard money, invest it or pay off debt more relative to spending it on goods or services it goes down."
2021-05-23 17:18:02,wallstreetbets,"Right, what’s all this then?"
2021-05-23 18:55:46,wallstreetbets,"I’m not sure you’ve totally grasped the role of money in our economy.  At bottom it is a means for sovereign governments to provision themselves.  They spend the money they create, then tax it.  The demand floor those taxes create on that money gives it value, and makes it useful as a medium of exchange."

2021-05-23 17:31:06,wallstreetbets,"Every human being lives on M1 & M2 money. It is the money people use to buy food and pay rents. When the percentage of M1 & M2 shrinks in the money circulation, people become homeless and starve. We changed our economic environment. When M1 & M2 drop so sharply, it becomes a toxic economic ecosystem. Everyone is affected, nobody is really out of this ecosystem. It is everybody’s problem."

2021-05-23 18:01:43,wallstreetbets,I’m long on this company I believe they have great long term potential. I also agree with OP this is primed for a short squeeze.  I think there’s many folks shorting them that don’t know the real potential and what positive news could result in.  Many just read Hindenburgs report and took it at face value.
2021-05-23 17:48:43,wallstreetbets,"This is the stock that WSB should squeeze- high short interest, represents an American come back story- they’re hiring so many people in lordstown and across the country and people on LinkedIn sound genuinely excited for the future, and it’s heavily attacked by wall steer, CNBC, and Cramer. When good news for RIDE comes up, I don’t see it broadcasted but any bad news it’s suddenly all over the place. Wall Street wants Ford to win and it’s so obvious"
2021-05-23 17:29:53,wallstreetbets,I’m deep in RIDE 🚀🚀🚀
2021-05-23 17:47:50,wallstreetbets,"$F held a hitpiece launch event seeking to undermine $RIDE last week.  

They promised better pricing and features.  They skipped over details like specification price points, and that deliveries aren't expected to start for a year (Spring '22 = as late as May).  

Specifications/option packages won't be defined by Ford until Fall (surely timed to undermine LMC final specs), and they will surely make the $90k models first.  It's also very easy to juice preorder numbers when you tell dealers to use the preorder website to reserve their stock.

IMO the Ford event was meant to advertise to fleet owners that they can wait a year or two on their EV upgrades, instead of signing up with LTM.  

$RIDE still has potential, but they are at a huge disadvantage when the $F CEO can mislead investors for stock pops in grand fashion with no repercussions, and  $RIDE can't mention preorders without defining the concept in the same sentence..."

2021-05-23 19:34:15,wallstreetbets,"For long term viability, how does LTM compete with Ford's production scale, and proposed pricing being cheaper than LTMs pricing for the truck? 

Another concern for longer term stakes in the company is there is a buttload of bag holders between 8 bucks to 30 bucks in the stock. To get enough momentum to get it back up and keep it up it's gonna need a big dose of the blue pill. Lotta investors are gonna be happy to bail as soon as they get close to lifting bags and keep the price down.

I'm interested in getting back in, but I haven't seen enough from the company to justify going back in other than potentially a dead cat bounce. Last week already surged 30% to stabilize it at a higher level."

2021-05-23 18:28:29,wallstreetbets,"> Timeline to Start of Production (SoP) in September 2021 remains on track, with beta prototype build underway and the first beta vehicles to be ready by the end of March.

This is a big yikes and red flag to me. They're beta testing a mass scale product end of MARCH and expect to be producing them at scale in SEPT?? 

Assuming 2 months of beta testing puts us roughly at today, there's no way 3-4 months from now they have incorporated any significant feedback...if there are any major design changes required, it will push their timeline out months.

Ford's timeline for their truck doesn't say to me that Ford is behind, but rather that RIDE is painting a significantly more rosy picture than reality is likely to bear out."
2021-05-23 18:11:40,wallstreetbets,"I only have 100 shares @ 9.9 and have been selling CCs these past week @ 10. Almost got called Friday lol. 


Why is the market cap not higher? It seems they won't be able to mass produce anytime soon due all the shortages. 

Also Tesla is doing partnerships with other companies to produce other types of vehicles like SUVs. Couldn't this crush RIDE? 


Yes I agree there's massive upside but like OCGN which I'm balls deep atm, I think there's a crap load of ""what ifs"" and risks short term keeping SP < 10. 


Its very far away from ""sure it'll go to the moon"" stock with the info we have atm and all the recent setbacks ..."

2021-05-23 19:10:01,wallstreetbets,It's no where near a mass scale product yet. Only looking to build 2-2.5k this year. This is how the legacies start to ramp up too. The timeline is perfectly viable if they execute.
2021-05-23 19:39:08,wallstreetbets,"Sounds like you need to wait to buy-in on Tuesday morning (after the Monday pm earnings call) so you are comfortable with the confirmations that will be given with regard to betas, testing, and production.
The company will produce the trucks and the stock will move up appropriately. I’ve been following it for months and when one understands the real DD it is extremely exciting."
2021-05-23 19:37:22,wallstreetbets,"That’s the risk you have to take to get the rewards! IMO all worth it at this moment. It’s not like they are producing 100’s of thousands of trucks so I’m sure they can get adequate supply of chips for the amount of trucks they will make this year. Also they are the only truck that is commercial focused this year, they will have no direct competition this year in that space."
2021-05-23 19:46:40,wallstreetbets,"No need to bet. Wait till Tuesday morning after Monday pm earnings call where you get the facts confirmed. You will miss being ahead of the pop in the SP but since only 20,000 orders would make a reasonable commensurate valuation a great deal higher than the current SP, buying in on Tues should prove to be a very wise move.  It is incredible to watch this story play out and being at the forefront of EV truck production with the govt working on a giant tailwind infrastructure bill.  I believe it is a “multiples” SP story over the next months."
2021-05-23 19:03:43,wallstreetbets,"all they have to care about at this point is making sure the truck is solid, there's no doubt in my mind there's enough demand* to cover for them making 30-35k trucks until the end of 2022 like they estimated"
2021-05-23 19:53:22,wallstreetbets,Hopefully we'll get excellent news and see some upside!!
2021-05-23 19:50:03,wallstreetbets,"Agreed, my only concern is how much time they'll need to ramp up production with everything that's going on and how that'll reflect on the SP. 


We might be around 10 for a while...

There are quality Technical Analysis DDs on SPY (sometimes other tickers as well) posted frequently here, with enough information such as support, resistance, bullish price target, bearish price target etc. Based on my recent experience, those DDs claimed to work and people make money.

What stopping you 10 million people to make money by simply following those DD? Why do you even need to find tickers? Why do you lose money?

2021-05-23 18:19:09,wallstreetbets,"Zim is a trader and he has a proven technique that works and makes him money. He says that it doesn't always work but most of the time it does work. Let's say most of the times means 60% (that's barely a most)

Zim started trading using his technique with $1K capital. He just makes one trade in a day with options and then stops. He is not greedy and very disciplined. He takes profit at 30% and cut his loses at 10%. So he makes a total of 200 trades in a year and 120 of them are winners. So he made-

**$1000\*(1.3)\^120 = $47,119,673,969,698,375.12 = 47,119,673.9 billion!**

Nope too much he does not have time to do 1 trading everyday. He only makes 1 trade a week. So he made 50 trades in the whole year and 30 of them are winners. So, he made-

**$1000\*(1.3)\^30 = $2,619,995.64 = 2.6 millions.**

Not bad! I mean some people makes millions within a good month here gambling but Zim did that with extreme dedications and discipline. Bravo Zim.

Now Zim loses the rest 20 trades. So, by the end of the year his actual balance becomes

**$2,619,995\*(0.9)\^20 = 318,530.30 = $318.5K**

That's like 31853% gain! Okay let's say Zim could not get out of his losing positions at 10% due to rapid fall. Let's say his loses were 20% (see I can say the same thing about the rapid rises where his market order could be sold at much higher price than 30%). Anyway 20% loss is then. Let's recalculate-

**$2,619,995\*(0.8)\^20 = $30,206 = $30.2K**

Well this looks kind of believable although it's 3020% yearly return!

Now at 3020% yearly return, making a single trade in a week, starting with only 1K, taking profit at 30% only and cutting loses at 20%, with only 60% winning rate how much money he can make in 10 years? Let's see here-

**$30206\*(30.20)\^9 = $631,183,597,920,198,084.43 =$ $631,183,597 billions!**

Fun question what is the GDP of the whole world?

**Well, you may say Zim is good at money management he take out 80% of the balance out of the market every year. Fair enough. After the 1st year he took out 80% of 30.2K and just started trading with rest $6040 and kept withdrawing 80% after each year. Let's see what happens now on 2nd year he makes-**

**$6040\*30.20= $182408 = $182.4K**

he then take out 145.92K and start trading with the rest. After 10 years he will have-

**$36481 \* (30.2)\^8 \* (0.2)\^7 = $ 323,096,495,781.17 = $323 billions**

This is just the money he will have as balance in his trading account excluding 80% withdrawal every year.

I want to be Zim. Give me a strategy with only 60% winning rate. That 60% has to be with every 100 trades. If you tell me that it works 60% but I have to make 287622548752547442 trades to get 60% then you know you are bullshitting.

&#x200B;

**There is no technique, no set up, no system that can make 60% profit consistently when the sample size are limited like 1000 trades or 10000 trades or even 100 billion trades. If there is such strategy then you can write a program implementing that algorithm and be the world's largest person within years.**"

Many women aren’t comfortable with their appearance (even 10/10 women I’ve met) so complimenting physical features doesn’t always go over as well as complimenting the style they put a lot of thought & effort into"

2021-05-23 17:23:19,wallstreetbets,"To grossly over simplify it: if you draw a chart with today's price and date and the options expiration price and date, with a straight line connecting the two, you'll see the rate the stock has to grow to maintain the current option price.

At any point the price is above that average linear trajectory, the option is worth more than you paid for it. At any date/price combination it is below the line it is worth less than you paid for it.

And of course there's IV inflation/crush, and many *many* other factors. But that's the simplest form.

Can make a ton of money buying options that never hit, if you know when to buy/sell.

When IV is super high, it's a good time to sell (and I've seen GME break 1,000% and 1,300% IV before on totally separate dates). When it's low, might be a good time to buy, as long as you have a firm belief on the direction the stock is going to move!

Not advice of course, just sharing my limited understanding."

2021-05-23 16:23:55,wallstreetbets,But the pivot...
2021-05-23 15:38:55,wallstreetbets,"Well, ""we're"" not ""bumping"" GME to anything. If you believe in the company it makes sense to invest in that company.

In terms of turning options into profit, gotta recognize when to buy 'em and when to sell 'em.

I very rarely go long on options without it being a part of a spread. Saw a strong buy signal on these based on my anal-ysis.

Considering picking up more if it stays under $30 this week (always hoping for a dip on the strats I'm confident on).

Do some math. Make some decisions. Track your progress. Don't let other folks tell you when to get in / get out. Hell I might be wrong, in which case you could make a killing inversing my play!"
2021-05-23 19:51:57,wallstreetbets,"Yep, in theory that's how it works!

But if the short seller sells a share they have not yet located to borrow (which they legally can as long as they have ""a reasonable belief they can locate the shares"") and then fail to deliver on such a borrow, then you get what's called ""Failure To Deliver"" which happens with billions of shares in the market. This happens because the short sellers have a certain amount of padding / extra days to deliver shares; during which both the original shareholder (who did not agree to loan the share out yet) and the short-sold-to shareholder (who purchased from the open market) have voting rights!

So yeah, there absolutely is a chance more votes than shares. Completely illegally, but totally within the confines of how the system is currently set up (loopholes and all)."
2021-05-23 17:04:28,wallstreetbets,"That's one way to look at it!

Another way to look at it is: 18 months for literally anything to happen that might drive the stock price up.

Already doing pretty alright with my paper gains here, and I'm feeling pretty good about June. And July. And Q3/Q4

And all of 2022."
2021-05-23 19:54:49,wallstreetbets,"Exactly the point in this move, my friend!

IV is dangerously low for the most talked-about stock on the planet.

My bet is that IV is currently about as crushed as it's gonna get in the short term."
2021-05-23 15:42:16,wallstreetbets,"Aye, final count hasn't been announced though. A lot of anticipation building over the next couple of weeks."
2021-05-23 15:49:04,wallstreetbets,Its not finalized yet.
2021-05-23 18:51:20,wallstreetbets,"Sounds like you could make a ton of money on call credit spreads, then!

Let us know how that goes."
2021-05-23 18:05:26,wallstreetbets,"Eh, got plenty of time to decide what to do with these."

2021-05-23 16:33:57,wallstreetbets,Why not just buy like 30 x $500's? for oct 15th? Way way way better of a play. Delta is better too.
2021-05-23 16:45:41,wallstreetbets,Question for the OP wouldn’t you want the IV and HV respectively to be higher in that sense your call will be  more volatile and worth more on a momentum swing
2021-05-23 15:58:19,wallstreetbets,You think you have more chromosomes than me?
2021-05-23 15:57:02,wallstreetbets,"That's funny. Because it went up. But what's the highest it can go?. By the logic of this call, my $7 2023 Nokia options should be through the roof."

2021-05-23 15:58:38,wallstreetbets,you are at least no fully retarded getting calls date 7 months out but 950 is still very retarded.
2021-05-23 17:26:58,wallstreetbets,"Oh okay so you're up and can make money by just selling the option to someone else, not from actually exercising the contract. That makes sense. Thank your for the explanation. Hundreds of other posts with gains make sense now. Do you find buying and selling options more attractive/lucrative than just holding options long term in order to exercise them?"
2021-05-23 16:14:32,wallstreetbets,Ya got balls none the least . I hope you make a shit load of money . Odds are ya just set it on fire though . Nobody thought it would shoot up to $450 so in the one in a million chance you are right 🍻

2021-05-23 17:01:59,wallstreetbets,"IV is an indicator which adjusts during / after the fact, not before.

High IV = high premium cost. Low IV = low premium cost.

For GME, anywhere around 100% IV is shockingly low. And with all the hype building for some key events in June, I'm surprised IV hasn't inflated much yet.

Options IV and resulting premiums have already started climbing (hence the paper gainz shown here).

If and when the price starts swinging wildly, IV will shoot up, inflating options prices with it.

If you want a forward-looking indicator, Max Pain theory is about as good as it gets, in my opinion."

If you don't exercise there is no need to deliver and nothing happens with the stock."

2021-05-23 15:46:02,wallstreetbets,"Eh, like I've said in my original thesis post: whether I'm a genius or a fool literally comes down to the outcome.

2021-05-23 16:47:32,wallstreetbets,These are 2023. No less retarded.
2021-05-23 17:40:55,wallstreetbets,"Buying and selling options is a zero-sum game. There is always a trader on the opposite side. One side makes money, one side loses money. Classic WSB vibes is to dump crazy cash on short-term out of the money options. And there may be 100 people who make money flipping the same option contract before it reaches expiration. Other times it starts losing money right away!

In my experience, and observation, long-dated options are way less of a gamble, as a stock can move consistently toward the strike/goal OR all at once do some short term crazy thing in favor of the option, and be profitable either way. Especially when IV is low.

Generally I prefer the thetagang strat for options (selling to the degenerates of WSB, as they say, especially when IV is high), but occasionally I see an opportunity to go long on an option, generally calls. I'm not big on betting against companies I dislike. More into making neutral to bullish moves on companies I do like."
2021-05-23 18:19:56,wallstreetbets,"I think you’re missing the part where long dated options can be very profitable even without being ITM. Just a spike in IV can make this drastically more valuable. Add in a spike in IV along with a spike in stock price and it’s an easy profit to sell with so much time left. You need to do some reading on options my friend

Edit- I highly doubt OP thinks this will be ITM and willing to bet he is just scalping calls"
2021-05-23 15:46:52,wallstreetbets,Huh.

2021-05-23 17:09:44,wallstreetbets,Just in RH; sold options to whoever wanted to own the stock and allowed them to get exercised. Wasn't an ape back then (and my shares in RH weren't really mine anyway).
2021-05-23 19:40:28,wallstreetbets,"Open interest is almost 1500. So definitely not huge, but clearly there’s buyers

2021-05-23 19:59:02,wallstreetbets,On yeah I forget about that stuff I trade in a tax free account. Don't have those worries.
2021-05-23 19:50:53,wallstreetbets,"> Open interest is almost 1500

Could you give a moment to explain what this means, and where you see it? From the words, I interpret ""1500 people are interested"" but that can't be what that means unless it's a calculated value and then, how's it calculated. Anyhow, what's that mean? 

And why does (bid/ask?) Spread imply OP needs a decent spike in price and/or IV"
2021-05-23 14:37:50,wallstreetbets,SPY is mostly growth/tech....
2021-05-23 14:42:18,wallstreetbets,"Isn't S&P horribly overpriced at these levels? most data comparable to dot com crash type numbers in terms of the CAPE and what not. 

Without a correction we will remain choppy af. I think we see the correction when covid protected mortgages start running out. Then again, once we get a surge on infrastructure announcement we will be well poised for a correction. Buy rumour sell news type of thing. 

Weird times."
2021-05-23 14:38:24,wallstreetbets,So you’re saying my 20 SPY 500c for Jan 28 might actually print?
2021-05-23 19:44:33,wallstreetbets,"nice analysis, lets see what happens. . .have a portfolio ready for all markets and holding is best advice, only have $$ in Mr. Market that you dont want for 3 years"
2021-05-23 14:47:25,wallstreetbets,"Well, I guess it depends. Sure CAPE is really high right now at something like 36/37, but the argument is that we've never had real rates this low and you have to take those into consideration. So some people have the perspective we could go much higher, like 45-50, but I think there's some consensus out there that with yields so low there's no where else to put your money.  

The pullback I've been looking for has been 7-10%, and while I'm not sure we finish the year higher I highly doubt we'll finish the year meaningfully lower."
2021-05-23 15:00:33,wallstreetbets,"Pass the blunt dawg, you’ve had too much"
2021-05-23 14:46:17,wallstreetbets,Quite the opposite.
2021-05-23 14:52:55,wallstreetbets,"I agree. I'm just saying this volatility recently for SPY bouncing around is prob what we should expect a good deal more of until that correction occurs due to being somewhat overpriced already. I do think we can get more overpriced tho, higher lows and higher highs. Moratorium for Covid protected mortgages run out June 30th, I expect the pullback/correction to happen at that point. 

Lots of red days lots of green days. I'm happy for the volatility. I'm doing really well w SPY options both ways rn."
2021-05-23 15:38:14,wallstreetbets,"Agree with pretty much everything here; that moratorium expiration is an interesting catalyst, thanks for mentioning that"
2021-05-23 16:13:23,wallstreetbets,Unsure if any significant amount of defaults will occur but the news that it's lifting should put some fear into the market.

2021-05-23 14:59:19,wallstreetbets,"You can with many brokers, on mine (Schwab) you can put in a limit order for premarket tomorrow (Monday) today (Sunday), and it should try to fill when premarket opens. But you can't do a market order, it must be a limit order. So you need to pick the highest price you're willing to pay and cross your fingers. Also, it may not fill anyway if it rockets too quickly above your limit strike.

EDIT: Oh, also, keep in mind a limit order on premarket will expire as soon as the market opens, it won't cover the entire market day."

2021-05-23 19:13:18,wallstreetbets,How much do you own?
2021-05-23 16:10:29,wallstreetbets,"I really, really don’t think so, I specialize in biotechs and the most common occurrence is a huge “sell the news” event on FDA approval. This has the same indicators: huge bull run the previous days, successful test flight, but no near catalysts, revenue or anything - this company will not have true profits until many years down the road. Hence, buy the rumor, sell the news. That’s why I predict a small spike to 23-24 on open maybe, and then a huge selloff.

Could be wrong tho, we’ll see."
2021-05-23 16:23:30,wallstreetbets,"To clarify, I don’t have positions in SPCE, sold for a very good profit (around 35%) on Friday. 

But, and this is a big but, I heavily invest in the biotech market since I’m a PharmD. And the most common thing that really fucks people over and especially new biotech investors is why the hell a stock goes down HARD after a FDA approval or a good trial result. They really don’t get what’s going on and end up holding HUGE bags for months, even years, until it gets back to that price. This always happens because the event was priced in and people just took profit since there weren’t catalysts in the near future. 

SPCE reminds by a lot of this situation since it had a huge spike last week and the successful event may already be priced in the same way, and people want to take their profits as usual, so... but maybe I’m wrong and if it goes “to da moon”, enjoy! I love SPCE as a company since I’m a huge airplane and space nerd. Wish I could get a ticket some day, lol."
2021-05-23 16:47:26,wallstreetbets,"LMAO!! No, that I can assure you it will not. Something more reasonable? Maybe. But especially not in this market where growth stocks are getting hammered, there is a lot of fear about inflation and interest rates, and taking into account that SPCE really will not have any revenue for years and its market is actually quite niche and small. Could it spike a bit? Yes. 100 a share? Definitely not."
2021-05-23 17:39:25,wallstreetbets,That's one expensive left nut sir
2021-05-23 17:09:23,wallstreetbets,Very true
2021-05-23 19:27:29,wallstreetbets,Open a 529 for that lil man and yolo in his name tax free or some shit.  I don't know how it works but its for education costs so I did it.
2021-05-23 18:54:37,wallstreetbets,Yeah that would be sweet. It would definitely pay for my student loans lol we can only hope.
2021-05-23 16:26:00,wallstreetbets,haha where are people getting this explosion from? have you been under a rock since 2014?? last time they just had a computer issues and glided back down with no damage.
2021-05-23 18:50:10,wallstreetbets,This is the way!
2021-05-23 15:26:12,wallstreetbets,"Only if it’s priced in.. as you can see VG was $60 and it kept dropping delay after delay after delay. IV causes a drop in price only when there’s little shorts and good news or priced in. 

Even after the flight was announced the shorts were so confident that it would fail or delay again due to weather. So clearly bad news was still priced in."
2021-05-23 16:15:24,wallstreetbets,We’ll see. He’s going to print tho.
2021-05-23 17:33:22,wallstreetbets,this is the FAA kid not the FDA unless you can eat a space ship. like a space chip.
2021-05-23 16:48:09,wallstreetbets,"This news wasn't known by insiders beforehand. So the successful test flight still isn't priced in.

 Combined with the waiting time before monday pre market, which gives investors time to think about their next investment into SPCE, we'll most likely see a big gap higher on the hype, shorts covering, MMS hedging, etc."
2021-05-23 19:02:20,wallstreetbets,It’s not biotech. Keep reading
2021-05-23 15:33:32,wallstreetbets,But Iv for may 28 calls was like 140 percent. Isn’t that high enough predicting that a move higher up is already expected ?
2021-05-23 15:34:25,wallstreetbets,Exactly now that there is no delay and the flight is successfull wudnt IV drop as there is less uncertainty ?
2021-05-23 16:18:07,wallstreetbets,"🤣 Again, maybe, nobody can truly predict the market, but 30 dollars is a tall order 💁🏻‍♂️"
2021-05-23 16:50:50,wallstreetbets,"Lol, you really don’t understand what priced in means at all. An FDA approval is never “known” until the day it happens, it doesn’t have anything to do with insiders, it’s just that people expect it or not, and thus is priced in. 

The SPCE test flight definitely seems a bit priced in, since it rose around 30% in 3 days. That is a huge spike, and what usually happens in biotech stocks, run up in anticipation - good news - take profit - crash.

But whatever, I’m not a psychic so I don’t really know 💁🏻‍♂️"
2021-05-23 15:43:07,wallstreetbets,"Also don’t grab may 28 calls, maybe skip 2-3 weeks ahead."
2021-05-23 15:42:38,wallstreetbets,"Well no Monday shorts won’t cover right away, a short squeeze takes days/weeks. Then Friday people will exercise their call options and call a gama squeeze.

Additionally this stock is waiting for the marketing to start after Branson is in space. That’s when this will likely see triple digits."
2021-05-23 17:01:30,wallstreetbets,"In an honest society all the parties keep it secret until the announcement is public and the insiders friends don't buy up large ahead of time. Your faith in humanity is commendable. 

But professionals in the biotech industry have a pretty good understanding of what will get approved when they submit. And they gamble accordingly. That's why you see the price go well beyond fair value before the announcement, and then return to reality after the uncertainty party is over. 

SPCE still has loads of uncertainty ahead, and the herd is stampeding higher. Maybe when the first passengers land the price will come down from $250 a share back to fair value"
2021-05-23 17:35:35,wallstreetbets,They only gave 2 days advance for this flight. If it was 2 weeks it would be over $30 easily. the FDA is not the FAA. VG just gave them their 400th successful commercial launch don't see them getting in the way of commercial launches anytime soon.
2021-05-23 15:56:40,wallstreetbets,I have may 28 calls that I bought on Friday. That’s why I’m asking
2021-05-23 17:04:31,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, you tell me since I’m a PharmD 🤣 You said it, these stocks go down when uncertainty is over (test flight) and the problem with SPCE is that it doesn’t really have any prospects of revenue in at least years, aka it’s all growth and hype, no value and crappy discounted cash flow metrics.

Still no use it using the crystal ball, we’ll see tomorrow. Could go either way 👍"
2021-05-23 18:45:06,wallstreetbets,"I see now, in that case sell enough of them on Monday so you’re able to afford exercising the rest. That way you’ll convert your calls into shares. Then Friday when the gama squeeze happens (call options being exercised heavily) you’ll be a part of that squeeze too at no risk if it doesn’t happen. Options are nice but if you stick to them you can lose it all, it’s nice to move from options to shares when you can."
2021-05-23 17:07:34,wallstreetbets,"There's massive uncertainty about how many rich people will pay big money to go on the ride of a lifetime. And with only a couple of minutes in space, I'd want to do it again."
2021-05-23 18:54:21,wallstreetbets,Do you think my calls can be up 200-300 percent tomm ?
2021-05-23 17:37:07,wallstreetbets,Agreed eddie. If you have the money you will be riding on all of the space ships you can afford. I don't see the guy who wins this blue origin bidding for the seat in October not wanting to go on other options later. Its like a rich persons Six Flags.

I don't think it has a use case (yet) when it comes to light transport, like cars and buses, but heavy transport needs to make a move. The likes of marine and air transport cannot work off electricity, and the same is true for other clean energy sources like wind/solar, alongside those current use cases you've already stated"

2021-05-23 18:19:16,wallstreetbets,"We been in the everything bubble since like post WW2. Markets can stay irrational longer than one can stay solvent.

Plus, what is an 'everything' bubble. There's still buyers at the current price. Just cause we are broke doesn't mean the wealthy are broke too.

2021-05-23 14:36:37,wallstreetbets,Tsla didn't sell
2021-05-23 14:07:18,wallstreetbets,I thought he tweeted Tesla didn't sell?  How you know he sold?
2021-05-23 15:02:05,wallstreetbets,"Where's their wallet to prove they didn't? What's the address?

He sold. Tesla sold.

It's all lip service."
2021-05-23 14:09:41,wallstreetbets,"he tweeted ""diamond hands""  cause he got so much back lash when he insinuated he sold. he changed his story twice. he sold trust"
2021-05-23 16:27:21,wallstreetbets,People lie.
2021-05-23 18:33:06,wallstreetbets,"Right, yeah. He def wants to defraud investors by point blank lying about significant assests"

2021-05-23 15:17:45,wallstreetbets,Maybe ya but the sec has been sitting on there ass doing nothing about a lot of shit they could step in on
2021-05-23 19:12:12,wallstreetbets,What's the Sec going to step in for its not a stock its a coin just outta curiosity
2021-05-23 13:03:04,wallstreetbets,How many accounts are you going to make?
2021-05-23 15:18:46,wallstreetbets,He keeps posting this shit. Last time he said he had 11k shares and wouldnt provide proof when asked proof or ban.
2021-05-23 16:27:30,wallstreetbets,Always looking for new positions that are worthwhile. That's why I'm on here. But a high of almost 46/share down to less than 16? You could be perceived as a bag holder trying not to get out at a loss.
2021-05-23 13:19:54,wallstreetbets,Honestly don't hear much about patients dying from bladder cancer.
2021-05-23 14:53:11,wallstreetbets,"People may ask how can I help people with cancer if the drug Anktiva is not FDA approved?  You can sign up for a trial which they have of various cancers.  You can ask to be treated under compassionate care program.  I recall Alex Trebek was under the regimen.  As you know, Trebek died of pancreatic cancer.  Regardless, he has tried previous standard lines of therapies and was on his last legs.  The experimental treatment did make him feel better and extend his life longer but the pancreatic cancer did catch up to him.  Not everyone is going to beat pancreatic cancer which is considered pretty much a death sentence with current methods.   So if anyone you know anyone that has cancer and have failed previous therapies, doesn't mean you're stuck, you can still sign up and get treated if all else has failed."

2021-05-23 13:07:36,wallstreetbets,Just one.  Article keeps getting deleted by moderators.  I'm just trying to get the word out.
2021-05-23 15:24:26,wallstreetbets,"He is still saying he has that many shares, so atleast he is consistent."
2021-05-23 15:21:57,wallstreetbets,"New here, how do I post a screen shot?"

2021-05-23 17:11:20,wallstreetbets,Keep an eye out going into Jefferies this early June.  They signed up for ASCO early this year.  So they're doing both the Jefferies Healthcare conference and ASCO back to back.  They didn't do ASCO last year.  Their pancreatic cancer phase 2 trial update is surely due after starting it about a year ago.
2021-05-23 17:05:25,wallstreetbets,Oh I'm a bag holder alright.  But I started buying when it was Nantkwest.  Plan is to hold the bag till over 100/share.
2021-05-23 15:23:05,wallstreetbets,My wife's grandpa actually did though it took a long time.
2021-05-23 13:27:40,wallstreetbets,It depends on what stage the cancer is found.  That's because they usually get treated with BCG first which for bladder cancer.  But the trial is for patients who have failed BCG therapy.
2021-05-23 13:44:46,wallstreetbets,"If article is being deleted, there must be a reason.  What reason did they give you?"
2021-05-23 13:50:09,wallstreetbets,Why must you get the word out now?  Does the company have a PR department that can release a news release if or when that drug is going to be on the market or past FDA approval?  Or do you need to pump it to get your money and sell?  Do you believe the drug will succeed or do have doubts or do you just want a quick pump so you can dump?
2021-05-23 18:17:26,wallstreetbets,That doesn’t say shit... it could be a paper account you just set up for all we know. Full screen or ban and I say we just go ahead and ban.
2021-05-23 16:10:34,wallstreetbets,"Good for him. I saw those patients back again and again. Most of the time, they just go to doctor's office. I'm not saying it's nothing. It does affect the quality of life, just way better than other common cancers."
2021-05-23 13:33:43,wallstreetbets,"I work at hospital. Seriously, I never saw one in 12 years. We do see a lot coming for surgery or chemo. Of course there are those who died from it. It's just not a very aggressive cancer."
2021-05-23 13:46:53,wallstreetbets,They said I was adding too many positives and no downsides.  They asked that I make the post more neutral in order for it to stick.
2021-05-23 18:33:21,wallstreetbets,How would I have just now set it up?  It doesn't have today's date on it.
2021-05-23 16:13:06,wallstreetbets,"No doubt it is a good cancer if there ever was a good one to get.  He was able to do all kinds of things and treatment was not that bad in comparison to others I have seen people go through.  I spent a ton of time with him as he lives near us and I had a job that let us hang out in the middle of the day and I was usually the one who took him to appointments.

Edit: I'm not even sure why you were downvoted about the not many people dying from bladder cancer, it is just stating the truth of the situation."
2021-05-23 13:41:58,wallstreetbets,"Yeah people will get BCG, chemo, or surgery for bladder cancer.  Obviously, people prefer to stay away from the ladder.  Chemo and surgery are obviously most common for pretty much all solid tumors.  The big take away is that IBRX got 71% complete responses meaning the cancer dissappeared for patients who failed previous therapies.  Anktiva's side-effects are very light compared to chemo so I would assume people would prefer that to chemo. IBRX is actually working on pancreatic cancer which is usually very aggressive.  They had really good prelim trial numbers reported in January.

2021-05-23 13:51:59,wallstreetbets,Nah.. I was an investor in the company since it was called Nantkwest.  I keep track of everything they announce publicly.
2021-05-23 14:25:20,wallstreetbets,"How much money do you have invested in this stock?  Do you think if you keep advertising this stock, prices will go up?"
2021-05-23 14:27:19,wallstreetbets,Have 11k shares.  I bought when it was Nankwest tho.  It's merged and turned into IBRX
2021-05-23 14:30:05,wallstreetbets,"If it's a good investment, why must you advertise it on wsb?"
2021-05-23 14:38:07,wallstreetbets,"Just to get the word out.  Have you heard of this company before this?  It may also help people who are dealing with cancer and running out of options.  Like I said, they had no bad news to announce and the price kept dropping.  Shorts?  It would nice if the shorts got blown out just like GME and AMC.  In a sense, GME and AMC brought me here.  But then again, IBRX has the potentional to be very profitable once you get that FDA approval.  I have my doubts about GME tho.  My friend is a gamer and he doesn't see the light at the end of the tunnel for them unless they change their business entirely but that's a different topic."

They also came out with a new proprietary battery that has 50% more power and increases production rate significantly over the tabbed batteries. Not financial advice since Im a retard and usually leverage/gamble and lose but i think you dun fukd up.

Edit: yeah i think its overvalued right now but with a few advancements it could blow past an ath imo. Assuming they continue to lead the race in innovation in those areas, i also see it as more than a car company. Not a tesla fanboy, i dont even like musk but ill still buy long arkk calls if it dips below 500$ which i think it will."

It will probably jump when they release it and maybe drop after. 

Edit- never mind. I thought I saw news of the release but I must’ve read it wrong. 

0-60 in 1.1 seconds and 620 mile range. But no news on release date. Drivable prototypes and early production prototypes this summer though.

Edit 2- it’s the model S plaid being released June 3rd.

0-60 in 1.9 seconds and 520 mile range."

He shorted tesla at 550 and it went to 900. If you had followed him, you would have been margin called and blown up your account.

It's easy to look smart when you have enough capital to eat a billion dollar loss and think you are skilled at the market for mistiming your short position by nearly 100%"
2021-05-23 16:20:58,wallstreetbets,No he didn't. He started shorting around when TSLA was $570 in early December. Learn to do some digging before parroting few talking points automatically man.

Every other car manufacturer is buying batteries second hand and Tesla is inventing new batteries with better range and manufacturing them themselves. 

Fucking dream on dude. Stock price correction? Sure. Maybe.

They’re not just a car company. 

They make cars, batteries, and software. That’s 3 companies in one. Vertically integrated."

2021-05-23 14:50:35,wallstreetbets,You guys get so hung up in profits which isn't even my point. There has to be a road to large profit margins or profit in order to be valued as a growth stock.

Cars are an incredibly capital intensive business and Tesla isn’t spending a whole lot of money retooling their car designs. They don’t have any EV credits anymore, FSD is just vaporware, and the Big Boys are all getting into the EV space in force.

Elon is very optimistic about Model Y becoming their highest-selling model seeing as all 4 Giga factories will be producing it (as opposed to just 2 for the Model 3). 

It might be a while before the stock will reach ATH again but I doubt the biggest EV company won’t continue to innovate and expand."

2021-05-23 16:06:49,wallstreetbets,"Sure. They’ve also invented a bulletproof cyber truck. Except that was almost two years ago and I still don’t see any on the roads. Where have all those customer deposits gone to, do you suppose?"
2021-05-23 15:41:46,wallstreetbets,"What has Tesla done? Outsource pollution to the DRC and Mongolia in the form of terribly polluting mining and disposal practises for battery metals? Incentivize the increased burning of fossil fuels in areas without baseload nuclear power to charge the batteries?

Just because you can’t see pollution coming out of a tailpipe doesn’t mean it’s not happening. It just means that it’s being shifted somewhere else"

Turned out to be a 10k gimmick that only 1 in a million tesla owners can even beta test. here we are years later with next to no improvements. Many TSLA owners aren't even comfortable using smart summon in an almost empty parking lot.

As they have failed deadlines autopilot technologies are swiftly closing the gap supercruise and blue cruise and others, and they're doing it at a fraction of the price. Top off with a CEO making the worst choices possible this year and caring more about neuralink and SpaceX than tesla motors and you have, well, what they've been having all year. The blind bullishness of young investors towards them is blending into sunk cost fallacy, and I'm tired of seeing people losing a lot of money on them thinking otherwise."

2021-05-23 18:20:34,wallstreetbets,"1. Musk has pushed dates in the past. Ford generally meets their deadlines.
2. They're about the same price but ford has more tax credits left. 
3. The F150 looks like a truck
4. People have driven F150's before and know what to expect
5. 3rd party add-ons like racks, canopies, tool boxes, etc will already work with the F150.

Tons of advantages to the Ford. It's already the most popular vehicle in the country and now it will be able to do just about anything a Tesla can do. Not something I'd want to bet against."
2021-05-23 16:13:13,wallstreetbets,I’ll believe it when I see it. Tesla is a show me story - and they haven’t really produced a lot in terms of promises vs results for a few years now
2021-05-23 17:54:57,wallstreetbets,Can't argue with that logic
2021-05-23 16:36:01,wallstreetbets,"Lol seriously? Model 3 - “they’ll never hit production goals. They can’t mass produce.” 

Tesla - hits model 3 goals of 5,000 per week. A bit delayed. But they did it. In 2018. Now they make 15,000 per week. A growth rate of 300% in just 2-1/2 years. 
 
During a global pandemic. 

And on top of that, they started the model Y. And they still produce the model S and model X. And the model S got an update. And now they’re releasing the new model S plaid in a few days. 

Tesla delivers. 500,000 cars per year."

2021-05-23 17:25:40,wallstreetbets,How many EVs?
2021-05-23 18:06:23,wallstreetbets,"1. Why does that matter?
2. Check back in 2023 when we have the numbers for the F150 Lightning. I suspect a lot. They sell \~1 million F-150's a year. If even a fraction of those end up being electric then already they'd be knocking on the door of the most prolific EV brand. They'll also be selling a hybrid F-150."
2021-05-23 19:57:32,wallstreetbets,"I suspect far less than you think, considering they're still having trouble sourcing the required microchips and batteries. Like another posted above, Tesla is vertically integrated in EV manufacturing. Ford, as of now, is not. They can make frames and bodies like crazy... doesn't help much if they can't put in the parts that make an EV electric."

Edit:  Just looked at the charts. I think you've got a little more room to grow. Might still be worth taking a little off the table though because anything can happen. The stock could have everything right and dip for seemingly no reason. Plus you're up 100% what more do you want."

2021-05-23 15:55:44,wallstreetbets,"Fun story time. Grab a cold one and get ready.

I got in nearly perfectly before the initial BB hype caught on. I had 8C's + 10C's. Was even responsible and took some profits and rolled half the 10's into 15C's....I was jacked to the metaphorical tits to say the least...

I even told someone ""I've got a 1600% unrealized gain on BB calls""...the day was 1/27, shit was popping off...do you think I sold? **Nope!** Not even when it was a 2000%+ gain.

Fast forward several hours. All throughout that day I could have sold at great exit points and just taken the money and run. Even on 1/28 there were several hours where I could have taken insane gains before RobinHood did their rug pull bullshit https://finance.yahoo.com/news/robinhood-bars-users-from-buying-game-stop-stock-infuriating-its-users-144007484.html

I was aware they had blocked GME buying but because of the frenzy and my head not being clear, I didn't know they blocked BB too. Not that it would have changed anything because I'm too stupid to understand second-order effects. ""Oh, people can't buy? I can't believe it! That's outrageous!"" is as far as my degenerate monkey brain got. 

Only afterwards was I able to understand that not being able to buy implies only being able to sell. (Or hold, but let's be real...apes together strong is bullshit, this isn't a team sport). If I didn't make the logical leap to step 2, I certainly didn't make it to step 3 which was: if people can't buy, and can only sell, then the price will go down bigly because of supply and demand.

All I needed to do was set some reasonable limit orders...or at least a stop loss. To have some kind of a plan.

But I somehow got it into my head that it could go to $40. It never even occurred to me think about *why* it was up so much and how precarious it all was. It had gone from $4...to $6...to $8...to $25+ in a matter of days. My brain thought that was somehow totally normal and it would be reasonable to not take *any* gains and to expect it to go up even more. 

Keep in mind I got in after *skimming* some DD, no reason other than people saying ""you son of a bitch, I'm in"" -- yet somehow I fell in love with and believed deeply in a stock I had owned for only a few days and had no thesis about.


Don't be me. I couldn't imagine or internalize it at the time, but PLEASE TRUST ME...*not* taking gains (and even going to $0, as I ended up doing) is MUCH MUCH MUCH more painful and psychologically damaging than missing out on potential upside. Sure, that will always feel bad and you'll kick yourself, but nowhere **near** as much as the soul-crushing regrets that will haunt you every single day afterwards forever if you don't take the money and fucking run.

If you care about yourself, your mental health, and your financial future...don't be me."

They also have thinkorswim which is really cool if you're new to investing (or experienced and want to test a theory or strategy) You can use a ""paper account"" within thinkorswim to try out what-if plays on stocks, options, futures. It's an exact simulation with real data, execution, etc. It really helps you apply things you're learning (options for example) into a ""real"" trade to see the  results."

2021-05-23 16:23:42,wallstreetbets,"If IV drops during the day, it will null out the intrinsic price increase. IV closed at roughly 130% on Friday. Space normally floats between 90-120%. In other words, if SPCE goes up by $1 but IV goes down to 120%, your option would probably also decrease in value because extrinsic reasons. I don’t think IV will increase on Monday through the day but I could be wrong. It’s better to take the profits when you can! 

If you had a longer term call, say January 2022, then you could hold through the IV crush and wait out the price increase, wait for the next PR boost or flight and ride the IV up and then sell. But with a June expiration, it’s just too short hope for another IV push up."

2021-05-23 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Why I'm Large and in Charge for Dick Kings (DKNG) Hey retards, it's been awhile since I've posted an actual DD, but I'm back (had to repost this cause mods). Before I start, he's my [track record](https://www.markovchained.com/profiles/view/reddit:TheHappyItalianMan), you can obviously check my post history too. I wanted to added upon my post earlier today, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nimruw/im_gay_for_dick_kings_dkng/). My DD's generally end up in the right direct, but this current one will be my largest bet to date. So here we fucking go my fellow autists. You ready to learn about Dick Kings?  Whats the fucking play? It's DraftKings (DKNG). **$DKNG 100c 1/21/22**

[POSITIONS HERE I AM AUTISTIC](https://imgur.com/gallery/7ZK85CN)

In this post, I will breaking down ***what is DKNG***, providing an up to date ***SWOT*** (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats) ***Analysis***, looking at a screenshot of their ***fundamentals*** and a deep dive into their current state of ***Technical Analysis*** *a*nd if you don't understand any of this yet, don't worry there's a tl;dr at the bottom for you really *\*SPECIAL\** investors.

[www.draftkings.com](https://preview.redd.it/gpkamsly2w071.jpg?width=850&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e7aba9b539db4d87fb7239a78f7e55bc2fc65f17)

**DraftKings** is an American daily fantasy sports contest (dfs), sports betting operator (sportsbook), and virtual casino platform (igaming). Essentially it's a fucking money pit for retards who have gambling addictions, and according to a [Harvard Study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK230631/#:~:text=Based%20on%20its%20analysis%20of,activities%20in%20the%20past%20year) conducted in fucking 1997, approximately 1% of adults have gambling addictions, I'm sure with todays ease of access, it's more like 2%, so, \~6.6 million retards are at severe risk to giving DraftKings their bank accounts. Like I said, this shit is a money pit, they provide a service that results in LITERAL FREE MONEY. Instead of driving to a casino, these geniuses at DraftKings are allowing some individuals to gamble from the comfort of their couch, it's amazing. Also, when I say retards, take that lightly last Saturday, I gambled away, and streamed myself in an undisclosed off-brand WSB discord, $500 in an online casino, and gamble on sports, daily, hell, last NFL season I finished first in the r/sportsbook betting contest. [PROOF (i love gambling)](https://imgur.com/gallery/woD8Vpu). With that said, if you like something buy it, if you love something invest in it. I love gambling, and will invest in the BEST *legal* sports book out there, DKNG, aka Donkey Kong, aka Donkey Dick, aka Dick Kings. :kek:

**SWOT ANALYSIS of Dick Kings**

**STRENGTHS:**

* Industry leaders: currently DKNG is legal in more [states](https://sportsbook.draftkings.com/help/sports-betting/where-is-sports-betting-legal?wpsrc=Organic%20Search&wpaffn=Google&wpkw=https%3A%2F%2Fsportsbook.draftkings.com%2Fhelp%2Fsports-betting%2Fwhere-is-sports-betting-legal&wpcn=help&wpscn=sports-betting%2Fwhere-is-sports-betting-legal) than any other sportsbook platform, they're legal in 11, with 2 on the brink of legalization, and a window of opportunity by eoy for the remaining 11 states where it is legal.
* Marketing/Advertising: if you're a sports guy, you'll noticed DKNG is fucking everywhere, you cant escape it. They're all over social media and are on every fucking commercial.  They spent 77% OF THEIR [REVENUE ON MARKETING PLATFORMS LMAO](https://www.actionnetwork.com/legal-online-sports-betting/draftkings-reports-increased-revenue-marketing-2020-earnings).
* Partnerships: They currently have a partnership with the NFL, UFC, MLB, three [NBA teams](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.draftkings.com/about/news/2020/02/draftkings-signs-multi-year-partnerships-with-three-nba-franchises/?wpsrc=Organic%20Search&wpaffn=Google&wpkw=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.draftkings.com%2Fabout%2Fnews%2F2020%2F02%2Fdraftkings-signs-multi-year-partnerships-with-three-nba-franchises%2F&wpcn=about&wpscn=news%2F2020%2F02%2Fdraftkings-signs-multi-year-partnerships-with-three-nba-franchises%2F), and they own a [Nascar](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.nascar.com/news-media/2021/05/20/draftkings-joins-nascar-star-bubba-wallace-23xi-racing/). Not only that, but Disney (ESPN) has a 6% stake in their company, yeah the largest sports network in America owns a [6% stake of DKNG.](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.streetinsider.com/dr/news.php?id=17950769) (dont fuck with the mouse). They also have upcoming partnerships with Dish Network, and I'm sure they have a fuck ton of other promotions on the way.
* Ease of access: you literally type it in the browser, or download an app. Deposit you wage cuck check through paypal or via debit card and within 1 hour your entire check could be gone, it's that easy.
* UI: You know how everyone says, ""oh don't use robinhood, it's bad, it's so cancer, they sell your data."" Shut the fuck up, you know that UI is fucking sexy and that's why you keep buying FDs that's the same shit with DKNG. I've used hundreds of online casinos and sportsbook, personally bovada is my go to, but for legal books, DraftKings is by far the best, no question. That platform is sexy, look how clean this is compared to fanduel.

[dark mode. NICE COCK](https://preview.redd.it/izc1z4433w071.jpg?width=994&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eb103c557913ee7284b132ddabaa2254c62518fc)

[disgusting light mode??? wtf is this trash LMAO. srs?](https://preview.redd.it/o1b0ydg43w071.png?width=1001&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d690151a2c8518715623b5e8770eaf2b99d1aa2)

**WEAKNESSES:**

* They care too much, and try to hard to make as much money as possible? wtf? you thought imma drop actual weaknesses, imma straight shill. No thanks LMAO. Fan Duel, Barstool sportsbook is straight trash. dafuq.

**OPPORTUNITIES:**

* State Legalizations, currently there are only 24 states where sportsbooks, igaming is legal, but it's expected to be legal nationwide in the next 1-3 years. Maryland, Nevada, Connecticut, Florida, Indiana, Ohio and New York are on the brink of having DKNG in their states. I know a few of those states legalize literally just last week.
* Partnerships, with the amount of money DraftKings is spending, they're going to have deals with the NHL, NBA and possibly even some college ball in the next few months. I wouldn't be surprised to see DKNG become the official sportsbook of the NFL in the future. I know a few [stadiums](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.giants.com/news/draftkings-and-new-york-giants-announce-official-exclusive-sports-betting-deal) offer DKNG sportsbook in stadium, and I think this will become the norm in the next few years. You'll be able to go to a ballpark, stadium and place your bet directly there right next to your $40 beer (cause inflation).
* Social Media. I think where it stands right now, if you google DraftKings, their social media platform is okay, but in the next few months, especially near NFL season, it'll absolutely explode. They obviously have a facebook, twitter accounts, instagram and they are extremely interactive, they have daily podcasts and shit, but that's all so new. Their accounts are all growing, and I know as their social media presence becomes established, their brand name will grow as well.
* Buyouts, again, as a I said above Disney has a 6% stake in DKNG, I wouldn't be surprised to see Disney too onto their ownership and possible even buyout Draft Kings, I mean, imagine that. Disney, ESPN and DraftKings, all under the same parent company. That would be insane. You don't see Barstool (Penn), or Fanduel with that kind of opportunity.
* Igaming, I think this platform is so slept on. Virtual casinos are the fucking future, let me tell you, I've been doing this shit for years and once you legal bros get into this shit, you'll be hooked. There's absolutely nothing better than sitting your fat ass on the couch and blowing through hundreds of dollars betting martingale on black 7 times in a row. SHIT IS FUCKING GREAT. If they can develop a strong Igaming presence, they'll be loaded. Igaming is \~$[250 billion industry](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/gaming-market-2020-2025-size-share-trends-growth-value-and-research-report-2021-03-03?tesla=y#:~:text=Looking%20forward%2C%20the%20global%20gaming,Mobile)

**THREATS:**

* Their only threat is competition, which is actually a strength because their competition is dog water. Barstool Sports can't get a partnership with the largest revenue sport, the NFL, because the NFL commish Roger Goodell absolutely hates the face of Barstool, aka Portnoy. I love Portnoy, but guy is a week away from some fucked up-cocaine induced canceling, I'm telling you. Barstool will entertain the stoolies, but they'll never become the Mcdonalds of fastfood, they'll always be the fucking nasty ass trash Burger King that you have to go to because the Mcdonalds line is too long. Fanduel is owned by a UK company, what do they know about American sports. WHAT COMPETITION.

**Fundamentals -** lotta pictures incoming

Their revenue has absolutely gone bananas in Q1, which is fucking insane, because there were some rumors that DKNG lost a fuck ton of money from the [superbowl](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.nhbr.com/the-brady-effect-new-hampshire-lottery-sacked-in-super-bowl-betting/#:~:text=State%20takes%20a%20%243%20million,the%20Bucs%20and%20their%20QB&text=While%20New%20Englanders%20bet%20heavily,hole%20on%20Super%20Bowl%20Sunday). Anyway, as you can see their revenue grew a dick-ton. The big scary here is their net is horrible, why, the big no no? Sales and Marketing. I was worried about that too, but that's their game plan, to a spend a fuck ton of money to game market dominance early on, retention rate is key to this industry. Jason Robbins their CEO said it on a [podcast the other day](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly93aGVyZXRoZW1vbmV5aXMubGlic3luLmNvbS9yc3M/episode/Nzg3ZDM1Y2QtMTgxYS00ODBhLTllZGMtMzFmZDdlNWNlMTIx?hl=en&ved=2ahUKEwisjdvGtt7wAhWKUt8KHVAoCCkQjrkEegQIBBAI&ep=6), they're in preseason, training camp in this market. They're still warming up to the full opportunity.

[https:\/\/draftkings.gcs-web.com\/news-releases\/news-release-details\/draftkings-reports-first-quarter-2021-results-and-raises-2021](https://preview.redd.it/4w1istie3w071.png?width=1241&format=png&auto=webp&s=6116ae4857dac73c83688feb1796471896cdaac8)

So to touch upon their spending again, as you can see their spending is working. They gained new degens at a rate of 114% compared to the first quarter of 2020. INSANE GROWTH. They're growing and retaining rates at a crazy level.

[more good. less bad.](https://preview.redd.it/ezqljieg3w071.png?width=1201&format=png&auto=webp&s=690df56ebd62a93b9ec73feaad69223f02f07997)

tl;dr REVENUE PUMP. They're expected to blow revenue out of the water, shit is going full parabolic. Raising revenue guidance to $1.15 billion,

[25&#37; of the population](https://preview.redd.it/3qlsfe9i3w071.png?width=1211&format=png&auto=webp&s=ada7e5758aa5e16c10bb0f90170e996b885bade9)

DKNG only has access to 25% of the U.S. population as of right now, and the stock is at what $45, what till this shit nation wide.

[https:\/\/draftkings.gcs-web.com\/static-files\/4d3d4ba2-b2e0-4081-bb6c-7c74f6cc2145](https://preview.redd.it/em8i3xik3w071.png?width=959&format=png&auto=webp&s=e2f7b6e7ce522ac05036a0084169e95c014b7bd9)

No dilution until $135 a share, and you aren't buying this absolute diamond right now? wtf.

&#x200B;

**Price Targets**

[https:\/\/www.tipranks.com\/stocks\/dkng\/forecast](https://preview.redd.it/r13pqcbp3w071.png?width=1138&format=png&auto=webp&s=47959e0448a1ab6c6b30b2488d8814b7df3ccb69)

DKNG is sitting pretty right above their low price target at $42.00, and you aint buying? Look at these price targets, a ceiling of $105.

&#x200B;

**Institutional Ownership**

[Disney](https://preview.redd.it/fpk8uzlr3w071.png?width=1037&format=png&auto=webp&s=377c457af3927b4d7ff5396d147235738138e07a)

Look at the dates of filing and values. A lot of the media is shitting on Cathie Woods for buying DKNG religiously, but nobody is shitting on BlackRock for owning over 8million shares. As a wise man once told man, BlackRock is the United States testicles, they are the balls of this country. If they buy something, you know that shit is going to cum to the moon. It's insane how many of these big names are buying right now.

**Technical Analysis** so I hate to be the guy, but this is the [only stock I've traded all year](https://web.archive.org/web/20210523102613/https://www.tradingview.com/chart/DKNG/u6wmRMkT-What-s-next-for-DKNG-Part-2/).

SHORT TERM(1-3 months):

[wedge, no vol.](https://preview.redd.it/ueoiofxw3w071.png?width=1147&format=png&auto=webp&s=0806df6ce5521a17081b3a632be2b02361c355e4)

As you can see from the chart above, we're currently trading in between the 7d sma and 50d sma on the 2hr. This is most likely complete confirmation bias, but I backed tested when DKNG has a daily closed inbetween this same crunch since it drooped the spac name, and whenever it has this same set up, these are the next day, and or two day returns.

02/10 +10.48% , 03/04 +13.89% , 03/25 +1.62% , 07/16 +9.46% , 09/09 +9.11% , 11/05 +9.05% , 1/08/21 +4.48% ,3/10/21 +11.48% , 04/26/21 +1.91%

Try it yourself. This is actually the reason why I bought weeklies eod friday. Check my positions at the top. I think in the next few weeks, DKNG will go to that top level resistance line at \~49.5, and then it could trade sideways for a bit longer to fill that volume gap from 44.5 to 49.5, but I do think a pump day is coming nonetheless.

&#x200B;

LONG TERM(3-12 months):

[Support \/ Meme Line](https://preview.redd.it/014ln9o04w071.png?width=1147&format=png&auto=webp&s=845d45afafea0c86a25b60729e5039fb328d1c45)

[RSI oversold](https://preview.redd.it/lsnl6oo34w071.png?width=1147&format=png&auto=webp&s=f843db525edb8cac78c82849e727b6dac367a342)

[MACD reversal](https://preview.redd.it/o62fqra44w071.png?width=1147&format=png&auto=webp&s=f65a6cc9e82f4f82abc03614eebe3d34d9a3b34b)

So, longterm (3-12 month window), referring to the chart at the top, it looks like DKNG has found support off the 35.5 bottom it hit in September, there's massive volume support at the 42.5 line, and that looks to be the new floor (god forbid a market crash happens soon, plz no fomc june 18th taper tantrum). It looks like the next major test for DKNG is at the 200d SMA or 51.52. If you look at RSI, it's leaving oversold territory, and MACD is flashing a reversal. I think we're due for a next wave of highs on DKNG. I could see this popping to \~49.5-51.5 -> \~60 -> all time highs. TA is looking dumb bullish you fucking idiots. Buy this shit. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**CONCLUSION**

in conclusion, I fucking love the stock. Technical and Fundamentals showing a strong buy. Dick Kings is about to cum, and be sure you're there to catch the cum, because once this thing is near it's edge, it's going to absolute nut. I know I wont want to miss suc.. am I gay? anyway. buy dkng.

I use these gambling apps and I just shop around for the best odds/promos. They are all falling over themselves to get/retain customers that they are hemorrhaging money. Maybe I'm an anomaly but I made thousands in profits last year by leveraging all of the basically free money promos.

2021-05-23 17:16:27,wallstreetbets,Yessir
2021-05-23 15:04:19,wallstreetbets,They need to be #2 or #3 to get a slice of the pie and bring in another source of income. MGM’s casinos are coming back including Macau in China. You have a better approach to the gambling sector when you combine Casino and online revenue. I want to be positioned with the best company why would I leave out the casino sector and just focus on online gambling? Why not both? MGM would be the ideal choice at their current price and recent analysts upgrades.
2021-05-23 18:53:19,wallstreetbets,"Because I’m too lazy to read this entire post, but didn’t see it in your counter section, isn’t their debt at like insanely high amounts?"
2021-05-23 15:22:44,wallstreetbets,"MGM is an established casino company. They have land casinos so doesn’t PENN. Those will always be profitable establishments and they aren’t going anywhere. What limits the two of them is they aren’t solely focused on expanding mobile gambling and igaming like Fan Duel and DKNG.

MGM’s approach is to wait for states to legalize and drop books a few months after legislation.

DraftKings plan is to establish a presence in the legislative process, and be the FIRST bookie offered in that state. 

Igaming and sportsbook market is the future of gambling and has the potential to be a $500 billion industry in the next 10 years. When people have ability to gamble from their couch they will go to the first book that was offered to them, hence, First to Market Advantage. 

Also, DKNG recognizes that the igaming and sportsbook industry is more complicated than just gambling from your phone. It is literally the next big tech, and they’re willing to make partnerships with these massive companies like ESPN, like Dish Network, possibly Fubo or Netflix to become another tech giant. I dont think MGM has that ambition.

tl;dr DKNG wants to become a tech giant.
MGM is comfy. I truly believe DKNG just has more upside in the market i’m looking to invest in, igaming and mobile gambling."
2021-05-23 19:16:49,wallstreetbets,"DraftKings has literally zero debt, and over 2 billion in cash. You're probably thinking of their ugly step-brother, Penn national, who is saddled with debt and whose sp was lifted only by goofball Stoolies who have never heard the word Balance Sheet."
2021-05-23 15:28:03,wallstreetbets,MGM stated in their investors presentation in April that they’re after this mobile gaming market https://s22.q4cdn.com/513010314/files/doc_presentations/2021/05/BetMGM-Investor-Day-Presentation-2021.04.21-(Posting).pdf
2021-05-23 15:29:29,wallstreetbets,Actions speak louder than words. Thats why DKNG and Fanduel were the only bookies at the Florida sports gambling hearing on Monday. They’re committed to this market.
2021-05-23 15:40:26,wallstreetbets,"I’m not too sure that just online gaming can bring DKNG stock back to a break out of their all time high. WYNN, CZR and my pick MGM are going to always have an advantage and with them tapping into this mobile betting market it will significantly drive their revenue higher and it will reflect in the stocks price. DKNG can climb higher but but can it outperform the likes of MGM in 12 months?"
2021-05-23 15:56:39,wallstreetbets,"At a bare minimum, I think if DKNG can sustain their current handle on this market, with the rate this market is expected to grow, DKNG revenue will 5x what it is now within the next 1-2 years, if states continue to legalized at it’s current rate. They only have access to 25% of the population right now. 

Regardless, we’re talking Apples to Oranges. You’re talking land casinos, i’m talking tech. MGM has no drive to become a tech company or tech partner like DKNG. Regardless, as where it stands right now, MGM is only in 9 states compared to DKNGs 11, so yes I think DKNG currently is and will continue to be a better option for the igaming and mobile market due to their aggressive rate of expansion, retention rate and company partnerships (ESPN.. NFL etc). 

Hell, MGM isn’t even eligible for the NY auction as of rn, neither is PENN for that matter."

2021-05-23 19:25:43,wallstreetbets,I'm with you. The trend since mid-Nov. is out of range. Not healthy. Drunk teenagers. Needs to fill that April 5 gap up. Another gap that is interesting is 5/18/2020. There has never been a gap that size on the SPY that did not fill in the last 20 years (that I found). It's down around 290 and may look at crazy talk but whoever knew that you would be able to draw a straight line from the low 2/2018 to 12/2018 low to 3/2020 low. Straight line. Never would have thought it.

2021-05-23 13:58:31,wallstreetbets,Yeah looks like he's trading in vanguard in which to write that kind of put you'd need over 2 million in margin availability.
2021-05-23 10:58:56,wallstreetbets,Do you have cash to cover potential losses if you’re doing this on margin?
2021-05-23 11:54:22,wallstreetbets,I wish you the bad kind of luck

Where generally their investments will go down with it?   You should have like a 1,000+ downvotes if people knew what you were asking for."
2021-05-23 11:52:48,wallstreetbets,Did your broker send you a gift card to your favorite local brunch spot and one of those rainbow pride shirts they sell at Target after you bought those puts?

2021-05-23 15:30:03,wallstreetbets,"Depending on what futures do, I think it will test 413 down before bouncing again (not advice)"

2021-05-23 16:08:51,wallstreetbets,I have complete faith in this position oddly
2021-05-23 16:09:25,wallstreetbets,Probably ok chances. Spy will definitely dip under 415 for at least a bit next week. Maybe enough to cover the decay. Just be ready to sell.
2021-05-23 16:10:11,wallstreetbets,"Good luck.. Your playing against a flat peak, but I hope I’m wrong!! Better off playing VXX calls. Don’t like seeing anyone in the heavy red 😢🦍"

2021-05-23 16:26:25,wallstreetbets,"If you're going to be structurally short, why wouldn't you bet against the high growth stuff instead? Won't another rise in rates or tapering of QE hurt growth the most?"
2021-05-23 16:33:56,wallstreetbets,Good Lord I read this as 360p at first
2021-05-23 16:37:44,wallstreetbets,You are going to print heavy Jesus
2021-05-23 16:38:25,wallstreetbets,415 strike on a put?  Yeah this will print Monday IMO.
2021-05-23 16:38:34,wallstreetbets,Easy money. Gap down tomorrow.
2021-05-23 16:41:36,wallstreetbets,"Why would you buy put option for spy and hold it over the weekend. 
Thats the dumbest thing to do"
2021-05-23 16:45:01,wallstreetbets,Remindme! 1 day

2021-05-23 17:00:20,wallstreetbets,This shit is gonna print
2021-05-23 17:03:29,wallstreetbets,It would have been cheaper to just buy the retail hedge stock aka GME

2021-05-23 17:20:07,wallstreetbets,If you double yer money the wife better let you have 2 girlfriends.
2021-05-23 17:25:46,wallstreetbets,Why spy and not spx? You can have the same position except less tax if you make money (I guess not relevant for this particular trade).
2021-05-23 17:29:09,wallstreetbets,Godspeed but damn
2021-05-23 17:30:44,wallstreetbets,"Spy 420 5/28 calls at open.

2021-05-23 17:56:44,wallstreetbets,Should've bought 420 calls
2021-05-23 18:00:55,wallstreetbets,Perfect timing my brother! Those will print mega money tomorrow. Market will be nose diving in the morning
2021-05-23 18:07:03,wallstreetbets,I bought 5/28 calls too. Strike price $417 and $418. I am not too confident to be honest

2021-05-23 12:01:30,wallstreetbets,What’s why you don’t buy puts
2021-05-23 12:25:39,wallstreetbets,You are going to be rich. The massive losses people are taking on the imaginary e-money will effect the market. 1.5%+ down monday.
2021-05-23 12:35:23,wallstreetbets,You don’t need it.
2021-05-23 13:47:57,wallstreetbets,Wow you lost 16% congrats 🙄
2021-05-23 17:17:30,wallstreetbets,A fool and his money soon parteth.... 😂😂🤷
2021-05-23 18:01:55,wallstreetbets,.... on margin 😑
2021-05-23 18:35:16,wallstreetbets,Man just give the money to charity next time at least you’ll get a tax credit. Good luck tho retard
2021-05-23 11:40:27,wallstreetbets,You don't.
2021-05-23 12:15:03,wallstreetbets,"It’s all about percentage of net worth. For a guy with 10 mil plus this is like 30k for a guy with a mil, 3k for a guy with 100k, etc. Amounts are relative to each of us."
2021-05-23 13:51:25,wallstreetbets,Weekends are priced in on options. It isn’t like nobody knows about the weekend.
2021-05-23 12:56:21,wallstreetbets,Cocaine and no sleep
2021-05-23 15:43:06,wallstreetbets,Lots of weed.
2021-05-23 15:44:03,wallstreetbets,Coffee and more stress 😹
2021-05-23 19:30:59,wallstreetbets,I am dreaming about me walking on the moon.
2021-05-23 15:01:27,wallstreetbets,Calculated risk vs potential reward!  Scary stuff!
2021-05-23 13:10:17,wallstreetbets,"In my opinion, the best comment in the thread."
2021-05-23 13:43:19,wallstreetbets,My free award expired so take this instead for the golden comment 🥇
2021-05-23 18:40:30,wallstreetbets,I think he's going to lose it all. Kind of deserves it with this dumbass YOLO play 🙄 more like a YOBO. (you're only bankrupt once)
2021-05-23 11:51:31,wallstreetbets,"Not a primate, gay bears are never as smart as apes, they have less wrinkles in their brain, fact actually, did you skip science?"
2021-05-23 15:40:40,wallstreetbets,What the fuck is he doing with this kind of money and weekly he does he not know what theta decay is. He should’ve extended the date to mid June fucking idiot
2021-05-23 14:23:24,wallstreetbets,Holy fuck same.
2021-05-23 12:28:01,wallstreetbets,Would have bought SPX puts if he was a billionaire; or even millionaire
2021-05-23 15:46:45,wallstreetbets,This is WSB are you new here?
2021-05-23 12:41:51,wallstreetbets,Probably cuz he doesn’t want to / broker won’t allow naked selling and owning the underlying on SPY for that high of a volume of contracts would be too much money. I always see this and think well if it were a spread it would be significantly less money than the YOLO. It wouldn’t be a YOLO at all because you need to sell cash covered or stock covered in most cases with brokers.
2021-05-23 17:27:41,wallstreetbets,If you want an early retirement. Yes. You can put your position on your tombstone.
2021-05-23 18:24:33,wallstreetbets,Ahh yes. motley fool is owned by who again?
2021-05-23 14:50:02,wallstreetbets,"Theta over the weekend isn’t as bad as everybody thinks. That being said this bet is actually retarded lmao,"

2021-05-23 13:54:29,wallstreetbets,"Another point worth noting is that you get taxed better on index options. If you somehow pull a gain, 60% of it is taxed at the long term rate."
2021-05-23 15:01:02,wallstreetbets,"and also doing it in a better broker, so you don't pay $1 per contract on vanguard."

2021-05-23 11:37:47,wallstreetbets,There's been so many people calling for corrections and then ATH's are made. Who knows? I think he should sell as soon if he gets any profit. He's saying it'll be below 412 on Friday. But that's a bit bet to say that he believes that $365K or $0 says it will be or not.
2021-05-23 15:33:37,wallstreetbets,If SPY repeats last week OP might get to make some serious money as long as he doesn’t get too greedy.
2021-05-23 11:54:12,wallstreetbets,"Bears and apes are not the same species, you and OP can keep losing for wishing the market to tank, good riddance."
2021-05-23 14:05:49,wallstreetbets,$1k in a margin account gives you $1k in option buying power. It doesn’t give you leverage like it would for stock buying. Makes sense since options themselves are a leveraged instrument.

2021-05-23 13:16:31,wallstreetbets,huh? This post is his only post.
2021-05-23 17:50:35,wallstreetbets,Yes
2021-05-23 13:43:37,wallstreetbets,By September SPY can go so far up that even a 5%-10% correction won’t reach current levels. I got burned twice with SPY puts dated a month out and prefer not to play these games anymore. VXX calls are cheaper and hold their value rather well a few weeks out.
2021-05-23 14:02:31,wallstreetbets,"Margin account. It doesn’t affect option buying power. $1k in a margin account is $1k in option buying power, but $2k in stock buying power."

2021-05-23 12:21:12,wallstreetbets,Yes but if you're that rich you usually want to preserve your money with safe assets not throw it into the dumpster fire and expect profits.
2021-05-23 15:58:12,wallstreetbets,"He shouldn’t be trading SPY if his net worth is > $1M. Instead he’d be trading SPX or ES for better contract lot sizes, cap gains tax benefits and liquidity. Clearly he’s close to max on his net worth in true wsb ape fashion."
2021-05-23 14:49:44,wallstreetbets,In that case it’s not Yolo

2021-05-23 19:00:05,wallstreetbets,"Exactly why ""yolos"" shouldn't be dictated by how much money it is rather than percentage of a portfolios value. There is no way this is more than 10% of theirs. You can't possibly be both stupid enough to make a legit Yolo like this while also being capable of accumulating 300k."
2021-05-23 19:29:10,wallstreetbets,Truth is here.

2021-05-23 15:55:13,wallstreetbets,ESM21 puts for the billionaires for the tax benefits and after hours liquidity. SPY traders are amateurs
2021-05-23 12:44:49,wallstreetbets,I don't even want to correct you
2021-05-23 15:55:46,wallstreetbets,"There's no theta burn over weekends, contrary to retarded beliefs here. MMs adjust the IV in the morning on mondays to account for the theta burns of the weekends so that in theory there is no contract devaluing from theta."
2021-05-23 14:29:57,wallstreetbets,"Exactly. If you’re going to pop 300k on options, definitely pull the trigger on SPX specifically for the vastly superior tax treatment."
2021-05-23 17:34:25,wallstreetbets,"There is backwardation on e-minis (so future is discounted to present)

https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/future/sp%20500%20futures

However this is driven by dividend yield (which is more than discount rate). The arbitrage trade here is to hold spx equivalent stock mix and sell futures (while collecting dividend). Compared to options there is little risk since futures are always exercised (while with option if spx goes down then it might not be exercised).

Options have decay because the holder of the contract has an *option* for the transaction to happen (so it is one sided, if contract benefits the holder it gets executed while if it doesn’t benefit it doesn’t get exercised). Futures are always exercised, the holder of the future doesn’t have optionality."
2021-05-23 14:28:35,wallstreetbets,"I think you may be getting futures and futures *options contracts* confused. There is no time decay when trading futures, but there are the usual Greeks when trading options on underlying futures."
2021-05-23 11:53:04,wallstreetbets,"Yes those are smart, not broad puts like OP."
2021-05-23 12:26:08,wallstreetbets,"what the reason for PTON puts, seems to have bottomed out already?"

2021-05-23 12:00:41,wallstreetbets,"Probably did it cause 420 meme resistance is real, been bouncing at this range for like two weeks. I would still think we need to correct to at least 400 to get a proper bounce. OPs betting on that too I guess, hope it happens sooner than later for his sake"
2021-05-23 11:58:23,wallstreetbets,Supposedly a big melt up to happen first
2021-05-23 13:51:05,wallstreetbets,And you think its going to keep rising despite the very real threat of interest rate change?

2021-05-23 14:45:27,wallstreetbets,"I've been mainly going with QQQ puts and SQQQ calls, since tech is so inflated and volatile.

2021-05-23 13:48:45,wallstreetbets,"PTON is not a $100 stock, it belongs below $80.  Seriously overvalued fundamentally.  Technical resistance at $100, support at $80"
2021-05-23 19:40:35,wallstreetbets,"agree.  I just looked at the chart and I think it will see $112 before 80.  Definitely overvalued, though and will head south soon enough."
2021-05-23 12:00:28,wallstreetbets,were have you been the last few months?
2021-05-23 17:25:43,wallstreetbets,That'd be great. I need some cheap spy puts.
2021-05-23 13:58:19,wallstreetbets,"Not necessarily rise much more, but I think it could trade relatively sideways until the realization inflation isn't as bad as the fear mongers say and interest rate changes DON'T matter much as long as they are expected and slowly rolled out. 

And many growth stocks are down 30-70% OR MORE from highs in February, a shift from the reopening stocks back to them is just a rebalancing without taking SPY crazy amounts higher. 

Tell me who's buying bonds at 2 or even 3% compared to investing in the actual market? Especially when the same people spreading fear about that are saying inflation will be 3%+. Your bonds will LOSE money. 

Equities will always be the best opportunity to earn a return and BEAT inflation. 

But that being said look at the big bank targets for the S&P, there is some upside as well, but I'm fine with sideways too."
2021-05-23 12:49:33,wallstreetbets,Puts on this guys spell check

2021-05-23 17:33:24,wallstreetbets,Casinos have been open.

2021-05-23 16:18:04,wallstreetbets,"Im all for YOLO's but this particular trade is, in my opinion, a dumpster fire. I may be wrong sure. 
Anyways why in the world would you, as a person with a networth of 10mio dollars, not invest in boomer stonks? You get your 6% p.a. and are set for live (more than your life. Your grandchildren might be set too). So what's the point in yoloing your money further? Don't be greedy. You will lose in the long run. This is a zero sum game. I mean do your thing but I just don't get it."
2021-05-23 15:48:13,wallstreetbets,"YOLO means he went all in, and he's even using margin."

2021-05-23 15:48:33,wallstreetbets,"Yea the whole notion ""if I was rich I wouldn't be such a retard"" is fucking rich with irony.

While it will take a bit longer, anyone disciplined can get rich if they're willing to be patient and do so fairly safely.  99% of people upvoting the dumpster fire comment is doing exactly that, probably throwing away most of their money in dumpster fires lmao."
2021-05-23 16:30:34,wallstreetbets,"I am well aware of WSB etiquette. I mean yolo your six figure salary if you want to, it's your money. The upside may be retirement in a few years maybe a few trades. But where is the real upside when you are already set? Live your life man."
2021-05-23 15:32:58,wallstreetbets,Because someone with 10m isn’t making those kind of bets
2021-05-23 17:39:15,wallstreetbets,"I would think the YOLO implies he’s not rich. If it was a Rich person YOLOing, it’s just a hedge and they’re just milking karma af that point."
2021-05-23 16:07:25,wallstreetbets,He said YOLO. Which is a statement of an “all in” move. If he had 10m it would be a 10m bet.

2021-05-23 12:50:46,wallstreetbets,">It wouldn’t be a YOLO at all because you need to sell cash covered or stock covered in most cases with brokers.

The short put in this case would be covered by his long put. 

He buys 415 P

He can sell 400 P without it being cash covered as 400P will be covered by 415P"
2021-05-23 12:44:16,wallstreetbets,"If you're a poker player, this is called being ""on tilt"". It means you've lost money and now you're making irrationally risky and/or large bets in a bid to get it all back. It often results in losses a lot bigger than the initial one that set you over the edge. If your initial problem was putting too much at risk, going on tilt makes the situation worse, not better. We've all been there. Put your wallet away and take a break."

Meme stocks aren't FAKE companies first of all. But yes many 'meme' stocks are among the ones I mentioned.

At least that's my experience from the couple of different people I know who have a net worth of over $100 million each.  $360k to them is a new car, so it isn't exactly painless to lose even at that level, but if they win they get the rush that they feel the need to experience.   I find it's more common with people who were born into wealth, probably has something to do with their mental development of being raised in an environment where you always have your needs and wants met."

2021-05-23 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"I built a program that tracks mentions and sentiment of stocks across Reddit and Twitter! This week's most discussed and top growing stocks! This post is in continuation of a series of posts I made in the previous weeks. You can find the last week's post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nds2vh/i_built_a_program_that_tracks_mentions_and/). The response I received was amazing and a lot of you were asking for continued weekly updates. So here goes!

**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**

https://preview.redd.it/rc961bm4hv071.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=4701a99fd4471a560552f895ebcc817e72e334d3

GME continues to retain its number 1 position as the most discussed stocks. AMC has made huge strides in conversation volume over the past two weeks going from 7th position to 2nd position. Investor sentiment in Tesla is muted given the continuous drop the stock has faced over the last month and its controversial decision of dropping \[Redacted\] as a payment option.

Newcomers to the top 10 list are Lordstown Motors and Ford. Ford was trending due to the unveiling of their new electric truck, F-150 Lightning whereas RIDE seems to be making a comeback after the drastic decline due to the short-seller report (the stock had dropped from $30 to $7 within 3 months)

**Top Growing Stocks of the Week**

https://preview.redd.it/k4xmo4x0hv071.png?width=1106&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce0062bb7d45593b31f4660f4e328b1265bebf56

Above is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media. We definitely have some interesting stocks on the list.

**Western Digital($WDC) and Seagate Technology($STX)** were both trending due to reports of skyrocketing demands for high-capacity drives used to create \[redacted\], a new \[redacted\] started by Bram Cohen. While the full-scale impact of this is still not visible, investors are expecting an increase in demand for storage devices. The obvious downside to this play is that the newly issued currency can be overpriced and can completely die out making this sudden increase in demand just a momentary spike.

**Fisker($FSR)** has made numerous headlines in recent days. The stock is up almost 20% in the last week. Fisker’s Ocean electric SUV is attractively priced at $30K making it an electric SUV for the masses (though it’s slated for production in late 2022). The company has generated more than 11,000 pre-orders for its product and is also set to make the first all-electric papal transport for the Pope.

**Ford($F)** was trending as the company introduced their new electric F-150 Lightning pickup. Ford’s CEO Jim Farley has said that the truck would be a test as to whether mainstream Americans truly want electric vehicles. The Truck has got more than 44K reservations in less than 48 hours which pushed the stock price even further. One major aspect driving the interest is price, with the base model costing just $40K before any federal tax credits.

SOME FAQ’s:

How does the program work: The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about in the stock is positive or negative).

What is sentiment: It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively.  The numbers you are seeing here are the average across all the comments.

Thank you for reading!

Shit, a bunch of us in here *are* shorting some company or another. Especially with recent trends.

But either way, WSB is definitely about risky option plays. Sometimes an opportunity presents itself to make some money another way (ex: GME) and a lot of people hopped in to make some easy money at the expense of a couple of hedge funds. The guys who came in trying to turn the sub into ""WSB vs. [XYZ]"" were mostly outsiders looking to co-opt the place for their own cause (a lot of occupy wall street-types showed up in January, for example).

Edit:  Cramer also. When he get stupid excited over something it is time to run or wait.  Ex. He was crazy for CHWY when it was going through the IPO. Stock tanked.  He was anti Tesla until on day when his wife changed his mind.   Pretty much coincided with Tesla top."

2021-05-23 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$HIMX DD , Value AND Growth in Tech sector??  Himax Technologies is a semicoductor manufacturer based in Taiwan. They supply semiconductor and display drivers to laptops, smartphones, tv's and cars. They also develop their own technology, such as a proprietary 3D Sensor technology for facial recognition used in security applications, and their WiseEye technology for motion detection in AI applications.

[https://www.himax.com.tw/](https://www.himax.com.tw/)

THE BASICS

$HIMX is one of the few stocks in the tech / semiconductor sector that offers Value & Growth, with a potential near term window for a short squeeze.

$HIMX is currently trading at $10.36 / share 

They crushed their last earnings report with an EPS of $.38 , outperforming their guidance of $.30 - $.34 . Their gross margin was 40%, also outperforming their 38% guidance.

[https://www.himax.com.tw/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/HIMAX\_1Q21\_Earnings\_PR\_Final.pdf](https://www.himax.com.tw/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/HIMAX_1Q21_Earnings_PR_Final.pdf)

Additionally, their Q2 guidance is very positive. The are estimating at EPS of between $.54 and $.60 , and an even better gross margin of 45% - 47%

INSANLELY UNDERVALUED at $10.36 / share

If you can find a better value in the tech/semiconductor sector, let me know. But these numbers are getting to be a little insane.

The stock saw a pop up to $15/share after a pre-earnings announcement in April. But since then it's been the target of a short campaign, and been forced down by general market feelings toward the tech sector, as well as inflation fears. But look at these numbers:

Trailing P/E is 16.09

Forward P/E is 5.41

Market Cap is  $1.8 Billion

Trailing revenue is $1 billion 

Cash heavy with d $245.8 million in cash in Q1, and only $57 million in loan debt

This company has a healthy balance sheet, plenty of cash, and it's yearly revenue 55% of it's market cap. 

[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/HIMX/key-statistics/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/HIMX/key-statistics/)

Here's the thing. Institutional ownership is relatively low, which makes this stock an easy target for manipulation. As of this quarter, institutions own 19.25% of the company, but that's up from 12% from the previous quarter, with about $60 positive inflows from filings this quarter. These were all trades made in Q1 that were reported this quarter.

[https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/HIMX/institutional-ownership/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/HIMX/institutional-ownership/)

&#x200B;

But since their last earnings release earlier this month, the price has tanked. There's been insane Put volume, and it seems someone with a lot of buying power is manipulating this stock downward, perhaps in an attempt to exercise puts.

June 18th is particularly interesting. Take a look at Put open interest for June 18th. 41,664 OI on a $9/put.

[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/HIMX/options?date=1623974400](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/HIMX/options?date=1623974400)

https://preview.redd.it/mxx4xqs42v071.png?width=1422&format=png&auto=webp&s=48f4220faab9b268ee6e64913bad3a81ea084bbf

There was similar Put interest this past week at the $10.50 strike price . . . and low and behold, the stock closed at $10.36 on this past Friday.

I'm no options expert, but I think it's clear we have some manipulation, perhaps with the intent to for MM's or hedges to drive price down and exercise cheap puts to pick this stock up even cheaper.

But how far can the stock get driven down?

There's a few things to take into consideration on the downside.

1. Taiwan Drought - Drought in Taiwan has effected chip industry. So far it hasn't effected Himax though, and the claim to have secured supply chain growth for the remaining of the year.
2. Taiwan Covid - There's been an outbreak of Covid cases. This could disrupt production, but  Taiwan seems to be working quick to curtail the issue. This is definitely an unknown at this point.
3. Past Fraud Allegations: in 2017 Citron Research accused Himax of providing false information on forward guidance statments. No official charges were levied though. [https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2017/12/08/1250159/0/en/Himax-Technologies-Strongly-Denies-Citron-Research-Allegations-of-Fraud.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2017/12/08/1250159/0/en/Himax-Technologies-Strongly-Denies-Citron-Research-Allegations-of-Fraud.html)
4. Bollinger bands analysis suggest further downside to single digits before a rebound. THis is without future catalyst, or renewed interest in the stock [https://stockinvest.us/stock/HIMX](https://stockinvest.us/stock/HIMX)

&#x200B;

Now, some recent Catalysts to the upside. 

1. A new product line of Phase Modulation platforms was released last week that could disrupt automotive/EV display technology  . "" Himax’s phase modulation LCoS enables multi-focal holographic displays in automotive AR HUD and will disrupt the common standard of HUD today"" [https://www.himax.com.tw/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Himax-phase-modulation-LCoS\_Final.pdf](https://www.himax.com.tw/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Himax-phase-modulation-LCoS_Final.pdf)
2. Their WiseEye technology, another digitial display tech, is coming online for sales in Q4, with Tier 1 costumers already lined up "" WiseEye product line which the Company believes will be a major growth engine for its business for many years.  "" [https://www.himax.com.tw/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/HIMAX\_1Q21\_Earnings\_PR\_Final.pdf](https://www.himax.com.tw/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/HIMAX_1Q21_Earnings_PR_Final.pdf)
3. DIVIDEND ANOUNCEMENT: Himax suspended dividends last year because of Covid, but many speculate a dividend is coming soon. Taiwan companies are incentivized to pay out dividends though very large tax breaks. A dividend announcement would surely bring in further institutional investors. 

So there you have it. This is NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE. Just a heads up that HIMX seems to have some short term short interest, but could be ready to kick off. I'll let you decide."

2021-05-23 14:02:09,wallstreetbets,Can someone explain why there is a potential squeeze in AMC. I recall when the first round of GME happened AMC shot Up as well. But why is there talk about a $100k shot up I know moon Boys are retarded. I am just a dumb ape needing some information on to why I have been holding this stock for 5 months.
2021-05-23 12:31:54,wallstreetbets,"The only thing good to come out of the pandemic is the light it shined on companies like amc that are behind the times. 

When normal people want to watch a movie they load up on all those snacks and goodies at the dollar store and go back to the crib with their friends and family and fire up their 65” tv that more than likely has one of the many streaming apps and enjoy the movie in the comfort of their own home. 

The only way this stock starts trending upward is if whales get involved or some HUGE catalyst."

2021-05-23 11:56:27,wallstreetbets,"In my opinion cinemas will survive IF they continue to expand and grow services and offerings more unique than the usual popcorn coke nachos pizza type cinema. Went to a brand new CMX cinema prior to pandemic and was highly impressed, beyond any AMC I had ever been to. AMC has some major work and innovating to do to really grow. and i’m a cinema lover and wish they would and hurry up! That said i have no issues with trading their stock for short term profits."
2021-05-23 10:58:17,wallstreetbets,During the pandemic people have bought the new streaming services. Why go to the movie theater ? Just my opinion.
2021-05-23 13:43:46,wallstreetbets,$500 refillable barrels of popcorn and casks of Coke are the future for the movie industry.
2021-05-23 14:11:32,wallstreetbets,"I'm super dumb but it seems there's a lot of shorting going on with HFs and a large amount of AMC is publicly owned, meaning if enough retail holders continue to hold the price can rise without restriction. Definitely not a guarantee but in my personal and probably wrong opinion I think it's likely to rise some amount at least."
2021-05-23 15:19:23,wallstreetbets,"It's simple: People who can't afford GME shares want it to happen with AMC, even though it clearly already did happen"
2021-05-23 12:44:33,wallstreetbets,To be honest... I just like the stock
2021-05-23 16:20:18,wallstreetbets,"They will probably have to reinvent themselves like gme, focus more on producing series like the walking dead"
2021-05-23 18:58:22,wallstreetbets,I like the stock I buy and hold
2021-05-23 13:39:59,wallstreetbets,People still need a neutral place for first dates. Just ask your wife's boyfriends.
2021-05-23 11:10:58,wallstreetbets,"I hear you and see why that makes sense, but for me personally the big screen and great sound of a theater, the «ritual» so to speak of buying tickets and commiting to a movie makes it more special, and is something I think is important to a lot of film enthusiasts and social people who wants to do activities like this together.

There is room for both streaming and movie theaters (and blu-rays but that might just be me lol), and I’m sure it will balance out once the post-pandemic dust settles."
2021-05-23 11:10:16,wallstreetbets,"Why go to a bar when you can drink from home, why watch a game or fight at a sports bar when you can do the same at home? Why walk at the park when you can walk at home around the house or in the house? Why drive in the mountains when you can drive to the end of the street? Why watch a movie when you can read a book or why read the book if you can watch a movie? Do all these questions need an answer? ................................answer: the atmosphere; a change of scenery. Not everyone is a hermit"
2021-05-23 15:15:48,wallstreetbets,Ohh OK I heard a bit about that but does it have the potential to do a gme squeeze?.
2021-05-23 17:04:16,wallstreetbets,That was forplay
2021-05-23 19:00:42,wallstreetbets,This right here is all the dd you need on AMC it’s literally that simple

2021-05-23 11:16:28,wallstreetbets,"Yeah see you're investing emotionally...

Statistics literally shit all over your sentiment and idea of what is ""more special""."
2021-05-23 11:15:46,wallstreetbets,"...

You moron. You fucking clueless moron. In what world is going to a place to sit in silence for 2 hours more social than hosting a movie night?

Get with the times, boomer. There's a reason there has been a HUGE demographic decline in cinemas."
2021-05-23 16:53:49,wallstreetbets,"I couldn't tell you, I'm still pretty new with the stock market myself. I think it does have the potential to go up quite a bit in value under the right conditions but I couldn't say how likely those conditions are. in my personal opinion I think the stock is destined to go up some and value at least as regulations lesson and people start going back to the theater, but it's important to note that everything is just speculation and any number of things could influence the outcome that we don't know of. it really is anyone's guess."
2021-05-23 17:03:54,wallstreetbets,It is bigger. You have not see anything yet
2021-05-23 18:59:48,wallstreetbets,"Studios have ended their contracts with streaming services

2021-05-23 18:53:19,wallstreetbets,"Cinemas are here to stay they will never die 

Pre pandemic they were the 2nd most popular activity besides going out to eat"
2021-05-23 11:37:21,wallstreetbets,"No. Statistics say that new films are not as near as profitable in streaming as they are in the theaters. That got catched in the pandemic stream premieres that were a total failure. 
Also Hollywood want theaters to release their movies then sell them to streaming services.
So no, streaming is a good thing, but theaters are a different animal."
2021-05-23 11:36:56,wallstreetbets,"There's no doubt amc is overvalued by a factor of 4/5, but cinemas are here to stay and I have no idea what statistics you're talking about outside of the pandemic that would suggest they're going to die"
2021-05-23 11:34:06,wallstreetbets,People predicted movie theaters’ demise when netflix first came around and it didn’t go anywhere then. Don’t think they will now either. There’s room for both.
2021-05-23 12:14:52,wallstreetbets,Youre not sitting in silence youre watching a movie.
2021-05-23 11:36:16,wallstreetbets,Nope your the f!@&$! Moron because you act like history doesn’t repeat itself.  it repeats itself because people never change. Times change and things change. People are the same. Always have been. Like you; there has always been people closed minded while claiming that there needs to be diversity just like you and will always be. You think every one likes to entertain guests as apposed to a dark theater alone or with a friend. Get out of your bubble and look around. Drive to a different state or two. Listen to different music and have some conversations with others than your own social group. Yea there will always be people that want to leave their home and get out into a different setting period.
2021-05-23 11:21:37,wallstreetbets,If I go to the theater I could end up meeting jerks like you. Why resort to name calling because of an opinion?
2021-05-23 13:59:05,wallstreetbets,"u/admiral_asswank , I just wanted to know I've seen you try to help people realize they are making a bad investment. I do the same. I've seen you try reasoning, logic, stats, debating and occationally getting angry. But there is just no talking to some of these people. They want to believe in the dream and are too emotionally invested. Just want you to know that I appreciate your effort. You're good people."
2021-05-23 13:10:27,wallstreetbets,"I never said streaming once.

You should really look into the health of cinemas in the USA."
2021-05-23 13:11:38,wallstreetbets,"It isn't my job to do YOUR dd for you.

Especially something as fucking fundamental as ""are people as interested in cinema today as they were 10/20/30/40 years ago?""

""What can cinemas do to keep people coming AND get new people coming too?"""

There's a reason fewer people go to the movies, DESPITE box office growing.

Wake up you idiots"

 Get better at passing the Turing test."
2021-05-23 13:49:29,wallstreetbets,"I know there is less customers than 10 years before, but it isn't a dead business, or a dead entertainment. People want to go to the cinemas. I think now even with streaming hitting the industry, they have different approaches.
Just as having dinner in your home or in a restaurant."
2021-05-23 18:54:36,wallstreetbets,There’s a reason a lot of studios are canceling their contracts with streaming services in favor of an theater release sorry movies aren’t going anywhere

2021-05-23 13:19:58,wallstreetbets,"That’s good for you. I don’t need to wake up to know id rather go to a movie theater than go to someone’s house to watch something on a smaller screen, with worse sound, where people will pause or talk over it while it’s playing, get up and walk around, leave the lights on,etc..

Not every movie needs to be seen in a theater but there are still plenty of them every year that id much rather see in a place that has relatively less distractions and a better set up. A lot of theaters have pretty comfortable lounge chairs now too anyways. I go to event movies for the collective experience of everyone finally getting to see something they’re excited about, and that’s not something ive ever found to be replaceable by one’s home theater set up."
2021-05-23 13:29:33,wallstreetbets,Have you read your own post history?  You sound really angry and delusional.  It's hard to believe you're conscious.
2021-05-23 13:33:42,wallstreetbets,What?
2021-05-23 18:27:50,wallstreetbets,"I never said dead.

I said *dying*. All diluting the shares did was *delay that death*.

If the company proposes some **major changes** to attract new revenue, then I will eat sand.

But they managed to fucking raise somewhere between 4 and 6 BILLION and **still have debt**.

Like Jesus H christ."
2021-05-23 15:15:39,wallstreetbets,Lol you cherry picked numbers that make it look like ticket sales weren't declining and even then they don't look very good

2021-05-23 19:39:33,wallstreetbets,Lmao and you can keep going on about the semantics over this and i still wont care because i was only answering the question of why would anyone want to go to the movies. Keep fighting the good fight there ben shapiro. Nobody in this conversation thread cares about your facts. Learn how to have a conversation with someone that doesnt revolve around your obsessive attention to details no one was asking about.

2021-05-23 09:38:02,wallstreetbets,Man SPCE is like the most volatile long term position I hold; it’s also one of my favorite positions to track and watch because space flight fascinates me and I really want them to succeed as a company. It’s been super fun to watch it over the last year.

2021-05-23 09:58:04,wallstreetbets,First stop 25.50 next stop 27.50 last stop 28.50
2021-05-23 10:46:15,wallstreetbets,"I may get downvoted for this, but what is the long-term bull case for SPCE? 

The essence of it seems to be sales of a three-day experience that culminates in about 6 minutes of subspace flight ans weightlessness. The pricetag for which will supposedly be about $200k. That means your customer base is limited to the top 1%, who want to do it and can also pass a required physical. 

Any bull case also has to include a basically perfect safety record, once SPCE in the operational phase. A Concord-like accident would cause the stock price to half overnight, and likely dry up the reservation books. 

I'm not trying to be pessimistic. I'm a person who is very interested in space and spaceflight. And I think short-term calls are likely to print. I just don't don't see this particular business model working out medium- to long-term."

2021-05-23 11:06:01,wallstreetbets,"SPCE is a cool concept stock.

The only question I have is if people will pay big bucks for a glorified jet plane ride to see the stars and the curve of the earth and all that?

Bezos is going after the whole ""5-4-3-2-1 Blast Off!"" experience with the high g-forces and everything that goes with it. I think that is where the real money will go, but VirginGalactic should find its niche."
2021-05-23 17:32:25,wallstreetbets,FYI - I wouldn’t advise holding it long. Sell on the spike on Monday. I expect a big sell dump from the previous bag holders after.
2021-05-23 11:03:34,wallstreetbets,Why are people congrats? These expire Friday and not even at strike. Monday they will be worth less than Friday 🤣 good luck buddy don't premature celebrate

2021-05-23 15:33:22,wallstreetbets,It has to be above 25.78 on Friday before you make any money.   Trading at 21.07 now.   What am I missing besides a space launch that was expected not to crash?

2021-05-23 13:34:56,wallstreetbets,the longer you hold options close to expiration date the less valuable they become
2021-05-23 13:37:02,wallstreetbets,Nice. I went short on this sometime last week for an intra-day trade.  Given the commercial news with their success I think it’s going to be a great long play over the next year
2021-05-23 13:53:04,wallstreetbets,I did the same Friday
2021-05-23 13:58:12,wallstreetbets,Congrats！I've the same contact. Be ready to roll or close Monday morning

2021-05-23 08:37:38,wallstreetbets,but this company (SPCE) has never even been to space.
2021-05-23 09:28:58,wallstreetbets,can I get an explanation how does call works?
2021-05-23 19:38:10,wallstreetbets,Virgin space is dead. It's a worthless stock. Careful.
2021-05-23 15:31:41,wallstreetbets,"Am I missing something here? At $25 strike these calls are still far from in the money.  Even though the launch was successful, there’s no guarantee that the stock takes off tomorrow.  I could even see a world where SPCE has a sell off before market open.  I’ve got calls and puts at $20 myself, but this does seem like premature celebration"
2021-05-23 09:46:58,wallstreetbets,I'm just hoping to regain my losses
2021-05-23 10:28:03,wallstreetbets,Can someone eli5 why these increased in value? They are at the 25 strike so have no intrinsic value since the stock is below that. So is IV driving option price higher?

2021-05-23 11:34:59,wallstreetbets,I'm going to buy some spce soon pretty much for the same reason
2021-05-23 12:04:14,wallstreetbets,"Same, it's sorta been a childhood dream of mine to one day ride a rocket in space.  Who knows, if this lottery ticket pays off maybe they really send apes into the moon LMAO."
2021-05-23 16:09:00,wallstreetbets,"Its unfortunate that Virgin Galactic's entire consumer base is about to be chewed up and spit out by Blue Origin's New Shepherd program.

They beat them to the punch for their first confirmed operational flight date, and I'm willing to bet a rocket is going to attract more customers than an air-launch spaceplane. Having the launch tower, capsule, larger interior volume, and parachuted landing is likely going to be an experience many more rich people are interested in over the former. You'd certainly ""feel"" a lot more like an astronaut.

I still own some SPCE and hope for their success, but it's unfortunate this test took so long to complete. The boat hasn't sailed per se, but it definitely could have been a lot bigger."
2021-05-23 17:30:20,wallstreetbets,"If you’re truly interested in space stocks, look at the company acquiring Rocket Lab, VACQ. SPCE doesn’t have the best market position. They’ve spent >$1billion on developing their rocket that won’t go into orbit (only short, sub-orbital flights). Rocket Lab is already flying rockets with decent success and is working up to a larger, falcon 9 sized rocket."

2021-05-23 11:29:47,wallstreetbets,"Who says they have to stop at thrill seeker experiences? Space will be commercialized beyond LEO. 

The model could be similar to Musk. Sell the experience to the rich to fund something else. For Musk it was cars to wider audience at cheaper prices. For Virgin it could be other LEO, GEO, or farther activities that may or may not be customer and experience related. 

But other than that I have no clue. And that bull case would require more than what Virgin has revealed publicly and billions more investment and probably another decade (but with Virgins pace, probably 3 decades)🤣🤣🤣🤣

I also don’t see how Virgin could lower prices to widen the audience over time unless they piggyback other government, commercial or general science related experiments. But for that to be useful they would need to extend their orbit time. It just seems like a short term hype train to capture investment money from space enthusiasts…wouldn’t be surprised to see dilution to help fund their business in the future. 

Yeah…I don’t see a bull case long term unless you think everyone will spend their life’s earnings on this in their retirement. YOLO."
2021-05-23 10:41:11,wallstreetbets,"He bought 400 calls and paid $0.78 * 100 = $78 for each call. Basically he spent 78 * 400 = $31,200 in total. Each call option allows him to buy 100 shares of SPCE at $25 by May 28 (assuming SPCE's market value is above $25 by May 28th, or else they become worthless).

In other words, he will have the option to buy 40,000 shares of SPCE at $25 by May 28th."
2021-05-23 10:26:01,wallstreetbets,Option to buy 40000 shares
2021-05-23 10:30:18,wallstreetbets,Paid $.78 per share for the option to buy up to 40000 shares for $25 each by Friday. Currently worth $.98 per share.

2021-05-23 09:34:13,wallstreetbets,No. Dont gamble with your savings for school. Become a doctor first.
2021-05-23 10:37:22,wallstreetbets,"As someone who has been through med school from a non-affluent background, don't worry about it.  Any money you make will be taken away from you by your medical school.  Put as much in retirement now, they don't look at those accounts but have access to all others.  Rich kids have parents to pay, dirt poor and students with ethnic last names get scholarship.  If you are upper-lower class or middle class you get fucked.  The less money you have the more you will get in grants/scholarship (usually in your 3rd and 4th years) as schools try to lower their average indebtedness.  You aren't going to make 400k to pay for med school with this, so it doesn't matter.

Edit: Just realized you are probably still in college. Most important is saving enough money to afford MCAT, applications, and interview traveling, which is multiple thousands of dollars and a low chance of even getting accepted.  Try to finish undergrad with as little debt as possible since interest will build for years as you can't make any money in med school."
2021-05-23 09:24:41,wallstreetbets,"It might go up bigly. But no, it isn't wise. SPCE is a company that does not yet sell a product. And many things can still go wrong before they start making money."

2021-05-23 15:38:27,wallstreetbets,I cannot think of a worse idea.  Look at SPCE’s 3 month chart if you wanna see how easily this stock has dropped.  In general don’t invest your savings in anything you see show up on the front page of this sub if you’re 18 and trying to go to med school
2021-05-23 09:22:19,wallstreetbets,Lol this sub has basically become CNBC.  Downvoted for mentioning GME.  Unreal.

2021-05-23 13:34:30,wallstreetbets,Kratos is a great space play. They are so well entrenched in the US military that they get contacted by any company looking to get into the bidding process for any military contracts. They were also led by the hand to design the Valkyrie drone to the exact specifications they wanted and Kratos delivered big time! Most likely one of the big companies will want to buy it but I don’t think the Military wants that to happen as they have created a very intense bidding process as they all want in on the new frontier!

2021-05-23 15:58:15,wallstreetbets,"I really do think the company is well positioned to have the cheapest flights to space. Eventually, and I'm talking years someone who is merely well off could afford a flight."
2021-05-23 09:24:41,wallstreetbets,"You have a pretty large position. Sell off in chunks (10%) as things move. Lock in some profits early. If your bet hits, you'll still have some at max profit, if it's the right direction but not far enough you'll still hit profits overall and if it goes against you you won't get fully rekt. 

That was a big balls play, but don't let that big brass sack you have get in the way of reeling in some gains"
2021-05-23 10:08:36,wallstreetbets,"Dang you got 400 of them bitches lol I’d sell like 10-20 just to get a bit back and hold the rest till either moon or they start to dip some. But I’m also an idiot and you’re clearly smarter than me. Congrats!   

I went cheap mode and got a few $35, $40, $45, and $50 calls all expiring Friday lol. Hopefully those get me some profit but it’ll obviously be nothing compared to those $20 and $25 calls."
2021-05-23 08:45:48,wallstreetbets,You correctly bought the rumor....
2021-05-23 17:06:06,wallstreetbets,We don’t sell w fly again
2021-05-23 10:09:03,wallstreetbets,What did Elon tweet? How high are you thinking it might go?
2021-05-23 15:53:59,wallstreetbets,"I’m having the same dilemma! I only own 50 calls but with a July expiration. I was first thinking to sell everything Monday morning. With all the hype and some time left before expiration, I am thinking to sell about half on the spike and keep the rest and see where it goes."
2021-05-23 13:39:02,wallstreetbets,Just Did Sat the one last year failed to release from White Knight.  This will give them a huge boost and get them going for Space Tourism later this year.
2021-05-23 17:09:33,wallstreetbets,"SPCE normal IV is around 90-120. Most people use around 110 as the base to calculate. You are right, it needs to be above $24 but I don’t see an issue for it to get there."
2021-05-23 09:45:07,wallstreetbets,For now I've got 81 shares avg cost of 24. Really regret I didn't buy more
2021-05-23 19:12:23,wallstreetbets,Ok thanks guys I’ll just wait and hold off for now
2021-05-23 15:43:51,wallstreetbets,"There is 0% chance the price goes up 50% tomorrow.  OP do your due diligence on this stock and don’t base it off of how many shares and at what price a stranger bought it on the internet.  Two of the founders of the company sold off a significant stake within the last month, and the company has done nothing but bleed since then."
2021-05-23 10:57:51,wallstreetbets,"So his $31,200 will turn into $1,000,000?"
2021-05-23 14:29:46,wallstreetbets,"wow! i see why everybody is congratulating him, he will be millonare!"
2021-05-23 16:02:09,wallstreetbets,"I agree! This isn’t a sell the news situation. Of course you never know how the markets I’ll really react. I think there are a lot of moneys on the sidelines wanting to jump back in, shorts need to cover, and the general hype of the stock will send it up on Monday!"
2021-05-23 09:27:20,wallstreetbets,I’m mad I didn’t gamble on the lakers last week. The odds of them winning the championship went from +425 to -300.
2021-05-23 09:42:09,wallstreetbets,"Then, and only then, gamble with your savings"
2021-05-23 12:31:47,wallstreetbets,"Yeah cuz everyone is tired of hearing gme and amc in every thread, even about stocks that have nothing to do w gme and its brought up. Go to the gme board w that"
2021-05-23 09:24:31,wallstreetbets,I thought about it after I posted it but embrace the good with the bad.
2021-05-23 19:52:26,wallstreetbets,he has only 5 trading days left for it to get to $25.78.   The closer to Friday the less premium it will have.   If it goes to $25 on Friday at the close it will be worth nothing.
2021-05-23 09:29:14,wallstreetbets,"Upper atmosphere. Space boundary is at 100km, this test went to 89km"
2021-05-23 09:42:36,wallstreetbets,"wait so ....if it doesn't? then do u pay more or u just lose whatever u had at the moment.

I bought 20 shares of space stonks.

shud I have just gone for options?"

2021-05-23 10:10:14,wallstreetbets,"Spce is a squeeze machine, frankly, you'd think shorts would've learned to stay away from it by now"
2021-05-23 11:31:35,wallstreetbets,Same but with $ASTS. Wondering when people will catch onto that one
2021-05-23 17:47:46,wallstreetbets,LETS GETEMMMMMM!!!
2021-05-23 14:38:13,wallstreetbets,Is going to print.

2021-05-23 09:34:02,wallstreetbets,You see how volatile spce is? Yeah it’s cheap n easy
2021-05-23 12:06:19,wallstreetbets,Actually given that a test launch was around the corner... yes
2021-05-23 08:36:12,wallstreetbets,For me it was. :P
2021-05-23 09:47:59,wallstreetbets,The share price is currently at 21 and they just reached space yesterday during a test that’s meant to get FAA approval. I think 25 is fine
2021-05-23 09:48:39,wallstreetbets,U know nothing
2021-05-23 12:03:31,wallstreetbets,"said by someone NOT paying attention to current events.  Price took a beating the last couple weeks and even after last week's rally is still down for the month.

They announced a test flight Thursday and then completed it successfully on Saturday.

$30 on **MONDAY** is probably likely.

P.S. He doesn't need to hit $25 to make money, regardless."
2021-05-23 10:01:06,wallstreetbets,Agreed.  I would sell this while ahead.
2021-05-23 10:38:20,wallstreetbets,They're Twink adjacent
2021-05-23 10:40:22,wallstreetbets,People who think a stock or the whole market will go down in the near future. Bulls think it will go up.
2021-05-23 10:53:52,wallstreetbets,"Bears are the opposite of bulls.
You're a bull if you expect the stock/market to rise (bullish).
You're a bear if you expect the stock/market to fall (bearish).
You're a retard if you sell GME (retarded)."
2021-05-23 13:07:37,wallstreetbets,"Bears are people who unironically suck dicks. In like a really degrading and nasty fashion. Not in a loving homosexual relationship kinda way, but in a way that would make the average gay person sick. With a complete lack of self respect, they just want to get fucked up by numerous cocks. 

They also bet and root for the market to do poorly, and invest in a way as to profit from others suffering."
2021-05-23 12:13:19,wallstreetbets,Any tips on genetics companies to look into? I bought SPCE for a lifetime hold but looking to invest into another long term company in the next 3-6 months.
2021-05-23 12:05:23,wallstreetbets,"Bet on the future, win-win."
2021-05-23 12:13:55,wallstreetbets,This is why I bought in to TSP.
2021-05-23 13:24:46,wallstreetbets,Transformational wealth can and will be created in two of the most divergent industries! Being born healthy with no genetic disorders and then your parents taking you home to your new planet! Ka fuckin ching!
2021-05-23 14:30:23,wallstreetbets,Important in just the next decade? More like forever.
2021-05-23 10:44:15,wallstreetbets,What are options??
2021-05-23 11:23:32,wallstreetbets,Yes with today's knowledge . But they could have expired otm.
2021-05-23 13:56:44,wallstreetbets,"Ahh, I see, I thought you meant they had another one upcoming this week."
2021-05-23 14:31:04,wallstreetbets,that is fucking crazy!!!
2021-05-23 11:12:56,wallstreetbets,"No, if he wants to buy the 40,000 shares (exercise the call), he will need to spend $1,000,000. He does not get it. :)

However, the premium he spent on the calls, the $31,200, will increase in value the higher SPCE gets. If SPCE closes at $26 on May 28th, he will probably get a 5x gain on the $31,200 ( just an estimate). Not quite a million, but still a lot."
2021-05-23 11:06:05,wallstreetbets,No lol
2021-05-23 09:28:10,wallstreetbets,They ain't gonna win the championship so you saved yourself some money.
2021-05-23 12:55:04,wallstreetbets,.... a very small part of your savings. And invest the bigger part in lower risk stocks/funds.
2021-05-23 09:36:46,wallstreetbets,"As defined by NASA it starts at 80km. Regardless it's impressive, and the first of many steps to make space tourism a real thing. 

First to market, or near enough, counts for a lot more than being short 10km of more standard definitions of space."
2021-05-23 09:34:00,wallstreetbets,"Not according NASA and USAF. It’s 50 miles. 

“In the United States, professional, military, and commercial astronauts who travel above an altitude of 50 miles (80 km) are awarded astronaut wings”"
2021-05-23 09:43:58,wallstreetbets,Options can only go to zero.
2021-05-23 10:12:15,wallstreetbets,If it doesn't then you're only losing the price you paid for the contract.
2021-05-23 12:27:00,wallstreetbets,I mean yeah Branson is like a retarded evil Elon
2021-05-23 12:04:17,wallstreetbets,Nice! Would like to see Themis for $PLTR soon
2021-05-23 16:16:20,wallstreetbets,"$ASTS is supposed to make me think of ass to ass when I read it, right?"
2021-05-23 11:27:00,wallstreetbets,"Tendies > pussy
It's as easy as that"
2021-05-23 12:08:56,wallstreetbets,Underrated comment
2021-05-23 14:26:24,wallstreetbets,"SPCE went to actual space on saturday. 25 is very likely, maybe even back to 50"
2021-05-23 10:07:39,wallstreetbets,Why is he ahead since it hasn't even hit the strike price?
2021-05-23 13:10:09,wallstreetbets,CRISPR
2021-05-23 13:28:27,wallstreetbets,"Editas, crisper are two sure fired winners in this space! Editas had already eliminated sickle cell and infant blindness! Just rounding 3rd and coming in hot!

2021-05-23 13:38:45,wallstreetbets,"For me I have 30% of my portfolio in CRSP, and everytime it dips more I sell T and buy CRSP. I have have 20% split up into about 26 other genetics/bio companies. Mostly resembling ARKG lol
I have to be honest though since I started gambling in 2013 I have just wanted to Buy SpaceX shares, I would go 100% into SpaceX if I could."
2021-05-23 15:10:00,wallstreetbets,"Well yes, but hopefully I will take my huge profits in 10 years for the next ""thing"""
2021-05-23 11:12:33,wallstreetbets,Touche my friend
2021-05-23 11:08:50,wallstreetbets,"yeeeees..yeesss, come learn about options, we all float down here....😈"
2021-05-23 11:42:09,wallstreetbets,"If you’re not joking, it’s where you purchase the ability to buy 100 shares per contract of the contract strike price at any time up until the contract expires.

So easy numbers an $90 stock with a strike price $100 someone might offer to sell 1 contract for $300. So in the future you can buy 100 stock at any time until it expires. You make money because you spent $3 per stock premium, or $103 per stock, and the stock is now worth $125. 

If the stock goes down to $1 you don’t hold 9,000 in the red, you own $300."
2021-05-23 15:12:34,wallstreetbets,They have another one upcoming could be in June before the Branson flight that could be in July
2021-05-23 11:39:49,wallstreetbets,Why tf he think it’s going to go up $5-8 in a week tho? I get that it’s been historically volatile but i’d be nervous af and probably wouldn’t expect it to jump like that.
2021-05-23 12:50:52,wallstreetbets,Ty for explaining
2021-05-23 09:29:23,wallstreetbets,"As a Lebron hater for most of my life (I’m a Bulls fan), I’ve learned not to bet against him. Not only that, I live in Arizona and I don’t have much faith in the Suns."
2021-05-23 10:13:55,wallstreetbets,so he paid 25 dollars to potentially get 1000s back?
2021-05-23 13:24:48,wallstreetbets,Isn’t Elon already retarded and kinda evil though???
2021-05-23 13:26:50,wallstreetbets,"Hold up, does risking your life to fly a hot air balloon really make you retard?"
2021-05-23 13:19:20,wallstreetbets,Why evil?
2021-05-23 16:52:02,wallstreetbets,Why is Branson evil?
2021-05-23 14:06:22,wallstreetbets,BR went in on that one also.
2021-05-23 16:26:53,wallstreetbets,Sure..
2021-05-23 14:33:34,wallstreetbets,Sell the news.
2021-05-23 10:14:22,wallstreetbets,It's up 20% and the theta decay is about 20%
2021-05-23 17:27:58,wallstreetbets,Theta gang would like a word with you
2021-05-23 11:27:31,wallstreetbets,"You don't have to hit the strike price, it just needs to be higher than when you bought it. You can sell a call anytime. Only worth less if its really close to expiration due to theta"
2021-05-23 13:40:06,wallstreetbets,"I carry both, CRSP much  much heavier"
2021-05-23 11:24:28,wallstreetbets,Haha you make it sound so compelling
2021-05-23 12:41:56,wallstreetbets,"You’re only partly right and also you’re also only describing a buy on a call option contract.

Also, you don’t buy at the current price, you buy a call option and it entitles you the right to buy the stock at the strike price. If the option expires OTM, then you’re only out the premium on the option.

You can exercise the option at any time, but it’s not a good idea until the stock’s price increases above the strike price (in a call option) + the per-share premium."
2021-05-23 17:24:25,wallstreetbets,Won’t he get IV crushed ?
2021-05-23 11:47:03,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, it's a very risky play. More than likely it will expire worthless, imo. He should definitely sell it on Monday, or else theta and IV crush will considerably reduce his gains.

In contrast, I have $30 calls expiring March 2022. Percentage gain will be less, but it's a safer play."
2021-05-23 16:00:37,wallstreetbets,It went up almost $2 per day on Thursday and Friday. On a successful flight $5 increase on Monday is likely. Iv crush will kill it later in. The day Monday.
2021-05-23 09:41:22,wallstreetbets,Lebron has lost more championships than he has won.   If you bet against him you would be ahead.
2021-05-23 10:25:22,wallstreetbets,"Dude just Google your questions, investopedia will cover all the basics you need."
2021-05-23 10:28:21,wallstreetbets,"No, $25 is the strike he bet on. He paid 31k for the calls"
2021-05-23 12:17:51,wallstreetbets,"No, 31k spent. Potential to get ~80k"
2021-05-23 13:36:49,wallstreetbets,Na just retarded. He hasn't done anything with evil intent aside from being stingy with employee benefits.
2021-05-23 14:09:50,wallstreetbets,"He is still, by far, the worlds smartest african american"
2021-05-23 16:15:07,wallstreetbets,"Absolutely, yes. 100%"
2021-05-23 13:30:57,wallstreetbets,He's British.  Didn't you learn anything from Star Wars?
2021-05-23 17:30:06,wallstreetbets,"Agreed - it’ll pop a bit then tank in a week or two once everyone realizes that this company isn’t close to be profitable yet.

They need a good 10-20 years before this can become a profitable business model.

Also, all growth stocks are on a downward trend, so kinda irrelevant what they do right now."
2021-05-23 14:35:18,wallstreetbets,"nah that's silly in this case, imo. SPCE just became an actually viable company theres not much reason to expect it to drop soon"
2021-05-23 17:29:08,wallstreetbets,If you could please explain it to me I would be very thankful.
2021-05-23 11:54:34,wallstreetbets,There’s literally no downside.
2021-05-23 12:52:43,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the reply I should have mentioned it at the strike price for sure.
2021-05-23 09:42:47,wallstreetbets,"That’s a dumb argument, but I guess. Who’s beating the Lakers tho? Maybe Brooklyn has the offensive firepower, but they don’t have the defense."
2021-05-23 09:45:21,wallstreetbets,Never bet against the goat!
2021-05-23 13:58:10,wallstreetbets,Plus all the child labor
2021-05-23 14:42:00,wallstreetbets,I’ve had all my benefits paid 100% for over a decade by Elon. Not seeing what’s stingy about that
2021-05-23 14:46:07,wallstreetbets,How is he retarded?
2021-05-23 19:31:38,wallstreetbets,"I think you mean employee benefits, compensation, and labor laws.

He is a standard head of a company, but people suck his dick because he uses memes."
2021-05-23 13:52:02,wallstreetbets,"He's South African, so that would have been StarTrek"
2021-05-23 14:16:43,wallstreetbets,He reminds me of the boss from the IT crowd
2021-05-23 16:41:03,wallstreetbets,"OB1 wasn’t evil. We are not all evil, only the rich ones."
2021-05-23 14:50:53,wallstreetbets,"Man I hope for your sake you are right but you might wanna take a look around you brother.  Growth stocks are DOA and I think it only gets worse from here.  There is a reason Cathie Woods has been unloading SPCE every chance she gets.  Wait until the Fed is forced to raise interest rates because of the inflation explosion currently taking place.  You think the last drop was bad, you aint seen nothin yet."
2021-05-23 14:56:26,wallstreetbets,"And what is viable about charging rich elites 200K a pop to risk their lives to  enter low earth orbit before it glides back to Earth?   Yeah, I mean technically its considered ""Space"" but it certainly is nothing close to what most people consider when they hear the word.  I can assure you, tourists are not going to the moon or anywhere close to it any time soon.   I mean sure, alot of people will want to have the bragging rights of saying they did it but its def a ""one and done"" deal (you wont have much repeat business).  And man you get one fuck up and a few rich dudes die and your investment has basically evaporated overnight.  Yeah no thanks."
2021-05-23 17:34:11,wallstreetbets,"You’re looking for r/investing

Good luck, retard"
2021-05-23 12:18:23,wallstreetbets,It can't go tits up??
2021-05-23 15:18:31,wallstreetbets,I was not joking and very much appreciate everyone's response. I'll read it over again in alittle bit. It sort of just blew my mind. I would have assumed it was like shorting where you would be on the hook for a lot if things didn't pan out.
2021-05-23 09:44:33,wallstreetbets,Not dumb it’s facts.  Lebron is 4-6 in championships.  Everyone acts like he is such a winner but he isn’t.   The Nets look really tough.   I don’t think the Lakers will even make it to the west championships this year
2021-05-23 10:00:16,wallstreetbets,Is Michael Jordan still playing?
2021-05-23 14:32:00,wallstreetbets,Plus he's an African-American so be careful
2021-05-23 14:45:32,wallstreetbets,He doesn’t own the mines.
2021-05-23 14:59:21,wallstreetbets,"Elon seems like a good guy, but I still wouldn't want to work for him (directly). Articles paint him out to be like Steve Jobs with Aspergers which is crazy intimidating.

But I'll buy his stock."
2021-05-23 15:30:43,wallstreetbets,"Cool, good to know thats fake news, I was just going by the stories posted and available."
2021-05-23 13:55:30,wallstreetbets,I thought that would have been Space Balls.
2021-05-23 14:58:04,wallstreetbets,lol
2021-05-23 17:35:54,wallstreetbets,Why comment then retard? I'm fucking your wife as we speak
2021-05-23 12:30:07,wallstreetbets,My sources say no
2021-05-23 17:03:15,wallstreetbets,"Shorting is the opposite.

You borrow a $100 share from the broker and sell it for $100. You pay interest and have to give the share back. You want it to go to $1 because then you buy it for $1 and make $99 minus fees when you give it back. If it goes to $1000 and you hold 10k of them, we’ll as the saying goes, that’s the banks problem. They will margin call you though and sell your assets once you begin to be a risk."

2021-05-23 15:06:28,wallstreetbets,Articles are written to sell articles. They don’t write about him paying for peoples surgeries or paying their houses off. He’s not going to publicize it either.

He hired a guy for a top position, but when he was introduced to the team on day one the guy said something to his new coworkers that Elon didn't like. So Elon fired him on the spot at the introduction meeting in front of everybody.

Gangsta."
2021-05-23 18:23:26,wallstreetbets,"Oh let's take your word for it though.

Anyway, everyone, trust me.. Elon secretly frees human trafficked slaves in his free time but they won't publish articles about it.. /s"

OP bought options, 3 long calls specifically. Current price is the current price per share per contract, and average price is the price OP paid per share per contract. Each contract represents 100 shares of underlying security. So, OP is holding options that act as 300 shares of stock.
Therefore, ($17.70 - $0.46) * 300 = $5,172 loss.

2021-05-23 10:32:37,wallstreetbets,"Thanks. So op bought at avg. price and current price is market price, but the actual share price is $22? I don't get what the actual price on the bottom signifies."
2021-05-23 11:10:44,wallstreetbets,"Do you see the breakeven price is $65.70, and OP paid $17.70, so my guess is that OP was betting on the share price to be $48 by the time his contract expires. He says in another thread that he bought these options when the SPCE was around $45, so he expected it to go up, but instead the price dropped significantly - to $21.22 that you see on the bottom of the screenshot.
OP did not buy shares - he bought options, giving him the right to buy shares before expiration at the predetermined price. He paid $17.70 for each out of 300 shares to have that right. If SPCE was trading at $100 per share right now he could still buy it for only $65.70. Unfortunately, the price of underlying is much lower, so the contracts he owns cost a lot less too."
2021-05-23 12:06:24,wallstreetbets,"He never bought shares at any price, he bought options contracts.

His average price *to buy the contract* was 17.7 per share. That gives him the right to buy shares at the option's strike price. The current *actual share price,* of 21.20 is not the same as the cost to buy the option contract.

&nbsp;

I'm gathering that you really don't understand what options are versus shares, right?"
2021-05-23 12:18:37,wallstreetbets,"Oh I see, I'm trying to learn every day now, $17.70 just looked like a surprisingly large premium compared to other examples I've seen, I guess that's calculated by the broker?

So he bought at $48, breaking even if market price reaches $65.70 at any time before until, or just on the expiration date? But instead it went down to $22, so he doesn't buy but just loses the $17 premium per share?"
2021-05-23 13:16:38,wallstreetbets,"American style options can be exercised at any time before expiration, unlike European options. 

Really, the price per share doesn’t need to go up all the way to OP’s breakeven, there are other factors affecting the price of the option, like implied volatility (IV for short). Also theta, which is time decay, but that works against the option buyer. OP bought those contracts all the way back in February, so a lot of value already got eaten by the passage of time. IV spike might save him, but I doubt it."
2021-05-23 15:10:50,wallstreetbets,I see. How do European and American options differ? I'm guessing it depends on the location of the broker instead of the option buyer?
2021-05-23 15:27:23,wallstreetbets,I don’t know anything about European options except the single fact that they settle at expiration.

2021-05-23 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Detailed analysis on why UWMC’s addition to the MSCI World Small-Cap Index can be a significant catalyst **UPDATE:** /u/5349 made a critical observation (with a confirming follow-up source from /u/33zombee) that the market cap ranking for MSCI is ***free-float adjusted***. They only count publicly tradeable shares for the market cap. This would bring UWMC's market cap down to an adjusted $830 M or so, which will significantly drop the weighting. From [this list](https://www.ishares.com/uk/individual/en/products/296576/fund/1506575576011.ajax?fileType=csv&fileName=WSML_holdings&dataType=fund) of the iShares MSCI holdings, this will give UWMC a weighting of just **0.02%** rather than 0.16% as I had originally indicated. I am editing my OP below to reflect this correction. Apologies for not being diligent enough before writing this, and thanks to the additional diligence of those who pointed out the mistake!

One piece of news about United Wholesale Mortgage that has mostly gone under the radar is that UWMC will be included in the **MSCI World Small-Cap Index** starting on May 27. This has potential to be a significant catalyst next week, and I will lay out the reasons why here.

The list of new additions/deletions to this index can be found in the link to “MSCI Small Cap Indexes List of Additions/Deletions” on [this page](https://www.msci.com/index-review). UWMC appears on page 12 of this document as **“UWM HLDGS A”**.

There is understandably some skepticism involved in regards to UWM and indexes after the fiasco with the Russell 1000 inclusion back in March. The blame for that mistake rests fully with FTSE Russell, as individual companies have no say on their inclusion or exclusion from the published lists. FTSE mistakenly added UWMC to the Q1 *preliminary* IPO addition list, and then later did not include it in the final list after realizing that by their own rules they do not include SPACs and a SPAC merger does not count as an IPO. But some key differences exist here with the MSCI Index.

First, the list published by MSCI is already the *final* list. It’s a done deal that UWMC will be in the MSCI index, it simply has to go into effect officially at the close of market on May 27. The other key difference, and **one which could potentially make this MSCI index inclusion a** ***~~meaningfully~~*** **~~greater catalyst~~** (update: not as significant as originally thought) than UWMC’s June inclusion in the Russell 1000 index (for real this time), is the fact that UWMC is being listed in the *small-cap index*.

Why is it beneficial for UWMC to go in the *small-cap* index? It has to do with relative weighting within the index. Companies are ranked and weighted based on their relative market cap sizes within the index. The higher ranked companies get a higher weighting and thus make up a relatively larger percentage of the index. For example, the top holding in the MSCI World Small Cap Index is CZR which has a weight of 0.23% of the index. This means that any funds that track this index would have to purchase enough shares of CZR such that the stock makes up 0.23% of the total assets of the fund.

~~So how is this bullish for UWMC? Because when UWMC is added to the index, it will likely be one of the~~ **~~top ten in ranking~~** ~~(or just outside the top ten) based on its current market cap.~~ [~~This page~~](https://www.ishares.com/uk/individual/en/products/296576/ishares-msci-world-small-cap-ucits-etf-usd-(acc)-fund) ~~from BlackRock’s iShares MSCI World Small Cap ETF shows the top ten ranked holdings. TPR is the 9th company in this list (top is cash) as of May 20, 2021, with a relative weighting of 0.16%. As of the close of market Friday, TPR has a market cap of just under $12 Billion. In comparison, UWMC closed Friday with a higher market cap of $12.95 Billion. So this means that upon official inclusion, UWMC should be ranked right around the 10th place position, which should~~ **~~give it a weighting of approximately 0.16%~~**~~.~~

**(Update: Free float adjustment gives UWMC a market cap of around $830 M, giving it approximately a 0.02% weighting in the index)** 

This allows us to then calculate the approximate number of shares of UWMC that funds tracking the MSCI World Small-Cap Index will need to purchase when it is officially added. I found three main ETFs that track this index. There are likely other funds, but these three are sufficient I believe to make the case for why this is a meaningful catalyst.

>~~0.16%~~ (0.02%) \* $950 Million = ~~$1.52 Million~~ ($190 K), corresponding to ~~188,350~~ (23,500) shares @ $8.07.

In comparison, when UWMC is added to the Russell 1000, it will be ranked right around 550th place based on its current market cap, giving it a weighting of 0.03%. It’s inclusion in the Russell will still be a positive thing, given that there are many more funds that track the Russell than the MSCI index. ~~But because of the 5.3x higher weighting that UWMC will have in the MSCI index, this gives its inclusion some significant OOMPH (legitimate financial term)~~ (update: not as much OOMPH as originally thought). [Studies have shown](https://www.nber.org/digest/nov13/stock-price-reactions-index-inclusion) that when a stock moves from the Russell 1000 down to the Russell 2000 due to a reduction in its market cap, the share price tends to move *up* shortly thereafter, because now it is one of the top companies in its respective index (with a higher respective weighting) rather than one of the smallest.

TL;DR: it is better to be a BIG fish in a ^(small) (cap) index than to be a small fish in a large index. Thus, I believe we can anticipate good things ahead with UWMC’s inclusion in the MSCI World Small-Cap Index."

A company this size is a fkn cake-walk to control vs the other two.

This stock has done nothing but hover and go down.  I'm genuinely curious as to why it gets pimped in here so often as potentially getting squeezed when there is no catalyst in existence that would allow for a forced liquidation of shorters (other than GME causing forced liquidations and all hedges shorting UWMC and GME being forced to cover).

2021-05-23 12:02:34,wallstreetbets,"You made a critical observation and you're absolutely right. It is free float adjusted, and thus the free float adjusted market cap will indeed be significantly lower.

Ask yourself how a shorted stock jumps without a squeeze being involved.  The funds shorting will just let it explode?  If you are shorting a stock your job is not done until they are bankrupt or the price is so low you are willing to finally cover.

I'm asking why this stock has been flooding this sub since it was $10/share and now at $8/share I'm confused as to why it has so much traction."

2021-05-23 17:08:09,wallstreetbets,"Why would these index fund managers allow bets against their own position that would bring down the rate of return of their funds? Besides which, I don't believe funds that track indexes want to do this even if they stand to gain more because that would introduce tracking errors with the index. The point of these index funds is to match the performance of the indexes they are tracking as closely as possible, and if they start diverging from this then that would be problematic for the fund."
2021-05-23 12:16:18,wallstreetbets,I thought the 100%+ borrowing rates last week were a bit out of the ordinary

2021-05-23 05:55:07,wallstreetbets,I don't personally know but there's been a lot of discussion about it in the different posts
2021-05-23 09:01:34,wallstreetbets,"Exactly the opposite. You might as well live under the rock with these statements. In 2008 the banks were creating an artificial demand by approving everyone at bad rates and charging interest. This time around, the housing is on fire due to not enough supply, low interest rates (fed), and people having lots of cash from unemployment checks last year. None of those factors have much to do with the mortgage industry, but they are around to benefit from the situation. It’s a boring industry I agree, but they make more money than TSLA. You’re missing out on a great opportunity because of “I don’t care”..."

On one hand, i understand being uneducated, but when I give you the word and you still downvote, i feel pain for you.

Leaps are a way for you guys to get more shares for your money. You get deltax100 shares of exposure (more or less)

Call price/ (deltax100)= your discounted share price/

even better, when you buy shares on RH or w.e. they don'ty have to send that order to market and usually dont. but when you buy calls, they don't have any choice but to hedge.

They can fuck around with your margin shares all they want, but options put them at risk.

Also, you should check what financials are saying about the housing market. They're citing the fed's low interest policy as the very thing that's going to cause this industry to catch fire just as badly as it did before. The industry is due for an intervention because wealthy groups have a high incentive to hoard real estate at low rates, raising prices through artificial supply shortages - and it's not going to be pretty."

2021-05-23 15:57:22,wallstreetbets,I guess what I mean is: What number of shares (and whose shares?) are you subtracting from 103M to get the public float? Institutional? Insiders? Sasquatch's?
2021-05-23 10:22:34,wallstreetbets,">Either way, current situation is nowhere near a situation from 2008 - that you brought up.

Housing prices versus inflation. Home ownership rate versus housing supply, and housing availability. You're citing specific variables that aren't specifically the same, but the scenerio of a heavily manipulated market bubble that is going to burst, either forcibly or not, is there. Sign of how close we are to this burst: housing prices went up by 5% in the last *week*.

Which means that this company is making money today off of a market that's about to see the value of its assets get the axe. This is literally the top, or close to it. Will UWMC continue to profit? Probably, unless it suddenly finds the people it was lending to are going to try to exit their obligations. But profits off of far smaller mortgages will be lower by definition.

RKT and UWMC's similarities or dissimilarities are completely irrelevant. RKT is also a bland mortgage company. Its jump had everything to do with option mispricing and two squeezes. UWMC subsequently tried to ride the train, and was pushed here with a lot of low-karma accounts mostly peddling lies."

I just wanted to point out that you can’t use outstanding shares to calculate market share for the index, since the index is free float weighted. 

So float can be 76M (Yahoo), 90M (MarketWatch), or anything else, but it isn’t 103M."
2021-05-23 10:29:38,wallstreetbets,Just because there is a correction of the market doesn’t mean that the cycle won’t repeat and soon. The bubble will burst and then what?

2021-05-23 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"UFO ARKX options So I may or may not have been smoking weed when this idea came to me, but I was sober when I bought 4K in options for these space etfs.  I had the revelation that when the US government releases the UFO debrief it may cause an increase in interest in the space sector.  Increased interest in a sector is correlated with higher economic growth.  And when the two largest space etfs (UFO and ARKX) have combined assets of only 200 million there is lots of room for growth.  I really liked this idea and did more DD when I sobered up.  My first thought was that if the government doesn’t release the report then I’m fucked.  But recently more and more mainstream media have been writing about this upcoming debriefing.  As well as both parties calling for it to come out and be seriously discussed, examples are Marco Rubio and Harry reid, and Obama a couple days ago.  As well as agencies inside the department of defense leaking videos and reports about UFOs without consequence.  All this leads me to believe that the department of defense will actually release the report.  However the government is obviously not going to say aliens exist.  But they will have to acknowledge the unidentified aircrafts which can mean two things.  Either aliens exist or foreign nations have far superior technology.  If aliens exist then the space infrastructure sector that was previous only for rich billionaires, now has a practical and urgent purpose.  And if people think it’s another country then we will rush to match the technology.  These etfs contain both aerospace/ defense contractors and deep space infrastructure, so will come out on top either way.  Many institutional investors have stayed out of the space sector, but this report could give legitimacy to the sector as well as cathie woods backing ARKX may attract big investors.  So does this sound logical or am I a retarded ape?"

2021-05-23 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"In response to : ""Technical Analysis on Smoothed Moving Average (SMMA) indicator in the context of SPY day trading"" This asshat started tolling on my post (my perspective): [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ni4vcu/i\_spy\_521\_recap\_and\_524\_outlook/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ni4vcu/i_spy_521_recap_and_524_outlook/)

And then called me out in a post - without calling me out. [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nir8an/technical\_analysis\_on\_smoothed\_moving\_average/gz3yo7x/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nir8an/technical_analysis_on_smoothed_moving_average/gz3yo7x/?context=3)

So id just like to give my perspective on what I'm seeing on the charts. Its all in the eye of the beholder so take it as a grain of salt. This TA has helped me make money and, I believe, gives me an edge. But to each his own. If you are making money with your own method then congratulations. Not gonna poo all over you if it doesn't align with my method and strategies.

From the [5/21 read post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nhrou0/i_spy_521_read/)

A few things in TA my notes:

* called support and resistance levels.
* Called small moves
* Called that bulls need to break 418 and test 418 as support. As you can see we failed bulls.
* But bears did not break 414.
* Also called out a 20 SMMA test. Which we tested and failed.

[screen grab from 5\/21 post](https://preview.redd.it/vhi7x1l5or071.png?width=1508&format=png&auto=webp&s=2b7f89491be4eb7f6ab15b0c4e8149d803ada9f0)

From the spot gamma notes:

* look at abs gamma strike and look what was said.

[screen grab from 5\/21 post](https://preview.redd.it/j6xkdqb9pr071.png?width=1398&format=png&auto=webp&s=df15d5b87b146ca6cdf391dbc9fada46db89a1b2)

I'd like to address this chart and comment:

""Now please tell me which SMMA is acting as as support and which one as a resistance here? 60-day SMMA is definitely not a support because SPY was below that line half of the trading hours. 20-day SMMA is not a resistance because SPY was above that line for almost one third of the market hour.""

[ To express what I see I'll provide my chart:](https://preview.redd.it/0ghkrgvhkr071.png?width=1918&format=png&auto=webp&s=b99e69494648928d9891cb025a1da6b33f94835f)

Let's go back to the 20th first.

* 20 SMMA acted as support and was tested three times throughout the day on the 20th.
* The 20 SMMA would have played as a great indicator to BTFD for Friday.

https://preview.redd.it/1dnhk0s0lr071.png?width=3400&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c0dc044b41db5df168ee01cf164486e120281a5

Now lets focus on friday:

* Still have the 20 smma as support in the morning
* broke through 418 with blow-off top but failed to establish support.
* Tested 20 SMMA support at around 8 AM and failed but found support at top of gap (pretty common).
* Tested 20 SMMA as support at 9 AM but failed
* 20 SMMA now acted as resistance from about 9:15 - 11:30 (two fucking hours) Scalpers delight! Easily a 1x-3x bagger on an O'Hare.
* As you can see we bounced off the 120 SMMA and found support.
* The essentially consolidated for the rest of the day. ""*Consolidation* is the term for a *stock* or security that is neither continuing nor reversing a larger price trend. *Consolidated stocks* typically trade within limited price ranges and offer relatively few *trading* opportunities until another pattern emerges.""

https://preview.redd.it/7y89c2awqr071.png?width=3400&format=png&auto=webp&s=83d8c18d5dcf4bd08b12a1ac9e0cb00c0ee9d107

Taking this comment into account: ""Now if you believe in these indicators and bought 0 DTE FD calls as a hope that 60-day SMMA will save you, you know what would happen.""

Let's look at the RSI at the blow off top.  If you started buying O'Hare calls here then you belong in this sub.

https://preview.redd.it/s2vvxf86vr071.png?width=3400&format=png&auto=webp&s=eca2606d4187b2ff947c6d1cfbd713101b2d9d01

TLDR - use basic ta for support and resistance. Use more than one indicator to confirm trends. Read my posts as conditional statements. If you have questions - ask - BUT don't be a dick. I provide bullish and bearish pts because like everyone else I don't know where the market is going to go in the future. SMMAs are a great tool but not good used by themselves. Use them to determine strength of trends IMO. Use them for shorting and buying opportunities off of bounces and rejections.

[Or just trade like this guy does with his ""ears to the ground"" and ""eyes open""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-qa7N-GJ-c)

2021-05-22 23:43:49,wallstreetbets,"When SPY price is above 20-day SMMA you are calling it a support

When SPY price is below 20-day SMMA you are again calling it support

Question?

**What is a support actually? If SP break some line and stay above that line? If don't stay above that line that's also support? What is resistance then? Based on your argument you can call any line above or below as support. Even when SP goes up and down above and below that line multiple times. You are now completely changing the meaning of support.**

You are saying at higher prices such as 419, 420, 422 you are bullish but you do understand that price goes higher when demand is more than supply, right? You also understand that if price goes up then RSI will also goes up, right? Which means RSI can go to overbought territory.

Now question.

**Next Monday if SPY goes to $419.7 and RSI goes to 82. Now you are in bullish territory based of SPY price but RSI is indicating over bought. Will you buy call or puts? Because whatever you buy you will contradict yourself.**

Same goes if SPY drops to $408 and RSI also goes to oversold territory.

Also, you will see that price goes up or down slowly without disturbing RSI significantly and then suddenly change direction when RSI is barely 40 or 60 (in your graph).

What period you used to calculate RSI in that chart? I can show that SPY was never overbought or never oversold on Friday just by changing the parameters.

You actually proved nothing here. I asked you some simple questions several times. You never answered them. You wrote a post here but still did not answer my questions.

Drawing colorful lines using a trading software doesn't make you an expert if you can't even define what is ""support"". Stock price goes above a line and stay there few moment and goes below that line and stay there sometimes. That line is anything but ""support"""

Since the price moves up and down - support and resistance are fluid - especially with short term trends -  support can become resistance and resistance can become support. Supports and resistances are best used for determining your enter and exit points - to help you strategize  your moves for the day.

**What is a support actually? If SP break some line and stay above that line? If don't stay above that line that's also support? What is resistance then? Based on your argument you can call any line above or below as support. Even when SP goes up and down above and below that line multiple times. You are now completely changing the meaning of support.**

Note: This is just talking about the 5m timeframe. Your SMMAs are going to be different on longer timeframes. This is why using multiple timeframes is very important in determining mid-term and long-term trends (with long-term trends this is why you hear ""stonks only go up"".) Look at spy longterm - it only goes up.

The strength of a support is determined  by how many times the prices ""bounces off it""  Same for the strength of a resistance. (I could get into top call/put strikes and max pain and other spotgamma data but I'm just really addressing SMMAs)

I pointed out that the 20 smma was a good support indicator on 5/20 since it bounced off it a few times throughout the day. This indicated that the bulls were in charge for the day - notice the strong uptrend by how far spread out your 20, 60, and 120 SMMAs are?

When the price consolidates around an SMMA it means that there is a battle and a possible reversal may take place. For example, if in a downtrend - bulls need to increase buying pressure to have a reversal.

Notice how we had that blow-off top at around 418 and had a very bearish engulfing candle throw us back down into the 417-418 resistance range? That told me that there was a good chance that we were going to test the 20 SMMA for support.

If support held, we may see a reversal back up to 418 but if it failed then watch out. So, look at the battle that took place and notice that the price moved in and out of the 20 SMMA. The price essentially consolidated. And remember the definition of consolidation: ""Consolidation is the term for a stock or security that is neither continuing nor reversing a larger price trend. Consolidated stocks typically trade within limited price ranges and offer relatively few trading opportunities until another pattern emerges.""

Here is the consolidation I'm talking about: [https://www.tradingview.com/x/uZCZcYcZ/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/uZCZcYcZ/)

Bulls and bears are battling. Once we broke out of that consolidation range. The bears gained the 20 SMMA as resistance and were now in control until the bulls found support at the 120 SMMA.

**You are saying at higher prices such as 419, 420, 422 you are bullish but you do understand that price goes higher when demand is more than supply, right? You also understand that if price goes up then RSI will also goes up, right? Which means RSI can go to overbought territory.**

I provide bullish and bearish price targets for the day. This means that I'm trimming or taking profits if we hit those levels. I will also take profit if we are near a highlighted resistance or support level. Especially if indicators are telling me that we are overbought or oversold. If we break through resistance and find support on top of that resistance line then I'll enter back in. Inverse if bear.

Yes. I know that RSI can go past 70. It all depends on risk management. If i'm playing 0dte and we are near oversold or overbought I will secure profits. I got kids to feed friend :)

**Next Monday if SPY goes to $419.7 and RSI goes to 82. Now you are in bullish territory based of SPY price but RSI is indicating over bought. Will you buy call or puts? Because whatever you buy you will contradict yourself.**

I would have already taken profit since it hit a bullish price target. Then i'll reassess  and determine my next play based on current trend and indicators.

Truthfully, If i make a good play and make good money I'll be done for the day and wait for the market to close to analyze and strategize for the next day. A lot of times I only make about 1-3 trades per day. There have been times where I don't make any trades because I'm not seeing a favorable set-up - especially if I'm not already playing. 

**What period you used to calculate RSI in that chart? I can show that SPY was never overbought or never oversold on Friday just by changing the parameters.**

**Drawing colorful lines using a trading software doesn't make you an expert if you can't even define what is ""support"". Stock price goes above a line and stay there few moment and goes below that line and stay there sometimes. That line is anything but ""support""**

When you replied to the question about if SPY hits $419.7 Monday you said, ""I would have already taken profit since it hit bullish price target"". Is that implying you bought calls at day start? Or how would you have made profit by that point please"
2021-05-23 14:29:59,wallstreetbets,"u/jjd1226 Thank you for taking the time and trying to answer my questions. You were late and tired and that's why probably you might missed my actual questions. Let's do a little discussion-

**My question was:**

What is a support actually? If SP break some line and stay above that line? If don't stay above that line that's also support? What is resistance then? Based on your argument you can call any line above or below as support. Even when SP goes up and down above and below that line multiple times. You are now completely changing the meaning of support.

**Your response:**

>Since the price moves up and down - support and resistance are fluid - especially with short term trends - support can become resistance and resistance can become support. Supports and resistances are best used for determining your enter and exit points - to help you strategize your moves for the day.

**OP define support first and then discuss the properties of support!** You said support can become resistance and resistance can become support. But what is support? What is resistance? If you do not define clearly what is support first then rest of your text are pointless. Let me do the job for you from borrowing the definition from Investopedia, which you like to refer. The next paragraph is copied from Investopedia-

From here: [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/support.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/support.asp)

**What Is Support?**

Support, or a support level, refers to the price level that an asset does not fall below for period of time. An asset's support level is created by buyers entering the market whenever the asset dips to a lower price. In technical analysis, the simple support level can be charted by drawing a line along the lowest lows for the time period being considered. The support line can be flat or slanted up or down with the overall price trend. Other technical indicators and charting techniques can be used to identify more advanced versions of support.

Similarly the definition of Resistance from the same source-

**What Is Resistance?**

Resistance, or a resistance level, is the price at which the price of an asset meets pressure on its way up by the emergence of a growing number of sellers who wish to sell at that price. Resistance levels can be short-lived if new information comes to light that changes the overall market’s attitude toward the asset, or they can be long-lasting. In terms of technical analysis, the simple resistance level can be charted by drawing a line along the highest highs for the time period being considered. Resistance can be contrasted with support.

**Simplify this way:** 

For the time being considered, price will be above the support level and below Resistance level.

**Why I ever asked you any questions:** 

*Because you kept referring 20 SMMA as support and then as resistance when it met the definition of neither for the time being considered. Because SPY went down that 20 SMMA level several time so it was not a support. Similarly SPY went above that level several times so it was not a resistance.*

**The definition of the support and resistance is the reason TA traders try to enter a long (i.e. call) position around support level because they believe that price will bounce up from that level and will not fall below that level. Which means he can sell his calls the way up and make profit**. But if he sees that price doing up and down from a level he will not consider it a support or resistance because that level (20 SMMA in your chart) does not meet the definition of support neither it meet the definition of resistance.

**TlDr: You wrote so much but never really answered my question.** 

Continued in next comment due to word limitation."
2021-05-23 14:41:53,wallstreetbets,"**Then you wrote:**  


Note: This is just talking about the 5m timeframe. Your SMMAs are going to be different on longer timeframes. This is why using multiple timeframes is very important in determining mid-term and long-term trends (with long-term trends this is why you hear ""stonks only go up"".) Look at spy longterm - it only goes up.The strength of a support is determined by how many times the prices ""bounces off it"" Same for the strength of a resistance. (I could get into top call/put strikes and max pain and other spotgamma data but I'm just really addressing SMMAs)

  
**This was one of my original questions. I asked you several times there are many variations in indicators how someone choose one because one of my main objection against TA is the lack of guideline to pick specific combinations. You wrote all these text to say what exactly? I can go one by one all of them but since none of the text really addressed my actual questions, I will touch some points-**  


You use SMMAs a lot but it appeared to me from your comments that you are not completely aware of what they are doing really. SMMA is a moving average filter and one of the parameter is the how many data points you are taking to calculate that average. You can take 20, 50, 60, 100, 150, 200 etc. If a stock or ETF or any financial instrument is on a consistent uptrend then following will be true-

  
1.	Price chart will be always above the SMMA lines except when there is a strong downtrend.  
2.	20-day SMMA will be closer to actual price movement, 50-day SMMA will be below 20-day SMMA, 100-day SMMA will be below 50-day SMMA, 1. 200-day SMMA will be below 100-day SMMA and so on.  


On a consistent downtrend, the exact opposite will be true. The larger day SMMA will be far above the instrument price. That's just the nature of the filter itself. A 200-day SMMA line is still influenced by stock price 200-days ago but a 20-day SMMA line is only affected by last 20 day price action. On a consistent uptrend a instrument price will be much smaller 200 days ago compare to 20 days ago because it's a consistent uptrend.  
For the same reason at extended consolidation period, these SMMA curves will go across the price actions. The less the number of days you take account (20 vs 60) the more it (SMMA) will be closer to actual price action.  
  
  
**What is my point here:** 

**You can not or should should not use an SMMA whether it's 20-day or 60-day as support or resistance because SMMA does not determine the price action of a financial instrument rather it's completely the other way around. Price action of a financial instrument (Stonks, ETF etc.) shape the SMMA curve/lines.** If you do not understand this ask me I can talk all day if I have time. Designing filters in Matlab or Python to analyze experimental data is what I do and have been doing most part of my life.  


**My next question was:**

  
You are saying at higher prices such as 419, 420, 422 you are bullish but you do understand that price goes higher when demand is more than supply, right? You also understand that if price goes up then RSI will also goes up, right? Which means RSI can go to overbought territory.  
Next Monday if SPY goes to $419.7 and RSI goes to 82. Now you are in bullish territory based of SPY price but RSI is indicating over bought. Will you buy call or puts? Because whatever you buy you will contradict yourself.  


**Your Response was:**

and  
some more text

OP, I asked you specifically with price and RSI whether you will buy calls or puts and you answered you will sell at that moment.   
When did you buy those that you are talking about selling at the condition I mentioned? Your bullish target was above $419 and bearish target was below $412 for 5/24. SPY was between $414.45 and $418.2 on Friday and closed at $414.94. It was never in your bullish or bearish territory based on the outlook you provided for 05/24 (Monday). Market is not open yet for 05/24 so when did you buy the positions you are referring to trim at my proposed price target and RSI?  


Your outlook for 05/21 was Bullish/Neutral. While SPY did gap up slightly but it was a downtrend for half of the day from the beginning of the market. The rest half was jerking off movements. It was never really bullish or bearish on that day. Now let me ask you again-  


**OP did you open position expiring on 05/24? If you did then based on what exactly? If you did not then why are you talking about taking profit for those imaginary positions that you have not bought yet?**  


Let me ask the same question with more clearly-  


**If tomorrow Monday (05/24) SPY gap up and open at $419.7 and RSI at 82 at market open, you will in bullish territory based of SPY price but RSI is indicating over bought. Will you buy call or puts? Because whatever you buy you will contradict yourself.**  


**If SPY open flat at $415 and moderate RSI at 45, you are neither in bullish territory nor in bearish based on SPY price and RSI is neither indicating over bought or oversold. Will you buy call or puts? Why?**

2021-05-23 09:17:22,wallstreetbets,"In context of an FD. So my go to play on Friday's is to play a strangle at two of my levels with a next friday exp. [https://imgur.com/tpAkzbC](https://imgur.com/tpAkzbC)

So, on Monday after about 30 min into trading or so, I'll play an ITM FD - either a put or call - depending how i'm perceiving indicators and charts. I also use spotgamma for options data. I also use  s/l  in case I miss time an entrance or misread the indiactos. Ill also look at the order book to see whats coming through the tape.  

So current SPY price is 415. If it looks bullish ill play a 415c and look at trimming at the 418 resistance and leave a few runners if SPY can push to that 419 bullish pt.  

I hope this answers your question."
2021-05-23 11:37:46,wallstreetbets,Just to clarify. I was already in a 415c that I purchased on thursday. I took profit at 418 when I saw the bearish engulfing. I then played a 418p until about 414. At end of day I played that strangle. Hope this makes sense. Ill close the strangle out once/if price target is achieved at 419-422 or 405-400 since my thesis is that we will end near 420 or 405-400 towards end of week.

2021-05-23 09:24:09,wallstreetbets,One last question please. Why choose 415c over 416-418c when you have indications it'll rise to 418 for example. All hypothetical. I'm just curious your thought pattern when choosing what value c/p to buy with your expertise on likely outcomes.
2021-05-23 15:31:58,wallstreetbets,"I was really expecting something similar to what you just wrote based on your previous responses.

Just as a reminder If an instrument price goes back and forth above and below a level, that level is neither ""Support"" nor ""Resistance"". If you are defining $415 as the support and SPY jumping to $417.5 and then going back to 413.25, back and forth. Then-

Define $417.5 (or $418 doesn't need to be exact) as resistance and 413.25 ( or $413) as support.

No moving average, be it simple (or smoothed whatever you call it) moving average (SMA/SMMA)  or exponential moving average dictate the price action, hence CANNOT  act as support or resistance. Price action determines how the shape of a moving average line will be.

Try to learn answering a straight question straightly and if you do not know the answer say it there is nothing wrong with that. You don't have to elusive or contradictory in your response.

Have a nice rest of the day."

2021-05-23 09:29:09,wallstreetbets,I consider an ITM fd a safety net just in case market reverses. With theta decay that 418 FD will lose value super fast if market reverses.

2021-05-23 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Buffet's Right Hand Man Buys $BABA. $BABA Becomes the Top Undervalued Stock to Buy Now on Reddit. Alibaba Becomes the [Top Undervalued Stock to Buy Now According to Reddit.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-best-undervalued-stocks-buy-133333592.html)

First off, if you've been living under a rock and don't know what Alibaba is, here's a video about what the company does from CNN Business. [https://www.cnn.com/videos/business/2021/05/21/marketplace-asia-alibaba-cainiao.cnnbusiness](https://www.cnn.com/videos/business/2021/05/21/marketplace-asia-alibaba-cainiao.cnnbusiness)

Alibaba, the mega-cap Chinese conglomerate has had a rough 6 months. After for CEO Jack Ma ticked off the CCP, the company was slapped with billions in anti-competitive fines and then the U.S. is pushing for all Chinese stocks on the U.S. markets be audited using U.S. standards. This has caused the stock to drop from it's highs of $319 to just $210 as of Friday. I normally stay away from Chinese stocks, but I took notice when these two firms took large positions at the $225-$245 range...Generation Investment Management (founded by former VP Al Gore) and the Daily Journal (led by Charlie Munger....Warren Buffet's right hand man.)

Why do I care about these two firms? Well Al Gore's firm based out of London mainly invests in companies that environmentally sustainable (basically they just monitor their carbon footprint), something I like to hear. Gore's firm nearly DOUBLED their position in $BABA in Q1. $BABA had just reported its first ever loss after the CCP slapped it with anti-competitive fines of over 18 billion yen (3.6b U.S.) causing fear that additional actions could be taken. In addition to the fines, the U.S. wants all Chinese companies listed in the U.S. to undergo audits according to U.S. accounting practices. At the time, it seemed the bad news was baked in and the behemoth had reached rock bottom. Now after the recent selloff in stocks, $BABA sits at $210, roughly 10% off it's 52 week low.

Now what REALLY turned my head was reading that [Munger had put in an investment that represented nearly 20% of the Daily Journal's portfolio](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/charlie-mungers-daily-journal-buys-162550289.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAANWUgsT5pGhYhcHBDH3BmAeqjyPDiJhY46k1tJyHfgxNp1KXjoNUp_RUeUxc9964F9DRudOxJfqmOg2xTb0Bce561ukNR_6nLr7xj7-zvq7G6DV89DfgNfLOnzdtlnrj47ITxpu0SSCY4sEXz9qyDqqkh7JsvoXakKYZtyYt7dK)! First off, the Daily Journal only holds 5 stocks...(in order) $BAC, $WFC, $BABA, $USB, and $POSCO. For Munger, one of THE most risk-adverse investors in history, to invest (and make it his 3rd largest holding), he and his team must view that stock as EXTREMELY undervalued. For a wide-moat mega-cap stock to have a 50% upside ([52 analyst price targets](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BABA/)), the current price is truly insane. In their view, a company with 91% penetration in the internet services, streaming, fintech, retail, and cloud storage (they're currently investing HEAVILY into this sector...similar to Amazon) that trades at a mere 26x earnings yet is growing at a CAGR of 18% is simply too good to pass up.

Since Munger's position was revealed, Reddit users took notice and has become the most talked about undervalued stock on Reddit.

In short, there are times when investing seems easy. As Buffett says ""We simply attempt to be greedy when others are fearful, and fearful when others are greedy."""

2021-05-23 14:05:59,wallstreetbets,"How does BABA fail? What kind of optical and or political disruption sink this stock further? Personally I am concerned with the paid review controversy going on in the asian electronic marketing system. Little oversight on that creates low credibility for sellers and low confidence from the consumer. AMZN just I the past few weeks did a major crack down, and BABA must be on notice to do the same (or not, or maybe it happened and I haven't read about it). 

I love the stock and since it's only $5 dollars off it's 52 week low, I think it's a fucking great entry point. Still calculating the socio variables."
2021-05-23 15:56:53,wallstreetbets,I'm Long 25 calls of BABA.
2021-05-23 09:37:45,wallstreetbets,The general hate on here towards baba is why I'm all in on it. Baba will catch on soon op.  This is how everyone thought of gme a year and half ago too.
2021-05-23 14:22:53,wallstreetbets,Baba will be nationalized and under communists management in the next year!
2021-05-23 01:27:24,wallstreetbets,"BABA and TSLA should merge. New ticker BATSLA, ready to take on AAPL and AMZN."

2021-05-23 17:29:13,wallstreetbets,"Name the time horizon you think he ""underperforms"".
Value investing underperforms when Mr Market becomes irrational. Over the long run those dudes beat the shit out of the market.
Buffett and the other super investor from Graham and Doddsville have >+20%  pa for over 50 years. And this is despite underperforming the last 10 (due to the longest bull run in history with QE)

Rule of thumb:
When the best value investors underperform, the market is very frothy and you should become cautious."

2021-05-23 18:17:38,wallstreetbets,I met there was the giant fine an all 🙄
2021-05-23 08:59:57,wallstreetbets,"I would normally agree, as I mentioned I typically stay away from Chinese stocks. But after reading that Munger, who's like, one of the most risk adverse investors in history, takes a huge position (now his 3rd largest holding)...well I got that warm and fuzzy feeling that it's going to be OK."
2021-05-22 23:27:33,wallstreetbets,Don’t trust this guy and his alt /u/Uncle_Pennywise who coincidentally posts on all his threads backing him up. Confirmed this is alibaba trying to get investors.

2021-05-22 21:54:38,wallstreetbets,Might want to roll those out just to be safe. You know how market has been lately with all the inflation talks.
2021-05-23 01:49:46,wallstreetbets,Now that’s something I can get behind

2021-05-22 22:36:09,wallstreetbets,I'd argue that's already been baked into the stock price.
2021-05-23 01:50:04,wallstreetbets,What does it mean what does it mean
2021-05-23 00:06:01,wallstreetbets,I find it amusing that you have 10k post karma and haven't figure out how to reply to comments in your own post. Makes me smirk just a bit.
2021-05-23 01:46:41,wallstreetbets,What do admirals know though? Like for real
2021-05-23 05:43:36,wallstreetbets,You don’t watch much military tech news do you
2021-05-23 01:46:15,wallstreetbets,Tell me it wouldn’t feel even better at 47.6% off though? Tell me that and I’ll change my mind and I’ll put ONE MILLION DOLLARS towards your project

2021-05-23 01:49:26,wallstreetbets,Forget BABA the next HOT stock is Aerotyne
2021-05-22 22:28:22,wallstreetbets,I don't think you know what you're talking about.  BABA couldn't possibly drop more than its $200 level and the government intervention is already in the past. That 'government intervention' risk is a risk factor that is being thrown around since BABA first listed on NYSE and yet it didn't stop it from reaching the levels they currently are at.
2021-05-23 14:50:55,wallstreetbets,"Nah, can you imagine how much foreign $$ would be pulled outta that country if they did that? It'd be a disaster. $BABA is their cash cow. The fear is overblown. Probably why Munger invested"

2021-05-23 18:15:50,wallstreetbets,"Nope, check the Alibaba annual report, they explain the shareholding structure much better than me but basically Alibaba Group Holdings has a bunch of subsidiaries in China which have VIE agreements and loans to the operating entities like Taobao and Alibaba Cloud which gives AGH effective control over them. This way there’s no way to buy actual Alibaba stock as the company just isn’t structured like that."
2021-05-23 10:38:22,wallstreetbets,Yes lol. The global economy is hurting more than most think.

2021-05-23 19:59:06,wallstreetbets,"Wish I knew anything about calls, Puts etc. I simply buy/sell (trade) no idea about options, Shorts etc. I often wonder if I'm better off not knowing or if I'm losing opportunities to grow exponentially."

2021-05-23 08:39:55,wallstreetbets,Sell it at market open if it still green. Prob won’t be though. You should’ve sold fri before close.
2021-05-23 00:20:59,wallstreetbets,Y’all need to ditch Robinhood and start WRITING options with TD. If you aren’t buying options to hedge you’re on the wrong side of the coin.
2021-05-23 00:20:12,wallstreetbets,Sell it on Thursday 20% up
2021-05-23 03:28:43,wallstreetbets,Lmao hell nooo jk 😂
2021-05-23 10:34:54,wallstreetbets,What was the IV when you bought it?
2021-05-23 19:15:19,wallstreetbets,YUP
2021-05-23 09:30:12,wallstreetbets,Actual good advice
2021-05-23 05:58:46,wallstreetbets,Nah keep the July calls for the next test flight
2021-05-23 12:21:47,wallstreetbets,Learn????
2021-05-23 12:47:19,wallstreetbets,Yep
2021-05-23 05:40:46,wallstreetbets,Everyone sell their AMC shares and buy this. Asap.
2021-05-22 22:27:47,wallstreetbets,Ain’t shit moonin for more than 8 hours anymore.
2021-05-23 00:10:04,wallstreetbets,I would double down Monday ASAP
2021-05-23 05:41:38,wallstreetbets,Everyone sell any AMC you have. Buy this stock asap.
2021-05-23 12:16:33,wallstreetbets,"I disagree, bro.  The flight window was scheduled to begin in May and go through October, the May 22nd flight was only announced Thursday and that was the catalyst for the end of the week run up.  Given their history of postponing flights and technical delays, there is a ton of short interest on this stock AND the test flight went perfectly, which is huge considering the added pressure Virgin is now feeling from Blue Origin announcing their upcoming flight.  The last time the stock had a test flight announcement, it hit near $60, so considering this was a milestone moment for a currently very niche market company putting them in 1st position in the space tourism race, people are gonna be hungry to get in while the price is down.  Couple that with shorts most likely having to cover and I personally (as a retard) believe there is a lot of room to move, especially Monday.  I am holding calls expiring on 5/28 though, so of course I need for all that to happen.  Good luck to everyone!"
2021-05-22 23:17:31,wallstreetbets,This
2021-05-23 10:51:36,wallstreetbets,Unlikely.. every fucker thought this was another delayed delay announcement. So many shorters an sideliners.
2021-05-22 21:33:27,wallstreetbets,"The reasons why it went from $15 to $60 and back to $15 are important.

After the sucessful flight today and the multiple catalysts ahead this year, he should be fine."
2021-05-23 19:02:57,wallstreetbets,I have 25c expiring next week that I brought on Friday. Will I get IV crushed ?
2021-05-23 19:03:49,wallstreetbets,Won’t he be IV crushed ?
2021-05-23 19:04:07,wallstreetbets,Will he get Iv crushed ?
2021-05-23 12:31:07,wallstreetbets,"So he should've sold on Friday, before the company pulled off a perfect test flight?  I know you're a retard, but c'mon dude."
2021-05-23 02:14:07,wallstreetbets,"Why TD? They charge 0.65 per options contract. OP saved $32. Not as noticeable with a big win, buy when writing lots of contracts it adds up."
2021-05-23 01:06:39,wallstreetbets,"Curious, what's your average return writing options in a year? I've been looking at them and I'm estimating ~50% from just writing safe spy or ndx puts every 2 weeks."
2021-05-23 10:35:15,wallstreetbets,Around 110-120%
2021-05-23 12:04:58,wallstreetbets,2 weeks left in the month after the latest July call option expires.  I'm selling 90% tomorrow and buying in on October Calls to cover July's test flight.

2021-05-23 11:15:07,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-05-23 12:18:42,wallstreetbets,Why are almost all of your comments telling people to sell AMC?
2021-05-23 13:33:13,wallstreetbets,"Thank you for the detailed reply. Your research goes much deeper than mine and I understand the nuance better now! I was only stating that it's priced in because I figured this had to be a known test event but apparently it was not as much of a certainty as I understood it to be. Good luck to those with calls, still be careful!"
2021-05-22 23:42:15,wallstreetbets,"That. Everybody thinks rocket, that means tank"
2021-05-23 11:40:32,wallstreetbets,">another delayed delay announcement.

Wut?"
2021-05-23 14:13:14,wallstreetbets,Market is full of fuckery right now. Let’s see what happen’s Monday. I’d be selling on the open.
2021-05-23 10:59:01,wallstreetbets,"TD is one of the few that will let you write naked. Seriously $.65? Even on a $100 contract that’s .65%. My average contracts are for $1,500 or more and my goal is to write for expiration."
2021-05-23 11:07:40,wallstreetbets,"I don’t write on weekly expiration dates, only 3rd Friday of the month. I typically write shorter term puts 3-6 months and look for them to expire. I’ve doubled my account from 125k to 250k since May 2021. About 1/3 of that is from dividends and stock value appreciation the rest is from writing mainly puts."
2021-05-23 10:45:28,wallstreetbets,And you bought 15-20 delta calls? You need SPCE to really moon to outpace the IV crush. Unless IV go up along with the price hike. You'll be up biggly.
2021-05-23 14:04:47,wallstreetbets,What fucking sub am I reading?
2021-05-23 14:05:04,wallstreetbets,The IV on may 28 calls I bought on Thursday were 123 percent I think. Will my calls still print ? 25 C
2021-05-23 11:29:33,wallstreetbets,Amc will never reach 10k. I'm right. Bye.
2021-05-23 13:00:12,wallstreetbets,Because amc is going to crash very soon. Very important to save you all from losing money. Important to sell before 2 June.
2021-05-23 13:59:21,wallstreetbets,"Ah, gotcha. That makes sense. I write lots of options on smaller caps, so it would prolly add up to a few thousand a year for me. Naked options do sound enticing, though!"
2021-05-23 10:59:48,wallstreetbets,Good point. But I do think it will moon tomorrow
2021-05-23 19:05:23,wallstreetbets,I bought may 28 calls 25 strike on Thursday. Will IV crush me ?
2021-05-23 14:16:55,wallstreetbets,Do some research on “IV Crush”
2021-05-23 11:35:03,wallstreetbets,Bye now
2021-05-23 15:22:07,wallstreetbets,You poor thing. Clearly you were dropped as a child.
2021-05-23 14:23:34,wallstreetbets,Why would it even crash more than it already has...
2021-05-23 14:25:44,wallstreetbets,Ik what IV crush is ... I just don’t know I will get IV crushed since the IV can still increase tomm
2021-05-23 16:26:33,wallstreetbets,"The IV doesn’t just randomly increase. For it to increase tomorrow, a big event or something of the sort would have to be announced as coming up this week. At the same time IV doesn’t randomly get crushed either. If there are any big events scheduled in the upcoming week, I would exit the position before they end. If not, then exit whenever."
2021-05-23 16:31:14,wallstreetbets,I bought may 28 calls at 25 strike on Friday. Spce had a succesfull launch. Would I get IV crushed in this case ?
2021-05-23 16:46:12,wallstreetbets,"Definitely— whether successful or not, the surprise is gone. After a quick look at the options chain, the IV seems to drop weekly around 4% but the drop from this week to the next is around 70%. This one, in my opinion, is going to be a gamble. The question is will the price increase by enough to offset the crush? Also, when checking the May 28th $28C, I noticed that IV is at 237.49%, not 123%. However, if the call’s IV truly was at 123% when you bought it, then it’ll most likely print on Monday 💵"
2021-05-23 16:50:31,wallstreetbets,May 28 25C not 28C
2021-05-23 16:51:43,wallstreetbets,"Oh yea, my bad. IV doesn’t change much between those two tho. Only a 7% difference, which is negligible compared to the crush.  It really depends on when you bought it. If you’re remembering correctly the IV being at 123% when u bought the calls, I don’t think you have anything to worry about."
2021-05-23 16:57:01,wallstreetbets,"So if the stock price let’s say goes to 25 tommorow which is my strike price, is there a chance I print 200-300 percent ?"
2021-05-23 16:58:56,wallstreetbets,"I can’t say the exact percent, cuz Idk what the price was exactly at when u bought the calls, but, if you’re not misremembering the IV being at 123% at the time of your purchase, I think you’ll definitely make a huge profit with SPCE going to $25."
2021-05-23 17:01:55,wallstreetbets,I mean I bought most of my calls on Thursday bought a few Friday I’m pretty sure they were 123 percent IV. I’m currently up 30 percent and my average on the calls is 0.71.
2021-05-23 17:02:55,wallstreetbets,"I don’t think you have anything to worry about with the calls that were bought at the 123% IV level. The other ones may weigh you down a bit, because of the crush, but I think you’ll come out green"
2021-05-23 17:06:02,wallstreetbets,Holy moly the IV on the calls is 230 percent rn. Is there a way I can check what the Iv was when I bought them just to double check?
2021-05-23 17:53:52,wallstreetbets,"Maybe there’s a website that shows the option stats for different days and timestamps, but I’m not too sure. If you’re sure you bought it at 123%, I wouldn’t worry, unless you think u may have accidentally looked at the next week’s options."
2021-05-23 18:03:29,wallstreetbets,Hm idk but I don’t think I bought them at 200 percent plus range. Welp let’s see what happens tomm if spce goes up and I lose momey on my calls that’ll be a sucker

I read that ByteDance plans to go public in 2021. Does anyone have any additional information? I will be putting money in them when they do go public. 

 The 38-year-old AI coding genius, searching for ByteDance’s next big act, has set his sights on China’s $1.7 trillion e-commerce arena. The co-founder has hired thousands of staff and roped in big-name sponsors like Xiaomi Corp. impresario Lei Jun to drive what he calls his next “major breakthrough” into global business -- selling stuff to consumers via its addictive short videos and livestreams. That endeavor will test not just Zhang’s magic touch with app creation and ByteDance’s AI wizardry, but also investor reception ahead of one of the tech world’s most hotly anticipated IPOs."

2021-05-22 22:37:59,wallstreetbets,Too many words. Cool pictures. I’m in.
2021-05-22 21:08:00,wallstreetbets,"Counterpoint: them being the current legal market leader is likely a *weakness.*

While DKNG engages in daily fantasy, which other major books don't, I'd argue that for most serious bettors, apps like betMGM which come with an extremely well known betting brand.

DKNG will need to up it's tech investment, e.g. by committing to being a partner or owner of FuboTV (bringing DKNG's sizeable existing audience to FUBO's unique value prop), or risk losing edge. (MGM for example has captured Yahoo as a partner, which has a significant Fantasy Sports presence).

[This article](https://www.legalsportsreport.com/45871/us-sports-betting-race-for-third/) while acknowledging the lead for DKNG, has a lot of information suggesting that there's going to be further division of the online sports betting market.

&nbsp;

That said, given that legalization is spreading, the entire market is going to grow by so much, higher price targets across the board for all involved major players is probably a viable option.

Less bullish than you but I've convinced myself while writing this that DKNG is probably undervalued in the long run due to the expanding addressable market."

2021-05-22 21:03:27,wallstreetbets,"Draft Kings customer service is top notch. Fan Duel on the other hand is crap. Fan Duel accused me of having 2 accounts, took the money from my account and closed it. They stated that I was scamming for an advantage by playing 2 accounts. Turns out another person with same name was playing there also. Didn't check location or other info just shut me down. Will not ever deposit with Fan Duel again. They would not listen to any reason or common sense. I am not the only person this has happened to. I have never had a bad experience with Draft Kings customer service. Any issue I have had, maybe 2 in 10 years were settled fairly and honestly. I'm not a big player but they respond like they want my business."

Second, I want to comment about the Dish rumors.  It will happen, Stanton Dodge (Chief Legal Officer of DraftKings) was Ergen's cheif  legal counsel at Dish for 21 years (linkedin is your freind).  This two are thick as theives. 

 Stanton's legal career  in CO is legendary with rumors dating back to Stanton sleeping in his car in the Dish parking lot when he started as an intern and who rose through the ranks to be Charlie Ergen's right hand legal guy.  All the Dish attorney's worked for him; so both companies have key relationships to strike a deal.   I'm very bullish on a deal being made,  and a big one at that.  

Tldr: Agreed. $50c is easy money"

2021-05-22 21:06:46,wallstreetbets,"Share offering killed the momentum last October and stock price has never hit $60 again. Rookie move at below market price because they were desperate for cash. Bad Bet - pun intended. 

Say what you want about Barstool but they own their customers already and we watched their shares run from$8 to $120.  Today at $77 they have plenty of room to run back up and you can’t pay enough for Portnoy’s influence with his coveted and valuable demographic base. Customer acquisition costs are expensive but when they sell shares at less than market, you lose investors trust and it’s far more expensive to get them back. Cramer is always pushing DKNG but he is hated right now because of his anti - GME and AmC opinions. Oh yes, he rarely reminds us he has a “relationship “ with DKNG. He should state that publicly EVERY time he is pushing the company but he doesn’t, which breeds mistrust.  

Also paying your board members in $$$ — how lame is that? Pay them in shares ....yeah, new game in town. Ask Ryan Cohen about that.

Jason Robins suffers from the Peter Principle. Sorry, but he does not have the corporate or educational background to grow a company of this size in new political markets like California, Florida, or NY. Heck, he can’t even influence his own state Massachusetts to pass online gambling. His only answer is spend cash and hire far too many employees for an online business. There are far better CEOs that can manage Wall Street, Las Vegas and connect with customers. He is a deer in headlights, amazed at his own success from his humble beginning at Vistaprint. Time to step it up and bring in real influencers that can do more than sign checks to get market exposure. They will bleed him dry. One bad quarter and crash back to $20 and shareholder lawsuits.  I am out ! 

Go hire a “proven performer“ to get this company to the next level. They have stalled out and fortunately many investors jumped ship to ride the cash train of Penn. Paying Barron’s, CNBC, and WSJ for favorable PR stories is old school .....it’s a new game guys - time to step it up."

edit: for anyone confused, that quoted statement is something called an emotional statement. Based on literally nothing besides the fact that Disney is a company that once made content people liked and is now hanging on through their failures, supported ONLY by Marvel and Star Wars. Look up their last three years and tell me how without Star Wars and Marvel they'd even exist anymore. Had Disney not bought both of those IPs, OP wouldn't even be bringing them up. Writing is on the walls for both of those IPs too now that they've milked it and gave up probably 70% of the actual fan bases of those IPs to bring ""woke"" and ""progressive"" ideals to people who either literally never asked for it or make up less than 10% of the population.   


Disney parks are failing, their media endeavors outside of news are starting to falter, Disney isn't shit anymore and when it folds up it'll happen overnight and no one will even hear the whimper. Political/social climate is beginning to shift in America for sure, with more and more people fed the fuck up of this vanilla milquetoast climate. People are going to start rebelling against these companies in another two or three years when it becomes punk to ""actually resist"" again lol. Disney is going to be among the first on the chopping block. Tell the bot to remind you of this post in three years and we'll talk about it then."

The real competition here comes from places like FOX and other major media companies who are already buying naming rights and individual stadium owners like Jerry Jones of the Cowboys, as betting is legalized and integrated into both in person live events and on live viewing. Companies like YouTube streaming and unknown online steamers could also compete for live online betting rights.

I'm not trying to talk anyone out of DK, I think they're both solid picks.  But as an *actual* gambler, I'm a lot more excited about MGMs product offerings."
2021-05-23 16:29:27,wallstreetbets,"Fully agree with your points. Overall sports betting/igaming sector will grow rapidly over the next 5 years. Pretty much all of them are good plays, some better than others. Dkng at 18b has less room to run than a PENN, SEAH, GENI, GNOG, RSI, GAN, etc. imo.

They’re desperate for cash because them and Fanduel are the only big companies throwing money to push legislators in states to legalize- ex: just last Monday, only Fanduel and DKNG had reps in the sports betting hearing in FL. They’re dumping money into this. 

Don’t get me wrong, Barstool has a great market reach with their platform and users, but at the end of the day, we’re comparing Toyota’s to Cadillac’s. Portnoy is a great spokesman, and good market guy, but that’s not enough to get PENN a deal with the NFL or ESPN. They’ll always have what they started with, the limited market that is 18-26 year old stoolies. 

It’s funny you brining Massachusetts in to this, but I don’t seem Portnoy bringing gambling to Massachusetts anytime, and that’s his hometown, aint it?

From the computers used in admissions to the sutures used in surgeries, chlorine is a vital part of hospital operations and patient treatments. In fact, probably no other institution relies as much on chlorine as hospitals. Hospital pharmacies are full of medications that rely on chlorine chemistry. Today, about 85 percent of all pharmaceuticals contain or are made using chlorine, including medications that treat heart disease, hypertension, cancer, AIDS, arthritis, pneumonia, depression, diabetes, allergies, meningitis, glaucoma, osteoporosis and ulcers.

Acetaminophen, the most widely used pain reliever in hospitals, is made with chlorine. Sodium chloride is also used in every COVID vaccine.

Chlorine and Medical Equipment

Chlorine is essential to a wide variety of hospital equipment. An estimated 25 percent of all medical devices in hospitals are made using chlorine, including some of the most widely used equipment:

· IV and blood bags. Chlorine-based plastics are used to make the millions of blood and IV bags used by hospitals and blood banks each year. 

 

* Sterile tubing       and packaging. Chlorine-based plastics are also used to make these       essential devices.  

Premier Infection-Fighter

Chlorine compounds are used widely to maintain hospital cleanliness and prevent thousands of life-threatening infections. As a bleach and medicinal aid, chlorine compounds:

· Prevent bacterial contamination of patients' burns and wounds

· Disinfect kidney dialysis machines

· Clean and disinfect work surfaces and equipment in medical laboratories

· Kill deadly bacteria, such as Legionnaire's Disease, that can live in hospital water and air conditioning systems.

Chlorine in the Operating Room

Chlorine plays a number of critical roles in the operating room:

· *Anesthesia.* Anesthetics, such as Anactine Flopak, are made with chlorine.  
 General cleaning and disinfection. Infections are a significant threat in hospitals. Chlorine-based cleansers disinfect work surfaces and equipment.

· *Sutures and other surgical equipment.* Chlorine helps make nylon, an essential material in surgical sutures, artificial blood vessels and osmotic membranes. And vinyl, a chlorine-based plastic, is used in heart catheters.

 

* *Electronic       instruments.* Computers       and electronic devices play an increasingly important role in the       operating room and hospital patient care, and chlorine provides one of       the crucial building blocks in the manufacture of semiconductors used in       these life-saving electronic instruments.”

It’s obvious that chlorine plays an irreplaceable role in healthcare and the safety of our healthcare workers, and safety has never been more crucial than during COVID. It is my belief that to ensure safety for healthcare workers and availability of chlorine dependent products used in healthcare, Biden used the Defense Production Act to require companies that produce critical chlor alkali raw materials to prioritize production for the healthcare industry and combatting COVID.

[The Defense Production Act and the Biden Administration – Publications | Morgan Lewis](https://www.morganlewis.com/pubs/2021/02/insight-the-defense-production-act-and-the-biden-administration-first100) 

### BIDEN ADMINISTRATION’S EXPECTED USE OF THE DPA

&#x200B;

* The      Biden administration has publicly stated that it intends to use the DPA to      combat the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, the administration is likely      to use the DPA to accelerate COVID-19-related supply chains.
* The      administration has identified 12 categories of critical supplies that will      accelerate the manufacture, delivery, and administration of COVID-19      vaccines.
* The      six vaccine candidates being developed as part of Operation Warp Speed, as      well as companies manufacturing COVID-19 therapeutics, have priority DPA      ratings.
* On      January 21, 2021, President Joe Biden signed an executive order that      directs federal agencies to use all available legal authorities, including      the DPA, to fill supply shortfalls that are critical to the COVID-19      pandemic response.

With chlor alkali producers being forced to prioritize chlorine based raw material production for the healthcare industry and COVID pandemic, all other industries dependent on chlor alkali have been left behind to experience a complete lack of the same raw materials. The impacts are detailed below.

The computer chip shortage is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here’s how: [Trichlorosilane: Cornerstone Chemical for Electronics and High-Tech Toys (americanchemistry.com)](https://chlorine.americanchemistry.com/Science-Center/Chlorine-Compound-of-the-Month-Library/Trichlorosilane-Cornerstone-Chemical-for-Electronics-and-High-Tech-Toys/)

Silicon chlorides are some of the cornerstone chemicals of the Information Age. Trichlorosilane (HSiCl3) is an intermediate compound used to produce extremely pure silicon, from which computer chips, the ""brains"" of electronic devices and high-tech toys, are manufactured. The famous high-tech industrial area of California, Silicon Valley, was named for the chemical element that has revolutionized the way we communicate and play. And chlorine has played an essential role in the high-tech revolution.

The aluminum shortage is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here’s how:  [Aluminum Chloride | Aluminum Sulfate | Aluminum Manufacturers](https://www.aluminummanufacturers.org/aluminum-sulfate/aluminum-chloride/) – Chlorine based chemical used primarily in the production of aluminum metal. Chlorine is also used in the recycling of aluminum. 

The plastic shortage, especially PVC (polyvinyl chloride) is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here’s how: [Polymer Raw Material Shortage for 90% of Converters (plasticsconverters.eu)](https://www.plasticsconverters.eu/post/polymer-raw-material-shortage-for-90-of-converters) 

According to **EuPC Managing Director Alexandre Dangis***, “Manufacturers of plastic products all over Europe are experiencing serious bottlenecks in the supply of raw materials since the beginning of this year. Delivery problems have become increasingly widespread, affecting raw materials for example (not limited) such as Polypropylene, Polyvinyl Chloride, and Polyethylene, as well as special additives that are crucial for the manufacture of compounds and plastic products. The serious market disruptions currently taking place all over Europe are a symptom of the structural imbalance in Europe between the local production of and demand for raw materials and additives. Without restoration of that balance, periodic recurrence of gross disruption of the production chain is highly likely.*

*All of the 3 raw materials mentioned above are chlorine based.* 

The cat food shortage is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here’s how:   [Functions and Requirements of Chlorine in Cats | Pet Care Advisors](https://petcareadvisors.com/cats/functions-and-requirements-of-chlorine-in-cats/) – Chlorine is used in cat food as they are highly attracted to it. 

The chicken shortage is being caused by the chlorine shortage. Here’s how:    [Chlorinated chicken explained: why do the Americans treat their poultry with chlorine? | Analysis & Features | The Grocer](https://www.thegrocer.co.uk/food-safety/chlorinated-chicken-explained-why-do-the-americans-treat-their-poultry-with-chlorine/555618.article) – The US Poultry Industry chlorinates chicken as a part of the disinfection process. 

This dependency on chlor alkali to fight COVID isn’t just happening in America. Below are links to numerous countries around the globe using chlorine and chlorine based products heavily to fight COVID.

With this information, it is my belief that chlor alkali manufacturers will continue to experience overwhelming demand nearly impossible to satisfy for the next 2 years plus. This demand will of course create record breaking revenues and profit margins for the industry. As the largest chlor alkali producer in the world, Olin Corporation (ticker symbol $OLN) is in perfect position to reap the most reward. I am highly confident that gross revenue / net profits will significantly exceed expectations for all of 2021, 2022 and likely 2023.

2021-05-22 23:53:12,wallstreetbets,At least sell your options when they spike on Monday.
2021-05-22 22:16:22,wallstreetbets,Great opportunity and barring any huge setbacks it certainly seems like a great entry point for your shares. I’m thinking I might sell off three of the contracts this week and hold the other two for a few more weeks. If it truly moons I might have to exercise and hold a few hundred shares myself. Good Luck 🍀

2021-05-23 14:00:26,wallstreetbets,The call may have worked out but I know multiple data scientists who have worked with C3AI and I have only heard bad things from them. This makes me concerned about their long term prospects.
2021-05-22 21:01:09,wallstreetbets,When did you buy these and why?
2021-05-22 23:03:22,wallstreetbets,Lol the company I work at owns a large portion of C3AI before they IPO’d recently. That shit has been tanking ever since.

2021-05-22 20:41:26,wallstreetbets,We’ll see what share lock up does to the selling pressure.
2021-05-22 21:38:22,wallstreetbets,Yah unless it reaches 90+ before . Lockup is a non event though as most insiders were able to sell earlier ( there was a clause in the IPO which allowed them to sell if stock price reached 30% higher than IPO price ) .
2021-05-22 20:01:17,wallstreetbets,"It's still a Bullshit stock. Luck is no excuse from a trade with horrible risk/reward potential. It changed its from C3 Energy (its actual primary focus still) to C3 IoT (hype theme few years ago) to C3.ai (hype them today). That should tell you everything about the company and the management. It's a promotion stock just like Nikola - there is no convincing technology beind it. 
It has 3 primary customer - all of them are energy companies with terrible balance sheets.
It has a EV/Ebitda of 30 (!) and P/S of 28 while only growing 20% in the long-term. In addition the stock is very risk-sensitive. It's going to get crushed under inflation. 
If you want to buy a 20% growth stock, you should witch to Facebook, Alphabet, Amazon etc. They have at least moats and pricing power.
I'm interest to hear your thoughts about the company.
But Im interested in hearing your thesis. I don't have a monopoly on knowledge. Congratulations and fuck you. Thanks."
2021-05-23 15:12:33,wallstreetbets,"The context of the negative things I have heard were with respect to the development of new models for joint efforts with C3. The comment did not apply to existing models that you may be able to directly apply as is to your problems. Perhaps those are good but I can't comment on those either way. My understanding is that in order to develop new models you have to use their proprietary language so if you ever want to stop using C3AI then you effectively loose everything you had worked on and you cannot bring in previously developed models to speed up development. These views were not expressed from a friend of a friend but rather from multiple coworkers who got trained to develop on C3AI's platform for the purpose of reviewing it for joint development efforts. This information was directed to me because I am also an ML developer. Overall, I would characterize the review as scathing, but the information above is all I am comfortable giving. 

If you have information about why you are impressed by the models I would like to hear it. My views on C3 are open to changing as there may be more reasons to work with them now than when we reviewed it."

2021-05-23 15:51:49,wallstreetbets,Ok I’m not a perma bull anyway - as mentioned in my DD I shorted this when it was above 120 . Good for a short term ride up as it was oversold .

2021-05-23 17:02:47,wallstreetbets,2009 is boomer for a tech company. Technically it was founded before then but Siebel “re-founded” it with his investment. And they have struggled this whole time to get something useful to market. None of their current customers have “ai”. They just have analytics: glorified excel. Their talk is not backed by their walk and their customer market knows it.
2021-05-23 19:08:20,wallstreetbets,I get it.  It's a joke.  Everybody is a moron around here.
2021-05-23 00:16:48,wallstreetbets,"You are both right but the difference is when fundamentals start to matter, it'll be the retards killing themselves. No different from 2008."
2021-05-23 05:23:55,wallstreetbets,"And you think this is a state that will maintain forever? Look what happened recently. Some of your mentioned factors started to reverse and all your favorite hype and momentum stocks are down 50% from their February highs. Have you been trading this year? The market is focusing on the best stocks with the strongest fundamentals now because the FAANGs are barely dipping. Why should C3 reach its old highs or even 100 USD only because the Fed goes bbrrrrrr? I would buy the best companies and leverage those.
But in the end I'm just a retard like you"
2021-05-23 15:58:02,wallstreetbets,Yep my comment is really only relevant to the long term business and probably has no impact on any short term movements.

2021-05-23 16:01:41,wallstreetbets,Make sense . I would write a post or a review of their tools and models at some point . I don’t see myself invested in long term though - like PLTR better as a long term play .
2021-05-23 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"UWMC ex DIV 6/9??? A Match Made in Heaven UWMC has gone up 25% in a week and its still undervalued and over shorted based purely on my autistic beliefs.

EX dividend is literally 6/9 do you need to know anything else? This was made for WSB.

EDIT: I guess I have to do some real DD so automod doesn't ban me. Nobody reads that shit anyways.

Reasons this fucker is going to the moon:

1. They are the top mortgage lender... If you listened to their earnings call it was much different than RKT's. While RKT saw margins damper and guided down for the future, UWMC actually had a completely different tone. Margins were practically unaffected and they probably couldn't have given better guidance. TLDR: Rates go up we dominate competition and market share. Rates stay at these levels we continue to have massive revenues and return that money to the shareholders.
2. Next reason, they actually return money to shareholders! First year on the market and they already pay a dividend and have a massive share repurchase program in the works.
3. Now onto that share buyback program. They announced $300m of share repurchases.... for context when they announced that the entire float was worth $600m... you can see how this might affect price.
4. This company is making nearly 900m a quarter of NET INCOME and is priced at $12b... Show me where else you can find this in this market.
5. As you've already heard a million times by others Wall St is shorting the shit out of this thing for no apparent reason and you best believe they are doubling down after that run up and the recent fed comments on decreased house sales.

TLDR. UWMC going to the moon.... Way over shorted way under priced worst case scenario you are holding something that pays you every quarter and has a track record that lasts decades.

POSITIONS: ROLLED 7.50 calls to 6/18. have about 5 8/20 $6 calls and a shit ton of shares that are paying me every quarter

EDIT: Retards dividends aren't just important for that 10 cents. Stocks like to pump into ex dividend as boomers get interested and pay 50 cents more for a 10 cent dividend. Also I've heard talks of some guy named Russel being interested in the stock, does anyone know if he has a reddit?"
2021-05-22 23:03:49,wallstreetbets,"Also being added to MSCI small cap on May 27th and expected be added to Russell 2000 in the next two weeks I believe. Each fund will likely add about a million shares, maybe a bit more. They will likely be buying in the coming weeks before dividend. Will add a little buying pressure."
2021-05-22 20:39:53,wallstreetbets,"With a risky and overvalued market right now and inflation looming. This is about the safest bet, short of just holding cash."
2021-05-22 22:23:30,wallstreetbets,Shouldn’t this stock be worth minimum $10?
2021-05-22 23:28:22,wallstreetbets,Not to forget possible Russell inclusion

2021-05-22 20:37:19,wallstreetbets,I believe the purpose of the buyback program is to reward investors by increasing the share price and to attract more investors by building confidence that the investment will go up in value.  They don't need to spend all the money allocated.  It's there to stabilize and increase share price.
2021-05-22 23:56:01,wallstreetbets,"There will be some profit taking, though I think most who were in it for a quick buck already sold.  I know a few who sold at $8.50ish and bought back in the low $8s.  They see where this is going"

Although this is a biased take - but many brokers have chosen to go with UWMC as of recent because they wouldnt allow their clients to work with RKT.

From what ive heard UWM is a great broker and many people love to work with them for a variety of reasons - you can google about them. Most mortgages touch their hands at one point."
2021-05-23 18:38:37,wallstreetbets,"They take a smaller margin than others, making it up in volume.  High rates make them look better compared to the competition."

2021-05-23 15:36:04,wallstreetbets,He definitely needs his own post thats insane. I would say extreme autism but honestly I dont even think its autistic at this point with the price so low - a fellow autist
2021-05-22 20:10:41,wallstreetbets,"Yeah.  Everyone is so short sighted anymore.  They think all stocks should moon the next day. They would rather have a big hit once instead of utilize the power of compounded returns. You always want a company to buy back as low as possible for 2 reasons....1. They take more shares off the market making yours more valuable,  and 2. You would question management's use of capital if they used free cash flow to purchase their own stock at a premium multiplier. They could better utilize that money to help their business if it's high."
2021-05-22 20:44:36,wallstreetbets,"Generally they allocate a dollar amount.  You want them to get as many shares back for that dollar.... and if it wasn't a specified dollar, but a share amount.....  as a shareholder you want the company to spend as few of the dollars as possible then to leave more free cash flow and working capital.  End of the day,  it's always best long term if a company buys the shares back at the lowest price possible. If the price skyrockets during a buyback,  it only compromises the value of that buyback."
2021-05-23 10:44:26,wallstreetbets,Exercise before 6/9 sell after 6/9 you must have shares by end of 6/9 to get the dividend

2021-05-22 21:01:07,wallstreetbets,"If the price were to skyrocket, they can just reserve their buying power until the price comes down again.  The sole purpose of the buyback is to provide support and steady growth to the share price.  It's not to try to buy as many shares as possible.  They actually are trying to avoid buying too many because they know the float is already small."

2021-05-22 21:05:02,wallstreetbets,"Dude, you're just not getting it.  We all get the purpose of the buyback. This post has nothing to do with the companies motive. The company isn't aiming to buy them cheap,  they're just allocating funds over a period of time to perform it for their shareholders regardless of price. The price staying low is completely just where you as a shareholder should hope for.... take it from someone who knows,  and if you don't trust me,  trust Warren buffet on this.  It's best for the shareholders if it underperforms during a buyback.  Period,  end of story.  No debate."
2021-05-22 21:19:47,wallstreetbets,"Haha alright man, take it easy.  I agree you will end up owning slightly more of the company in the long run, but personally I'd like to see my investment go up over the next 6 months.

Edit: otherwise, why not just buy 6 months from now if the price stays the same"
2021-05-22 21:31:32,wallstreetbets,"The bottom line is, this magical bean is going with or without me I choose to ride the train.

It doesnt matter what I want or you want Its heavily shorted with lots of volume coming in... we've seen this story before. I like the short term tendies that come from a squeeze while also having faith in the company and for them to make good decesions with where they buy shares.

If you are a ""long term"" investor the $300m buyback barely matters to a company that makes much more every quarter. 20 years later there will have been plenty of buybacks and offerings."
2021-05-23 18:32:43,wallstreetbets,"Because the shorts could decide to cover and everyone else could decide that it's a safe bet and it's up to 10 or 11 before you know it.

2021-05-22 21:26:12,wallstreetbets,"The stock dropped as soon as the announcement came out.  Pretty hilarious. they are losing shows and movies to other apps, their few decent proprietary shows are released annually and only 8-10 epispdes a pop. the platform is running on fumes; diversifying into gaming just seems desperate"

It’s a saturated market and their competition are starting to build better content and releasing over the year to keep those subs. Netflix do the same but will end shows after 2 seasons and leave an unsatisfying gap in their catalogue.

Diverting resources to gaming, where there’s even bigger fish seems poorly conceived."

2021-05-23 09:30:36,wallstreetbets,"Lol ok, I get it you wouldn't download a car.  

Got another documentary last night legally,  the wallstreet conspiracy."
2021-05-23 10:14:27,wallstreetbets,"I mean not trying to be mean, but this is what sums up a boomer mentality. I’d rather pay someone for what I perceive at protection because I don’t want to spend literally an hour learning how to set this up. 

u/beefskeet (beautiful name also) is absolutely correct and everyone should switch to this. Honestly, you can take it a couple steps further and do a ton more. Just so people know, downloading/copying media only is a problem if you distribute it or make money somehow. So just like a DVR works, this is the same thing. The DVR is convenient because they just manage the Hard drive and hook it up to a service. 

Also $10/month? You getting one streaming service that doesn’t cover all the stuff you probably like? Their leasing agreements change? Like Netflix losing the office that time?"
2021-05-23 17:56:59,wallstreetbets,"Thats why I canceled my streaming accounts. I have like 3 shows i watch on different platforms.

But let's give it up for the ultimate media server, remote desktop. When truly desperate at work I used to remote into my home pc via vnc and watch videos like 5 fps from a Shockwave player it hosted of the desktop"
2021-05-23 10:55:44,wallstreetbets,"To set up your own media server to access content from anywhere might be an hour of work if you know how to do it. 


You need multiple TB of redundant storage accessible to the internet. You need to setup a user manage system. You need to manually copy each piece of content or set up a bot to do it for you. You need to then maintain the hardware and software. 


To insist that everyone ""spend literally an hour"" to do this isn't accurate.


Time is more valuable than money, I'd rather just pay $50 a month to watch or listen to whatever I want whenever I want and not think about it."
2021-05-23 14:25:45,wallstreetbets,"It really is though, Windows literally built this as part of the solution in its current release. If you have an Xbox or Windows machine, it’s so simple. If you have a Mac, Apple TV device can help make this all happen or you have a couple extra steps. 

Based on your logic also, $50/month is cheaper than spending the setup time. Sure, short term, but if you look a year down the line the setup would save you $600. Also you stop losing transitional time from commercials. 

I’m just saying it’s way easier than you think it is. If you’ve ever visited 192.168.1.1 to change router settings, then you’re fully capable of doing this."
2021-05-23 11:20:33,wallstreetbets,"My man it can be as simple as right clicking the folder and hitting the share button for you windows users. 3 seconds.

Then mount that directory from another pc on the LAN and use the contents as if they were local. That is a basic media server. Hit windows key + r on the client pc, then type \ \directory\ theres your playlist.

If you really want a URL to stream to, get a dyndns or something to update your dns to a dynamic IP. used to be free. I have about 500gb in use on mine, and an external with everything I don't need on it now.

So 20 minutes tops if you're not retarded  to stream to oooh, your car flatscreen from home. Put a jumper in that brake detector wire and you're solid for video stream 👌

If you think GameStop’s business model is based on traded in and rented games, you may have them confused with blockbuster, and are certainly unclear on their digital pivot. The stock isn’t worth “$150” because we’re swapping cartridges with them. The stock is worth more than current valuation because of a wide variety of reasons based in fundamentals, and even more reasons based on illegal and manipulative practices in the market, that GME and a host of other companies have fallen prey to. I’m sure you can find plenty of reading material on this sub and others, good luck in your ventures, see you from the moon 🌚"

You likely are unclear of their digital pivot, since you have to ask. I am a stickler of a customer and they've developed quite a customer base and when you combine that with all the free advertising and shift in logistics - $$$$."

Or you can adapt or pivot to overcome your perceived disadvantage in terms of valuation. 

So piss on your generic talk of deep value propaganda. Show me the value in terms of actual fucking human value."

2021-05-22 22:21:35,wallstreetbets,"Yes I do support it, and so will my kids. Listen maybe we got off on the wrong foot. I grew up with the OG ninento, before that I had the commodore 64. My point is I go back, and so do my friends. I'm a computer science major, gamer, investor. So when my friends and I are talking about video games (for our whole lives) we talk about the future. and its typically about the industry having to change from console and cartridges to subscription based online content. The retail location to buy sell and trade consoles (just like a blockbuster) will die. But guess what? Blockbuster showed the world what happens when you let a redbox and netflix come in for your tendies. You die, quick and hard. 

So why will Gamestop survive? I haven't seen this analogy so forgive me if it's not constructed correctly as I'm doing this freehand... just ask Nintendo. 

Nintendo owned the video game landscape before playstation came in and then xbox afterwards (don't forget NeoGeo in there along with others). Everyone always thought Nintendo would eventually fall out, but look at. their history. They'll come out with Pokemon Go and their stock goes bananas. They come out with switch and they can't keep them in stock. 

My point is that Nintendo has a brand, a great upper mgmt, great vision and cult level customer base.

Gamestop has a brand, a great upper mgmt and cult level customer base. 

I am not ready to say that Gamestop has great vision, but I think that will come out after the annual meeting when RC takes the reigns and can fully enact his directive. But because of his history at Chewy I'd have to say that great vision is at least implied. They at least have a great visionary. 

Thanks for the opportunity to put my thoughts down."

Rocket, which went public in August 2020, reported on May 5, 2021 that the Company’s volume of closed loan originations fell in the first quarter from the fourth quarter and that the weakness would continue in the second quarter of 2021. Following the news, Rocket’s stock price tumbled, falling over 16% on May 6, 2021.

Problem is, we are all laughing at them, cause after they knocked all of them down, we bought more and kept laughing at those idiots. 

Now we are in this predicament where 30+ stocks have 25%+ of total float shorted and no ones selling and the rate to borrow is growing to 20%-70% interest depending on where you research the numbers.

2021-05-23 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$SPCE TA - Broke Out Of A Major Setup Friday - To The Moon! We all know about the successful flight and everyone is expecting some moonage next week - so I just wanted to provide some **unbiased** TA. Keep in mind technicals are not a crystal ball, they are a **road map.** I do not hold a position *(although if I looked at the chart Friday, I would).*

[$SPCE 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/c32m1rk5eq071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d477968e5afc2875bca36a471e1c77bd84adcbd)

Here you can see we **broke out of a large descending wedge on Friday** (with fantastic volume). This is the same pattern damn near every speculative growth stock has been caught in for the past few months. Normally it has a bearish bias - because it is coming from downside. However, in this scenario - **it broke up -** which means **we can see some fantastic follow through to the upside.**

The price targets for this setup would be **22.61, 26.18, 28.05, 29.71.** These are all resistances - and in a normal situation you would either trim as we run into these, or scale in as we clear them.

However - given the news catalyst - it's hard to say how high we will gap up on Monday. Above that last level is **34.84** and **36.63.** It's unlikely we cross these without an insane short squeeze, or another pattern forming (at least on the shorter term charts).

Remember, each time we clear one of these levels on a **daily close -** it will become a support. As a result, you can trail your stop loss below them as we continue.

This is one of many examples of **""technicals precede news""** I have encountered throughout my trading career - and one of the reasons I try to ignore anything except for the charts while I am trading. It's hard to quantify arbitrary events - and especially hard to do so without bias. Thankfully, we will often **break out of a major pattern prior to a news release -** like you see here.

I'll be looking to day trade this stock next week depending where we open.

***TL;DR*** \- $SPCE broke out Friday & has positive news to help it along next week

Price targets are **22.61, 26.18, 28.05, 29.71**

*Not Financial Advice*

EDIT: Rejected off of 26.18 and going for the gap fill - re-entry would be on a daily close above that level. After a gap fill you want to see something take out the previous high."

2021-05-23 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Technical Analysis on Smoothed Moving Average (SMMA) indicator in the context of SPY day trading Some people very proudly draw some lines and then claim something like-

 

* **Current support at 60 SMMA**
* **Current resistance at 20 SMMA**

When asked the detail they reply by some evasive way. Let's look at the a very widely mentioned TA indicator know as Smoothed Moving Average (SMMA). Note that depending on the trading platform it might have different name. Here is a 1-day chart with moving average indicators for 20-day and 60-day below. The frequency of the data points are set at 1 minute.

 

[May 21, 2021 SPY daily chart \(1-min frequency\) with 20-day and 60-day SMMA indicators ](https://preview.redd.it/9pgrbjn05q071.jpg?width=1915&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f791febda72367d086560c590f33d3b80556d5b2)

The blue line is indicating 20-day SMMA and the orange line is 60-day. I drew some lines to show short term trend by pink and cyan colors. If you look at the price action around the pink straight lines you see that SPY is below both lines that means none of the 60-day or 20-day SMMA is acting as support here. Now if you believe in these indicators and bought 0 DTE FD calls as a hope that 60-day SMMA will save you, you know what would happen. Or it might happens a lot and that's why these TA guys never post their gains along with time of buy and sell orders.

Now they might say, well 1-min will not work do it for 15 minutes or even 5 minutes. Let's see exactly the same SPY daily chart with 5-minutes frequency below-

 

[May 21, 2021 SPY daily chart \(5-min frequency\) with 20-day and 60-day SMMA indicators](https://preview.redd.it/pd26lwg97q071.jpg?width=1918&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e299624911f1199dbee4b691009c364d321ed77b)

Exactly the same chart with only difference is number of data points, which is smaller due to 5 minutes time interval. Now please tell me which SMMA is acting as as support and which one as a resistance here? 60-day SMMA is definitely not a support because SPY was below that line half of the trading hours. 20-day SMMA is not a resistance because SPY was above that line for almost one third of the market hour.   

Now look at the same chart with 15-minutes time interval below-



[May 21, 2021 SPY daily chart \(15-min frequency\) with 20-day and 60-day SMMA indicators](https://preview.redd.it/61y5xgro9q071.jpg?width=1919&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3b56255ee6192d2d42892a89ef86ff3745f9b804)

Tell me what is support or resistance here? At what price point would you buy calls or puts and where would you exit?

They might say you need to look at the RSI, MACD, BBW, CMO, CCI, KB, EMA, CADO, DSS, spotgamma, venna, chart etc. you know that they have no idea what they are talking. 

Discard these all indicators, if you just play around with the daily, 2-day, 5-day, weekly, 10-day, monthly timeframe with 1-min, 5-min, 10-min, 30-min frequency, you end up with over 20 different looking charts where if you plot just a single indicator it will be different in all those chart. 

**TA guy come here and tell me which chart should someone use for trading FDs or weeklies? daily, 2-day, 5-day, weekly, monthly? At what frequency of data points? Which indicators? What is the success rate? Over what time period that success rate is calculated?** 

# Let me tell you my success rate here. I initiated and closed 19 weeklies and FDs last week and I made money from 17, broke even on 1 and lost on 1. That's 89% success rate without any TA.

2021-05-22 20:32:55,wallstreetbets,"I like that you at least tried to answer something. However someone need more information. Let me simplify this way. I want to scalp options either 0 DTE or 1 DTE. Now questions-

1. Which chart? Daily or weekly or something in between or monthly?
2. 15, 30, 1 and 4 that's 4 different chart. Which one and what determines which one? Also, at 10:00 am or at 11:00 am you do not really have a 1 or 4 hour chart respectively. Also, which MA? 20? 60? 100? 200? See there are length of time your plot is showing data, there are frequency, there are variation in MA settings. None of the books I read says anything about the anything definitely. You can use a 20-day or a 60-day or a 100-day to find support or resistance. That's a hell lot of combinations. If you tell people these are the options you have and now try and see which one works for you, it's not a good advice. Because one day one set up may hit but there is no guaranty that will hit gain on the same stock next day or next month or another stock. That's the problem with TA.  
3. 1,5 minutes to time exit. So are you holding for 1 to 5 minutes? What if SP doesn't move much in that time frame? What if you are in loss but not big enough to hit stop loss trigger? What if you are at loss only 5% after entering the position and SP moves slowly but under your entry point for 2 hours and theta is burning? In that kind of situation your MA will not move much."

If youre successfully trading then i guess why change now. But by disparaging a tool that is quite useful for many other traders just seems short sighted. Glad u made money rhis week tho bro. Amd JJD is a boss dont come at him xuz his style differs from yours. If you notice in his TA he gives a bullish amd a bearish pt. Cuz the market really can go either way."
2021-05-22 20:48:45,wallstreetbets,"1. Its whatever trading view defaults to as far as a 5m 1d or 5m 5d idk. On ToS which I don’t use as much it’s usually 1m 1d 5m 5d. 

2. The 15m on up usually default to at least 5d of info on most platforms. In my style I use the MAs along with support resistance lines I draw or fib lines. If it crosses over a line and a ma is coming up fast, I’ll bail off I got my minimum PT or start to trim. Reverse with SL. It also helps to be tracking volume and obv or BBS or whatever else they can start to give an indication of momentum slowing. 

0DTE are extremely tricky and no one I know has a provable high success rate with them. 1dte atm are a bit easier if you can catch the low/high of the day since you have another day for it you to be right and have to little time cushion yet. 

But yes everyday you should update your chart to account for the prior days price action if day trading. Longer term you don’t need to as often, especially if it’s just trading sideways or there’s a big move. 

3. Holds times depend on market actions and price movement. Options I’ll hold for as little as 5 min some times on stuff like tsla, but indexes or say AMD might take a few hours. Once I’m in though is back to 1. and following the action. 

Everyday is different and no strategy works everyday all the time. Need to have a few different set ups with different indicators and ta lines ready imo. In trading view I have 4 different set ups saved and updated my main trading stocks at least weekly. That way I have options ready to go no matter what the market is doing"

Did I claim That was a consistent results I have been getting? I did not.

Did I say I have a proven strategy that works? I did not. 

The whole point of refereeing that last week gain was to point the random nature of stock market as a whole. Sometimes you make profit and sometimes you lose. There is no strategy for consistence profit in trading. Most day traders lose money despite using TA tools.

2021-05-22 21:39:09,wallstreetbets,"See the thing is human like pattern. The reason is deeply rooted in our successful survival and becoming at the top of the food chain. A pattern that our brain can relate to something familiar so that we know beforehand whether it's safe or danger. 

Now, ""It doesn't always work"" point. If I give you a stock chart let's say a 3 months chart of SPY. You can create at least 30 different charts from that same chart just buy changing the parameters such as duration, frequency of the SP and indicators as well. They all will look different.

Now from that 30 different chart you can find pattern like X-day SMMA is acting as support and Y-day SMMA is acting as resistance in a few charts. But in other chart you will see that those support and resistance lines are not acting as support and resistance at all.

Now if you create the same 30 charts using a different ETF or stocks, you might find that pattern in some chart and not in majority of otherers. 

One configuration in one chart of that SPY that shows the support and resistance is no longer valid in other ETF or stocks. 

Now if you take a 6 months chart and redo everything you will get even more random hit and miss. 

Stock or ETF or whatever the financial instruments doesn't obey or follow a predefined line such as a moving average line. The movement is inherently random but could take a directional move based on many many factors that no one in this earth has control over. Now, if you do not have control over something in a short term you can not really predict the movement with any confidence at all.

You can make speculative guess based on surrounding economic, political, weather, company financial, earning reports etc. but that speculation is not for day trading. 

You can observe RSI and might think that well it's over bought and then you buy puts only to see that SP keeps going u. SP might drop slightly gradually and RSI might go down to 30 but it could still be a price above your entry. Which means your puts are not doing well.

2021-05-23 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"tired of people posting non-log charts to show we're in a bubble TLDR; use log scale on your charts before posting about bubbles

Use a logarithmic scale and you will see the market is growing at the rate it has been growing most of the time. Or at least the currency it's getting debased, whatever. So no, the charts don't show a bubble. Now if there is some hidden stuff like CDOs in 2008 happening somewhere else, we are going to find out when it happens, before that, no one knows shit.

edit: the market suffered a prolonged drawdown in 1920s to 1940s, but you see the market recovered fast after 1920s massacre, I put my money down that the recovery stalled in the 40s because someone (I think called hitler) was killing jews for sport in europe and the japanese captured the American colony of Philippines and some shit. So yeah, unless there is a WWIII I don't suspect there will be another 20-30 year long drawdown. In which case, I don't give a shit about stocks.

Edit 2: my fellow apes, just to be very very clear. I don't claim there won't be a crash. All I'm saying is, non logged charts are not an indicator of it. There might be there might not be. I don't know! But there are other arguments to be made not poor charting!

2. Paid flight with [Italian Air Force](https://www.virgingalactic.com/articles/virgin-galactic-and-italian-air-force-announce-world-first-government-contract-for-human-tended-research-flight/) is still on the schedule for 2022
3. Sir Richard's maiden voyage will like now take place THIS YEAR, lowering the concerns for other eccentric billionaires to go for a joy ride
4. There are at least [8,000 flights](https://www.manufacturing.net/aerospace/news/21118425/virgin-galactic-8000-have-placed-space-flight-reservation) already reserved which equals at least $2B (8,000x 250,000) in locked in future revenue, and the assumption is that if commercial flights start in 2022, new bookings will start much higher up

2021-05-23 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Inflation – when the magic of money causes the death of money. We all have some basic idea of inflation—the rise in the price of goods over time. Inflation is a very, very old concept. It is an ancient concept almost as old as man himself. There has been nothing really new about inflation in the thousands of years of inflation’s history, and there still is not. Governments have been repeating the same mistake throughout history, sometimes leading to vicious cycles of hyperinflation. They have perpetually been rediscovering first the splendors and later the woes of inflation. Foolishly, each new government discovering this ” magic of money” seems to believe that no one has ever beheld such splendors before. The end result is always the same – the death of money.

Admittedly this is a long post, but we have to follow the thread of inflation throughout history to understand what is happening in the United States today. That is exactly what we will do. We will also look at one particular case where inflation never happened, the 2008 financial crisis. Later in the post, there is a comparison between what the Federal Reserve is doing today regarding the Covid-19 response stimulus package and the inflation trends throughout history. Finally, we will make our case why we believe that inflation is about to rise in the United States.

# In the beginning, was inflation

Money probably made its first appearance soon after the earliest caveman had his first successful hunt. Not long after he started hunting, he probably realized he could use animal skin as counters for trading spearheads and other goods with other cave dwellers. Anything like those animal skins with an accepted symbolic value, greater than its intrinsic value, was true money.

Because of human nature’s inherent yearning for more power and status, it probably did not take long for the smarter amongst the cavemen leaders to realize that controlling money was key to increasing his fortune. If he could decree what money was, then he could issue the money and gain political power. Not only that, but he could also benefit materially by exchanging money for things like spearheads and caves. We can speculate endlessly about what form the first money manifested in. It does not really matter. What is important is that the money manifested in a form that only the caveman leader could control. Probably something in the form of a specific animal’s skin that only he was allowed to hunt.

Along with a rising requirement for more caves and spearheads, the leader probably responded by hunting this exclusive animal more. As he hunted more, more animal skins became available, and the animal skins started losing their value as a means of trading. Undoubtedly, it did not take long for the price of spearheads and caves to rise in terms of animal skins. Buckled under the pressure of an oversupply of animal skin that was losing value, the subordinate cavemen experienced the first-ever inflation.

Not only was this the first example of inflation, but it was also the first example of government finance.

# Inflation through the ages

Man has evolved and progressed in many ways since the days we first left our caves. We landed on the moon and created the Higgs Boson collider. Yet, in contrast, there has been little progress in the area of inflation. In terms of inflation, there is nothing new under the sun. From the caveman beginnings to today, governments have perpetually rediscovered first the splendors and later inflation woes. This tragedy of the magic of money causing the death of money keeps on repeating itself in different forms. What follows here is a thread of inflation through history into the present day.

# The death of the Nummus (300 A.D)

&#x200B;

[Nummus Coins](https://preview.redd.it/0koiv421wp071.jpg?width=246&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1b9a4fe807e5cb8dd78f714f1897f66b8dd555be)

One of the most violent and earliest forms of inflation occurred around the year 300 A.D. Not only was it a violent affair in terms of killing money. It also caused the death of hundreds of Romans in the form of the death penalty.

Nummi was a Roman empire era government-issued coin. It was made of copper washed with silver. The material to manufacture this coin was abundant across the Roman empire and, as a result, cheap to manufacture. As a natural consequence, the Roman empire, under Emperor Diocletian, produced more and more coins.

As more and more Nummi coins were produced, the Nummi started losing value. The price of goods and services began to rise. In response to this, the Emperor introduced strict price control measures in the form of price ceilings. Violators of the stipulated price ceilings would receive the death penalty. After inflicting many death penalties, the situation still did not improve. There were just too many Nummi in circulation, rendering it worthless. At some point, ordinary Romans preferred trading in items ranging from clay pottery to stones and ornaments instead of the Nummi. It is not the first time in history we will see basic elements like clay carrying more value than money. During the 1920s hyperinflation in Germany, it was cheaper to use paper money for making fires instead of purchasing firewood.

The result? The death of the Nummi. Throughout history, we will see the same pattern emerge where the “magic” of inflation leads to the death of money.

# Inflation through the centuries

So it has gone throughout man’s recorded history. Man has known inflation for centuries. Babylon and Ancient China both recorded inflations. The kings of England and France were inflationists, especially King Henry. The 1700s was characterized by worldwide inflation. The American Revolution and French revolution were the precursors of the paper printing mania of the 20th century. Throughout history, rising prices have been the rule and not the exception.

# The 1920 Germany hyperinflation

One of the well-known examples of hyperinflation is that of Weimar Germany in the 1920s. In the early 1920s, Germany was in a period of hyperinflation. In the end, the mark was worth only one trillionth of its original value. By November of 1923, the currency would depreciate to 4,200,000,000,000 marks to one US dollar.

Below are examples of 20,000,000, 50,000,000, 1,000,000,000, and 5,000,000,000 mark bills. At the time of hyperinflation, ordinary Germans would use notes like these to purchase basic goods like bread.

# The German inflation had its roots in World War I

Leading up to World War I, Germany decided to drop the gold standard. The gold-backed Reichsmark (or “Goldmark,” as it was referred to from 1914) became the unbacked Papermark. Initially, the Reich financed its war outlays in large part by issuing debt. Total public debt rose from 5.2bn Papermark in 1914 to 105.3bn in 1918. Germany hoped that it would quickly win the war and reap the bounty from the nations it conquered. Like all other governments before them, the Germans first discovered the splendors and later the woes of inflation.

During the war, the government used propaganda to hide the dire situation of the economy from the German public. Regardless of their propaganda attempts, the Germans could feel its detrimental effect in their daily lives. As a consequence, many soldiers deserted the war to head back home to support their families. In November 1918, things reached a boiling point. From all walks of life, Germans across the political spectrum united and took control of Germany’s cities. Furious at their material conditions, they demanded an end to the war. Kaiser Wilhelm II’s monarchy was toppled, and the war ended.

# The treaty of Versailles

The new Weimar Republic faced tremendous economic and political challenges. Already under pressure from internal crises, the treaty of Versailles just added more fuel to the fire.  According to the treaty, repatriations were to be repaid to the victorious allies. These repatriations were equivalent to half a trillion contemporary US dollars. The new and fledgling democratic government wanted to cater as best as possible to the wishes of their voters. For this reason, the government opted not to increase taxes too aggressively. As a result of this, tax revenues were insufficient to finance these outlays. Consequently, the Reichsbank (Germany’s central bank) started running the printing press.

# The result of the German hyperinflation

From April 1920 to March 1921, the ratio of tax revenues to debt amounted to just 37 percent. As the Reichsbank printed more currency to make up the difference, the rates worsened, and hyperinflation quickly reared its head. At its height, hyperinflation in Weimar Germany reached rates of more than 30,000% per month. To put this into context, one has to compare the price of eggs over time. In 1918, you could have bought 500 billion eggs for the same money you would have to spend five years later for just one egg. Essentially the money was worthless. Prices of goods and services doubled every few days. In fact, the money was worth less than firewood. Below are some historic photos from the time.

# How did the German hyperinflation end?

Hyperinflation has become untenable. Farmers refused to take any form of paper money for their crops. The harvest of 1923 sat in farmers’ warehouses while supermarkets in the cities were empty. As a result, starvation and civil unrest loomed.

On Oct. 15, 1923, the Rentenmark Ordinance was published. This paved the way for a new currency to be issued by a new institution, the Rentenbank. This new currency would be equivalent in value to the gold-linked prewar mark, or Rentenmark. At last, the printing of the now-defunct Papermarks ceased on November 15th. On Nov. 20. The devalued Papermark was pegged to the Rentenmark at a trillion to one. As a consequence, the hyperinflation ended, and Germany was back on a gold standard system.

Interestingly, the Rentenbank apparently held no gold bullion. Instead, the bank held mostly debt in mortgages on property and bonds on the German industry. Moreover, the Rentenmark was also not redeemable in gold. The main thing with the Rentenmark was that its value remained equivalent to gold. This was accomplished by reducing its issuance if any threat of its market value fell below that parity. The mechanism that cured the hyperinflation was the simple adjustment of supply.

# Lessons learned from the German hyperinflation.

The first lesson is that even a politically independent central bank does not provide reliable protection against the destruction of (paper) money. The Reichsbank had been made politically independent as early as 1922 already. This was a request on behalf of the allied forces as a service rendered. In return, they temporarily agreed to deferred reparation payments. Still, the Reichsbank council decided to hyperinflate the currency.

The second lesson is that fiat paper money won’t work without being backed by some standard. Throughout history, the gold standard proved to be a great inflationary measure control. Paper money is political money, and as such, it is a disruptive element in a system of free markets that does more good than harm.

*""Ensuring the possibility for redeeming in gold at any one time must be the endeavor of all issuers of paper money."" -* HJALMAR SCHACHT

Paper money, injected into the economy through bank credit, brings about a situation of over-indebtedness. The policy of choice to cure the remedy of over-indebtedness? Printing even more money. Undoubtedly, it is a vicious cycle.

The present-day United States has been using credit-produced paper monies for decades. Because of this, we can draw many interesting similarities between the United States and the Weimar republic. But first, we will examine why the 2008 financial crisis stimulus-response never caused any significant inflation.

# The inflation that never happened

Many analysts erroneously compare what is happening now in the United States with what happened in 2008. In reality, the two situations could not have been more different.

When central banks print money at a fever pitch, it does not necessarily mean that money ends up in the hands of people and businesses. 2008 is a classic example of this. The modus operandi of the FED is to issue money by purchasing Treasuries and Mortgage-backed loans from the banks. In turn, this money goes to the bank’s reserves that they can then lend out.

So what happened in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis? Instead of lending the money out, the banks hoarded the cash themselves in a desperate attempt at self-preservation. It is important to keep in mind the economic climate at the time. The 2008 financial crisis was spurred on by banks not having sufficient cash reserves, causing them to default. After Lehman Brothers went bust, banks started hoarding as many reserves as possible.

The consequence? Most of the money printed by the FED never ended up in the hands of the people. As a result, inflation never increased. The below graph illustrates the amount of paper money held as reserves by banks in the U.S. Notice the increase after 2008.

# Why inflation in the U.S will rise

The reason is the same as all other inflation periods in history: too much money supply causing the currency to degenerate in value. A picture is worth a thousand words, and the below graph showing the money supply in the U.S economy shows it all.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hjpy98c3xp071.png?width=1168&format=png&auto=webp&s=5061a190ad0c8388206b38a64e7e9dc7f9a7b8be

In 2020 alone, the Federal Reserve printed more than 20% of all dollars ever printed. Illustrated by the graph above, one can see why there is an increasing concern in this regard. The 2020 money supply dwarfs out even the 2008 financial crisis response. In context, 2008 was a previous money printing record and has already raised concerns back then. In 2020 the Federal Reserve printed more money than the last four years combined.

# Why the Covid-19 stimulus will cause the inflation

We already touched on the fact that most of the money printed by the FED in 2008 ended up being hoarded by the banks. As a result, very little of the 2008 response made it into the hands of people and businesses. The Covid-19 relief stimulus package is very different in two respects. The first is that banks can not hoard any more money. They have reached full capacity regarding what reserves they can store before running into liquidity crises themselves. This is alarming because the banks hoarding money in 2008 was the only thing standing between the FED and a rapid rise in inflation. The second reason is unlike in 2008, billions of dollars are injected into the real economy into the hands of businesses and people. This is the typical pattern that has caused inflation throughout history. In fact, there is no difference.

# Banks complain they have too much money now.

The modus operandi of the FED is not much different in terms of raising money than it was in 2008. They followed the same recipe. If it worked for them in 2008, why would it not work now? The problem is that banks have too much money now. It does not seem like something that would be a problem for most people. Why would anyone complain about having too much money, you might ask. We will cover that in detail. First, have a look at the scrapbook of newspaper articles touching on the same subject.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/be3qwedbxp071.png?width=852&format=png&auto=webp&s=deb5cbb9ae23b2bccbe9d13f70ef2bdd90981357

To understand why too much money is a bad thing for banks, we first have to explain the basic business model of banks. Banks make their money by accepting deposits and then lending out their reserves at an interest rate. In return, they also pay an interest rate to the depositor, albeit a lower rate.

With the FED printing and raising money to the extent they have, banks already sit with too many reserves. Adding to that, you have all the extra deposits coming in from people receiving stimulus packages. At the same time, there is less appetite for people taking out loans due to the uncertainty regarding Covid-19. Banks now sit with deposits they have to pay interest on. At the same time, they are not making money from it by lending it out. Whereas in 2008, the banks were propping up the reserves, they are now desperate to lend out money.

Of course, there are other dimensions to this problem, like minimum regulatory capital requirements for each $1 deposited. Having too many reserves can also lead to banks running into liquidity issues.

In short, banks can not take on any more money. If there is any more rapid financing resulting from the FED printing more money, it will push banks into having liquidity issues. Unlike 2008, banks are desperate to lend out money. Add this money supply originating from the bank lending to the $2 trillion already released into the economy due to the stimulus, and you have the perfect inflation storm.

# The similarities between the Covid-19 stimulus package and past inflations

All inflation cycles in the past followed the same pattern. First, a rapid increase in money supply followed by the splendor of economic growth and prosperity. That, in turn, is later followed by inflation, leading to the death of currencies.

We already covered the fact that the saving grace in 2008 was that banks absorbed most of the money raised. Very little of the money printed by the FED made it into the hands of people. The Covid-19 stimulus is very different in this regard. This time around, the U.S. stimulus package allocates more than $2 trillion to different groups in society, injecting money into the real economy. The breakdown is as follows:

* $560 billion to individuals
* $500 billion to large corporations
* $377 billion to small businesses
* $340 billion to state and local governments
* $154 billion for public health
* $44 billion for education and other causes

Not only that, together with the stimulus by the previous Trump administration, the total stimulus amounts to more than 27 percent of the U.S GDP. That’s nearly four times the share implemented in response to the 2008 financial crisis.

The only other country with a more aggressive stimulus response to the Covid-19 pandemic is Japan. We all know Japan is not really the poster child to follow when it comes to inflation. Japan has been struggling with deflation for more than two decades.

# Why we conclude inflation will rise in the U.S

There is nothing new in terms of inflation, from the days of our earliest ancestors to the present day. The magic of money causes the death of money. Every time in history where governments have resulted in printing more unbacked paper money to stimulate economies, inflation followed.

The one exception was 2008. The reason for that is that banks absorbed most of the money. As a result, most of the stimulus the money did not make it into the real economy. The Covid-19 stimulus package is different in this regard. First of all, the banks don’t have the capacity to absorb more money without running into liquidity issues themselves. The second and most important difference with 2008 is the injection of $2 trillion into different parts of the economy. This is the same classic example we have seen throughout history. Not much more needs to be said about that other than throughout history, where more money was injected into the economy at this scale, inflation always followed without fail.

We saw a slight bump in spending due to short term stimmy checks, tax returns, and bottlenecks on the global supply chains creating artificial supply shortages. This led to a temporary bump in prices across a lot of sectors..

Now onto the second and larger point. Everyone seems to think that because in their Econ 101 course that low interest rates eventually causes inflation. This was true up until the late 70s in the US when wealth inequality was still fairly low. Now we live in a new paradigm of wealth inequality. Since the 80s both interest rates and inflation rates have been declining - I will gladly provide links but also feel free to see the data for yourself. This is because despite money lending getting easier and easier, we have massive concentrations of wealth, so all this new money is going into fewer and fewer hands. You can’t raise prices across the board for goods when the average person doesn’t have more money to spend. It did happen the last couple quarters but again that’s because of stimmy’s and unemployment benefits. 

We must keep interest rates low until unemployment fully recovers. Wealth has still yet to trickle down because trickle down barely works. Most at the top are good at plugging up all the leaks. 

But lastly, even if all y’all’s inflation fears are true, aren’t stocks one of the best assets to have during those times? Cash becomes useless, bonds go nowhere, stonks ride inflation to the moon. So TLDR : inflation isn’t happening, but even if it is, keep investing in stonks."

2021-05-22 21:55:09,wallstreetbets,"This is a very poorly informed post, written by somebody who certainly never read any economics books or papers past maybe econ 102. (And since the disclaimer says this was written by some random blog, these critiques are not directed at the OP).

First off, let me just point out that economists actually do not agree on how to measure inflation. No, ""more money printed"" is not inflation. No, ""more money velocity"" is not inflation. No, ""price of gas/milk/homes/[other specific commodity] is going up"" is not inflation. It's a mixture of all of these, weighted somewhat arbitrarily, and almost all think tanks have their own metric on measuring it. Even looking at the government's metric for inflation isn't perfect, as a 10% spike in used car prices is contributing to most of the scary inflation value coming out of April.

Inflation going back to ancient history is also slightly misguided, as inflation is specifically tied to fiat currency and not to goods in general. More animal skins to trade is not akin to economic principle of inflation; animal skins have a base use value as a commodity, not exclusively as a currency, so their being devalued is a supply increase, distinctly different from inflation. The coins example from Rome is better, but fraudulent coins and government crackdowns on that area are a better indicator of the loss of value than simply more in circulation.

Germany ~1920 did experience hyperinflation, and the cause is aptly described with the Treaty of Versailles debt (every country printed money for war; it was not the unique causative factor). The lessons learned are not accurate though. Money does not need some standard backing to be valuable: the US dollar is the world reserve currency because of trust and faith in the US' ability to honor that obligation, or, in other words, the US is the world's hegemon and declared its currency is super valuable and nobody had the balls to tell us we're wrong in the face of our massive military. In fact, it is entirely necessary for any sovereign country's currency - if it wants a sound economic policy - to NOT have a tangible backing, so that under a crisis such as a pandemic, they can inject cash into the system to prop it up (this was the biggest lesson of the 2008 financial crisis).

So now we get to the argument of why inflation will rise, and none is convincing. Yes, we printed a lot of money this past year; yes, a good chunk of that money went into the hands of regular people. But as I stated above, none of this actually means inflation will be significantly high in the foreseeable future. More money is created by bank lending than federal reserve policy - significantly more. This is why the US is primarily considered a debt-driven economy: money I put in the bank is lent out to you who buys assets that goes into another person's bank which lends it out to someone else, so on and so forth, a multiplicative effect of spending ability stemming from my initial deposit. The fed printing dollars (or changing numbers on a spreadsheet to be exact) is no different, except that the Fed is doing it, not your local JP Morgan.

The thing is, the Federal Reserve historically does not often hit its 2% per year inflation goal, usually hovering around 1.8%. This means our economy could take a little higher inflation like 2.4% for a year or two and be fine. But even if 2021 hits 2.4% inflation or higher, it's still going to be marginally impactful because 2020 was a deflationary year! If you extrapolate our inflation from Feb 2019 to now, we're exactly where we would be without a pandemic: a ~1.9% YoY inflation level. We're not on the verge of a hyperinflation to 50%. We're not about to see the collapse of the American economy. We're not about to see gold prices spike to 5x overnight. We're just hitting a rough transitionary patch as we reel back the support spending and move into the normal economy.

TL;DR normal inflation relax your butthole

Can you expand on this point please? I am unable to understand this logically. How does having 100,000 on hand, compared to 10,000 on hand make you more likely to have liquidity issues? Having more money on hand improves your ability to handle liquidity issues. That's the whole point of bank regulations requiring them to hold a certain amount of capital on hand for every $1 in deposits - to reduce the risk of liquidity issues from depositors suddenly withdrawing money."

Inflation/Stagflation has been around before the pandemic, interest rate was reduced below 1% when it wasn't necessary. We've been living in an inflated environment since Yellen was head of the Feds.

2021-05-23 10:33:32,wallstreetbets,Rhymes at the end.
2021-05-23 10:50:53,wallstreetbets,"There are so many inaccuracies in this piece I don't know where to begin. The last century of data across most of the planet suggests rapid money supply growth is more likely to PREVENT inflation than to cause it. https://www.ineteconomics.org/perspectives/blog/rapid-money-supply-growth-does-not-cause-inflation

The other is that this whole talk of ""human nature"" and the origins of money is incredibly bad anthropology and just macho-man fantasy.

The vast majority of money is credit and the first form of ""money"" was probably just a verbal promise. So a lot of this talk about cash is meaningless if it doesn't mention credit. Note how even today, 90% of transactions are done on credit or debit rather than cash. 

There's no reason to assume fiat or promises always fail or that a gold standard is necessary. Tribes still exist today without it and I'm sure the promise you made to your wife's boyfriend are good. Anyway, currency standards have failed just as often. 

Perhaps the only interesting thing in the article is that banks are saying they have too much cash. As the world reserve currency, global demand for US deposits has created large deflationary pressures and has helped keep inflation at bay for the last 30 years (busting unions, slashing taxes, outsourcing to asia and bombing OPEC has kept inflation away too).

If inflation starts happening now, its largely due to supply side reasons from covid and the canal blockage . Its not because of some imaginary substance like utility devaluing the dollar. Economists havent yet reconciled how money can be a store of value that you save and yet has less value the more there is. For microeconomics, money doesnt have diminishing utility like other commodities. Yet for some reason the macroeconomists assume it does.

Last thing is, why do these talks of inflation always always always revolve around the government creating more money? Banks create money too. Businesses create money when they issue commercial paper. Mutual funds create money. Heck, during the Irish Bank strikes of the 70s, people creates money by writing their own damn IOUs on napkins at the pub. No screams of inflation were heard. Whats with the double standard? And if governments can create inflation so easily why has Japan been begging for it for over 20 years?"

2021-05-22 20:13:05,wallstreetbets,Well we agree to disagree then. Money is controlled. It is no more than a tool to control economy. Hyperinflation is not a possibility because money itself can be made expensive by raising interest. If inflation is not adjusted by raising interest you can get hyperinflation. The fed is playing a tricky game not raising interest now but it will never come to hyperinflation. They have no alternative and will rais interest. Turkey is a good example. Keep interest low and the lira is worth nothing. We’ve learned from the past. Unlimited increase of the money is no big deal as long as it is controlled by interests.

increasing demand for x is going to drive the price up.  you limit demand in the private sector by increasing interest rates making starting new business or taking loans a non option. you then remove the assets from the feds balance sheet.

Due to the reasons you listed and probably the fact that it established itself as so over the years, is why it still is after the US dollar becoming fiat.

I don't see how increased supply is not a convincing argument, scarcity can create value for something. But I suppose as long as it managed, it's fine. 1.8%  yearly typically, as you noted. Inflation is a loss of purchasing power by definition. I don't see why one wouldn't be able to apply supply and demand to the currency itself, even if economist don't agree on how to measure it.

But I just wanted to note. We didn't become the worlds reserve currency being a fiat currency.

If they were to meet back in the past, obviously the US would never have become the world reserve currency without being a hard currency tied to gold and or silver. Being the world reserve currency gives us some resistance against hyperinflation.

If people were to meet up today and decide on a global reserve currency. I could see that currency being fiat. People think differently today. Note the bias towards fiat currency being good.

I imagine there are pros and cons to fiat and hard based currency. Without looking into it, I'm sure we would've liked to be a fiat currency at the start. But that was probably the trade off to being allowed to be the global reserve currency at the time."

But in short, our understanding is that deflation is happening in Japan because people save more and spend less. And the more deflation happens, the more people hoard money, causing a vicious deflation cycle.

  
So deflation in the U.S would imply people hoarding money under their mattresses to the extent that the money supply decrease. The odds of that happening? We don't know.

2021-05-23 15:24:29,wallstreetbets,"Yes sure. Grappled with this ourselves to understand logically at first so happy to explain. Back to accounting 101. When banks receive a deposit it is a double accounting entry. It is both an asset and a liability. An asset because they can lend out the money in the future and earn from it and liability because they have to pay interest as well as the initial deposit back to the depositor. 

Because it is a liability, the banks must keep certain equity to the liability threshold due to regulatory requirements. If there is a slow down in lending not making up this difference and providing the equity required, banks have to raise this money externally or face a situation where they don't have enough equity to satisfy regulatory requirements."

Then we only used the highest denomination bill (100 bs) in 2016 ish. After that Maduro’s regime issued several new bills (100,000 bs and so on) but these would only be useful for a couple weeks. Since that happened people started to rely on digital currency (cards, bank accounts, direct transfers, etc) and that held on until mid 2019. Of course that also felt out because hyperinflation is relentless so we have been going through an unofficial dollarization and rn our “main” currency is the dollar. Because of that the prices of goods are dollarized so that thing that with 100 dollars you could be king is a thing of the past. The silver and gold market has been completely hijacked by the dictatorship, destroying our portion of the Amazon and using the help of criminal groups to finance themselves so you can see that, if you don’t already have silver or gold since before all of that, it’s next to impossible to acquire those commodities to have a couple bucks in the pocket.

As the economy started to normalize eventually all of that money came out and spending was dramatically up.  At the same time Germany was printing marks out of thin air to buy foreign currencies to pay their war reparations punishment from WWI.

We have both going on.  Stimulus checks have built a surplus of money in many households and velocity is currently low and about to head higher and the government is printing money out of thin air to pay for things that it truly can't afford.

To your point, if the US dollar has a severe collapse it will likely come from foreigners not having faith in it.  The US dollar is the reserve currency and if it loses that many dollars will flood back in to the US all at once."
2021-05-23 04:40:59,wallstreetbets,"We disagree with your analysis.

Trying to measure the dollar to commodities like silver is simply ignorant. In fact the silver price in 1975 was about the same by 2005. The CPI in that same period increased 3.66X. In other words, silver declined in value as quick as the dollar declined in value (some hedge for inflation! I know, only 30 years of time there). Heck, holding ornamental gourds would have made more sense."
2021-05-23 09:34:06,wallstreetbets,"Didn't realize you were linking to your own blog, so I'll hit your point and bring it back to WSB:

Comparing the dollar against silver is exactly the fault of inflation modern economists try to avoid. Silver is now a commodity, bought and sold, so its price will vary with that. If tomorrow scientists find silver can cure cancer, its price will skyrocket via utility increase, but that doesn't mean the US dollar has lost significant value overnight. Real estate has similarly shot up in value since the 1960's, but even if the US dollar were originally backed by land (""One dollar for one acre of land!""), we wouldn't measure today's purchasing power to real estate. When using the word inflation, it's proper to treat it as the scientific term it is, and not some stand-in for a commodity's price going up.

To bring in the WSB angle, yes, people can still make money off of inflation-resistant goods like gold and silver. Someone who YOLO'd into silver in 1960 probably would be pretty rich today. That's a solid investment strategy, but a 60-year hold doesn't strike me as WSB's modus operandi. And since hyperinflation is not right around the corner, it's unlikely people will make significant money overnight (unless other people buy it because they also believe gold will spike, but that's a different story with different game theory)."
2021-05-23 04:43:55,wallstreetbets,"Then explain to me what happened in the period of 1980-current.

The 1970's was a period marked by going off the gold standard are various other factors. By 1980 things stabilized and probably makes more sense to look from there onward. The period of time of transition is perhaps just an anomaly."

2021-05-22 21:11:28,wallstreetbets,"I’m saying that the US holds an economjc superposition.  The dollar will never result in Weimar-style or Zimbabwe-style inflation because it is world reserve currency.  It does not express value anymore.  And hasn’t since 1933.  And definitely since the collapse of the Breton Woods agreement.  The dollar can be printed ad infinitum because it doesn’t just draw on the capital produce by its territory but from the capital of the world (hence why it can run deficits no other country can).  By printing, I mean they trade it for treasury bonds.  There’s no actual printing.  It’s all digital.  
OP confuses money, especially commodity money, with the dollar—valueless fiat currency.  They do not behave the same, and the dollar has not behaved the same since its decoupling from gold. Because it is valueless, it must express wages as valueless; express labor as valueless.  It doesn’t matter if wages go up; what they can purchase goes down.  That’s the hidden “inflation.”"

But doesn't the bank have a few mechanics to prevent this? The most simple would be to just stop taking deposits. They are under no obligation to accept the deposit from someone. They could also change the interest rate depositors earn as well at their own discretion (assuming we are talking about a typically Savings/Checking account and not CDs). So if the bank feels like they are approaching a liquidity event, or may be at risk of breaching regulation capital requirements, cannot they just alter one of these two valves?"

most actual dollars printed are not even in the US. 

it is partially why some people think the US can continue to print money and not have inflation..

That being said he does think silver is in for a huge price jump but that silver tends to be one of the last commodities to go up during commodity super cycles.

What I mean is, if all investors who are interested in PMs buy physical, that would have a large impact on the price and their investments will grow. If half those people instead buy miners hoping for higher returns, then the PM price does not go up significantly and nobody makes money. So I see it as sort of self defeating.

Raise interest rates too quickly and things could deflate too fast. Even just the current spike in inflation and debate on an interest rate rise might create enough behaviour change to stop the economy over heating as people look to defend against rate rises in the future.

2021-05-22 21:51:04,wallstreetbets,"high inflation comes before hyperinflation and the jump to go from one to other can get out of hand quickly. Same reason people fear deflation... Also having a inflation rate that it self is inflating is a sign things were heading in that direction. the US went from 4% to 15% with the rate of inflation increasing....the US went into a major recession to stop inflation by having 20% interest rates.

your claim that it can only happen if the country is having an issue if there is a war or lost production or one item is false as you can cause massive hyper inflation with just bad monetary policy but most countries are not ran by retards that will inflate their asset values away.

also most countries got into hyperinflation by printing money to pay their debts. This eventually caused a feed back loop resulting in them having to reissue new currency...  

my economic professor dealing with global markets was from Argentina. he had a few words about his countries economic policy seeing as they had to issue a new currency that also failed. 

A 10% inflation rate means inflation would be 500% or 5 times above target inflation rate of 2%. 

it is like saying the US going from 2% gdp growth to 3% is small when it is a 50% increase in the rate of change.... we are currently looking at a 6% growth."

If you've ever checked out pricing for government purchases, you will see state and other taxes built in to the cost side of the ledger, not the profit side.  You also have to take into account inflationary pressures, which were and are higher than reported. You'll feel them acutely soon, especially after the infrastructure printing press happens, so get ready."

I suppose by the transitive property, you could say rich families own private banks, and private banks are members of the fed, and therefore rich families own the fed.

They don't own it, but there is a connection.

Is the fed corrupt, idk. But it's creation was certainly done in a secret manner. Passed when a lot of congress was on vacation in 1913, and drafted in relative secret by major banking families/rich families. They met at Jekyll Island.

There certainly is a Rothschild connection. As a banking family. Banks control money flow. How nefarious this is, is up you to decide. It is somewhat natural for a bank to think about wanting a national bank. But a foreign bank having a hand in our national bank?

I'm personally not fond of the manner I hear the federal reserve was created. But if you insist on the current economic system, you need a national bank. Is this the fed? Currently yes. Could it be done better? idk. Are there other systems, sure. Are they better, idk, maybe.

2021-05-23 11:50:29,wallstreetbets,Well qualify for 3% down and the ability to make minimum payments. The cash buyers were there in 2008 as well so that's a bit irrelevant.
2021-05-23 10:37:46,wallstreetbets,(((Capitalism)))
2021-05-22 22:29:57,wallstreetbets,"Well, isn’t that how capitalism works...?!?!

Edit: referring to the companies finding a way around the tariffs and buying IS mills fair and square. Not the protectionist tariffs."
2021-05-23 11:12:16,wallstreetbets,"I work in construction areas and the amount of 2x4 and sheets of plywood I see thrown away in new home construction is surprising.  I need to start going and dumpster diving.  I helped a little old man fill his pickup truck with discarded 2x4s a bit ago he was so excited, it was probably $500 in wood his truck was loaded up to overflowing."
2021-05-23 12:27:51,wallstreetbets,Where did you get that great of a deal???
2021-05-23 11:11:40,wallstreetbets,You could and pay some landlord a premium to rent until housing prices fall back to normal.  Depending on the profit from your home sale it could be a great move.
2021-05-23 11:11:54,wallstreetbets,A camper. Wait for a housing crash. Profit
2021-05-23 11:44:12,wallstreetbets,"By vulnerable industry, you mean the highly profitable and monopolized lumber industry?"
2021-05-23 16:03:01,wallstreetbets,"If so many people are paying cash it’s not the same as 2008. Prices aren’t being propped up by poorly qualified borrowers. 

I don’t understand why we even needed all this Covid mortgage forgiveness crap. Everyone got massive unemployment payments plus stimulus money. There was no need to stop making mortgage payments."
2021-05-23 02:46:11,wallstreetbets,The steel tarriffs still are in place... what are you talking about? It saved the american steel industry and there wasnt an apocalypse at the coca cola plant. Makes me question your whole post. Just seems like you wanted to insert politics.
2021-05-22 20:12:39,wallstreetbets,but Canada owns the US saw mills...... so how is it protectionism when it is Canada based companies that own US equipment?
2021-05-22 22:36:43,wallstreetbets,"no it is how governments and private business function.  If we,were talking about capitalism the US wouldn't have done most of what it is doing or has done. 

don't try being cute."
2021-05-23 11:33:16,wallstreetbets,Oh it's amazing. But all prices into the budget which they sell to the new home owners. Developers ain't stupid
2021-05-23 12:39:40,wallstreetbets,This was 4 months ago lol
2021-05-23 11:33:01,wallstreetbets,"Ya except to rent something half the size of my house would be over double my mortgage, a one bedroom one bath in my area is 1,300 while I live in a 5 bedroom 5 bath, I really just need a 4 bedroom place but that costs somewhere north of 3k a month while my mortgage is just $1,200 a month.  I would have to stop my WSB addiction if I were to do this.

I know what you are saying and I would walk with a ton of money but my wife would not like me for it, she loves this home and we would never be we to replace it unless we were able to buy this particular home."
2021-05-23 11:21:17,wallstreetbets,"Unfortunately I still have kids at home and my wife loves our home so much.  It would cost an insane amount of money to build this house today.  Our walls are 18 inches deep and my wife just loves the house, she actually bought it without me ever seeing it as it was one of those things where if you do not buy it now it will be too expensive tomorrow.  I have never seen a other house like this but also billionaires don't usually build their homes in normal neighborhoods but to a level beyond sanity of a normal person.  The creator of a large tech company from the 90s to 2000s lived in this house til he died and we were the recipients of this place.  We probably will never sell unless the university comes wanting to buy our land which is pretty likely as we are right next to it and they have been buy up neighborhoods.  

It's not always black and white when thinking about selling a home, though I wish it could be."

2021-05-23 10:17:29,wallstreetbets,"It was just about no logging , PERIOD! When Oregon was logging we had money for everything. Schools and infrastructure were fully funded. Then came the tree huggers in 79. They stopped everything. Even sensible clearing of underbrush to limit the destruction of fires. The US FOREST Services hands are tied."
2021-05-23 09:32:50,wallstreetbets,Don't know what's left to burn. We have a lot of charcoal.
2021-05-22 20:51:32,wallstreetbets,Lots of the land is crown land aka owned by the government and they sell the stumps for cheaper allegedly but its not subsidized.
2021-05-23 10:56:23,wallstreetbets,"Nah we just have a lot of fucking land and trees.  Its endless up here. Its stupid to set our prices dependent on usa privatized lands where they can price gouge.  Every time the usa loses in the wto courts on this issue. 

The usa is welcome to shit on our dairy or telecom industry tho."
2021-05-23 13:19:19,wallstreetbets,So too is u.s. timber that’s harvested on public lands. Forest service pays the logging companies to build the logging roads.
2021-05-23 16:30:07,wallstreetbets,Nope all the free money for business was not necessary either. Lots of business owners got a massive windfall from Covid and the ones who were truly screwed like restaurants weren’t actually helped enough.

That’s why the US is behind many other nations on a lot of things. They won’t allow fair competition, they pick the winners, we don’t get a vote with our wallets."
2021-05-23 15:56:16,wallstreetbets,it is cronyism. what ever economic system comes after doesn't matter. also other countries also have corruption issues especially in Europe.
2021-05-23 16:28:01,wallstreetbets,"True but not as bad. Europe didn’t allow tobacco and pharmaceutical companies to put out false studies and crush the vaping industry for instance. The royal college of physicians actually tested it, and determined it’s 96%safer than tobacco. US allowed pharma and tobacco to demonize it, even though it has been proven false. I know this is just the tip of the iceberg but every regulation law now days, seems to be written by a corporation. Much like Obamacare was written by insurance companies to make themselves rich."

Almost exactly like playing options."

2021-05-23 00:33:26,wallstreetbets,"I’m bag holding too but am struggling to see the long term vision and utility for this service. Anybody got any input on viability, something to suggest I hold beyond recouping my loss & dumping this?"
2021-05-22 22:43:33,wallstreetbets,I'm gonna get calls at open so it's gonna go down
2021-05-22 22:42:33,wallstreetbets,"SPCE is a scam stock. SPACEX was able to develop an autonomous, self-landing, reusable rocket carrying NASA astronauts to the Space Station.

And in the same amount of time SPCE built a terminal building for 0 passengers and strapped a jet engine to a plane that can barely fly, has never been to space, and can't get to altitude on its own. And fighter jets have been around for decades. SPCE is a space tourism company with 0 tourists that has never been to space.

Seems like a solid investment? This company is poorly managed, lagging behind, and going nowhere anytime soon."
2021-05-23 00:02:57,wallstreetbets,"Losing proposition. $250K to spend ten minutes in weightlessness throwing some skittles around and catching them in your mouth. They go out of business in one year.

I predict SpaceX will have a ride that will go around earth three times and cost the same as Virgin Galactic."
2021-05-23 01:02:43,wallstreetbets,"I’m in at 29 have taken some profits over the last year, afraid this flight won’t move the stock due to overall market conditions right Now."

2021-05-23 09:53:49,wallstreetbets,Last fri i had free 10.000 wasn't sure where yo go  between  rocket and Virgin . Went for rocket and I'm down 1.62% what a mistake I would be up 32% now . But anyway I'm in Mon  . To the mooooon🚀🚀🚀🚀
2021-05-23 16:56:15,wallstreetbets,That’s not a real rocket: It’s just a wine bottle opener. But whatever. I’ll play. Let’s get nutty.
2021-05-23 17:08:16,wallstreetbets,If I put a limit order in at 21.50 will it go through in the morning?  Or will volume be to high and it might not fill?
2021-05-22 22:43:56,wallstreetbets,Dump it
2021-05-23 10:21:11,wallstreetbets,"As someone who follows the space industry pretty close, anyone investing long on this company is dumb. Their tech has no scalability and their current tech is already close to being obsolete. I think Blue Origins new Shepard is dumb too but really it's the same experience that is significantly safer. The biggest thing that's gonna make all these companies fail is spacexs starship. It I'll become cheaper to do a moon fly by than a VG flight and that's in the next 5 years. VGs space plane was made in the idea that nothing like starship would ever exist or wouldn't exist for any real worrisome time. If you are gonna invest in any rocket/space company try rocket lab. They have some partnerships now that make them publicly traded. They are still no where near spacex but they are going a similar route and have full re-use for their orbital rockets in mind."
2021-05-22 23:54:22,wallstreetbets,Im not a believer in this company.

2021-05-23 10:25:07,wallstreetbets,"Kinda, it skirts the arbitrary line that's considered space but it's not an orbital flight. So it just goes up for a few minutes and then back down."

2021-05-23 10:26:36,wallstreetbets,I guarantee you they will never hit that cadence. If they get really good I could maybe see 1 a month. The amount of people in this sub spouting absolutely ridiculous figures about this company is hilarious.

2021-05-23 12:39:38,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I don’t see that happening at least sustained over a long period unless they increase the size of the plane to hold way more people, make it cheaper (this will happen) and figure out some way to not have to tow it to 40,000 feet first."
2021-05-23 12:41:12,wallstreetbets,"Idk, I’m planning on selling it if it gets back to the 50’s. I’m holding in the low 20’s due to DCA but not convinced of the long term appeal or use case."

Positions: https://imgur.com/gallery/7ZK85CN

I posted [this](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/DKNG/u6wmRMkT-What-s-next-for-DKNG-Part-2/) on 5/8, saying if we dont pop off the 50d SMA, we gonna crash down and find some support at the ~42.5 level. We’ll proceed to consolidate for a few weeks from there and build support. We did exactly that.

So what’s next?
I think DraftKings is about to absolutely explode or die down to 30d SMA on the 2hr (~43.60) and then pop up. Either way this is looking extremely bullish.

https://imgur.com/gallery/iRKkNFM

I believe we’re going to break out of this current wedge and push to the 50d SMA on the weekly chart. There’s absolute no volume support above the current resistance point. We could essentially “gap” up to about ~49.5 and then trickle down to build consolidation and fill the volume support from 44.5-49.5. This a 100 stock in a year no question, but the short term pop is the play.

https://imgur.com/gallery/YjmtM9F


I back tested the current chart set up on the 2hr, we’re crunched between the 7d SMA and 50d SMA. Since DKNG dropped the SPAC, these are the next day or day after results of the same exact setup. 

02/10 +10.48%

03/04 +13.89%

03/25 +1.62%

07/16 +9.46%

09/09 +9.11%

11/05 +9.05%

1/08/21 +4.48%

3/10/21 +11.48%

04/26/21 +1.91%

05/21/21 ???

I believe Canada senate vote on Tuesday could offer us a breakout of the current wedge and give us a nice pump. But who knows. Lets see what happens. The TA is there. I’m holding january calls, august calls, shares and friday right before close I bought weeklies because of this setup. 

Also, Nebreska, Indiana, Maryland, Florida, NY all on the brink of passing some legislation.

2021-05-22 20:14:25,wallstreetbets,"I was referring to DFS, not the sports book. I reside in a state that doesn't support online wagering. My reference to the VIG was in context to the amount of entries over break even. For instance their 3 million golf contest. 20 dollar entry and entries capped at 177,700 approximate. 550,000.00 dollar potential profit if the contest fills. Payout is guaranteed so if it doesn't make 150,000 entries they lose money. Most contest's fill so generally not an issue. My point is that in the past contests like that were capped at approximately 164,000 entries. Just an observation from my experience with their site."

thursday market open it was up 22% and then dropped to 14%, but you have to realize that short interest also spiked massively along with it and even though they announced a flight you can go through plenty of comments on this subreddit and just general sentiment where people thought the plane would break up in the sky or would find some ""unplanned issue"" to abort the flight, but they actually did it without a fucking hitch"

2021-05-23 19:14:27,wallstreetbets,"Yea and after checking on some stats -  it was only Mack 2, so loud that no one wanted to ride it (vs low boom virgin galactic), built for too many passengers considering it was meant for luxury travel, and NASA is desperately looking for a better version of why the Concorde was. They also didn’t reach suborbital space. Did I miss anything? While you’re comment wasn’t conversational and rather somewhat condescending I do think it’d be a good idea for someone to create and show a side by side of the differences of Virgin Galactic, Concorde, and alternate competitors specifically in the thrall NASA is after with VG."

2021-05-23 00:28:10,wallstreetbets,"Anyone who didn’t study/live thru the 1980s…thinks double digit inflation is hyper.

Nope…the 10Year hit 16% in the 80s and the stonk market chugged along…not amazing returns…but good compared to the 1970s.

The biggest issue is the Fed…keeping emergency policy going almost 15 years after the emergency.

Now, the market is totally addicted to the Fed’s ultra low rates and even normal inflation puts the Fed in a corner.

The Fed is terrified of raising rates…they won’t even discuss tapering the $120B per month they buy in bonds/mortgage debt.

$120B per month…$1.44T per year.

This is a scary game of inflation chicken.

The longer the Fed waits the more extreme the inflation will be…instead of tapping the brakes they’ll be forced to slam the brakes.

We’re in uncharted territory.

Everyone should be a bit nervous."
2021-05-23 03:22:31,wallstreetbets,"The only people shouting inflation is CNBC and friends who bet on a crash that didn’t happen

JP Morgan and plenty of the other power house investors are sitting in the corner laughing at their futile idea."
2021-05-23 05:09:11,wallstreetbets,"Why hyperinflation? Insane wealth gap and general uncertainty currently causes the cyclic money velocity to come almost to a halt. No money velocity, no wide-spread inflation. Maybe we even get deflation together with violent local bubbles wherever the rich try to escape their income to. Crazy times, but also times of great opportunity if you can think one step ahead.."
2021-05-23 09:42:44,wallstreetbets,"I’ll be concerned when GDP doesn’t grow, with all these people not working I can see that happening 

The real concern is the Fed is driving the GDP growth and if that’s true when the payments and cheap financing are gone you may have a problem.

Stagflation seems much more likely than hyperinflation, we won’t see hyperinflation until USD is replaced with the China dollar as world reserve currency."
2021-05-22 21:24:58,wallstreetbets,"If the current trend continues, we're on track for 11% inflation this year. IMO we're more likely to get steady 14-15% inflation."
2021-05-23 13:40:18,wallstreetbets,"Its crazy that some politicians are so out of touch with reality they'll deny paying people more to sit home and do nothing than they'd make working is keeping people from going to work.
 
Personally, I'd take a 50% pay cut if I could accompany it with a 100% hour cut...if I could take a 100% hour cut with a 10% raise, why would I not do it?"
2021-05-23 13:57:49,wallstreetbets,Don't forget the double digit interest rates in the 80s.  If we went back to that the interest on our national debt would be more than the federal budget has been in recent years.
2021-05-23 14:03:33,wallstreetbets,Horrible GDP growth is going to be masked by inflation.  Democrats will be bragging if we have decent GDP growth this year and the average person is too stupid to realize its a net loss if you have maybe 4% GDP growth but 8% inflation and trillions more in government debt.
2021-05-22 21:33:21,wallstreetbets,Maybe 11% inflation this year...but then they will be forced to raise rates and that shouldn't be much of an issue next year
2021-05-23 15:52:35,wallstreetbets,Yeah I don’t blame them
2021-05-23 13:43:37,wallstreetbets,Scary that people are oblivious to this.

We prolly won’t ever go back to 16%…but that was just a context for today’s insanity.

2021-05-23 04:44:38,wallstreetbets,I'm going to give you a one time 1million dollar piece of advice  The election was stolen but it doesn't actually matter anymore.  The smart people are 5 steps ahead your poor dumb joke ass.  Hee hee haw haw hee!
2021-05-23 13:13:55,wallstreetbets,"And temporary or transient inflation are the newest buzzwords for people dumb enough to think socialism is a good idea.  If inflation were temporary that would mean it would go away in the future, but its not.  If we have 15% inflation this year and 3% inflation next year, the 15% from this year didn't just go away, our money has still be devalued by that amount.  If we had 15% inflation this year then 15% deflation next year, then it would have gone away, but its pretty obvious since we've gotten off the gold standard that isn't how things work anymore lol."
2021-05-22 21:38:38,wallstreetbets,They literally can't raise rates. The low rates from 2008 were supposed to be temporary. That was 13 years ago. They tried in 2018-19 but had to stop.
2021-05-23 13:43:21,wallstreetbets,"Lol...170k illegals crossed the border last month alone.  Literally the most we've seen in a month in decades.  Its not that ""maybe"" you are wrong, its that your head is so far up your butt I'm wondering how you haven't suffocated yet."
2021-05-22 20:32:02,wallstreetbets,"I’m theorizing that the future of the economy will continue to work that way- distributing gains basically solely to those who own assets. My parents don’t have any, but I have good friends, so we decided to communalize and start buying as many assets as we can together. I’m 24, so hopefully I’ll still be able to win this stupid economy lol."

2021-05-22 21:50:00,wallstreetbets,"They will eventually have to raise rates,  not sure about the debt though lol"
2021-05-23 13:02:18,wallstreetbets,"We've had more QE in the last 6 months than we have had in the decade following the 09 meltdown on top of ~4 trillion in money printing for Covid ""stimulus"" over the last year, and people pushing for trillions more in government spending on top of our annual budget that would have run at a deficit like it has for decades now anyhow...and inflation is the result of migrant workers(ironically at a time when illegals are pouring over here at a rate not seen in decades) not picking strawberries?
 
You make so little sense you probably are the kind of guy that thinks socialism is a good idea lol."
2021-05-23 02:45:43,wallstreetbets,"simply “having a reason” doesn’t make it good, the electoral college is stupid"
2021-05-22 21:55:50,wallstreetbets,"Doing so will collapse the whole system. Rates had to be raised to 20% in 1980 to stop the inflation. Haha they can't even raise to 2% now without total collapse. There is no end game. Invest how you wish, good luck."
2021-05-23 13:36:44,wallstreetbets,"~3%(which would still be a low rate by historical standards) on a ~30 trillon dollar national debt means our yearly interest obligations would cost almost as much as social security lol.
 
I saw an article a few weeks ago saying the April inflation number was the highest we have seen since 1981...when interest rates were 16.9%.  If we got back to that interest rate we'd be paying ~5 trillion a year in interest...in other words, interest would cost us more than the rest of the federal budget combined."
2021-05-22 22:07:58,wallstreetbets,Wouldn't steady 15% inflation cause equal damage to the system?
2021-05-23 12:03:46,wallstreetbets,Yes stagflation for 4 years until we vote in a republican again
2021-05-22 22:21:42,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, the choices are collapse or collapse hahaha"
2021-05-22 20:28:02,wallstreetbets,Dude wtf are u on about?!  There’s restaurants and stores that closed that were opened for decades and because of the pandemic and were forced to close ended up not being able to pay rents or bills and closed for good. It’s not just one here and one there. This is happening in every state.
2021-05-22 20:32:41,wallstreetbets,"Because the business owners were too stupid to fill out pandemic relief? What the fuck are you talking about?

2021-05-22 20:40:54,wallstreetbets,"Omg my local plus sized clothing boutique closed down. They were never profitable the whole fucking year they existed. The pandemic didn't kill them. Their shitty business was dead to start.

9/10 businesses fail without a pandemic. You are on some dumb shit if you think solid businesses got hurt from covid."
2021-05-22 22:53:11,wallstreetbets,"Maybe they just didn’t want to take on crushing debt. Those loans required you continue to pay your staff to not work. Where do you get your facts Jack?

Go see a proctologist about getting your countenance removed from your favorite leftists ass."
2021-05-22 20:43:14,wallstreetbets,Ok genius how did businesses that existed for over 50yrs who just closed down were supposed to survive with less than 30% capacity? With weeks completely closed. With them having then to buy extra stuff like masks and more sanitation stuff etc....how can you say it Disney affect the closing down of businesses🤦🏻‍♂️
2021-05-22 23:17:50,wallstreetbets,"They could apply for pandemic relief. If they didn't, they were run by fucking idiots."

The issuer (GameStop) should then investigate further to determine how that has happened and where the real shares are. There’s a great AMA with Wes Christian.

2021-05-23 11:34:45,wallstreetbets,"Yes, when I buy a phone I don’t necessarily care what brand the battery is, but with the failing infrastructure in Texas many people have chosen to go with standby generators. Solar is getting cheaper and I see people installing them as a hedge against rising utility costs, but you can’t utilize solar to power your home without a battery. It’s just hooked straight to the grid. So if the grid goes down, you’re SOL. Home backup batteries cost $16k+ per battery, and $25k plus for an installation that will power your whole home. For me, and a lot of people I’ve talked to, when you get into those prices and you’re investing in something to power your home for 10 years or more you tend to start caring about manufacturers, battery chemistry, amp hours, total number of discharges to reach 80% capacity, etc."

2021-05-22 20:12:23,wallstreetbets,I am going to circle back on this post next week.
2021-05-22 22:36:29,wallstreetbets,Provocative
2021-05-23 06:25:13,wallstreetbets,RemindMe! 30 days
2021-05-23 08:48:02,wallstreetbets,Why not take profits on Tuesday? It was obviously downhill from there.
2021-05-22 22:53:15,wallstreetbets,Luckily he only has 1.  The 20’s is where it could pay but still I wouldn’t make that bet.
2021-05-23 18:21:57,wallstreetbets,Who could have seen this coming?
2021-05-23 04:13:47,wallstreetbets,It helps that theyre extremely cheap.
2021-05-22 23:30:56,wallstreetbets,"volatility play probably , or someone yoloing a shit ton"
2021-05-22 20:58:37,wallstreetbets,"Not necessarily. You always have the ability to roll options contacts down the road. Might cost a little more money, but this IS going to hit eventually and you'd make all that back."

2021-05-22 20:28:44,wallstreetbets,What? If you think there is going to be a short squeeze without a gamma ramp you're crazier than I am
2021-05-23 00:24:18,wallstreetbets,Says who. I love otm leaps.
2021-05-22 20:07:35,wallstreetbets,yeah im big dumb
2021-05-23 08:48:34,wallstreetbets,"oh i did, i took profits and got into this retarded position"
2021-05-22 21:05:29,wallstreetbets,💀 lol yea he’s fuk
2021-05-22 21:00:16,wallstreetbets,"I bought 100 shares when it dipped down a while back. I know it’ll go up (and has) since then, and selling those covered weeklies is easy cash."
2021-05-22 20:05:35,wallstreetbets,That really just means there were a lot of idiots who don’t understand options
2021-05-23 08:53:16,wallstreetbets,"It's just a lottery ticket. $34.50, I don't think it's a make or break situation."
2021-05-23 10:13:21,wallstreetbets,"Keep feeding thetagang or more likely, market makers"
2021-05-23 08:53:58,wallstreetbets,You don’t think amc will squeeze?
2021-05-23 10:47:09,wallstreetbets,"Not a true ape, I bet you don't even eat crayons."
2021-05-23 17:44:17,wallstreetbets,Lol sure
2021-05-23 17:43:38,wallstreetbets,"Lol, u seem like a desperate hf.  Yes we will burn the market down because its a fraudulent market.  2008 is the floor as the ceiling is 100k."
2021-05-22 21:16:03,wallstreetbets,Use stop losses incase of falls
2021-05-23 10:16:20,wallstreetbets,I think this is great. They are adding liquidity to the market.
2021-05-23 10:19:23,wallstreetbets,"You mean it wont increase 1,000% or 100,000% and have a market cap of 100+ trillion? It’s what people who think they are smart but are pretending to be dump keep saying"
2021-05-22 20:09:10,wallstreetbets,If you want to gamble on retarded strikes at least push the date out to 2023 and collect the IV increases
2021-05-23 08:53:18,wallstreetbets,"Solid, shoot for the stairs, you'll end with ankles broken."
2021-05-22 22:41:04,wallstreetbets,Sounds genius. Run me through some ball park numbers if you've got a minute. Buying 100 shares would cost roughly $1200 and how much does selling a ridiculous 1 or 2 week $40 call net you?
2021-05-22 23:10:35,wallstreetbets,126000 idiots? big players in here...
2021-05-23 11:06:07,wallstreetbets,"I'm not suggesting to waste money on options, but for people who do, there are ways to extend those expiring OTM contacts without throwing all their money away."
2021-05-23 11:07:42,wallstreetbets,"It already squeezed and *hasn't fully retracted from those levels yet*.

Market cap isn't an utterly meaningless statistic, despite what you've been poorly informed.

Also, the value of those open shorts matter. Also, who holds them, matters. Also, who lent those shares, matters.

There are too many uncertainties about it.

...

Which is why betting *on the company* would be a way to reduce that risk.

The company was being run into the ground and has made **zero** significant decisions to steer course away from the ground.

They still have debts, somehow. How can a company increase the float thriugh offerings on the market by 10x in 12-18mths and STILL have debt.

Jesus."
2021-05-23 06:44:30,wallstreetbets,I bought at 36¢ and sold at 90¢ 96 contracts easy money.....can u post pics in comments?
2021-05-22 20:09:50,wallstreetbets,yeah I've learned my lesson the hard way.
2021-05-23 10:11:02,wallstreetbets,"These are so insanely otm and cheap. If you think a squeeze is coming, go for it. This is too big brain play for me"
2021-05-23 11:37:44,wallstreetbets,Remind me in 30 days to talk about it.
2021-05-23 10:11:53,wallstreetbets,"It only cost me $225 for 5 calls, I’m rollin dice"
2021-05-22 20:15:09,wallstreetbets,Wait so that is financial advice?
2021-05-22 20:25:02,wallstreetbets,In no shape or form financial advice . I'm just saying I've got a large part of my portfolio in it. Dont take it then at least time stamp it so I can look fucking brilliant 2 weeks from now
2021-05-22 20:55:46,wallstreetbets,You look extremely brilliant already!
2021-05-22 23:29:07,wallstreetbets,Fast forward 2 weeks
2021-05-23 09:11:02,wallstreetbets,What broker is this?
2021-05-23 10:49:06,wallstreetbets,4k is a yolo? Lmao
2021-05-23 15:16:57,wallstreetbets,"Still holding? I started buying at 36 and did dollar cost avg. Then gave up, ran with 3% profit. Better than a loss. Had 100k worth of stonk."
2021-05-23 09:57:20,wallstreetbets,E*TRADE
2021-05-23 10:49:54,wallstreetbets,It was 7k and its a lot of money for me lmao
2021-05-23 07:27:52,wallstreetbets,"To be fair, it was over-hyped and over bought (along with many other growth stocks). The current price is attractive for long term investors..  but I'd stay away from this from a swing traders perspective"
2021-05-22 20:06:00,wallstreetbets,Put on ARKK to get package deal. Can't go tits up
2021-05-22 21:08:31,wallstreetbets,"Back over 300 in June, 325 in fact."
2021-05-22 20:26:01,wallstreetbets,Its value is not tied to the value of coins but number of transactions
2021-05-23 14:08:11,wallstreetbets,Higher chance of it shooting above $350 than it continuing to drop much lower than where it's in the 220's.
2021-05-22 22:57:34,wallstreetbets,Every time COIN drops I buy the dip. 4 times so far I've bought the dip. I'm ready for another 400 dips ... COIN aint going anywhere
2021-05-22 23:51:16,wallstreetbets,Lmao 500 PE? They made 3.06 EPS last quarter. And they make profits on trading volume/volatility soooooo
2021-05-23 01:26:06,wallstreetbets,Worst stock of 2021
2021-05-23 01:16:05,wallstreetbets,"Sounds like a hedgefund speaking. 

I’m buying some of this Monday"
2021-05-23 05:18:12,wallstreetbets,"Coin to me definitely isn’t worth the price on the board but shorting it is really dangerous. The stock might still go up a lot, it’s just to volatile to short it. Buying puts however might still be a great option but I don’t know if you can buy Coin puts lasting longer than a couple of months."
2021-05-23 03:42:53,wallstreetbets,I played at 380 lol cut loss tho. But I lost a Fuk ton.
2021-05-23 14:08:58,wallstreetbets,"That's not a fomo, this is a fomo 395."
2021-05-23 09:22:44,wallstreetbets,Just wait for lock up to end. Extra spicy.
2021-05-23 15:54:13,wallstreetbets,"Yes, but the commission they charge is a percentage of the coin, so if it's going down it's a lower dollar value. This causes some weird dynamics in their earnings when coin price moves. They also can't avoid some exposure to the coins, so, it's complicated I guess. 

In general I would think that more trading volume would be good for them."
2021-05-22 20:59:27,wallstreetbets,There are alternatives that dont rape you with a broken beer bottle on fees.
2021-05-23 10:23:45,wallstreetbets,"Yes, $coin is already so beat down it’s due for a bear destroying dead cat bounce."
2021-05-22 20:32:54,wallstreetbets,"It's a percentage of the transaction. When you sell for $50,000 they make $250, when you sell for $20,000 they make $100"
2021-05-23 03:41:49,wallstreetbets,Which isn't sustainable because people will forget about this craze eventually and the volume will go back to what it was a year ago
2021-05-23 06:38:16,wallstreetbets,Mara worse
2021-05-23 03:23:59,wallstreetbets,Wait for Robinhood IPO
2021-05-23 04:19:52,wallstreetbets,"Well, this has definitely aged well. Feel bad for the guy who sold me 3 puts for 222.5 expiring 28 May for like $600 each on Friday"
2021-05-22 20:36:34,wallstreetbets,"It can only grow if people want to trade, if the underlying crashes because nobody wants to buy, then the volume will be fairly low and the price will be low"
2021-05-23 14:51:46,wallstreetbets,When is the lockup actually?
2021-05-22 21:25:46,wallstreetbets,Coinbase is ass. Coinbase Pro is purty good.
2021-05-22 21:47:14,wallstreetbets,All you gotta look at is volume and borrow % to know they're fine. But price discovery can be fake for a long time.
2021-05-23 09:42:07,wallstreetbets,"And we have a huge swath of new investors that just recently got into coins and are getting burned, a lot of them won't be coming back."
2021-05-23 16:48:46,wallstreetbets,There is no lockup period. They did a direct listing not an IPO
2021-05-23 03:45:15,wallstreetbets,Coinbase pro charged me 0.50% even though I traded more than 10K and closed my support ticket
2021-05-22 20:35:00,wallstreetbets,"I think it will get to $100, but if any previous bubbles are indication, it can overshoot on the low side when going down to $50"
2021-05-23 12:40:15,wallstreetbets,Mans is upset over .5% go back to robinhood ape where they will fuck you you guaranteed
2021-05-23 19:14:05,wallstreetbets,"0.5% is several thousand dollars in my case

Do you even trade?"
2021-05-22 20:33:10,wallstreetbets,Whoa.. thanks... do I get taxed on the gains though?
2021-05-22 23:41:35,wallstreetbets,What is “gains”?
2021-05-22 20:40:18,wallstreetbets,Of course.
2021-05-23 05:04:35,wallstreetbets,I think it's when the color changes from red to green maybe?  Something about a + sign somewhere. 🤔
2021-05-23 03:08:41,wallstreetbets,"I read a lot of thoughts and opinions posted here, until I stopped. 

OP laid out the only facts, when inflation happens, you get out of money cause of fear of not knowing how quickly inflation rises. Commodities may get the best boost, but stocks do not crash when inflation happens. They go up as they did in turkey. The circulating FUD is to steal our stocks cheap before the rocket up"

2021-05-23 09:15:14,wallstreetbets,"Inflation ain’t happening, broski. Just a temporary bump from the last effects of the stimmy checks, tax returns, and unemployment bene’s. Those plus some bottlenecks on supply chains causing artificial shortages."
2021-05-22 21:06:40,wallstreetbets,7% CD? Omg
2021-05-23 08:00:33,wallstreetbets,100% agree. Rates cannot be allowed to rise fast enough to tame inflation. We have to eat the shit sandwich of 5% inflation for a few years.

2021-05-23 07:39:52,wallstreetbets,"Inflation is here since some time. [Dollar Inflation Curve](https://inflationdata.com/Inflation/Inflation_Rate/CurrentInflation.asp?reloaded=true)

Please see the link for some insight.

Additionally, we got asset and goods prices rising - thats inflation too. The FED confirmed (i think?) over 3% a couple months ago too. The real inflation rate probably is a bit higher, depends on what prices you measure.

With ETF buying, it usually is the best way to DCA an amount you are comfortable spending every week/month. That way you dont need to worry 24/7 and can still save some money in an ok asset. Are the prices right now overvalued? I dont know unfortunately."

2021-05-23 09:14:20,wallstreetbets,"they'll book it as 3%-4% using the usual ""reclassification"", but somewhere in the lower mid single digits for actual inflation sounds right to me

i'd say 3%-5% will be the new bound for actual inflation, 2%-4% for the official massaged numbers"
2021-05-23 03:24:43,wallstreetbets,I’m absolutely retarded but even I’m fixed at 2.75%
2021-05-23 07:25:38,wallstreetbets,"Tech had a dip.

Everything looks a little expensive though.

Invest 10% every month if you are worried about corrections. Don’t go all in immediately."
2021-05-23 07:40:57,wallstreetbets,"Wanted to say: asset and commodity prices rising\*, goods prices obv is inflation.."
2021-05-22 20:34:07,wallstreetbets,See deez nuts gottem
2021-05-23 10:33:47,wallstreetbets,"Don’t worry about it. Buying VOO is better than having cash in the bank. I bought CVX expecting inflation. If the price of everything goes up, the earnings goes up with it. Always have a good amount stashed in gold bullion though. They say 10% of your portfolio should be gold but for me 10oz seems like enough. If you’re scared of inflation gold is supposed to be good to hedge inflation. Or companies that benefit from inflation like chevron or mining companies, the only one that really gets fucked from inflation is retail, manufacturing should like inflation."
2021-05-23 08:01:38,wallstreetbets,I don’t know a single person with a variable rate. Why would you when long term ultra-cheap fixed rates are easy to obtain?
2021-05-23 07:27:06,wallstreetbets,Sounds good thanks!
2021-05-23 06:13:12,wallstreetbets,Lots of commercial real estate mortgages have much shorter terms.

2021-05-23 09:18:12,wallstreetbets,I see.  Thanks for the info.
2021-05-23 03:45:47,wallstreetbets,"Who cares, either way it seems like a good play. I just love that the chances of being a millionaire are more than zero, but I know it's still a lot less than one"
2021-05-23 03:47:42,wallstreetbets,Ur right imo. It can go to $1k tho.
2021-05-23 18:41:25,wallstreetbets,">How can we know this for sure? The NYSE literally cannot quote stock prices that high. Furthermore, the SEC and politicians literally think it is their job to reduce market volatility. When Gme went to $300 the White House got involved, there is no way they will let it go to $10,000 - much less $10,000,000.

Well, BRK-A is currently approximately $430,000/share so it can go to at least six digits. What makes you think it can't go higher?

>Think about it: would any president allow the economy to crash over a video game company? 

I'm pretty sure there's a lot of DD on this already saying even at a 1m/share payout, the overall economy would be just fine.

You do you. I don't think it'll go to 10m/share either but I don't think you're talking from any place of knowledge."
2021-05-23 13:33:53,wallstreetbets,Why even post this? If you're gaining so much why do you choose to brag and imply giving financial advice? Take your gains and go
2021-05-22 20:37:19,wallstreetbets,You're either a gullible idiot or one of the guys telling everybody else to hold so that *you* can sell at the top. 🤡
2021-05-22 20:43:17,wallstreetbets,"The good old ""oh shit I can't refute this. Uh, uh, okay I better try to discredit the account!""

You literally just went with ""new account"" and ""if they say it's not FUD then it's FUD!!1!"".

You're pretty much exactly who this post is warning about: the guys taking advantage of noobs to dump your bags on them.

(Or I suppose you could just be one of the cultists. Not sure which is worse)"
2021-05-22 20:39:54,wallstreetbets,So what illegal practice do you guys think is happening now? And (more importantly) what do you have supporting that conclusion?
2021-05-22 21:39:43,wallstreetbets,And you must be one of those fucking morons that cannot do simple math.
2021-05-22 20:51:28,wallstreetbets,"Yes, you have fallen for your own FUD... YOU went on the defensive before you even knew what you wrote. You are writing stupid shit that no one with a brain believes, but you tell everyone up front that ""I am right and if you disagree you are a bag holder.""

You are laughable.

Believe what you want. I don't care. Neither do the others. You're looking for attention. Call upstairs to mommy. She'll bake you some more hot pockets.

Bye now.

The funniest part of this is that you don't have any idea what I think, but you are somehow a soothsayer, sage, and can tell my thoughts before I even think them.

You're a joke. When you preempt a counter argument, you lose all credibility. You are admitting you have a flawed argument before you even start. That's kind of pathetic. Saying ""if you disagree"" before hand is so fucking lame. Can't you see that?

If you had a valid case you wouldn't need to call others out. And yes, you're a 3 month old account with no credibility.

Bye now."
2021-05-23 03:48:18,wallstreetbets,You’re right I agree. Those who down votes don’t understand the severity.
2021-05-22 22:02:03,wallstreetbets,Oh yeah? Which math did you do that I apparently missed? You gonna link me to another rambling DD based on conspiracy theories?
2021-05-22 21:27:56,wallstreetbets,"Lol. Definitely option 2 then. You're a fucking braindead cultist.

It doesn't exactly take much to read what you think based on your comments, considering you either don't know what FUD means or you just prefer to stick your fingers in your ears.

Screeching ""FUD FUD FUD!!1!"" if anyone says anything you don't like, thinking everyone is out to get you rather than the simple truth: you fell into massive groupthink and now you're desperate to drag more people into your cult because otherwise it might fall apart and you'd have to confront the truth. 

If you weren't such a giant prick I might have pitied you."

Has anyone updated an estimated outstanding shares count."
2021-05-23 09:13:32,wallstreetbets,Nope its called supply and demand math that simple hope that helps.
2021-05-23 02:20:51,wallstreetbets,"This is what I wanna know as well. All this talk of diluting to pay off debt and invest in digital, but outstanding shares are barely moving. How do you interpret this?"
2021-05-23 14:21:07,wallstreetbets,"Ah yes.

Clearly your claim that the market would suddenly have no legitimacy if the government got involved (because clearly it's not like there's already an entire government agency specifically dedicated to being involved already) is all based on simple math.

Right...."

2021-05-22 21:03:49,wallstreetbets,I got rid of my puts when they dropped in the $9s on Friday.  At this point it would feel like kicking a wounded animal.
2021-05-23 13:33:24,wallstreetbets,"Was super bullish on RIDE until all of Fords stuff came out this week. Was going to be tough ok Lordstown without that kind of competition, now it’s going to be even tougher"

2021-05-23 13:38:48,wallstreetbets,"Ulta because the yearlong pandemic pajama party is about to end and people return to situations where cosmetics are used (work, etc)"
2021-05-23 15:02:50,wallstreetbets,"Costco seems risky. It ran up big during COVID because they were the go-to money sink for people's food and non-discretionary budgets. 

With restaurants being shut down people cooked at home much more and spent almost all of their budget at places like COST out of necessity.

That's reversing now and my hunch is the market will price in that spend getting reallocated back to restaurants + eating out especially in the next few months when people are dying to get out and celebrate."
2021-05-23 19:50:59,wallstreetbets,Somehow I suspect this is priced in

2021-05-23 08:57:32,wallstreetbets,"Or possibly they may go up due to higher costs of doing your taxes, when you bought and sold stocks. Perhaps all these new investors will have paid more to do their taxes? I believe most of the people that use Intuit, file earlier btw. Just my opinion."
2021-05-23 11:01:49,wallstreetbets,Glad I saw this because I was thinking about buying calls
2021-05-22 22:12:55,wallstreetbets,GME on Thursday 27 is missing
2021-05-23 15:16:09,wallstreetbets,"Inflation usually means rate increases to ""slow down"" the economy, but we're in a weird place where rates need to stay low otherwise the market will freak out and it will cripple any recovery.

It will freak out regardless, but less so if it's done when the economy is back on track and unemployment is low again. The Fed has also said they want to let inflation run to get it back closer to their target avg of 2%

Market is forward looking, so basically inflation concerns mean people will flee stocks that will be hurt by eventual higher rates. If the concerns are big enough it will bring the entire market down near-term as people flee to ""safe"" hedges like precious metals. It's like a self-fulfilling prophecy, people fear everyone freaking out and dumping, so they try to be the first to freak out and dump."
2021-05-23 11:03:36,wallstreetbets,You'd have better luck going to Las Vegas and asking the homeless for blackjack strategies

2021-05-23 00:48:45,wallstreetbets,"Well, if you updated your priors based on results from the past weeks, then I think anticipating a pull back after earnings is more likely than not. At that point, you can swoop in and buy, then ride it through the split."

Fastly, SPCE, Opendoor, a lot of great growthy names were strong targets for ER puts and NVIDIA might go that way, but with the super-recent outperformance of semi's (and NVDA is currently considered a Rested Champion) the infrastructure bill, and the split, it really feels like a gamble. Especially with 8% expected move compared to 3.5% average, long puts are a tougher way to play the downside than, say, a credit spread."

2021-05-23 13:32:58,wallstreetbets,"If you have options trading approved (I believe Level 1 for TD Ameritrade) and you want a good way to enter any of these positions, a cash secured put is a good way to do it. Read into how puts work, but basically its a right but not obligation to purchase 100 shares at an agreed upon price that is below the current price. You would pick a strike price below the current price and write a cash secured put (with enough money to purchase the stock if it were to get exercised). If the price doesn't hit the strike price, you keep the premium. If the price does go below the strike price, you got the stock on a discount. Then you could hold the stock or write covered calls above the price you purchased the stock and either keep the premium or get exercised and do it all again. It's called ""the wheel"" and you can read more into it."

2021-05-22 21:39:08,wallstreetbets,"I am on the other side of this trade as I can read a weekly chart ... now the Monthly chart is broken and you guessed ... points to $420. Never buy naked options. Even when I became very bearish on TSLA I bought the $580 and sold the $550 PUT when TSLA tagged $666 the second time. This stock is a rigged as it gets and I have traded it for 10 years. It will give you signals like $666 that really help along with the charts. Better luck next time. I cashed my spread and doubled my money. On FRIDAY I bought a more narrow closer dated $575 $560 spread for May 31st expiry. Lesson here is ... when your option plan is to double your money... make sure you cash out if it loses 50% so you still have coin to play with. If it drops 50% you can safely say to yourself ""I AM WRONG""  Stay safe, and good luck trading."
2021-05-22 21:46:21,wallstreetbets,I’d hold. 🍻
2021-05-22 21:49:14,wallstreetbets,You my friend just learned a very expensive lesson. Just be more mindful of risk/reward. I hate options tbh and rather just buy a bunch of shares

2021-05-23 00:06:20,wallstreetbets,You really just need to buy another 5 contracts get that average down and buy another 5-10 behind that if it gets even worse. That average is out of control.

2021-05-23 01:48:22,wallstreetbets,Ask Musk to tweet something positive. You'll make money. The algorithm is following his tweets. It's a difference between working at Wendy's and owning a lambo.

This is the part I don't get. The value seems to have a disconnect from share price that i can never find explained or tracked with options.

Are you able to clear that part up? Id appreciate finally being able to understand this part of things."
2021-05-22 20:46:22,wallstreetbets,You mean donating art that has incredibly high speculative value while it doesn’t really add value to a museum? 250 million dollar painting given away looked like shit anyways

2021-05-23 06:33:08,wallstreetbets,"Because they are out of the money and due to less time and in regards to volatility the probability that they will be in the money is now very unlikely, therefore the options are now worth significantly less.

Go on YouTube and find out about options. They seem complicated and scary but they really are not, if you understand the principles and the greeks."
2021-05-22 20:12:08,wallstreetbets,That is correct.  You can use the carryover against the whole 10k you got.  You'd have to pay tax on the remaining 3
2021-05-22 23:45:04,wallstreetbets,It is a thing
2021-05-23 00:58:49,wallstreetbets,In Canada you can only apply capital losses to capital gains. That’s it. Carry back is 3 years and carry forward indefinitely. Can be applied (at 50%) to other income only at death of the taxpayer.
2021-05-23 09:15:23,wallstreetbets,Sure they have. They lose it all on thre next play that doesn't work out. They'd have money left over if they'd only held those winners longer.
2021-05-23 00:01:09,wallstreetbets,"The difference is that someone who already lost 68k is going to be fine losing another 1k.

However, selling it now and then seeing TSLA soar past the strike price would be devastating, much more so than not buying. Yes, it shouldn't in theory, but human brains work this way and it's worth to acknowledge it.

I'd ride that train straight into the abyss."
2021-05-23 13:27:26,wallstreetbets,Plenty of six figure accounts on here. Just a lot of them stay quiet.

I've no idea where those numbers come from, how to see them changing, or why they are like that.  I figure someone on here can actually provide an explanation.  Most videos completely gloss over or skip how those numbers are arrived at.  Like, why 1.97 and not the actual share price. It makes no sense to me at all."
2021-05-23 00:49:49,wallstreetbets,"Not the accountant WSB deserves, but the one they need"

2021-05-23 09:12:58,wallstreetbets,"To be fair, most information you get on youtube is shitty, because usually they try to sell you something and giving out all the information would hurt their business model.

If you want to learn on a topic, you need to read books and get practical experience. So far I can really recommend ""The idiots guide to options trading"" and ""The options traders hedge fund"" (if you aim for theta gang style plays).

There even is ""Trading Options for Dummies"". Nevermind what you choose, in the end you have to read and work to understand them, watching a few videos will not help you much. Also a lot of experience will come from trading options and really feel the pain and panic that they can generate in you.

Dont go all in, try to get your feet wet with as less money as possible, but start practicing on the job."
2021-05-23 14:50:22,wallstreetbets,"When you buy options you don’t actually own the stock. You’re buying a contract for 100 shares of the stock at a certain price with an expiration date. Every day that goes by, the contract loses value. This is why they are way more risky and you see people either losing or gaining a lot of money. People who buy the actual shares won’t gain as much and have to spend more, but the risk is much less because they own the shares. Options are like gambling."
2021-05-22 23:38:13,wallstreetbets,Would that include gains from day trading?
2021-05-23 09:17:18,wallstreetbets,Well this is the closest to answering this question that anyone's got so... thanks.

2021-05-23 13:04:09,wallstreetbets,What did you do 😱 ?
2021-05-23 13:18:50,wallstreetbets,"Beginning of March got in with RKT and quickly made well over $100K (had realized $120K by 3/2), but rolled out a bunch to new positions in RKT and bought a ton of UWMC (using a mix of profits from RKT plus some other money). Basically overnight the carpet got pulled and my RKT positions ended up netting me about $40K in gain and I was down on UWMC about $80K, for a net loss between the two of $40K.

I have lost money on other trades but never like this where I got caught up in a quick squeeze and came out so behind."

2021-05-23 00:48:12,wallstreetbets,The best part is the company was laden with debt when they were trading at $8 and there was much more uncertainty about the plant being built at that time compared to what institutional investors will see when Souki announces long term agreements!

2021-05-23 03:45:47,wallstreetbets,Is GME still a hot stock. It doesn't seem to go up. One day goes forward and the next goes back in reverse. It doesn't make sense such a hype

2021-05-22 21:51:02,wallstreetbets,Bro Wtf? How is GME not the most overinflated stock in the market?
2021-05-23 12:57:44,wallstreetbets,Are you saying you have all your stock purchases in one company?   I think the saying is good advice.  Whenever I’ve thought a company stock was all it and put a large funding into it- it crashes!   I can name examples....
2021-05-23 08:32:24,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for your positivity.
I hope this happens soon!
I'm holding"

2021-05-23 13:03:02,wallstreetbets,True but that initial squeeze is what drew major attention to it which brought in a large number people who bought the stock. It has maintained that $150-$175 for a while now because people continue to buy etc but from my understand most of the shorts are gone and there won’t be another catalyst to significantly drive up the price like we initially saw.  I think it will continue to remain sub $200 and likely never pass it again. This is still a very high stock price for a floundering dying company.

2021-05-23 04:28:43,wallstreetbets,Yea we can vote but we wont truly know how much shares we got. That way if we add all our shares and it equals 50 million or something then we would know how much would be left and how much would have to be covered and we could actually make some noise and force them to cover if thats the case.

2021-05-22 20:21:32,wallstreetbets,"You'll need a level 2 account. Once you have options (covered calls) enabled, you can go to your trading interface, select option chains and find your desired exit point. Look across a number of dates. The further out you go, the more the premium is, but also the higher the likelihood that the stock moves in such a way that your call is executed and you sell your shares. Select sell to open, a number of contracts equal to the number of hundreds of shares you own, and then place the order.

Note: you should do a lot of research around option trading: selling covered calls above your cost basis will never lose you money, but could cause you to miss out on major moves of the underlying, at which point you have to either roll your call out, ideally collecting premium along the way, or let your shares get called away and buy back in.

None of this is financial advice, but it is the next level of market manipu... err, trading that you can do while you hold onto shares you never plan to sell."

The market is about to fall on its face so most portfolios are gonna get trashed.  i will trust my GME and risk it there.

Except instead of the ice age, people keep going back to 2008.  Except 2008 was involving different elements of its collapse, so even that is a poor model.

Ladies and gents I think we could be on the verge a global change.  I’d suggest having some bottled water and canned spam along with a week of kerosine for heating and a solar powered freezer to make ice from water you condense during morning dew (sorry for the desert folks!).

2021-05-23 10:36:54,wallstreetbets,"1. Nobody knew they were going to fly this weekend. During the earning call they said VMS was having issues and they were going to take the time they needed to fix it, giving no dates. Hence the sell-off after earnings to 14$.

2. People were betting against and for the completion of the flight. Nobody can predict the outcome of a successful test flight. Thus is not a sell the news event because the “news” could have gone either way. It’s like when you bet on a baseball team to win. You don’t know if the team will win or not.

3. Those in the know on VG know that they will be conducting several more test flights over the summer. The final one with Richard Branson, the real money honeypot. Envision every test flight as a step of stairs. After this flight it will stabilize somewhere. Before the next one it will stabilize somewhere and move up before the flight as people place their bets. Just like this time. It can go either way, hell, if there is a catastrophe the stock could plummet to 0 which makes it so lucrative for the shorts.

4. Hopefully your peabrain understands that this will moon tomorrow."

2021-05-22 23:32:50,wallstreetbets,"Yes, Beavers got me. It was a ban bet but he was kind and let me off after a week or so."
2021-05-22 23:31:24,wallstreetbets,For you

2021-05-23 00:17:56,wallstreetbets,Lmao
2021-05-23 00:39:18,wallstreetbets,Are you lonely
2021-05-23 01:24:09,wallstreetbets,All facts. Well put.
2021-05-23 02:56:53,wallstreetbets,Sounds about right - only problem is the 100% brainless UK pleb population don't seem to have NOTICED yet.  They think Britain still 'rules the world' etc etc (they still haven't noticed King Arthur died defeated on a battlefield). Every seriously wealthy UK citizen has their business registered in the Cayman Islands and lives on one of their private yachts in the Med. The only rich UK citizens living in London are Russian mobsters who bought UK passports to get their Putin cash out. Ho hum.
2021-05-23 02:29:01,wallstreetbets,I think he’s says no that they’ll blame the greedy price hikes and corporate greed on inflation and rake in lots of dough.
2021-05-23 04:00:10,wallstreetbets,"If you look at the London stock market they seem to do about three deals a day total .. as far as I can see.. was too boring for me - stocks are either 5  a penny or a thousand quid a share.  But can be I'm wrong, I didn't hang around a lot. EU is much more interesting. eg Euronext. Make or break stuff  there, all kinds of deals, talks, financing, directions, mergers, tech .. plenty DD. Not instant-fortune hysteria USA meme stocks, but good investments and also fair daily opportunities. IMO."
2021-05-23 12:55:45,wallstreetbets,"This, each broker has different rules and within each of those broker’s rules there’s usually something where “this can change at any time”. Also different amounts of margin certainty has different rules. A million at TD is going to be much different than 100k at TD. Generally they allow larger accounts more time to meet maintenance requirements before liquidation and other perks like lower requirements and cheaper interest."
2021-05-23 13:16:05,wallstreetbets,🦋🦋🍆?
2021-05-23 14:33:51,wallstreetbets,"That's what I was thinking, they seem to be completely divorced markets."

Women have hundreds of men begging to either fuck or buy us dinner on tinder with zero effort from ourselves.  We log in and just browse the buffet, and pick what we want.

Bumble makes us actually do all the work, why the fuck would any of us want to use that app."

2021-05-23 11:15:03,wallstreetbets,"You call it a dip, but to me it's still roughly a 25% gain. This stock can do me no wrong."
2021-05-22 20:38:30,wallstreetbets,"Lion Electric is my favorite growth stock. They have enormous potential with smart management, over a decade of building products and positioning themselves, great partnerships, excellent customers (Amazon, IKEA, etc), and on and on. They’re still largely unknown, flying under the radar and severely undervalued. By next week, I’ll have $40K invested which is my largest position. A 10x return over the next 3-5 years is very achievable with the path they’re on. I’m confident they’ll execute as they’ve planned."
2021-05-23 08:43:16,wallstreetbets,"First student ordered 240 buses, but first student alone has 43,000 yellow school buses in America .  Lion makes garbage trucks, there are 63,000 garbage trucks in America.

So that’s School Buses and Garbage Trucks.  Environmental thinking means both of these will go all electric eventually.  Lion also makes large minibuses as well.  Now then Amazon with their 20% of the business option through warrants, and what about IKEA..now they are delivery trucks..think about how many there are of those...staggering potential market size.

I’ve been in since NGA, and they got caught up in the big SPAC selloff.  I’ve averaged down, and I’m almost at parity, with now my biggest position.  I don’t believe there is a better Risk/Reward play in the market right now.  Anyway..DYOR and all that."

2021-05-23 05:08:38,wallstreetbets,"I have been comparing schwab vs Robinhood lately, same ticker, try to do same input time(sse on computer vs Robinhood app on iPad), and have noticed they have relatively the same execution time, but my walking orders on schwab will be front run 100% of the time. Meaning, when I tell it to drop 5 cents every 30 seconds and the stock is going up while the option is going down in price while that doesn’t happen to my Robinhood portfolio seems peculiar(I try to physically walk it down on Robinhood and have been doing so with my options for over 9 months). I think the biggest difference is the .65-1.3(1.3-2.6 per option transaction) for each option contract I buy and it doesn’t go down at 100 contracts. They are easily skimming 5-10%+ solely off of commissions in some trades even if I met 100% profit, and that isn’t even including how much money I lose off of payment for order flow scam."

We can start with this one.. you said “Look at the charts” and yet posted none. 

When I said you were only looking at PRICING you did the same type of deflection you are attempting here, and still NEVER gave me a screenshot to the short postiom you were referring to.

Lets just START with “the charts” you were referring to here. I don’t have them. You do? 

Can you post them? If you CANT thats okay. Just say 

“I cant (or wont) post ‘the charts’ I said I had access to, I lied on the internet and / or too stupid to take a screenshot to prove you wrong”

my the first post in this thread regarding charts. I am legit losing braincells fighting this kind of weaponized retardation. January of this year we were at $2. Then came the GME squeeze and AMC squeezed with it. After that it dropped to as low as $5 and sat there for awhile, but STILL it was up from the $2 earlier in the year. Then you can clearly see a uptrend for AMC to the price it is at now, with a very nice support level at $12 currently. 

Like how is this hard to process? Even a fucking 5 year old can clearly see the diffrence of AMC january 1s 2021 to AMC may 23 2021. Honestly, what the fuck other chart do you think im referring to?????"

And the only reason im even talking to you now is quite simple. You are aclown, and im bored. Thanks for the entertainment i guess. Prob the same idiot that also doubted doge back in january.

2021-05-23 02:26:21,wallstreetbets,"I agree with you about covered calls. 

Frankly, I also agree with you about trading options in general. It's important to understand that while stocks can rise across the board in the long run, and most people can ""win"", options really have a 50/50 split (at BEST). It's frankly a gamble in a lot of regards. They may be useful as a risk management tool, for complex investors who use them to hedge, but they seldom make sense as a form of jacking up risk for the average investor. Every option trade has an equal distribution (at best) on both sides of the trade. What I mean by that, is that if you have a 90% chance of a 10% return on one side of the trade, well then you're going to have a 10% of a 100% loss on the other side, to balance things out. There's no free money in options trades.

If you buy Amazon and I buy Johnson and Johnson, we could both make money and both come out ahead. But if there's a Yankees v. Sox game, and I pick Yankees, and you pick Sox, one of us wins and the other one has to lose. We can't both win. If the Yankees are the favorite, then I may be more likely to win, but win less money, and you'd be less likely to win, but you'd have a bigger payout if you did. In the same regard, options trades must balance, and there's a winner and a loser every time."

This is a SPAC bankrolled company with a junior exec at the head of the company.  He does not have the experience to listen to good advice when times get tough.   And the SPAC guys have built up his ego.  He needs to fail to learn.

The long term tend for this stock is down.  Lower lows. These temporary up trends are just that folks who think they found a value stock and buy.  And the sheep keep following...until it is too late to see the clif.

I am not saying this is a bad buy over the long term. I am saying it is too soon too buy.  I am saying that there are less risky alternatives.  The mortgage market is at a peak or past it.  It all depends on the recovery and feeding the market more low interest cash.  And this stock is all about mortgages.  And making money off of fees.  Let me be the one to remind folks about the last crazy in the mortgage market...AIG, CountryWide, CDOs, Wells Fargo.  Do not put your hard earned cash into this stock.  It does not have a track record that indicates it is a growth stock with a moat.

2021-05-22 23:19:00,wallstreetbets,"Ok, so at one point in the last week it was trading at 15 a share. If you adjust for market cap and share dilution, AMC should be trading at 5 dollars a share.

Now, there is a big caveat to that. The 5 dollars a share is reasonable if they are at their best profit and revenue levels ever. 5 dollars a share is justified if that is the case, 9therwise 5 a share is OVERVALUED


Ok real talk. Please do a lot of research before actively trading. Claiming that it is undervalued based on its volume is similar to me saying airplanes fly because sometimes there is a blue suitcase on the plane. May get lucky with amc, but eventually it will catch up to you.

Also quick note, AMC going up doesn't mean it was undervalued either. There are many forces at play. AMC could go to 50 or higher on a squeeze. But it will still come back down"
2021-05-23 09:38:07,wallstreetbets,"Maybe. Cannot really say. It does seem rather premature.

And options won't generally exceed the underlying asset price but that all depends on the IV and volume.  Options don't necessarily go up with price increase... again it simply all depends. With AMC the IV and volume went up so the option pricing increases but won't behave linearly. You cannot blankly state the options will be worth more. That's how folks lose money thinking oh it has to go up. Not necessarily. Probably but there are flukes. I have some options on a stock that it went up over a point and the calls barely moved and, At some points during the day, the option fell when the stock only moved up. Then the stock dropped half a point by close and the calls went up. It is what it is. The Greeks can give guidance"

2021-05-22 23:22:04,wallstreetbets,"Teens if the share dilution didn't happen. Think of it this way. A dollar is worth 4 quarters right? If you dilute the coins (shares) by instead having 20x nickels, each coin isn't magically worth 25 cents, but the valuation is the same.

That is amc. It's share price with dilution should be under 5 a share"
2021-05-22 23:32:05,wallstreetbets,"What are you even talking about?

AMC current shares outstanding is 400 million shares.  That is the listed amount of shares that the company is recorded number of shares.  The recent share dilution that AA put into the market was only 47 million.  That is only 10 percent.

When you realize that on an average day AMC trades 90 million shares.  40 million is nothing.

So, I am not sure how you are getting these insane levels of dilution.  Unless you are talking about illegal shares that have been put into the market.  Shares that are not supposed to exist.  If anything if the value of the stock is only at 12 dollars with all of these unregulated shares.  Then the price is at least double the current price.  Because those shares are not shares put into the market by the company.

So, yea your basically drooling out the side of the mouth right now in my eyes."
2021-05-22 23:47:10,wallstreetbets,"Look at share history. It went from 120ish in early 2020 to 450 now. That's 4x. Prior to 2020, it's high share price was 20 bucks a share.

Share price isn't what matters, market cap, or valuation is what matters. Very important thing to learn. This is why Apple can be worth more than Chipotle despite Chipotle having a higher share price."
2021-05-23 00:02:15,wallstreetbets,"Link it.

I have been following it for a few months and in my history of watching the shares outstanding have gone down.  It was at 450 million at one point.

But, even then it doesn't really matter. If you look at January 27th it traded 1.2 billion shares.  So, I mean maybe you in the past the volume has changed.  But, in the past when it's volume was lower did it trade 1.2 billion shares in one day.

So, I mean I see your argument.  But, it has also increased it's holdings in tangible assets like land and infrastructure.  For some reason it is trading 1.2 billion shares in a day.  It also has 3.5 million individual share holders.

So, your argument is incredibly flawed.  Your saying that it is diluted but at the same time it has more buildings and land.  More share holders and more activity.  You have an argument but it is flawed and it is excluding factors."
2021-05-23 00:13:37,wallstreetbets,"Took 2 seconds to find. https://ycharts.com/companies/AMC/shares_outstanding

Volume is totally irrelevant to valuation. There is no reason to discuss that at all.

You're right, there are additional forces at play. Did AMC purchase or open more locations after the pandemic started? If so, that is relevant. If acquisitions were prior to the pandemic then they arent, as the market had determine that AMC isn't worth more than 5 a share with those holdings.

Now, AMC took out an absurd amount of debt to stay solvent during the pandemic. Did they pay that off with the stock offering? It's feasible, but I don't think they did. I think they just paid a portion off - this pushes it further below the 5 dollars a share level. 

The biggest issue though, is that it is looking like movie theaters may never recover to pre pandemic levels. That is devastating for obvious reasons. Especially since they need to double or triple profits to make current share prices reasonable.

AMC can still be a good trade. I bought 2k shares the week before last and may again this week. As a company though, the share price is trading at a massive premium, eventually it will come back to earth. You can potentially make lots of money on it, but not as a buy and hold investment for the above reason"
2021-05-23 00:24:10,wallstreetbets,">Volume is totally irrelevant to valuation.

How is volume irrelevant?  That is Bullshit.  it is relevant.

Your logic is FUD.

You think movie theaters are not going to recover.  That is FUD.  Anyone that says that is just spreading FUD.

I am not clicking on ycharts I have never heard of that site it is probably a virus.  Because the only message you have is FUD.

How can you think Movie theaters are never going to recover.  They are lifting mask mandates and no one I speak to even cares about this damn virus anymore.  People love going to the Movies.  Why would movies not recover.  Are you trying to say that people dont want to go to the movies.  At home experiences are not better than they were pre pandemic.  2019 was not that long ago.  You think people are just socially trained now after just one year of lockdown?  Your fucking crazy man."
2021-05-23 00:32:56,wallstreetbets,"Lol anything that doesn't support what you think is fud then eh? Movie theaters have been in decline and production companies realized they can get better margins and charge the same or more with streaming the release to people at home.
