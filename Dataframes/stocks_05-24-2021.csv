2021-05-24 19:57:03,stocks,FIFO is the worst IMO. I use lowest cost as a default then manually change after a trade if desired. You can change it between the trade date and the settlement date.
2021-05-24 19:50:26,stocks,"It’s all about how you want your taxes to work. If you bought in at 25 and then 35 and the stock is at 40, selling your first lot would produce a higher capital gains tax than selling the second lot."
2021-05-24 19:44:11,stocks,FIFO JUST TRUST ME
2021-05-24 19:51:47,stocks,"Yeah, cuz i usually pay more per share for my first batch and then buy more on the dip. So the first that sells is the highest paid for."

2021-05-24 19:37:49,stocks,Can i dm u and ask my question?
2021-05-24 19:38:23,stocks,My advice is worth whatever you pay for it.
2021-05-24 19:15:56,stocks,There are a lot of articles about this online. Do a search for how to determine if a stock is over or under valued. You can use online scanners like finviz.com.
2021-05-24 19:09:39,stocks,"I have no idea how Cathy does it, but most people set up a screener on the brokers website enter the criteria your looking for and it pops out the stocks that fit that criteria. Then dig a little deeper into that short list. Good luck"
2021-05-24 19:10:47,stocks,So they set u screeners on stock brokers
2021-05-24 19:16:09,stocks,No you make your own. But most brokers have the tool you just enter in what you want it to look for. Example you pick the sector say a bank the price of stock maybe under $10 profit last qtr above 50% and it will spit out any stocks that match.
2021-05-24 19:16:33,stocks,Whose your broker?
2021-05-24 19:17:59,stocks,What site can i use to do that
2021-05-24 19:17:40,stocks,I dont have one im 16 lol i invest on my dads account using my own money im.trying to find good stock picks only one i have found is a company called guru i tjink its a rly good growth company in the energy drink section check it out
2021-05-24 19:21:38,stocks,"Well when you log in there should be a name. Like schwab TD amiertrade, fidelity. Then you can just Google how to set up a stock screener on (fill in the blank of whatever company it is) I’m sure there instructions online for how to do that specific site. If your using like robinhood or one of the other random ones no idea if they have it I don’t use those exchanges. Good luck"
2021-05-24 19:22:54,stocks,Im on finviz rn on the screener what stocks are usually better value stocks or growth? Growth is when they are undervalued correct?
2021-05-24 19:45:27,stocks,Everybody has their own ideas on what is better growth or value.  Just google growth vs value for definitions internet can explain it way better then me but the short answer is no you have it backwards. Value would be the undervalued ones but that doesn’t mean in the real world the share price will go up more then growth if it was an easy as that everybody would be rich
2021-05-24 19:46:28,stocks,Nvm ik what they are what do investors like warren buffet or cathie woods usually look for value or growth stocks
2021-05-24 19:50:38,stocks,The exact opposite of each other. Buffet in general is a value guy although that could be argued as he has a ton of Apple which in most people’s opinion would be a growth. Cathy is growth for the most part although she might argue she’s buying value at current price. If your looking for high risk high rewards your in general going to want growth if your more of a safe and steady probbably value is your play. Maybe look into ETF’s you can do a little of each growth and value.

2021-05-24 17:40:08,stocks,"most brokers automatically do FIFO because well...that makes sense so the first 100 shares that hit 1 yr will be taxed at LT rate

call your broker if you're not sure"
2021-05-24 17:57:20,stocks,My broker was default FIFO but I switched it to Last in First out. My logic is that I established several positions that are long term and are now well in the money so if I trade around with a new position I don’t want to being selling high what I bought low when I might be holding something for years and therefore deferring taxes.
2021-05-24 19:16:00,stocks,"Taxes aren't necessarily based on first-in, first-out--you can actually choose which shares sell every time you sell.  Most brokers aren't going to directly give you this option, and will default to selling first-in, first-out, though.  Depending on your broker, you may be able to change the default and / or manually choose tax lots to sell through an advanced order page.  Some brokers may not provide many options for that in their apps and sites, and will require you to call them, but all of them will let you choose which tax lot you want to sell if you really want to as far as I'm aware.  Most of the time, FIFO is going to make the most sense, though."
2021-05-24 17:47:00,stocks,"The individual shares sold dictate the cost basis and the tax implications.  If you sell 100 first in first out, and your 100 oldest shares were purchased a year ago, your sale of 100 shares would be long term, even if you just bought 100 more shares, and your cost basis would be based on the shares you sold. 

If you bought 100 shares of XYZ in 2018 for 8 bucks each, and bought 100 more shares last week at 9 bucks each, and now XYZ is at 10 dollars,  and you sold 100 shares first in first out, your cost basis would be 800 dollars and the sale price would be 1000, leaving you with 200 dollars taxable long term gains.  If you wanted to keep your oldest shares for long term gains on dividends, and instead sold your most recent lot of 100 shares, your cost basis would be 900 and you'd have 100 dollars of short term gains (and you'd keep your oldest 100 shares you bought at 8)."
2021-05-24 18:17:16,stocks,"A good broker will let you choose on every trade, like Schwab."
2021-05-24 18:16:56,stocks,"You have a choice to select otherwise.  I have always used first in, first out mainly because it is easier and I don't have complex taxes."
2021-05-24 18:22:01,stocks,I have never done this.  Interesting.
2021-05-24 18:28:26,stocks,I did the same but later changed to lowest cost first out as default. That can manually changed between the sale and settlement.
2021-05-24 18:33:27,stocks,Yes that’s a good point. You can manually change it either direction. I can do it with the IB app I think but it’s been a while since I have.
2021-05-24 17:04:02,stocks,Started my short later in today's trading. $5 stock
2021-05-24 17:03:54,stocks,"You buy 5 shares at $10  
You buy 5 shares at $15  
You have 10 shares at an average of $12.50  
At $20, you sell half your shares, the 5 you bought at $10, netting you $10 profit on each share.  
You now have 5 shares at $15."
2021-05-24 16:57:39,stocks,Are you selling FIFO or by lot?
2021-05-24 17:02:14,stocks,"Each lot of shares that you bought retain their original price.  Your average cost is just that, an average.  When you sell shares you have to specify which shares you want to sell.  Most brokers use FIFO as the default if you did not specify.  That means that you probably sold the first shares you bought which were cheaper and now the remaining shares you have are the more expensive ones.  Your new average is the average cost of your remaining shares not the average of all shares you ever bought."
2021-05-24 16:59:46,stocks,[removed]
2021-05-24 17:03:25,stocks,"Unless you otherwise specific, most if not all brokers do what is called a FIFO or First in First Out when you sell your shares.

That being the case, the 5 shares that you sold were less expensive than the 5 remaining shares, so your cost basis adjusted up to the new range of your remaining shares. If the price of the stock you purchased should happen to fall below your new cost basis, if you buy back in there, your cost basis will go back down. Just be careful when doing so because if the price is close enough to the price of your original position it may be flagged as replacement shares. I hope that helps a little.

Edit:

Hmm you may have triggered the above  mentioned replacement shares, also if you sold at a loss for any one of those 5 shares, and bought back in within 30 days, that triggers a wash sale, so the increase in cost basis, could include a wash sale adjustment"
2021-05-24 17:12:38,stocks,"Check your tax lot, most likely it’s FIFO (first in first out) by default. That means the first ones you buy are the first ones sold in exact order. 

I changed mine to sell lowest cost sold first because if I want to raise a little cash I don’t want to lose money when reducing a position."
2021-05-24 17:32:06,stocks,Kinda depends on timing of the trades and how often you're buying into the same stock
2021-05-24 19:09:32,stocks,Thats odd. My broker just blends the shares and doesnt distinguish between which shares I bought at what price.
2021-05-24 17:01:14,stocks,"^this. The stocks you sold were the first ones you bought (and therefore were not equal to the artificially-created $181/share cost average). 

If the first few you bought were cheaper than the last few you bought, your cost average goes up when you sell some."
2021-05-24 16:58:24,stocks,FIFO most likely
2021-05-24 17:46:59,stocks,"it could be a wash sale situation.. if you unknowingly sold some of those at a loss and bought right back within 30 days, it screws everything up."
2021-05-24 19:33:45,stocks,"not sure which broker you use, but you can usually find the individual costs under ""tax lots"" or something similar.  the averaged cost basis is for your convenience."
2021-05-24 18:24:05,stocks,"Interesting! I had no idea. So if I had sold all my shares, I would have still came out ahead. Some shares would take a loss and some shares would realize a profit and would net out to be a total profit in the end. 

I didn't realize it tracked my buy prices. Didn't figure it mattered. If I acquire a bunch of widgets for various prices, I wouldn't track each individual widget cost but would instead just track how much I have total invested and sell each one at a price that would net a profit when all sold. Thanks for the explanation!"
2021-05-24 17:02:28,stocks,[removed]
2021-05-24 18:25:09,stocks,"I sold the 5 shares this morning and bought 5 shares this afternoon. So all within maybe 5 or 6 hours. 

I'm new to all this....is this not okay?"
2021-05-24 19:13:14,stocks,In this situation maybe you don’t care how much each widget cost but IRS does they want to tax you that’s why it matters
2021-05-24 17:03:44,stocks,[removed]
2021-05-24 18:28:46,stocks,"Look on your investment page and see if there is a 'wash sale' button to turn on or off. I did this on some Walgreen's stock last year where I had sold some, and ended up buying some back but it was within 30 days, so the loss shares averaged in weird on the wash sale rule.

The way i understand is you can buy and sell whenever if you make a gain, but if you take a loss and then turn around and buy a similar lot of the same stock, it does the wash sale adjustment. It is to keep a person from taking a big loss for tax purposes, then buying it back right away."
2021-05-24 16:38:17,stocks,"much lower volume and wide spreads which is bad for trading

however, if there's breaking news (like earning reports), allows for investors to make movements"
2021-05-24 16:44:04,stocks,"Think about going to a store and waiting for it to open at a certain time. Everyone is outside waiting on the doors to open and when it does - there's a massive flood storming in. That can create a lot of chaos.

Pre/post market trading allows for liquidity to slowly enter and exit the market. Once the market opens for real, it's already a flowing stream. 

Trading pre/post market has lower volume and wide spreads. That can be both good and bad for traders. I know a few that take advantage of that low volume and only trade pre-market. Personally, I only close positions in the pre/post because that low volume can screw you over quickly."
2021-05-24 19:22:03,stocks,We are a bunch of pretentious dbags here. We do not use the term stonks...
2021-05-24 16:48:17,stocks,Markets close so settlement can be determined .  After hours trades are considered next day.  Also news occurs after hours and some may or may not choose to trade on the news.  Spread are usually wider and depending on the news volumes can be less
2021-05-24 18:03:52,stocks,"Most companies report their earnings pre-market or after market closes. This allows people to trade in real time while the ER is being reported.

In some cases, people, especially people in Europe or Asia, trade during PM and/or AH because that's pretty much the best time for them to trade. 

But as mentioned, trading PM/AH usually has wider spreads and bigger price swings, which can be good or bad."
2021-05-24 17:05:53,stocks,"Thanks again for this, always appreciated! Can I ask you (and everyone else) your thoughts on the ""value rotation""? I feel like its too late to get into these financials and value stocks as they have rallied massively. I just don't know what to do going forward. Are you still long tech?"
2021-05-24 17:49:47,stocks,Any thoughts on John Deere? Why is currently picking up steam?
2021-05-24 17:15:14,stocks,"Why do you think it's too late to get in?  If you look at pretty much any stock, they have all rallied massively from the March 2020 bottom. If you're going long, ask yourself this, do you really think growth in financial stocks is done for the foreseeable future? If not, then buying an ETF is always a safe way to go

In the long-run, Time in the market always beats timing the market"
2021-05-24 17:50:57,stocks,It's a great company and they demolished earnings last week
2021-05-24 17:21:09,stocks,"I was looking at XLF but it has run up 30% year to date, felt like I could be bag holding at these levels. But my main concern for the financials are the P/E's they are seeing, they are on the more expensive side in regards to their past, I feel like the possibility of interest rates getting higher Is the main reason why these names are running.

Thanks again for your thoughts, may I ask your opinion for the future: would you be bullish on tech, financials or value etfs (from these levels onwards)?"
2021-05-24 17:25:26,stocks,"Im bullish going forward, I see no reason not to be. Why would stocks stop growing now moving forward? 

Also what time frame are you think? An ETF like XLF is meant to be a multi-year hold."
2021-05-24 17:32:14,stocks,"Currently I'm bullish as well but I feel like a lot could disturb the market, like next months CPI report being higher than expected again (even though I also don't expect inflation to be a problem), or the markets not liking one of the reports coming up and being spooked etc. 

I'm also thinking long term but I also depend on some of the money for my living. So I sell covered calls sometimes. Even though XLF had a massive run ytd, I guess I can still average into a position slowly. 

I should have worded my question better, which of these would you prefer the most: tech, financials or value etfs going forward?

Thanks again so much!"
2021-05-24 17:46:44,stocks,"Hmm hard to say which I like more, I own all three in my portfolios as both ETFs and individuals stocks and am bullish going forward. I'd say near-term tech is the most oversold imo.

There will always be potential headwinds, up to us as traders and investors to figure what they are, put them into the broader context of the market, and decide how big is the potential risk. I personally see no headwind that could threaten the bull market soon. Of course there will be volatility and we have to keep an eye on inflation, but I personally am not worried"
2021-05-24 17:49:07,stocks,"very helpful as always, thanks so much!"
2021-05-24 16:32:44,stocks,"Normally 10-20% is good for free cash, however if you aren’t bringing in more money.

2021-05-24 16:54:26,stocks,"2% is not dry powder, If the market dipped or you had an opportunity to find something that was going up 5x, your 2 % investment would only contribute to a 10% gain on the overall .  You need to have real money to put to work if there is a correction. Dry powder I would consider to be 10 % cash at a minimum. That is my opinion"
2021-05-24 18:39:53,stocks,"Traditionally, having more than about 75% of your portfolio in equities is aggressive. If bonds weren't as overpriced as they are, the remainder would constitute those plus some cash. But with rate hikes on the horizon, it's like a game of chicken: Will the hot market tank and take rates with it, making bonds not such a bad idea? Or will rates rise before then, making them a bad hedge? Do the rising rates trigger a selloff? Is it better to go mostly cash and assume eating inflation will pay off in due course through new, less dangerous opportunities to invest?

My rationale is that the markets--stocks, bonds, etc.--are too high temperature to play aggressively unless you know how to safely navigate the waters. The markets are also more leveraged than they have ever been, which means the downside exposure is relatively extreme if the shit hits the fan. I know for a fact that I don't have the experience to invest aggressively right now, so I'm mostly sitting on cash. People say thst risk doesn't factor into the equation at a young age and so any drastic downturns are ultimately transient, but holding cash that deteriorates slowly over time in hopes of a better opportunity in the next 1-2 years is also transient in the long run and far less painful. I'm using these times to practice with an insignificant amount of cash, but still throwing 15% of my income every month into total market funds for retirement."
2021-05-24 16:29:59,stocks,"If I was convinced the market is headed down, why would I hold any positions other than puts or shorts?

I see more upside than downside. But in your case
1) move to less risky/volatile positions and then
2) regardless if you did the above, stay in, just watch it like a hawk with your finger on the sell button. 

You don't need cash yet. 

But who knows how risky your positions are or when you need the cash. I am early middle aged, civilized positions, highly risk tolerant, decades before I need the money."

2021-05-24 18:59:44,stocks,"Adjust dry powder with market valuation.  Pick times in the past where you would have like to be fully invested at market bottoms and fully cash at market tops.  Think of it as a slider where the halfway between those two would be 50% cash, in the bottom quarter of market cheapness you’d be 25% cash, etc.  Find metrics that are consistent at gauging how the overall market is priced.  Use this as a rough guide of how much cash you hold.

With that said, on small accounts there’s almost always enough deals available to be fully invested, even in ultra expensive markets such as this one."
2021-05-24 16:41:59,stocks,"Gotcha. Yeah. I make monthly contributions and will continue to do so, but a measly 2k is nothing to buy dips when my positions are already valued at 100k.

Are people really setting aside 20% in cash right now and just waiting for large hits?...."
2021-05-24 16:57:06,stocks,Thanks for your input. Getting the general consensus that 10-20% cash is an agreed upon range.
2021-05-24 16:35:51,stocks,"Yep, I get that. I don't mess with options trading and I agree that if that was my thing, I would be exploring those types of bets. Mine is much more broad in terms of adjusting my current positions to a bit more cash...and whenever you hear people say to get the powder ready and go more into cash for the short term, no one ever mentions what a typical ratio looks like (not that there is one...but no one ever mentions any ratio).

Was just trying to get an idea to the community's opinion on what a ""dry powder"" hold looks like in terms of their cash:invest ratio."

I do have cash off to the side in a money market account that I can bring in if need be, but wanted to keep it simple in terms of purely looking at the hypothetical 100k that I have in the account atm. Got some answers saying 10-20% is a typical dry powder hold. And I think that's reasonable, but as it stands now, I'll keep contributing monthly like normal and slowly build up the cash in the account a few more % points."
2021-05-24 18:33:16,stocks,"Gotcha. Just the age old question of ""know when to hold em and know when to fold em.""

I have plenty of cash that I can pull into the account if the market tanks hard and I go on an insane buying spree like everyone else, but it's my safety net/rainy months fund, so I've very hesitant to touch it. But I'll weigh those options if my job and cash flow are ever in question. Right now and even with a market crash, I'd be fine to use some of that to capitalize on a market correction/crash."

They won't get rid of streaming, if anything they're going  to war with Netflix, DIS etc. The difference is Amazon has a bunch of different revenue generators so they can take some losses on the streaming side while Netflix cannot. 

I am somewhat surprised that Netflix has not gotten involved in any live broadcasting yet, I thought that should have happened a while ago."
2021-05-24 17:26:21,stocks,Because they need to grow. It's the same reason Apple is getting into cars and credit cards and whatever else. If you stop growing your share price gets badly punished.
2021-05-24 17:11:54,stocks,"Probably to make prime worth it. Without it prime would be much less of a product. The big reason to get prime these days is often the streaming, instead of the free next day delivery.

Plenty of money to be made in films, tv, and entertainment in general. They are also trying to go for live sports, which is huge. I don't see why Amazon can't be the next streaming service everyone has to have."
2021-05-24 16:32:15,stocks,I guess streaming is one of the many reasons to keep the prime members? That is why amazon will not drop it unless it won't bring benefit anymore.

2021-05-24 16:50:02,stocks,"My guess is they think streaming is a relatively new thing and it may look totally different 10 years from now than it looks today.  They may not have a competitive advantage now but who knows what that looks like in a decade or two.  For example, I believe Microsoft lost money on Xbox for a long time and is now just figuring out how to successfully monetize it."

This is also exactly why google bought youtube. They already had the data-center firepower in place because of Google search. It makes too much sense to leverage that for other business purposes."
2021-05-24 17:53:20,stocks,"I agree with your premise. They have AWS and a lot of cash. Though, I'm not sold on the fact that it's an effective use of capital. I may be wrong, but time will tell."

There is a great 3h audiobook on that on Youtube called how to analyse financial statements by Warren Buffett and his student David Clark."
2021-05-24 15:48:51,stocks,"I like Apple very much. They have created such a strong moat with their brand which is really important. With the new M1 chip, the Macs and iPads have gotten a new life. The services segment has so much in store and it will improve Apple’s margins that are already solid. 

Financials are brilliant and they are really good at exceeding expectations from Wall Street. They have a huge warchest of money that they can use to improve the business. This huge pile of money makes their balance sheet healthy. Even dividends are growing if you’re into that.

I have to mention Tim Cook. He’s such a good CEO. He’s worked a long time at Apple and knows the company very well. If the rumours of the EV and VR are true, it makes Apple an even tastier (no pun intended). 

I’m just gonna buy and hold. Simple as that. I’ll get rewarded for that sometime in the future."

2021-05-24 17:18:45,stocks,"From our research, AAPL has accelerating EPS estimates over the past 12 months; its current price level and upward movement is supported by the estimates. Our metric isn’t a predictive indicator if this will continue, only that the current price and trend is supported. If estimates continue to accelerate, the price should follow."
2021-05-24 15:40:07,stocks,"I liked your analysis to be honest so good job. 

It’s a tough one because Apple seems quite pricey at the moment but it’s a market leader with a strong moat and has a lot of potential for innovation. Makes the stock attractive even at a premium."
2021-05-24 18:32:32,stocks,"This place is not a good one for getting a level headed unbiased opinion on AAPL. Too many people preach blindly buying apple and that it's a ""savings account."" There's a lot of forward looking innovation and success already baked into the price, and I never see anyone mention any threats to this company, just MOAT. 

Having said that, I'm not bearish on the company, but there are dips to capitalize on. You just missed the dip."
2021-05-24 17:18:18,stocks,"You don’t take an analyst estimate and then discount it. The estimate is already built from a discounted cash flow model. 

What estimated growth rate and P/E ratio did you use for your future estimated price? You think the largest company in the world is going to double again (from current prices, not your estimate) in 5 years to become a $4 trillion company? From your estimate fair value you think it would triple in 5 years?"

2021-05-24 19:48:27,stocks,"very good job. 

Straight to point, no bullshitting.

I'd like to add that apple has a strong brand, very smart engineers, and their ecosystem is very hard for consumers to ""quit"". (these are good moats). I'm not sure how to valuate these intangible assets, but it reduces my sense of risk, so I'd be willing to pay a premium above my intrinsic value calculation. I'm just not sure how much extra I'd pay; haven't thought about it."
2021-05-24 17:57:16,stocks,"Nica analysis. People have a positive vibe around AAPL and always in the bull camp. But, as investors, we need to stay considering the risk. The problem with Apple is the iPhone unit sold is declining - the growth of both revenue and earnings is due to increase in price rather than volume. Still, I will keep AAPL. Another thing regarding M1 and M2 (M series) processor, it is really interesting to see how this tech could boost Apple revenue other than iPhone."

2021-05-24 17:43:57,stocks,That’s not how analyst expected revenues are built. DCF is a tool used to come up with a fair value of an equity based on its intrinsic value from future cash flows. It’s NOT a tool to come up with analyst estimates for revenue. You have no idea what you’re talking about tbf.

That’s a good point. I’m not sure how much of a premium I would pay either but because it has multiple moats I’m willing to do it more easily.

2021-05-24 14:27:55,stocks,"Increased interest rates have the opposite effect: by raising the Fed rate, the prime rate follows, so it’s a waterfall effect that reduces lending which reduces capital in the economy which deflates the dollar.

Increasing interest rates doesn’t promote spending, it’s a measure taken to remove some money from the pool by making it more expensive and difficult to borrow."
2021-05-24 15:58:23,stocks,"High interest rates means the banks themselves have to raise interest rates on their loans to businesses and individuals. Businesses and individuals are now less likely to borrow money to start a new business or expand their existing business as the rates are less attractive; or for individuals borrowing money for expenditures (cars, house, etc) on credit.

Therefore increasing interest rates decreases the amount banks lend and tightens up/decreases the flow of money. This deflationary effect then also encourages people to save more as the dollar deflates from the interest rate increases"
2021-05-24 15:04:11,stocks,I'm by no means an expert on this but I'm pretty sure the banks don't base their lending rates on how much excess liquidity they have. It's based on the rate the fed charges banks to borrow which in turn is simply determine by the amount of dollars floating around in the system. The Fed looks at inflation/deflation and uses that in part to determine whether or not to raise or low rates. The really question right now is whether inflation is transitory due to pent up demand and limited supply.
2021-05-24 14:39:17,stocks,"Why would they do that when it’s already hard to borrow and they have an excess amount of liquidity? I thought the issue was that people are saving and not spending money. Wouldn’t increasing interest rates only cause people to save more money as they can profit from saving the money? If the government’s goal is to get people to spend or invest money, it only makes sense to me for them to drop rates and cause people to lose money by letting it sit in the bank..."
2021-05-24 16:16:16,stocks,"I’d argue that when demand is low, deflation actually causes inflation by increasing demand to meet the supply instead of artificially making everything more expensive and decreasing the demand."
2021-05-24 15:48:22,stocks,"Banks base their interest rates on the interest rates the federal reserve lends them money at.      

The fed looks at inflation/deflation and the unhealthy rise of commodity prices, while looking at the amount of savings in peoples’ checking accounts, and small businesses need loans that are becoming increasingly hard to come by. The simple answer to all 3 of those seems to be to drop interest rates into the negatives.. China has been controlling the supply of commodities if you didn’t hear their government announcement from last week."
2021-05-24 14:44:40,stocks,"It’s not hard to borrow, though. Money right now is about as close to free as it gets. Interest rates on loans are at historic or near-historic lows. This means lenders and borrowers can afford more risk.

You misunderstand a few things here. It’s not the government’s goal (at least, not directly)...it’s the Federal Reserve, which technically isn’t the government. They’re not concerned with people spending versus investing. They’re concerned with the overall financial health of currency and the US banking system.

Most of their instruments (Fed rate, reserve ratios, bond buybacks, etc) are aimed at either increasing or decreasing the amount of money “in supply”, or actively floating around the economy.

When they drop rates, more money enters supply because it’s cheaper. More people and entities borrow and spend."
2021-05-24 17:41:38,stocks,"You have it 100% backwards.  In a deflationary environment, you don't buy now, you wait for later, when it will be cheaper.  In an inflationary environment, you buy *now*, not a few weeks from now when it will be more expensive."
2021-05-24 16:28:12,stocks,"When demand is low there can be deflation due to less circulating money. This doesn't ""make everything more expensive"", but the strength of the dollar rises in value... whereas inflation is when the dollar falls in value."
2021-05-24 17:39:07,stocks,"It is hard to borrow.  At least for consumers.  The banks aren't interested in writing loans they don't profit from.  That's why the banks are so flush with cash.  The Fed stimulated massively, parked tons of liquidity at banks, and they turned around and sent markets flying up.  Now the banks don't know what to do, so they are parking a shit ton of cash back with the Fed with reverse repos.  But, they're not lending enthusiastically, as the Fed would like, because there's no profit in that right now."
2021-05-24 14:55:13,stocks,"Wouldn’t “more people borrowing to spend” be the point of dropping interest rates when small businesses can’t pull loans(I’ve heard of a seller having a hard time with a buyer due to inability to pull loan), and the government is trying to reopen businesses? Everyone is talking about a treasury bill shortage, and if people were forced to cover that shortage, wouldn’t that cause negative interest rates? I’m not talking about a long term, sustained period of negative interest rates, I am talking about a 6-8 month period of negative interest rates."
2021-05-24 16:40:48,stocks,"That’s kind of my point... inflation through deflation. What happens if you start deflation when there is a large monetary supply? If it drops enough, demand for products and services pick up, and inflation happens by demand not by governments backstopping prices."

No, they couldn't. This is why surgical robotic tools are manufactured in Mexico, clothes in Indonesia, drugs in India, and electronics in China. It's not because the mexicans or chinese or indians are better or equally good at manufacturing as the USA. 

The minimum wage in China is $350 or so before taxes. American factory workers make more than that in one week.

2021-05-24 14:17:08,stocks,Asking questions is the key to wisdom! If you have a lot of overlapping investments then reconfigure. That defeats the purpose of diversification.
2021-05-24 15:11:41,stocks,"VTI and spy (even just VTI) is sufficient to diversify you across US stocks. The other ETF’s are solely if you want to be overweight the positions in those ETF’s. In other words, adding additional ETF’s on top of VTI, makes you less diversified.

You may also consider investing in an all world, ex US fund, and an EM market fund, so you don’t have everything riding on the US."
2021-05-24 17:14:38,stocks,"You don't need to consolidate anything. ETF overlap doesn't matter. Suppose ETF1 has 5% Apple and ETF2 has 5% Apple. Whether you have 100% of your portfolio in ETF1 or 50/50 split into ETF1 & ETF2, you still have 5% Apple."
2021-05-24 14:23:38,stocks,"I am not a financial advisor and therefore all information is for informations purposes only… if each ETF is a representation of the market index - say S&P 500 - then why invest in multiple different copies of the same index tracker. That said they dont exactly have 100% the same holdings given like cash holdings, then the only diversification is in the cash holdings. Pick one and call it a day. Then id pick a desired portfolio structure for whatever your end goal is. Imagine a 90/10 split. Knowing average returns for SP500 is X and you invest 90% then the remaining 10% could be… i think there are a few stocks that could smash through 10% and would like to capture that. Great! So 90% market 10% speculative. Now you added some risk both upside and downside. Since your average for the market is X and you’re at 90% weight then the 10% speculative will add X+-  x% to your overall returns. 

So whats the point. Stick to a manageable risk profile 80/20 or 90/10 and have at it. Thats a simple strategy. 

You could add another strategy to the portfolio but the majority should stay in the market index. For example you could do 70/20/10. 70 index, 20 dividends, 10 speculative. There might be some overlap, but your reason is sound. Eg i want some quarterly income in cash so i can reinvest elsewhere. Im not saying this is good or bad, but want to show that you can do this, but make sure to manage risk the right way."

2021-05-24 14:21:17,stocks,"Thanks for the reply!

Any recommendations as to how to reconfigure?

My gut feeling right now is to stick with VTI and NOBL and perhaps keep QQQ for that bigger growth expectancy. However my (very limited experience) sees SPY growing a bit faster than VTI even though the latter has had a slight edge in growth over the last 5 years."

2021-05-24 17:52:06,stocks,"Try this [ETF comparison tool](https://www.etfrc.com/funds/overlap.php). You can see how much they overlap. The weighted figure is the number to pay attention to. 

Essentially with VTI, SPY, and QQQ you have a wide diversification in US stocks that get heavier and heavier into large growth, particularly tech. So there's nothing wrong with having all three at all. Just put how much you're comfortable with in each. If you love big tech, keep pumping QQQ. SPY is basically just the S&P500, and VTI is the safest bet if you just want wide exposure to everything

Edit: after a second look it seems VTI and SPY are weighted at 82% overlap. You may want to look at VT for some international exposure and picking either VTI or SPY. Some food for thought"

Then you'll miss out on the gains if it goes up even higher above the 50MA before the next Sunday.

The rest of the strategy is just going to get you deeper and deeper in the hole on a losing asset. As it goes down, you will be taking on exponentially more risk. What if it doesn't go back up?

Also, you don't have a plan for when to sell."
2021-05-24 13:48:16,stocks,Yes it is a dumb idea.  No it is not DCA.  DCA is buying on a set schedule without caring what the price is.  In your scenario you will never add to a winning position and you will add uneven amounts to losing positions.  You are just trying to time the market with a fancy formula wrapped around it.
2021-05-24 17:21:35,stocks,What if it doesn't go under the 50MA? Sometimes stocks can go up for a long time. I think the purpose of DCA is to mindlessly put the $100 in every Sunday so you take the human element out of the equation.

2021-05-24 14:26:05,stocks,"There’s no way we see 25% inflation, it’s impossible.  The Federal Reserve has two mandates: full employment and inflation of 2-2.5%.

As far as p/e, you realize that the company owns real estate that it opens locations on right? Depreciation on the real estate brings down earnings but it’s a non cash flow item. 

When people seek deep value, they have to understand the nuance of the business and examine their DCF models to see if there’s growth moving forward. The past performance is irrelevant, it’s what is in the horizon that is important.

PS: Also, don’t knock people that go to strip clubs or folks that work at drive thrus.

2021-05-24 11:44:25,stocks,"all i know is that stay at home moms get their kitchen renovation ideas from PINS

and you know moms are the decision makers in a household"
2021-05-24 11:01:39,stocks,"Online shopping will never really ""calm down"".

PINS is good platform because their users don't mind ads and are generally there to get inspired and buy stuff. 

If they can find a good method to monetize their users (which has insane growth) then should be very solid long term."
2021-05-24 14:32:56,stocks,"This is the perfect time to load up on Pinterest IMO. You might not see these prices again if the broader macro economic status stays put. I have listened to their last few ER calls  and read their  ER reports and I'm very bullish. Here are my takeaways:

Business is conservative with their Guidance as always, hence the selloff after the last ER call.  BUT they are guiding **105% growth** next quarter

*"".. ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and other factors. Our current expectation is that Q2 revenue will grow around 105% year over year. ""*

*""...In Q2, we expect global MAUs to grow in the mid-teens and US MAUs to be around flat on a year-over-year percentage basis.""*

Total revenue was **up 78% y/y to $485M**, steady growth. MAU was 478M, less than 480M expected but it was **up 30% y/y** . This was another reason of selloff, which I think is way more exaggerated.

Pinterest is intentionally slowing the ads shown in order to grow the users. There is a price to pay if you monetize the users too early before the network effect is fully realized. This is the sole reason why Pinterest has low ARPU compared to Snapchat. FB's ARPU is on it's own league so let's not talk about that here. 

 Pinterest has almost double the active users but the market cap is less than half. It's growing faster than Snapchat. They can double from here just by monetizing their current users.

They have not realized their e-commerce potential yet, it has not even started, I think they have just dipped their toe to see how it goes. It will be huge even if their user growth stalls  or even shrinks from current level. They have partnered with Shopify and it has been successful so far. Also as of today they have partnered with IKEA.

Users go to the Pinterest with the intention of shopping and they don't mind the ads. It's the only platform where the ads actually complements what you are looking for. From my own experience I like how I get different full bedroom setups ads with an option to buy.

CEO and founder Ben Silbermann owns around 6% (I think, don't quote me on this) of the shares. I like how founder has heavy skin on the game.  Also I like how the management is executing on the roadmap year after year.

Here is what I'll like to see going forward:  I want to see them go full force on the better social media strategy with inspirations and e-commerce. I like them to partner with more companies like Shopify, IKEA, etc. and also keep on working on the native e-commerce experience. Focus on the growth of e-commerce aspect while slowing down the ads aspect though it's incredibly tough at this moment.

&#x200B;

*Disclosure: I own few hundred shares of PINS and it is one of my top positions. Not a financial advice.*"
2021-05-24 11:22:54,stocks,"I bought in at the IPO and added when it dipped into the teens last March. I think the last ER that caused the price to plunge was a bit overblown, but management didn't do themselves any favors when they basically said on the call that they weren't sure why user growth was slowing. I think the platform itself is great for advertising and I plan to keep holding my shares"
2021-05-24 11:52:07,stocks,"One of my highest conviction holdings.  Incredible growth and just starting to scratch the surface of the e-commerce side of the business.  Still a bit overpriced due to share dilution, but huge potential.  People have to realize that PINS is unique because it isn't social media."
2021-05-24 12:28:04,stocks,"I really like the stock. They have a product that will be a part of the future as they are an ecommerce business, but also a social media. They have a solid userbase and when people are in Pinterest, they are ready to spend *money*. That is huge for the platform.

Their financials are good. They are constantly growing in high digits YoY and they’ll continue to do so as they monetize the platform more. They did report that their MAU (monthly average user) growth would slow a little bit as pandemic eases. This has been one of the drivers for the plummet of its stock recently. But I felt like it was an overreaction. Balance sheet is also healthy.

Last, but certainly not the least, their management is in my opinion excellent. I like their vision that they are aiming for long term growth and they are doing it by thinking what is best for the product. I really like the CEO and founder Ben Silbermann and I think he’s the right person for the lead."

2021-05-24 11:18:28,stocks,"Lol zero idea about the business model... but the management is clueless. It’s a solid stock, monetization of users is increasing and also adding new users (33% increase if memory serves). It’s a flywheel that should lead to some substantial share price gains. FB is making close to $30 a user while PINS is under $2 for comparison. Not saying they need to have FB level monetizing but that’s a big discrepancy."

2021-05-24 13:06:14,stocks,"This is what's so interesting about PINS. Iffffff they could get their e-commerce going, wouldn't PINS be able to make more revenue per user than FB? PINS just seems like the perfect platform for monetization. Advertisements are part of the experience, people go there looking for ideas which could/should lead to the sale of items. The potential certainly is there, which is why I plunked down for 650 shares around $20 per. I figured this could be the next tenbagger and didn't wanna let this one get away (I've watched too many opportunities pass me by)."
2021-05-24 15:56:20,stocks,"Where do you get Pinterest ""has almost double the active users than SNAP""? As far as I am aware, SNAP reports on DAU while PINS reports on MAU. DAU is a much better indicator for user and revenue growth."

2021-05-24 17:29:25,stocks,"The fact Pins doesn't report DAU makes me very skeptical of their user growth. IG, FB, Twitter, and Snap all report on DAU. MAU is a metric that is very easy to game. If a user accidentally visits Pinterest (via SEO, marketing Email, or app notifs), they will be counted as a MAU."
2021-05-24 18:34:22,stocks,"I work at Twitter and personally, I don't care whether these companies choose to report DAUs or MAUs. Ideally, they should report both. I'm sure people also criticize companies like Twitter for not reporting MAUs because their MAUs aren't as impressive."

How does anyone lose a ton of money with options? Why wouldn’t they just let the contracts expire and lose their premium, isn’t that the only real risk you have with options - because it gives you the right not the obligation? 

I browse WSB and see their “loss porn” and as someone who doesn’t know too much about options I just scratch my head because how is someone so negative on a position - it’s not like the premiums are hundreds of thousands of dollars, are they?!?

The risk is offset by cost. One option contract is significantly cheaper than owning 100 shares of the stock. That lower cost can be used to offset some risk - or it can be used to over leverage yourself.

Now compare that to just buying $24,000 worth of the same stock. In scenario 1 you lose $24,000 or 100% of your investment, in scenario 2 you might lose some money but definitely not your full investment.

It's worth noting that you can always sell to close before you lose everything, but I'm just trying to demonstrate how options magnify losses and gains when compared to just taking the same amount of money and buying the stock"

Some people SELL options with nothing to hedge their risk. When the trade goes sideways they're obligated to buy/sell the underlying at massive losses.

The fact that their prices fluctuate with the food input and manure output of the horse, is what we can capitalize on. 

Perhaps a better analogy is that game show Let’s make a deal, with the [Monty Hall problem.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem?wprov=sfti1) and lots of doors.

If you had any other short term gains, it would apply to them as well - but since you don't, it can then offset long term gains. This then cancels out the long term gain, leaving you with net 0 to pay taxes on. 

In this case the order doesn't make a difference (although in other situations, say if you did not have enough losses to offset all gains, it could matter)."

2021-05-24 19:49:33,stocks,"Right, but you'd only be able to deduct $3000 from your gains - if you're making tens or hundreds of thousands in gains the following year(s) you'd be paying fat taxes anyway.

AVIR - Atea Pharma

\- Is a biotech company which focuses on oral antiviral drugs, main focuses are covid (e.g. treating people who caught the virus, not the vaccine) which is in Phase 3 of testing (should hear results in the next few months, but already licensed to Roche) and Hep C (much earlier stages). What caught my eyes is that they became profitable this year, and they earnings are estimated to grow massively \~90% and generally seems to have reached all time low of around \~$22 vs an ATH of almost \~$90 

&#x200B;

CRSR - Corsair

\- Gaming and streaming equiment, another company that seems grossly undervalued. They have had a massive 2020 thanks to Covid which is expected to keep growing as the gaming industry in general. After a strong rally post IPO, where it reached an ATH of \~$50 is currently sitting at $30 and generally sees to have a pretyt low P/E ratio.

&#x200B;

Thoughts?"

2021-05-24 12:38:15,stocks,It’s the weekly Corsair thread
2021-05-24 08:25:51,stocks,"I’m holding 250 shares of CRSR. Top tear gaming gear, streaming gear and pc internals. Also prebuilt PCs. One of the best in the industry and should easily be $40. I think the average analyst price is $42."
2021-05-24 08:32:54,stocks,"I bought into AVIR last week, the momentum has slowed down and further growth appears to rely on results of their drug trials. But overall it's a -20% risk for a potential 100%+ gain."
2021-05-24 15:56:04,stocks,"I'm normally a lurker here, but I do love CRSR. I am loading up to 1000 shares, currently at 300. Maybe going to shoot for 2000. The fundamentals are solid, company moat is growing, and I like the growth opportunity in the gaming sector. As a former video game player, I know how addicting it is. Also, with the current niche work environment, where people are constantly trying to find a hustle for cash, I can see gaming and streaming becoming a sector for that, since more and more people are watching entertaining youtubers and twitchers, etc..."
2021-05-24 09:00:25,stocks,Totally unrelated but I went heavy into CRS (Carpenter Technology) in 2020. Holy crap it’s been a blessing
2021-05-24 14:36:47,stocks,CRSR a steal
2021-05-24 07:42:28,stocks,More than half of the CRSR volume is daytraders. The pattern is clearly set where you buy anywhere above 30$ normally around 35-36$ and sell above 40. It goes up to 40 very frequently but usually stays there for just a few hours or in best case a few days.
2021-05-24 16:50:41,stocks,"Look at the 6 month chart of CRSR. It's dead money.

Lamest stock I ever had the pleasure to hold. Moved to LOGI and been more than happy.

I'm not saying Corsair is not a good company to invest in, but the stock is the absolute shit, and I don't think that will change."
2021-05-24 12:06:41,stocks,"Bought some CRSR after Jeremy from Financial Education released his bull thesis videos, Strong bull thesis, just not exciting enough to make a major position out of, if it really dumps ill definately buy more, but its not something i have to make a major position out of at all costs. He's also super hot on DBX and I don't feel the same excitement. Planet 13, tattoeed chef, and Facebook however count me in,"
2021-05-24 14:54:57,stocks,"As someone who managed to buy corsair during the dip under IPO price on the first trading day; I'm buying more at this price for sure. It ran further than it should have a few months ago, but at the current p/e I think it's a steal. 

Let's hope they keep up the growth."
2021-05-24 10:49:18,stocks,"$HEAR blows $CRSR out of the water, unreal financials and huge market share (7 of top 10 selling headphones). Will likely get acquired for $40+ before the end of the year."

2021-05-24 08:51:25,stocks,I keep adding as it keeps dropping. Very much a ‘I’ll fuckn do it agen’ meme for me

2021-05-24 16:13:25,stocks,"This, but make sure you pick up some TLRY too


plz"
2021-05-24 07:33:07,stocks,"Intersting, did you buy straight after the IPO?"
2021-05-24 13:14:03,stocks,"I think a lot of people are overlooking the fact that there are very many computer equipment manufacturers, and just from personal experience, Corsair is NOT the best equipment manufacturer. They have notoriously cheap build quality, poor support, and occupy a niche of entry level gear. I don’t know how much room they really have to grow unless something in the PC accessories and hardware industry changes significantly in the next 5 years (and it has changed a lot in the last 5)"
2021-05-24 07:29:15,stocks,"Yeah, my main concerns are around the high level of debt (which is due to acquisitions to be fair) and the fact that it is unlikely they will record the same growth as last year if things pick back up again 🤔"
2021-05-24 07:59:24,stocks,I would tend to agree but I realised that my portfolio is a bit over-exposed on defensive stocks through BLK and BRK (duuuuh) so looking to spice up the chicken
2021-05-24 11:48:23,stocks,"CRSR hasn't touched 40 since february and has traded sideways since march in the 31-35 range, seems like an awful stock for day traders"
2021-05-24 07:44:02,stocks,Where do you extrapolate that information from?
2021-05-24 18:33:45,stocks,You're getting downvoted by bagholders
2021-05-24 10:56:13,stocks,"False, hear was begging corsair to be bought,
As for corsair they are top 3 in every gaming sector.
Look up their investor site."
2021-05-24 11:01:42,stocks,What is unreal about their financials?
2021-05-24 10:54:24,stocks,Oh that's an interesting one I haven't seen before. Gotta deep dive into it
2021-05-24 11:37:07,stocks,"Hahah me too. I was in at 42, which I believed was a fine price... then it dropped so now I'm avg at 34. Thinking I'll add a bit more today"
2021-05-24 07:39:04,stocks,"After two months, when it started to drop after the bull run."
2021-05-24 16:09:25,stocks,"I don't agree about anything you said about Corsair products and support services, but I agree 100% that ""there are very many computer equipment manufacturers"" and this seems like another stock getting undeserved love from reddit.  Reddit has a major hard on for tons of no-moat companies... when there are companies like Razer, Logitech, Glorious, probably several others I'm missing... what's their competitive advantage?

No one seems to give good reasons *this* company in particular is a worthy stock to buy, it tends to be ""but gaming is going to increase bro"". Almost all the posts about CRSR on this subreddit are actually DDs on why to buy a gaming or computer hardware ETF, not CRSR stock. 

for full disclosure  I'm bagholding CRSR."
2021-05-24 08:01:05,stocks,"If you want to look at a company performance where the stock has lagged take a look at
NLS"
2021-05-24 12:09:33,stocks,"Every tech stock has been down since February, though

Edit: or completely sideways"
2021-05-24 07:48:39,stocks,Look at the day to day chart at any given day in January or February. You will see the stock go up to 41-45$ shortly after the market opens and then back down to 38-36$ a few hours later. Im not sure how you can see the volume on passed days but if you looked at it back then you would see what im talking about.
2021-05-24 07:42:36,stocks,"I see, during that sideway-ish trend..I see it has tested $30 around 3 times now so that makes me a bit more comfortable with a buy right now, but I think a $45/$50 again is doable in the next few months."
2021-05-24 08:03:17,stocks,Yeah I saw that while screening...but a bit too small cap for me 😬😬
2021-05-24 12:21:03,stocks,"Yeah that’s true, I just wasn’t sure what the guy I replied to meant when he said “it goes up to 40 very frequently”"
2021-05-24 08:00:03,stocks,I see! I'll have a better look at intraday charts :)
2021-05-24 08:53:27,stocks,"Crsr I don't think 45 to 50 in the next few months is doable. It turns around pretty hard over 35. And since the pullback its struggled anytime it gets near 33.  I also think it can go lower still if tech gets slapped in the next pullback again. 

It's a good company just temper the expectations and maybe dont go full position today because it can potentially come down further. Idk where the bottom is on this but you want to be in on it once it finds it.  It's a good company with a ton of growth potential still. The only downside is that it's a heavy retail market so it's pretty volatile. Use that volatility to your advantage or it will turn on you."
2021-05-24 08:05:27,stocks,Should be worth about 750-800 million and now it's worth 500 but good luck
2021-05-24 08:55:57,stocks,"Oh very fine point, any of these buys on my side would be limit orders, right now I'm thinking $30.5  on  CRSR and  $21.5 on AVIR :)"
2021-05-24 08:12:02,stocks,"The main concern there is an institutional inverstor coming out and taking a bit cut of the price, anyway I'm already exposed to it via BLK :) It's an interesting stock for sure!"
2021-05-24 09:15:00,stocks,If you got 100 dollars for example. I’d put 15 now and keep adding 15 when it dips that way your cost average is lower vs putting all 100 today.
2021-05-24 09:19:41,stocks,"Long term I have no idea if this holds up but in the short term 30.50 is a good place to get started. We've seen it hit 29 before, i think it even went to 28.50 maybe.  Just to give you an idea of how far back it can go in the short term. Those were on huge crash days also. 

The main thing is to remember to sell the rise cause this one will go up and down a lot, take some profit as you go and then reload when it dips. It's a good one to slowly build a position in while averaging down in case of a future pullback."
2021-05-24 09:26:28,stocks,"Yep the good old averaging.. I tend to prefer limit orders when I'm a bit less committed. Keeping some headroom, can also average them too :)"

I think the last major thing I might do is wait to break even one of my holds and consolidate that money into the other holds so I am not spread quite as thin (in hindsight the money would have been better off just dumped into GOOG and my ETFs) and can rebalance even more easily. 

Other than that, sit and watch is looking to be king. The more nutty things I do with my portfolio (namely rush to buy stocks without doing true due dilligence) the more regretful decisions I'll make. More tickers to watch means more chances to screw up as I've had to learn the hard way."

I do a bit of fractional shares in the latter part. I might make 5-10 transactions a week.

All that being said, I'm wondering if there's better options of brokerages for me? I don't consider it a priority at the moment, but I've heard enough shady things about the various brokers and I'm not sure if IBKR is screwing me in an unforeseen way that would make me jump ship immediately if I knew about it."

2021-05-24 11:56:49,stocks,"Pretty much everything I've done DD on for them has just been looking up articles and reading up on graphite. I know their biggest backer is The Pallinghurst Group, and their biggest hurdle to production in Canada was achieving a permit for mining which they got a few months back. The Canadian Government have also expressed support for them as well.

My understanding is that something like 90% of the world's graphite currently comes from China but with NMG being based in Canada they would be a far more reliable and affordable alternative to auto-makers in NA. Anodes are one of the four main components of lithium-ion batteries and are made with graphite, and NMG serves not just as a mine for graphite but also a production factory for the anodes specifically for use in lithium ion batteries. 

They have a youtube channel that they have put out a handful of advertisement videos on which are pretty funny and kind of show off the culture/humor that the team in charge has. While I've never contacted them myself my understanding is that the CEO and a few others engage with people on twitter and investor meetings.

They were an OTC stock for a long while until recently, and they just went through a reverse-split which scared a bunch of people away and tanked the price for a while. It was a 10-1 spilt when they were around $1.70/share, and after the split it dropped to as low as $10/share until recovering recently to get back up around $16 before today. I believe the highest I've ever seen it was around $2.05/$2.10 before the split shortly after the permit announcement.

People also point out that technology is changing and the graphite part of lithium-ion batteries, or lithium-ion in their entirety, might change over the next ten years, but the CEO has ensured they have taken such things into account. I also believe there were some protests after they got their permit from a local tribe or something but my understanding is that the tribe doesn't actually live anywhere close to the mining site itself and NMG has been very open and accommodating to them, even offering them employment.

Full disclosure I am pretty new at the stock thing and NMG are the first company I ever really did DD on, and they seem like a pretty good bet and I just got lucky, even if I don't have a huge position in them or anything, at least relative to the kind of numbers I've seen thrown around elsewhere. 

TL;DR, they are basically the number one player in a growing market and offer far more accessibility to that market than the main players in it now. They also market themselves really well and seem to have good people up and down throughout their company. The drawbacks would be jumping in on a stock that is so fresh to a major exchange and still two years or so away from reaching full production, and potential technological changes that might effect their future. 

I'd suggest you check out some of their marketing videos on youtube, even if you decide not to invest you may at least get a laugh out of it!"

2021-05-24 16:32:15,stocks,F at the end means foreign. Nothing was hidden from you
2021-05-24 16:47:26,stocks,"I never claimed it was, nothing was made obvious. I'm an archaeologist that tried to buy stock and Fidelity is supposed to be a means for regular folks to do that. But fuck me for not being an expert and knowing a letter on a ticker had some underling meaning. Traders looking down on and nay saying outsiders and newbs is x-box call-of-duty level ridiculous. How about fidelity updates their interface and makes shit like that way less easy to miss, especially if they are claiming to serve non-professionals? Far too many complaints about that very issue for it not to be their fault."
2021-05-24 17:15:21,stocks,"Who's looking down on and nay saying you? I'm simply saying that it's not Fidelity's fault that you didn't research a company enough to know that the NYSE ticker was a foreign exchange ticker. Investing isn't meant to be a blind shot with a dart at a list of radom letters. It involves research beyond just a post on Reddit or from WSB (making an assumption based on your avatar having diamond hands). 

Do your research - read the fine print. 

ETFs are designed for those that don't want to extra burden of doing research on companies, they do that for you and you ""pay"" them for it as part of their expense ratio.

You can't blame anyone for not knowing that the F at the end of that security means it's foreign. I can guarantee Fidelity sent you information when you opened your account that includes links to how-to's and videos to help people learn things about investing. They can only do so much and they aren't going to make every person click through a series of screens, warnings, and informational pages in order to make a single trade. That's your responsibility to do that prior to hitting the buy button."
2021-05-24 17:46:25,stocks,"Again, margin was not enabled. I had 12 dollars available total, they would have blocked a 13 dollar trade but not one where they get to charge 100 dollars in fees with a tiny off-center warning tucked in a corner of the screen. I'm not blameless here, but I do feel a bit victimized and think fidelity deserves a bit of scrutiny. Again, my complaint is apparently a very common one, and at some point it needs to be acknowledged that fidelity bears some responsibility."
2021-05-24 18:06:01,stocks,"They bear zero responsibility.

I'll agree that it's not great that the fee is applied a day or two after the trade - but that also allows people time to make a deposit into their account without losing the opportunity to buy at a certain price due to the fee. 

It has nothing to do with margin since it's a fee tacked on after the fact, not during the trade. My understanding for this is that there are scenarios where the fee isn't applied based on where the sell order came from that fills your buy order."
2021-05-24 18:53:12,stocks,"I mean, if they are gonna implement after-the-fact fees for ""convenience"" wouldn't it also make sense to not allow trades for significantly less than the after the fact fees? Again, it's not like I'm remotely the first person to fall into this trap. Basically the consensus seems to be ""haha, newb mistake"", it's that common. At that point the implications of the transaction is unclear by design and I can't be convinced otherwise. Technically the buyer IS at fault for not studying the poor warning pop-up, but the fact that those are easily ignored are not lost by Fidelity by any means. They very much want that mistake to be a common one."
2021-05-24 19:14:58,stocks,I'll agree with you that it would be nice for them to give a warning if you are making a buy order that equals or is less than the fees that would go along with the purchase.
2021-05-24 19:39:49,stocks,"Yay, we agreed on something and no one was called a nasty name this entire exchange. You're a good redditor, cheers to you!"
2021-05-24 19:41:22,stocks,Cheers to you as well! Good luck with future endeavors.

### Media Release

**Munich, May 20, 2021:** Lilium GmbH (“Lilium”), positioned to be a global leader in regional electric air mobility with the development of its electric vertical take-off and landing jet (“Lilium Jet”), and Luxembourg-based Luxaviation Group, one of the largest business aircraft and helicopter operators worldwide, today announced that Luxaviation Group plans to support Lilium in building out airline operations in Europe.

Lilium’s vision for a flexible transportation ecosystem is supported by world-class partners. Luxaviation Group brings over 60 years of experience operating passenger service with hundreds of aircraft under management and 10 Air Operator Certificates (“AOCs”) across Europe.

Building on Luxaviation Group's track record, which includes securing the first European Union Aviation Safety Agency AOC approval for a business jet operator, the parties anticipate Luxaviation Group will become responsible for parts of the airline operations being developed by Lilium. This includes securing necessary approvals and managing pilots, which will be trained following a type rating concept developed by Lufthansa Aviation Training, another Lilium partner. As Lilium continues developing its launch networks in Europe for the planned commercial launch in 2024, Luxaviation Group will also work with Lilium on the development of its best-in-class customer experience, built around Lilium’s digital airline platform and the 7-Seater Lilium Jet.

“We are proud to be working alongside Luxaviation Group, a leading operator in the aviation sector with a track record in offering an innovative and customer-focused service, to build out the Lilium network in Europe. This marks a key milestone as we prepare for launch, and we look forward to working together to provide an exceptional airline service for our passengers,” explains Remo Gerber, Chief Operating Officer at Lilium.

Patrick Hansen, Group CEO at Luxaviation Group said: “Electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft will fundamentally change the way we travel, and the Lilium network is poised to be at the forefront of this sea change in aviation”. Christophe Lapierre, Head of Strategy of Luxaviation Group adds: “We are very pleased to have been selected by Lilium to be their partner in aircraft operations. As an early believer in advanced air mobility, we look forward to bringing our experience and credentials to the partnership with Lilium and building out a service that will truly feel like a first of its kind.”

Lilium has previously announced plans for launch networks in Germany through partnerships with Munich, Nuremberg, Dusseldorf, and Cologne/Bonn airports.

**About Lilium**

Lilium’s vision is to create a sustainable and accessible mode of high-speed, regional transportation. Using the 7-Seater Lilium Jet, an electric vertical take-off and landing jet, offering leading capacity, low noise and high performance, Lilium is building a transport network and service for people and goods. Working in partnership with world-leading aerospace, technology and infrastructure partners, commercial operations are planned to launch in 2024. Lilium’s 600+-strong team includes over 400 aerospace engineers and a leadership responsible for delivering some of the most successful aircraft in aviation history.

2021-05-24 12:56:02,stocks,"I am not so sure about Lilium, there are many unanswered questions regarding the prototype on actual range performance or if they even could lift the weight they claim, because there are no demos with weight, no demos with journalists and claims by German professors, that they physically cannot do what they claim to be able to do. I would stay away for now. Volocopter and Ehang looking way more promising.

But still good news for them."
2021-05-24 08:45:59,stocks,That's good news. Lillium also isn't quite as expensive as some of their competition
2021-05-24 13:22:34,stocks,The plane they claim to have isn’t scientifically possible...... but good luck!
2021-05-24 00:00:00,stocks,"Why is day trading restricted? I’m new to stocks, why is day trading only really allowed with portfolios with 25k+, what is the logic behind this? It seems like something that so blatantly caters to the rich would cause more of an uproar, what am I missing?"
2021-05-24 01:35:50,stocks,Sounds like your missing about 25k
2021-05-24 12:27:56,stocks,"You can day trade all you want on settled funds, but it takes time for funds to settle. A good faith violation is selling  stock that hasn't settled without reserve funds to match it. If you have twice the buying power of the trade you are making you can swing it in a day. If you want to trade 5000$ 500 times a day.... well your money isn't  instantaneously back in the account after going from broker to clearing house to you in 5 seconds, you just see your purchase or proceeds on your screen.  It's not a rich thing it's a margin thing. I've gotten gfv on accounts 10× 25k cause I was excited and didn't check my buying power. If you have margin you are just borrowing buying power. But you need x collateral to qualify."
2021-05-24 05:10:20,stocks,You are being protected against yourself. You don't want to blow up your only money by day trading
2021-05-24 02:18:11,stocks,One word ... Risk!
2021-05-24 01:38:20,stocks,"Might be an unpopular opinion, but if you’re sitting on less than 25K capital you probably shouldn’t be day trading even if you were allowed to do so. You’ll do better buying and holding for most of your portfolio unless you really know what you’re doing (I don’t mean you did your homework and watched some videos or whatever, I mean you have a lot of experience)

That said I think everyone should have a small amount to play with to help them learn, keep themselves interested while reading up on companies and markets etc. as long as you’re okay with losing whatever that play money amount is.

Legit answer though is to uphold the integrity of the market. More people day trading means more daily volume, and more volatility, plain and simple. Just look at the crazy volumes of meme stocks and how wild the valuations get. Super cool to watch and take part in. Not so great if that happened across the board to every stock. In fact I wouldn’t be surprised if we see even more regulation that restricted retail trading on margin accounts."
2021-05-24 01:18:14,stocks,"Day trading requires a margin account so trades can settle given the time it takes to settle a trade. If you can ‘day trade’ and since there is a delay in settlement then you are essentially borrowing from the bank to float the trades while they settle. Given that this comes with inherent risk, it is required to have a margin account and have X amount of money. This isn’t about the rich at all. Dont confuse the motive. These kinds of laws have been in place since some of the worst times in financial history. Yes i know this one particular ruling/law might be newer, but the concept is the same. It is to protect people from inherent risk that they cant afford."
2021-05-24 03:51:11,stocks,Whats up with america lagging technology for banks to settle instantly? If I deposit money into my brokerage account its there instantly. If I do a trade its settled instantly.
2021-05-24 08:59:37,stocks,"First of all, if you're 'new to stocks', you should strongly consider spending time learning about investing before jumping into day trading.

The restriction only applies to margin accounts. You can day trade with settled funds in a cash account to your hearts desire with any amount of money you may have.

The reasoning for the rule is to protect people from over leveraging themselves and blowing up their account. If you trade on margin, not only can you lose all your money but you can lose even more on top of it. The rule came out during the dot com bubble around 1999-2000. People lost their shirts day trading because they didn't understand what they were getting themselves in to."
2021-05-24 01:48:33,stocks,Policy makers think you're too stupid to be an active trader. The rationale is that they're protecting the poors from themselves. :)
2021-05-24 01:33:42,stocks,Blockchain could effectively get rid of settlement periods. The restriction is an inefficiency in the market.  Margin is a consequence of the inefficiency.
2021-05-24 07:55:06,stocks,"Because they want to limit how many of us can play at once, because if they let us all play they dont have as much of an advantage and they have to react and predict market changes more rapidly.  All of those are less profitable for banks. Banks donate to politicians, politicans make laws. 

So they control how many of us are allowed to bag hold for the financial institutions at one time, or else they might have to baghold for us. 

You would think it would cause an uproar but half the people actually believe it's for our own protection and the other half are too poor to even care about the stock market because you cant play this game when you're living paycheck to paycheck."
2021-05-24 11:58:07,stocks,Allegedly because the government feels that it is in its purview to protect people from themselves.
2021-05-24 10:39:41,stocks,"I’m not even going to mention politics, but with the amount of info out there on how to trade I don’t think it’s anyone’s right, especially not the fucking useless ass SEC, to restrict anyone’s ability to trade. You decide to be stupid and lose 50k? Damn that sucks bro. No diff than eating yourself to death, all personal risk. *unpopular opinion*"

2021-05-24 04:35:47,stocks,Retail is limited to 3 day trades a week to help integrity of the market. Hedge funds lose a billion in a week shorting two stocks lol. There is no integrity it’s just who they want to have more upside.
2021-05-24 01:49:31,stocks,"I live in Canada and I can trade what ever I want as many times as I want, even with $1. You're long winded explanation sounds like BS to me. Land of the not so free eh?"
2021-05-24 04:44:03,stocks,"Uphold the integrity?  Are you implying that hedge fund managers don't blatantly manipulate the market by short selling penny stocks?  Or by inflating share prices only to dump them later?

2021-05-24 15:56:53,stocks,"I’m not implying anything, that’s the purported reason behind the restriction. Believe what you want, but it’s not like it’s exactly a new thing. However the recent influx of retail traders into the marketplace is certainly very new. It’s like people started to play a game and found out some rules aren’t to their liking so they must be wrong. Maybe they are, maybe they’re not, maybe they should change. But you don’t have to day trade to make money anyway.

What I do think should change is the rules used to flag pattern day trading. Like same day buying/selling of a dozen or so different shares once in that same week does not make you a day trader IMO - it’s about frequency not volume. If you do that multiple days that week then sure. But maybe you are fine tuning your trades that day and plan on leaving it be for months afterward. Markets change and fluctuate so while you’re entering into a new position it would be nice to be able to have that flexibility.

Rule should be no more than one day a week, or maybe a month, for high volume day trading activity - OR no more than 4 days with a day trade. But then I guess I could see people easily abusing this system so idk."

2021-05-24 12:50:01,stocks,"The larger number of users on NYSE or NASDQ - international users , domestic users, eg hedge funds, investment banks, etc. can provide a smoother variance to the market (in the long run)…but when spikes/larger than normal variances/black swan events do occur, the hurt to small investors is catastrophic. Its not to say that accredited investors and institutions can take those impacts and we don’t care about them, but in terms of order of magnitude small investors get hurt more. 

Furthermore, given the larger number of users and their impact on the market, in the short run they can cause higher variances while still smoothing out the variances in the long run. i.e. lots of noise when zooming into hours/minutes/seconds. Think flash crashes, etc. on the long run the big investors smooth out the economy by providing liquidity to the market. Unfortunately the small investor cant recover when theyre margin called and dont have funding to support. 

Now given what happened during the Great Depression and other key financial oopsies, with the group hurt the most being the small investor, laws were put in place to protect them. They supply a different form of liquidity and we dont/cant lose that. 

In the end the small investor is the supplier of cash and demand of loans. Institutions supply loans using supplier cash. If one side freezes so does the other. One can weather the storm longer than the other. 

Smaller exchanges/markets dont have that same level of total economic impact. Its not as much of a dent to the economy (world wide mind you) when canadian markets (only as an example) sees problems. If us markets freeze, well, we know what happens then."

Intro:

> The global semiconductor chip shortage crisis has struck Volkswagen USA. The automaker has just confirmed that production at its massive Chattanooga, Tennessee factory will shut down for two weeks starting on June 7.

Excerpt:

> But VW isn't about to let a crisis go to waste. Instead of letting dust collect on the plant's machinery and many workers being sent home, upgrades will take place on the assembly line focusing on quality improvements and other related areas.

> In addition, workers will continue training and preparation to build the ID.4 all-electric crossover. At present, the ID.4 is only built alongside its ID.3 hatchback sibling at VW's Zwickau plant in Germany. That means all ID.4s on the road in America right now are imported, but this won't last for long.

And:

> VW is adding a state-of-the-art high-voltage laboratory designed specifically to develop and test EV cells and battery packs."

Whatever profits you are making are simply according to the size of the product you trade.

/ES = 500 shares of SPY


/MES = 50 shares of SPY


There's no ""advantage"" (besides taxes on 1265 products).  That's it. Now, of course, the margin requirements are different as the futures use SPAN margin. So you put up less money to hold the position, but that doesn't really effect how much profit you make just your ROC."

Seeing that 5k becomes about 2.5 million in 30 years (at about 20 cagr) I reasoned that since I will get many shots at making that 2.5 million I never needed to sell because of fear. I can afford to be wrong about a company and even if my initial investments - which was typically 5k to start - went to zero that would be ok in the end as many other shots I’d taken at good returns will work out. Also - it has indeed proven to been good to not care much about when I have had positions drop a lot.

Basically all the information the military has on UFO's. What if they reveal information that basically confirms that these things are real, and are being controlled by some other thing that we have zero power over? Wouldn't the market completely tank on news like this? Basically everybody but Lockeed Martin, Raytheon and Northrup Grumman would plummet. Right?"

This next wave of UFO hype is right on schedule when it comes to the theory pushed by (what seem like) paranoid conspiracy theory nuts that the path to a NWO will be multi-pronged, and that the final step will be a faked alien attack (fake alien ships, real death toll) and that we will have to band together to defeat them and somehow in that process the only way to do so will be to act as a united front as a one world government to stay strong and vigilant against ""future attacks"". I always thought it was crazy talk, but now FRESH off of covid not even fully being the rear-view mirror, we are getting a big dump of UFO stuff again, a super-sized version of some releases we had a year or 2 back (kind of priming us for this). Whether it's some super extreme conspiracy coming to life or just real aliens getting more brazen, if UFOs are real in any serious/dangerous manner, it's possible the stock market may cease to exist, as may we as well. On any rational side of things, a bunch of these videos are super old and if they truly exist, have this un-worldly tech and posed a threat, they would have done something by now.

That one clip where the navy pilot is narrating over a object that is traveling extremely fast and rotating on its axis with no exhaust trail is just ridiculous. Couple that with the fact that space is incomprehensibly big and time is incomprehensibly long, the odds being so heavily stacked in favor of millions of civilizations out there just spread out between time and space. I’d say at least one or two lasted long enough to figure out space travel. I mean a lil over 100 years ago humans had their first commercial flight in a plane. 100 years ago.

Knowing there is something out there that is different. But for me the part that is even more curious is that they (assuming you think it is something not from this planet) allow themselves to be seen. They aren’t and haven’t been harmful even though they could have, just opens a million other possibilities. The joe rogan podcast with a dude named bob lazar really makes you think.

2021-05-24 01:29:50,stocks,"As someone who specifically shorted them because of this, they were insanely overvalued. They sat at around 80x P/E before earnings and even with good earnings were still around 58x which was well above the average of the industry. More broadly, if you look at the general growth YoY they didn't really deserve their runup in price over the course of last year. No significant profit increase, no huge acquisitions, etc. Essentially, this stock was due for a correction like many other stocks have experienced in the past few months.

In addition to this, the outlook going forward from these earnings wasn't particularly spectacular so that wasn't encouraging enough for investors to hold their covid period stocks.

All that being said though, I am certain that this stock like many others will see a rebound after the correction finishes its course and around midsummer reach back at its high.

I'm not a very experienced investor so don't take my word for it, but this is just what I determined when researching this as a potential short before earnings and followed through with that decision based upon this thesis."

2021-05-24 10:41:00,stocks,"I’m going to choose to interpret “trading psychology” as “patience” in this case. And my comment will address how I’ve become more patient with trading. 

In summary - get busy with life. So busy with kids and work and the duties of maintaining a household that you don’t check your portfolio daily, sometimes not even monthly. 

You’ll miss a lot of newsworthy events, and you’ll look back and know if you were paying closer attention you could have entered or exited a position at a really great time. But you’ll also observe that your balances grow. And you’ll continue to add money regularly because that’s the discipline you’ve developed over decades of life. 

Occasionally you’ll have some downtime from life and you’ll jump in to optimize your portfolio, sticking to a strategy rather than a ticker. You’ll sell a good company whose stock has done well for you in order to buy a better company whose stock will also do well. You’ll wish you could afford both, but you’ll understand that no one can own everything they want, even the richest of the rich, so you accept that “choosing is refusing” and you don’t let it bother you that all choices have inherent opportunity costs. 

The first half-million is the hardest to get. From there the snowball picks up steam and you can see weekly swings (when you’re watching) that exceed your annual salary when you were broke and in college. Then one day you’ll pay annual taxes that exceed your salary when you were broke and in college. Then you’ll understand how these numbers are all relative to your stage of life and how “being rich” isn’t what you thought. It seems like “rich” is always more than what I’ve accumulated. 

But I’m “rich” compared to my 20-year-old self for sure. 

“It’s not what you make, it’s what you keep.”

However - if you make and keep a lot and simply hold onto it, your account balance grows but you’ll look around and see that you’re solidly middle class.  

You might be surprised and how many people have accumulated “wealth” but aren’t “wealthy”

Find things you love doing and do them. Money is a good servant but a cruel master."
2021-05-23 21:41:39,stocks,"I have a weekly deposit turn on for a $75 deposit into my Roth IRA. It’s all I can afford currently with my budget currently but it’s a start. This lets me not be really concerned about the overall market as if it’s down and red as hell I can buy at a discount and if it’s over all green then I can simply buy one of my holdings that is red (I have about 50 so unless all 50 are green I have something I can buy that week). 

This lets me have a positive attitude about investing as I’m gonna have a personal victory one way or another, either my overall portfolio went up or I added some great companies at a discounted price."
2021-05-23 23:02:29,stocks,"I keep a watchlist of maybe 20-30 at a time. Most I never buy. Short positions if I’m up a decent amount and don’t like it long term the gains go into blue chip/ dividend stocks.

2021-05-24 03:39:54,stocks,"I think the biggest improvement for me was learning how to check my portfolio every day. I think the self control to hold in big swings and getting used to those ebbs and flows is a big deal. Also by checking every day I can read up on when to add more or if there is a lawsuit/financial manipulation when to get out. Overall it’s been the biggest improvement to my investing.

The more swings you see the more numb you get. The more detached you are the better your decisions can be. Also only invest in what you would use or buy if you are allocating your investments. Still the best investing advice I was ever given. Also keep 20-40 stocks. More than that and it gets overwhelming, less and your portfolio won’t be well diversified."
2021-05-24 05:29:16,stocks,"I have those that I invest and those that I trade.

Those that are trade I don't view as stock/company, but as value. Meaning stop loss and take profit when I open the trade. Take profit is 1.5x what I have as stop loss, but if I notice a heavy sentiment on social media/news for the stock then I remove it and instead change the stop loss to the positive.

Example:
Stock bought at 10$, stop loss at 9$ and take profit at 11.5$. Stock reaches 11$ and I see a heavy positive sentiment, I remove the stop loss and watch it closely. When it reaches 11.5$ I now put a stop loss at 11$. Take profit usually happens manually here since it's a special case.

For investing I don't care what happens price wise, I didn't realize that for a while but the mindset is similar to Cathies investing strategy. She doesn't care at what price to buy in, she just wants to be in. And as long as no fundamentals that I determine as my own fundamentals changed I keep adding to the position unless I find something new and better. But I keep the position regardless.

The only time I sell an investment is when something majorly changes, like company structure or plan or environment for the company. Of course only if it's negative enough to actually sell anything. These are meant to be invested for the coming 40 years, so I am fine. Well, 30% are ETF, 50% are top S&P 500 companies and ""only"" 20% are the ones I would sell based on that."

Then I don't focus on it anymore except for a periodic review of if the exit is still valid. Helps keep emotion out of big swings either way. 

If I am trading on a thesis that is riskier (long options usually are in this category) then I'll usually set a stop or trailing stop that would allow me to exit with a profit if things turn south.

If I have a lot of conviction, I perceive it I low risk, or I have a long time horizon, I just let it do its thing and periodically check on the company to see if it's still worth holding. 

The risky bets are where I get my fix for my stock gambling addiction, which prevents me from overly controlling my long term positions"
2021-05-24 04:04:32,stocks,I put 2.5k into stocks in March last year and it's turned into 4.4k and climbing still. People say not to try to time the market but boy did I ever.
2021-05-24 11:27:47,stocks,"I started actually getting into stock stuff this year; up until then I just put money into SPY in an ira I had through my company and thought nothing of it.

I went from ""I don't even look at the market, I just buy SPY when I can"" to manically checking the price of a stock over and over again. I lost roughly $650 chasing trends, had a few days where I felt sick watching money evaporate, and changed my course after a week. I think I have a better relationship with stocks/investments now; I took up blue-chip buy and hold investing, with a focus on dividends and compounding interest, here's a list of all the things I've changed my outlook on, or learned, in the past few months:

1) every penny in the market is ""lost"", I'll never see it again; I don't expect my investments to fail, per say, but I do only invest what I can stomach never using again. Especially this for the fact that I'm expecting to eventually subsist off dividends alone, I don't expect to ever sell what I've bought unless they cut or stop paying a dividend entirely, so that money really will never go back to me in theory.

2) green days are nice, but red days are better. Since I'm buying as holding for the long run, a stock going down in value isn't the worst thing ever; I get to look at the news around why is dropping, if the news is insignificant and the drop seems to be driven by FUD, it let's me buy the stock at a lower price. If there's actually a good reason for the price to drop, it let's me evaluate the stock to see if I want to bounce or not.

3) look at overall values, not day to day. Today a stock investment of mine is down by about 3 dollars, but the total value is up by around 70 dollars. Temporary dips are fine, and worrying about them is foolish.

4) take comfort in an entire market crash; a week or so ago we had a huge correction in the market, I lost a lot of my unrealized gains from it, but I was fine with it. If 1 stock goes down you might worry that it's a bad play. If every stock, either in a sector or across sectors, goes down? That's just a crash, it's not based on fundamentals changing, or problems with my stocks' company, or anything that justifies the stock losing value, it's just a sale.

5) pay attention to the news, but only act on the important stuff. All the previous rules rely on this, if I hear JNJ comes out and says ""it turns out our products cause mega death cancer and also our CEO kicks puppies and orphans for fun. We refuse to apologize and will continue to do this."" That might be a good time to sell; the red day isn't just a regular dip, the fundamentals I trusted changed, the overall values are now important to pay attention to too see the reaction, it's different now, so it's fine to act on it. If you see class action lawsuits or a pipeline gets shafted during planning or some controversy about a training video circulates, it'll be a blip on the company, so don't sweat it. Don't worry about the small stuff, just act on the big issues."
2021-05-24 17:35:57,stocks,"My strategy is to only buy stocks that I see blowing up or being around in 5-10 years. I only buy when 



A) People are panicking

B) The stock is dropping along with the rest of it's sector 

C) Routine bad news comes out about the company (for ex, union works protesting, legal issue, etc.)



And the only time I sell is when I seriously think it's overvalued.

2021-05-24 00:00:00,stocks,"Get out or go to sleep for now? I started buying stocks 2 years ago all the way through corona. Mostly it is boring stocks like XOM, BASF or SLM and ETFs (NASDAQ, China, healthcare...). Also I buy rather small packages of $2000 per Stock/etf.
So far the overall performance is okay (+20%) - given I also bought before Corona.
Since 2 month or so everything started to go up and down, dividend season is almost over. 

In addition I pay for my house as a second pillar.
I don't aim to become rich or retire at 40. I would like to have a sensible investment strategy, I have no target timewise, no goal, no pressure.

My question now is if I should sell all and wait for a good opportunity to buy again? Trading fees will likely cost ~2% of the portfolio - should I stay invested and wait, maybe keep extra money for now? 
All companies I am invested in seem to be doing okayish business-wise. XOM is still down 10% , some other 30% - but during Corona even the most solid companies droped 40% easy.

So do I hold or should I do something?

Thanks!"

I just like watching it. Some are panicking some are calm as can be. And I suppose if there are a certain amount of people selling there must be an equal amount of people buying.

If you can't sleep at night it might be a good idea to reevaluate your situation. And slowly adjust so it's something you are comfortable with. You didn't by garbage which is a good thing. For stocks I find looking at long term charts helps. The crashes disappear into a long upward trend."
2021-05-23 22:05:31,stocks,"If you're in 'boring' stuff that's usually pretty stable then waiting around for a covid-like event again could mean you're sitting on the sidelines for years. 

But let's say you do that and the next event hits... when are you going to buy back in?  That's the million dollar question that even the best investors can't do.  It's catching the falling knife.  It's only easy in retrospect to say 'I could've gotten that stock at 40% off!'.  

More than likely you pull the trigger somewhere between the start of the drop and bottom.  So you bought on 'sale' at say 20% off, only to watch it drop another 20%... while pooping your pants.  

I'll speak for myself... I've got pretty much all of my money on the table in safe-ish stuff.  Cause timing the market for me is hard."
2021-05-23 22:04:26,stocks,"Would you buy at current price? If so, hold, if not sell. If your afraid of the current market that's fine, it is ok to hold cash, but you have to be ok missing out on gains. I'm a believer it's better to be always in rather than try to time top/bottom. 

Will we get a drawdown at some point? Likely IMO but you cant time the top or the bottom so I thinks it's generally wise to just stay long."

2021-05-24 01:28:31,stocks,since you haven’t bought trash your sticks will bounce back its just a matter of when. my strategy for the current crash is picking things that are well established and are almost guaranteed to survive and continue to buy more every time it drops. in 5 years it will pay off big time..... I’m hoping.
2021-05-24 09:47:18,stocks,"Are you in the USA or somewhere else like in Europe? In the USA, you can sign up with E*Trade, Interactive Brokers, Schwab etc. etc. or you can get an account with Fidelity or Vanguard. All these allow you to invest in US total market or SP500 index funds without transaction fees.

It sounds to me like you are relatively young and also based on the other things you said, I think you should just keep saving and investing in low cost index funds in a temporally diversified manner (dollar cost averaging). Think about it like this: if you intend to keep investing for a long time, then the amount that you will buy in the future will be much greater than what you have so far. Your current buying so far, will eventually contribute < 10% to your total portfolio in the end (when you're 60+ or whatever). So it really doesn't matter in the long run even if the market crashes from here and stays low for 10 or even 20 years, as long as you stay employed and retain purchasing power to keep buying stocks (also just imagine how much you'd end up earning from dividends alone in a scenario like this).

So that's the baseline. From here, if you want to do anything, I would say start learning (and I mean seriously learning) about investing in stocks. I recommend index funds as a safe way to get started, but you need to get it out of your head that only ""smart professionals"" can make intelligent investments in individual stocks. This topic has been discussed extensively on this forum and elsewhere, but let me just mention that it has been shown that just by mechanically copying Berkshire Hathaway 13Fs and equally weighing their public stock portfolio investments, you would have beaten the SP500 over time. So it is not impossible. In fact it's simple, but it's not easy and your own knowledge of investing and about yourself and your own psychology will determine whether you'll do better or worse than average.

To summarize: don't sell. If you don't know anything, keep buying total market / large cap index funds in a temporally distributed manner. If you want to do better, start learning and studying investment and accept that this will take years (or longer) but that is fine because while you learn, you can keep sitting on your index fund investments."

But then you're betting on something happening for the first time in history, although we also saw something else happen for the first time in history last year.

To be honest, I would bet on us not seeing something unprecedented happen two years in a row however. When we finally see a deeper dip it would not shock me at all if it was simply another 2018 (and I've been guessing that's next year).

Yes many are new to this, and excited. But I believe any quest toward increasing their knowledge base should be supported and not condemned for being incorrect, just gently corrected.

Ok...so which competencies does that random mod have? What degrees does he hold, and where are they from? Is he a a 50 year investing veteran with experience in US and international/foreign markets? Does he hold a masters in economics? A practicing partner at a financial law firm? A multi million dollar hedge fund manager? [Or is he another 25 year old kid who happened to end up sucked into the GME fiasco?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGVY2Kco8ng) Based on his age I'm guessing hes not a senior partner, isn't a long term investor, and he probably doesn't hold a PHD in economics tho that one is possible, if so good for him. 

If not, this peer review and paper fall apart based on the definition you linked... or those who are reviewing it are incompetent, that could be true too. Which would you prefer? Go look at this mods post history. Its all GME, hes fallen for the same fucking garbage far to many of you have. This would be more hilarious to watch if it wasn't so sad.

A real accountant, or a WSB accountant? Either way I'm not sure that qualifies him as a peer to those people you described, but maybe it does I suppose

>It's not necessarily focused on GME, more so describing how the markets are flawed and/or set up in a way that harms retail investors.

Again, this is not new, ground breaking or even notable. Everyone knows the market favors the rich, the insiders, the hedge funds, the money makers, and on and on. Why do you think so many people ask things like ""Everyone in my life tells me the stock market is for the rich, not guys like me is this true?"" People have known for decades the bullshit that goes on in the markets. Accept it and trade and invest around it, or don't. People have made lots of money despite this house of cards burning for decades. Perhaps people could try the Japanese markets instead.

>I'd rather have some faith this could work, and end up wrong, than be as bitter and demeaning as you are.

Faith that...what could work? I guess I'm confused. What is going to ""work""? You'd rather believe that the whole market will collapse because GME isn't mooning? That the DCT is what...corrupt and everything is burning? If you believed this and that person also believed that, and the people at superstonk believed that too, diamond fucking hands seems like the opposite message to convey. The market is collapsing...hold all your shares, that makes no sense. I don't think 3 people peer reviewing an accountants work from reddit is enough to convince me or the majority of others that the house of cards is collapsing. Instead ""Diamond F\*cking Hands"" because after all, it will recover."

This allowed Melvin and citadel to get out of the short side they fucked up on..

This cut off the head of the MOASS trade, shorts shorted the new top and now the resistance barrier is almost impenetrable because large players like chammath are not playing with retail here anymore.  

The price action currently on GME is almost entirely driven by retail apes jerking each other off.

The squeeze squoze.  Stocks don’t make 6000% gains usually and your comparison to VW is so r3tarded they are nothing the same..  the dynamics are incomparable.

If you know anything about squeeze dynamics you would realise a squeeze on a stock with 140% SI being 'squoze' would result in much more than 40 dollars to 400.

I guess the choice is binary. 

You can open your mind and listen to industry leaders such as lucy komisar, carl harberg and susanne trimbath. These individuals have put decades of work into this area and all agree GME is still heavily shorted. 

Or you can ignore their expertise and continue to lap up the bullshit pumped out by marketwatch,cnbc, motley fool etc.

So it’s sad but maybe in 5 years it will be worth it’s current value.  You missed the trade when it was under 10$

The MOASS “IS” dead.  It requires friendly hedge funds and large players the same as during the first squeeze, but after what happened with congress no big players are going to fuck around with something that hot anymore, for big players, the trade is over.  Big players don’t double dip into something like this.

Keep on breathing that hopium though, I’m just letting you know the facts.  

It’s not a big conspiracy.  There WAS a systemic issue when the SI was over 100% but that is no longer an issue."

You really need to question your investing when you trade based on hope.  You are HOPING there’s a huge conspiracy and everyone is hiding numbers, and HOPING a squeeze will happen again, and HOPING short interest is higher than reported.  

How long have you been trading?  I’ve been trading Daily for a living now for 2 years and trades through the whole COVID crash.

You on the other hand FOMO’d into a stock that had already shot up several 100% - and appear to be convinced you should chase it even More.

My question for you is, does the company have a viable plan for the future yet?  No.  they don’t.  If they do please link me.

And second question - if Robinhood and citadel changes the rules during the first squeeze, what makes you think they will not do that again, and or why can’t they just permanently bend the rules here if they are actually screwed in some way due to falsely reported numbers?  

I mean they already control the media and the numbers right?  I guess they’ll just let it go to 10 million, many times more than the entire worlds GDP, 

and we will all live a doomsday market crash (except for you and your digital, fungible shares that you don’t even own will somehow be able to be cashed out?  Lol)

Yes robinhood will almost certainly pull more shenanigans during the squeeze. Their paymaster is citadel after all. I feel bad for those who dont and cant move to another broker. Thousands of customers have already transferred to fidelity alone.

Not hoping there is more than enough evidence if you actually look for it. You raise a good point about the rules being changed. Recently a number of regualtory changes  have been passed by the SEC which paint a powetful picture of whats to come. Google OCC-004 and OCC- 003 , if only for curiosity. Or dont, the choice is yours. 

The SEC /DTCC are preparing for a nuclear bomb and are battening down the hatches in order to isolate the damage and reduce a wider negative market impact.

My point is that this is much bigger than you realise. This is why it is so hard for people to get onboard as the whole scenario seems improbable. I get it. Call me a flat earther etx but all the evidence points to it.

I could call you out  for selling so low but i wont. Profit is profit at the end of the day. All i will say is this is the definition of an asymmetric bet. Pick up a share just for the fun of it. You have been trading for 2 years im sure you can afford it.

I could care less cause it’s bullshit.  None of that proves GameStop is going to be a viable business in the digital gaming age.  They have proven nothing, and they still don’t have an actual plan yet.  Do they?  I’d like to see.  

And yeah I still have some shares for fun but that’s all - I’m not expecting to make much more than I already did in the first squeeze - and yes, it’s rigged, so I go with what works, and right now I don’t make much from GME.

Big players are buying up all the silver to bankrupt the COMEX and LBMA and fuck up JP Morgan.  All said and done, when their short positions have to be covered, they will need our physical silver to cover their paper derivatives.  It’s like GME but for real cause physical silver is actually something the big banks will need from us.  They won’t need your synthetic GME shares if the market goes belly up.

2021-05-24 09:17:13,stocks,"A stock’s price should not be the only reason you pick a stock. 

At the current dividend of $0.42/share, you would need to own 2,380.95 shares to be receiving $1,000 in dividends.

Keep in mind you will owe taxes on those dividends, so whatever tax bracket you fall into will influence the amount in dividend taxes you pay."
2021-05-24 12:57:09,stocks,"If you're 16 years old you should be investing in things like VOO and VTI.. Long term growth that will yield a lot more, then as you get older you should start taking profits on portions of those and shifting into less risky dividend kings. Right now you can afford some risk in your life, its not like you're gambling away your retirement savings yet.

Also if you want to determine how much you need  to earn 1K a year off of just KO dividends just do the math. Without factoring in growth of dividends or a DRIP strategy you would need to have \~32,900 invested if you bought today.

(1000/1.68) \* 54.50 = $32,963. || (Target dividend / annualized dividend) \* Current Price = X"

2021-05-24 00:04:25,stocks,If you’re under age 50 you should not be looking for dividends. Dividends are when the company pays out their profit INSTEAD OF REINVESTING it in the company. Dividend company’s underperform against just about everything.

2021-05-24 15:50:54,stocks,"You don't seem to be getting that there more to investing them dividends...

You buy a stock for $1, in ten years you sell it for $10. You made $9. Most often this kind of growth sale gives more profit than a dividend stock that stays the same price but gives dividends.

 You usually want more focus or weight in dividend stocks when you're older because they keep your investment value more stable while providing income when retiring.

Compound interest is a good way to invest but create more capital by investing more and more into growth"

2021-05-23 21:16:31,stocks,"I agree with your take. If the OP is JUST looking for dividends there are plenty of income funds (FAGIX on Fidelity is a good one) that compound monthly. Why buy dividend stocks and carry the risk of bear markets, product recalls, etc? 

Maybe try to split the difference with growth/value stocks. Apple and Disney pay a small dividend and also offer the potential for growth, albeit it much less than others in their segments."
2021-05-24 10:51:55,stocks,Anytime i tell ppl i wanna invest they say things like omgggggg it isnt a growth stock it doesnt reinvest in itself like who cares man pays good dividends
2021-05-23 21:34:16,stocks,He has not died but he has left a will for what to do after his death and has spoke about it several times.  If you are thinking long term he suggest Vanguard and  putting part in a bond etf like 10%and the rest in growth etf though he didn’t name them out exactly but I would say VTI and or VOO ETF’s
2021-05-23 21:26:27,stocks,Apple is not that good of a company tbh  and very expensive need one tjat hasnt alrdy grown

Buying simply dividend stock is for when you have say a million dollars banked and need to make 6% a year to live off those dividends.   ETF’s do a lot of that work for you if you are slowly investing."

2021-05-23 21:48:00,stocks,"Sounds like you should take some time learning before investing.   Else you will learn the hard or expensive way.   Look up what an ETF does.  It is a grouping of stocks.  Some etf make money through selling shares, in dividends, and some make it on growth.  VOO and VTI you should be able to enter into any stock brokerage as the ticker and it will pull them up.

Or go to etf.com.  And it will tell you what all stocks are in a specific ETF and what their major holding are."

2021-05-24 00:00:00,stocks,"Let’s talk AAPL Everyone seems to love AAPL with good reason. It’s consistent growth and rising dividend and stock buybacks, followed by tons of company cash makes it an easy recommendation. They are a market leader in almost every field they touch. 

However the price of the stock hasn’t moved since August 2020. That’s right at about 10 months of 0 growth. In that same time, VTI has gone up roughly +24%. (Yes I know Apple had a huge run up before August 2020, but I’m talking about now)

Currently I have about 15% of my portfolio in Apple stock. I am debating selling it and moving the funds to **VTI**. That would still net me 5% exposure to Apple. 

What does everyone else think? 

Is it worth continuing to hold your Apple shares after a year of no growth?"
2021-05-24 07:35:55,stocks,"> (Yes I know Apple had a huge run up before August 2020, but I’m talking about now)

But that huge run up matters now and always, it didn't just run up a little bit, it covered few years in its run up.  It doesn't need to do anything for few more years to still be top tier stock because of that run up."

Sell your Apple shares and invest it into a company that just buys shares of other companies. Don’t need to understand what those companies do, because it’s literally hundreds of them. A whole index if you will. What about the shit companies in those indexes? Fuck it, we’ll buy it too.

2021-05-24 05:09:51,stocks,I still think AAPL outperforms the market over the next 10 years. Just hold it.
2021-05-24 08:44:25,stocks,"Often quoted, paraphrased:

Only buy stocks in a company where you understand the business.

At a very basic level this can be construed as: understand all the market forces and why and when the company will make profit/continue to make profit. This can further be simplified: input cost < Output price.

Now let's see what business you are buying: stocks of a company. If this company is well managed and you understand what the management is doing then you are in a good position to decide whether to invest or not. You are now a manager of stocks, your aim is to understand the input(cash)/output(return from the underlying company)/\*hedging/generating cash-flow\*. If you don't understand all the tools you should be in ETF's or similar.

If you have a 15% exposure to a stock and are unable to hedge/generate cash-flow etc from the stock then you should hand over the reins to someone else(ETF's, pro money managers etc)."

I have been long AAPL since 2008 and had 1000% profits, and sold at several points in 2020 and 2021, and now I own no AAPL, which feels really weird. I love the company and its products, and the M1 chips are going to change the computing landscape as much as the original Bondi Blue iMac changed computing, but after a long up move it's natural things will take time to resume upwards movements. Remember that corrections can come in the form of down movements, or they can come as sideways movements. Then things can start to improve, if earnings and execution stay as good as they are."

2021-05-24 13:37:17,stocks,I think a lot of the market shares this sentiment and is shifting a little bit of money toward dividend and etf’s. I wouldn’t call it scared money but the tried and true way is strong holds in good stocks.

So I was debating trimming off the Apple section since I already get exposure to it and let the total market index do it’s thing."

2021-05-23 23:15:59,stocks,I think a lot of these companies are overvalued in the traditional sense but you're paying for the longevity and growth. Like most people use a 10 year period for a DCF valuation but Apple has been around a lot longer than that. Amazon has been 'overvalued' for pretty much its entire existence. If you still like the company personally I would just hold and let the stock do its thing for a few years. They tend to spike up at fairly random times so holding for a long period means you don't miss those times where stock price meets valuation.

2021-05-23 20:11:57,stocks,Go for LIFO to accumulate long term investments and pay less tax
2021-05-23 22:55:33,stocks,FIFO by default unless you specify.
2021-05-24 00:24:10,stocks,"Shares you held at least one year get taxed at the long term rate. If you are adding to your position then you are buying more shares and each share is tracked in your account.  So when you sell your shares, you know exactly how long you’ve held each share for and they get taxed accordingly. Typically the default setting for most brokerages is FIFO or first in, first out for shares. Meaning unless directed otherwise, your oldest shares always get sold first when you hit the sell button. 

Honestly if you’re using Robinhood I noticed the app really sucks for showing you any of this cost basis information. Maybe the actual website shows more. If you are investing alot of money I would eventually move over to a real brokerage firm like Fidelity or Schwab where you will have more tools."
2021-05-23 21:19:45,stocks,"Your custodian will track your purchase dates and cost basis every time you purchase stocks.  Many custodians will allow you to chose which lots you want to sell.  You generally will want to sell the lots with the highest cost basis first, to minimize taxes.  Be cautious for wash sales"
2021-05-23 22:57:57,stocks,"There should be an option for FIFO, or First In First Out. That way you sell your oldest shares first."
2021-05-23 20:01:02,stocks,"FIFO but you can designate at the time the order to sell is placed,"
2021-05-23 20:13:37,stocks,"In the long reply about the brokerage to use never saw an answer to your question.

Your brokerage will keep track of when you purchased the stock and each purchase so it will be properly split between long and short along with the original cost.

If you were to be holding the stock outside of brokerage then there are a bunch of requirement in keeping track of the date yourself."
2021-05-23 20:50:28,stocks,Split up.
2021-05-23 22:42:58,stocks,"Each trade stands on its own and the cost basis is the cost of the stock and the fees associated as the cost basis.  How long that you own each of these trades before you liquidate (sell) them determines if they are short term or long term.  Say you buy 100 shares of xyz. You sell 50 in 6 months.  Those are short term.  You hold the other 50 shares for a year or longer, then when ever you sell those 50 shares are taxed at a long term basis.  So if you buy 100 shares on Jan 1, then 50 on feb 1, then 200 on March 1, the cost basis is what you paid when you purchased each of those lots and the 100 is short term until Jan 1 the next year and the 50 shares are short term until feb 1 the next year and the 200 are short term until March 1 the next year.  Does that help?"
2021-05-23 22:45:52,stocks,Depends on country. Some countries only allow FIFO
2021-05-23 22:52:19,stocks,"FIFO and LIFO

Learn them to start"
2021-05-24 00:08:30,stocks,"It depends on how long you hold each lot.
Your lot of 61k bought in March 2021 would not be considered long term until March 2022.
Your original purchase in 2018 would be considered long term at this point.
Once you have held the position long for a year, you should cross from short term to long term.
With this being an equity, these are covered and your broker is required to track your basis info and report the info when they are sold to the IRS and to you.
I could go on. I do cost basis related work for a large investment firm."

2021-05-24 03:24:20,stocks,I need pay taxes on stock gains?!?!
2021-05-24 08:47:55,stocks,"Some brokers let you pick a tax strategy. As in first in first our or last in, first out. Robinhood only allows first in first out. You may have both long and short term in one trade."
2021-05-24 10:41:41,stocks,"If you sell the whole portfolio, it will split up based on their short / long position status and taxed accordingly."

2021-05-23 20:25:45,stocks,What
2021-05-23 22:18:27,stocks,Longterm after a year.
2021-05-24 04:48:19,stocks,good question
2021-05-24 06:10:40,stocks,"FIFO, right?"
2021-05-24 06:57:12,stocks,"The axiom I've heard is last in first out, but brokerage should optimize to sell your shares from least value gains to highest value gains but usually offer an option for your to specify which to sell if you so choose."
2021-05-24 07:59:45,stocks,FIFO on gains only
2021-05-24 09:21:43,stocks,"It's split, the 100K are long term, the 61 are short term, if you sell right now.  If you wait a year, the 61 slide over into long term too."
2021-05-24 13:21:41,stocks,"I always keep good records of trades, then report gain/loss on the average cost. I've been doing this for decades.🤞"
2021-05-24 14:13:11,stocks,"That would depend on where you pay taxes I believe.
Here in portugal it is first in first out."
2021-05-24 13:37:52,stocks,Research it for yourself.
2021-05-24 10:41:31,stocks,Why isn't FIFO the default? Why would anyone want to sell LIFO?
2021-05-24 02:11:54,stocks,that's not up to the law?
2021-05-23 21:12:45,stocks,Nah genuinely curious because I’ve had it since 2018 threw 40 bucks into some crappy stock and it’s going through a R/M right now
2021-05-23 21:06:04,stocks,Looks like trash looking at the long term chart...
2021-05-23 21:06:36,stocks,Same. Lol
2021-05-24 07:47:49,stocks,Not always. Many brokerages allow you to select specific lots when selling so you can manage your tax impact.

2021-05-24 15:46:18,stocks,"""I do cost basis related work for a large investment firm.""

Maybe I can ask you: I inherited a handful of blue chip stocks when my dad died and they spent decades in a brokerage account reinvesting dividends. In 2012, I stopped the reinvestments and moved the majority into Schwab. I kept a stock keeping record form since the time I was a kid until 2012 tracking the dividend reinvestments, splits, spinoffs, etc. Is this form all I need to some how figure out my cost basis? Is there a simpler way to do this or an expert I can solicit? Any advice would be appreciated!

I really want to sell and go with the Bogleheads strategy after my GE wild ride.  

Schwab couldn't help me move Certificated shares out of Computershare. I tracked down my old certificates and need to get those moved too."

2021-05-24 16:22:32,stocks,"It can be complicated to a lay person and when in doubt, find a CPA to double check your work.
A couple of things come to mind:
1. You are ahead of most people if you’ve been keeping track of all the dividend reinvestment, splits and any spin offs (which can be non taxable and have a basis allocation between the 2 or be taxable).
2. Anything you inherited should have an acquisition date that matches the decedent’s date of death and a FMV as of that date (there are some flourishes and alternates to this, but this is the case 99.9% of the time). These should all be considered long term as well, even if they were acquired the day before the date of death. If these equities were acquired on or before 12/31/10, they would be uncovered (which means when you sell them, the broker must report the term and proceeds to you and the IRS but they do not have to supply the cost basis info, original acquisition date,etc). Any equity acquired on or after 01/01/2011 is covered and the broker would have to report all of those data points to you and the IRS.
I mentioned the covered dates because with inherited positions, you can roll the tax lots up but you’d do it in one group of uncovered and one group of covered.
If it was all stocks (or equities as we call them) you inherited, the above is true. If you have any mutual funds, options or bonds, it’s the same just a hair different on the dates for the covered status (the IRS rolled out what securities became covered between 2011 and 2016).
Computer share is a MFer to work with but I’m surprised Schwab wasn’t willing to help you out on those. I’m not involved with that process but I’m fairly positive if you’ve got the certificates, you might have to sign a couple of docs or provide some documentation to get those converted at my Firm.
GE has been wild, but old shares of T are the absolute worst to try and figure things out on if they were acquired anytime before the mid 2000’s from what I remember."

I tended to side with hedge funds and MM’s (as much as you can ‘side with’ reality lol) during the GME ‘debates’ as well so I probably have a different outlook than most here. The margin rate on robinhood is definitely unbeatable too.

Fidelity is great for my retirement and dividend portfolios though; just a less user-friendly interface and I honestly have far more problems with fidelity fucking up my account than I do robinhood.

2021-05-23 20:48:25,stocks,They do not buy your shares from the market. The take your money and give you an iou. So if 100 people each drop 1m into a stock on robinhood the market price will not be effected. No shares were actually bought by robinhood.

I don’t expect much to happen in June first it’s just a sort of formality to terminate the custodianship but in the month after it could become very lucrative. Conservative price predictions on this would be around 10 cents IMO but I would look for more DD if you want to know more
2021-05-24 00:35:23,stocks,"Basically these are reverse merger plays where a defunct shell gets taken over by the custodians, Moody and DeNunzio, then a valuable company wishing to be traded publicly merges into the shell, converting your shares of the shell 1:1 into shares of the new, merging company. You're essentially buying diamonds for the price of dirt. That's why this has gone up 10,000% from late 2020 to date (from $0.0001 to a recent high of $0.045, currently above $0.01). That interest and volume is coming from the pending merger. Chart continues to build itself out beautifully with the 50 day SMA acting as support."
2021-05-23 23:58:02,stocks,"Look at the charts for NXMH, KAVL (bought that at 6 cents this time last year, sold at $2.60 in January), FTRK, BSPI (bought that at $0.002 last summer, recently above $0.40), and now CPSL. I've made a ton of money on these plays. CPSL and FTRK are next in line to merge. No reverse splits to get to those prices. Moody and DeNunzio do mergers the right way. Very profitable opportunities, especially at these low penny levels."

My personal fave, Charles Schwab, or Mr. Charley, I think halted GME trading for like an hour back in Feb compared to robbinghood, whom halted buying for many stocks for a long period of time.

2021-05-24 12:42:17,stocks,"> to learn with on Robinhood a couple of weeks ago before reading this sub
  
Take this sub with a grain of salt - there's a bit of an anti-RH circle jerk. (watch what happens to this comment). In my opinion it's a great way to learn and start investing - and solid if you just want to do more longterm passive investing. If you want to get into more involved tactics like options or day trading, you'll eventually want to move elsewhere. 
  
I was a newbie 4 years ago. Downloaded Robinhood with a few hundred bucks and now have around $80k (up ~140%) in the app. I only buy, almost never sell and don't mess with options or daytrading, so I only look at the app a couple times a day, if that."
2021-05-24 09:49:16,stocks,"So it depends on what you bought and what your desires are.  There is nothing wrong using RH unless you want to day trade and you might find yourself unable to sell immediately or similar.   If you cash out, you also will have to file a schedule A with your taxes now. That is now inevitable because you must keep records of all of your trades in and out of positions.   Did you buy one or more different investments?   Was the goal to have growth or share prices going up?  Or value that pays a dividend?

Edit - desires should be what it you strategy."

2021-05-24 12:22:03,stocks,"Short answer is any is better than RH lol. 

Use a legitimate broker or your ""free"" trading will probably cost you more in the long run when your sell order doesn't fill. Use a legitimate exchange for crypto like coinbase pro or kraken. 

If this is too complicated and you don't want to do the reading to equip yourself with the right knowledge to use these platforms, then seriously consider just putting your money in a Vanguard fund and don't bother much with individual stocks or crypto."

But you do you, buddy. I'm not going to tell you how to live your life. Just pointing out why there really aren't any valid excuses to use such a shit-tier app, when there are legitimate brokerages available to use instead.

Think of me next time you miss out on a bunch of money because Robinhood doesn't want your bet to pay off against their real customers (citadel, and the like, who they are selling your information to), and they halt your trades, or force you out of your position that will cause their buddies to lose if you are allowed to win.

There's a reason they openly refer to you, their users, as dumb money. They see you suckers coming from a million miles away.

There is no legitimate reason to not just get a big boy account."

I would assume that in order for a fraction share to be transacted on selling or buying, at some point a full share must be traded so there could be dynamics that might prevent you from selling or buying when you want.   Maybe I will read up on it now just so that I know.  The only time I could see me doing fractional transactions would be for stocks trading at sky high prices in thousands and even then, I doubt that I would play in fractional shares just because there are far too many choices to choose from."

2021-05-24 17:25:24,stocks,"RH got a bad rap when it had to halt trades due to the liquidity that RH (or any other broker) is required to have to back the transactions.  From what I read and saw in the congressional deep dive with Vlad, RH had a fiduciary duty to halt trading until they were above to fund all in play.  That’s my overly simplified view of what I watched in the virtual hearings and published details that were not “opinion”.

I’m likely to get downvoted like crazy for saying this, but I don’t care."
2021-05-24 10:03:57,stocks,"Ah gotcha. So I wanted to play around with both growth stocks and dividends since I’m basically just trying to learn at this moment. I bought 2 shares of POSH because I’ve sold over $100,000 on that app so I’m personally invested in it anyways, 2 shares of AGNC since I was interested in REITs, and they gave me a free share of LLNW. I’m guessing since it’s such a small amount of money it probably doesn’t matter at this point in time, but I’d rather not get started somewhere then have to go through the hassle of transferring everything."

POSH has gotten hammered and their PE ratio is negative so they are losing money.  Loo for the CEO strategy on how to be profitable.  You could put a Stop Loss order in that of the stock hits a certain price, it sells period so it  need to be where you want out and it must be outside of volatility swing ranges.

Effectively, they got margin called by the NSCC as the NSCC started to recognize the risk of these assets. Do you have a real reason for thinking that this isn’t the case?

You may not have seen this kind of “manipulation” in your years of trading, but these are different times.  You also have never witnessed such an influx of retail investors with so many financial instruments at their disposal, nor has there been such a departure from fundamental metrics as there has been with underlyings like AMC, GME, etc..

As an aside, I use TOS for the vast majority of my portfolio, but i still some options strategies (especially in low IV) that require free contracts - so I’m stuck with RH for a bit.  Afaik, they’re also the cheapest way to buy the popular coins."

When investing in a fund regardless of Index or Mutual someone else is managing all of the research, buying, selling and administrative duties.  You dont get the Dividends directly as you would by direct ownership of the stock, but if you look at funds over 20 years as an example, many are quite solid for the long haul return.  It is important to know the fees and details so that is calculated against your gains.

EDIT:

I should have said ""Market Index Funds"" above because the statement is not valid across all funds like Mutual funds and others.  Market index funds perform well over time.  Each of our goals should be to outperform the Index Funds.  Anything below that is less than average performance.  If you cant exceed Index funds, you have lost opportunity to make money."

2021-05-24 10:59:26,stocks,"NP.  I recommend that you search for a broker offering an incentive that they give you some cash with a minimum investment.  However, do not let that be why you choose them.   Fidelity sounds like they have much more capabilities and low/no cost trades.  I like Etrade's tools and its a low cost trading plaform, but no advice from the ""pros"".  There are many options so do the research and be patient.  If you want to get rich quick, you will likely get poor faster.   POSH could be a hidden gem, but I have no idea.  They need to generate cash somehow and pay the overhead and become profitable.  Sometimes the platform - Like Amazon as an example, makes money in ways that you did not understand.  Do the research on Amazon as your ""homework"".  Read the annual reports and the investor presentations.  I suspect that you will be surprised where the cash is generated versus what you thought.

One of the issues with trading on phones is a clean phone interface often cuts off info like order type, lot selection, etc. It is also difficult to keep track of data if you are switching between screens. When I am buying/selling I am updating my models and spreadsheets, running risk numbers, etc. It isn't important if you are entering market orders on long-term ETFs, but if you are trading individual stock or derivatives on your phone you likely aren't processing enough info to be making prudent decisions. It also trains you to use mental heuristics when trading. Most people who are trading actively on their phone aren't doing things like noting entry prices and volume, documenting anticipated exit points, etc."

2021-05-24 00:00:00,stocks,"Enthusiast Gaming: growing gaming media powerhouse I will assume that we all are aware of gaming being fast growing industry and profitable industry so I will skip general introduction and jump straight to discussing this company.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

In simple terms Enthusiast Gaming is company that aims to create massive gaming media network that then could be monetized by advertising, subscriptions, merchandise and content licensing. As such, its not not video games developer or publisher. It is more similar to advertising conglomerates like IPG, WPP or Omnicom who own many smaller agency businesses.

&#x200B;

>[https://postimg.cc/hzQgfHm2](https://postimg.cc/hzQgfHm2)

>Image visualizing Enthusiast Gaming overall structure.

&#x200B;

Currently, the company owns over 100 websites focusing on unique gaming  content (Destructoid, The escapist, Nintendo Enthusiasts, etc), YouTube channels with a combined 24 million+ subscribers (Wisecrack, The Squad, The Count Down, etc),  professional Esports teams such as Luminosity Gaming, influencers across  many different social media platforms, and it was responsible for  hosting live Esports events pre-COVID 19. Taken together, its platforms reach an audience of over 300 million gamers on a monthly basis. Enthusiast's esports subsidiary Luminosity Gaming owns teams  competing in Fortnite, Apex Legends, and a variety of other games. The  company helps Enthusiast get access to its own esports content and gain a  foothold in the $1 bil+ esports market.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

65 million of the 300 million monthly users are located in the U.S.  alone. This is important because when it comes to eventual monetization,  U.S. “eyes” are traditionally those that have the highest value. Half of every American male between the age of 18 and 34 visited at least one of the platforms owned by Enthusiast Gaming. This is an important  demographic, since it is one of the hardest-to-reach ones, and is one  the demographics that spends the most on non-essential goods and has a  larger lifetime value, since they are in the early stages of their  lives. The CEO mentions how 70% of the company's audience is either Gen Z or Millennials, with 65% of its audience spending more than 15  hours a week gaming. 67% of its platform users purchase more than 7 video games every year. Referring back to the importance of this demographic because it is hard to reach; an astounding 48% of Enthusiast Gaming’s audience do not use Facebook. Altogether, the company has amassed an  audience with significant potential for monetization if it is able to  execute on its strategies over the coming years.

Today, Enthusiast  has 110k+ subscribers, mostly from The Sim's Resource, and this number is up 50% YTD, generating slightly less than $2mil in revenue per  quarter. While management has rolled out subscriptions across a few individual  properties like The Sims Resource, Escapist, and Siliconera, they are  working on putting together an integrated subscription that takes  advantage of their ownership across all these properties.

&#x200B;

>There’s a much bigger play that we can offer customers, and we are  spending a lot of time figuring out how to nail it. That’s our approach,  because nobody can offer, the things that we can offer. And so, we  think our best chance for transformative penetration and transformative  growth on the subscription side is an integrated offer.

&#x200B;

As one of the largest content creators in the gaming industry, with ownership of multiple YouTube  channels as well as esports team, it's only natural that Enthusiast  would enter the content licensing space. In the future, esports and  gaming content will replace a good chunk of sports and other content  available on OTT services today, in my opinion, as 60% of Gen Z people  prefer esports over traditional sports. Today, Enthusiast has already licensed out their BCC Gaming content to Samsung's OTT service, and there should be more deals done in the next few years.

After all these monetization streams, Enthusiast is also planning to  monetize through e-commerce and social networking. However, since this  is still several years out, management has not given much detail on  this.

&#x200B;

>And then, down the road, we have more focus on ecommerce and creating  a marketplace, as well as developing a social network, which we’re  pretty excited about.

&#x200B;

In addition, recently acquired Omnia Media is a keystone in the YouTube  ecosystem, providing services to over 500 influencers, including  well-known influencers with millions of subscribers. Omnia Media also  owns its own YouTube channels like Wisecrack and BCC Gaming that produce original content.

Overall, gaming is  going to continue its strong growth and Enthusiast is well-positioned to  capitalize on this trend by helping to connect gamers around the world.  In addition, the company is expected to show strong growth over the  next few years yet its valuation is low compared to other gaming  leaders.

For disclosure, I have not got any position in Enthusiast Gaming. Above are just snippets of the research I've been doing and what some analysts are saying. I would like to hear your opinion on this company too.

2021-05-23 23:09:55,stocks,"After 5 years of gamergate for many gaming media automatically links peoples neuron connections to woke crap.

Then again now that i think more deeply about it, with very few exceptions, as far as gaming media goes, even your mentioned ones, almost everyone hates them, sometimes with burning passion. 

Problem for gamers is that companies have ''monopolized'' whatever they are offering, where else will they go to get your fix of whatever they want ? There is just no content on those obscure places even if someone finds them. Grudgingly they will swallow their 4th add in 10 minutes and keep going there, they will get past controversies after controversies and still use them, situation which makes twitch, youtube and likes very rich.

Then again we never took a look how their business is doing, might be earning mad cash, but since its not mentioned its quite a red flag, even r/pennystocks whips out numbers in their pump and dump posts, as this post i just commented on speculative aspects of it.

&#x200B;

>A streamer can mess up and lose their fans at any time

Not just that, if someone becomes target of cancel culture, whole companies associated with them can become targets too. Small chance of it being relevant one day.

Edit: took a look at financials, by the metrics it should rather be considered a pennystock. Growth they have is very huge, then again i don't know the market, so idk if its the circumstances or the company being amazing, can't make that judgement. They make that growth with debt and offerings dilluting the shares, and they are going to keep doing these 2 things, which makes its quite a gamble if investors by end of the day will be left with money, will beat the market etc.

They are also bringing stars like NFL star Richard Sherman and collaboration with Coldplay. Personally in pennystock world i consider it a big pump when I actively start recognizing the star names being bought. Which means properly timing this stock can become very essential to keeping the wallet intact. Stock price peaked up 500% past year(classic for stocks being mentioned at reddit), that is a lot of growth they still have to deliver on, anyone investing in it better believe the company for real, if the circumstances are not what investors predict, there is a possibility of heavy bags. Opposite is also the same, since its basically a pennystock area, it could go up few hundred % just as easely. A lot more to look into it, not just ''gaming so big'' to make that guess."
2021-05-24 00:00:00,stocks,"Estate/Inheritance tax on US or UK stocks for a foreigner Hey guys, I really appreciate you taking the time to read my post and help me. I hope you can bear with me through my inexperience and confusion

I am from Serbia, living in Serbia. With that in mind, I realized that my personal investments in US stocks will be liable to a 60% tax upon death (inheritance to my kids)

According to this [irs post](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/some-nonresidents-with-us-assets-must-file-estate-tax-returns) ,  Certain deceased nonresidents who were not citizens of the United States are subject to U.S. estate taxation with respect to their U.S.-situated assets. They also list stock of corporations under us law as an example of something that would fall under us law.

Am I wrong to say that I (my kids) will be liable for a high US estate tax and talking to the IRS upon death?

With that, I have a follow up question, and that is, how do these rules apply to me buying UK stocks. Here, I have not found any posts that specifically reference non citizen, non residents. The closest to that I found was this [gov.uk](https://www.gov.uk/tax-uk-income-live-abroad/selling-or-inheriting-assets) which says that you only pay inheritance tax on land, but then also on the same page says shares could also be liable for the tax??? This link also might be talking about people who moved out of the uk, and not me (who has never been an uk citizen or resident)"

One solution is to invest in Ireland ETFs: [https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Nonresident\_alien\_investors\_and\_Ireland\_domiciled\_ETFs#:\~:text=No%20Irish%20taxes%20of%20any%20kind%20for%20Ireland%20domiciled%20ETFs&text=](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Nonresident_alien_investors_and_Ireland_domiciled_ETFs#:~:text=No%20Irish%20taxes%20of%20any%20kind%20for%20Ireland%20domiciled%20ETFs&text=)...,arising%20on%20their%20underlying%20investments.

as Serbia does not have a double tax treaty with US it is tax efficient.

However, if you use a US broker that could be a problem still.   (i.e. Interactive Brokers ). I didn't check the details.

If you use local brokers, i.e. for Serbia that would be TradeWin24 and Komercijalna, one of the countries, either Serbia or Ireland have to process the inheritance under international laws. The process might be tricksy.

If you are married you can switch to a joint brokerage account to lower possible US tax liabilities."

Can someone possibly explain to me why I’m wrong. I hope I’m wrong. But the more I think about this the more it looks like a select few people at the top are able to literally create shares, thus controlling the direction of any and all stocks on the market. 

This basically means the entire stock market, AKA the “free” market is entirely rigged. 

They might’ve created a huge bull trap for GME if what I’m saying is true and will eventually let it drop to shit with more fake shares pulling the price down. 

We literally watched them stop the sale of shares earlier this year when GME first went viral. This could of been a moment where they needed to figure out what to do. Once they got everyone at their firms onboard they re-enabled buying shares for meme stocks. 


Why should anyone be investing in the stock market right now? Will the market crash from this? My original fear from the GME fiasco was a market crash. Then it slowly kept going back up after the initial turbulence. What if these people are making fake shares for the biggest companies out there like Apple and Google in order to create a fake stock market reality. And theoretically they could keep it going or short the market to shit and reap their reward."

2021-05-24 00:00:00,stocks,"Cruise stock holders, when are you selling? I bought CCL/CUK (Carnival Corp) starting late April last year and made it 100% of my portfolio. Now it is up around 100% (mostly long term gains) and I recently reflected if my hypothesis for the stock was seen through.

Frankly I did not expect to hold so long. I bought expecting a faster return to normal and if I knew in advance they wouldn't sail in the US until July 2021 I would assume it would be a bad investment. 

However, now they are confirmed to sail in July. I guess the hype that is left would be the cruises actually sailing successfully, and then the announcement of what they will do with their reserve cash ($11.5 billion compared to their usual $1 billion or less). They have around $26 billion in long-term debt (compared to $9 billion before the coronavirus) so I imagine it is a priority to pay off that. Then there are expenses of getting the cruises prepared to sail and upkeep. 

So even if CCL were to pay off $10 billion (maybe not the best use of funds) of their debt they would still be $6 billion more in debt than before the coronavirus with their dividend gone and shares heavily diluted.

In fact, their market cap is practically the same as it was pre-covid. In December 2019 they had a run up but the market cap now is actually higher than it was in November 2019. It would require billions in stock buybacks for the share price to rise to it's pre-covid levels (which included a dividend), on top of the billions needed to pay for debt/upkeep. Not to mention CCL was actually in a downtrend from 2018 on, with the market cap going from $50 billion to $30 billion.

So why would I hold now? Even if they have a successful year I'm having trouble justifying why they would continue to grow and outpace the SPY. 

Any other cruise stock holders? I've already started shifting money into a different investment that I have higher conviction will return healthy gains."
2021-05-24 00:27:52,stocks,"I sold CCL last week (for AMZN). Never discount retail psychology, people looking at things that don’t matter technically but mentally. Zoom out in the chart, CCL was in a dive long before COVID, but has NOW resumed its trend line pre-pandemic. 

For that reason alone, I was comfortable to take my profit elsewhere. With the added technicals, debt level, dilution, I was convinced. Gut decision, but it makes me money, just like it saved me money by jumping out 2 days before the 2020 crash started. 

That said, my gut still hasn’t given up on NCLH, so YMMV.

2021-05-24 00:00:00,stocks,"Increased ""competition"" in the EV space is bullish news for TSLA, not bearish **Disclaimer!** I'm not saying i'm bullish (or bearish) on TSLA, just that this particular argument is weak.

Many TSLA bears point out the risk of increased competition resulting from companies moving into the EV space, especially since nearly all major makes now have an EV either in production or in development. 

For one, most of these cars target a completely different customer. Simply, cars like the Nissan Leaf or Chevy Bolt aren't cutting into Tesla sales just like the Toyota Corolla isn't cutting into BMW 330i sales. While it's true that ""better"" or more luxury lines like the Audi E-Tron are coming out, they're still not quite there in terms of competitive features and price point. It's reasonable to think many customers who are buying a $70k car are willing to spending another $10k for significantly better range, a bigger battery, better charging infrastructure, falcon wing doors, etc. Think about it, how many Model Xs do you see on the road versus an Audi E-Tron or Jaguar I-PACE? Yes, those cars newer, but there are other reasons for their dismal sales too. So while there's going to be *some* buyers choosing these new EVs over a Tesla, it's not the doom and gloom that Tesla bears seem to think. IMO, The competition between EVs versus ICEs is much more significant than the competition between EVs.

Lastly and most importantly, this increase in ""competition"" just draw more attention to the EV market in general, which will always be good for Tesla and this is why Musk has always pushed for more competition in the EV space. For instance, if we take the current EV market to have a relative ""size"" or value of 1 and Tesla owns 90% of it, that's a size or value of 0.9 for Tesla. But if this competition and attention causes the EV market to grow to 3 but Tesla only owns 40% of it, that's still a size of 1.2 for Tesla."

2021-05-23 20:50:41,stocks,"Current birth rates aren't the problem, is fluctuations in birth rates that creates a problem

The US ""baby boomers"" are dying off, meaning there will be an upward pressure in commerce as the younger population has more money. A problem arises when a larger generation gets old and has to supported by the smaller younger generation. As the older generation (baby boomers) continue to die off, there will more flowing money in the economy since not as many elderly are sucking money out of healthcare, social security, retirement, etc - allowing more money to be allocated elsewhere. Our baby boom happened in the late 40s/50s, and is ending  70-90 years later. 

China had an inverse baby boom, many years of low birth rates (one child policy) that was preceded by a massive population expansion

The loss doesn't disappear, it just gets pushed on to the next purchase. You can still get the tax benefit, just not till you sell it again. Which could be this year or 5 years from now. You probably know that but just pointing it out for others"
2021-05-23 20:26:03,stocks,"Saying you want to exercise it after 30 days?

I don’t think it will be, as long as if you exercise the purchase is more than 30days after the day you sold for a loss. The day the stock is actually bought would be the day you exercise, 30+ days away so not trip a wash sale. 

I have never looked into doing it that way, so you might want to talk to a tax accountant for that."

Stock Y however tanks and you lose 30k. But you're planning to hold it for 10 years anyways. If there was no wash sale, you could sell Y at the bottom and buy it right back. Let's say all this happens at the end of December to make it easy. New year starts and you only have to pay taxes on 70k instead of 100k even though your portfolio hasn't changed at all"
2021-05-23 21:12:28,stocks,"True. Okay, I bought AMC when it was at about 2 and change a share. When it skyrocketed to 15, I sold them. Needless to say, come tax time I will owe money to the IRS. I also purchased TripAdvisor. It was in the red for me. I like the company and believe in them long term. I think the app is excellent. However, I sold it, took the loss to lessen the blow on the taxes a little bit and used the money to reinvest in another company. Later, I’ll be back and purchase TripAdvisor. I doubt it’ll be up much in a month. Meanwhile, the money I used to reinvest so far, and I mean so far, is up. I shaved a little off my taxes and placed the money somewhere else. Also, here’s the kicker, TripAdvisor could continue to slide. So I might as well cut my losses short and lower my taxes.

The most common saying is that you should never invest more than you are willing to lose.

That's fair but what I have to say is this, look at your portfolio and imagine 40 percent less money. Then think about what would happen if you lost your job as well.

Would you freak out and sell everything or hold it for 3 years while it gains and loses or does nothing and just trades sideways?

If you can hold your money to weather the storm, and the companies you invested in are solid with lot's of cash/liquid assets with low debt, you will be fine.

If you can't, maybe look up some hedging strategies and others for low risk investments to ride it out."

2021-05-24 04:38:57,stocks,"What you see is asset inflation plus economic growth. The US dollar, like any other fiat currency, looses value over time. This is by design. It's a debt based, inflationary system. 

Stocks have been a great way to preserve buying power over a longer time frame. Your expected return on investment does depend on your entry point. Right now, the average p/e ratio is high and you should expect a lower than average annual return.

You allocation in stocks should depend on your investment time horizon and your risk tolerance. Just imagine for a moment that the sp500 goes down another 50 percent. How will you react? Will you have to sell stocks at a loss to make ends meet or do you have a shopping list and cash at hand to buy more?

During a stock crash, almost everything gets sold off. Even gold and real estate will drop in value. Short term debt instruments and cash should be fine during a crash. But you have to take the opportunity cost and inflation into account because the market can keep going up while you wait on the sidelines."

2021-05-23 22:37:14,stocks,"Sure.  When you buy an option, you pay money and acquire a right (to buy or sell a particular security within a particular time period).  When you sell an option, you receive money and acquire an obligation (to buy or sell a particular security within a particular time period).

Here, if OP were to SELL a PUT option, he would get paid money (known as a premium).  In return, he would be obligated to buy whatever particular stock at a particular price within a particular time period.  

Let me give you an example.  I recently sold contracts in $STEM.  The ticker looks like this: -6 STEM 09/17/2021 30.00 P.  

This simply means that I received a premium.  In return, I took on the obligation to buy 600 shares of STEM at $30/share on or before Sept 17.

I have $18k frozen in my account as a result of this (hence, these are “cash-secured puts”).  If I didn’t have cash on hand, these would be “naked puts,” which I wouldn’t recommend. 

In sum, selling cash-secured puts can be a strategy to make money on your money while taking on an obligation to buy a stock that you wouldn’t mind buying."

2021-05-23 22:57:43,stocks,"Selling covered calls with 100 share you have implies that you are willing to give someone else the right to buy your shares at a specified target price to be “called away” via exercising the contract.

For example, you hold 100 shares of AAPL with an average cost of $125 right now. Having 100 shares allows you to write these contracts or obligations that you will sell your 100 shares at a higher price and be paid a premium to do so. Let’s say, selling to open a call contract for Apple: AAPL $140 C 6/18 for $0.23. You’ll be instantly credited $23 to your brokerage account.

Running a covered calls strategy is good for stocks that grow in price slowly and stocks that you don’t mind holding forever. AAPL is a great example since it is a dividend, growth stock with strong fundamentals. Ideally (and best case scenario), you don’t want to get your shares called away because you’d rather hold it for the long term and let those call contracts you sold to expire worthless and keep the contract premium.

Worst case scenario, you get assigned your bearish covered call play by being forced to sell your AAPL shares at $140 if the contract expires ITM or gets exercised early. Since you owned your 100 shares at a cost basis of $125 and got forced to sell the shares to the counter party at $140 (the agreed upon strike price of the contract you wrote), you essentially pocketed $1523 of profit. Basically, in a covered call strategy you are capping/limiting your earning upside in the underlying by selling a call option. If you think the stock ran up too much and implied volatility of the stock is high, you can sell a call option with a juicy premium to sell the AAPL shares at the price you want and get paid a premium in the process. Covered calls are good if you do it with a good stock that won’t swing too wildly, meme stocks for instance can quickly wreck your overall portfolio that is exposed to the underlying performance of the stock price. Also, covered calls will start losing you money in potential upside if the stock price moves above your break even price for the call contract ($140.23 in this example). So once AAPL hits above $140.23, that’s when you start missing out on further gains.

So, usually covered calls can be a great way to make some solid income on top of your favorite stocks and ETFs. I didn’t talk too much about the Greeks, this is useful to know if you plan to do a PMCC with a long ITM leap to sell covered calls against it. I wouldn’t recommend it for a beginner since PMCCs will swing harder if the stock trades sideways or downwards and it is also subject to theta decay (contracts lose time value and will eventually expire worthless)."

2021-05-23 20:25:16,stocks,"Volatility drag is way less scary when you look at it mathematically.  For leverage ratio L, by Ito's Lemma the expected CAGR is Lx - (L^2 - 1 ) / 2 * stddev^2 where x is the CAGR of the underlying and stddev is essentially the volatility.  So for TQQQ, your expected returns are essentially 3x the returns of QQQ, minus (3^2 - 1) / 2 * stddev^2 = 3 * QQQ - 4 * stddev^2.  The stddev of QQQ over its lifetime is 15.43% and its CAGR is 20.51%, so this formula says TQQQ should return 3 * .2051 - 4 * .1543^2 = 52.0%.  The actual return of TQQQ is 50.86%, so you can see this formula gets you pretty close[*].  The additional difference is due to the expense ratio and cost of the derivatives they use to implement the fund.

TWO BIG RISKS HERE.

1. In a period of low returns volatility drag does become significant.  Volatility drag scales proportionally to L^2 and volatility^2.  It's been 9.5% per year for TQQQ.  That's been no big deal the past decade, but only because QQQ has returned 20.5%.  Notice that the volatility drag formula does not depend at all on the return.  So if we have a decade where QQQ only returns 5% per year, with the same volatility we've had, TQQQ will only return 5.5% before fees and borrowing costs - so it'll likely do worse than the underlying.
2. A true bear market like 2000 or 2008 (before 3x funds existed) is the biggest risk in my opinion.  This can cause a huge drawdown that takes a decade or more to recover from because you start with such a low baseline.  If you are young, that's fine, in fact it's desirable because you can keep buying at the bottom.  But you'd want to start ramping down your leverage decades in advance of retirement or big purchases like a home downpayment.

Because of these two risks I strongly recommend only holding a fraction of your portfolio in 3x ETF(s).  You can still achieve handsome returns much more safely at something like 1.5x or 2x overall leverage.

>...completely ignoring that even Tesla admits their system is still level 2, and is explicitly not autonomous.

This is often misunderstood. If you dig into it more clearly, they were simply clarifying to regulators that, ""What we call 'Full Self Driving Beta' should be considered as level 2 for liability purposes"". The implied meaning being that, a level 3 or higher system will not be called ""Full Self Driving Beta"". Being the a beta release of the autonomous system, *it should definitely not be considered autonomous*. Level 3 is considered autonomous. Once it is out of beta then I would expect it to be level 3 at least, since level 3 is when it starts being considered autonomous.

The autonomy levels are really mostly for liability to determine when it starts to shift from the driver to the manufacturer, so it's very important to clarify exactly when it should be considered as level 3 or higher as that will result in an additional shift of the liability of accidents from the driver to Tesla. This can be looked at as ""Well, it's clearly flawed because they are avoiding getting it classified as level 3"" or ""They simply don't want to deal with the additional liabilities of level 3"", but realistically speaking there are really only two levels of autonomy. Either you need to be prepared to take over (level 4 or less) or you don't. With that in mind, it is best from a lawsuit/liability adverse perspective, to leave it as level 2 (car owner is responsible for accidents) until it's ready to be considered level 5 (manufacturer is responsible for accidents, but is much better than a human, so accidents are far less likely).

If you look at FSD beta from a technical perspective and review what is considered level 3, then it seems quite clear that FSD Beta is far more accurately classified as level 3 than level 2 in terms of capabilities (stopping at stoplights, making turns, being able to complete drives with little if any interventions), indeed, out of beta it might be closer to level 4 than 3. So why classify it as level 2? Liability as mentioned above, it's wise from a liability avoidance perspective to keep it classified as only level 2 for as long as the regulators will allow or until it's level 5. *In fact, it would not surprise me if FSD Beta being considered as level 2 instead of level 3 causes trouble for Tesla in the future, specifically for trying to avoid liabilities.* Autopilot is clearly at least a level 2 system, so what does that make FSD Beta which is clearly far more capable? It would seem quite clear that FSD Beta should probably be considered at least level 3.

[https://www.synopsys.com/automotive/autonomous-driving-levels.html](https://www.synopsys.com/automotive/autonomous-driving-levels.html)

I will agree that it's less clear how long it'll take for it to be out of beta, and it has taken a fair while longer than expected to get here. Elon is optimistic that it'll be months (before 2022), but Elon time and all so perhaps more like mid/late 2023. If it's going to be out of beta and thus autonomous, then that would imply a public beta probably within a few months or so."

2021-05-23 21:16:50,stocks,"It's a matter of perspective, are you not calling it autonomous because regulations say you can't or are you not calling it autonomous because you don't want the additional regulatory oversight that would result from calling it autonomous. I strongly believe it's the later, and I also believe it will probably bite them at some point in the future, quite possibly the California DMV investigation going on. That's going to end not great either way. It's going to either be considered that it should be level 3 and get slapped for specifying level 2, or it's going to be level 2 and get slapped for implying it was higher in advertising.

As for those 3 last words, they were not intended as there is no evidence that I could find that clearly shows that there was actually regulatory pushback against it being considered level 2. The DMV asked Tesla what they wanted it considered as, Tesla said level 2, and now the DMV has some raised eyebrows raised because the naming suggests it should be higher than that. My inclination is they were hedging and referring to it as a level lower than it actually is because beta is intended to be more of a level 2.5, though as I mentioned above, having done that will probably get them into trouble as well. Sigh, the USS TSLA sails some rather choppy seas, thankfully my trading strategy for TSLA makes more money the more volatile it is (TSLA certainly has it's ups and downs). So I'll be quite happy as long as it isn't below around 300-400 this time next year.

2021-05-24 10:56:34,stocks,Alot of the debt is due to the ford credit business but this debt is usually backed by finance receivables. Same goes for GM. Both companies have large debt loads but they both are due to the finance businesses both companies operate.
2021-05-23 22:39:34,stocks,why do that when you can just print money
2021-05-23 21:09:51,stocks,I thought Ford did too?
2021-05-23 21:59:13,stocks,"Ford’s a bit more complicated. They didn’t need bailout money but they did ask for loan funds because they didn’t want to have to compete with government-subsidized companies. GM and Chrysler would’ve gone bankrupt without the money. Ford wouldn’t have. It wasn’t even Ford, technically. It was Ford Credit, their loan arm and it wasn’t TARP funds."

2021-05-23 22:56:37,stocks,Could be it. Inflation is a couple of percent. But a retreat from the market is tens of percent discount on bottom-feeding.

But I agree this is a long-term hold of Chinese pressure subsides which it should."
2021-05-23 23:59:51,stocks,Don't you think the $2 billion fine has anything to do with that?
2021-05-24 02:15:04,stocks,No that was specifically for monopolizing their business.
2021-05-24 05:23:08,stocks,"Depends how much it fell? If he buys back in then his DCA might well be lower than people buying all the way down. You’re probably right in this case as it’s a volatile stock, and I’d probably buy on the way down myself, though I’m trying to stop doing that as catching a falling knife slightly wrong feels shitty."
2021-05-24 07:20:01,stocks,"Do you even realise how this Sounds like a Qanon Story? 
The Reptiloids will replace the management and only you will notice.

Go to China or talk at least to people there, the Country is bigger and more populated than most, getting more and more diverse, ethnical and richer...

So they put ethnical correct regulations in place as you demand to provide financial stability and it’s bad because it’s done by the wrong party? 
Can you even explain the happening regulation and fines? I don’t think so..."

You forget they silenced Jack Ma for speaking out? Also, ethical, not ethnical."
2021-05-24 13:44:13,stocks,They didn’t silence Alibaba was behaving Monopolist and Ant was providing bad credits...two things where China had less restrictions than other developped Economys.

Luckily most worked out since last April/May you could throw a dart and land on a double bagger. CRTO, TTD and APPS I had no clue about but motley fool recommended and those turned out fine. Other more recent picks did not lol (looking at you Pinterest and Etsy) It’s all a learning process and you’re gonna end up paying the market some tuition before you start seeing real compound growth.

2021-05-24 18:21:32,stocks,"Lol i was not commenting on anything other than your comment on valuations sir. Applying outdated valuation metrics which failes to account for intrinsic value is a poor valuation method to use in valuing tech sector companies. Is good for mature companies in mature industries such as oil and gas

2021-05-24 19:19:27,stocks,"It’s not even my evaluation. I mentioned the average range that experts get. Sure they can be off, but they’re not going to be 2.5x off. I trust Morningstar knows how to evaluate tech companies. They don’t get some pass on being new. Their value exists regardless of how much hope you have in them.

2021-05-23 23:11:13,stocks,"It lowers the stock price which makes it psychologically more attractive to smaller investors.

It also makes option prices smaller, which allows for more trading of options as well.

The six month is up huge in every major index. Most are even up for the month! Most accounts shouldn't be red."
2021-05-24 15:46:52,stocks,"Yeah. It's mostly just people who jumped into the market while it was roaring up with post covid interest rates. A bunch of people jumped into crypto when BTC 10xd too, and have just lost money since. I've lost track of how many people on social media I saw jumping into dogecoin at it's peak. Mostly people who don't understand investing.

The ARK ETFs in particular I've noticed are highly misunderstood. I tend to just ignore people entirely when they start complaining about them - go back and read about your investments before you put your money in them. They shouldn't be treated like an index fund where you just chuck money into them every paycheck - they're meant to play a small role in a balanced portfolio. 5-15% (depending on portfolio theme), rebalanced from time to time in order to gain an outsized return on growth markets OR to hedge for disrupted markets. You can literally read that on their [website](https://ark-funds.com/help-center/how-to-use-ark-etfs-in-a-portfolio) for ""how to use these funds in your portfolio."" They'll earn you a few percentage points during exceptional markets, while costing you a percentage point or two during other markets."
2021-05-24 03:19:55,stocks,"VTI is total market which I prefer. VOO is the S&P500. VTI is 70% VOO so there's significant overlap, however you'll get more exposure to small and mid cap. Over the last 20 years total market has outperformed the S&P500 by about 40%. 

That said, S&P500 will be slightly less volatile given exposure to the top 500 by market cap size. Either way can't go wrong with one or the other.

EDIT: did you mean VOO or VT? Because VT is total world exposure so that'll include international. I personally use VTI but you can definitely go with VT for global exposure, roughly 55% US / 45% international."

2021-05-24 16:05:44,stocks,"Check out mining stocks. You can usually get market correlated returns with greater than market returns from a handful of well picked miners. There are a couple good websites out there with DD on them.

If you just want exposure to the silver market, I would recommend $PSLV over $SLV. $PSLV holds actual physical silver instead of paper silver, so you contribute to the squeeze more by holding it and their return is about the same. The Elliot waves predict a price run up in silver this fall, but who knows really?

Or... if you're extra dumb like me, hold leveraged silver ticker $AGQ. I actually have a leveraged strategy that is hella hedged, so I probably wouldn't recommend doing what I'm doing just starting out."

2021-05-24 15:49:22,stocks,The significance of the amount of the company is its value. The only reason a split surges the value is because enough people assume it will on no basis. If you’re small enough to not be buying a full share at a time then you’re too small to make any impact on a company of scale.

2021-05-24 04:32:43,stocks,"P/e ratios are just one small data point in a much larger story, and you should look at them as such.  They can be useful when comparing trends over time in the same company or when comparing companies in the same industry, but they arent a marker of a good or bad company by themselves.

In general, a lower p/e is better than a high one but you must understand the context of the company and industry before it actually means anything.

Lots of bad investments have low p/e ratios.  Lots of good investments have high p/e ratios."

Corrections are not a matter of if they will happen but when they will happen. I would just recommend you figure out a reasonable valuation/price for a company's stock that you like and buy at dip prices you like.

This is a good solution nonetheless. This will be great for last mile delivery except for three problems. First its limited payload, two it requires the receiver to be there when the thing arrives and last, there will be a lot of areas it cannot reach. Still this can be very handy for food delivery but... wow they will need a lot of these to be efficient and then you have a problem of them slowing traffic and causing road rage... you have to deal with trolls and vandals...

When Jack Ma started to look that way, they took him out by holding up Ant's IPO and going after BABA for anti-competitive practices. JD is under the microscope now as well because the gov't fears what it cannot control. So when companies get too big, there is a growing concern of additional regulation or the gov't breaking it up into pieces. Fear has yet to subside over this which is why JD and BABA are both trading a very low P/Es. I'm betting it's more bark than bite and this is a short term correction. Like Trump, the key is to kiss the ring and only say positive things about the government and you get your milk and cookies."
2021-05-24 01:25:01,stocks,"I am a big fan of GE with their CEO. Honestly though, he's probably the reason the stock is trading at a relative premium. People sometimes forget that GE does have a little foothold in the wind turbine game and Larry Culp plans on taking advantage of that market. I would not be surprised if they announced some more projects in the next couple years. They usually fly under the radar but can definitely make a difference for investor sentiment because a lot of people still hate GE for how it collapsed a couple years ago, it ruined retirement funds, pensions, you name it. People still probably have a bad tatse in their mouths that only good execution on their turnaround can heal. 

I've mainly played GE since may last year, I bought leaps and calls but no shares until a couple months ago, the market last year was easier to make money on options, so I figured the smart move once January hit would be to cash out and use some profits to buy shares. Im happy I own them, it's probably doomed to trade sideways for a while but once air travel resumes, their GECAS deal will prove to have been a great move. 

It's a long hold and nothing that will break the bank, but in my view, GE is going to double in the next few years. I have an exit price for half of my position but the other half I plan on holding until I see something that gives me a good reason to sell, fundamentals, yada yada. 

I am also a little biased because GE was one of my biggest cash cows last year and thinking that the next couple years will be the same can be a bit shortsighted of me, but I am convicted and will stick to my bet right now as I see it as a safe, slow return on profits I have already secured."

I doubt Burry bought these stupid weeklies, unless he wanted to stir the pot using his 13F, but without knowing the stike and put, this news means fuck all. Media is making it seem like it's a huge deal. Sad thing is, lots of people will ""believe"" this and panic"

That being said, I think we are at least a decade away from true level 5 self driving, if not more. Most likely several companies will get there at the same time. In time the whole scientific community will end up solving the problem in a very similar way.

Regarding current TSLA ""market domination"", you are probably looking at US data, which is only a part of world demand. In Europe Tesla in nowhere to be found in the top 10 EV car models. Overall its market share is less then 17% of the EV market, followed closely by everybody else, and in decline during the last Q."
