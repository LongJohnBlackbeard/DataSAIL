2021-06-05 19:59:59,stocks,I’ve thought about this also. It is definitely a possibility; this is why I’m long term bullish on the S&P 500.
2021-06-05 19:52:43,stocks,"It gives you the right, but not obligation to buy shares at a discounted price. This price should be noted, and you're given a set time between which you can exercise this right. Until the date at which these shares can be purchased, you can trade the rights on the market in the same way you'd trade stocks. This is usually done to raise funds, a bit like a second offering."
2021-06-05 19:56:56,stocks,"Yes, mathematically a stock that drops 75% will influence less total dollars than the same stock going +400%.  A market cap of $1b would require an additional $3b to run up 400%, but would only lose $750m to drop by 75%, so it’s safe to say it requires about 3x more money to make them move up than it does to go down.

Whether or not this is more efficient or not really depends on total shares and how many sellers or buyers there are.   

Many people just buy and hold, so if you’re the ONLY shareholder who wants to sell and everybody else is holding, then it takes only a single share to move the ticker +400% or -75%.   In this case you’d still touch more dollars to go +400%.

This is why volume is such an important thing to watch on a stock.   If the stock has 1b shares outstanding and a daily trade volume of 100k shares then that’s quite low, and price action would be easily influenced by a relatively small number of traders.   If a big whale comes in and tries to sell 1m shares at market the price would tank because nobody is buying that much, even if the majority of the shareholders value the stock much higher.

If you’ve got a high volume trading hands and a strong move up or down, it’s usually safe to believe the company is being valued differently.   Low volume price moves don’t tend to mean as much, and often bounce back.   This is very common and easily found in pre-market trading, where a stock may move around on low volume but will snap back at market open."
2021-06-05 19:39:19,stocks,"Uhhh, it's percentage math, that's it.

Would it still blow your mind if I said it's losing $3 in stock price vs gaining $3 in stock price?

Realistically, a stock can gain $3 in a second, and drop back $3 the next second. It only depends on supply and demand."
2021-06-05 19:43:09,stocks,"For companies with sound fundamentals, once the share price drops below some critical price, investors will buy shares as a *value* investment. This will increase the demand for shares, preventing the price from dropping further before rebounding."
2021-06-05 19:27:37,stocks,"Dude, lay off the weed /s.

But seriously, the concept you’re looking for is not the stock price but market capitalisation.

Market cap. = stock price x number of shares on issue (roughly).

Prices will move around more for low market cap companies. There’s also the issue of minimum “tick”. Depending on the company and exchange, people might only be able to bid/ask in 0.05, 0.01 or 0.001 increments."
2021-06-05 19:55:10,stocks,Some logic there.... That's why the majority of $ made in options is in puts not calls.
2021-06-05 19:42:45,stocks,Yeah. I guess this question is nonsense. But it does seem like if I am looking at a stocks -% it should be less serious than if looking at a stocks similar +%. Like a stock dropping  50% means less than a stock gaining 50%? I'm just confusing myself. Ill shuddup now.
2021-06-05 19:39:00,stocks,"well in a super simplified example: lets say a company has 10 shares available, trading at 4 dollars each. Cap is 40. If said stock dropped by 75% value, price is 1 dollar and cap is 10, so cap also drops 75%. Likewise raising the price back to 4 dollars requires 400% price growth, also raising the cap from 10 to 40 with 400% cap growth. I don't see how market cap is the answer to my question?

EDIT: oops messed up a value."
2021-06-05 19:54:50,stocks,"Well percentage gives you a good idea how much money you gained or lost that day owning that stock. But like I said, it's the same ""energy"" to move in either direction for the same stock.

However, if you're looking at two different stocks, then you can't really compare them unless they have the same number of shares. A company with less shares will move in price more easily, simply because there is less supply."
2021-06-05 19:53:46,stocks,"It only “seems” harder if you’re looking at it solely on a percentage basis. It requires a $3 move upwards to go back up to $4. Likewise, a $3 drop on $4 leads to a $1 stock."
2021-06-05 19:56:29,stocks,"True. I guess I should start psychologically looking at -% as less meaningful as +% though.

Like seeing a ticker at -10% means less than seeing a ticker at +10%, although psychologically, at first glance, they seem equal."
2021-06-05 19:17:33,stocks,Any big surprises here?
2021-06-05 17:15:06,stocks,Currently the meme stock mania is scattered across pretty much all investing subreddits. You just gotta filter that out and focus on your goals and try to find useful stuff that suite you.

Shutting down stores due to fierce competition is bearish by definition.



However the stock price don't care, because it's *the meme stock* with a cult following like Tesla. It's a part of peoples identity. It's by definition the anarchist leftwing wet dream of *regular people sticking it to the establishment* aka the hedge funds.

2021-06-05 15:34:44,stocks,"Most of the times they can locate the shares in their own inventory and this is what most likely happens in the case you just described.  If one of the other customers at the same brokerage already has the shares they can automatically borrow from one account to another.  If they don't have it in their own inventory you would usually get an error saying there are no shares to borrow and then you would have to call someone to place the trade and they will have to locate the shares from another broker.  No they are not going to do that for your 10 shares but they will for a big account that is looking for a bigger share count.

2021-06-05 15:50:57,stocks,"I don’t understand what that term “naked shorting” is supposed to mean. If you sold a share to someone you need to have a share in your hand even if it’s not yours, otherwise you are not selling a share. 

That’s pretty “naked” in my book, but until now I had not realized that some seem to think that it means that someone is making shares up out of thin air."
2021-06-05 15:57:24,stocks,Naked shorting is a very specific definition of illegal activity.  Naked shorting is selling shares that you do not own and have not borrowed.  It is illegal and many people on here think it is rampant and the reason their favorite meme stocks are not on Mars yet.  The normal process of shorting a stock requires you to locate and borrow shares from another share holder and then sell the shares you borrowed.  When you close your short position you return the shares to the person you borrowed them from.  The person who borrows the shares usually pays a fee for the privilege of borrowing the shares.  For most retail customers that fee goes to the brokerage and the brokerage lends out your shares without your knowledge.  They are allowed to do this if you have a margin account as it is part of the margin agreement and most people have margin even if they don't know it.  A margin account is not the same as a margin loan if that is your next question.  This is part of the reason (along with pay for order flow) that brokers can offer commission free trading.  They have to making it from somewhere.  If you do not wish to have your shares loaned out to short sellers you have to have a cash account or give explicit instructions to the broker that you do not want your shares leant out (I am not even sure if you can do that with popular free brokers).
2021-06-05 16:19:52,stocks,"Naked short selling exploits the time delay between trading and settlement. Settlement happens at T+2 - so you have 2 days after selling the shares to physically deliver the shares. As such, you can enter into the trade to sell the shares, then arrange to borrow/buy the shares later. However, if you can’t deliver at T+2, you’re in trouble."

I don't see ARKX doing anything amazing for the next couple years, but when the space industry takes off and it's the new gold rush I could see her style of investing leading to record breaking profits. This is all assuming the space industry takes off and becomes the most profitable thing in the world. I mean imagine how much money at some point we could make getting rare minerals or a million other insane ideas that will come to play. 

 At some point space will be the next big investment. Who know's maybe we catch one of those UFO ships CNN and the Navy posted videos of, reverse engineer their technology and a whole new world of technology opens up for us.

No use grumbling about current performance when these ETFs are designed to be ahead of the curve. Is space exploration relevant now? No. Just like her innovation, and next gen internet fund, you have to give it time for the industry to ramp up."
2021-06-05 17:06:38,stocks,"I'm continuing to hold some shares of ARKK. I think she gets a worse rep than she deserves and more flack for the underperforming. When you buy an ETF with the stated strategy X and then X doesn't perform well the ETF isn't going to perform well. Just because it's actively traded doesn't mean that it's a mutual fund. Holding an ETF that underperforms the market is unpleasant, holding an ETF that is no longer giving exposure to the equities it's supposed to is unacceptable and I suspect would be illegal. 

So regardless of what you think of her stock picking I think a lot of the criticism is kind of unfair. She made changes at the margins to add ""cash-like"" stocks that made the ETFs more stable liquid in preparation for a correction in the market, which is a marginal change but it's about all she can do while still keeping true to what the ETF does. 

In Irrational Exuberance there's a little chunk where the author writes about how some of the really good money managers were outperforming the market prior to the dotcom bubble and then crashed harder than others. The trend was that a bunch of the managers continued to outperform the market after the dotcom bubble, and long-term did fine, but their funds had huge inflows in the years following a hot streak and big outflows following the correction. So the managers can regularly beat the market, but the average investors can still under-perform by not being patient."

2021-06-05 16:36:07,stocks,Lets just say all of my ark investments have TANKED these past few months. I unloaded most of them at a loss because I have little faith they’re coming back any time soon.
2021-06-05 19:37:34,stocks,ARK series are pump and dumps

2021-06-05 15:09:01,stocks,"How well has disruptive growth been performing since the top in february? The answer is generally worst than the ARK funds.


SPCE 55$ -> 31$



PLTR 38$ -> 24$


WKHS 40$ -> 13$


The list goes on.


Once speculative growth does good again, i have no doubt ARK will be doing well again."

2021-06-05 19:20:59,stocks,"She'll probably be in the green again soon enough but over time she'll underperform. She always do, like most others. Look at her previous ETFs and their performance, it's well known she likes to start high risk/disruptive ETFs and usually get a decent honeymoon period. Eventually she'll fail, get desperate and double down on bad beds sending her further into red.



Once this happens she'll quit and start a new ""disruptive ETF"" and promise the world once again. She's done it many, many times...usually all it takes is a few red/underperforming months and she'll bail. Taking her sweet sweet cash and leaving everyone else holding the bags. But don't trust me, look up her ""work history"" and realize it's a repeating pattern. Once she hits a red streak she's eyeing the exit while telling everyone else to hold"
2021-06-05 19:45:52,stocks,"Tech is tired out.  ARK is tech.  Cathy is ARK.  Therefore, Cathy is tired out.  

The profits were taken.  The sector was rotated out, so it will be in malaise for awhile.  I made a little here and there since February, but from the volumes and flat prices - it's apparent this is a sector in paralysis."

Step 2: for money you've decided to risk, 20% max position would be aggressive, conservative would be like 20-30 positions in fairly diversified stocks. Sweet spot is probably 8-10 positions that you're more confident in or have researched well. But if you aren't diversified across sectors, 8 vs 1 position may barely matter."
2021-06-05 16:35:21,stocks,"“You don’t have to be an expert on every company, or even many,” he says. “You only have to be able to evaluate companies within your circle of competence. The size of that circle is not very important; knowing its boundaries, however, is vital.”

A nice quote from Warren Buffett on diversification."
2021-06-05 19:34:59,stocks,"1) Mathematically, the amount of money you are investing has no meaning for the benefits of diversification, so you should try to meet optimal diversification regardless of whether you are investing $1,000 or $1,000,000.

Being able to buy fractional shares now helps makes this more possible.

2) Here's a good video to watch.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGXu5S6W7uk&ab\_channel=InvestorsJournal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGXu5S6W7uk&ab_channel=InvestorsJournal)

In essence, 10-20 stocks with low correlation to each other.

3) Only invest in stocks that you can really follow and know well. If you only have time to follow and research 2 stocks, then it is better to invest in those two stocks instead of 18 more stocks that you don't really have time to understand and follow.

I generally only have time to research and follow 5 stocks, so I generally only invest in 5 at a time even though this is less than optimal in the diversification sense."
2021-06-05 18:38:55,stocks,I think its more about how many companies you can understand and follow throughtout the year.  Diversification is more valuable when you have more to lose.  Start with 3 or 4 that you know.
2021-06-05 14:31:35,stocks,"If you’re holding long term, consider an ETF. If you want to manage it, try to limit to only a handful of stocks. I try to hold no more than 10-12 positions, and I hold an average of 3-6 months. (Less if it moves against me, I want to ride the trend til it ends)"
2021-06-05 14:33:28,stocks,"If you know what your doing and you have 5 years experience and you now have $1000 buy 1 stock or 2 stocks if you have $10,000 buy 3 stocks to 10 stocks 
If you have $1,000,000 buy 5 to 15 stocks and always hold 10% to 30% in cash to buy more if you're stocks if the market tanks.

If you are new to stocks buy etfs with the $1000 split as follows  $400 total market big caps $200 small caps $200 emerging markets and hold $200 cash"

2021-06-05 14:31:54,stocks,"Better example: You buy 2 shares at $50 each. You sell 1 for $100. You will be taxed on the $50 gain from that share.

Also, in the US, if you held that share less than 1 year it will be taxed as income. More than 1 year then capital gains."
2021-06-05 14:27:11,stocks,"Only what you sell is taxed, all other gains or loses are unrealized."
2021-06-05 14:30:53,stocks,"Put simply, you don’t get to withdraw your initial total cost basis for free. That is what you are proposing; when you talk about spending $100 on the stock, and then selling only $100 worth of it regardless of how it has grown in value since you purchased it.

You are taxed on capital gains. Capital gains are calculated by comparing the price each share is worth when sold versus the price each share was worth when purchased. The difference between the two is your gain (or loss).

If you buy two shares at $100 each for a total cost of $200, your cost basis *per share* is $100. If they go up in value to $200 per share and you sell one of your shares, you get $200 in proceeds. However, your initial cost basis *per share* was $100. You now have $100 in capital gains, and that’s what you’ll be taxed on."
2021-06-05 13:35:42,stocks,"Your second situation, you get taxed not on what you paid to buy the share but the profit you made once you sold it

So if you bought 1 share at the price of 50, and then sold it at 100, you get taxed on the 50 profit you made"
2021-06-05 13:36:54,stocks,"You're right.  Your friend is wrong.

You pay tax on the gain (sale price - cost) of what you sold.  You sold .5 shares so you figure your cost of that .5 share ($50 in this case) and deduct it from the sales price, and pay tax on that amount.

Assuming US.  I don't know the tax laws of other countries."
2021-06-05 18:31:09,stocks,Thank you!
2021-06-05 18:30:36,stocks,"Got it, thank you! I was trying to explain that to my friend but he kept saying ""if you spend $100 and then sell $100 then no matter the context you don't pay any taxes"""
2021-06-05 13:50:13,stocks,"Right but I believe he is asking about the fact he put $100 in and then sold $100 of what he owns.  So even thought the stock technically doubled, he is taking out the same as he put in.  Personally, I believe you would need to pay cap gains on the $50 profit you made since you were able to take out $50 more than you would of.  However I’m not a financial advisor and not financial advice"
2021-06-05 19:57:51,stocks,"Maybe they're looking at this from an entire portfolio perspective?

Example, say you spend $10,000 on your portfolio. At the end of the year, after buying and selling, you've realized $0 in gains. So in effect, $10,000 spent to make $0--or be left with $10,000. In that case there's no tax liability.

EDIT: they may also not understand the difference between ""realized"" and ""unrealized""."
2021-06-05 13:41:33,stocks,Coin base’s revenue derives mainly from trading fees. IMO they’ll eventually have to lower those fees to stay competitive

2021-06-05 13:28:32,stocks,They just took advantage of speculative investors by opening to public.
2021-06-05 16:41:39,stocks,"I am bullish on COIN! Coinbase is one of the top 5 most profitable exchanges in the world. Coinbase might make more money than Nasdaq. Coinbase is going to be huge because this is the first time we are able to directly play crypto in the equity market. Why I like COIN is that it is a play on Bitcoin AND all the other coins out there...whereas bitcoin is just a play on bitcoin, so you are getting all the other coins for free. COIN is heavily (96%) tied to the price of bitcoin, which is very hard to predict. Another advantage of COIN being the first crypto exchange coming onto the market first is that they potentially can use their stock as currency to buy any other competitors. And you don't have to believe in the crypto party line and the dangers of fiat currency and how you need an alternative, because central banks all over the world are printing money like crazy - even if you think this is nonsense, we know that there is a market for this kind of nonsense because gold bugs have been saying the same thing for decades. In other words, crypto has a natural constituency. Like gold, people buy it as a kind of inflation insurance and gold's strength is its scarcity - its supply only increases about 1% per year and it is getting harder and harder to find more - that sounds a lot like Bitcoin to me and I think it is totally legitimate to believe that crypto, in general, can rival gold as a storehold of value and COIN is the biggest brand and easiest on off ramp to do that."
2021-06-05 13:34:25,stocks,Do they really have a moat??
2021-06-05 16:28:20,stocks,Fees are too high. Other than that it's good for keeping an eye on the markets.

Since you say you are new I will give a bit of advice...the more speculative a stock is, the more you go from investing to gambling...(speculation is what a stock “might” do but doesn’t really have a history to back up this)

Invest smart, speculation should only be a very small part of the consideration when buying stocks..if the stock requires a lot of assumptions for its future just walk away."

These companies are capitalizing and taking advantage of the crypto craze. The only people who have benefited from CoinBase are the original stockholders.

2021-06-05 19:55:40,stocks,Been using CB CBP and Binance (.us) for about a month now. Fees are CRAZY high in CB and 7x higher in CBP (1% -maker taker combined) than Binance (0.15% maker taker combined). UX in all three is piss poor but CB is the cleanest. I should mention that CBP fees are tiered based on trading volume and get lower with increased volume. Laughably your volume has to be in excess of $100 MILLION before you pay the same low rates as somebody that just signed up for Binance with 100 bucks cash in their acct. LOL. ...lolololol. Charts in CB are really good looking but awfully misleading... great to trick any noob.  I think the aesthetics combined with big ad budget will bode well for $COIN. I have 10 shares of coin but am not won over by the product. I think their fee structure may ultimately engender a sentiment many retail investors feel toward Robbinghood. Feels like you're getting taken MAJOR advantage of. Not planning to hold $COIN very long. I doubt a tax plan for crypto will thwart the masses from getting in on some potentially easy money when setting up a bot and doing nothing can create a small revenue stream for literally anyone with minimal investment.
2021-06-05 16:47:53,stocks,Competitive to who?

As a company they can promise 6% APY ""risk free"" staking while pooling their clients money into a huge pot to generate a TON of revenue in mining profits... But everything seems to be changing so fast as crypto takes off.  This revenue stream could fall off just as quickly as fees presumably will."
2021-06-05 15:13:47,stocks,Absolutely agree that they need to diversify their revenue away from trading fees.  I've no doubt there are potential opportunities for them like custody/staking etc but I'm not a buyer of COIN until we get clarity on what those look like.
2021-06-05 15:49:48,stocks,Coinbase working on other revenue ways like bank cards adding new crypto faster and many other plans also they don.t have revenue costs .It's great company for long term . Also commission fees in EU gone stay for very long time no point to cut it if it's no cheaper or free competitors . For example Revolut charges insane fees to buy crypto 2.5% and 2.5% to sell and people anyway uses it .

When companies go public part of the reason is to raise money, meaning, they obtain money from the public far and above what they were able to obtain privately because they are offering their company on a public stock exchange. All that money that investors give them when they buy their stock they will turn around and make an offer to a competitor like Kraken, etc, ""hey, we will give you 1.3 shares of COIN for each share of your privately held company if you agree to merge with us.""  This is money that COIN now enjoys due to coming public first and didn't have while private, and essentially is a big advantage in the competitive landscape of the crypto space."

2021-06-05 16:11:04,stocks,"I firmly believe the fees will be there for an extended period of time. I view crypto trading more like currency trading than stock trading. Fees will always be a part of currency trading. With stock trading, fees have become obsolete due to payment for order flow. That’s not possible with crypto since it’s decentralized. Imo COIN has a huge advantage as the first big player in this space and I believe this could be one of the most valuable stocks in the next decade. I’m very long term bullish."

But what i think is that their current business model will survive at least the next 3-5 years. Around the 3 year mark we will likely be able to evaluate the impact of other companies emulating coinbase or coming up with their own models.

Similar to EVs. Every car company is going to take a piece of the pie away from companies like NIO and TSLA. We just dont know which companies are going to become the best competitors yet. 

I think this stock is speculative, and would look to average in over the course of the next year. I think it could easily drop to 200 over the next year or increase."
2021-06-05 14:32:56,stocks,"I think (and I know very little) that it'll probably go the same for crypto as for electric vehicles.  The oil industry isn't just going to go away.  It'll fade out over time, but these energy companies have enough resources to find a way to migrate.  They may become smaller but I doubt they'll collapse.  I think banks are the same.  Crypto is hyped up and I'm finally at a place where the attention and adoption makes me comfortable enough to invest.  But, I think it will be a long time before people take it seriously enough for banks to start feeling the burn...

I guess my big question is: will Coinbase be Google in ten years, or will their revenue drop out / will they get out-competed?  Seems like the latter and everyone here seems to agree on that."

2021-06-05 17:12:50,stocks,"?  That’s strange logic.  By that same logic there was no benefit from lots of people using google for search its early days.

Of course there’s benefits to scale because new features will be developed for it at a faster rate than competitors.  We are only scratching the surface on the features that these Crypto back ends will bring.  There’s going to be tons of innovation in DeFi that coinbase will have the pole position on.  Staking, synthetic assets, peer to peer loans....Coinbase will have the eyeballs and liquidity to benefit from these innovations.  They only need to scrape tiny amounts of money off these transactions to be a cash generating machine."
2021-06-05 16:12:05,stocks,"Just based on what I’ve read in this thread, I came to the opposite conclusion when we start talking long term. The numbers won’t be as impressive once the long expected bear market kicks in, and once centralized banks like JPM offer their own commission free crypto trading, then that’ll be the deathknell of Coinbase’s competitiveness AND profit. 

I wish you luck."
2021-06-05 14:50:06,stocks,"I think for crypto to succeed, it needs to consolidate into a couple of coins and for the price to stabilise. How can any business reasonably use it otherwise ? Sure, Tesla used it for a (in my opinion) short term publicity stunt but.. These 2 factors are both bad news if you’re profit is in trading currencies.

I rate coinbase value the same as any other casino. The only difference being, they have a finite lifespan as the source of their gaming goes one of 2 ways - crypto failure or evolution into mainstream finance. The later could see a buyout opportunity by a mainstream banking player, for account acquisition, but I am steering well clear. Short-term play in coin volatility, but got to be careful not to be left holding the bag."

2021-06-05 00:00:00,stocks,"Question about selling calls, where does the obligation of providing the shares go? I apologize if this is a common/repeated question, but I haven’t been able to get a solid answer. 

As I understand, trading options can be very risky, so I am a ways off before I’m comfortable doing so. I’m really just trying to understand how they work right now. 

 I’ve heard about selling your call options but I’m not sure how it works. Let’s say I bought a call through my broker (I’m using Robinhood, might change soon). I know I have the right but not obligation to buy 100 shares at the strike price at/before my expiration. Who is the entity that has the obligation of providing those shares? Is it Robinhood, or just who ever wants to take the risk of selling shares at a loss? For the next part of the question I will refer to this original seller as person A. 
Now, let’s say my call goes in the money. But I don’t want to buy thousands of dollars worth of shares. The only reason I’d be in this situation is that I’ve heard I can sell calls, so lets say I sell it to person B (person, entity, whatever). But as it is I don’t have 100 shares in my possession. Am I now obligated to sell person B 100 shares if they decide to exercise the call, or is person A (who sold me the contract originally) still obligated? 

I’ve been researching but haven’t got a straight answer. From what I’ve read, this would be considered selling a naked call, but I am not sure if that is accurate because I understood naked calls as I am person A in my example, but I don’t have 100 shares at the time of selling the option. I’ve also heard of selling to close, which I think is the situation I’m describing but I’m also not sure exactly what happens to the option and how money is earned from that. So can anyone explain if I can sell call contracts, and how that works. Also anywhere I can read more about this type of situation would be good too."

2021-06-05 11:40:55,stocks,"When you ""sell to open"", you open your position on the option. If it's a call, you sell the right, to someone else, to buy shares from you at a given price (strike price), in exchange for a premium (price of the option). In this case, it's you who has the obligation to sell the shares. If you already own the shares, it's called a covered call, otherwise, naked. If you sell a put, you sell the right to sell shares to you. If you have the cash available in your account, it's called a cash-secured put. So who has the obligation to buy/sell shares? Whoever sells the contract.

If before expiry, the option is in the money and you don't want to be assigned (actually buy or sell the shares), you may ""buy to close"" the same option. This will close your position and terminate your obligation.

Now an example. Let's say you're bullish on a stock and sell 1 put contract (100 shares) for $1/share at a strike price of $10. You collect that premium ($100). You're bullish and you expect the stock to go up, so the price of your put to go down. The day before expiry, you were wrong and the underlying stock went down and sits at $9, so you're likely to get assigned. The price of your put is now $1.50. You have a choice: either you choose to get assigned and buy those 100 shares at $10 each while its price is currently $9, or you close your position before expiry and buy the same put at $1.50 for a loss."
2021-06-05 11:30:49,stocks,"If you sell to open a call you have the obligation to provide the shares at the strike price if the person executes the option.

Person A sells 1 call they have to have an obligation to provide 100 shares at the strike price. Person B bought those calls and the price when up and they want to get out of the position without exercising the option.  When they sell the calls they bought to Person C they are transferring the right to exercise Person A's option to Person C.  Person B  now keeps whatever profits they make and Person C can choose whether or not to exercise their option on Person A's shares.

When you sell options your broker will let you either sell to open or sell to close.  If you sell to open you are establishing the obligation that you will provide shares if they are exercised.  When you sell to close you are exiting your position and transferring you option rights to the person you sold them to.

Note whether or not you are allowed to sell to open is based on option restrictions and your broker may not let you do this or may restrict you to covered calls only which means you must already have the 100 shares of the underlying stock in your account and are restricted from selling them until you close your call option (by buying to close your option)."
2021-06-05 11:32:50,stocks,"In general someone who owns 100 shares and puts them up as collateral is the person you bought your call from, and your broker just arranges for the two of you to have an exchange - they may or may not also be a player, but regardless it's not something I'd worry about/get into, just assumed you'd get the shares if you wanted to exercise - if you don't want to exercise then you can sell the call for whatever it's value is, which nearing expiry will be close to the difference between the strike price and the underlying * 100 - if you don't have the $ or margin to exercise this is probably what you should do, on margin your broker may exercise an ITM option and then sell the shares to get you $, but it's better if you handle it yourself instead generally"
2021-06-05 12:18:06,stocks,">I’ve been researching but haven’t got a straight answer. 

considering this is a very basic question, I somehow doubt this. Think of your call as an apple. You have 0 apples. You buy an apple. Over time, your apple has appreciated. You then sell your apple for profit. You now are once again in your original position of 0 apples.

If you buy a call, you have a contract. You then sell your contract. That's it. You have no more obligations. Now, if you have -1 contracts, that's when you have to worry about having 100 shares. In addition, most brokers won't allow you to sell naked calls without higher level options trading, meaning you'll need to pass an exam to show you know what you're doing."
2021-06-05 16:16:49,stocks,"Not to be rude but if you're having this much trouble understanding options, probably don't trade them. I really don't mean that in a bad way."
2021-06-05 18:13:33,stocks,"I had this same question recently because I'm also new to options. There is a difference between writing a call and buying a call. When you buy calls, you're buying from someone who wrote that call. When you sell that call option, you're still selling the option that was written by the person you bought from. The person who wrote the option, and decided on the time expiry and strike price, is responsible for providing the shares."

Definitely do"
2021-06-05 12:42:52,stocks,">Who is the entity that has the obligation of providing those shares?

The person who sold the call to open the trade. 

If you wrote a call, and your short call got exercised, you would be on the hook to deliver those 100 shares.

If your long call option went ITM, you could choose to exercise it and take delivery of those 100 shares, or sell your long call back to the market for someone else to buy."
2021-06-05 19:10:30,stocks,"Generally,  You want to sell calls at price you are willing to sell your shares.  Its not complicated."
2021-06-05 12:01:39,stocks,"Yes if I establish the call to sell, I know I have the obligation. The problem is every time I google something about selling a call, it tells me from the prespective of person A from our scenarios. I can’t find much from person B’s perspective on selling a call they bought. 

So in your situation, person A is still obligated to provide the 100 shares to person C, that obligation never gets transferred to person B correct? At least on a sell to close. That’s what I thought was happening but I want to be 1000000% sure before I even consider getting into those trades. I don’t want to end up obligated to purchase 1000’s of dollars worth of shares to sell at a loss. 

Also how does person B profit? What does person C pay? I’m going to use unrealistic numbers for easy math, but say stock is 5$ when I buy the call, strike is 10$, and I sell my call at 20$ to person C. How much does person C pay me, and if they exercise do they buy shares at 10$? Or is that not determinable because the the price of a call that is sell to close is fluid like shares themselves?"
2021-06-05 12:15:53,stocks,The price of the option is fluid like shares but it is generally based on math and implied volatility.  Lets say in your example that your stock is actually trading at the strike price of $10.  Depending on how much more time there is left on the option and how volatile the stock is there will be an implied premium lets just make up a number and say it is $2.00.  That means for the $10 stock with a $10 strike you could still buy/sell that option for $2.00.  Now if that stock immediately goes up to $13 it would likely keep the $2 premium but would be worth $5 since there is $3 of guaranteed value of being able to buy a $13 stock for just $10 and the volatility and time left stayed the same.  You would get that $3 profit on that $2 investment if you sold your option.  Now as time passes and the option expiration date gets closer that premium of $2 is going to disappear because the closer to expiration the less likely it is going to go up another $2 which is the break even price.  This reduction in the premium is called theta decay or time decay.  This was an over simplified example but the idea of buying and then selling calls is that the stock goes up faster than the theta decay you will make money buy selling the call you bought.    On the opposite side the person who sold the original call is betting that the option won't go up at all and at the end the theta decay will make the option only worth the difference in strike price and the current price which they hope will be less than the $2 they sold the option for and could be zero and they get to keep the whole $2 premium that you paid them.
2021-06-05 12:28:10,stocks,"So the actual net profits of selling are not directly (only indirectly) related to the price of the stock? By that I mean, in your example the 3 dollars profit is only 3 dollars, not 300$ due to the 100 shares? I know this example has simplified numbers, but more of a net profit would be made exercising the call then selling in your situation correct? And I have heard of the time decay, and I’m kind of understanding it, but that will take some more reading."
2021-06-05 12:33:19,stocks,It would be $3 per share so if you had 1 contract it would be $300 profit on a $200 investment.

If the shares are on deposit, then call that securities custodian on your paperwork.  They can sell the shares for you, if that is what you want.

If you have a stock certificate, then that is relatively easy to deal with, even if you don't currently have a broker.  Most big banks (Chase, Bank of America, etc) also have brokerage services.  I assume you have a checking account somewhere, so call your bank's 800 number and tell them your situation.  Their brokerage services can sort it out for you at no or low cost.

2021-06-05 00:00:00,stocks,"The Misdeeds of Culper & Hindenburg Research Hindenburg & Culper Research: A Danger To Free Markets

Disclosure: 

I am writing this article to expose the dangers that malicious short selling research companies pose to markets, and why it is essential for regulators to address the issues surrounding the unlawful tactics that short sellers may employ in order to drastically reduce the share price of publicly traded
companies.  I am writing this article using the example of On trak Behavioural Health Services (""The Company"" hereafter), a publicly traded company.  I have owned shares of this company in the past, and may purchase shares of this company in the future.  I will also include a few examples of other companies in this due diligence, and everything written
herein is merely my opinion.  I am not a financial advisor.  Please do your own research.  This article is for entertainment purposes only. Let's get to it.

What happened and why am I writing this?:

The Company provides online mental health and behavioural health services for people suffering with mental illness, and the platform is actually genious.  The Company saw the need for access to 24/7 1-on-1 mental health care via online service, which is much more accessible for individuals who require immediate care or are care 
avoidant.  The service is widely used by people with substance abuse issues, veterans, trauma survivors, etc.  Furthermore, The Company's modelling showed that providing
this type of health care online caused a huge savings benefit for the medical system and insurance companies on the whole, because it treated the issues at the source, online and often prevented very expensive post incident care (think of police and hospital resources).  Insurance companies, and even Medicare and Medicaid, were aware of the savings and included The Company's services in their health insurance plans.  The Company's stock saw a meteoric rise from about $3 to over $100 as more insurance
companies signed on to the service.

Then what?:

In early 2019, The Company's stock was trading between $10-$15.  A short selling research company under the name ""Culper Research"" began covering the stock, and took particular
issue with The Company's CEO at the time.  Culper Research itself is neither a company or really a legit entity.  It operates under pseudonyms and behind proxy servers, with no real way of contacting them through any legitimate means.  Often, websites that they operate to provide their ""research"" publicly are registered to law offices or shell companies in the Caribbean or South Pacific.  They mostly attack companies through social media platforms like twitter, stocktwits, shady websites, etc and then pay to have articles submitted through the newswire via their offshore company.  Anyway, it was Culper's opinion at the time that The Company would be unable to secure insurance companies into their behavioural health services system so they provided research attacking ""The Company's"" CEO.  

The intial Culper hit piece was fairly tame, it questioned The Company's fundamentals and ability to sign clients.  Culper took particular beef with the CEO and filled the report with the usual FUD.  The report coincided with a hedge fund taking a MASSIVE SHORT POSITION AGAINST THE COMPANY, AMOUNTING TO 40% OF ALL AVAILABLE SHARES.  So there was a lot of money behind this ""research"" and a huge interest in The Company's failure.  Things didn't go well for Culper and the hedge funds associated with them, and The Company signed more insurance companies and clients and the stock kept rising.   

This is when things turned ugly.  Let me say this, I have never seen anything so disgusting published across the newswire without any sort of legal repercussion.  Culper Research paired with Hindenburg Research and stepped up their attacks immensely.  You apes familiar with the GME short seller reports know how ugly they can get.  In the subsequent reports, Culper and Hindenburg accused the CEO of embezzlement, sex crimes, fraud, misapproriation of shareholder money and even supporting wars.  Racist jabs
and questioning the character of the care providers were all listed in the report.  The Company's stock briefly fell, but recovered and kept rising in spite of the report.  Upon reading it, I contacted The Company's investor relations and notified them of the report, which they said they were aware of and could not discuss how they were addressing this legally.  The report was deleted from Culper and Hindenburg's website at a later date (of course).

Well, the stock kept rising.

Culper and Hindenburg needed to step it up because their hedge fund clients were losing hundreds of millions of dollars.  And step it up they did.  They began publishing reports almost twice a week and referring to them over the newswire and spamming them across twitter.  Stock message boards became flooded with individuals who would hyperlink the reports they issued and spread FUD.  Message boards that were generally quiet were flooded with bearish messages and false statements.  Culper and Hindenburg stepped up their illegal activity, which was admitted in their own reports, by contacting health care workers who work for the platform by pretending to need to behavioural health services
they provided.  They would mask as being suicidal or depressed, and then they would press the health care workers about their pay, compensation packages, what they know about the CEO and the company, which health care insurance companies did they use, etc.  Culper and Hindenburg then released their findings in their weekly (almost daily) reports.
For example, they'd write 'when we contacted the clinician using their service, they told us that they only worked 20 hours a week and that they were not receiving compensation for 
mental stress'.

Still, the stock kept rising.  Once again I contacted The Company and notified them that Culper and Hindenburg were contacting health care employees to uncover confidential information, 
and that they were spinning it to create FUD.  The Company said that they were aware of the issue and that they were advising their staff to be wary.

Culper and Hindenburg then began issuing reports which had patient information included.  This was done to scare patients into thinking that their information was not secure.  Once again, this was all in their reports.  My guess is that they had one of their own people hired by The Company, and this 'health care provider' proded patients for information.  Either that, or they were just flat out lying.  The reports would say, 'patient did not have any reduction in suicidal thoughts', 'patient did not feel better at the end of the session', 'several patients felt 
confused after the session'.  They would couple this information with a decline in client retention rates or turnover.  Remember, these are extremely vulnerable, often care avoidant individuals, who are desperate for mental health care.  This is a sickening act in my opinion!  I contacted The Company and notified them that Culper and Hindenburg were releasing client information and discussions in their reports and The Company gave me the usual response.  The stock kept rising.

In my opinion, their latest nasty shot at The Company could very well be the worst.  This is opinion and can not be proven, but I suspect it to be true.  The Company's largest signed client
was Aetna Health Insurance followed by Cigna.  It is my opinion that Culper and Hindenburg began to lobby Aetna and Cigna with their false reports, accusations, FUD, and the 
patient information on an almost daily basis.  The goal was to have these health insurance providers drop The Company's mental health services from their insurance plans.  Many veterans and individuals locked at home with abusers or their own thoughts during the Covid crisis are dependant on these services in order to get through their day-to-day, and can not afford the care unless it is covered by their health insurance plans.  Well, if they were lobbying, it worked.  Aetna abruptly terminated their agreement with The Company, and thousands of patients were forced to lose care with their health care provider or be transitioned to another provider.  This was devastating.  Hundreds of health care service providers lost their jobs, and thousands of patients will likely no longer get the care they require.  Upon announcing the termination of the contract with Aetna, the stock dropped from $105 to about $28 or so.

I notified the company that Aetna was likely lobbied by Culper and Hindenburg, and they responded that they needed to focus on patient care and patient transitioning at the moment, but that A NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS HAD MADE THEM AWARE OF THIS.  Culper and Hindenburg have since deleted all these reports from their websites and Twitter accounts, however The Company has all the reports and so do I.

Now the hedge funds that backed Culper and Hindenburg still have a big problem.  Despite the fall in the stock price, the trading volume has been extremely low and they have been unable to cover most of their short position.  The stock is still currently shorted to the tune of about 36% of the free float.  On top of that, much of their short position was taken between
$10-$15 per share, so they are still way underwater.  On top of that, the company is recovering.  They are signing Medicare and Medicaid care contracts.  They are signing a service
provision contract with Veteran's Affairs directly.  Recently, the Biden administration has earmarked $96bn for the VA and VA mental health services in the new $6tn budget.  The CEO of The Company resigned his position and a new CEO, a veteran in the health care industry, was brought on as CEO.  I believe the new CEO will be much more ruthless with Culper and 
Hindenburg, and I believe that this is why they have deleted a lot of their research.  If I were a betting man, I'd say that they have multiple lawsuits coming their way.

Why did I write this?:

A friend of mine was a military helicopter pilot who served in Afghanistan.  He was a career military kind of guy, who really loved his job and serving his Country.  When he came back from Afghanistan, he completely changed.  A normally outgoing person, he became withdrawn, anti-social, and began behaving oddly.  He confided in his close friends that he was struggling
with mental health issues, but was afraid to seek help because of the stigma attached to it and fear of losing his rank.  This is someone who would have benefited immensely from these services because they are 24/7, confidential, and covered through health insurance.  Sadly, he didn't get the help he needed and committed suicide in 2017.  

Was Culper or Hindenburg ever held responsible for their actions?  Do they simply withdraw into the woodwork?  Will they continue to lobby other insurance providers in an attempt to drive the price down further?  How many lives were lost and will be lost by people who are told that they no longer have access to mental health care services?

I’m watching it closely, but I feel like I have been beating my head against the wall because no one does anything to hold them accountable.

Finance ministers meeting in London agreed to commit to the principle of a minimum corporate tax rate of 15%. 

>The deal - from the US, UK, France, Germany, Canada, Italy and Japan - will put pressure on other countries to follow suit, including at a meeting of the G20 next month.

>At the moment companies can set up local branches in countries that have relatively low corporate tax rates and declare profits there.

>That means they only pay the local rate of tax, even if the profits mainly come from sales made elsewhere. This is legal and commonly done.

>The deal aims to stop this from happening in two ways.

>Firstly, the G7 want a global minimum tax rate so as to avoid a ""race to the bottom"" where countries can undercut each other with low tax rates.

>Secondly, the rules will aim to make companies pay tax in the countries where they are selling their products or services, rather than wherever they end up declaring their profits.

If a country provides the infrastructure, talent, and resources for a company to create and generate valuable intellectual property (e.g., patents, formulas, proprietary  technology, etc.)... do you think they will find it fair that another country make reap higher tax revenue benefits because of patronage when the property is created and developed in their own?

Why?

For a starter, they only agreed in principle, which is meaningless. How an actual global legislation or agreement on taxation would look like or be enforced is all to be seen. Until you see the paper, this is just an empty promise to a room full of journalist. 

Secondly, even the principle (15% minimum corporate tax rate globally) is meaningless, because all the 7 countries have already higher tax rate. What they would need to do is close tax loops that allow corporates to LEGALLY move profits abroad. For this they don’t need any globs treaty, they can just change their local tax codes. 

Finally, tax ‘competition’ is encouraged in the European Union (which many of these countries belong to) and in general globally. 

Let’s start with Europe. Inside the EU Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Ireland, Cyprus, Malta and to some extent Greece (on ship taxation) all use lower corporate taxation to their benefit at the expense of larger EU states. Geographicaly inside the EU, Switzerland also does. The EU is a dead project that is reluctant of any change since 20+ years. These countries all have vast power inside EU insitutions and have used it consinstely to make sure legislation is not changed in regard of ‘tax competition’ between EU members. In plain terms, EU members couldn’t even agree on a common travel policy in times of covid (with good riddance to the principles of Schenghen and weaponization of COVID issues against Britain in times of brexit), do you think they will ever agree to have a minimum corporate tax? 

Outside the EU, the USA already has one of the lowest tax rates for a developed country.  Of course Biden now signs these ‘agreements’ and promises change, but believe me the USA have very little to earn or lose from different corporate tax when they only represent something like 6% of total tax revenues as of 2020. Add that they are only talking about making the minimum 15%... which is below what they already have. Nothing would really change for them. 

What actually matters is to close tax loops that allow companies to not pay taxes in the countries where they register profit. To do so, the US does not need any global agreement and neither does Europe. They should just change their respective tax codes ...which they won’t do. 

Reminds me of some news a few months ago when banks and big corporations in the USA signed some sort of agreement saying that from there on they would consider their impact on the environment and not only return to shareholders. Have you ever heard anything from them ever since?

Maybe the US and India to make it simple. So the costs to generate the income don’t match the location the income was generated.

It’s just obvious because they have the same name. You can make a law changing tax’s for companies with the same parent company but the companies will just reform to be separate to match the new tax structure.

So as long as you are not borrowing money from your broker and stick to the funds that you deposited you will be fine.  You will only get margin called (the only time they will close one of your positions) if they feel your ability to be able to pay off the margin loan is at risk.  This happens when the stocks you are using as collateral go down that the safety buffer they make you maintain in your account becomes too small for the size of your loan.  When the broker shows you your buying power that is how much they will let you spend including any money they are willing to lend you.  You should also pay attention to how much actual cash you have in your account if you don't want to take a margin loan.  My guess is in your play account you spent more than your ""deposit"" amount and thus had a margin loan.

2. The debt only grows until you pay it back by selling something. It is effectively a constant while the share price and your account value fluctuate.

3. ""Margin"" is the amount of your account that would be yours if you sold everything and paid all the debt. ""Margin debt"" is the amount you borrowed.

4. Margin can be cash or stock, though some high-risk stocks are not usable as margin.

5. The minimum margin need to open a new position is almost always more than the minimum margin you have to maintain after that. Usually the numbers are 50% (meaning you can borrow up to half) and 30% (when the price drops and debt covers more than 70% of your holdings, they give you a ""margin call,"" demanding you deposit more margin; if you don't meet the deadline they sell your holdings until you meet the requirements; you have no right to tell them what to sell in that case, they have all the rights).

Now, if we try to apply the same to stocks. Bob and Mary buy stocks of ABC company, whose stocks don’t pay dividends . In this case, the money Bob and Mary invest is used by the company to run its business. The company uses this money , but unlike real-estate, the earning of the company is not divided among the investors. Instead, the company re-invests the earnings into their business. By the end of the year, the stock prices have grown by 12 %. Bob and Mary sell their stocks. Who pays for this 12%? Another investor who is willing to buy the comapany’s stock at a higher price? So many companies choose to not pay dividends/pay very small dividends. I donot understand what the appeal of a stock is, if the companies are not sharing their earnings with investors.

This also means that owning a stock entitle you to the companies future earnings. So by reinvesting your earnings rather than having them paid out as dividends you can increase your future cash flows and the potential for a higher dividend.

Companies therefore have three primary ways of returning capital to shareholders.

1: increase future cash flows by investing into growth or efficiency.

2: increasing shareholder ownership stake via share buybacks.

3: paying a dividend."

However, the company still has value without dividends. The company assets are your assets. Look at BRKB, they don't pay dividends yet they still traded at levels above zero. Why?

Bottom line, you need to understand stock as ownership. Owners can make money off a company one of two ways. They can receive a share of the profits (dividends) or they can benefit from the company’s rise in value. How do they benefit from a rise in value? It’s very easy if you imagine a company with only one owner. Let’s say they want to sell their company. How much can they get for it? Let’s say a million dollars. But then, they have a banner year. Their sales go through the roof, they open new locations. Will the owner still sell his business for a million dollars? No, of course not. They’ll ask for more money. 

The same exact principle applies even if you only own a fraction of the business. All shares trade at the same price, so your individual share is worth just as much as an individual share owned by someone who owns half the company. If someone wanted to expand their ownership stake, and you want to sell, you’re selling to them. If the company is bigger and people are willing to pay more for it, you benefit. If a company is a stinker, the price will go down and people will be willing to pay less for it. 

Ultimately, neither dividends or growth is necessarily better than one another. In the growth model, what would have been your dividend is instead invested in the business, making it grow and become more valuable. 

Price can become detached from fundamentals, of course. But usually long term prices revert to fair valuation. 

This is one reason why buying the “Stop of Game” at these levels is wildly risky... it’s hard to imagine anyone wanting to actually buy the company at this valuation. Will it actually be worth this much someday in the future? Jury is out."

So, they can use the proceed to invest in the companies operations to scale the business to “grow” so the stock will grow. 

Because, growth stocks offer you ROI later by the growth of the company they tend not to offer dividend.

**$SLM** 

Sector: Financial Industry: Credit service

Sallie Mae is a loan service that specializes in private student loans. Once a government-sponsored enterprise, they became their own private company in 2004. 

For a bachelors degree it is estimated to be around 11k a year. 44k in total for the degree. Personally something feels way off with that, might be anecdotal but I truly don’t think that its that cheap. That statistic likely leaves off some important factors- housing, food, and general living expenses. But I digress…

70% of Americans have less Than $1,000 in a Savings Account. Of course its hard to say how many of that 70% are attending or plan to attend college. Either way, we can assume most individuals can’t cough up an extra 11k a year, especially students who are living on their own. That’s where private loans come in. They are extra flexible with payments, allow for cosigners 

Now for the bad part- publicity.  “If you know the name, you know the pain” that is the first result in google when you type “sallie mae reddit”. Not a great look, especially when you are looking for loans and you stumble across how awful sallie mae is and how its ruining people’s finances. How bad is this for the company? Well its hard to say, but considering Nestle exists despite, well despite itself I suppose, I think sallie mae can weather the publicity.

# **AMC, meme stocks could spark more heat in the week ahead as investors await inflation news - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/04/amc-meme-stocks-could-spark-more-heat-in-the-week-ahead-as-investors-await-inflation-news.html)**
*****
> Inflation data is a highlight of the week ahead, as investors focus on economic news in the void between earnings season and the next Fed meeting.
*****
> May’s consumer price index is scheduled to be reported Thursday, and it could be hot after it surged in April. Inflation is viewed as an important trigger that could cause the Federal Reserve to step back from its easy policies, if rising prices appear to be hotter and more persistent than expected.
*****
> Equities were higher in the past week, but the meme stocks were far hotter. AMC Entertainment gained another 100% and was up 2,700% since January.
*****
> Energy was the best-performing major sector, gaining more than 6.7% as oil prices jumped nearly 5% in the past week. REITs were the second-best performer, up 3.1%, followed by financials, up 1.2% and technology, also up 1.2%.
*****
> But it’s the meme stocks that took the headlines, and also contributed to concerns about froth in the stock market.
*****
> “People think this is new. It completely isn’t,” Dan Niles, founder of Satori Fund, said of the trading frenzy. He noted there was similar froth in individual stocks in 1999, when companies added dot-com to their names to attract investor attention.
*****
> “What’s new is the fact that these traders are armed with stimulus checks. They can organize more easily on things like WallStreetBets, they can work from home, and there’s no-cost trading. Those are the differences,” Niles said on CNBC.
*****
> “So, if it gets people interested in investing, that’s great. What I don’t like is when you have people sort of taking out mortgages on their home, and putting themselves at risk if the thing collapsed,” he added. “You want to be able to invest what you can afford to lose if you’re going to play in something like this.”
*****
> Steve Massocca, managing director at Wedbush Securities, said the trading in names like GameStop and Bed Bath & Beyond is one of the things that has made him more cautious about the market. He said the high valuations on the meme names are unlikely to last. “It’s going to be around as long as cicadas are,” he said.
*****
> The S&P 500 in the past week gained 0.6%, rising to 4,229, just 9 points from its all-time high. The Dow was up 0.7% to 34,756, and the Nasdaq gained 0.5% to 13,814.
*****
> # Watching the inflation signs
> Massocca said investors should stay focused on things like inflation, since that could be what makes the Federal Reserve reverse its easy policy. The Fed has so far said it sees the higher inflation readings as transitory.
*****
> Economists expect CPI to be up 4.7% year over year, after April’s 4.2% pace, according to Dow Jones. Core inflation is expected to be up 0.4% for the month and 3.4% year over year.
*****
> “I’m getting nervous. I’m seeing signs of a top. I’m systematically raising cash. I think the market looks too expensive,” Massocca said. “We’re going to shake off the dust from Covid. The economy is going to be very, very good and as a rule, I think monetary policy is going to respond to some degree.”
*****
> He said the memes mania is just one sign, but the spark for a sell-off could be anything including a hawkish comment from the Fed.
*****
> “Who knows what it is, but the kindling is building and as soon as a match hits it, the market is setting up for a 7% to 10% pullback at some point,” he said. “Who knows what starts it. ... One of the candidates very likely will be some kind of reductions in monetary policy.”
*****
> Fear of the Fed stepping back from its easy policy has been hanging over the market.
*****
> Friday’s May employment report was being watched closely, but the lower-than-expected job gains reinforced that the Fed could continue to hold off on policy changes for the time being. There were 559,000 jobs added in May, well below the 671,000 expected.
*****
> Now the CPI report is the next point of focus, ahead of the Fed’s June 15-16 meeting. The question is, will it be so hot that the central bank may have to reassess its view about the temporary nature of inflation, or could it show that price increases are peaking?
*****
> “There’s inflation out there. You can see it everywhere,” said Massocca.
*****
> # Taper talk
> The market has been expecting the Fed to begin to talk about unwinding its bond buying later this year, with many strategists targeting the Fed’s Jackson Hole, Wyoming, symposium at the end of August. The Fed is expected to first discuss cutting back its purchases months ahead of taking action. Then it will slowly reduce its buying.
*****
> After that, it could consider interest rate hikes, now not expected by the market until 2023.
*****
> Niles said the meme stock trend has been fueled in part by the Fed. The markets are awash in liquidity as the central bank keeps rates at zero and maintains its monthly purchases of at least $120 billion in Treasury and mortgage securities.
*****
> “When the Fed backs off of that with tapering, I think that’s when you can go in and say, ‘OK’ we can potentially go after and short some of these highly valued names because that’s when the free money disappears and you actually start to contract some of that free money,” he said. “That’s when things start to get dangerous to the downside.”
*****
> For now, Niles said he’s staying away from the names that are heavily sought by retail investors or have large short interest and are targeted by Wall Street. “You want to stay away from this stuff now unless you’re doing it in very small size,” he said.
*****
> There are just a few earnings in the week ahead. One of the handful of names reporting is meme name GameStop on Wednesday. Campbell Soup also reports that day, and Chewy reports Thursday.
*****
> G-7 finance ministers meet this weekend, and President Joe Biden will attend a meeting of the organization’s leaders in Cornwall, England, on Friday.

> # May Payrolls Not Too Hot, Not Too Cold

> Before diving into today’s jobs report for May, it will be a useful exercise to recall the curveball that April’s report threw at investors.

> One of the more hotly contested topics investors have been debating recently is what to make of the jobs report released one month ago, where the consensus expectation was for 1,000,000 new jobs and we only got 266,000 (since revised up to 278,000). On the one hand, data releases are volatile by nature and it is possible that the large miss could have been broadly dismissed as a “one off” among a package of otherwise very healthy economic data. On the other hand, it did confirm anecdotal evidence of difficult hiring conditions facing companies and reinforced the notion that some workers may be reluctant to return to the workforce for a whole host of reasons. Moreover, if the April report really did unearth new evidence of a weaker-than-expected jobs market in this latter scenario, should we view the effect as temporary or does it have staying power that could spell new trouble for the overall economic recovery?

> Against this backdrop, investors were hoping that today’s May jobs report would go a long way towards providing some definitive answers to these important questions.

> It did not. But, that might actually be a good thing. Here are some key takeaways:

> * The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ May employment report revealed that the domestic economy added 559,000 jobs in May, slightly below Bloomberg-surveyed economists’ median forecast for a gain of 675,000. The prior two months also received net positive revisions of 27,000 jobs.

> * The unemployment rate fell more than expected to 5.8%, though that was paired with a disappointing drop in the labor force participation rate, which moved from 61.7% to 61.6%.

> * Average hourly earnings rose 0.5% month over month, again signaling lower-wage workers did not rejoin the workforce to the degree expected. More new lower-wage jobs would be expected to put more downward pressure on wage increases.

> “It is hard to view 559,000 added jobs as a disappointment, but it does leave something to be desired,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market > Strategist Ryan Detrick. “There is strong potential for job prints in excess of one million over the coming months, but the truth is as strong as the economy is right now, the employment backdrop is clearly lagging what we were all expecting just a few months ago.”

> As seen in the LPL Chart of the Day, May’s jobs number did jump above April’s disappointment, but still came well short of making a fresh new high for 2021.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/6.4.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> Where do we go from here? The US economy is still 7.6 million total payrolls shy of its peak prior to the recession, and given the magnitude of that number, we still believe there is the potential for strong upside surprises for at least the next several months. Several catalysts should also lend a helping hand in the near future. Enhanced unemployment benefits may be deterring lower-wage workers from returning to the labor market, as they reduce the relative attractiveness of a paycheck from an employer. In the last month, about half of all states have started eliminating these added benefits in order to reduce the disincentive. We believe this should show up in the data starting with the June employment report. Also, schools might be closing for the summer, but daycare centers are reopening more broadly, freeing parents up to find jobs. Warmer weather, ever-improving vaccination trends, and increasing comfort reengaging in normal activities should all play their parts as well.

> The labor market will always be inextricably linked to the inflation outlook, this cycle perhaps more than past cycles, and for many that is the real story today. The Federal Reserve (Fed) has made it clear it will tolerate near-term inflation overshoots in order to achieve “substantial further progress” towards its employment goals before it begins taking measures to combat higher inflation. Recent hotter-than-expected inflation reports have increasingly turned the spotlight towards the Fed’s timeline for reducing their asset purchases, which, given their stated position, will depend on strong payroll reports. As such, we find ourselves (to a degree) in a “good news is bad news” scenario, as strong labor market readings could hasten the Fed’s timetable to begin normalizing monetary policy.

> Today’s report likely did little to convince the Fed that the labor market is closer to meeting its “substantial further progress” goal on employment, and therefore, all else equal, will not compel them to consider reducing asset purchases sooner rather than later. There is much ground still to be made up in the labor market, and we believe the Fed will need to see a string of strong reports, likely in the one million range, before it begins to take action. From a Fed intervention standpoint, today’s employment report likely found a sweet spot, and the early indications are that equity markets are breathing a sigh of relief.

> For a deeper dive into the inflation picture, check the blog on Thursday, June 10, when data for the Consumer Price Index (CPI) measure of inflation is set to be released.

> # Big First 5 Months Gains Consolidate Over Worst Months

> S&P 500 is up an impressive 11.9% for the first five months of 2021. That is the 16th best gain for the first five months since 1950. As illustrated in the graph above, gains do beget gains and this bodes well for the year as a whole. But this does not diminish the seasonal pattern of consolidation and mostly sideways market action over the Worst Six Months May-October and even more so over the Worst Four Months July-October.

> We tabulated the gains for the top 20 first five month gains since 1950 and the gains for the last seven months of the year are still pretty solid averaging 9.4% vs. 14.7% for the top 20 first five months. But the bulk of those gains as you can see in the graph come from late-October to yearend.

> # June Swoon?

> Although there was some notable weakness in the middle of May, the S&P 500 Index was able to rally late in the month to finish with a modest gain. Incredibly, this was the eighth year out of the past nine that stocks gained during in May. Who said Sell in May?

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/6.2.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> As we noted a month ago, the worst six months of the year indeed are May through October, so we are still in the thick of a potentially challenging period based on seasonality. “After a nearly 90% rally off the lows, stocks could be ripe for a pullback, especially during the historically weak month of June,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “But with the improving economy, coupled with historic fiscal and monetary stimulus, we expect any weakness to be short-lived.”

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/6.2.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

> Here are some stats to think about regarding S&P 500 performance in June:

> * Since 1950, June is the 4th worst month of the year (September, February, and August are worse).

> * It has been higher the past 5 years in a row, the longest since a stretch of 6 in a row in the late 1990s.

> * The past 10 years, though, June was up 1.0% on average, ranking as the 7th best month.

> * According to Sam Stovall of CFRA, only 5 market declines in excess of 5% started in June versus an average of 8 for all 12 months (since WWII). In other words, it isn’t common for major market weakness to start in June.

> * Building on this, when the S&P 500 is lower in June, it is down by 2.9% on average. This is the second smallest average loss, with only December better at -2.5%.

> We wouldn’t be surprised at all if stocks took a well-deserved break in June, but this month is rather misunderstood, as a massive sell-off or the start of significant weakness isn’t likely, as that isn’t what June typically brings.

> Lastly, last Wednesday marked the 100th trading day of the year for the S&P 500. In fact, the S&P 500 was up more than 10% on the 100th day, which historically is a great start to the year, but also has meant continued strong performance the rest of the year is quite normal.

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, when stocks are up more than 10% on day 100, the rest of the year has been higher 84.2% of the time and up 8.6% on average, both well above what the average year does. We continue to recommend an overweight to equities and underweight to fixed-income position relative to investors’ targets, as appropriate.

> # Less Than 20% Bearish For the First Time in 115 Weeks

> Bullish sentiment measured through the AAII weekly survey was at the lowest level since the fall last week, but after jumping 7.7 percentage points, it is now at the highest level since the end of April. Not only is it high relative to the past few weeks, but the increase also brings bullish sentiment 6 percentage points back above its historical average. Additionally, the week over week increase was the largest since the week of April 8th when the reading had risen 11.1 percentage points.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/06/060321-AAII-Bull.png))**

> In recent weeks, neutral sentiment had been surging; topping 37% last week for the highest reading since the first week of 2020. Although it reversed lower this week down to 36.2%, neutral sentiment remains around some of the strongest levels in over a year.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/06/060321-AAII-Neut.png))**

> With the pickup in bullish sentiment, bearish sentiment plummeted to 19.8% on a 6.6 percentage point decile; the largest since February. Falling below 20%, bearish sentiment took out its March and April lows and is now at the lowest level since January 2018.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/06/060321-AAII-Bear.png))**

> Not only is that one of the lowest readings in bearish sentiment in recent history, but that drop below 20% brought to an end a 115-week long streak of readings in bearish sentiment above that level. As shown below, that surpassed a three-week shorter streak ending in December 2017 to make for the second-longest such streak on record. The longest streak which ended in December 2010 went on for more than twice as long as this most recent run.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/06/060321-AAII-Cons-Above-20.png))**

> Historically, lower readings in bearish sentiment have tended towards weaker performance for the S&P 500 going forward as shown below. But when it comes to the past times that bearish sentiment has broken below 20% for the first time in at least 50 weeks, performance has actually tended to consistently be positive. In fact, across each of the past six instances, the S&P 500 has been higher six months out every time. Granted, for the most part the typical move higher is usually smaller than other periods.

> # Typical June Trading: Any Early Gains Tend to Fade Especially After Mid-Month

> Over the last twenty-one years, the month of June has been a rather lackluster month for the market. DJIA, S&P 500 and Russell 1000 have all recorded average losses in the month. NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have faired better with modest average gains. Historically the month has opened respectably, advancing on the first and second trading days. From there the market then drifted sideways and lower into or near negative territory depending upon index just ahead of mid-month. Here the market rallied to create a nice mid-month bulge that quickly evaporated and turned into losses. The brisk, post, mid-month drop is typically followed by a month end rally lead by technology and small-caps.

> # Main Street Sentiment Strongest in Over a Decade

> The U.S. economy is opening up and overall sentiment on Main Street is the strongest it’s been since our earliest analysis in 2005, according to LPL Research’s proprietary Beige Book Barometer (BBB). The result is based on our analysis of the Federal Reserve’s Beige Book, a publication released two weeks before each Fed policy meeting that captures qualitative observations made by community bankers and business owners—what we like to think of as “Main Street” rather than “Wall Street.” The BBB gauges Main Street’s sentiment by looking at how frequently key words and phrases appear in the text.

> In the most recent Beige Book, “strong” words were near their highest since we first began tracking data in 2005 while weak words were their lowest on record, resulting in the strongest overall sentiment reading since inception. The strong reading is likely driven more by a change in direction than in overall activity, but even that is a welcome shift.

> “The country and the economy are going through a disruptive but positive change as most COVID-related restrictions are lifted and the economy reopens,” said LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Sentiment is up and that’s a great sign for the direction of the economy.”

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/6.3.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> This was an important Beige Book in other ways. Mentions of COVID-related words (virus, COVID, pandemic) fell to their lowest level since the March 2020 Beige Book, when the words first started to appear. More concerning, words related to inflation also rose to their highest level since our earliest analysis. The downside of the economy’s rapid acceleration has been a mismatch between demand, which can ramp up quickly, and supply, which comes on line more slowly, while labor markets have also been slow to keep pace with reopening.

> Overall, the fundamental backdrop for the economy remains positive. Supply chain disruptions can slow the pace of the economic rebound but are likely temporary, while we expect reopening to be enduring. There is still some risk around variants, however, and full supply chain relief will likely need support from accelerated global vaccine distribution. US economic acceleration will probably peak in the second quarter, but there’s still plenty of scope for growth to moderate and still remain above average. Much of the positive news is already priced in for equity markets, which are forward looking, and gains may not come as easily, but we still see solid potential for upside as the economy continues to rebound.

> # S&P 500 Returns Relative to History

> May has moved back to the rearview mirror and with that, we wanted to provide an update on how current long-term returns for the S&P 500 stack up relative to history. The chart below compares the trailing one, two, five, ten, and twenty-year annualized total returns of the S&P 500 to the S&P 500's historical average returns over those same time periods since 1928.

> We're starting to move away from the 'easy comps' in terms of market returns relative to the March 2020 lows, but the S&P 500 is still up more than 40% over the last 12 months which is nearly four times the historical average one year return. Over the last two years, the S&P 500's annualized return of 25.8% still comes in at more than twice the historical average of 10.6%. On a five and ten-year basis, the S&P 500's annualized gain also remains comfortably above 10%. All in all, the last decade has been very good for US equity investors. The only time period where the S&P 500 has experienced below-average returns is at the 20-year window where the 8.4% annualized gain clocks in at 2.5 percentage less than the historical average of 10.9%.

> The chart below compares the S&P 500's current returns over the last one, two, five, ten, and twenty years to all other periods on a percentile basis. With mostly above-average returns, it comes as no surprise that most of the percentile readings rank above the 50th percentile, and for most time periods, the percentile rank comes in well above 50%. The one-year total return of more than 40% actually ranks just above the 93rd percentile, while the two-year return isn't far from the 90th percentile either. Moving further out, each of the other readings going out to ten years are all well above the 50th percentile. The only percentile rank below the 50th percentile is the 20-year window and that reading isn't even close. On the one hand, the last ten years have been phenomenal for equity investors, but the last 20 years haven't even been mediocre.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/06/060221-Percentile-Rank1.png))**

> Throughout history, many investors have always worked under the assumption that long-term returns for the equity market are about 10%. History has shown that to be the case over the last decade at least, as the average annualized one-year gain of the S&P 500 has been well above 10%. With the S&P 500's current 20-year annualized gain currently at just 8.4%, though, what will it take for the S&P 500 to reach double-digit gains on an annualized basis over a 20-year window?

> For an idea, given the strong performance of the last ten years, a number of commentators suggest that the next ten years for equities will be weak with a reversion to the mean. Only time will tell, but if we operate under the (unlikely) assumption that the S&P 500 stays at the exact same level it is now going forward for the next ten years, its annualized twenty-year return would top 10% for the first time since August 2008 next September. After that brief period above 10% from September 2022 through March 2023, it wouldn't again top that level until February 2029. In spite of the fact that the annualized 20-year return would top 10% in those two periods, though, it still wouldn't get as high as the historical average of 10.9% in either of those periods. This reflects the fact that although the last ten years for US equities have been very strong, they also came shortly after one of the worst ten-year periods for US equities on record.

2021-06-05 00:00:00,stocks,"Argentine stocks soared these past two weeks. Why? Screening with [FinViz](https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=111&f=fa_pe_low,ta_perf_1w10o&ft=4&o=country) I noticed Argentine stocks have soared over 15%, some even over 20% this past week. I haven't read any news (either in English or Spanish newspapers) that would suggest this rally. In fact, Argentine banks had [pretty bad earnings lately](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/argentine-banks-q1-earnings-out-brazil-s-indusval-to-undergo-restructuring-59030778) and the country is experiencing a dreadful second wave of COVID-19.

So what gives?"

2021-06-05 17:26:49,stocks,"Emerging markets are starting to heat up basically. Money will flow out of the US now seeking markets that will benefit from Covid recovery as US is ""priced in"". Expect London and European to be the first ones and then parts of Asia and Latin America as progress on vaccinations expands.

TLDR: Foreign investment flow out of US."
2021-06-05 10:58:43,stocks,Talking in Hindsight: this month are many public elections in Latin America. Maybe investors are looking for other markets that will not have any public office elections.
2021-06-05 11:10:40,stocks,"I bought some stock in an Argentina bank a bit over a month ago and yes, it has been doing very well.  Why did I buy?  Mainly because everybody seems to hate Argentina investments.   The chart was down, down, down, but then it started to break out.  I know that stocks are priced primarily on popularity, so if you buy when they are widely hated and starting to catch a bid, you can make a ton of money if they come back in favor.  The cash flow of this bank was steady when measured in US dollars and the bank is run by a wealthy family who have a lot of skin in the game."
2021-06-05 12:58:49,stocks,"driverless.

Also we are very cheap and the market is really small...so with very little $$ we can skyrocket."

2021-06-05 00:00:00,stocks,"Lululemon first-quarter sales rise 88%, topping estimates, as store traffic rebounds Lululemon Athletica said Thursday its fiscal first-quarter revenue soared 88%, topping analysts’ estimates, as shopper traffic steadily rebounded to its stores.

The athletic apparel maker also issued a strong forecast for its fiscal second quarter and raised full-year estimates, saying momentum for its brand is growing across all geographies.


Its stock rose less than 1% on the news in extended trading.

Here’s how Lululemon did for the period ended May 2, compared with what analysts were anticipating, based on a Refinitiv survey:

Earnings per share: $1.16 adjusted vs. 91 cents expected
Revenue: $1.23 billion vs. $1.13 billion expected
Net income grew to $145 million, or $1.11 per share, from $28.6 million, or 22 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time charges, Lululemon earned $1.16 a share, better than the 91 cents per shares that analysts estimated.

Revenue rose to $1.23 billion from $652 million a year earlier, when its stores were temporarily shut. That came in ahead of expectations for $1.13 billion.

On a two-year basis, sales grew 57%. Lululemon also said its men’s business grew faster from 2019 levels than its women’s.


The Covid pandemic has fueled shopper demand for fitness gear to wear around the house and to dress for at-home workouts such as running and spin biking. The trend, which hasn’t appeared to slow down, has benefited companies including Lululemon, Nike and Under Armour. It has also boosted more traditional retailers such as Gap, which recently said activewear sales continue to drive sales at both its Athleta and Old Navy banners.

Lululemon’s direct-to-consumer revenue climbed 55% to $545.1 million year over year. Sales in North America were up 82% and increased 125% internationally.

CEO Calvin McDonald told analysts Thursday that Lululemon still expects its international business will grow in size to be equal to its North American operations in the near future. At the end of 2020, international sales represented only 14% of Lululemon’s total business.

The company also owns the at-home fitness platform Mirror, a rival to Peloton. Lululemon expects Mirror to drive between $250 million and $275 million in revenue this year.

CFO Meghan Frank said momentum has remained strong in recent weeks. The company continues to invest in innovative merchandise to drum up excitement. It recently launched a line of products that use lower-impact dyes, and it is piloting a trade-in and resale program.

For its fiscal second quarter, Lululemon expects adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $1.10 to $1.15, on sales of $1.3 billion to $1.33 billion. Analysts had been looking for earnings of $1.01 per share on revenue of $1.20 billion, according to a Refinitiv survey.

For the year, it’s calling for adjusted earnings of $6.73 to $6.86 per share, on sales of $5.83 billion to $5.91 billion. Analysts expected it to earn $6.48 per share on sales of $5.68 billion.

Previously, Lululemon had been calling for fiscal 2021 revenue to be in a range of $5.55 billion to $5.65 billion.

“We were performing well before the pandemic, I think we led the peer group during the pandemic, and we’re excited about ... our ability to continue to perform post-pandemic,” McDonald said.

Lululemon shares are down about 9% year to date. It has a market cap of $41.4 billion. Lululemon Athletica said Thursday its fiscal first-quarter revenue soared 88%, topping analysts’ estimates, as shopper traffic steadily rebounded to its stores.

2021-06-04 23:35:54,stocks,All those ladies that have been working out during quarantine need to show off there asses of steel. I love you Lululemon. God bless.
2021-06-05 00:01:41,stocks,Thanks for the copy and paste?  Low effort
2021-06-05 00:42:31,stocks,Priced in

2021-06-05 19:14:17,stocks,"> show off there asses

at $sbux in morning ordering those pink drinks"
2021-06-05 09:27:20,stocks,U clearly haven’t worn lululemon
2021-06-05 00:00:00,stocks,"Reduce AAPL from 10% to 5%. Up my MSFT to 10% or add some AVGO. I'm thinking of reducing my AAPL from about 10% of portfolio to around 5% and increasing my MSFT from 8 to 10%.  Or adding some AVGO.

This is in taxable, but the AAPL shares in question have just gone long for capital gains.

Good move?  I feel a tough road ahead for AAPL as opposed to MSFT and or something like AVGO."
2021-06-04 23:39:11,stocks,Love MSFT and Cloud much more
2021-06-05 00:13:09,stocks,"This question is going to elicit responses with bias.  AAPL & MSFT are both great companies.  

I'll enter my own random redditor bias here... My personal position is that AAPL will continue to do better both in the short(ish) term and long.  

Every product/service AAPL makes has ridiculous margins... but justifiably as AAPL heads (and there are a lot) can't wait for the next 'thing' in their pipeline.  MSFT simply isn't at this point... yet.  

I think the 2 trillion market cap is making some think 'how can it get any bigger/better'... I thought the same when it crossed 1 trillion back at the end of '18."
2021-06-04 23:17:04,stocks,Keep apple
2021-06-04 23:22:32,stocks,MSFT is probably the safe bet here.
2021-06-05 03:42:52,stocks,"Any option here on CRM Salesforce? 

Apple 2.2 trillion evaluation has had its stagnation. Only positive news that increase price was the EV news. Otherwise, it’s dropped since that and even after incredible quarterly earnings."
2021-06-04 23:41:10,stocks,"Apple will pop more this year, but long term msft is better"
2021-06-04 23:30:42,stocks,I'm pulling for a Gateway comeback
2021-06-05 00:11:43,stocks,I still like avgo at current prices
2021-06-05 07:37:10,stocks,"I would instead move it to GOOG instead of MSFT.   Google is cheaper, makes more money, and growing faster.

Plus Google has a lot more assets yet to be monetized.

But otherwise still like AAPL more than MSFT.   But really, IMHO, people should be owning all four.  GOOG, AMZN, AAPL and MSFT."
2021-06-05 08:15:16,stocks,"I think both are going to have slower growth post pandemic, simply the size of the companies and how they get revenue...I feel Microsoft might have more solid opportunities to grow..but Apple has a hardcore base that will gladly pay when Apple cuts corners and charges them extra (for example no headphones or chargers) I bet a near (maybe a few years) future move from Apple will be no more hard drive and 100% cloud storage with a monthly payment (but this is speculative on my part)..

I like Microsoft on this because they have more flexibility with income streams..but personally I wouldn’t care to have either in my portfolio, the companies are too big for my portfolio preference.."
2021-06-05 09:01:43,stocks,Goog
2021-06-05 00:44:26,stocks,Lol what? Why? Just because you feel like it? What's the methodology? Oh yea you're just some random nobody thinking you're warren Buffett. Just stick to in dex funds. Wanna share with us your 3k portfolio?
2021-06-05 00:37:49,stocks,"No bias.  MSFT has had a nice run, AAPL has been somewhat stagnant since the split.  Maybe OP is overthinking it a bit, I agree with you that AAPL will see a good run this year.  I wouldn't sell either of them, I've had enough lessons in the guessing game. Just hold, if you like the company why sell any?"
2021-06-05 13:45:02,stocks,"Apple doesn't spend the cash they have on hand whereas Microsoft just bought Nuance for $15 billion so that is also something to consider.

You can also factor in Microsoft's move to a subscription based/focused model and the cloud. Microsoft still has a ton of room to grow in my opinion."
2021-06-05 15:04:04,stocks,Thanks. I agree.  It's really hard too tell the future.  I just have about 10% in AAPL.
2021-06-04 23:42:59,stocks,I'm keeping.  Just thinking of reducing from 10% to 5% and increasing msft to around 10%.
2021-06-04 23:48:49,stocks,That's how I've felt since 1.5 years of investing so far.  But AAPL has done better percentage wise for my account. I even feel LRCX will do better than AAPL going forward.  Not sure of course.
2021-06-05 05:09:40,stocks,I love Salesforce. Expecting that they're going to acquire Monday.com to continuously bring the heat to Microsoft in the office space.
2021-06-05 07:03:43,stocks,long crm for sure
2021-06-04 23:44:36,stocks,That's how I feel.
2021-06-05 02:50:06,stocks,I hope so. What makes you say that though?
2021-06-05 19:51:46,stocks,I upvoted you for the memes
2021-06-04 23:46:25,stocks,"Yeah I haven't lost faith or anything.  I just feel MSFT is a little more stable.  Most likely won't matter much in long run for me anyways. It's not like I have hundreds of thousands in either, but percentage is percentage!"
2021-06-05 15:07:30,stocks,3% dividend also!  Although 3% of maybe $1000 isn't much lol.
2021-06-05 14:58:16,stocks,Thanks.  I've got less in AMZN n GOOGL.  Maybe 3 to 4% each.  No FB though.  I've got LRCX NVDA too.
2021-06-05 14:46:16,stocks,"Maybe I can view them like bonds?  I don't fear losing money with them long term, but maybe 5% yoy growth?  Maybe 10% hopefully!"
2021-06-05 14:44:14,stocks,Yeah I only have I think 4% in GOOGL.
2021-06-05 15:01:21,stocks,"Ahahaahaa.  Try almost 6 figures.  Not a lot I agree, but I'm working on it."
2021-06-05 15:06:30,stocks,I don't think it'll matter either way in the long run. I'm about 50% tech though and thought good idea lighten up.  20% is msft aapl.  Then I have LRCX NVDA ASML etc.
2021-06-05 05:47:34,stocks,"Bad move. You're going to sell a company you like, get hit with taxes, then buy into another company you like with less cash because of the taxes. Your net worth will immediately decrease as an result of this trade. 

It would be different if you didn't like aapl, but if you like them, just hold."
2021-06-05 12:02:22,stocks,Apple is due for some positive movement and they have 100 billion in cash. But in the end you need to trust yourself. Best of luck
2021-06-05 11:21:41,stocks,"Apple will release new products (iphone, earpods) in september for xmas.  It will get some excitement and the stock will pop.  Microsoft has little excitement end of year.  But I like microsoft's diversity long term"
2021-06-05 12:16:43,stocks,Why do you ‘feel’ that? ‘Feel’ is the worst word to hear when discussing investments.
2021-06-05 09:20:41,stocks,I agree. I think just put more contributions into MSFT/others and your Apple % will reduce.
2021-06-05 14:59:33,stocks,Long term shares.  I pay 0% long term gains.
2021-06-05 14:43:21,stocks,Yeah it's just I have 10% in AAPL.  Maybe wouldn't hurt to diversify 5% of it. Sooner or later I'm gonna have to trim it unless other things catch up.
2021-06-05 15:02:17,stocks,How does that work? Long term capital gains isn't zero
2021-06-05 15:00:39,stocks,So your basing this on its stock performance?

2021-06-05 17:13:44,stocks,Well if you can translate what their outlook is into what it might be on the balance sheet and think they will not be growing much...then thats a decent reason to start backing out of a company.
2021-06-05 18:08:59,stocks,"I just listen to various CNBC people and read Motley Fool.  I check a few technicals like earnings growth, pe, forward pe, etc.  

No one knows what the future of any company will be.  If anyone really knew they'd be ultra rich.  The technicals can all line up and a stock can still tank.

I just think 10% may be a little much that's all.  I read somewhere that you shouldn't have more than 5% in any one stock."
2021-06-05 19:40:03,stocks,"Well then sell it for another...or better just don’t add more Apple in case theres some cap gains involved.

That said, while no one knows anything with certainty I think they can make logical decisions that likely provide a better outcome. Apple is continuing to make 13% earnings on avg. plus buying back 5% of their stock. So in theory that should translate into 18% growth and all things being equal 18% increase in stock price. Thats still a great outlook. But not as good as MSFT at 28% with a little over 1% buybacks."
2021-06-05 00:00:00,stocks,"MRNA - When do you take profit vs. hang in for the long haul? I acquired a very modest number of MRNA several months ago. Today it beat its 52 WK high and I’m sitting on a lovely 47% return. In fact, only a certain frowned upon canine coin has yielded a better return for me (yes, I know). So now I’m sitting here pondering whether I cash out now with a very respectable % gain or do I see what’s on the other side of the mountain? 

History is littered with people who sold Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, too soon. I still regret my own sale of 75% of my TSLA at $1k pre-split. But history is also littered with people who held on too long. Whether they were greedy, lazy, or emotionally attached to their holdings, these poor souls could have cashed out at or near the peak but they skied downslope, leaving a pile of cash behind them. 

MRNA is my current dilemma. $206 is great. Does it go to $240 by the end of the year? Does it go to $960 in 10? And if I did sell, what would be a better buy with those gains? 

Honestly, it’s kind of easier to lose money…."

2021-06-04 22:39:04,stocks,"There is a surprisingly simple answer to your dilemma: sell half and keep half.

All investors eventually find themselves in the exact situation you are in now.  They have a nice gain, but aren't sure if the stock will continue to rise.  Like you, many people look at this as an ""either or"" decision.  Either they sell everything or keep everything, but that is not your true range of choices.  You can sell or keep any percentage of the stock you want."

I'm sure there are people who sell their investment too late and lost money. We simply don't know the future, ask yourself why you buy MRNA - if the reason still exists, then hold it."

2021-06-04 23:05:14,stocks,"FYI, Moderna PS = 28, but revenue is projected to increase by a smidge - about 2200% - in FY21, giving the company a foward PE = 4.2.

Dunno if I'd buy it but I sure as hell wouldn't sell it.

(edit: the 2200% is relative to FY20, but the PE=28 is probably based on TTM revenue, which includes Q1 21).

2021-06-04 21:30:30,stocks,"This is literally the question for every investment: when to cash out and when to hold for the long haul. I’ve had my fair share of enormous gains that I held for way too long and they popped, ones I sold early for a big profit and the stock 10x’d after and I still think about the ‘what if’s’ on.

If you feel there is more potential hold, if you feel it’s peaked or want to guarantee those gains sell. Sometimes I just sell the gains if they’ve already far surpassed my original investment and let the surplus ride.

Also think of the advantages of holding to avoid short term capital gains tax vs holding for long and lowering your taxes on the sale."

For me, it's the extreme valuation  (p/e = 83)

Yours is an interesting dilemma.  I'd hold for a bit.. new high is nice, but I think the product, the need, the near term demand make selling now, here look too soon.

If you're still uncomfortable, sell 20%, let it rise and sell another 20% to cover costs. Then hold.

Conversely, if it stops here,  sell the same %% here,  put a stop loss at a 20% drop. Repeat your DD and determine if it's good for a second ride."

2021-06-05 09:31:34,stocks,"A decision to hold is equivalent to a decision to buy. Would you buy more at current valuations? If so hold. If not, sell. If unsure, sell half."
2021-06-04 23:02:31,stocks,Mind if I follow up with this? How does a trailing stop loss work? It triggers an auto sale if the drop hits a certain percent below the high?
2021-06-05 00:56:35,stocks, Stop loss doesn't work during extended hours so if they fail a trial and announce it after hours you will hold it the entire gap down
2021-06-05 15:19:20,stocks,"This is a solid response. I wonder about that combo. It seems like Novavax has shifted their focus to positioning themselves in that pole position. I would be happy if either reach market first. Kinda prefer Novavax because I’m red with them and already black w MRNA.

2021-06-04 23:29:04,stocks,THIS is helpful. Math. I’ve made up my mind. Thank you very much.

2021-06-05 13:50:34,stocks,Inverse this.
2021-06-04 23:42:41,stocks,"Exactly. If the price drops x% from the high, it automatically sells. It’s a way to protect profits. Since you are already up 47%, you could set a trailing stop loss for, say, 10%. If the price drops 10% from the all time high, it triggers a sell. Until a 10% drop happens, if it ever does, you’re along for the ride."
2021-06-05 06:27:44,stocks,That’s why I prefer setting alerts.

2021-06-05 09:33:01,stocks,"I am a long-term investor in SPCE; so we are on the same page, yet I understand that their business model is very risky with many hopeful assumptions built in.  The cash flow required to grow as you state could require a weekly burn of 60 million rather than the current quarterly.  The variable cost of each flight will also be significantly more than the fuel cost.

The other side of the equation is that they will invest billions into this business model and the demand required to be profitable just does not materialize.  I think this possibility is the reason many short the stock."
2021-06-05 09:40:52,stocks,I actually don’t want them to be profitable next year.  I rather them use the funds they have to expand the fleet and scale the business. Which they are doing.

They have to keep up the illusion that they are the future, and that's hard when you are actively making concrete decisions that people can scrutinize daily.

Maintains optionality to get money back at a later point as share issuance compared to dividends

Immediately improves some performance metrics such as EPS (which will likely result in higher executive comp)

Add a charge port on the bottom of the mouse so you can't use it while charging and call it magic mouse 2.  What's so magical about them anyway?  I can go on and on.

2021-06-05 05:23:42,stocks,"They use excess cash to buy Apple shares in the open market from other people who hold on to them. These shares are called “treasury shares” which are then cancelled. So by reducing the total number of shares outstanding, the remaining shareholders own a larger % of the entire company despite holding the same number of shares. 

For example, if a company had 1000 shares outstanding and you own 100, you own 10% of the company. If the company bought back 500 shares, you now own 100/500 = 20% of the company. 

By owning a larger % of the entire company, you have a proportionately larger claim on the cashflows and voting rights of the company. A direct impact on shareholders would be PE compression as EPS will increase due to a smaller denominator of no. of shares outstanding. So the share price of the stock would increase."

I find that hard to believe but I'm sure you have more experience than me.

As a consumer I can only say that the software generally works better, especially third party apps. For instance Discord, the difference between iOS and Android is definitely noticeable.

SPY and any equities you hold are likely to be highly correlated. Now they may rise and fall at different rates, but none the less they will likely fall together.

The saying goes in a bear market all correlations go to one. 

Now I am not against index investing and keeping a good portion of your portfolio in an index fund, but by no means can you treat it like a storage of cash.

The truth is what you're asking for is a highly liquid, risk free, return on money. That just doesn't exist. 

You want a higher return, you take on more risk. 

It's not an answer people like, but it's the truth."

2021-06-05 00:00:00,stocks,"A question about Hedge Fund bankruptcy… Sorry to ask it here, but I wanted a straight and unbiased response.

Everyone sees what happening with AMC recently, and I was interested in knowing about what happens if all of the float is bought up (just like the AMC case) and what happens now that HF’s are not in a position to cover at all.

Even if they attempt to cover at this point, they will pay massive amounts of money for it, and we can reasonably expect them to go bankrupt.

So my question is, why can’t a hedge fund just hold their hands up and go bankrupt on their own accord, especially now in the situation they’re in? And if they do that, then AMC is done if I presume correctly?"

For the record, I don’t hold any AMC or GME, but I’m just interested to learn about the dynamics of what’s happening."

2021-06-04 21:11:57,stocks,"They won't have to pay full price probably, only a better price than bankruptcy court.

I'm not an expert, smooth brain ape.

If you are short AMC and go bankrupt, I expect the price of AMC will go back down a lot.

If you are long AMC at a very high price it might make sense to it out the other guy while it's still mooned.

Spend it or lose it right?"
2021-06-04 22:53:22,stocks,"You are so confused or misinformed.  Why would you think there are insufficient shares to cover?  Today's volume was 337MM and yesterday was just as high.  The last short interest numbers put the total shares short at 94MM.  In the last two days alone there have been enough shares traded to cover all of the shorts 7x over.  This is not the same thing as GME earlier in the year when short interest was over 100%.  AMC short interest was only 21%.

Second they only have to cover if they get margin called.  That only happens when their liability exceeds the value of their account.  They can still sell other things to cover their position.  Unless short positions in AMC is the entirety of their portfolio it is not likely anyone is going to go bankrupt."
2021-06-04 20:40:19,stocks,"There is no law requiring them to cover, so long as they pay the interest. That’s the common misconception."
2021-06-04 20:39:26,stocks,I'm with you OP. I don't own any shares of either and would like to know why they would not be required to cover and why bankruptcy wouldn't be permitted to avoid liability.
2021-06-04 20:57:17,stocks,"You're required to pay your rent or mortgage. You're required to pay your credit card bill.

But what happens if you can't afford it? You're evicted or foreclosed on, you have a collections agency come after you and you get some dings on your credit report.

You can't squeeze blood from a stone. You can't force someone to buy shares on the open market to fulfil a contract if they don't have money to do so. Naked shorting isn't a new phenomenon, and failure to deliver is more common than you think.

Yes, I've read all of the ""DD"" on GME and AMC. I just think it's absurd to think that the prices will go into the millions because ""shorts must cover""."

How do you think this is ultimately going to end for the HF’s?"
2021-06-04 20:48:17,stocks,"Ok, so what’s you’re saying is that these HF’s are going to go on for eternity with paying constant interest? Isn’t that a massive downside for them?

Plus, isn’t a margin call an option? Wouldn’t they be obligated to cover in that event?"
2021-06-04 21:04:11,stocks,"Thanks for your comment, I am with you on the belief that the price won’t reach millions.

So, as you said the HF’s can’t be forced to close their shorts. So on their side, why not just go bankrupt and clear yourself of liability, instead of dragging the whole thing out knowing that it’s probably not possible to fully cover even if they wanted?

Of course, they don’t _have_ to, but why are they still going on paying interest for no good reason and no good result? Isn’t it in their best interests to just go insolvent and call the whole saga to a close?"

2021-06-04 20:51:33,stocks,"To put it simply, margin calls happen when a risk is present, hedges have billions so they have a 10% likelyhood of being margin called (not much risk) and highly unlikely they will be called.

now they can and will hold their shorts so long as it’s cheaper to pay the interest instead of cover, also keeping in mind hedgfunds typically pay anywhere from 0.30% - 3% where as people like you and me pay 10% - 30%.

2021-06-04 21:58:10,stocks,"They can go insolvent but it easier for them to keep shorting, the whole point of shorting is that you make money of stocks that are overpriced and bound to come down. And right now these stocks are super high, and will eventually come down. 

It is a game of patience and they have a much better ability to be patient since they don’t actually need the money they are trading, while the WSBers will eventually have to sell to make any money at all. 

So they may loose money on a few cycles but eventually they will make that money back, if they aren’t already making money on the current cycle.

If we are to talk conspiracies, then I think it is more likely that the shorts are the ones driving the price up, sell short, then wait for it to fizzle and they cover in between the highs, then start to run it up again and go on repeat. And their will be a fresh crop of wanna be millionaires to skim of every few month.

But when you buy a $30 stock for $300, You aren’t the one profiting even if the number on your screen look good. Not until you sell it even higher."

2021-06-04 22:14:29,stocks,Very true :)
2021-06-04 20:56:00,stocks,"I see, so let’s use the example of AMC for now.

Let’s say the price really goes high, and that kind of risk of not being able to cover with the billions that they have materialises. At that point, the HF’s know they’re messed if it comes to that, so can’t they just go bankrupt and clear themselves of responsibility?"

2021-06-04 21:14:53,stocks,"In the case of AMC, most HF’s probably shorted around about $2-4. The price currently sits at $48. That’s a massive loss to them considering the amount of shares they shorted, no?

In effect, it would seem like in order to cover what they shorted they would need to put a massive demand on the stock by trying to re-buy the shares, which would likely increase the price exponentially, which will cost them a massive amount."

2021-06-04 22:57:13,stocks,Where do you get that most HF's shorted around $2-$4?  They have probably been in and out of their positions multiple times since then.  For all you know they could have been in at the peak in Feb at $20.  Also the last short interest number was only 21% and from 5/15.  Most of the shorts could have been covered especially in the last couple days which could be why it had the big run up.  The squeeze may actually already be over.
2021-06-04 21:08:35,stocks,"I see, so in the case of AMC, if all these shorting HF’s declare bankruptcy, what can we realistically expect to happen?

Reddit will probably blow up with apes declaring victory, but after the HF’s go bust, what’s holding up the share price?"
2021-06-05 05:07:06,stocks,"The market would likely see a few percentage points knocked off, because hedge funds tend to own sizable quantities of other stocks, so if they go bankrupt, they’ll have to sell everything to meet investor redemptions."
2021-06-04 21:10:00,stocks,"Most of the market would plummet if that happens, they would liquidate every holding and the entire market would crash. But again, not likely, they would be bailed out before that happened"

It was set to expire EoD but has yet to go away and my “positions” shows they are mine and what I have lost so far today. Little bit confused as to if they are mine or not because the “cash buying power” has not changed what so ever. Limit order says “filled” next to it but don’t actually know if they are mine. Little confused on what’s actually going on and when it’ll actually drop the Limit order from fulfilling/trying to since it was only supposed to execute today. Thanks everyone.

so you now have 1.21.

at year 3, your initial investment still appreciates 10% but so does your interest (.21)...

2021-06-04 23:25:43,stocks,"Hi friend, I know you say you've figured out your issues but I'll just add this:

As one person pointed out, stocks do not compound \*interest\* the way a bank account does.  Remember the principle of a savings account is risk-free, and the savings account grows only by adding interest to the principle.

For stocks, money doesn't compound.  You hold the stock and the changing value of the company determines the return on your investment.  You may or may not get a dividend and have that reinvested.  But the fact that you got a dividend doesn't ensure that your account is worth more.  It's just a payment.

All that being said, we want to be able to compare the return on different types of investments.  So we frequently use a mathematical formula to calculate the time-averaged rat of return on stocks.  That value is called ""Cagger"" or Compound Annual Growth Rate.  It sounds simple but if your stock grew 70% in 7yrs, even if it grew at a perfectly smooth rate, it didn't grow 10% per year - it actually grew at 8% per year.  In fact if your stock grew 10% each year, it would be up 100% in 7yrs."
2021-06-05 02:28:07,stocks,"You absolutely do not need to sell stocks and repurchase to experience the effects of compounding.  Compounding is the effect of growth on your investment, and the effect of growth on reinvested dividends or additional out-of-pocket investment.

For example you buy a stock at $100, and hold it for 10 years.  At the end of 10 years you sell it for $500.  Your investment compounded it's value over the years.  In the real world it doesn't happen smoothly, but we can calculate its *averaged* compounding growth rate.  Let's figure out how your investment compounded.

CAGR=(Ve/Vb)^(1/n) - 1

where:

CAGR = Compounded Annual Growth Rate

Ve=Ending value

Vb=Beginning value

n=Number of years

So, (500/100)^(1/10) - 1 = .174619, or a compounded annually growth rate of 17.4619%.

Now, we can also figure out how your money would grow at different compounding rates.  The future value (FV).  You are starting out with $1,000 and you are not touching it.  You are getting a compounded rate of return of 6%.  How much is it worth in 10 years?

FV=I×(1+R)^T

where:

I = Investment amount

R = Interest rate

T = Number of years

​
**1000 x (1 + 0.06)^10 = 1,790.85**

What about 9%?

**1000 x (1 + 0.09)^10 = 2,367.36**

How about 6% over 30 years?

**1000 x (1 + 0.06)^30 = 5,743.49**

Great!  However, what if you are investing more out-of-pocket money or reinvesting dividends?  We can figure it out!... with Excel or a web based calculator because I'm not typing out all out!  I'll foul it up. 😆

In Excel you can use the FV formula and there are plenty of online calculators.  401k calculators do exactly this.  Just plug in your starting value, how much you plan to add each year (or each month), a percent growth rate, and the number of years.  You can see how your money can grow through compounding.

One last example.  Stocks go up and down.  Let's say you buy a stock at $100.00 on Dec 30th.  Every year on Dec 30th you check it.

Year 1 its price goes up to $110.00. +10% YoY.

Year 2 it goes up to $154.00. +40% YoY.

Year 3 it goes down to $84.70. -45% YoY.

Year 4 it goes back up to $160.93. +90 YoY.

Year 5 its price reaches $201.16. +25% YoY.


You sell it.  Your compounded annually growth rate over 5 years was ~15%."
2021-06-05 00:21:16,stocks,"If you're doing daily trades, you can take advantage of compounding. For example, let's say that you hop in a particular stock, on a particular day, and you make a quick 3 percent. Then you take all that money, and jump into something else, and make another 3 percent. That first 3 percent compounded. You can do that every single day, if you were winning every single day. But, if you buy a stock, and just hold it long term, you don't really get the true nature of the compounding effect. You'd have to be more of a swing trader. Taking advantage of swings in prices by buying and selling and hoping to come out on the plus side so that you can continue the compounding"
2021-06-05 07:43:31,stocks,Thanks a lot! I’m noting this down :)
2021-06-04 20:33:26,stocks,How old are you?
2021-06-04 20:10:56,stocks,"Yes, that percentage is called CAGR (compound annual growth rate), it is a simple formula.

If a stock went from 10 to 100 in 10 years, then using the initial value, final value and number of years, you can calculate the % value.

This is the % every news outlet will use to tell historical annual returns and compounding.

You personally don't have to do anything expect buy and hold to get that rate."
2021-06-05 01:38:37,stocks,"When you look at equity markets long term growth, it’s close to 10% annually. You can’t assume that it will do that every year but as long as you buy some every year, over the long term your investment will grow. But say it’s 10% every year. What that means is that your stocks will on average grow 10% every year. That stock’s “value surplus” as you mention is indeed “automatically re-invested” if you don’t sell it. Imagine 1 share of AAPL which cost you say $100 a few months back. Next year, it grows 10%, so that’s now $110 in your portfolio. What happens when Apple grows another 10%? That $110 becomes $121 (not $120). Where does that extra $1 come from? From the higher starting point of $110 and not from your original $100 invested. Your earning has compounded. Then it goes on and on."
2021-06-05 02:13:21,stocks,This is a really odd way of thinking about compounding to me. It doesn't really say much about losses--and losses can be compounded too with this reasoning.
2021-06-05 02:42:08,stocks,"While this is a time consuming activity that would compound your money, it is incorrect to say holding long term does not ""get the true nature of compounding"".

This also ignores (at least in the States) the pitfalls of short-term capital gains, fees, and stock dips.  The majority of day traders do worse than the market over the long-term..."
2021-06-05 08:44:51,stocks,"Really cool trick is **""the rule of 72""**.  Wanna know how long it takes to double your investment at a set rate of return?  Divide 72 by that rate for a rough estimate.  For example, a 6% compounded rate of return.

**72/6 = 12.**

Every 12 years the investment doubles.  So, $1000.00 at 6% in 24 years will double twice and be worth $4000.00.  In the first 12 years, you would have $2000.00.  Another 12 years, the $2000.00 becomes $4000.00.

You can also do the inverse.  What rate of return do you need to double your money in 7 years?

**72/7 = ~10.29**

10.29% compounded rate of return will double your money every 7 years.  In 21 years, your investment doubles 3 times.  $1000.00 grows to $8000.00."
2021-06-04 20:02:08,stocks,You answer is confusing. How are you compounding if not reinvesting? There are many stocks and ETFs especially REITs that have 8% or better dividends.
2021-06-04 21:02:34,stocks,"Dividends compound by letting you purchase more shares, however companies that have dividends tend to have less growth. I guess pure growth stocks could be considered compounding, but your overall shares will never increase (barring a stock split or you adding more money). However if you expect a certain percentage of growth each year, it should have the same effect. If you invest 1000, and gain 10% the first year you have 1100. If you get 10% again the next year, you are getting 10% of the 1100 you hold, not the 1000 you initially invested."
2021-06-05 02:10:45,stocks,This is earnings yield growth most likely. Companies can definitely increase that but it is different and perhaps a bit more ephemeral than straight dividend reinvesting.

2021-06-05 00:00:00,stocks,"Joann Fabrics - Short DD. I am a bull for 'JOAN' Ladies and Gents, 

I have modified my investing approach and am now a value investor. My goal is to always buy good companies at bargain prices. 

This is my short DD for ticker symbol “JOAN”, the underlying company is Joann Fabrics. 

This company recently went public again after a ten year hiatus where they were taken private. Currently they have approximately ⅓ of the shares outstanding available for purchase to the public. The remaining ⅔ is owned by Leonard Green & Partners which was the firm that took them private about a decade ago. The ⅔ of shares are currently in lock-up and will remain in lock-up until September (180 days after IPO). 

Revenues 

2019 - $2.314 Billion / 2020 - $2.241 Billion / 2021 - $2.762 Billion 

Net Income 

2019 - $35.3 Million / 2020 - \*(546.6 million) \*/ 2021 - 212.3 Million

A major driver of the negative profit in 2020 was due to 486.8 million goodwill and impairment charge. From the 10-K, “We did record impairment charges of 486.8 million in fiscal 2020, which were predominantly the result of negative total comparable sales and declining margins, driven primarily by the incremental U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports, along with a weaker than expected peak selling season” Ref. (1) 

Now, you may see the 2020 numbers and say, well that seems terrible. You’d be right. 

However, fiscal 2021 was a BLOWOUT year for them. Why? Well, COVID of course, that was the year that all were at home and couldn’t do anything out in town. Because of this they are currently trading at a 2.81 TTM P/E. Now of course, I do not believe they will generate as much top and bottom line in fiscal 2022. However, they have had a lot of favorable trends go their way and likely will continue into the future. Based on the analysts that currently report on JOAN they see it trading at \~5.8 forward P/E which essentially means they think profit will be about half as much as it was last year. That is fair that it will be less, but HALF?

Let’s take a look at their most recent quarterly results which posted yesterday (Q1 Fiscal 2022) 

Net Sales - 574 million vs. 499.4 million in the year prior. 

Net income - 15.1 million vs. (23.6 million) in the year prior.

EPS of $0.39…. Did I forget to mention Q1 and Q2 are traditionally their worst performing quarters? If we assume this EPS sticks for the next four quarters it is currently trading at \~11 FWD P/E. That would also be ridiculously stupid to do, considering net income was 47.7 Million in Q3 ‘fiscal 2021 and 38.3 million in Q4 ‘fiscal 2021.

Now the argument could definitely be made that stimulus and covid played a one-time role in some of these revenues and profits. That would be impossible to calculate so I personally always like to have a margin of safety which is also why I think analysts predicted a forward P/E of about twice as much as it currently trades for on a TTM. So based on that, I will just continue the argument on the \~5.8 Forward P/E. 

Analysts were predicting earnings of $0.18 per share, turns out Joann Fabrics destroyed that and made over double. 

If you take a look at ref (3) which is the highlights from the earnings report or listen to the earnings call on their investor relations page on the website it highlights some significant growth opportunities and long-term trends they see. I will just speak about a few and feel free to check out the others in your own additional DD. 

The arts & crafts business has been reinvigorated because of covid, and it’s here to stay. Look at etsy for example, there are hundreds of thousands of arts and crafts items being crafted every day by people like you and me. (Long term growth potential)

The gross margin improved by 23.1% (that is \*\*\*\*ing huge!) They are able to generate higher tickets, more often. The omni-channel growth was 186% over the past two years (only represents 13% of sales as of now). 

I feel like I’d just be retyping the entire earnings transcript trying to say why this company is going to do phenomenally well in the coming years.

Comparatively, Michaels was taken private in November of last year in a 5 billion dollar deal, which would be one of the closest competitors based off this deal it would value Joann at about $40 or a valuation of 1.8 billion (based off of sales). However, Joann products have higher margins and personally I believe Joann has better growth prospect stories, in store sewing lessons, revamping the Joann consumer experience in new look stores (only a few stores are being re-done a year). 

Did I mention the dividend…? It’s not much, but $0.40/year or $0.10/quarter. Not bad, currently a yield of a little over 2% as of today’s stock price \~$16 ish. 

Some negative things about Joann - They do have \~700 M in long-term debt, all of the IPO money they received went directly to paying down debt and one of their goals this year is to continue to reduce leverage and expect to reach \~650 M in long-term debt by the end of the fiscal year. (I see this as a positive). The CEO clearly has a long-term plan on how this debt will be repaid. 

Headwinds - Shipping cost has been rising significantly due to the economy reopening, this will likely play a key role in margins in the coming quarters. Next quarter will also be the worst of the year on a traditional basis, due to them having to prepare product wise for Q3 and Q4 which traditionally are the best quarters. 

My Bull Thesis - This company is trading at 2.81 TTM P/E, these “expert” analysts think it’s at a 5.8 forward P/E, which I think they are low-balling JOAN, but let’s say they are right. The current market average for P/E is 36.8 and traditional average is 19.6. This is a smaller company and should be trading at a discount compared to a bigger obvious great company like Apple or Johnson and Johnson which both have P/E’s of about 27-29. However, should it be trading \~5-6X cheaper!? I would not be typing this if I thought that was the case. This company has several growth prospects in the future and seems to be run by a solid team that has growth in mind. I think this company should be trading at a forward P/E or TTM P/E (whichever is higher) of about 15 which would lead me to my price target of $44.00. That is assuming I believe the analyst FWD P/E which I think it is low balling. I feel comfortable buying this stock below $30 and I have a personal price target of $50.00

Disclaimer - I am a BULL for JOAN, I do own 2000 shares at an avg price of $14.60. I also have some November calls. 

Now, while I obviously want any of you reading this to look into the company and invest if you think it’s a value play. I do fundamentally believe in this company and their future. My plan is to hold for several years, unless the story somehow goes sour, I do not see that happening in the near-term. If the stock some-how reached above $70 I would likely sell, if it reached above $55 (10% above my own price target) I would likely reduce my position in half. 

\--- I welcome any feedback, I do recognize I have a bias towards this company. If I didn’t, I probably wouldn’t invest in it. 

I hope you find this at least useful in determining whether or not to do your own DD into the company.

2021-06-05 01:28:40,stocks,"I think you’re missing the biggest headwind, namely the end of COVID.

The company has thrived together with the meteoric rise of online marketplaces like ETSY. People bought arts and crafts to pass the time at home, create masks and items to sell online, etc. 

Now that reopenings are well underway, is it realistic to think that comparables for these companies will be the same or better? Personally I don’t think so (and expect a reversion closer to 2018-2020 results).

Also, given the low operating margins and high assets (low return on assets) and high debt, I don’t see why they should command the type of P/E ratio you expect. You would be better off comparing the ratio to their peers (e.g. retail craft stores), not to companies like Apple."

At $60, I bought a $50put.
At $49, I bought a $52call.

I then proceeded to watched the stock drop to around $35... my put was well ITM. Did I close my put and take around 60% profit? No... I got greedy, waiting for $30.

I then proceeded to watch it go to $67. Did I close my call and profit around 60%? No... I got greedy/dumb and wanted it to hit 69 or 70.

It has now sat around 51 all day and where I could've basically doubled my money yesterday.... my call and my put has now expired worthless.

Luckily, this is only the 3rd option I've ever traded and I'm taking this as a valuable learning experience. Thankfully while the loss isn't great, it's only about 2% of my portfolio so I'll be okay.

2021-06-05 00:00:00,stocks,"GTHX a DD; note this DD is about 3 months old, no changes have been made for events of the past 3 months G1 Theraputics

History:

G1 Theraputics is a newer drug company that develops and commercializes various therapies primarily relating to the treatment of cancer and cancer related symptoms. It was founded in 2008 and went public in May 2017.  

G1 has three main drub candidates; lerociclib, rintodestrant and trilaciclib; plus one newer as yet unnamed drug. 

Lerociclib (a drug with no current assignable value, but possible future payments):

The first drug candidate, lerociclib is being tested for multiple possible uses, however G1 has entered into agreements with EQRx, Inc and Genor Biopharma Co. Inc, such that these companies with test and commercialize the drug. Genor Biopharma Co. Inc has rights to commercialize this drug in the Asia Pacific region, including Japan; while EQRx Inc has rights to the rest of the world, including the USA. In return for ceding the testing and commercialization of lerociclib, G1 received payments of 26 million and could receive up to $330 million in additional milestone payments in the future. 

It is unclear at this stage in G1 will ever receive future payments for this drug, it is unclear when these payments might occur, and furthermore the amount of money under consideration ($330 million) is fairly small when compared to the possible funds from G1's other drug candidates.  However, the companies that purchased the rights to the drug did already pay 26 million for those rights, so its likely they see significant possible future value in the drug.

Thus, taking all these pieces of info into account, this report assigns this drug a fairly conservative future value of 20-30% of the possible future payments, or 67 to 133 million dollars. This payment must be discounted as it may not start for 3-5 years and would likely continue over several years. So, if this possible future revenue is discounted by 8% for 8 years (0.54 multiplier) this gives a current value to G1 of 36 to 72 million dollars.


Rintodestrant (G1's 2nd drug, some possible future value):

With regards to the 2nd drug candidate, rintodestrant, G1 is currently testing this drug for use in patients with  ER+ or HER2- breast cancer. Beast cancer accounts for about 30% of all cancers in females, in the USA.  About 65% of breast cancer is ER+, which means that estrogen mistakenly signals the cancer to grow and sometimes even protects the cancer from the body's own immune system. To combat this there are several possible treatments but for many of the cancers, a class of drugs called SERD's has proven to be very effective often when other treatments fail.  SERD's promote ER degradation which can have many anti-tumor effects, again primarily in use with cancers that have shown a resistance to other drugs.

Currently only one SERD, fluvestrant (a competing drug sold by AstraZeneca) is approved for use though several other SERD's, including the G1 candidate, rintodestrant, are being tested.  G1 began a phase I test of rintodestrant in 2018 and presented data from this test in 2019 and 2020. Based on the results of the phase I test, rintodestrant is likely (though as yet, not proven) to be more potent in binding and degrading ER, which would lead to faster and more complete degradation of tumors.  Additionally, rintodestrant has been observed to have a lower incidence of adverse effects, no severe side effects as well as no observed toxicity or bradycardia (bradycardia refers to an abnormally lowered heart rate). Furthermore, rintodestrant is easier to administer as it can be given orally (fluvestrant is administered by injection).

Based on the successful phase I results, G1 is now conducting a phase II trial of rintodestrant when used in combination with another drug, Palbociclib.   Palbociclib is a drug developed by Pfizer and the trial is of course being conducted with agreement from Pfizer.  The results of this trial should be made public in the 2nd quarter of 2021 ie within a few months.

Regarding assessment of the current value of rintodestrant, there are several problems.  First off, there is a competing drug, fluvestrant, currently being used and other competing drugs currently being tested. While rintodestrant appears to have various advantages over fluvestrant, the main possible advantage would be that its is more potent and though rintodestrant does appear to be more potent (based on the completed phase I trial), this has yet to be fully proven. Additionally further testing of rintodestrant will take several more years and finally, the current testing of rintodestrant is for use in combination with another drug, Palbociclib, and its unclear how revenue would be shared between these 2 drugs if any revenue ever occurs.

The current drug being used in these cases of breast cancer, fluvestrant, had 2020 worldwide sales of 580 million.  In a best case scenario, rintodestrant would take over most of these sales, and these sales have room to grow. However, even in the best case this would not occur for 3-5 years or more, and much of the sales would likely still go to Pfizer if their drug, palbociclib, was used in combination with rintodestrant.  

It seems likely that rintodestrant is a more potent drug than fluvestrant (based on the phase I trial) and also seems likely that rintodestrant has no major side effects and fewer side effects than fluvestrant. It thus seems fairly likely that rintodestrant would eventually replace fluvestrant in large part if not completely, if no additional drugs show up that are even more potent than rintodestrant.

Thus I am estimating an optimistic assessment of the future income stream for this drug (if there ever is one) at about 350 million per year starting in 3-5 years. This represents the current revenue stream (with room to grow),  but discounted for the possibility that the income is shared to some degree with Pfizer.  I am further estimating the likelihood that G1 is able to realize this income stream at about 30% (of course there is also a strong possibility they will realize a lesser amount of income).  This 30% represents the chance that rintodestrant is more effective than fluvestrant (it probably is), is well received and able to mostly or partially replace fluvestrant (it probably will, if it is proven to be a better drug), and finally that no competing drugs quickly emerge that are still more effective than rintodestrant (unlikely, but who knows).

Thus, 30% of 350 million means a expected future income stream of about 105 million, starting in 3-5 years or more, but of course, taking some years for the income stream to reach full strength even if everything goes well.  Discounting the income stream at 8% for 6 years (0.63 multiplier) leads to a present value of the income stream of about 66 million, which equates to a current value to G1 of between 133 million and 200 million (assuming a revenue multiplier of 2 to 3).

Trilaciclib (G1's third drug which has far higher potential)

Though G1 has a few other possible drug candidates (one in particular) they are considering, its difficult to assign any value to these currently untested drugs. Thus, G1's third and final drug of note is Trilaciclib. 

Trilaciclib has been tested and continues to be tested as a drug to be used to reduce myelosuppression (ie protecting the bone marrow which can be greatly suppressed by chemo) in patients receiving chemotherapy to combat diagnosed cancers in the body.  Trilaciclib has already been fully tested (thru phase 3) and proven to be effective in reducing myelosuppression in SCLC (small cell lung cancer) patients. Based on this SCLC testing, G1 has received from the FDA a positive PDUFA decision on February 21, 2021 (3 weeks ago).  This means that patients receiving chemotherapy treatment for SCLC can now receive Trilciclib (which is marketed under the tradename Cosela) as part of their treatment.

Regarding the positive effects of triciclib as proved through testing, by protecting the bone marrow from chemotherapy, triciclib reduces the rate of hematologic adverse events including neutropenia (a condition caused by a reduction in certain types of white blood cells which in turn reduces the body's ability to fight infection), anemia (reduction of red blood cells), and thrombocytopenia (reduction of platelets in the blood).  This means patients can receive longer duration chemotherapy treatments and often still have fewer side effects. Also, the immune system functions better than chemotherapy without triciclib and thus the body's own immune system is sometimes better able to help combat the invasive cancer and its effects.  Also, the reduction of chemotherapy side effects equates to generally shorter hospital stays with fewer problems which can save considerable money for the patients and insurance providers.

To see how widely used triciclib would likely be, G1 interviewed prescribers and found that 77% were extremely enthusiastic, very enthusiastic, or somewhat enthusiastic about the possibility of using triciclib with their patients.  

In their testing, G1 found that patients living with SCLC and receiving Cosela took 100% to 200% longer to report adverse symptoms including extreme fatigue (7 months with Cosela versus 2.3 months with a placebo), tested anemia (7.2 months with Cosela versus 3.8 months with a placebo) and overall functional well being (7.6 months with Cosela versus 3.8 months with a placebo).

Finally, the average treatment cost for a patient with chemotherapy who does not experience a grade 3/4 hematological event is a whopping $67,800; while the cost with a grade 3/4 event is approximately $90,100 (with Thrombocytopenia), $96,000 (with Anemia) and $131,000 (with neutropenia).  Thus, the helpful effects of Cosela might be such that the insurance companies would be happy to pay $8500 (the approximate cost each cycle of chemo) for the Cosela treatment to hopefully greatly reduce the average treatment cost and the incidence of a grade 3/4 hematological event which carries even greater costs which are enumerated above.

Regarding the approved SCLC treatment for triciclib and the income G1 can expect from it.  Approximately 30,000 patients are diagnosed with SCLC every year and of this number about 22,000 receive chemotherapy treatment. Patients who receive chemotherapy need an average of 4 cycles of chemotherapy treatment.  Cosela costs $1417 per vial, but patients require 2 vials per dose, 3 doses per chemotherapy cycle, and 4 chemotherapy cycles, on average. Thus, the total cost is $8502 for the average patient for one cycle of chemotherapy, which equates to $34,008 total average cost (with the average 4 cycles of chemo), per patient. With about 22,000 people being treated for SCLC, this equates to a potential income stream of about 770 million per year (this assumes most SCLC patients will eventually be using Triciclib which is what G1 appears to be projecting or at least hoping will come to pass).  This, in turn, equates to an approximate value to G1 of between 1.54 billion to 2.31 billion assuming a revenue to value multiplier from 2 to 3 (which might be a very conservative multiplier considering the drug is approved and sales have commenced).

In addition to approval for use in patients with SCLC, G1 is now testing, or has announced testing, for triciclib with patients of several other types of cancer including first line colorectal cancer, triple negative breast cancer, neoadjuvant breast cancer, bladder cancer, and non small cell lung cancer. Some of these tests are well underway, some are recently started and some have been approved but not yet started.  

Though G1 has to test its drug on each type of cancer seperately, the mechanism by which triciclib protects the bone marrow is the same regardless of the type of cancer and for almost all types of cancer (and all types that G1 is currently testing) the drug functions in a completely different part of the body (the bone marrow) as where the cancer is located. Thus, if triciclib works well for SCLC cancer, then it is likely it has approximately the same effects and symptoms as with other types of cancer, with the exception of cancer which is specifically located in the red bone marrow - a small subset of all cancer types.

Furthermore, since G1 has already received approval for triciclib with one type of cancer, testing on cancers in other parts of the body can be somewhat sped up as some of the results/ information from the SCLC testing can be easily applied to testing for other types of cancer. Thus, so long as G1 tests carefully and receives no unexpected results (again they know what the results will probably be from the SCLC testing), it will probably be easier to get future approvals for use with other types of cancer.  Essentially G1 has to simply run similar trials to what they ran for SCLC and prove that they get similar results, but its already expected that this will be the case since the functioning of the drug should have nothing to do with the type of cancer being tested (so long as the cancer is not in the bone marrow, where the drug functions).

Currently, G1 is in phase 3 testing for one type of cancer (colorectal).  They have recently begun or will soon begin (within the next 3 months) two separate phase 3 tests for 2 types of breast cancer. They are in phase 2 testing for an additional type of breast cancer, and they recently began or will soon begin phase 2 testing for bladder cancer and Non-SCLC lung cancer.  Several other studies, for more types of cancer are planned for 2021.  Though some of these studies (at least the one for colorectal cancer) will likely complete in 2021, drug approval and thus revenue from these studies may not begin until 2022, but all of these studies may be completed and approved within 3 years, possibly less.

In aggregate these trials that are underway or soon to be underway are for cancers diagnosed far more frequently than SCLC, with patients of these types of cancers receive chemo at the rate of about 470k per year, while SCLC patients receive chemo at a rate of about 22k per year.  However, its not clear that all patients receiving treatment for these cancers would qualify for treatment via triciclib and other problems could emerge so to be safe it would be best to ut this number by about 1/3rd, so 313 thousand patients per year. Thus, the potential revenue stream from these other types of cancer, combined would be about 313.33/22 = 14.24 times as large as the potential revenue stream from SCLC alone. This could (using the same numbers as for SCLC) eventually amount to income of 10.96 billion per year which would in turn equate to a value to G1 of between 21.92 and 32.88 billion.  

Finally, people in other parts of the world also get cancer, and G1 has many patents and several agreements with other companies for these companies to commercialize triciclib in other parts of the world, though G1 themselves still have the rights for most of the world, outside the USA.  It will likely be years before triciclib reaches much of the rest of the world, in fact it will be years before triciclib is accepted for most types of cancer in the USA, assuming this approval even comes.  Still, there is huge potential for this drug outside the USA, as well.


Other G1 Data

Looking at other data beyond G1's current drugs, G1 had 207.3 million cash on hand at the beginning of 2021 and said that they expected their cash on hand to last them through 2022. Of course, if triciclib sales are well underway for SCLC by the end of 2021 then they may never need to raise additional cash.  G1 has also raised some licensing revenue in 2021 and this would further reduce chances they need to raise additional cash, down the road. Because the entire 207.3 million will likely be used to fund future drug testing, no credit will be given for it in this analysis of the value of G1, but this does mean there may be no concern about G1 having to raise more money and dilute there stock in the future.

One other interesting item of note regarding G1.  Some of the earlier founders of the company have moved on to pursue other goals and the whole process of getting their first drug approved has taken years (G1 was founded in 2008, and went public in 2017). Thus G1 may be open to a takeover from a larger drug company, though G1 must realize the vast potential of triciclib. So, there is a chance that G1 could be taken over by a larger drug company, though G1 shareholders might actually be better served if that never happened, possibly making far more money by simply holding on and waiting for the revenue from triciclib to start arriving.


Valuation Summary

So, in summary, G1 has an estimated value of $169 million to $272 million from lerociclib and rintodestrant.  They have an estimate value of 1.54 billion to 2.31 billion from the approved use of their primary drug, triciclib, though sales of this drug just started so it make take a year, or so, for this revenue to show up.  

However G1 has future potential future value of between 21.92 and 32.88 billion from the additional currently underway tests for triciclib, though they probably won't receive any additional revenue from these other types of cancer for a year, possibly more, and won't realize this entire revenue stream for 3 years, possibly more.  They have even more potential revenue from still more testing of their drug with other types of cancer and from commercialization of their drug overseas.

G1 has a current share price of $20.43 and a current market cap of $857 million.  Assuming a 1 year value of 1.7 billion to 2.58 billion (the estimated current value for lerociclib, rintodestrant plus revenue from the SCLC approval for triciclib at a multiplier of 2 to 3), this computes to a current stock value of about $40.50 to 61.50, within about a year (as the revenue for use of triciclib with SCLC starts coming in).  So, about a 98% to 201% return in 1 year. 

However, if all current triciclib tests go well and everything moves along without problem, then G1 may be able to grow triciclib's revenue such that their stock value is from 21.92 and 32.88 billion in 5 to 7 years (assuming about 3-4 years to complete all testing and an additional 2-3 years for revenue to reach its full potential).  Additional revenue from overseas sales is possible but that would just be icing on the cake and its difficult to make an educated guess at what that revenue might be within 5 to 7 years. This gives G1's stock an estimated 5 to 7 year value of about 25.6 to 38.4 times its current value (857 market cap divided by estimated future stock value).  

This last number may actually be conservative, but there are also quite a few things that can go wrong in 5 to 7 years.  Also, there is a decent chance the company will be taken over which would mean an excellent short term return, but nowhere close to a 25.6 to 38.4 bagger.

Possible Near and Distant Catalyst to G1's stock price going up.

At any time they could be taken over by a larger company that sees potential in their Triciclib drug (and other drugs to a lesser extent).  Longer term (1 year) they should see revenue growth from their one approval for Triciclib. Down the road (probably 5 to 7 years) they may get approval for Triciclib for many other types of Cancer and could see massive revenue from this which could cause their stock to go up many times over its current price.

There are risks to this investment as with any other and there will be up's and down's and its not clear if any price movement will occur for as much as 9 months, or more, but I personally think this stock will eventually rise to many times its current valuation, if everything goes well.  You do need a 5-7 year time horizon (possibly more) for this one, and even then its a risk.

While I’m still learning, I figured I need to use a few more platforms for my needs. I like M1 because of the no fees and fractional share option but I dislike that there’s only 1 trading window (2 with M1+). I didn’t realize M1 is more for long term use until this week with AMC.

Anyways, I’m thinking of starting on another platform for any short-term trades I want to make. I read to stay away from robinhood and webull. I use webull to read charts at the moment but not to trade. I also read Fidelity is more for long term use as well. I’m just looking for a platform I’m able to day trade with no cost (or little) while I learn and also something I’m able to use on my phone. Any recommendations or advice? Thank you!"

My friend who I got into stocks with started using this app so I decided to use this rather than robinhood. M1 uses pies so I can split my $100 into different fractional shares and manage as needed. When I was reading about it, it has an auto-invest feature (which I have never used) that pretty much reinvest your money into other shares as needed (I think, maybe someone can correct me if I’m wrong). The only thing I do dislike about this app which I’m sure is common with other platforms is that there’s only 1 trading window. I wanted to sell my AMC when it hit $64 but couldn’t sell til next day when market open so I took a hit (was still profitable)"

2021-06-05 00:00:00,stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, June 4, 2021 **PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, June 4, 2021**

Stocks rose today as investors digested the May Job Report, which showed non-farm payrolls rise by less than expected for the second straight month. Market participants seem to be interpreting the back-to-back miss in job gains for two consecutive months as meaning the Federal Reserve will keep the current accommodative monetary policy in place until the labor market shows robust signs of improvement.

The Labor Department’s May Job Report showed the economy gained 559,000 non-farm payrolls, a substantial increase compared to April but still below estimates of 650,000. For months, the Federal Reserve has consistently reiterated it wants to see a “string” of strong labor reports, like the one in March, before policy adjustments are seriously considered. This is why technology and growth stocks, which would be affected the most by potential adjustments in policy, outperformed today. Former Chase Chief Economist Anthony Chan said, “What I see here is somewhat of a ‘goldilocks’ overall economy. I see that employment is increasing. With regard to the reason why the market is excited, it's because it's telling us that the economy is not blistering hot, that it's actually going to be opening up pretty gradually. I think that's important."" 

Recent economic data has been good overall. A stronger-than-expected ADP private payrolls report and weekly jobless claims report released Thursday each underscored firming rehiring trends across the economy, with a smaller share of individuals becoming newly unemployed for pandemic-related reasons. Another wave of vaccinations has taken place, reopenings have picked up, and businesses have been scrambling to bring back workers to keep pace with surging demand. 

Federal Reserve Bank of New York President John Williams said that the economy was ""still quite a ways off from maintaining the substantial further progress we’re really looking for in terms of adjustments to our asset purchase program.""

**Highlights**

* Marqeta Inc. (MQ), plans on IPOing soon at a valuation of $12 billion offers card-issuing technology that lets businesses build out these functions. The company’s largest client is Square (SQ), which accounted for roughly 70% of revenue last year.
* Square (SQ) is considering making a hardware wallet for bitcoin, CEO Jack Dorsey, said in a tweet. (Jack Dorsey is also the CEO and co-founder of Twitter)
* GE CEO Larry Culp says the deal to combine its jet-leasing unit and GE Capital Aviation Services with rival AerCap (AER) remains on track to close later this year or early next year. 
* Twitter (TWTR) on Thursday said it will roll out a new subscription product initially in Australia and Canada called Twitter Blue, which will let paying users edit their tweets before posting and change the color theme of their app. Twitter has recently been making big pushes trying to raise revenue
* Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) is moving ahead with $12 billion plans to build a new semiconductor factory in Arizona. The US government has been aggressively pursuing semiconductor companies for investments, looking to secure its supply of semiconductors. Intel (INTC) also recently showed plans to also build new factories in Arizona. 
* Sorry, no price target upgrades today"

I know, it is not advised to sell but isn't it logical to take unrealistic gains when you have them? Not unrealistic for Google probably, but in general 40% gain in half a year almost always beats the market. Is it sensible to take money out and invest in a beat down stock like Apple? AAPL had hardly moved since a few months and looks set to take off any day now. I'm aware of warnings against timing the market, but I don't feel like waiting for Google to eventually be just a 20% gain at end of year makes sense."

Oh and that reminds me, they have YOUTUBE, ever heard of it?  Generates billions of hours of content for FREE.  It will be bigger than Netflix, and it's sure of a hell more profitable.

2021-06-04 23:21:17,stocks,"So there's no real way to answer this, other than to give you 3 examples from my own trading experience.

1) I first got into trading for part of the tech boom (2016-2019). Didn't know anything other than tech was hot, ""MAGA"" was starting out (I'm not a trumper nor republican, let's just get that clear), so as a joke I told my broker I was going all MAGA on my account - Make this Account Great Again. Bought even dollar values of Microsoft, Apple, Google, and AMD. Let it sit for 3 years, made ~30k from 45k seed money. Took out the 30k in February 2020 because I was buying a new-to-me truck and wanted a free truck, or at least a market-paid truck.

When did I take the money out? When I wanted a large dollar item and didn't want a payment.

2) Using the same 45k seed money I decided to try out writing options. Couldn't have picked a worse time to play around with a new strategy since the market after March 23, 2020 exploded upward and buy-and-hold strategies made a killing. Anyway, I digress. Got familiar enough with options trading that I could write calls and/or puts on held stocks or cash capital to make money without having to really worry about having to ever sell my initial stock holdings (meaning, the difference between ""1"" and ""2"" is if/when I take out money from ""2"" I'll still have the initial number of shares of stock to keep using as seed to make more money and only pull out gains made from options, where in ""1"" I had to sell some stock to cash out for my truck). I like this strategy better since once you know the ins and outs you can make fairly consistent weekly money.

When will I take the money out? Same situation as in ""1"", but I'll still have all my original shares to keep using as ""seed money"". I've already made enough that my jet ski is now considered ""free"" as I made back in premiums what I took out to buy it initially. 

3) In one part of one of my 401k accounts I have the ability to write covered calls only, no puts and no exotic option strategies. This is nice because I can just hold stocks I want to hold long term for the next 20-30 years and write CCs on them to make extra money on the side of stocks going up, and use that option premium gained to buy more stock, and use that stock to write even more CCs to make even more money, rinse and repeat. Since this is a 401k account (also works for IRA and Roth accounts) I can't touch any gains for decades so I have no other option than to buy more stock to keep compounding monetary gains.

When will I take money out? When the govt says I can - typically around age 65.

Hopefully this overly long post helps you in some way. These are a few of my strategies, there are many others, but only you can know what's best for you and when you think it's a good time to cash in."

I took partial assignment only once, then I simply rolled up and out. This generated a nice side income and preserved the stock, that I still own since 2000.
To your question, unless you need significant amounts all at once, I don’t think you need to ever sell. I like to think of OTM CCs as rental income from my stock."

So no, I don't guess. But if you're telling me there's an accurate solution to every stock transaction then sorry, but everyone would mint money. No one is perfect, at the end you cannot avoid some degree of uncertainty. 

My point was, how do you know when to exit, and whether jumping ships (like in this case google to apple) is advisable or not. If you're saying just have a target sell price in mind, then how do I set it? Based on past trends? Sales? Projected earnings? News?"

2021-06-04 20:36:17,stocks,"I'm advising you to have a strategy, not to execute it perfectly. That's two completely different things. 

You seem like you're getting upset at me, and perhaps I offended you with the just guessing part, but then tell me, what exactly is the input you used to get a 10-20% (which is a wide variance) over a 12 month period?

There needs to be an input to get an output. Especially if you come up with a numerical output, it requires a numerical input. 

Don't get frustrated, I'm trying to help, and you keep brushing over my main point.

Entrance strategy!

You're thinking about it backwards. You're trying to figure out how to exit a stock, before you figure out how to enter one. You have to have an entrance strategy first. 

That is why you're asking this question and don't have an answer. 

If you enter a stock because of a valuation, you sell when it exceeds a valuation.

If you entered a stock because of a trend, you sell when it breaks that trend.

If you enter a stock because of a growth rate, you sell when it stops growing. 

If you enter a stock because of its quality, you sell when that quality diminishes.

And yes, sometimes you'll still be wrong. You'll never find a perfect strategy, or execute it perfectly. But you'll know what you're doing and why, and that will lead to a lot more positive and consistent results over the long run. 

As far as right now, you can reevaluate. Think of it as buying a stock for the first time. What is your strategy going to be, and which stock fits that strategy better right now Google or Apple?"

That's why I don't like general, very well known companies, their growth is minimal.

I personally keep thing simple, buying bunch of necessity ETFs such as USMV, VNQ, VAW, XLP, XLV, GSG for the coming 6 to 9 months because I feel those can go up 15 to 20% without much concern of competitions since everyone needs it unlike Apple or Google products or services."

I think I should do this more often than buying based on news and taking analyst's words for it.

2021-06-05 00:00:00,stocks,"$WKHS: what just happened? Anyone care to take a look?   

All, 

Context: I’m looking for a much smarter person than I that can explain what the hell just happened with $WKHS. This could be manipulation or a typical market approach by a bigger player but I just don’t know. I am hoping someone here can provide some context. I had pictures but those are not allowed here.

$WKHS had a great run-up from June 2020 to early February 2021. A variety of factors here, but EV/possible USPS contract/new delivery methods all played a role. Since then, it has been smashed down (peak at $40 down to $7ish):

[https://www.tradingview.com/chart/3QJLgzZ7/](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/3QJLgzZ7/)

There is some news here that led to the sell-off:

Workhorse Sinks 52% in Two Days After Losing USPS Award

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-24/workhorse-sinks-54-in-two-days-after-losing-out-on-usps-award](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-24/workhorse-sinks-54-in-two-days-after-losing-out-on-usps-award)

Anyway, after being crushed down and watching the chart for the last 6 months, WKHS had a massive spike on June 3rd, yesterday:

(had pic but refer to chart: [https://www.tradingview.com/chart/3QJLgzZ7/](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/3QJLgzZ7/))

Media would tell you that spike was due to meme stock status (I had not seen WKHS on much of Reddit at all):

(had pic but can see the results here): [https://www.google.com/search?q=wkhs+stock&client=firefox-b-1-d&source=lnms&tbm=nws&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiLjbnx5\_7wAhUbHc0KHVAbASwQ\_AUoAnoECAEQBA&biw=2208&bih=1079](https://www.google.com/search?q=wkhs+stock&client=firefox-b-1-d&source=lnms&tbm=nws&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiLjbnx5_7wAhUbHc0KHVAbASwQ_AUoAnoECAEQBA&biw=2208&bih=1079)

There are other articles about meme $WKHS from Bloomberg, Motley, and The Street as well if you want to check for yourself. That made me suspicious. I’d been watching this ticker for a while and there was no movement around $WKHS – unless I really did miss that?

Now, today, June 4th, we are already seeing the media change their narrative as $WKHS begins what I assume will be a hard drop:

(had pic but can see the results here): [https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=wkhs+stock](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=wkhs+stock)

That seems to be quite the rug pull, no? I kept digging and this is where I was hoping to get some clarification. I can view limited details on holdings through whalewisdom. I wanted to check $WKHS and found two rather large call/put bets placed by Susquehanna and Citadel:

[https://whalewisdom.com/stock/ampd](https://whalewisdom.com/stock/ampd)

Can someone give more context to the details of this play? I assume these huge bets had to play a role in this latest spike and now possible heavy reversal. Thanks for taking the time to read and cheers.

I do not have a position in $WKHS."
2021-06-05 10:15:26,stocks,The big squeeze is happening soon.  Shares are still well priced even without a squeeze and the company is on an upward trajectory.   Any bad news was already priced in before last week.   Hedge funds won’t be able to hold this back for long.  I’m loading the boat on Monday.
2021-06-04 23:30:37,stocks,"Not sure of everyone's interest in WKHS. A better play is Arrival (ARVL). They are basically WKHS, but a legitimate player. 

ARVL has a 10k van order with UPS with another 10k possible on deal. First 10k will all be delivered by 2024 and should start receiving next year. UPS also has invested in them. 

They have a unique microfactory system that allows for them to get a new factory built in about 6 months for under $50m which allows them to build factories in places for a more effective supply chain. These microfactories can produce up to 10k vans in a year. A typical car plant takes 2 years and costs about $1bn. Currently, they have a plant being built in South Carolina.

Additionally, ARVL has a bus being tested in the UK as a next level product. They have a partnership with Uber to design and build affordable EV's for them. 

Overall, ARVL is still a risky play as they aren't producing anything, but if the vans work for UPS, the microfactory setup works, the bus proves effective, and the Uber partnership works out this stock could be a huge gainer by 2023/2024. I've been in since April and I'm up about 35%.

I recommend checking them out. https://arrival.com/"
2021-06-04 20:25:22,stocks,"According to Capital IQ it’s about 41% of the float, so it does have a lot of attention. The idea that it failed for now doesn’t fit in, the volatility is well within recent short squeezes so it’s not necessarily a sign that the positions have been covered."

2021-06-05 13:59:36,stocks,"So, naked shorts is when you have more short positions than positions available to buy. So if there’s 1000 total shares (1000 as an example because I want to convert to percentages as an explanation without doing math) of a company, and 800 are held, the float is 200. In this example, 82 shares sold short would be 41% of the float (82/200 * 100)But, since if they had to cover all their positions there would be enough shares to buy, those are not naked shorts. Now say people pile on and buy 150 shares, now the short positions become naked shorts because there aren’t enough positions left to cover all of their shorts."
2021-06-05 14:28:35,stocks,"When you say 800 shares are held do you mean by individual investors and or institutions? So 200 shares are issued by the company and available for sale.

Outstanding shares would then be 1,000?"
2021-06-05 14:36:45,stocks,"So, for the purpose of explaining what a naked short is, the company would have 1,000 shares which could be sold, in this example 800 are initially held (by investors or institutions), and the float would be 200 (or the liquidity sometimes) which are shares not held by anyone. The percentage of the float shorted is then simply the percentage of shares sold short compared shares available to be bought. So if investors hold 800 shares, the float is 200. If 82 shares are sold short, then 41% of the float is shorted. This is not a naked short position because the shares are available to be purchased. To hold a short position, you pay interest because you essentially “borrowed the shares” to be bought back at a later time at hopefully a lower price, so you’re paying interest on what you borrow. If people buy more shares though, it can put the short positions into a place where there aren’t enough available shares to cover their positions so they’ll have to pay interest on their short positions because there aren’t enough available to buy."

2021-06-05 03:03:39,stocks,"This is not only US.

Central Europe.

10+% increase in house / flat prices per year. Last 3-4 years or so.

The prices are quite disconnected from the average salaries here. Yes the salaries in some sectors are growing, yes the mortgage rates are in 0.5-1.0% range.

Most of the employees survived the covid situation without huge cuts / losses. But many high paying jobs are in services which can be easily outsourced to cheaper countries and it's already happening although 400-500 jobs lost is not much and market can absorb those people.

So reaching 300-500K € per house in city where average salary is at best 20K € per year.

3 rooms flats - 5-10 years old = 220-250+ €

There was however drop in rent prices minus 10-15% from beginning of year.

I see it like this.

220K € flat. You need 20% downpayment. So mortgage 176000€. For 30 years that's around 500€. This is reasonable for a couple or even a single person with average salary. One can consider some salary increase over those 30 years.

\- - -

The central bank started however limiting how big the mortgage can be and now it's like 8 \* yearly netto salary. So far the demand for new houses is still higher then supply so this also pushing the prices up.I really wonder for how many years yet the prices can go 10-15% up every year."
2021-06-04 20:08:02,stocks,"My personal opinion is that we are most likely in a bubble. Not only a housing bubble, an “everything bubble.” Every asset is overvalued; stocks, bonds, housing, commodities, SPACs, etc. People love to think they have it all figured out and we are definitively either in a bubble or not in a bubble. They love to say, “this isn’t like last time. This isn’t the same as the GFC. This isn’t the same as the .com bubble. This isn’t the same as black Monday.” Well no shit it’s not like those other instances. Every bubble is different. We learn from our mistakes. But the reality of the matter is that something is driving assets prices higher than they should be. Unfortunately, once the bubble has popped all we can do is look in hindsight and see the problem so evident, and often times flagrant, it’s a miracle all the economic wizards missed it."

A. Once this normalizes, the cost of building a new home will come down. 
2. 2.2 mill people are in a mortgage forbearance program right now, preventing foreclosures.  
B. These programs are ending and as of May, 70% of those still in the program have not made any payments or made an exit plan. 
3. Interest rates are super low.  
C. Interest rates will go up again. 

4. The shift to work from home means many workers in high COL areas can move to low COL areas but are still making the same amount.   
D. This is more of a case for prices staying higher than normal in some desirable areas.

6 but just an observation. I’ve seen some FOMO among my friends. Like, “prices are hot! I’d better buy now whether I really want to or not!”. Idk, might be driving the prices. 

Anyways, I don’t think the market will crash or anything, but it should normalize to the rates before the pandemic, or what it would be if there hadn’t been any issues."
2021-06-04 23:15:03,stocks,"The average median price for a home is around $350,000 these days.  It went up 19% over the last 12 months.  It would be easy to dismiss this as a transitory price bubble, if it were not for the fact everything else is rising in price too.  Gasoline is up 80%, lumber up 290%, and the list goes on.  What we are really seeing is a decline in the US dollar's value due to inflation.  Did you know there are 40% more dollars in circulation today than 2 years ago?  All those trillions of COVID stimulus spending on top of a national debt now at $30 trillion.  The system is breaking as evidenced by the substantial inflation.  Back in the late 1970s we had 20% inflation annually for several years.  Looks to be coming again."

2021-06-04 23:16:59,stocks,"Millennials are starting families and buying homes. Supply limited due to no one selling with still unknowns from pandemic. Interest rates at historical all time low. Stocks at all time highs.

Desirable neighborhoods will sky rocket for these reasons. Until rates go up or stocks go down, more home can be afforded. The home you didn’t buy last month is the new comp for this month, so prices will naturally rise until the markets change.

The bubble won’t pop till interest rates go up. The math shows a lower interest rate is better than a low purchase price if you’re getting a 30 year fixed."

Forget banks.  The big box home improvement stores  (Home Depot, Menards, Lowes) will totally finance your home improvement project, and which time you can use the house you built to get a proper mortgage and use the house you just built/refurbished as capital.

If you can get a distressed house in the current market you will do really well.  You are only going to make money on distressed houses, the real estate market is super efficient.

The number one mistake new house flippers make is not realizing the most expensive features on a house are the kitchen and the bathroom, and the home owners are the only ones who know what they want.  Make the kitchen and the bath rooms work, don't try to make them nice.

Take advantage of floating vinyl flooring while it is all the rage."

If these tax credits still manage to pass through congress it will be fueling another massive housing boom due to these free money likely going to landlords that will collect rent. If most will be blocked, then growth should be on states that are not poorly managed.

US housing by metrics like price to median income actually shows it's way undervalued compared to many other major economies, if places like canada, Australia, Hong Kong, UK aren't seeing their price dropping, then there is close to 0% chance that US housing will drop, Chances are US housing is about to see another historic rally ahead and this is just the beginning of something super explosive that will shock many people."

2021-06-05 02:23:51,stocks,I think there are a few things going on...  There is a ton of money available.  A younger generation can now afford housing.  There is a flight from high cost of living areas like California to cheaper areas now that professionals can work from home.  Commodity prices (lumber) are high so housing starts are dropping.  IMO it’s simply a supply and demand issue.  Not sure it’s a bubble but supply is tight due to overwhelming demand.  A bubble implies that demand subsides.  I’m not so sure it will for a bit yet.
2021-06-05 03:16:34,stocks,"People I know that are buying up houses are really just your average Joe, either finding local programs that allow them to get a loan to meet the initial down payment requirement and finance at a slightly higher interest, OR they just go with FHA and put down 3.5%. Nobody's putting 20% down to buy a house in this market.

Either way, they're all buying above their means, we're talking couples that each make like $20-$25/hr in Colorado.

Do I think we'll see the bubble pop in the next year or so?  not sure, this could go a a bit longer I think and who knows what the government would do to intervene . But will it pop before the next election cycle? I think so. I'm just gonna save up what I can and see if the real estate market gets any more reasonable.

So many people are also buying houses knowing that they're overextending but because they're afraid this might be their last opportunity to even buy a house because once rates go up and the housing prices does not come down a significant amount, they won't be able to purchase a home at all. But I don't really see that happening, US is too damn large to have a housing shortage."
2021-06-05 05:15:09,stocks,"K feel like they’re buying less of a house than they could really want. For example, we were prepared to buy a bigger house for our family of 6, but there’s no way we could qualify for a 5- 600k loan for a house that’s maybe 3k sq feet to fit us all so we’d settle for a smaller house at 350k.... I mean we’re not- we’re going to throw our money away renting until the bubble bursts or my 7 BB stocks make us millions.... but you get the idea"

I think the pandemic nudged the adult kids who lived with their parents out the door.  Living with mom and dad as an adult isn’t a big deal when you only see each other in the evenings for a few hours at most but suddenly being cooped up with them all day and night makes you want to pull your hair out.  The low interest rates and being able to work from home added to that.  I think a bunch of kids finally grew up and took the leap into home ownership.  Like I said, not the only reason but definitely one of the motivators I think.  That was the case for me tbh.  Don’t think I’m judging kids living with mom and dad, I was one.  So please don’t take the tone of my post the wrong way"

Rent is also going parabolic in big citys especially. Hamburg, munich is expceptionally crazy. This needs to be a fucking big ass bubble, there is nothing that explains it otherwise. Big guys buy everything rn over here. Lots of new homes are build and i dont know how. Like land is ultimately expensive, and i could not afford to buld a house on it after paying 500 per sqare meter.

There’s a strong correlation between US debt and US Dollar Value going back a hundred years. It’s the easiest way to pay down massive debt.

Combine that with the foreclosure memorandum and you have a bubble. I was at LAX today and a guy from Boise, Idaho said their home prices have skyrocketed  to California prices. Also a couple from Las Vegas said their prices are insane and no one is Vegas works last year. 

Pasadena home prices rose 37% from last year. My town. Crazy to think when I spent 430k on a modest house in 2014, I thought I was over paying bigly. Original list price was 390k.

Quickest way to tell someone has no idea what they're talking about. 

Sure...hyperinflation....which mean inflation rising at a rate of 50% a month. 

And what did we have, about 4% YOY...wow talk about being way, way, way, way, I can't emphasize enough, way off.

Oh but let me guess, you're not wrong. You super smart big brained fellow. Ofcourse not. You see when the reality doesn't match up with your bias, you aren't going to admit you're wrong, ofcourse not, inflation hawks never do. You'll just claim ""everyone else and every possible measure of inflation is actually wrong! Not me!""

Or my favorite...""oh just wait! it's coming! Eventually!"" Ofcourse, at this far off, unspecified date, that you never mention, and never stick to, so once again, you never admit you're wrong. 

Hyperinflation isn't happening.

Get over it. 

Also, for anyone actually interested this ""printing of money"" was just providing liquidity to the market during the largest deflationary period since the great depression. Which is why it isn't inflationary. 

And as for everyone that wants to look at that ""M2 money graph go brrrrrr"" chart and think explaining inflation is that simple...well they conveniently leave out an important part to that. M2 velocity, which is the actual rate at which money is being used in the system. Which is what actually matters.

I don't remember where I saw the statistics of how many renters aren't paying, however, the number has gone down significantly in the last 6 months. Same with not paying mortgages. However, the number is still a LOT higher than it was in 2019. 

Depending on state laws, IIRC only mortgages backed by FHA(?) are in a no-eviction status, and so landlords with private loans or no loans have been evicting in some states. 

There's also different laws if the owner of a rental changes - the new owner, in some states, has the right to evict."

It's almost like you're being penalized for trying to keep your home and burning through your savings to do so, while others who choose to just up and leave get to do it with a nice fat check for your left over equity. It may be the dynamic that makes everyone rush for the exit."

Hmm...

>Sure...hyperinflation....which mean inflation rising at a rate of 50% a month.

Haven't said it's here now. But printing on unprecedented scale ""could"" lead to inflation on unprecedented scale. And the road to 50%/year is much shorter than you might think due to how people will constantly try to stay ahead of the inflationary curve once the ball gets rolling officially.

>And what did we have, about 4% YOY.
If you trust official measures perhaps it's you that has no clue what's what. Anyway the rate of influation is influenced by many factors that aren't it's current level so how's that a proof inflation is not accelerating or getting higher?

Your side:  Ok for a home purchase price of 255,000, 20% down and 3% interest rate on a 30 year fixed

Loan= roughly 860 a month (Zillow calc)
Plus I had to pay 46,000 out of pocket on top of the loan to purchase the house

My side: I waited till interest rates went up, but I don’t have to bid over ask or pay that 46,000 over appraised value 

Buy same house for asking price 255,000/30 years at 4%=974 a month so my payment is 112$ a month higher than yours, but I have 46,000 in my pocket. 
So I will pay roughly 40,320 by the end of the 30 year  loan. 

I put that money under the mattress I still have more than the guy who paid over appraised value right?

2021-06-05 12:34:10,stocks,"I don't have beefs in this argument. But I just think you are making a lot of assumptions. I think the main assumption you are making is that you can get a similar house at a similar price point just with a higher mortgage rate in a few years. That is unlikely to be true. It is more likely you will get a smaller house with a worse rate of appreciation at the same price point. 

And you also have to consider that real estate is naturally a leveraged investment. So the rate of return is much higher. For example, if you put $100,000 into a $500,000 house a couple years ago. Now the house is worth $600,000. And you would have made 100% return of your investment, even though the appreciation of the house is only at 12%. 

Lastly, real estate in its nature is a tax-advantaged investment unlike regular stock brokerage. For example, the mortgage interest is tax deductible and $250,000/$500,000 capital gains from sale are tax exemption. So when you make comparison, you will have to take that into account.

EDIT:

It seems like quite a large number of these [immigrants](https://www.canadavisa.com/canada-immigration-levels-plans.html#gs.35ws3l) are very unlikely to be homebuyers and the pace of immigration is expected to increase about 2.5%/yr over the next 3 years."

Technology:

Most people see wish as a simple buy platform. But its way more they have deep learning meaning the company has software that studies the costumers behavior and proposes to them products. This has lead to 70% of sales not being from searches but from the menu.

They use a discovery based menu which is very attractive and also focus on personalized browsing just like tik tok does deep learning at its finest.

They collect data from more than 100 million users every month to personalize the menu even more giving them a very unique advantage. Using data is the key to success here because they use data to get better and more effective ads to maximiaze returns and conversion .

Growth

They grew revenue from $1.1 billion in 2017 to $1.9 billion in 2019 at a compound annual growth rate of 31% and from $1.3 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 to $1.7 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, an increase of 32% revenue is diversified and global. In 2019, 93% of our revenue was from marketplace services, 84% of which was from core marketplace revenue and 16% of which was from our native advertising tool, ProductBoost, and 7% was from logistics services.

They refer to marketplace revenue, excluding revenue from ProductBoost, as core marketplace revenue. ProductBoost is an advertising feature by which our merchants can promote their listings within user feeds.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, 82% of revenue was from marketplace services, 90% of which was from core marketplace revenue and 10% of which was from ProductBoost, and 18% was from logistics services.

In terms of geographic diversification by users, for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, 43% of core marketplace revenue came from Europe, 42% from North America, 5% from South America, and 10% from the rest of the world growth has been highly capital efficient.

They have been able to achieve this massive growth and scale by having net cumulative cash flow from operations of $16 million from January 1, 2017 to September 30, 2020, aided by their positive cash float, where they receive an upfront payment from a user, and remit payment to a merchant a number of weeks later.

Merchants

They are basically the middle man that connects millions of costumers with merchants. They also provide them with value data to help them do more sales and expand even more. Analytics and data is a key part of their business and it should not be ignored

What's is not so great about them

They grew to fast and have some problems with logistics

There have been some serious delays and even packages missing. They will need to use money from going public to solve this matter and get better at serving costumers.

There business model is to expand advertise and get new costumers. But their problems in logistic could cause them problems with visitor retention and i want to see improvements here.

Conclusion and My Point of View :

I'm not hoping that it will be the next amazon probably will not be,but if the management hundle All the challenges and go profitable, this can have huge upside, and even without that, it have already a great upside potential (That's why average target analysts is about 24$).

Still not entered Indian market wich can be huge.

I have no doubt that a huge part of their increased sales and earnings is attributable to advantages from the pandemic, from amplified purchases of goods from food and toilet paper to clothes and light fixtures. Not to mention, with the amount of time spent at home, sales for digital services like Prime Video likely reached a peak. Those advantages are going to wear away as people begin to shop for things in person that, while they would prefer to see and size-up a purchase on the spot, they have had little choice except to buy online, sight unseen. 

That's not to say that they can't grow further, but I would say that that kind of price target in the next year either has to assume continued massive growth, which I feel is unlikely with the pandemic unwinding, or that speculation and momentum will be enough to carry it there. The latter carried Tesla to about 1 trillion in market cap on negative earnings, so Amazon could certainly hit the target and exceed it; such a feat would be less ridiculous, IMO."

Amazon is famous for its 5% PIP culture (fire 1 in 20 devs a year no matter what) but last year that number spiked to 15\~20% PIP culture to take advantage of the job market.

This thing is backfiring hard. Software engineers in AWS are leaving left and right in waves right now. AWS at this rate is struggling to innovate/fix bugs/etc. There's a huge brain drain that's been going on in AWS side since the past month or two.

The very type of stuff you saw back in Microsoft's lost decade with Balmer. Amazon really screwed itself with its stupid work life culture (""""work life harmony"""") + unprecedented PIP culture (a MUST fire X% regardless of talent).

Diversify.

Read news articles about apple going down Further.

Lost hope in the stock.

Could have DCAd but was so afraid to invest any more money in the stock.

Saw the red yesterday and lost all hope finally.

Finally today morning, sold it all at 125 taking a 70 dollar loss.

Apple then went up to 126.

But i have tried to understand some things from my mistakes and apply them in the future. I will write them out. If you have better advice I will be very grateful to learn.

1. I understood I do not have the appetite to put 20k dollars in one or two large companies and just ride the downs and ups out. No matter how good the companies are.. Yes I completely misunderstood myself honestly.
I thought Apple Amazon are large companies. Even if they go down. I will hold. I won't sell. I believe in them. Many other things.

Someone saying they are down 5k dollar in apple. Then r/wallstreetbets saying when citadel falls, they will take down apple with them... Reading and hearing all this I just.... Became extremely nervous...

2. I have decided to invest only in etfs for now. I will equally divide my money between VOO, VOOB, VOOG VO VOT VOR... I am not comfortable with the small caps so I will stay away from them..

3. I believed it was possible to earn on the stock market everyday. I did not know anything about the market. I started 2 weeks back and in 2 weeks I made 300 dollars.. I was overjoyed. I became confident and overconfident and finally made this mistake. I know it was lucky streak.

4.i have observed that day trading is extremely difficult to do. That is what I tried with Apple and Amazon. On the day I bought these stocks, for one hour after buying, i was 20 dollars up.. I decided to hold and then...... I will not day trade any more.

5. I learnt that currently there has been a lot of push towards financial institutions rather than tech. That is why I have decided to hedge my bets equally on the etfs i mentioned.

6. I have decided to never yolo everything into company again. Maybe 4 or 5..but never one and keep a balance. For example if a market is down one day and I decided to put 5k in some companies, i will distribute my shares between tech, financial and retail.

7. (This may be wrong) i have seen many days its best not to buy when the market is open. There is a lot of volatility and price may go down. Rapidly.. I have seen many times at close markets fall rapidly. I have tried after hours and pre market trading. I think buying after hours is good. But it always leaves the risk of another crash as market opens. So it may be better to look at pre market sentiments and then buy. But again this is for short term. And i don't want to do it any more.

8. I saw that Apple and Amazon had a kind of flat year. I saw so many news saying Apple and Amazon has same price as aug 2020. However when i look at voo, voob and mid cap etfs.i see they have a slope.it may be small but they still have. I would rather be in a etf like that than wait for apple to make me rich.

9. OH HERE is a the funniest one. I did not know that after selling a stock, you have to wait for 2 days before you can buy again. Due to repeatedly buying and selling, i had good Faith violations. This resulted in me unable to recover my losses on of the days. (i forget what i planned to do).

10. I know you cannot earn money everyday in the market. I became greedy. My initial goal was to earn 50 dollars a month. I became so greedy even after earning 300 dollars.i kept on doing stupid things. Anyway i learnt my lesson. Unfortunately i still have 10k dollars stuck with Amazon. I am just hoping prime day gives me the break i need.
I just want to get out of this mess. My breakeven is 3230.so I will hope to just get that figure..

The buy of Xilinx has basically made AMDs PE multiple go up and that scares people short term. For example it is 34.63 right now. After the Xilinx acquisition which it will be 38.14*

This scares off some people. However as an AMD long term investor, I don't mind this because it allows for more sustainable growth and the growth makes the company a reasonable value.

Also think about this.

As a long term investor, with it being an all stock buyout it is actually kind of beneficial for the price to stay down for the short term as it will mean the Xilinx acquisition will be cheaper and in the long term we will be diluted less.. I think anyways...

One commenter specifically brought up the current silicon shortage and therefore predicted movement in 2022, so I think if you’re someone who likes to invest in stocks for the long term, you’ll definitely have some time to get in and make a nice 20-25%+ gain if it pans out.   

Of course, if you like the hustle and bustle of trading every few days/hrs, then this likely sounds like a foolish idea, but I, for one, am starting to “warm up” (I know, sorry!) to solar stocks and may sell some of my oil-related stocks in the next couple of months and invest in some of these guys."

2021-06-04 22:58:18,stocks,one can be pro solar and anti net-metering.  net-metering is a subsidy.  Every form of energy is a subsidizied - which isn't my point.  my point is there is a 99.9% probability net metering has to go away a some point.  A utility can't exist with it when a renewable becomes a significant part of the total power.  Eventually if you want the reliability of the grid users will need to pay for it.

Your rosy estimate might be accurate in the sunny deserts of Arizona, but mine is accurate for the rainy northwest, snowy northeast and frozen north-central states  Solar panels simply don't work when they are covered in 6 inches of snow!  Panels produce much less electricity on cloudy rainy days, which is basically all the time in Seattle and Portland OR.  

A neighbor of mine looked into a home system in 2019 and, after accounting for a batteries and maintenance, the payback period was 27 years. You must factor in how many days the system will actually generate electricity.  This is what happens in states with sustained snow cover during the winter.  Are you going to go up on your roof with a snow shovel and broom every day to clear the panels?  That sounds safe.  LOL"

2021-06-04 20:04:42,stocks,">Also whats hard to recycle about panels? its literally just steel or aluminum, glass, tiny bit of copper and a thin film of solar cells. Nothing bad here.

You obviously didn't look into how solar panels are recycled, as I mentioned in the comment you are replying to.  The PV cells themselves are the problem, and tend to contain the same kind of chemicals you find in most other electronics, making them hazardous waste. In case you didn't know, the heavy metals from these can leech into the ground & groundwater, contaminating nearby areas. This is from last year:   [Source](https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2020/12/03/solar-panel-recycling-in-the-us-a-looming-issue-that-could-harm-growth-and-reputation/)

""Overall, SEIA has said that around 140,000 solar panels are being installed per day in the U.S. BloombergNEF has further estimated that around 26,000 tons of PV panels will end up as waste this year. That number is going to grow into the millions of tons as waves of panels reach their end-of-life in the 2030s. Indeed, North America has more than 80 GW of solar installed and could see this number grow to more than 400 GW by 2030.""

(Edit: In case that wasn't good enough for you, also see [here](https://dtsc.ca.gov/photovoltaic-modules-pv-modules-universal-waste-management-regulations/), and [here](https://www.intechopen.com/books/reliability-and-ecological-aspects-of-photovoltaic-modules/toxic-materials-used-in-thin-film-photovoltaics-and-their-impacts-on-environment), or just use a search engine to find it for yourself.)

To answer your question though, Hydropower is the alternative.  To my knowledge, there is no waste from this method of power generation, though we do have to be smart about placement as it can still impact the surrounding areas."
2021-06-04 23:44:30,stocks,"Completely untrue. My ""rosy"" estimates are actually the calculations for Toronto, a place full of snow firing the winter. I've also looked at people who did the math from Pennsylvania, in the areas where there are tons of snow. And you talk about a lot depends on what part of the country you're in. Yet, you chose to use your neighbors experience, which, believe it or not is not the entire country. Or anywhere close to the average. You used two cities and concluded that it must somehow be 20+ years in order to break even."

2021-06-04 23:46:17,stocks,"You linked an article about thin Film panels. Thin film panels are like unicorns. But lets not go into the minutia. The other article is just about logistics which is not a major issue and never will be. The life time of panels is long.

Less than 1% of total panel weight are metalic chemical that have any complexity to their recycling. None of them are particularly toxic and are found in almost all electronics. So in other words, this is a non issue unless someone turns it into one by dumping illegally. Most of this stuff will indeed be recycled and used again but again, there is very little of it to begin with... if you take all the panels on my roof right now, you are looking about 6lbs of chemicals. These things have a lifetime of over 30 years... 6lbs per 30 years is nothing. The real problem is not panels, its batteries which dont last as long.

Water power is great but capacity is a problem and requires moving parts. Moving parts means constant maintenance and there is always a chance of major catastrophe or obsolescence though we have done well in the USA on that end. Further, how are you going to find enough water power to power a country? Are you suggesting some sort of ocean wave capture? The cost to maintain that is likely astronomical which is why we dont do it.

All the dams combined in the US barely have a capacity of 80GW. Realistically, they generate about 250TWh of energy a year which is what they have done for decades and its not like you can get a lot more. We have hit most of the big rivers. The US needs about 4000 TWh a year... and thats without considering the move from ICE to eV. 

So in other words, thats not realistic and I think your concern about solar waste is overblown. Right now we need to get off combustion. That should be priority #1. Once we do that, then we can figure out how to optimize other things."
2021-06-05 04:56:17,stocks,"If you had actually read the link, you would have seen the article was about PV panels in general, not just thin film ones.  The thin film (unicorn as you put it) panels are the only ones you can currently recycle in the US, and only if they were produced by the same company that has the recycling program, which again, was in the article you didn't appear to read.

My quoted portion of the article in my above comment explains exactly how much waste by weight currently is headed to and forecasted to head into landfills.  Not sure why you think your 1% weight thing matters, the housing and other bits that can be recycled easily get torn off and separated, before they have to deal with the difficult to recycle part (also in the article).  I also mentioned in my previous comment that the PV cells share lots of these chemicals with other electronics.  I'm also not sure why you think electronics waste is harmless, when countless studies have shown otherwise, and are commonly cited in articles from various popular publications over the last couple of decades.

You asked for an alternative to solar, I gave one.  I don't think it could power the entire US, and neither can solar.   No one solution will power the whole country.  That would be ridiculous and also incredibly unrealistic.  Especially without a proper disposal plan in place to deal with a problem that's already occurring.

Perhaps I am overconcerned about it, I don't have much data to compare to, besides what I'm hearing from my own industry.  What I do know is, most electronics recyclers I'm aware of want nothing to do with your solar panels, because of how troublesome they are to deal with, legally, financially, & operationally.  This problem is only going to get exponentially worse as things continue if it isn't addressed."
2021-06-04 20:22:11,stocks,"Funny I know no one that feels that way, anyone I know that can afford it, has solarpanels. When I can afford, I'm getting them"
2021-06-04 22:25:41,stocks,No idea what youre talking about. You answering the right comment?
2021-06-04 21:13:20,stocks,Me too. It’s just internet people so yeah. I’ve talked to them and I guess repeating their stuff isn’t needed.
2021-06-04 20:01:55,stocks,I'm not sure where to start here. I have Jinko on a watchlist for solar sector I have not admittedly gone in depth with them but you seem polite courteous here so I want to run a few things your way. The market cap is the shares x share price at I believe 2B. That is the equity value of the company. The enterprise value is plus debt. Meaning the price someone would have to pay to buy the entire business thus including buying paying for their debts. The enterprise value is 24B. The first thing that says to me is that this company is extremely over leveraged and in debt. Total debt is 27B. So they are in fact extremely over leveraged here. There debt to equity is a very unhealthy 200x. There debt to EBITDA is likewise very unhealthy 10x. Their EBITDA margin is only 10%. Very low. This company is over leveraged with poor margins. At 8x EV EBITDA at a 10% EBITDA I wouldn't say they are not undervalued or certainly not the most undervalued solar company. If interest rates go up Jinko becomes encumbered by debt.
2021-06-04 20:05:12,stocks,There growth rate which I have not forward calculated would have to be 15-30% imo to even start a conversation about being undervalued or holding forward value worth investing in. I believe many competitors have higher growth prospects much higher margin and way less debt. There debt is unbelievable. How does that even happen.
2021-06-04 22:38:11,stocks,Yep thats what I see on their site too. Not bad. Battery prices are definitely falling. It used to be $14k just to install one powerwall.
2021-06-04 22:36:58,stocks,Those are very good points. The only thing I would add is that debt to that degree could mean creditors who are excited enough about the company's prospects to allow it to incur that debt
2021-06-04 20:24:46,stocks,There’s no installation cost. They are the cheapest out there and I really wanted the Powerwall. They are probably taking a lost for market gain.
2021-06-04 22:48:57,stocks,Mostly puts them at risk and a discount. Shareholders are last to get equity back. Creditors first . Also can not fund additional growth take on debt or get meaningful cash flow when servicing such an insane debt load. Haven't looked deep into company but it's a red flag. Capital intensive business without fixed assets makes it worse. Not like they own GWs of solar assets here. Gross margins only 16% too. Wouldn't want to buy any solar stock less than 24% gross or a manufacturer at that. Developers and owners are better value and the way to go forward looking. Northeast USA midscale will have higher growth. Uge is a good place for that.
2021-06-05 08:56:21,stocks,Looking more into Jinko. Yahoo finance Financials and metrics are wrong on the Nasdaq listed holding company. The book value per share is 5.65 not 200 and price to book is 8 not 0.17. Not sure if you were using these erroneous yahoo numbers. Their assets to debt isn't so bad. Growth is okay. Mexico domiciled EV/EBITDA 20. Definitely not the most undervalued solar company. Fairly valued to me. What metrics do you have or use towards Jinko being undervalued?
2021-06-04 20:30:04,stocks,"Yea with no installation cost they are taking a loss forsure. I mean those guys arent working for free so this makes sense. Especially because someone just sued tesla for changing terms halfway through the process post contract. Also, they have a really high attrition rate, where they just dont follow through on collecting payment or installing. Their way of garnering your business first and then checking for profitability later. I work in solar and have heard this from real customers with real contracts in hand"
2021-06-04 22:43:45,stocks,"Thats probably not true. The panels and rails dont cost anywhere near $8k for a 4kW system using a central inverter. Maybe $5k tops. So you are paying about $3k for the install which is fair honestly.

The cost for 6kW is barely $6k. Another $1k for permit and misc wiring, breaker, conduit, etc."

2021-06-05 13:16:40,stocks,"Fair point, yes the actual figure for customer retention is 94.4% per month, which would result in about 70% customer retention in 6 months. Comparing that to other subscription box service: Stitchfix six-month retention is 30 percent. 

So for a subscription box service, which typically always has a lot of customer retention issues, Barkbox is one of (if not the) most successful at doing so. 

Their marketing budget is quite high but they have an incredible social media presence, they have a ton of followers on Instagram, more than chewy or petco.

Also their gross margins on their products are reallly good because they are vertically integrated.

Outside of the subscription service they also sell toys in big box stores."

2021-06-05 09:48:33,stocks,"There are thousands of stocks traded on the NYSE alone. Plenty of hidden gems that nobody is talking about. You can focus on the meme stocks or not, it's up to you. But there is plenty 9f other stuff out there."
2021-06-05 12:46:40,stocks,"If you're in the meme stocks or coins then it's madness, if you have nothing invested in them they you don't pay a whole lot of attention to them. I have an account with long term holdings, TGT, AAPL, LMT, etc. that I don't check that often and consider boring.

I have a day trading account that is utter madness and I'm balls deep options, reading forums, twitter, CNBC, etc. If I take a break from that account for a week or two then stocks are boring again.

The mania will die down, this is just like 1999 in terms of craze, everyone was jumping in and YOLOing. That blew up and it took 20 year for retail to really come back. This time might be different and we'll retain more retail but the madness will pass."
2021-06-05 09:43:01,stocks,"A rise in interest rates will ultimately force a lot of hobbyist stock traders and gamblers out of the market.

2021-06-05 07:59:48,stocks,"NPR (Planet Money or The Indicator) interviewed a guy who expressed that perspective to a ridiculous degree. Came from poverty, struggled to buy a house in CA as an audio technician of some kind, lost on a meme stock, then made $2 million with the doggo currency (think the name is censored here). He said he's not selling because this is his big chance. Like bro, you already got there. IMO the downside of $2M becoming $200k is much bigger than the upside of $2M becoming $4M-$12M (even if both scenarios are equally likely, & IMO the former scenario is more likely). Take your $2M profit, collect $60k/year with dividend stocks, & enjoy the newfound freedom in career/lifestyle/passion projects. Buy back some of the same currency on a dip if you truly believe in it, but FFS take some profit! People don't know when to change gears & be grateful."
2021-06-05 05:37:45,stocks,"Yup. I’ve been bag holding a few BB stocks for a while. You’re damn right I sold when they finally turned green. I threw in a few quid on AMC when it started to pump and cashed out on the way up. I’m not bag holding another pump and dump again. I’ve still got bags leftover from February, I don’t want anymore!"
2021-06-04 21:53:37,stocks,"I’m very sure those desperate people are those who bought AMC or BB at ATH, so they desperately rally behind the idea of “hold the line” “to the moon” “I’m not selling” “paper hands!” “Hedge fund bot”, in hopes of not ending up as a bag holder. Like, take your loses and move on! The AMC/BB squeeze already ran its course."
2021-06-05 17:44:09,stocks,You don't actually understand anything about what's happened with the share dilution in GME and AMC if you think we're holding bags homie. We're holding winning lottery tickets and you turn up your nose at reading the instructions on how to collect your winnings.

2021-06-05 17:18:10,stocks,"Worse yet they think it's retail driving the prices up.

Retail can't produce those volumes, it's professionals making money on the volatility and then leaving retail with the bag. We even saw this last time with a few funds making huge money on the GME run up and cashing out - especially the ones trading the massively out of the money options and forcing the gamma squeeze.

The retail traders here that think they are ""sticking it to the man"" are massively misguided and should just scalp the run up and GTFO before the house of cards tumbles, it's best to be first but make sure you aren't the last one out."

2021-06-04 23:41:19,stocks,"I did the same thing, put money in AMC and it triggered a stop loss not less than 24 hours later. When I avoid meme stocks and focus on a diverse dividend portfolio I do much better. Each loss is a lesson I guess *shrugs*"
2021-06-05 07:18:37,stocks,"I really like sector ETFs by SPDR.  You wont make as much, you wont lose as much.  Much slower beta meaning timing isnt everything.  I have 15 equities, 5 are ETFs like that.  I just pick what sectors I think will do well over the next year ( for tax purposes obviously ).  Then I do heavy DD onto individual stocks within sectors I think will outperform.  I picked RIG at 1.77 and MRO at 8.20 ( though I started watching it around 6 ) because I knew oil would take off and that those two companies were emerging from challenging times with quality management.  

Every time I lose money, I think that is what an education costs.  Ive been at this for 22 years and I once lost 25% of my portfolio ( hard dollars, not house money ) because I listened to someone else without proper DD.  Never again."
2021-06-05 00:42:47,stocks,Trade quality stocks with PE less than 50. You may still lose but it will be more predictable.
2021-06-05 10:06:54,stocks,"I do that too. I got aggressive about trading stocks directly as trends come in and out of favor, rather than holding the ETF bag forever. I've done okay, but would have been better off just keeping most of my old holdings and not selling out as much."
2021-06-05 16:38:39,stocks,"No because as more electric car companies come to the market, Tesla’s market will decrease. Of course they will go up over time in $ value on paper like any company, but due to the decreasing value of the USD you won’t actually be gaining anything near what you’d think. TSLA as a long term hold is years in the past. Especially now being extremely overvalued. Sell your shares and use your knowledge of typical price action to trade options to make money both ways, especially on the way down ;).

Btw, Michael freaking BURRY is shorting TSLA....

2021-06-05 17:12:14,stocks,"Tesla the company will grow and do insanely well I think.

TSLA the stock I think has peaked for the next 10 years and I sold out of my position starting at $600 and selling the rest of it when it hit $850 or so.

Too much growth is priced in right now, I would becoming a buyer of TSLA again if the P/E can get below ~150 or so, still pricing in insane growth but not complete and utter lunacy."

2021-06-05 14:28:44,stocks,"I don't know the history but it's a useful tool for price discovery.  Allowing people to bet against a stock can be useful for controlling crazy valuations and bubbles.  I read in the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission report that CDS (credit default swaps) like the ones Michael Burry used to bet against the housing bubble actually probably helped rein things in a bit.  It's hard to say ""this mortgage-backed security / stock is worth a gazillion dollars"" when you can clearly see other people betting that it's going to go down.  Thus long investors aren't willing to pay as much for it.

I think it gets a bad rap because in the case of GME, for example, you've got over 100% short interest and hedge funds jumping on a dying company like vultures in order to profit.   Their activity doesn't directly harm the company, but it looks horrible for Gamestop and if Gamestop wanted to raise capital or anything like that it'd be more difficult.  It's also very bad for long investors as it drives the stock price way down.  I suppose it's also an ethical question of making a lot of money off of a company's misfortune, but that's not really the fault of the short sellers."
2021-06-05 14:52:23,stocks,"I would NEVER take on the risk of a Short portion but I do know how they work and why.

Shorting provides a ""Softer Landing"" for overvalued stocks as they come back down to earth.  Legit hedgefunds will start buying to cover as a stock gets closer to reasonable value effectively putting a floor to a sell off. They ""Hedge"" their Long positions by taking Shorts as a cushion to downturns. Most Hedgefunds are 80% long/20% short the market.  These types generally won't enter a short that has than about 8% of the float shorted

It was created simply as another derivative product the same as any options

It can be misused and sometimes is but mostly it's completely legit

The real misuse comes into play when parasites target a vulnerable often small company and fabricate negative info to crush it's stock price

Other times it serves as a financial incentive for effectively investigative journalism in routing out fraudulent companies ripping off stock holders. 

Just because a company is ""short"" doesn't mean they're wrong"

2021-06-05 08:09:02,stocks,"Seems many on reddit have capitulated on ICLN, but I'm still optimistic. They changed their holdings a few months ago to have less volatile stocks (PLUG went from #1 to #8, NEE is now #6 (large utility with consistent stock price growth & major renewable ambitions), Vestas is now #1.) Sure ICLN spiked & fell after the election, but renewables are not a flash in the pan, we'll see decades of major investment in the sector; IMO patient investors will be rewarded by ICLN."
2021-06-05 08:19:36,stocks,"There's such a lack of patience on reddit regarding ICLN. The prospects of renewables have been ramping up for decades, its recent spike & dip only spanned several months. I remember the optimism surrounding renewables in 2008 when Obama & other democrats won big, I imagined we were on the verge of wind turbines & solar panels everywhere, but it didn't happen so fast & there were major crashes in renewable stocks. Now 13 years later I actually do drive by vast wind farms & solar farms; completed projects, expanding projects, new projects. Polling of public concern & belief in climate change has steadily increased, & even Republican politicians are no longer so dismissive. I understand that people got disillusioned by the rocky history & slow progress, & by the recent ICLN selloff, but when you step back for a broader view now doesn't seem like the time to bail. Besides, a few months ago they reconfigured their holdings, & it was a big improvement IMO."

2021-06-04 21:13:12,stocks,I don't know. I would prefer it this way. Seems like a good deal since it's 10% under the valuation and the company will IPO later this year. Probably the only time in my life I will be able to get in on something pre-IPO.

2021-06-05 16:09:47,stocks,"Yes.  The short positions soften the blow from loses on their longs. All in an attempt to maximize gains and limit loses. Sometimes it's not about how much you make but how much you don't lose. 

They don't normally short the same positions they're long. Disciple would see them take profit if a Long runs too hot or becomes shaky. 

They'll look for over-valued or failing companies to hedge their longs against unforeseen market risk.

They will sometimes look to short sectors of the market that have foreseeable market risks that pull down everything at once. Like how we've full market drawdowns from time to time.

It's just about risk management strategy. BUT if they see an opportunity to cash in on a money making short, the more aggressive ones will play this as well"

On Fidelity, I left them alone after my initial allocation in 2015.  I checked on it in 2017 and it had shown really good growth, but looking further, they had 40% of my portfolio in bonds that had negative return!  I was pissed.  I rebalanced it and called the fund manager.  I once again laid out my plans, no more than 15% in bonds, 50% aggressive, 35% moderate and stable.  Within a year, the 40% bonds were back.

FZILX is an international ex-US index fund which means it obviously can't track the S&P and has underperformed the S&P year-to-date, but has absolutely destroyed the S&P in the last month (just to illustrate that it *can* outperform the S&P)

The reason why algo trading may care about the numbers is lets say i buy a stock at 5.5, then a 25% exit point would be 6.87. Algo trading may be looking at where large groups of entries and exits have been made, and correlating the end data on the user side.

While that may or may not be true, well never be able to see which information was utilized for building algorithms. Also, as many have stated, many algos used directly for trading abuse physical factors vs sentiment. When an algorithm is gauging sentiment and more psychological type data sets, its usually the end user who still decides to pull the trigger on a trade.

2021-06-05 16:35:59,stocks,"Hi. I work at a small family re-man and retailer for western red cedar. I’ve worked there for 11 years selling wood and doing other various tasks.


I have seen fence panels on the cheap end go from $45 to $140.

I’ve seen cedar shingles #2 go from $50 to $120. 

I’ve seen PT costs go up almost 60% this year alone (hemfir).


We are adjusting our prices almost every two or three months to costs I have never seen.


We get most of our wood from places like Western Forest Products, Teal Jones, Selkirk.. etc...


We ship globally too, so I think it isn’t just a single barrier of middle men so much as material being “traded” among middlemen, and various products being more trades than others... roofing in particular seems to be traded among retailers a lot, at times crossing the border more than twice though probably not often... which further incurs costs.


I think the industry is a fucking mess, and I think it’s an unorganized mess with little care of how costs are further impacted “as long as inventory is moving” and stock is “on the ground”. 


Some places like us have figured out that we can partner with American entities from Canada and have and hold each other’s stock on the ground to sell into either retailers like Lowe’s or regular home owners... rather than hauling it in at the time of sale, so we are protecting each other’s costs and interests.


But for the most part I feel like the market simply is a mess that is strangling itself. Fibre is of course harder and harder to come by, I guess.... or maybe it’s simply going to select preferred customers like big retailers.


The costs going up was a godsend for the industry I think, and I think they will ride it and squeeze it and of course that has a trickle down effect. Our company is seeing record numbers, and I’m due to make a bonus... but I’m sitting here wondering something else too:



WHY DO PEOPLE KEEP BUYING????? Our actual volume of sales are MIND BLOWING.  The price increases haven’t stopped anyone, in fact it’s like it has spurred them on to buy when normally they might not. Maybe it’s Vancouver being a well-off area, and people simply have more money to spend, but I haven’t seen a single person in my calls or at the desk say “oh maybe I’ll wait until next year”. No. They buy NOW because they are afraid the cost will keep going up.

HK offering prospectus. Page 25 talks about the VIE structure.

BABA first IPO'd on the NYSE in 2014. It did its secondary on HKEX in 2019. Same VIE structure, same Cayman Islands holding company.

China uses VIE structure to prevent foreign ownership. Any foreigner can buy off Hong Kong exchange. Use your brain.

And most importantly, BABA shares on NYSE are fully fungible towards HKEX shares. If they were not equal, this would not be the case. One BABA share can be exchanged for eight 9988 shares.

You are the one talking out of your ass."
2021-06-05 10:52:32,stocks,"Just because you can exchange BABA for 9988 doesn’t mean that they are the same thing. They confer different types of ownership.

If you hold BABA, you don’t have any legal ownership until you convert it to 9988. Look it up. Seriously I encourage you. Look it up.

Ability to convert doesn’t confer ownership. I can also convert my USD to 9988 that doesn’t mean I own Alibaba because it’s convertible. Lmao"
2021-06-05 12:04:02,stocks,"The prospectus linked above states the HK shares have the VIE structure. 

Why are you evading the point I made about any foreigner buying shares from HK? So all I have to do as an American, is open an IB brokerage account, buy HK shares, and now I'm an owner? Wow! I just evaded the CCP!
 
Again use your brain, if anything you said had any iota of truth, the HK shares would be trading at a stark premium to the NYSE shares. They aren't.

You can't convert dollars to HK shares genius, just like you can't convert dollars for a Big Mac. You can buy both. But with NYSE and HK BABA shares, there is a process where you contact your brokerage, pay commission and a ~ $500 fee, and they will convert."

Again, I'm a foreigner, I buy 9988 shares which you claim gives ownership rights. I now am a foreign owner of BABA and have gotten around China's struct rules against foreign ownership. Was it that easy? The CCP leadership must be idiots!

Instead of arguing like a child, just admit you are wrong and are an imbecile about this matter. Again, if what you believe was true, HK shares would trade at a stark premium to NYSE shares. Everyone who could, would just buy the HK shares.
My main broker is IB. I would just sell BABA and buy 9988. I don't because they are the same thing.

I am wasting no more time on this stupidity. Later."
2021-06-05 14:56:15,stocks,"I have idiocy? I wonder if it’s contagious.

Perhaps your second hand English is to blame for not understand the difference. And not, they wouldn’t be at a stark premium people the majority of the worlds money is in USD, and most people do not want to invest in foreign currencies besides USD. Which is why it’s the global reserve currency. 

Have yourself a read: Or better yet Google for yourself the “difference between BABA and 9988” 

“When you purchase the 9988 stock on the HKEX, you have a direct ownership in the Alibaba Group.

However, things are quite different for the BABA stock. When you buy the BABA stock, you are buying into an American Depositary Receipt (ADR).”

https://www.thefipharmacist.com/baba-vs-9988/#the-difference-between-baba-and-9988

They will all say a variation of this. One confers ownership of limited voting shares, one only holds right to profits. The ability to exchange one for the other, does not mean holding BABA confers ownership until it’s exchanged to 9988."
2021-06-05 15:39:28,stocks,"I congratulate you. You are easily the dumbest person on an investment forum I have talked to who is not trolling.

So now your argument is people rather invest in NYSE shares with ""no ownership"" and a convoluted VIE structure because the USD is the reserve currency?

How do you even function in this world without parents to guide you?

Einstein, the Yuan is pegged to the dollar so forex fluctuations are not even an issue. Second, when I invest in Indian stocks with a depreciating currency as an example, I simply hedge in the forex or forex futures mkts (bought $BSE index and short rupees). 


The phifarmacist? Don't make me laugh. I once read a motley fool article which said the same thing. Like I said, the amount of misinformation on BABA is astounding. I linked the HK prospectus for you that answered the question. Case closed.

So is Munger invested in HK shares because he wants ""ownership"", or is he invested in NYSE shares bc he can't trust the Yuan? 

Too funny.

Forex fluctuations? I wasn’t talking about any currency fluctuation concerns. You said if it were the case that one conferred ownership and the other didn’t, there would be a large disparity in the price. I’m explaining to you that there wouldn’t be and there isn’t because no one wants to buy anything in the Yuan. The majority of people invest in their local currency and USD only. Im not talking about Muger or anyone else. It’s just what most people do. Invest in their local  market and the US market. The majority of people don’t give a fuck about a small legal benefit on a fungible stock, when it means they’ll have to convert currency and pay exchange fees. Hence, the lack of a large price discrepancy. 

I’m going to assume you’re ESL status as being the fault for your lack of understanding, and inability to form a coherent argument on the matter.

You’re only evidence has been, since it’s fungible it is effectively the same. However until conversion is made, the difference remains."

Does it mean if I buy this contract,

1. I will have to pay 5.05\*100 = $505 now on a bet that MSFT will be above $390 on 16/06/2023?
2. And if the above is true on that date (MSFT > $390) then I can buy those 100 shares for today's price of $250?
3. And if the above is not true on that date (MSFT < $390) then I lose all my money ($505) but that's about it?"
2021-06-05 09:48:56,stocks,"Okay bear in mind that I'm still new at this and not the best candidate to guide you or teach others. Have you joined r/options? The folks there are friendly and helpful. I'm not exactly sure what the 5.05 open and 5.44 close indicates. The strike of 390 is obvious as that's your target and from there the price you pay is somewhere between the bid and ask, $5 - $7 per contract, I believe. When you draw up your contract you want to you'll want to offer somewhere down the middle and see if someone bites. I would start at $6 (down the middle) and modify it higher until someone buys it.  
    
This contract would lock in todays price of $250 per, I think yes.  

As far as losing all your money if you do not hit your target, this is highly unlikely I believe. The only way you lose all your money on LEAPS is if the stock goes to zero. It will depreciate greatly if the price goes lower and as theta (time) decays and gets closer to close.

I haven't dabbled in covered calls even though they can generate revenue while your longs or LEAPS mature.

You won’t regret it. Talks about how US brokers are able to list Chinese companies on the US Stock Exchange through a reverse merger with a dormant but still legally licensed US business.

They then fudge all of the numbers in public filings and make it look legit, but if you go there (the guys in the documentary did) you’ll realize they aren’t doing hundreds of millions in business, in fact they aren’t doing any at all.

The US brokers orchestrate the entire thing, pump the stock like crazy then dump it and the company never actually does anything.
