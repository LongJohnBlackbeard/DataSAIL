2021-06-20 19:29:16,wallstreetbets,I’d bet anything that passenger days goes back to peak levels.  Cruises have always been the cheapest way for people to go on a boozy vacation bc inherently the “real estate” is cheap
2021-06-20 19:41:59,wallstreetbets,Like it and already aboard.
2021-06-20 19:46:47,wallstreetbets,Thing is Norwegian ships are garbage compared to $RCL
2021-06-20 19:25:53,wallstreetbets,I’m holding long on NCLH
2021-06-20 19:48:45,wallstreetbets,"Then go RCL, they’re a great bet too. Comes down to the math of the trade. You’re going to get nearly the same percentage return, but the  RCL trade will cost you more. It might make sense if you’re going very long, but even that’s unclear."
2021-06-20 19:40:19,wallstreetbets,"So it’s asking *what* you are holding. So a link to your position screenshot would be good. 

You could post to your profile and add a link with what the position is."
2021-06-20 19:49:51,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the clarification. So I need to post that, or they’ll take this down? Also, are you saying to make my profile pic into the screenshot of my position? Thanks again!"

2021-06-20 18:25:18,wallstreetbets,"For whatever reason it took until a few months ago for stocks to become sports teams. Now we've got stock-specific subreddits shitting up the conversation anywhere they feel like they're not catered to enough and coordinating low quality posting and re-hashing for ""awareness"", then getting angry and complaining when it's removed.

Try to remember the above chart the next time someone sells you some bullshit about how we hate their stock and how we're biased.

EDIT: If anyone wants me to run any queries, just ask."

2021-06-20 18:34:27,wallstreetbets,My take away from this is that more DD needs to be deleted across the board.
2021-06-20 18:27:51,wallstreetbets,"Shitty legend. Should have had labels for ""approved"" and ""not approved"". Now these retarded apes are going to reeeee their bananas into the sky arguing over what parts of the DD were considered False or True. Those savages know nothing of booleans."
2021-06-20 18:52:35,wallstreetbets,It really humanizes the (gay) mods knowing they hate this bullshit whining as much as us plebes.

2021-06-20 19:29:58,wallstreetbets,"The fact that this has to be done means that we are going downhill. There shouldn't be a need to bolster many dds daily to encourage people to move into a position. 

I know we have so many bagholders waiting for the opportunity to breakeven and sell their positions but I beleive that once a dd is posted if it doesn't gain a certain about of upvotes or awards then it should be purged. Same goes with comments on that certain thread. 

Blackberry is a long term play but you fuckers felt that it would be the next amc by pumping up the volume."
2021-06-20 18:54:36,wallstreetbets,I am a CLOV holder and I’m getting real tired of the Whiny and complaining by my fellow CLOVs. After seeing this data no one should speak out about getting treated unfairly… numbers don’t lie. Now we all need to stop complaining and focus on our investments.

2021-06-20 19:22:49,wallstreetbets,Probably because they're annoyed with the trend of people putting emotional investment in a stock over financial investment in a stock and taking it out on us. I'd guess the context is someone hassling them about some grievance.

2021-06-20 18:42:15,wallstreetbets,Not soon but someday.
2021-06-20 18:02:18,wallstreetbets,"Soon, probably not. However, you have yourself a nice long term hold. Should double over next 3-5 years."
2021-06-20 19:15:13,wallstreetbets,I’m in it fir the next 3-4 years
2021-06-20 18:46:03,wallstreetbets,26 eow ape
2021-06-20 18:54:38,wallstreetbets,Should have done that when it was $20
2021-06-20 18:01:48,wallstreetbets,"Bro what made you think pltr would double soon? Not saying it won’t go up, it’s just that there are much better long term plays rn. *cough* WISH"
2021-06-20 18:55:06,wallstreetbets,"If by ""bumpy"" you mean ""hovers between $20-$24.99 without doing anything"" then ok"
2021-06-20 19:08:13,wallstreetbets,what makes you think it’s a long term play? thinking of joining PLTR gang myself

2021-06-20 19:30:40,wallstreetbets,"I’ll be honest, I’m surprised she hasn’t taken off already. I’ve been burned on a few PLTR calls, but I KNOW they’re legit and headed for big things. My entries were just poorly timed. So I started thinking, okay so maybe it’s a long term play, maybe LEAPS. I’m a novice and trying to learn charting, so for me LEAPS kind of hedge against my ignorance, giving me as much Theta as I can possibly get lol."
2021-06-20 19:14:07,wallstreetbets,A lot of stocks IPOd and gone up like that….
2021-06-20 19:41:00,wallstreetbets,I have a 300 shares and a $30 call for January I’m feeling pretty good about right now. Love PLTR.
2021-06-20 19:48:11,wallstreetbets,Desktop Metal DM is using single pass binder jetting to move 3D printing into mass production for Metal Parts. They also acquired Envisiontec and work in medical and dental polymer printing. It's oversold and will probably run up in Q3 with the release of the production system. Currently holding shares and calls. It's a major step in shoring up supply chains and a big push in 4th industrial revolution tech.
2021-06-20 18:16:02,wallstreetbets,3D printing is too slow and expensive for most everything except bespoke manufacturing.
2021-06-20 18:41:21,wallstreetbets,"Nondenominational, NNMD."
2021-06-20 18:42:52,wallstreetbets,This was great 5 yrs ago
2021-06-20 19:46:52,wallstreetbets,Sounds like these supply chain issues are an opportunity for PLTR to show its big dicc energy 🍆⚡️
2021-06-20 19:50:25,wallstreetbets,"Maybe actually research 3d printing. Hell, buy yourself a cheap printer to see what it's really like. There are a lot of things 3d printing is good at, uniquely suited to, and absolutely atrocious at. 3d printing will never out perform injection molding in mass production / commodity type items. Sure if there's a complete disruption in supply chain,  but at that point what about filament to run the printers or even electricity?"
2021-06-20 18:43:45,wallstreetbets,I have roughly 26k in NNMD. To the fucking moon 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

2021-06-20 17:24:59,wallstreetbets,Definitely no.
2021-06-20 18:10:46,wallstreetbets,I think it's going to go back up. The fed said basically nothing is changing for a year and a report said retail stores did a little worse..
2021-06-20 19:20:52,wallstreetbets,lettttsssssss goooooooo!!!!!!!

2021-06-20 18:29:36,wallstreetbets,Lmfaoo y’all mfs dumb if you think we will be red again on Monday. Congrats on the dub
2021-06-20 19:15:36,wallstreetbets,$305 this week. Won’t see $420 again for several weeks.
2021-06-20 18:14:38,wallstreetbets,T+2 after quadwitch. Tuesday or Wednesday looking good for my spy puts
2021-06-20 18:33:20,wallstreetbets,It will likely be red for the rest of the month. Puts should pay off nicely.
2021-06-20 17:43:25,wallstreetbets,$ATH by eom then fucked after that.
2021-06-20 19:48:50,wallstreetbets,"Also, no. Maybe in a few weeks."
2021-06-20 17:25:24,wallstreetbets,Agreed. Puts will pay. $408 by Wednesday.

2021-06-20 17:21:39,wallstreetbets,This is disgusting reporting. The SEC is complicit in entirely screwing up the market and turning a blind eye against the broken system engineered to undermine the public investor.
2021-06-20 17:39:13,wallstreetbets,"I don't get it. Trading doesn't rely on fundamentals, it relies on chart patterns. The people who are in meme stocks are trading, not investing."
2021-06-20 18:09:38,wallstreetbets,Published by CNBC?  Total FUD.  The SEC does have power over naked shorting.  They need to step up and save the stock market from blatant manipulation.  Preferably before the entire world figures out how rigged the system is in a country and market that's suppose to be free.  NOT SELLING UNTIL THEY COVER.
2021-06-20 18:26:37,wallstreetbets,"> Buffett hasn’t noted in his criticisms of the “casino” atmosphere of this bull market and companies like Robinhood, which he has thoroughly beat on…

2021-06-20 17:18:52,wallstreetbets,"I hope to turn it around like you did. I made the best call option trade of my investing career with BB. I bought 40 LEAPS for 2k in March. Sold them about 3 weeks ago for 24k. Then just last week my dumb ass got greedy and brave. I bought 900 calls of CLNE. And for some dumb reason I picked the 6/18 expiration. Idk why I didn’t do leaps like I’ve always done before. To make a long story short, all those BB gains vanished in the blink of an eye. I’ll get back on track and back in the green side of options. Congrats and thanks for the pick me up."

I working too hard at climbing back up out of an idiot hole I dug myself last year. I know how you feel. Cheers and good luck! Should be a good 2nd half of this year."
2021-06-20 18:59:09,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the post! Enjoyed reading it 👍 I too have been on quite the gain / loss journey over the past year or so also. Decided to follow to see where your next trades take you I also agree wish seems way oversold even without everyone here trying to pump it.Good luck!
2021-06-20 17:05:51,wallstreetbets,"I am pretty sure you will be at around 200k by end of this year with your current position. Well done.
Last but not least, congrats and $WISH you 🚀🚀🚀🚀"
2021-06-20 17:00:37,wallstreetbets,"Oh yeah nicely done 👏🏻 
Fuck you and congrats."
2021-06-20 17:41:50,wallstreetbets,"Early on when I first started trading, I took shots on weeklies and monthlies.  It almost never worked out, and the money disappeared fast.  I generally try to stick to LEAPs myself now, and part of the reason I sold too early on the TSLA puts and PFE calls was because I broke that personal rule and started to feel the pressure of theta and IV decay, ultimately causing me to chicken out and sell.

I'm back to trying to stick to LEAPs, but for my WISH position, when I initially bought in at least, Jan. 2022 was the furthest available so I was forced to break the rule again to take the position.  I could roll them out now, since I think Dec. 2022 is available now, but I'm feeling a little too confident about the play, and I always feel like I lose to the spread when I roll options out....  Hopefully I'm not about to head back down for breaking my own rules again.

Good luck man.  It sounds like you just lost the gains and not the main account, so you hopefully still have a good launching point."
2021-06-20 18:10:00,wallstreetbets,"Whoa, are you like okay?"
2021-06-20 19:41:21,wallstreetbets,"Thanks, you too"
2021-06-20 17:43:02,wallstreetbets,Cheers and good luck to you as well!
2021-06-20 19:45:56,wallstreetbets,"Thanks, you too.  I'm sure I'll do another update eventually... Hopefully one of them will eventually be ""Well, WSB, I've just retired..."""
2021-06-20 17:48:37,wallstreetbets,"My buddy made a joke and said I needed to tattoo a frog somewhere on me to remember to do leaps only lol. Maybe you need one also haha. But yeah it was only my most recent gains. I had plans to put it all into MVIS leaps but saw all the CLNE talk and dove in. But I also had a selling too early screw up in the GME saga. I had a 60$ call option I bought for $2k. I panic sold when it went from $115 to 65$. I made $900 still. But that same call was worth $27k two days later lol. I was like you’ve got to be kidding me. I was upset, but it was green and I didn’t lose anything. Are you buying OTM Leaps or ITM leaps for WISH?"
2021-06-20 18:19:55,wallstreetbets,"Haha, yeah, the tattoo might not be a bad idea.  If I lose my money a third time... Might consider it as punishment, lol.

I've got 20 x $10 calls and 60 x $15 for WISH.  I almost always buy slightly OTM and plan to sell those $10 calls on a good spike (10-15%) and just hold the $15 for a while."
2021-06-20 18:23:09,wallstreetbets,Smart play. I do a couple ITM like that and the rest I go far OTM. Usually the farthest out. I chose $40 leaps for BB and they went from $52 each to $600+. These WISH leaps I planned on getting anyway I may do a few ITM some barely OTM then the rest far OTM. I wish you well and hope you strike an early retirement this year or the next. Thanks again for the confidence booster.
2021-06-20 19:37:28,wallstreetbets,"Thanks man.  A word of caution on the far OTM options... I used to do that, too, until I started having problems in low volume/low liquidity stocks with selling them.  Don't recommend it unless you're in a highly liquid stock... And even then, if the stock moves the wrong way, you could end up with no one to sell them to.

That said, if the stock moves the right way, you can make millions.

Good luck!"

2021-06-20 16:31:27,wallstreetbets,The idea that Coca Cola might never recover from this is incomprehensible to me. My reasoning is that nobody in the world would expect that a health nut like Ronaldo drinks coca cola + everybody everywhere likes coca cola products.

I don't live anywhere near Atlanta, but this low is probably still the political aftermath of the last election and the dividing lines everyone is still choosing. 

I can't help but wonder if the soccer snub is related, or more of an endorsement thing lol

Short term if that's the reason a stock drops BUY BUY BUY because people have short attention span. KO will recover because people will forget. Long term I think KO will alright as a long term dividend stock, don't see any growth in KO. Long as they don't drop the div a dip is a good thing."

2021-06-20 16:54:40,wallstreetbets,"32 bucks KO last year or 2020 spring. Something like that. Ridiculous to think KO went down because of Ronaldo. I would believe it if it was Leo Messi who did that but not Ronaldo. Nope KO is just solid. Only thing would be rising commodities such as oil, aluminum, transportation etc that would affect KO."
2021-06-20 17:02:00,wallstreetbets,"I always thought these sponsorships were very misleading. The thought of people believing these top athletes are drinking not just coke but things like monster mind boggles me. If people are dumb enough to believe that, it’s almost like maybe they need to put in some kind of laws considering the stuff is like poison."
2021-06-20 17:44:53,wallstreetbets,Not like Coke/Blackrock/Vanguard doesn't own every single other drink on the market either.

Can anyone explain this?"
2021-06-20 17:18:24,wallstreetbets,"Alcohol is a lot worse, You also learn about it in school. Every body knows what alcohol is and to be cautious with it. Parents are dumb and pumps sodas in their kids and the kids grow up unhealthy because of a diet that they think is normal."

Because I don’t think kids give a fuck. All they want is to drink. But please tell me more about coke being worse because we don’t educate the kids how bad it is. Turns out no one cares if shit is bad for them. Or there wouldn’t be lines around the building at every fast food joint"
2021-06-20 17:04:05,wallstreetbets,"I brought up an good sized drop in sales as the explanation for lower stock price and if you don't think politics affects stocks then you should go 100% all in on north Korean businesses.

And why are you idiots trying to continue the political debate? I'm not. I don't give a shit what you think. Your comments broadcast to me that you aren't worth the conversation. 

I was merely relaying what I understand has affected their bottom line. I think whether it's true or not, Coke will recover because they are the biggest, they are everywhere, and people have short attention spans and the calls for boycott will be short lived.

I am not focusing on politics. You and another idiot just can't help yourselves from pushing it though. And since I know I don't care what you think, I'm not going to debate you.

You're pretty pathetic. But keep going, cuz it's so sad I'm amused by your insignificant comments.

2021-06-20 18:37:25,wallstreetbets,"God, watching you make a fool of yourself is fun. I don't have any proof of voter fraud. Why would I have proof?

2021-06-20 17:28:55,wallstreetbets,"Keep an eye on my WISH all-in. Got a feeling it's gonna rip pretty hard. If it jumps the way it did a couple weeks ago, I'll set stop-losses to chase its rise and try to ride it up. Reasonable chance we see the price spike and then correct lower, so I'm going to try to time selling higher than the price it corrects down to and then buying back in when it goes back under what I sold it at (if it ever does) to try to pick up some more shares.   


Worst case scenario, assuming the stock doesn't tank right out the gate for some reason, I'm out a bunch of profit but do still end up profiting (it rips, then fluctuates just under my stop loss, then rips again), which I'm fine with. Best case scenario I can increase profit and/or average down if it corrects back under my current price average (about 11.32).   


If WISH tanks, I guess I'll just be chilling all day. Would be surprised if that happens, given the amount of attention being paid to the stock right now, but it's certainly possible."

I'm seeing a very concerted effort over the past week by various talking heads that are in essence trying to put fear into the small investor who likes the idea of investing in the meme stocks, excuse me stonks, telling them that this is just a flash in the pan and everything being done is done wrong and they're all going to lose all their money If they dare invest other than with the traditional methods.

It's time to change how the stock market works, and small investors putting their money into things that they believe in not just things that have been around for a hundred years. For example I would never invest in altria, (MO) because I don't support people who conspired for decades to addict people to cigarettes, and then to Juul. 
God forbid, ethics on this subreddit. I apologize profusely.

But I think investing in things you believe in could change how this whole rotten system works. I know, I'm a hopeless optimist. No need to try to drag me down to earth. But we have seen how the little guy can change the face of a bastion."

Money and sex are covered behind the Wendy’s dumpster.

Friends? Well, the other people working behind the dumpster.

Intelligent Entrepreneurship? You guessed it, charging for BJs behind the dumpster.

Creating a change in the world? I mean, spreading herpes changes a lot of lives. Coincidentally working behind the dumpster let’s me do that too.

Fuck. Seems like my happiness is defined by being behind the Wendy’s dumpster…. That’s gonna take a while to process."

No, because that was after the 1:12 reverse split (or do thea numbers go the other way, I'm retarded and don't know) so looking at the price history today that's like coming in at about $20 and not selling when it hit $120, then selling at a 50% loss at $10."

2021-06-20 18:56:51,wallstreetbets,"TL:DR - $1,500 before quarter-end."
2021-06-20 17:05:41,wallstreetbets,So TSLA to 3 trillion confirmed?
2021-06-20 15:45:26,wallstreetbets,i dont usually look at fortune telling type shit like this - but i thought it was really interesting and uncanny how similar the patterns are
2021-06-20 19:30:29,wallstreetbets,It looks like a dinosaur
2021-06-20 18:12:08,wallstreetbets,"thanks, gonna load up calls tomorrow"
2021-06-20 17:21:47,wallstreetbets,So with 2 days closing above the 200 day sma it’s either test the 50 day sma line or drop. To crazy for my money to predict but I’ll follow what the volume And direction dictates 👍
2021-06-20 19:10:14,wallstreetbets,Can anyone explain the psychology behind this to an idiot ape?
2021-06-20 17:37:05,wallstreetbets,Those are called fractals and the next one will be even bigger because it's going to be the FOURTH FRACTAL. Pay attention.
2021-06-20 19:00:11,wallstreetbets,can you tell about those mountains in the right side? some sort of a volume or pls explain.
2021-06-20 16:15:06,wallstreetbets,Extremely bullish on tsla might even hit 900 next earnings
2021-06-20 15:52:30,wallstreetbets,Looks like a sell out coming
2021-06-20 17:11:54,wallstreetbets,Please tsla moon!
2021-06-20 18:11:13,wallstreetbets,Burry in shambles
2021-06-20 15:45:13,wallstreetbets,I saw something I didn't like in here but the user is approved so I ignored it. /u/zjz
2021-06-20 18:31:04,wallstreetbets,Yes I saw the big blobs and wanted to circle them in paint. It means something important. I need to do more Direct Damage research and look at the 0-60 and quarter mile times. That will tell me if it's a buy.
2021-06-20 18:29:45,wallstreetbets,"What this shows is that the gains in the stock market are being driven by more money being put in stocks than in other things.  Tesla is hovering around new equilibrium price levels with each subsequent pump of new money into the financial system.

It's a direct consequence of QE during the pandemic.  Which is basically over now, so it will not happen again.

It'll probably drop another 30-50% as the emergency measures are withdrawn because everyone will flee for the exits to take profits."
2021-06-20 16:30:08,wallstreetbets,"Cool example of a random variable displaying self similarity, and that’s all. Not predictive whatsoever"
2021-06-20 16:36:09,wallstreetbets,Looks a bit cloudy to me..
2021-06-20 19:07:13,wallstreetbets,Look closer actually. Last one is descending triangle while first 2 are symmetrical ones. I think we get a head fake before heading to 400s
2021-06-20 17:01:51,wallstreetbets,What do you expect a chart to look like after a 700% surge in 6 months?
2021-06-20 16:02:02,wallstreetbets,Probably going up
2021-06-20 16:48:32,wallstreetbets,down to 400 by next year?
2021-06-20 18:03:38,wallstreetbets,Too much competition but i never bet against a trend
2021-06-20 17:11:34,wallstreetbets,Looking like a bullish falling wedge pattern to me...
2021-06-20 19:16:56,wallstreetbets,what blue circle mean?

2021-06-20 16:30:55,wallstreetbets,It's not even close to the same pattern.
2021-06-20 17:45:39,wallstreetbets,What is puts? Is it abriviation 2 profits

For my friends is like what if Elon Musk is using star-link to find the exact formula to find the highest probable play  in order to complete some end goal. Hence the tweets that don't make any sense, the TV appearances. Bad publicity is publicity I've noticed that he'll lower his own stock right before the ticker dates in order to make the charts seem more bullish before or after an event or some company boost. He just throws it all back in. He made $29,000 at the end of 2018. The second below him made some 1.3 million.

2021-06-20 16:32:00,wallstreetbets,I never said it was predictive - and I agree completely - I just thought it was interesting
2021-06-20 19:11:17,wallstreetbets,"I saw that too, although technically its a symmetrical triangle since we made a higher low.

I definitely thing this is an amazing short setup below 539"

I did sell 1 share of it on Friday as it kept hitting new all time highs, I think it might have a short term pullback before going higher, if not pullback at 400 before breaking thru that level. 

Many analysts rate it around 420-475"

We've seen some upheaval in recent trends, but have we had a true shift in momentum/sector rotation or just some churn due to surprised Fed guidance and a large Opex?  
I think we need some time to tell, but it's important to understand what just happened and what to be looking at going forward in order to stay abreast of the market."

This is not financial advice but I'm bullish on their Q2 earnings. My wife's boyfriend has failed to factor in the huge cash payouts they received this quarter from Samsung Licensing deal and Lenovo patent dispute settlement.

Unfortunately didn’t profit hugely from the move last week (all out at 38.50), but made good money nonetheless and I’ve slowly started accumulating again on Friday. Unless there’s a major correction, $30-31 should once again hold as support."
2021-06-20 14:57:36,wallstreetbets,Nah I'm feeling good on this one $37 eom
2021-06-20 18:49:06,wallstreetbets,What if you’re planning on retiring next month?
2021-06-20 18:35:46,wallstreetbets,"Remember how they say "" It can't possibly go any lower""?"
2021-06-20 16:02:54,wallstreetbets,Yep it was the same story when we were collecting profits last week. You know what I mean. Hold your bag though because that bag is full of money!!!
2021-06-20 16:15:03,wallstreetbets,You know your stuff bro. I never get into anything that recently had a WSB run but this is a quality company you’re buying into.
2021-06-20 14:24:38,wallstreetbets,Smart man! Profit is profit. I’m not looking for jackpots anymore just good gains slowly but consistently
2021-06-20 19:34:28,wallstreetbets,Mmmmm good question.
2021-06-20 18:43:59,wallstreetbets,"I said it seemed unlikely, there's risk in everything, obviously, but look at where you are.

FWIW I've been using ultimate oscillator on daily time base to swing crsr for a good few months because it pretty much perfectly lines up with the top and bottom prices for this stock and Friday looked like the bottom to me too, I added another 380 shares at about 31.8.

I honestly think crsr is an amazing play right now, steam and twitch numbers just keep going up month on month despite it being the summer of covid freedom. It trades at 1.5x forward sales and 10x forward p/e which is amazing for a company projecting 30%+ growth for this year. Plus their product mix continuing to shift more towards peripherals and non memory components will continue to give them improvement margins on that revenue this year.

They've paid down a lot of debt, eagletree barely has a majority stake anymore which were two of the negatives for me.

I can't make people buy it but uh, I think they'll be sorry they didn't sometime this year."
2021-06-20 16:04:43,wallstreetbets,"Made $16,000 on calls. Lost $8,000 chasing, still put 8k into more shares and happy to hold until people stop sleeping on it. DDR5 cycle means corsairs in for a couple great years"
2021-06-20 16:19:42,wallstreetbets,"Haha I agree with you completely man. Usually I avoid meme stocks  but this one is actually a strong financial company, they just happen to be right this time. Goodluck out there! May we all get gains"
2021-06-20 15:59:09,wallstreetbets,Profit is profit. I wish everybody understood this.
2021-06-20 14:28:49,wallstreetbets,"Wait, isn't that the antithesis of WSB?"
2021-06-20 18:51:47,wallstreetbets,"I'm not saying don't buy it sometime this year, but IMO, observe that in the big picture it is still on a slight downtrend."
2021-06-20 16:07:38,wallstreetbets,"I’m glad for you. I didn’t think it will move after the February run so I skipped this round. It’s a great long term investment, that’s not really what I’m into though. I like the get while the getting is good."
2021-06-20 14:31:58,wallstreetbets,Haha true. I’ve blown up my accounts too many times. I gotta build it back up then I can make other big financial mistakes 😉 gotta fund my degenerate gambling somehow
2021-06-20 17:06:07,wallstreetbets,"WSB has had a ton of changes to perspective over the last 6-7 months, what is WSB really about any longer?"
2021-06-20 18:55:21,wallstreetbets,"Not seeing it, I'm just seeing a low volume bottom before last earnings, an uptick in volume after and a few semi breakouts over the last month that are getting bigger. Looks primed for a big move to me, but that's the fun of the game, you pays your money and you takes your chances."
2021-06-20 14:39:31,wallstreetbets,How did you lost money? Options?
2021-06-20 17:51:12,wallstreetbets,Aggressive plays. Saying it has to be options is stupid.
2021-06-20 19:00:08,wallstreetbets,"I'd say you need to zoom out to the 5 day and 1 month to see it. It's not ""flat"" .  Looking at moving average, OBV, and MACD."
2021-06-20 17:50:37,wallstreetbets,He got fined by grammar nazis.
2021-06-20 16:49:17,wallstreetbets,He’s not going to respond
2021-06-20 19:01:00,wallstreetbets,I'm looking at the chart from start of march when I'm talking about this.
2021-06-20 19:30:48,wallstreetbets,You're going to see what you want to see then. Enough said.
2021-06-20 19:31:32,wallstreetbets,What a waste of time.
2021-06-20 19:49:27,wallstreetbets,"I mean, if you didn't learn anything from it, yes, a total waste of time. You have to understand, that as a share owner, you are looking for confirmation bias. 

I don't own CRSR, so I don't have a horse in this race. If I saw that it was a perfect entry, I would change my mind. 

But you do you."
2021-06-20 19:51:08,wallstreetbets,"I spent plenty of time explaining my thoughts which you were completely unwilling to entertain either. I think you're projecting.

I also think you're a condescending asshat, blocking you you now."
2021-06-20 19:53:01,wallstreetbets,What did you pay for $AMD?

I pay the lowest amounts I can on my student loans and have for 10 years. The amount of money I can make using my capital returns a much higher percentage that I pay in debt servicing. All of my remaining student debt (which is substantial) is consolidated with the federal government.  I have also been banking for a very long time that the government was going to eventually be forced to assume a large part of student loan debt. We came close with Bernie Sanders, but failed.  I still think there will be a student debt jubilee at some point (perhaps just via hyperinflation).

I am indeed a smooth brain, but here's a DD I wrote on my thesis: [Inflation, Commodities Supercycles & Broken Supply Chains: Why macroeconomic conditions have aligned to make $CLF America’s number 1 steel company (and perhaps trigger a short squeeze in the process!)](https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n5g8ng/inflation_commodities_supercycles_broken_supply/?).

2021-06-20 12:57:30,wallstreetbets,"Stock market maybe but oil will be through the roof. Canceled pipeline, environmental protection issues, inflation, and increased demand."
2021-06-20 14:07:12,wallstreetbets,A person who commented on a similar post said it best. 🌈🐻s have predicted 12 of the last 3 corrections.
2021-06-20 15:06:50,wallstreetbets,"Dude, you’re a clown.  It is an absolute perfect storm for an oil commodity Supercycle. Lower supply due to lack of investment and government interference, combined with the weakening dollar and inflation is going to send oil through the roof. This EV dream is years away and in the meantime, people still need their gas, plastic bags, jet fuel, synthetics, etc."

2021-06-20 13:44:47,wallstreetbets,"Imagine if you are one of the oil producing countries.  You know that in the near future, people will be switching to drive electric vehicles.  Would you not increase oil price now while most vehicles still rely on your oil supply?  This is the last chance to convert your natural resource to money to feed your country.  The higher the price of oil, the sooner people will be replacing their gasoline car to electric car - probably will take a decade.... don't expect cheap gasoline during this time."

2021-06-20 16:14:27,wallstreetbets,"I’m big bear too but let me play devils advocate for a moment. What if this “everything bubble” isn’t really anything more than than a decline in fiat. Note that I didn’t say the dollar, the dollar is relative to other currencies but most countries printed a ton of cash. So if everyone just increased their money supply and handed out a shit ton of it to everyone, wouldn’t it stand to reason that the cost of everything would just go up to compensate? Is the S&P overvalued compared to anything else except fiat money? No, not really b/c EVERYTHING is up. So maybe everything is fine and we just have to accept that egg McMuffins are $6 each and Honda Civics are now $35k or whatever. This all could be a fiat money crash, not an everything bubble."

2021-06-20 14:11:01,wallstreetbets,"Interesting take, you make a lot of good points. Here's my opinion. I'm an uneducated student of life that knows nothing. Here goes: 

We have seen unexpected growth since the great recession. Ppl have been predicting a crash/recession for the past 5 years at least. We saw a major crash and rebound in 2020, we've seen mostly unexpected growth in housing and jobs/pay are a subject talked about like never before in my 40 years. 

I see explosive and unpredictable growth for the next 8-10 years before we hit a recession. Roaring 20s 2.0. I'm planning on building cash in the markets until 2028 or so, then I'll gtfo. History repeats"
2021-06-20 12:55:41,wallstreetbets,"Agree with some disagree with some. The only thing that matters is what the Fed does. It’s the creator and destroyer of bubbles. They just took a trillion out of circulation by raising the reverse repo rate. If they want to deflate the bubble, they can jack that rate up 50 more bps without even touching the FFR. 

An additional complication is the fact that inflation helps the indebted and hurtled the creditor. The federal government is indebted up to its eyeballs and there are no plans to change. Why would they complicate that by unexpectedly raising rates?"

2021-06-20 13:49:23,wallstreetbets,"I would be very careful about any assumptions about market to GDP given a 40 year decline in interest rates. Historical comparisons are maybe good to see how much the market has moved from some mean, but assumptions about what is the correct market valuation have to factor in a zero or perhaps less than zero (if inflation is greater than interest rates) risk-free rate of return."

-CLNE volume is WAY up and its trending on WSB but the price has only just started to move so its not too late to get in

-AMC and GME are trading sideways (boring) and have less upside potential now. People are looking for the next ticker to moon

-Mods finally cleaned up the pump and dump bot spam so people looking to repeat AMC level gains aren’t split into 18 different shit tickers

Bottom line is everyone wants to be in the next stock that moons. I think it will be CLINE

2021-06-20 13:11:56,wallstreetbets,Hard to pump up clne with a half a bil float. Def different from crsr imo. People don’t really have the same affinity for it as crsr. We actually memed crsr a long time ago in the past.
2021-06-20 16:10:54,wallstreetbets,CLNE is so obviously pump n dump bot spam.  The top comments in this very post are all from accounts that ONLY post about CLNE and do so with new submissions daily!  It's so fricking obvious

2021-06-20 13:16:55,wallstreetbets,I mean the market cap is only 2 billion dollars. Apes have held AMC at 30 billion for 2 weeks. People didn’t have affinity for AMC either when GME was pumped. Right now in the present time I totally agree with you but CLNE is gaining momentum. Better to get in now than to FOMO in later. But that’s just my retarded opinion.

2021-06-20 18:16:31,wallstreetbets,I make comments on stocks that I own and understand.  Not sure why this is an issue considering this discussion is centered around CLNE.

2021-06-20 19:18:08,wallstreetbets,Yeah except even if a good company is pumped and dumped it returns to normal levels after the fact. Which for CLNE is what 9-10$ which returns it to undervalued... meaning after it's dumped it will be bought up again.

But we can be grateful for those who have stepped up and done their best in our lives for us.  And most importantly, we can choose to be the best dads ourselves for all the kids out there."

2021-06-20 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Hemp Investment Business Model some guys i know if Florida ex delta force has a licence to grow hemp and currently looking for investors to purchase the land to start growing with a group of disabled Veterans this is isnt the purpose of this post though just looking for feedback on the investment model we were looking at.

The Model would be some thing along the lines of the investor rather than buying shares would buy an allocation of crop/pots in the greenhouse the company would then seed/plant a clone in the pots, maintain them, harvest them then process the plants and find buyers for the fibres/cbd oil. 

a deduction would be made for costs associated with this then the investor would receive the balance of the crop allocation on a qauterly basis as their investment returns

intrested in opinions and views if its some thing people would invest in just looking for feed back."
2021-06-20 12:03:44,wallstreetbets,There’s barely any profit with hemp dude. Have you ever grown it before? Florida is a terrible climate for hemp also. The humidity will cause a lot of buds to mold. BAD BUSINESS INVESTMENT!
2021-06-20 12:08:49,wallstreetbets,"As a farmer and a veteran I like the idea but the problem with the US Hemp industry right now is that there is no infrastructure to sustain the acres currently grown. Hemp has many other applications other than CBD oil but there aren’t enough places that those who grow Hemp to sell their crop to. I personally know at least 10 farmers who went pretty much bankrupt growing hemp in the past couple years  because they couldn’t sell their crops. All of these individuals had contracts with various companies to buy their products but those companies themselves either didn’t fulfill their end of the contract or went bankrupt themselves. I think Hemp has a lot of potential in the future but we are still years away from having the infrastructure in place as well as the demand for the crop to be profitable for farmers to grow it. The bottom line is that this is something I would not invest in. The only way it could possibly be profitable is if they grew hemp to process their own brand of CBD oil and even then it is very risky. Aside from all of the land, machinery, and building cost, the cost of producing an acre of CBD hemp is $10k to $15k. A few acres of hemp will produce a lot of CBD oil. Furthermore a few acres wouldn’t sustain the cost of all the other overhead. They would have to have a pretty big distribution contract. Anyway, it’s very risky. You wouldn’t get a return on your investment for years. That’s assuming you get any return at all."
2021-06-20 12:07:16,wallstreetbets,Those licenses are over $50 mil and you have to have the land before you get licensed. There aren't many available.

2021-06-20 16:56:29,wallstreetbets,"Since selling off 1,900+ of their retail locations to Walgreens for $4.4 billion back in 2018, Rite Aid was able to reduce its debt to $3.1 billion.  That remaining debt is being serviced quite effectively.

Last year Rite Aid had positive free cash flow and more that $400 million in EBITDA, to go along with $24 billion in revenue. The company's financial health has improved so significantly, that earlier this year RAD completed a $95 million acquisition of Bartell Drugs, making Rite Aid the #1 retail pharmacy in Seattle. In addition, the company is investing about $200 million in store remodeling per year, which is improving results at each of the refurbished locations by about 3%. If Rite Aid had any concerns about its debt, it could direct the $300 million per year that it is spending in acquisitions and refurbishments to debt retirement.

As such, it appears that the $3.1 billion in long-term debt is being easily serviced by the company, and they’ve been paying down chunks of debt early from time to time.

This year, Rite Aid will turn the corner and have positive net earnings overall.  So the financial health of the company is now quite strong --- so strong, in fact that Moody's upgraded its rating on Rite Aid to POSITIVE from STABLE back on May 13, 2021.

On the topic of Amazon buying Rite Aid, there has indeed been a lot of speculation concerning this in the media lately, since AMZN was reported to be investigating the possibility of wanting to go to physical retail pharmacy stores as part of its healthcare strategy."

2021-06-20 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Wall Street Bets Guide to Options: Insiders Only! Volume I Options are the best way to make a lot of money with a minimal amount of risk.

This guide will help you get started on your path to financial freedom.

Some definitions:

**Calls:** Calls let you “call” your broker and tell them how much you want to pay for a stock. Say Tesla is trading at $700. You can call your broker and tell them you want to buy it at $300. If it’s a new broker that just passed his series 7 he might say something like, “Do you mean 300 strike sir/mam?” Calmy tell this noob that you know about options from WSB and want to talk to his manager. If they still wont let you participate in call options to purchase Tesla at $300, you will need to report this to FINRA. Here is their help line: Phone: (240) 386-HELP.

**Puts:** Puts, much like Calls are insider trading tools used by many Wall Street firms. How a put option works is that you call your brokerage and tell them your want to “put” or give back your shares for their original purchase price. Puts are what you use to get a refund if things went a little awry. Lets say you smooth brain bought GME at $440 after looking at shitty memes all day, tell your broker you would like to use a put option to get a refund. You choose the price, however, one firm rule of puts is that you cannot put your shares back for more than you paid for them. So, in this case, you can put your shares back into the share pool for $440 apiece.

**Covered Calls:** Covered calls are normally only for elite wall street veterans but I will help you trade just like they do. Selling calls should not be done over the phone with your brokerage. Don’t worry Robinhood traders this isn’t a problem for you. You are going to want to do this online after you sign your margin contract with your brokerage. Covered calls are a sale of the aforementioned call options where you essentially sell something you don’t own and make money for just knowing about this trick! Its like being able to sell your neighbors car without him knowing. Its really important when selling calls to not have the underlying stocks in your account. For example, if you want to sell covered calls on Tesla, do not purchase the security first. You dont want to get them called away do you!? Another quick tip: to maximize profit always look for the most volatile stocks possible, meme stocks are great for this. Remember, keep it online, just click the sell button, go a little bit out of the money (more on this below) and you will get the biggest bang for your buck!

**In the money:** ITM is how wall street traders congratulate each other on a successful call or put option. Lets say you used a put to return your shares for a refund, when the money hits your account, you can post it on WSB to let others know you are “in the money!” You will most likely be showered with awards from wall street bettors. Wall Street bettors are very nice folks who are there to support you. Its their way of saying welcome to the club! Here’s some gold. Also, be sure to let us know what brokerage you are using so we can transfer our 4 GME shares over there.

**Out of the money:** OTM refers to trading noobs who don’t know how to trade options. Us wall street insiders consider most of retail out of the money, but now that you have found this guide you will no longer be part of this lower class of human. Trading is easy when you have the power of insider knowledge on your side.

**Strikes:** Your brokerage works on a 3 strike system. If you lose on three trades or try to buy boomer dividend stocks like GE, you will be given one strike. Strikes fall off on a rolling 30 day basis. So, if you absolutely have to buy JP Morgan cause they were Epstein’s bank / brokerage, and defended by their 2nd in command, Mary Erdoes; and, you like that they got caught with a cocaine boat ([https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ship-seized-in-1-3-billion-cocaine-bust-is-owned-by-jp-morgan-chase/](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ship-seized-in-1-3-billion-cocaine-bust-is-owned-by-jp-morgan-chase/) ) you can only do this three times a month. Only trade options and meme stocks and you will be fine. Ive heard stories of what happens to people at with three strikes, I am not at liberty to say what happens, but lets just say goatse’s ass looked better than people who were punished by their brokerages for getting three strikes.

**Expiration:** If you don’t use your options after Ive given them to you here, they will rot. In order to keep your options fresh, its always wise to sell more covered calls described above or call your broker to buy new calls or puts.

**Intrinsic Value:** refers to what you think your options are worth. If you have options that have gone to zero but you really, really like them, well then there is a lot of intrinsic value in them.

**Extrinsic Value:** refers to the value of options that you used to own. You would say, “I am an extrinsic holder of Amazon options and they would be worth millions of dollars right now.” This is very useful information to share with others in the DD section. Extrinsic value can also refer to the value of your wife after she ran away with her latino pool boy boyfriend. For example, “My wife’s extrinsic value at the moment is the price of a Costco hotdog while she is away on her extended vacation.”

Hope this helps get you started!

2021-06-20 10:24:35,wallstreetbets,"Don't forget about implied volatility (IV). This refers to how it is already implied that options traders are extremely volatile. We often get angry and throw things at the most minor inconvenience and people don't particularly like hanging out with options traders. When someone talks about a high IV, they're referring to someone who's been trading for quite awhile and has no friends, family and has most likely been in and out if jail for years."
2021-06-20 10:53:17,wallstreetbets,"You forgot to explain Gamma.

Gamma is the computer that keeps track of all the options trades. It was built in 1985 and takes up 42 floors inside an office tower in Chicago. Gamma has never been upgraded or replaced because nobody is quite sure how it works anymore. When apes buy too many calls, Gamma’s counter overflows (it’s only 24 bits) and the machine malfunctions. The only way we know of to fix Gamma is to just double the price of the stock."

2021-06-20 11:21:35,wallstreetbets,"Another good one for beginners to learn about is the strangle.  This is a common options strategy where an investor will resort to violence to achieve a desired outcome.  For example, if you sell a covered call, and it goes in the money, you can challenge the person who bought the call to a ""strangle,"" and if you win then the contract is nullified.  Be careful though because sometimes if you lose a strangle you will get ""straddled,"" even though the SEC tried to outlaw the practice a few years ago."

2021-06-20 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"I built a program that tracks mentions and sentiment of stocks across Reddit and Twitter! This week's most discussed and top growing stocks! This post is in continuation of a series of posts I made in the previous weeks. The response I received was amazing and a lot of you were asking for continued weekly updates. I have also added the Week-on-Week stock price change due to popular requests.

It has been a tough week in the market with SPY dropping 2%, Dow Jones Industrial Average posting its worst weekly loss since October, and most popular stocks taking a beating. The main reason for the fall is the concern that Federal Reserve could start raising rates sooner than expected due to inflation concerns bringing a stop to the continuous rally we have seen in the last year. Now without further ado, let jump straight into the  

**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**

https://preview.redd.it/tzb0c64t9f671.png?width=1035&format=png&auto=webp&s=4dbbeef62c2512726fbb09c816530267df349263

AMC continues to be the most talked-about stock with a 20% WoW gain in stock price. Even though the overall number of discussions seems to be waning (last week AMC had 17K mentions), investors are becoming more and more bullish as reflected in the sentiment.

Taking about the bullish view, WISH has the highest sentiment across all the stocks reflecting the investor confidence in the stock. Both WISH and CLNE overtook GME in the discussion volume across Reddit and Twitter. Other than these 3, all the other stocks had a rough week in the market with Clover health dropping a massive 20% last week.

**Top Growing Stocks of the Week**

https://preview.redd.it/ct22xu8mbf671.png?width=1218&format=png&auto=webp&s=6ca8052c95641669a2595e96d82ef34b036de2b3

Above is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media.

**Petco Health and Wellness($WOOF):** WOOF had a wild ride this week with the stock gaining more than 20% on Monday and still ending in red at the end of the week. Unlike many other meme stocks, analyst’’ consensus is a [strong buy](https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/petco-health-vs-chewy-pet-131320193.html) for the stock with an upside of almost 30% from the current price levels. The company is expected to gain considerably from the increasing trends of pet adoption during Covid and people’s willingness to spend more on their pets.

**DraftKings($DKNG):** The company was trending as Hindenburg Research published a report calling DraftKings ""a $21 billion SPAC betting it can hide its black-market operations."" The stock fell 4% on the news and the stock has shed almost 10% throughout the week. Wall Street analysts have [said](https://www.barrons.com/articles/draftkings-allegations-short-seller-hindenburg-51623869779) that these allegations are nothing new and unregulated market exposure is a common theme for international sports betting companies.

**Corsair Gaming($CRSR):** The prodigal son has finally returned! CRSR was the [first stock that I identified using the program and did a DD on](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lmmn1g/i_built_a_program_that_tracks_mentions_and/). The stock had a wild week, soaring more than 30% with 20x the average trading volume. The fall also was just as steep with the stock losing all the gains within the next 3 days. The company had an exceptional year during Covid with net revenue of $1.7B (55% increase YoY) and a gross profit of 456MM (107% increase YoY).

**Nio Inc($NIO):** After reaching highs of $64 in February, NIO had fallen to $31 in May. The stock seems to be picking up momentum and has shown consistent growth since then (risen over 40% over the last month). Adding to this, NIO has also become the best-selling EV brand for SUVs in China with its market share now up to 25%. Both these factors are driving the increasing chatter for the stock.

Hope you enjoyed this week’s issue!

As for this week's in-depth strategy, I analyzed the last 3 decades of stock market returns to determine if it makes sense to time the market! (Whether waiting for a crash to invest is a better investment strategy than staying invested?)

2021-06-20 11:23:43,wallstreetbets,"The problem with that idea is that nothing on the internet is real.  Bot accounts, paid shills, and all kinds of bad actors can massively skew your outputs and lead you down a path of just being algorithmically manipulated.  We can all go on Twitter right now and pump some lunatic goofball idea/stock and your system would think its really hot and trending.  People pay for likes and fake friends...  etc etc.  In short, it is a mistake to trust any kind of analytics that comes from applying standard programming tools applied to a domain like twitter.  According to twitter most of us are stark raving white supremacists on the verge of starting a civil war, which is obviously absurd to real people in real life.  The kind of info you would get about stocks from there is going to be about the same level of quality.

Ultimately, who really cares what a bunch of idiots on the internet are talking about since they would only ever be talking about what we told them to talk about.  The best use for your tool would be to sell it to big companies so that they can track whether their fake news stories are penetrating into the firehose of information that morons are using to make bad decisions."

2021-06-20 13:41:56,wallstreetbets,"The fun thing about the internet is that every few years a whole new group of people shows up and thinks it's all brand new.  The idea that big money is using algorithms ""like this"" is laughable.  I play basketball ""like"" Michael Jordan in the sense you are using ""like this"".  They have models that take a week to run with massive gpu resources.  Not some guy who just googled ""sentiment analysis python"" and then ran a script.  The reason the OP has so much ""stock analysis"" and so little technical programming content in their post is that they did nothing technically difficult to get the charts they present.  But they could just as easily write their stock analysis without having done any of the sentiment analysis junk.  They are pretending that the analysis they wrote is somehow built from the progamming/sentiment analysis.  It's not.  It's just a common business trick to make it seem like you have some secret weapon informing your analysis when clearly you just end up talking about the exact same thing everyone else is talking about in an unoriginal and really pointless way.

I am saying this because most of us have been using the internet for a while and are perfectly well aware of how every young person who googles ""how to learn python"" will end up running a script that does what the OP did.  It's getting old.  It's not clever.  It's not even useful.

Again, this is what you SAY, without prove it we really don't know the truth. 

>Give me your WhatsApp I will sent you photos to proof.

Why would you need that? Why not just use imgur lol. It is valid to ask proof because SO MANY people here make straight up lies or at the least exaggerate their experiences.

***TLDR; Rockets and Bananas.***

**Let's start with 30min / 30 day chart.**

7th June and 18th June looking very similar. Also 15th June as well, but we'll come back to that later

* **MACD** \- we are looking at crossover
* **STOC** \- We are under the 20 line and going steeply north. Notice the similar pattern in the 3rd & 4th and the 17th & 18th
* **RSI** \- we just went under 30 and going north
* Also, notice the **two yellow lines**. That is CLF's channel and we are residing near the bottom level. This in theory means that there is a lot of potential going up and far. We'll come back to that in the 1 day chart.

[30min \/ 30 day](https://preview.redd.it/5ifq2l7woe671.png?width=1645&format=png&auto=webp&s=5601cb80dc061122614029ae4e344facfef598f4)

**1 Day / \~9 Months**

In here we focus on our channel, the area between the **two yellow** lines, and the high volume days and their follow-up. But before that let's go through the indicators.

* **MACD** \- Crossover, but not the positive one. But notice the blue line, we are in an long upward trend that has not been broken.
* **STOC** \- Going down, not great
* **RSI** \- going gown, we are already under 50 so we are not over or under priced. For our bullish thesis it's great that we have room to grow.

The **pink**, **green**, and **yellow circles** and the attached lines indicate **high volume** days. The dotted orange line *roughly* represents the low price development. Higher floors.

While the 1 Day chart can indicates that there might be few downer days ahead, personally I am looking how close we hit the bottom channel on last Friday, along side the bullish indicators for the 30min and the 15min chart that we'll cover next.

[1 Day \/ 9 months](https://preview.redd.it/igauzsvfqe671.png?width=1643&format=png&auto=webp&s=7aa24b708b7534dd2b056e905f38fc2d6e86206f)

**15min / 11 Days**

Here we want to look at the short term trend and find similar patterns. At this point it is also good to keep the 30min and 1day information in the back of our minds.

* **MACD** \- Crossover, the positive one. Very similar to the **pink** and **green** in the past. Indicating that an upward momentum is starting.
* **STOC** \- Heading north. **Pink** and **green** show very similar pattern, **green** more than **pink** though
* **RSI** \- Again, we went down under 30 for a good while, again similar to **pink** and **green**.

The difference to **pink** and **green** though, is the what we saw in the 1 day chart. We are at the very bottom of the channel, which means that there is a lot of room to grow inside the channel in the coming weeks.

You might have noticed that we are under our **dotted orange high volume** indicator. If I was an oracle, which I am not, I would expect that the price increases towards $21 - $22 in a steady manner, and then inside that range we will see a high volume day or few that will ignite the next movement towards the north star.

**Finally**, just for the daydreams, let's look at how our channel looks for the next few months.

[Channel outlook](https://preview.redd.it/95hj77i5ve671.png?width=1713&format=png&auto=webp&s=8699af3543fb7b394521db0111b0f1e43dfa5fbc)

2021-06-20 12:05:47,wallstreetbets,"Beautiful chart.  Rips, consolidates, rips.   Looks like its consolidation is almost finished.

Why did it tank last week?  3 reasons:

CLF bought Arcelor Mittal (MT) assets and paid for them in part in shares.  MT has been selling those shares and completed the sale last week.

A lot of gamma expired on Friday, MM likely net sellers.

JPow talking about lumber cooling off as an example of transitory inflation, similarities to steel and other commodities?  Spooked some investors, marketwide dump of stuff that wasn't tech.


Why steel is a little bit different:

US Steel and CLF continue to idle legacy plants and are basically refusing to bring that capacity back online.  Lumber, a few old mills have been restarted.  China is releasing some other commodity reserves such as copper to calm prices, they are discouraging steel exports to calm prices which actually makes the rest of the world tighter.

TX looks like a better longer term buy to this retard, but the setup for CLF may result in a bigger near term rally (see crayon channels above).  Pick your entry points wisely."
2021-06-20 15:45:21,wallstreetbets,Q2 earnings will greatly exceed expectations. 🦾🦾🦾
2021-06-20 09:20:27,wallstreetbets,"I am personally long-term bullish on CLF because it looks like the company is adapting extremely well to the environmental issues that arise with the energy requirements to produce steel. The world is changing and the traditional methods of producing steel are quickly becoming unfeasible, but the company is investing a lot into the ""green shift"", not only by directly building better facilities but also transforming from an isolated mining company to a bottom-up metal production company. I think there is a lot of upside potential for managing their own supply chain and making it more efficient altogether.

I don't also see steel becoming very cheap in the long term, because it requires so much energy. In a world where energy is precious, steel is ever valuable. Anyone who can manage production costs in a good manner will find ways to profit off this and I am long on CLF to be one of those companies. That being said, my personal outlook is a very long term one and could get wrecked by gay bears in any of the coming years up to 2030 because of environmental regulations, which are quite lackluster right now IMHO."

China is releasing some metals reserves - but not iron ore (used in steel).

China eliminated the steel subsidies that were providing worldwide cheap steel & undermining other markets.

China is stepping up regulation in bid to cut emissions.

Supply chains r fuk.

Cliffs is biggest iron ore producer in America. Cliff is biggest flat rolled steel producer in America.  They're doubly undervalued - as a company (due to 2020 acquisitions, which radically changed company) and as a steel company (the P/Es are currently too low for american steel).

2021-06-20 17:29:05,wallstreetbets,"Okay, so ya know how a company selling stock could be interpreted as the company going like, ""Shit, these prices are amazing, let's cash in on this""? It could be an indicator that the company doesn't think the price is going to hold that long, otherwise they could wait. 



Buybacks are like the reverse of that. When a company is willing to spend money to literally buy their own stock back at the current price, it could be interpreted as the company fully believing they are undervalued and will increase in price over time. So it's typically bullish for a company to start buybacks, because they're putting a lot of money down on a bet their stock price will increase in the future and the shares it buys are essentially taken out from the publicly traded float available (I think). 



Sorry if that was ranty, but that's my understanding of it."

https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/commodities/lbs

It peaked at 1670. Now it's 890

Over the past year the price of lumber has sky rocketed to levels never seen before. Then suddenly in the past few weeks it has crashed by 50% what caused this to happen so fast? 

I don't want to depend on the paid corporate shill analyst answer from news headlines. I want the premium wsb inside info"
2021-06-20 11:23:54,wallstreetbets,"There are multiple macro reasons for high likey prices, this large decrease in price is more or less a stabilizing of the supply and demand.

British Columbia mill closures from 2019-2021 has taken millions of board feet of production off the market. This is a function of the increase in wood supply during the mountain pine beetle epidemic that has more or less come to an end. Too many mills not enough supply, likley a few more mills will be shut down in the next year or so.

The wildfires in BC and Western US since 2017 has constricted timber supply. 

The tariffs are very much still in place between Canada and US and are actually increasing at the moment. In markets like this the Canadian producers can pass the 5-25% tariff right to the US consumer. 

Major beetle epidemics in many parts of Europe and Canada, again cause supply issues for timber. 

I'd like to remind you lumber hit record levels in 18/19 then had a bear year through all of 2020 sitting around 300. Likley the new norm will be 800-1000. Many producers were still curtailing mill capacities as covid was starting to do it's thing. With the crazy increase in demand supply was slow to come online again. Costs in lumber yards haven't come down to reflect this as orders were completed at higher costs but many buyers are starting to lock in orders at the current price which will increase demand enough to stabilize. 

I don't see another huge dump or jump. Barring natural disasters. North America needs housing period, the demand is likely to sustain the current prices, supply increases in the US South coming online over the next couple years will likley moderate any wild increases."
2021-06-20 08:08:23,wallstreetbets,"In my opinion it was just the fact that the price was unsustainable. I know multiple people who saw the price of lumbar and postponed projects they had planned.

Price too high, demand dropped."
2021-06-20 08:07:13,wallstreetbets,Supply catching up to demand pretty simple concept.
2021-06-20 08:20:29,wallstreetbets,Basic supply and demand.  People were bored during pandemic and renovated their homes while some lumbermills shut down; this drove supply down.  Once prices increase too much people put off buying lumber to save money; your not gonna build a deck today if it cost 8k when it normally cost 4k.  People aren't stupid and know prices will drop back down eventually.
2021-06-20 08:38:33,wallstreetbets,Finally everyone can easily get wood again
2021-06-20 12:24:14,wallstreetbets,The best cure for high prices is high prices
2021-06-20 08:20:20,wallstreetbets,"Lumber market works like the oil market. When more product is available the price goes down. And the price reflects quantities ""to be shipped in the future"". 

So during peek covid two things happened, people stuck at home started renovating their houses and the lumber Industrie was also feeling the effects of covid. So demand shot up while supply was cut off and price sky rocketed

That's no longer the case as production has returned to normal the price of lumber to be delivered in the future is dropping, while contractors are delaying work so they can fulfil their estimated jobs without loosing money which is easing the demand artificially on lumber."
2021-06-20 08:09:56,wallstreetbets,I haven’t seen it get many cheaper
2021-06-20 12:55:44,wallstreetbets,I finished building a cabin... Of course the price would drop immediately
2021-06-20 08:20:08,wallstreetbets,"Just like the price of pork or most meat, the price went up because the manpower to run processing facilities wasnt there. Alot of these commodities markets are held up by cheap (sometimes immigrant) labor. When everyone in the tyson plants started catching covid, they were forced to shut down processing plants which caused the cost of pork to rise. As with the lumber market, the people at the bottom doing the hard work are people who dont get paid what they're worth, and because of this, its hard for the industry to get back up and running as fast as the economy wants, because they're understaffed. Its not just lumber. Its all up the supply chain in most sectors of logistics. Im a flat bed truck driver but from what im seeing its not anything other than lack of bodies to do the work up and down the supply chain"
2021-06-20 10:38:22,wallstreetbets,I work at a big box home improvement company.  Supply is increasing because of covid eases.

As lock downs relaxed mills are getting closer to 100% output again. They are still contending with the government for labor though. I also use a lot of petroleum based plastics, this is the supply chain I'm most concerned with. Most of the necessary chemicals are sourced from China."

2021-06-20 10:17:39,wallstreetbets,Still isn’t cheap. Prices are still higher than same time last year. They’ve dropped in search of buyers but it’s a small drop I see as speculation from the mills. Demand won’t increase too much with such a small decrease.

i'm not saying CTAs are the only driving force, it's possible that the largest ones don't even get involved with lumber due to illiquidity (for their size), but i thought its a strong enough force to mention here, as well as when thinking of all the other commodity futures"

The big box stores (Home Depot and Lowe’s) and builders were so concerned about availability, we spent the last 6 months saying “buy at any price, just don’t leave me short!” We were panicked by the thought that we would have job sites sitting stagnant (developers and builders) or yards sitting empty (retailers and lumber yards). 

The big box stores now have enough lumber to last them into Q1 of ‘22, so mill order files are plummeting. Similarly, many construction projects are stocked with enough lumber to finish their projects, because we all bought early to avoid our projects hitting a standstill. 

As for future work, the mills are very bearish on demand for Q4 and early ‘22. Some development projects are going on hold due to price inflation. It seems most projects still plan to proceed. But builders and developers smell blood in the water, and are in no hurry to order more until we find the bottom. After getting bent over by mills and lumber brokers for the last 12 months, we’re watching the it fall apart with glee."
2021-06-20 11:49:21,wallstreetbets,Sooooooo  what lumber company do I Yolo?  Can't keep me waiting I want some more stonks.
2021-06-20 11:49:56,wallstreetbets,Demand has slowed down for the price is too high
2021-06-20 11:50:43,wallstreetbets,LoL! Called it. Wish I knew how to short the lumber industry.
2021-06-20 12:06:04,wallstreetbets,"People are making wood again. Hence why mr Powell keeps trying to explain it will probably be transitory... but I get it, we all want our investments to be the winner"
2021-06-20 12:18:48,wallstreetbets,The real question is where in the lumber supply chain were people making the making money. Was there an equal percentage increase in all the points it was there one particular point that all the money was flowing.
2021-06-20 12:48:33,wallstreetbets,Builders put a halt on building new construction because they couldn't afford it... thats the biggest demand and so when it went away.... price dropped
2021-06-20 12:51:59,wallstreetbets,"I’m a small builder, would normally have 2-3 new homes under construction at any given time. I shelved all of my projects in January until this shit comes back to a reasonable price. 1/2” OSB Sheathing went from $8 about a year ago  to as high as $56, and 9’ studs from $3.50 to $11.75. I would have had to raise the prices on my homes almost 45k just to cover the costs of lumber, HVAC, Electrical and plumbing increases…"
2021-06-20 13:03:19,wallstreetbets,"Hedgefunds had been pumping up Dow, cyclicals and commodities like lumber and steel and silver and shorting tech and meme stocks for the last 5 months. Now they’ve rotated and will pump tech and meme while shorting Dow and commodities etc. 
Market momentum is more important than any other rational answers you’ll get here about lumber specifically in a vacuum."
2021-06-20 13:10:23,wallstreetbets,"The moratorium on foreclosures ends July 1st. A bunch of inventory is going to be hitting the market sooner rather than later, so building has subsided.

Plus, talk of inflation usually keeps people on the sidelines when it comes to mortgages. Inflation only helps if it is going to stick around. However, taking a huge loan during a period of transitory inflation is like getting stuck holding the bag after you bought the upswing before the selloff."

2021-06-20 13:49:02,wallstreetbets,I have wood every morning but then it goes down after I take a piss 🤣🤣🤣
2021-06-20 14:17:14,wallstreetbets,Yeah elastic demand and price point adjustments spot price go boom. Hope everyone’s ready for the next round of commodity price adjustments.
2021-06-20 14:27:06,wallstreetbets,Inflation is transitory
2021-06-20 14:39:19,wallstreetbets,Cobweb Theorem
2021-06-20 16:22:49,wallstreetbets,Here is what I think. I’m just another retard so take it for what’s it’s worth. Lumber is readily available in the US and it can be cranked out quickly and easily I think. The costs going up was all speculative b/ of the insane housing market. The issue is builders can only build them so fast so the demand for lumber is limited by the speed at which builders can build. Steel likely has more legs to rally versus lumber. It’s harder to make and we need a lot more of it for this infrastructure shit.
2021-06-20 16:24:33,wallstreetbets,Lumber shortages ending
2021-06-20 17:30:55,wallstreetbets,Supply and demand my WO/man
2021-06-20 17:51:36,wallstreetbets,"Prices have not dropped in Connecticut, prices for lumber right now is ridiculous"
2021-06-20 18:24:04,wallstreetbets,The same thing that made the prices go up. Absolutely nothing. There was never a shortage and demand isn't an issue. It's all fabricated the same way gas prices magically go up on a long weekend and come down the day it ends. They know we need it and they know we'll just pay the price so we can do what we want.
2021-06-20 19:25:08,wallstreetbets,"I have no inside info on this but I think there's more going on than COVID -> paying people not to work + working from home and more time for DIY. I think there is also a bit of a breakdown of the just-in-time model where a few companies realise that they should buy up some inventory so they don't get caught short because prices are rising and they are afraid there might be a shortage. This increases demand and drives up prices, which increases fear of a shortage and fear of missing out while prices are low. This prompts other companies to buy up some inventory so they don't get caught short and the thing just kind of feeds on itself. You get this sort of run on lumber like got a run on toilet paper last spring; at some point companies feel like they have inventory enough and they buy what they actually need right now."
2021-06-20 08:45:14,wallstreetbets,Supply chains returning to normal. We told you the inflation was transitory. How many times do you need to be told? THE INFLATION IS TRANSITORY.

2021-06-20 08:12:37,wallstreetbets,Supply chains left thousands of semis that would haul lumber to sit waiting for parts shipped from all over the world to get them moving again. Idk how the situation is now but perhaps they're finally back to running

2021-06-20 12:14:08,wallstreetbets,Needed a new roof and you better believe i put that shit off until later. I bought the shingles and everything but the sheathing went from 25 to 60 and that's just beyond stupid.

2021-06-20 10:57:08,wallstreetbets,Naked shorting by Citadel caused it to drop. Bloody manipulated through the dark pools
2021-06-20 08:37:01,wallstreetbets,"Exactly, I saw multiple train loads of lumber headed south yesterday."
2021-06-20 14:02:33,wallstreetbets,Exactly this.  Log prices weren't up so it was just a matter of time for mills to catch up.  It wont go back to early 2020 levels anytime soon but it'll hit a new normal pretty rapidly.
2021-06-20 14:26:10,wallstreetbets,"And mills were closed as part of the government shutdown, now they’re not. Another simple concept."

Now you'd try to reuse what you can. Same with decking. Alternatives have also gone up but not the same meteoric rise. But ya your answer is definitely the most right one.
2021-06-20 09:03:34,wallstreetbets,An 8 foot 2x4 is still $8.25 at my local stores. Down from 10 but still nowhere near the $4 it used to be

2021-06-20 11:04:13,wallstreetbets,Sauce???
2021-06-20 15:12:00,wallstreetbets,Lol what are you talking about. There’s billions planned in infrastructure spending and the only reason builders stopped was because the material s pricing was astronomical. Now that prices are coming down hopefully more builders will pick up (barring other materials follow same downward trend)
2021-06-20 13:47:55,wallstreetbets,I've been following this retarded sub for way too long through multiple accounts haha. Got back into it the day I woke up and checked my BB stock had gone from like $8-25 overnight. Thanks for that retards. But also wood is good
2021-06-20 12:52:02,wallstreetbets,This. I work at Lowe's. While lumber was constantly going up Lowes had to install digital price labels so they could change it more frequently. Seen the demand drop dramatically. Sure contractors may still buy what they need. But basically priced out the DIY guys/gals
2021-06-20 13:37:52,wallstreetbets,I used some laminate flooring as a wall instead of OSF boards. It looks and functions ad bad as it sounds. Walls of wooden skin.
2021-06-20 17:19:11,wallstreetbets,Wasn't covid also a cause? People doing all sorts of woodworking projects at home spiking demand and now people are returning to work so demand drops because no more time for projects. And covid caused delays in woodproduction.
2021-06-20 15:46:40,wallstreetbets,"This isn't right. Yes, there is less lumber demanded at a higher price point but that doesn't cause the price to drop, otherwise it would never rise in the first place. Perhaps demand did fall (as in demand at any given price point--as a silly example, maybe we stopped using paper plates and paper plate companies stopped buying wood), but it doesn't make a lot of sense to say prices fell because demand fell because of high prices."
2021-06-20 11:05:18,wallstreetbets,Haven’t seen that where I’m at - still hard to find if we randomly need a large quantity of ply we hadn’t planned for. Still expensive too … at least for businesses at the end of the line and consumers

We've been shipping thousands of tons of lumber south every day since before March of last year and it didn't stop the prices from skyrocketing."

2021-06-20 08:23:44,wallstreetbets,"That’s a futures index, not the “retail” price you or your GC is paying.  Nonetheless, retail prices will start/continue to drop but it’s not immediate as the suppliers/brokers bought high and are now trying to unload those expensive 2x4s."
2021-06-20 09:21:10,wallstreetbets,"I did pretty well last year. Rates are still relatively high for flatbed but i work with the same people for the most part, which means we cut them slack on the rates as long as we stay busy. I liked hauling a reefer unit but wasnt active enough. I only ever got outta the seat to open the doors and bump a dock. So in 2017 i went to flatbed primarily and only went back to reefer a few times during the pandemic. Good luck to yall cus this truckin shit blows..."
2021-06-20 08:38:42,wallstreetbets,"You have no idea how right you are. But what I DO know is THATS the answer that the guy who owns the lumber mill gave me. Theres a high demand for a product he doesnt have the man power to fulfill orders. I ALSO haul a reefer unit from time to time and haul frozen chicken and pork. ALSO the same answer I got from the processing plant. So, while i may NOT understand economics as YOU do, i have literally asked this EXACT  question to the people in the Industry. 🤷‍♂️"
2021-06-20 11:43:31,wallstreetbets,"This guy was 100% right. Grocery stores are running into trouble keeping certain parts of thier stores stocked because the distribution part of the channel isn't getting product because the suppliers are so understaffed they can't even ship the product to the distribution centers. 

The product is there but it is stuck way down the supply chain due to a lack of workers."

2021-06-20 08:27:05,wallstreetbets,Yah cycle times take months. So we won’t see these prices reflected until later in summer or early fall.
2021-06-20 15:23:47,wallstreetbets,"honestly by the time you see the prices recovering in the store or in a contractor lot, the futures market is probably going to be going back up since that means the buyers and the mills will have found some sort of equilibrium"
2021-06-20 09:12:51,wallstreetbets,"Have jobs had to cut back on skilled labor, such as yourself, to make up for those prices?"
2021-06-20 09:26:31,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, it gets worse every year. Only been doing it 10 years and ready to be done. Been trading for 2 years, paying off bills. Ready to be at home. Hats off to y'all flatbed, that's a helluva thing,  especially in bad weather."
2021-06-20 09:13:02,wallstreetbets,"Not sure what deken was going on about. All of these fluctuations have been primarily caused by supply chain logistics in some form or fashion. Just in Time supply chain works great and save a ton on money, except when you have a massive external force that causes disruptions. That is what we are seeing in every market that has been hit by price spikes. The lumber money has not gone down to the growers as they aren’t seeing appreciable price differences, and you know damn well Home Depot isn’t getting a break from the producers. So the bottle neck is at the lumber mills. They are constrained by volume of the factory, but that is dependent on labor. The mills, and many other employers have been competing with the government for workers. It’s hard to beat the government when they have no price motivation, and they will pay you to sit on the couch. So with a constrained supply prices must go up.

This explains the market within our country, but there is another factor impacting the lumber market. The US has been protecting local (US based) producers for some time through tariffs on Canadian lumber. This increases the pricing on imports so we can have domestic producers. If the tariffs were dropped or eliminated that would impact the price in the US as well. But the only reason local producers need a tariff is because it is a shrinking industry and not as efficient as external producers."
2021-06-20 09:18:42,wallstreetbets,"True. We haul reefer, too."

Risk managers will start forcing their trade desks to cut/limit exposure. This will take time to unwind so what we saw last week is not even the beginning. 

If you look at history, whenever we’ve come out of a recession, the market 100% of the time overestimates inflation and has been 100% of the time wrong or way too early. Bond yields always initially spike then fall, often to new lows. 

The trade is long the dollar, short the commodities, cyclicals and after an initial sell-off, long growth stocks (especially ones with network effects). 

Enjoy your Sunday gentlemen and remember, the odds of you even being born are 1 in 400 trillion. You are a Black Swan. 🖤"

2021-06-20 09:49:18,wallstreetbets,"One of the better higher conviction play I did recently was selling AMC cash secured puts and put credit spread when it had that ridiculous run that cumulated to the +90% day.

Sold Aug 20p and 25p against cash and 10p. Credit of $8+ and $5+ for the spreads.

IV was like almost 400%. The puts were green on a AMC green day. 25p was going for $8.5 while 20p was going for $5.5+. Market was pricing in an eventual collapse.

Anyways as with GME in Jan, no matter what happened the days following, the premiums just couldn't keep up with IV crush as AMC begin to settle in a more modest intraday moves. Even on a -40% intraday move the puts were bleeding premium because it simply wasn't having multiple halts in a day. I closed it out about 4 days later for almost +40%. (7-8k premium from 19k collateral on the spreads).

Anyways those 25p are worth ~$3 now while the 20p are worth only ~$1.7x. IV is sitting at -100% at about 240% (still high).

Aug may seem far away, but as with selling GME April puts back in Jan, baking in an ER allowed for even more premium capture before the eventual IV collapse along with letting the rest of the Greeks do their work. And you can obviously close out the trade well ahead of time. I wouldn't sell stuff half a year away or further tho unless you're actually ok with taking on assignment or spending time defending the trade if it goes ITM deeply.

In an age of meme stock (which actually seems to be abating a bit). Short gamma on far OTM puts seems like the easier play - especially after the run and multiple volatility halts. I'd just avoid anything naked so you don't get absolutely fucked."

2021-06-20 13:29:44,wallstreetbets,"Economics is witchcraft pretending to be scientific. You're better off cloud reading than discussing economic theory, friends.

What isn't silly is the assumptions we can make about the people who attribute value to entities and ideas, based on how informed they are about ""value"", ""entities"" and ""ideas"".

Most people do what MSM tells them. The next biggest group does what influencers, public groups and public message boards tell them. We can ascertain what each respective abstraction's degree of informed-ness is, in respect to the zero-sum *game* of economics. *This* information is more valuable than the sum of its parts.

If enough people believe they have a raw material of value, then it can be commodified. The opposite is also true. The dollar *is* a commodity. (It technically isn't, but it effectively is).

It doesnt matter if inflation isn't actually as bad as people think. You aren't betting against economic theories, you're betting against the monkeys and their monkey brains all playing the biggest *game* of ""who gets the food"" in the proverbial concrete rainforest."

2021-06-20 17:59:39,wallstreetbets,"Never said that, because it isn't.

You can't just take fundamentals as the only factor to determine value of a stock, unless the company is literally destined for bankruptcy like a certain movie chain... A hypothetical optimised market would be frankly boring and just a game of  ""who makes what money"". Wow.

But we don't, and never really have, had that. People have emotions and are idiots. Algorithms aren't just there to trade off the tops and bottoms of those movements of less efficient and less informed traders ... algorithms are facilitating those movements too. Why? Because it's perfectly legal and there are millions of morons who look at charts trying to wrap their monkey brain around the squiggly lines to make *patterns*. Put the patterns there and monkey brains go BRRR.

GME has a LOT of emotional idiots who *love* the stock. I'm willing to bet that these people will name their damn kids after Gamestop. They aren't selling, most people are *not* selling. That's why the damn stock is still as high as it is and ain't back at $20. It may eventually return to fundamental value, but by the time it actually does that... Well... gamestop may have succeeded in transforming into a bloody valuable *tech* company.

That's their long game here. Gamestop is becoming a tech company in an extremely cash rich industry.  TSLA traded at what... $4K a share, right? That sure as fuck weren't fundamentals moving that price action. That's for sure."

2021-06-20 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"CCS- The Company Making a Shit Ton of Cash Currently, and that will make a metric shit ton of cash in the future. The Deeply Undervalued Stock That's The Supreme Anti Inflation Play. Alright, I am going to show you guys a company that is deeply undervalued by the metrics of Benjamin Graham and Warren Buffet to make you a gangbuster return. I know right, that is SO DIFFERENT than like 97% of the companies that get hawked here. You see, unlike the money losing companies that get hawked here with the expectation that they will lose slightly LESS money next year (or, even better, the ones that just lose even more money as the years go on), this one not only makes a shit ton of cash but will make a METRIC fuck ton of cash next year and EVEN MORE the year after. Golly, that would be a sight, am I right?

So, what is this magical stock called? Well, say it with me, it is Century Communities Stock (CCS). What does it do? It is a homebuilder (The 9th largest one across 17 states). One that was (gasp) profitable in 2008 (18 years of consecutive profit)!

They operate through two home building segments. The first is called **Century Communities** which is their “flagship brand, offering everything from single-family floor plans to condos and townhomes. Enjoy the freedom to build and personalize your new home from the ground up or find the perfect quick move-in listing.” These homes are 1) To-be-built and quick move in homes, have2) full smart home packaging, and 3) can be reserved online. The second offering is **Century Complete** which are affordable and streamlined homes that Century makes that offer built in savings through a groundbreaking online purchase process and a versatile selection of quick move-in homes. This segment offers quick move-in homes, starter smart home packaging, and the ability to buy them online. They also do home loan, title insurance, and home insurance.

Let us do a highlight reel before we get into the nitty gritty. They have delivered 10,386 new homes for the last twelve months through quarter 1 of 2021, and 80 percent of their deliveries are to entry level buyers (the largest segment of purchasers). Those home deliveries helped them notch 3.6B in total revenues for LTM 1Q 2021.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Valuation Metrics for CCS for Q1 2021**

Century Communities reached a net homebuilding debt to net capital of 19.9% from 52% in 2018. Their homebuilding debt to LTM EBITDA is 2.0X.

Their Book Value per share is 40.74, and tangible book value per share is 39.83. Yes, you see how they do not have much of that squishy “goodwill” or “intangibles.” This stock is a straight shooter. That entails a 1.52 Price to Book Ratio, and a 1.55 Tangible Price to Book ratio.

The trailing P/E ratio for this company is a stunning 7.54 P/E ratio with a dividend yield of .95% (60 cents a year). Fully year EPS for 2021 on an average basis is 11.64, and 12.72 for 2022. **That means a Forward P/E ratio of 5.32 for 2021, and 4.875 for 2022.**

Their price to sales ratio is .47.

Analysts have an average price target of 92.

It is a steal, and I am going to explain further down why I believe analysts are wrong, and it is even more of a steal than they say. But before I do that, I am going to compare this stock to its peers.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Comparison to Other Homebuilder Stocks**

Lennar has a P/E Ratio of 9.10 (After recently reporting its Q2 Earnings on Wednesday), a 2022 Forward P/E ratio of 7.41, and a 2023 forward P/E ratio of 7.23.

Toll Brothers has a P/E Ratio of 13.38, a 2022 Forward P/E Ratio of 6.70, and a 2023 Forward P/E ratio of 6.91.

But Hani, the market cap of these companies is much bigger! Fine, fine, let’s look at home builders with a market cap similar to CCS then!

Meritage Homes has a P/E ratio of 7.54, a 2022 forward p/e of 5.46, and a forward 2023 p/e ratio of 6.62.

The only home builder that comes close is M/I homes but it has a future P/E that lower than that of CCS, and it is in slightly less markets. Still, it is a strong buy as well.

I cannot be bothered to compare every homebuilder stock but suffice to say it is better than KB homes, NVR, D.R. Horton, Tri Pointe Homes, and PulteGroup. In short, it’s undervalued in a sector that is being undervalued by the markets. The only stock that comes close, or slightly edges it out is M/I Homes (which doesn’t offer a dividend).

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Lennar’s Earnings to shed light on the earnings of CCS.**

On Wednesday Lennar destroyed earnings with adjusted quarterly earnings of 2.95 per share. Stripping out items, it reported earnings of 2.65, which handily surpassed analyst estimates of 2.38 per share.

They also beat on revenues and issued an update to its homebuilding outlook for the third quarter and is now anticipating new orders in the rage of 16,000-16,300 units and “deliveries between 15,800 and 16,100 units for the new quarter.”

The Macro Commodity Outlook & Home Price Appreciation FY 2022

Timber prices have made homes about 30,000-35,000 more expensive to build, but ever since they peaked on May 7th, at 1670 a unit they have gone down, and they have gone down fast. It closed on Friday at 904, and analysts believe it will continue to go down to roughly around 600. There are some analysts, however, that believe it could go as low as 500 to 550 and I share that sentiment. That is because DIY builders have largely stopped buying timber with the great opening, home builders are not going balls to the walls with their home building, and because sawmill operators are increasing capacity.

Building construction accounts for nearly half of all copper use (and residential is roughly 2/3rds of building construction), and with China having announced it is releasing its metals reserve and trying to tamp it down copper has been coming off its highs faster than usual. Interestingly Copper also peaked on May 7th at 4.75, and it is most recent close was at 4.14.

Aluminum is used as an insulation layer of building roods, for windowpanes, etcetera. It peaked on May 7th as well and is now sitting roughly at 2384. I believe it will continue to decrease, due to China’s attempts to moderate the prices by releasing its reserves, as well as due to eventual balking by customers at the prices.

Meanwhile, home prices will increase in 2022. Freddie Mac predicts that home prices will rise by 4.4% in 2022. In 2021, “Higher building costs, longer delivery times, and general unpredictability in the construction supply chain are now having measurable impacts on new home prices. The median sales price of new houses sold in April 2021 was $372,400, 20% higher than a year ago. The average sales price was $435,400. The seasonally adjusted estimate of new houses for sale at the end of April was 316,000. This represents a supply of 4.4 months at the current sales rate.” What am I getting at here? Well, there are currently bidding wars, and Lennar’s earnings calls will reinforce that. Homebuilders are passing off the cost, and the consumers are taking the increased cost. What is more, homebuilders are INCREASING their margin.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**HUGE undersupply of homes, and a huge ongoing need for new homes**

Freddie/Fannie have predicted that there is a 3.8 MILLION undersupply of homes, and home builders will need to build 1.2M homes a year just to keep up with year-on-year demand. When I say 1.2M homes, that does not actually chip at the backlog. To cut into the inventory shortage of 3.8M they will need to build more than 1.2M homes a year.

But homebuilders are being cautious, and so it will take 8 to ten years to fill demand unless they ramp up significantly. Currently Housing Starts are only 1.572M units on a seasonally adjusted basis. Furthermore, permits for future homebuilding fell 3.0% to a rate of 1.681M units in May.

Let me be clear then, that this is not a cyclical play, but a circumstance of over a decade of concentrated underbuilding by home builders that is now leading to a golden age for them in the coming years.

What does this all mean for when CCS reports earnings in Q2 and for Q3 and Beyond (August)

I am going to throw some quotes from Lennar’s earnings, and you can spot the goodies. READ IT ALL, but I will bold some things:

**Jon Jaffe Co-Chief Executive Officer:** “Q4 of 2020 is when we saw the first significant increase in lumber costs, which impacted primarily our Q2 deliveries. **The lumber increases, which occurred in Q1 and Q2, will mostly flow through our deliveries in the second half of the year. But as we noted and Diane will cover more detail, we believe that Lennar's pricing power will more than offset this and we expect to deliver stronger gross margins. Looking forward, we expect to see some limited relief on our lumber costs for our July starts as more expensive lumber works its way through the system. And if the current downward trend holds, we'll see a more significant benefit for August starts.”**

**Diane Bessette CFO:**  And now, let me provide some high-level guidance for the fiscal year. We still expect, as we mentioned, our deliveries to be between 62,000 and 64,000 homes\*\*, but with a now higher gross margin guidance of 26.5% to 27% for the year and an even more efficient operating platform with SG&A guidance of 7.3% to 7.5% for the year.\*\*

So, as you can see, this is fantastic news. The reporting period for Q2 for CCS ends on June 30th, which means I expect them to revise guidance upward for Q3-EOY in terms of margin because that is when the housing starts will start to fully benefit from decreased lumber prices (As well as other commodity prices). Furthermore, consumers are taking the price increases on the chin and allowing margin to expand as you can see in Lennar earning call as well as government data, and this is going to be seen as soon as this upcoming quarter as you can see by Lennar's earnings beat. I expect earnings to be at least 3 EPS, and maybe even more, beating the analyst consensus of 2.73. I expect FY EPS in 2021 of at least 12 dollars in earnings per share which beats the analyst consensus.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**The Anti-Inflation Play**

The rise in housing prices accounted for over a quarter of the overall increase in inflation in May ([An inflation storm is coming for the U.S. housing market | Morningstar](https://www.morningstar.com/news/marketwatch/20210619290/an-inflation-storm-is-coming-for-the-us-housing-market)). Guess, who that benefits. That is right, this stock.

Furthermore, purchasing a home is the quintessential anti-inflation play because the mortgage stays the same over 30 years while rents increase to match inflation. Furthermore, your home appreciates roughly at the same rate as inflation when you are a home buyer. So, to beat inflation… People buy homes.

Finally, building costs are decreasing with commodity prices going lower, but margins are expanding. HMMM!!!!!

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Debt**

CCS was upgraded to B1 by Moody’s on Feb 22, 2021, and put their outlook at positive. This is one step below investment grade.

They have no debt on their revolving line of credits, but they have two senior notes. 495M worth of notes due May 2027 u/6.,75%, and 397M worth of Senior Notes due July 2025 u/5.875%.

The 6.75% Notes means annual interest payments of 33.412M, while the 5.875% senior notes give an annual interest payment of 23.324M. This equates to roughly 56.74M in interest expenses. If they got rid of the debt, they would add an additional 1.68 to their EPS in the full year by removing that interest expense.

Alternatively, they can get upgraded to investment grade by EOY and then choose to refinance for better rates and save on interest expense. After all, their set to almost reduce their net homebuilding debt to net capital to 0 by the end of this year (and that is if they only meet and do not surpass analyst expectations. I believe it’s only a matter of time before they are upgraded to investment grade debt due to the strong financials here.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Russel Inclusion**

On May 8 of 2020 was the Russel Ranking Day for reconstitution. The stock was 23.87$ at that time (clawing its way back from the doldrums of the pandemic lows). The Russel Ranking Day for 2021 was May 7th. The price then was 79.84. That is a 334.4% increase in the share price. The market cap, therefore, would have been 3.46B on ranking day. It will remain in the Russel 2000, with a much larger weighting as the higher on the list you are the higher your weighting is.

Since then, however, it’s decreased roughly 28 percent to 62.01, which means that the weighting will have an outsize impact on the share price on the reconstitution date.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Institutional Ownership and Insider Ownership

Institutional ownership is 89.54%. Insiders own 11.9% of the company as well. This is pretty fucking bullish.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**In conclusion**

I have 220.57 Shares worth of CCS and 7 September 17 Calls for 65 dollars that I averaged down to 7.66 a pop. I intend to open a further, significant, amount on Monday provided there is not an explosion in the stock price as this is severely undervalued. Additionally, I think I’m going to open a smaller parallel position in M/I Homes. Price target by analysts is 92 dollars for CCS. The great homebuildergeddon of June 8-11 (Save for Lennar which boomed the day of earnings and the day after when JPMorgan initiated a price target with 50% upside), happened for literally no reason. It was just a sector bloodbath and CCS was hit the hardest of them all by far. Be aware that the bid asks for options is quite different, though not as illiquid as CNNE (My poor CNNE calls are getting slaughtered, but I have till August). This company is super undervalued and doesn’t deserve to be where it is.

This isn't a fucking pump and dump, don't make it one, because it doesn't deserve to be tarred by that association. This is a deep value play. I would have mentioned the 10% buyback authorization they have, but i don't care to because their focused on increasing earnings and making money hand over fist. Also, they should probably focus on removing all their debt notes, before doing share buybacks because it gives a better ROI.

2021-06-20 11:31:42,wallstreetbets,Doesn’t matter.  Nearly every home in Florida built in the 2000s by Lennar and KB is a flaming pile of shit.  People are bidding on them today.  I did litigation support for home owners over the Chinese drywall fiasco back around 2010.  The builders had teams of attorneys and weaseled their way into getting state and federal aid.  The vast majority of people buying these homes are totally ignorant as to what constitutes decent construction.  They see the word luxury and granite countertops and over-pay every time.  That’s how these builders are so damn profitable compared to small builders that build quality homes.

Regardless, i expect forbearances to help Mortgage companies like UWMC, but not hurt home builders."
2021-06-20 11:27:43,wallstreetbets,"Multiple issues with this thesis:

1) Private landlords have been able to put their homes into forbearance since the beginning of the pandemic and most still can. 

2). The forbearance program on mortgages has had a bigger impact on the tight supply of single family homes than the rent moratorium.  

3). Mortgage rates remain low, arguably lower than the real inflation rate.

Because of these factors, housing supply will not increase in the near term (months).  I’m not rushing out to buy home builders because household debt is soaring.  But single family home supply will remain tight."

On a more serious note, there are a ton of catalysts each month: 

Housing Starts, 

NAHB Confidence Index,

Housing Permits for Future Homebuilding

(Those are all monthly). 

Then there are home building stocks that report in late July. 

But do you know when the earliest macro economic data (Housing starts, etcetera) happens? The 17th. Yep. And earnings are like 27/28th depending on the home builder but even earlier ones are above July 16. Don't buy the July 16s. There will be a bump on the 25th, but it's not a 80C one lmao."

That is roughly 2.3M homes, which is far less than you think. And it's ticked down by a lot since then. Then you add this:

""Most homeowners who were granted COVID forbearance won’t be expected to make up their missed payments all at once. Depending on the type of loan they have, they may be able to enter into a repayment plan, apply for a loan modification, or defer repayment until they refinance or sell their home. Homeowners and renters can learn more about their options on the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s website.""

Then, of course, you have sale leasebacks where people can repurchase their homes. Investors are doing this using homelight I believe. This allows people to get cash to pay off their debt while simultaneously being able to repurchase their house if their able to pay off the debt in like a year to 2(?) years. The WSJ had a great article/video on it. Here: [https://www.wsj.com/video/homeowners-turn-to-sale-leasebacks-after-pandemic-hit-finances/456B2D73-D911-46CE-9FA5-9AC2F3654FCC.html](https://www.wsj.com/video/homeowners-turn-to-sale-leasebacks-after-pandemic-hit-finances/456B2D73-D911-46CE-9FA5-9AC2F3654FCC.html)

Here's a good summation of what the demand-supply imbalance is doing: [https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/16/homes/us-housing-market-offers/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/16/homes/us-housing-market-offers/index.html)

2021-06-20 13:04:26,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, there is a lot of holes in your arguments. Let me post this link in regards to household debt:

[https://www.wsj.com/articles/credit-card-debt-keeps-falling-banks-are-on-edge-11620725580](https://www.wsj.com/articles/credit-card-debt-keeps-falling-banks-are-on-edge-11620725580) 

Here's the first portion:

""Americans are paying down their credit-card debt at levels not seen in years. That is good news for everyone but credit-card issuers.  
  
Large card issuers that cater to borrowers ranging from the affluent to the subprime say that overall card balances—and thus the firms’ interest income—are falling. To make up for it, issuers are spending more on marketing and loosening their underwriting standards.  
  
Discover Financial Services DFS -2.69% said on its earnings call last month that the share of card balances that were paid off at the end of the first quarter was at the highest level since 2000. Capital One Financial Corp. COF -2.30% said that nearly half of the credit-card balances it had at the beginning of March were paid off by the end of the month, which the company described as historically high. The companies’ calculations are based on the credit-card balances that they packaged into securities and sold to investors.  
  
Synchrony Financial, SYF -2.88% the largest issuer of store credit cards in the U.S., said payment rates have been higher than they averaged before the pandemic.

2021-06-20 13:04:30,wallstreetbets,"So here is my question:  What about all of the debt that is being incurred by the people buying at these prices?  I sold my home in the Nashville metro area about a year ago at a premium.  The ‘value’ has since increased by over $150k in one year.  It was built less than 4 years ago for almost $500k less than the current value.  Personally, I don’t see the buyers ever getting ahead in that market where land is readily available and relatively cheap.  I now live in CO.  Home prices here have skyrocketed - locally up 30% y/y in this county.  2,000 sqft get-away 2nd homes built in the 70s are now selling for $1.5M.  Buyers like myself that have cash can buy land and build a home far cheaper than the $500/sq-ft that existing homes are selling for.  Maybe I am missing something but it seems to me household debt is soaring and the underlying asset value is not there.  To make matters worse, many of the homes in this market (CO) are 2nd homes."
2021-06-20 01:37:24,wallstreetbets,"Bro, there's a 3.8M undersupply of homes, and to keep up with current year on year demand and not fall further behind home builders will need to build 1.2M homes a year. That's what over a decade of underbuilding gets you.

Like, what? Housing Crash? No, lmao. Just no. 

Edit: Just buy the september calls if you want a shorter duration."
2021-06-20 13:14:42,wallstreetbets,"Credit card debt and household debt are not the same.  Household debt is currently at a record high:

https://www.fool.com/the-ascent/research/average-american-household-debt/

I would like to find a trend showing debt-to-income ratio over the past 30 years.  That would paint a more clear picture.  

Again, my concern is the broader economy and home prices being sustained - especially if rates rise and household income does not."
2021-06-20 13:17:58,wallstreetbets,"I'm sure there is land mate, but home builders aren't building enough. Sure, their cutting into backlog, but not in any meaningful way so far. For the housing shortage to be fixed in 5 years they would need to build 2M homes a year, but their not building anywhere near that even if their still cutting into the backlog. You remember the lots also have to be readied for building, and home builders have economies of scale, where if you built it yourself you wouldn't. 

New homes are pricier than old ones because 1) everything is new, and 2) There is a warranty for the big ticket repairs for a certain amount of time (at least there used to be). You can see it here: [https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/warranties-new-homes](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/warranties-new-homes) 

As for everything: Vacation homes and WFH homes have been bought like crazy by people who have been able to keep their jobs during their pandemic. These people are largely white collar, with good jobs in tech, finance (etcetera). Because their jobs were secure, but they had to save at home, they got a very nice nest egg through savings. Simultaneously, tech stocks (and the broader market as a whole) had boomed. A lot of companies saw their RSU's value or stock grants value increase substantially, as well as their 401K's, IRA's, and taxable brokerages boom as well.

Factor in record low mortgage interest rates, and you see these people going crazy over vacation homes, and second homes, or homes with a lower COL. 

What happens when there are more than 10 of them? Bidding wars, with things like all cash offers. 

It's not that normal people, who can afford an 3.5% down or 5% down (FHA, VA, etc...) can't compete with the initial listing price. It's the massive bidding wars that they can't compete with, and that won't change until demand matches supply. Those people will STILL buy come 2022 or 2023, but because of the demand-supply imbalance they can't afford to pay ALL IN CASH in an offer and WAIVE CONTINGENCY which is what a lot of people are doing LMAO. Remember an all cash offer is king, and even better if you waive contingencies. Homes are being outbid, sight unseen! 

Add to that is the fact that there are institutional investors who are buying up homes as well, and you get what you see. 

I don't expect a housing crash because mortgage underwriting standards are very strict now, especially with DTI verification. Furthermore, a lot of these crazy prices are being paid for in cold hard cash and not through debt."
2021-06-20 01:39:35,wallstreetbets,"Everything is in a bubble right now everything’s is near all Time right now and inflation is higher then ever
if you don’t see a crash coming I’m sorry for you"
2021-06-20 13:23:54,wallstreetbets,"You know this is from Q2-Q3 2020 right? Which is why i didn't reference this. 

But this is fine: You have to understand the largest form of debt, which has been increasing with cash out refinances/purchases is GOOD debt right? This is because home prices tend to appreciate, while your mortgage stays the same, and with each payment you increase your equity. 

Add to that, refinances have lowered monthly payments and you get a good sign.

As for your concern over the broader economy, i touched upon that in my post to you. As for interest rates rising, it should moderate demand slightly, but not anywhere near enough to affect the supply-demand imbalance and the FED is forecasting 2 rate hikes to .75 in 2023 if i recall correctly.

Household income has been increasing in the service sector due to a tight labor market, but that is partially offset by inflation."
2021-06-20 01:44:33,wallstreetbets,"I mean, dude. I have done extensive due diligence on the housing market. It's nothing like 2008. The reason prices have skyrocketed has been because of a ridiculous amount of demand, but a very small amount of supply. That's not changing anytime soon as it's a macro problem that only years of homebuilding can solve.

Furthermore, when you look at valuation metrics, this stock is undervalued. Housing is expected to go up roughly 4.4% next year according to Freddie Mac, that's just a fact.

Finally, the commodities used for homebuilding are going down and in the case of lumber it's going down fast. Gross Margins and Margin expansion is going to remain strong because even if home prices go down, they won't go as far down as commodities have which means that there will still be very strong Price to earnings growth.

I'm projecting both revenue growth through increased home prices, and (later on)  increased homebuilding to bring the American home buyer some relief, as well as increased margin because of decreasing commodity cost creating higher gross margin while there is stickiness in pricing/small and steady growth.

With that said, you do you my man."
2021-06-20 02:41:02,wallstreetbets,"Instead of crap houses being hidden in derivatives it's all out in the open now and people can't stop themselves from paying irrational amounts for anything with four walls. If you thought the housing market flood line in 2008 was bad you ain't seen nothing yet!

I think OP's thesis is good, but the time to buy is at the bottom, not the top. When the market starts correcting, this is gonna get speculated down bigly. How are they going to sell homes when people can't afford to buy them? The catalyst to look for is a minimum wage increase, driving up median incomes and allowing renters to start buying."
2021-06-20 02:44:28,wallstreetbets,"Dude, crash in terms of what? Money? When the market crashes they just spend a bunch of money bailing out whoever which devalues the currency, keeping nominal asset prices elevated. 

You have to put your money somewhere. Can bet on people in the future living in VR are gonna give a fuck about shiny inconvenient real world metals or can bet that businesses will keep solving problems and creating value in the world. I’m a cynical af doomer too, but you have to look at reality for what it is. How many times have people bet correctly on collapse just to get screwed by, in retrospect, completely foreseeable bailouts"
2021-06-20 14:13:56,wallstreetbets,"Yeah.  I am not criticizing your post.  Just disagreeing that paying $1M for a home that was $600k a year ago is ‘good debt’ - especially in the context of an income property.  As for me, I would not touch existing homes that were broadly considered over-valued before the pandemic started.  That may support your thesis though - especially for large builders that are laying down tract homes."
2021-06-20 02:13:17,wallstreetbets,I keep telling people this and they keep talking about an imaginary bubble. Every millennial is going to be in their 30's sometime in the next ten years. Housing formation needed when millennials start producing children combined with tight supply tells you all you need to know.
2021-06-20 02:22:04,wallstreetbets,Wonder if it has anything to do with millennials/older gen z kids finally having saved enough money to buy houses?
2021-06-20 03:05:35,wallstreetbets,"It has a P/E ratio of 7.51, meaning if you bought now it would take 7.5 years for the company to make profit equivalent to the share price (62.01 dollars in net income). The estimated P/E ratio for 2021 is 5.32 for 2021, and 4.875 for 2022.  That's PEG that's awesome. How is it overvalued by any metric. 

The Book Value is expected to hit roughly around 47 dollars EOY, which means price to book for EOY is roughly 1.31 from 1.52. 

Its peers like Lennar have been upgraded to investment grade, and CCS should follow suit soon since it will have net homebuilding debt to net capital should reach almost 0% EOY. To add to this, they are probably looking at reducing their debts by paying those notes early (much like lumber companies did). 

Dividend payout ratio is 5.1% of net income, which is ultra conservative. 

When interest rates rise, growth takes a hit and there are rotations to value stocks, and this is because the value of a dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow. This link here explains it somewhat, (there are other reasons to be invested in value stocks if you think interest rates will rise): [https://www.thinkadvisor.com/2021/04/19/how-interest-rates-affect-growth-vs-value-stocks/](https://www.thinkadvisor.com/2021/04/19/how-interest-rates-affect-growth-vs-value-stocks/) 

If you look at the share price on June 8th, for all homebuilding stocks, you'll see a broad sector sell off. You can see CCS's is more acute however. Now, zoom into Lennar's earnings date, and the day after (The 1 week chart), and you'll see the market react to the earnings and earnings call. (JPMORGAN also had a affect Friday). 

It's not that people can't afford homes, it's that there are so few homes because there are so few sellers (for a variety of reasons). Furthermore, that can't be fixed until homebuilders dramatically overbuild, which they have been hesitant to do (hence the 3.8M undersupply, and the fact they are only chipping away at roughly 450K homes a year in the backlog of the 3.8M, because remember that America in addition to needing 3.8M homes NOW, also needs 1.2M homes EVERY YEAR ADDITIONALLY. That's huge demand that's been because from 2005 to 2020 there has been a massive amount of underbuilding. 

Remember that pension funds, and institutional investors like fundrise also buy these homes because they need yield. The american home buyer isn't just competing versus each other.

Usually homebuilders would be economically cyclical, but they are somewhat cushioned because of the huge undersupply of homes and the natural demand. 

Finally, they are the best inflation hedge because they ARE a HUGE reason why there is inflation as they compose a large part of the inflation index. Think about your rent now, and think about your rent in ten years. Then think about your mortgage now, and think about your mortgage in 10 years."
2021-06-20 14:38:52,wallstreetbets,"Fair enough, just please remember that there are people who said ""home prices will decrease, if I just wait because their overvalued"" a year ago, who are now still renting because of it.

I think WFH, combined with record low inventory, and commodities that have surged (and are now pulling back) have caused this. Obviously in combination with what i referenced before about home savings, etcetera. Just, please, remember that the median home price is much much lower than the 1M you're stating."
2021-06-20 02:38:43,wallstreetbets,"Millenials are aging into their prime homebuying years, so yes. Plus increased savings from the pandemic."
2021-06-20 10:11:02,wallstreetbets,"I'm thinking you might be a little early on the interest rate hike. If your expecting value to pop off because the fed is going to have to taper sooner then expected it's very unlikely to happen. You might end up seeing managers rotate to value mid 2022. But barring some kind of catostrophic supply shock the fed is probably right and inflation is gonna die down by end of year. 

If the inflation data continues to come in the same or even soften by September the fed will have been correct. You would need to see the next round of inflation data for June and July  increasing month to month for your rotation into value this year to be correct."
2021-06-20 15:24:50,wallstreetbets,"I realize most people aren’t in the market for a $1M home but that’s entry level price in my county for a single family home.  A county where median income is $74k.  Most people here buying primary residences are buying deed restricted townhomes and condos that cannot be sold at market rate.  Stated in other words, if you make less than about $150k and want a market-rate home:  you’re fucked.  Oh and for grins, this is Summit County, CO"
2021-06-20 12:48:22,wallstreetbets,"Homes and Auto constituted the majority of  the inflation runup ion the recent consumer price index. Cars=chip shortage that will take months to solve, as well as elevated steel and aluminum prices. Homes=years of underbuilding causing massive undersupply, while there is massive demand. 

I don't think there will necessary be a rate increase until 2023, but the 10YR treasury yields have spiked at times this year, and when they have you've seen rotations into the value sector."

There are 2 important spreadsheets, one for PUTS and one for CALLS. Enter expiration date, strike, volatility, interest rate, and dividend yield on the appropriate sheet, update dates in the various columns, and in cell B13 enter the estimated price you would like to start calculating options prices. It's a straightforward spreadsheet but the Black-Scholes equation was a bit of a pain to translate to Excel. It's fairly accurate on pricing and usually falls within the range of bid and ask for a given strike at a given price, YMMV."

Beta adds some difference, but it not anything special."

2021-06-20 00:16:58,wallstreetbets,"I pair it with FTD data to determine what strike price and expiration date is best. Eg. some stock has a high number of FTDs when SLDs are due so there ought to be some positive price movement the day FTDs need to be covered. Using the spreadsheet I can estimate what the option price will be on a specific date and what the value of the option will be on the day FTD's need to be covered. 

Overall it's just a mechanism to calculate current and future option prices."

2021-06-20 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$RKT $UWMC FUD? Several posts today about Rocket Mortgage and UWMC setting up for housing crash 2.0. The posters have street cred, like working in the mortgage industry for five years.   We'll I worked at a Circuit City for five years so here's my take.

Yes, both companies are leveraged to the tits, but this is how all mortgage companies operate.  They're not loaning out $200 through Affirm so your wife can buy her boyfriend some Jordan's.  Mortgages have and always will be highly leveraged, no one has the trillions lying around to support the US mortgage industry in cash.

Yes, home foreclosures are bottled up and soon to be released, but equity in homes is the opposite of what it was in [2008](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/HOEREPHRE).  Most foreclosures will simply sell, driving down prices, but supported by all the homeless millennials that have been priced out so far.

Yes, the Fed has said they're going to raise rates....in 2023.  Honestly, does anyone think this is going to happen?  The same shit has been said since ironically the Great Recession.  Taper tantrum has become permatantrum.   We're going Japan style and probably stuck with low rates forever.

Unlike the posters of the $RKT and $UWMC I'm disclosing my holdings.  A dumb ass bag holder of $RKT at $26.  

NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE.  I f'in worked at Circuit City remember?"

2021-06-20 10:59:41,wallstreetbets,"I work in the mortgage industry. As has been reported everywhere, there is a low supply of housing and a high demand which is driving up home valuations.  

Example of such is a client who bought a home 2 years ago at $215k appraised value and just refinanced with an appraisal coming in at $280k.  That's nearly a 35% increase in 2 years.  

But no real need to go too much more into depth on this as a quick Google search will bring up numerous instances of things like this.  Homes are selling for well over asking price and once that loan closes at an inflated price, it becomes a comp for homes that are listed.  

It's a perpetual motion machine that keeps driving valuations higher and higher, much like that of how interest only mortgages fueled the sub-prime crisis.  It was during the sub-prime crisis that people bought homes with the expectation that the value would continue to rise exponentially and took advantage of interest only mortgages.  Those types of mortgages have, for the most part, gone away and what you are seeing now is people paying for the homes with cash or just simply paying the cash difference between the appraised value and the sales price.  This is being done not just because of the short supply of homes but also because of the belief that home values will continue to rise and they will be able to sell the home in the future for more money.

2-3 years and the valuations will come back down to normal.  Most likely this will start to happen when the Fed starts raising rates, which will have a negative effect on stock prices, driving down people's perceive wealth. People will no longer be willing to pay more for a home than it's worth.  Demand for housing will decline and so won't home valuations.  At which time people will be extremely underwater on their mortgage due to buying at a time of inflated prices. People will start to realize that they owe $40k+ (or even $100k+) more than their home is worth.  They will be forced to deal with either continuing to pay on the home or just let it go to foreclosure since the gap between what they owe and what it's worth will continue to widen as valuations continue to decline (in part this is what happened with sub-prime)"

That alone (dropping mortgage insurance) brought his mortgage payment down by $179 per month. Most people live paycheck to paycheck, so dropping the mortgage insurance is a big deal for most people (even if the rate stays the same)."

2021-06-20 01:07:04,wallstreetbets,You're making too much sense. The apes in here have too much PTSD over 08. They all think it's going to happen again but somehow even worse than last time. They also think meme stocks are the hedge against the omega Micheal Burry collapse that will happen sometime in 202?. Oh and when it happens it's will all be made into a documentary called inside ape narrated by Matt Damon.
2021-06-20 03:01:58,wallstreetbets,History will say it was covid. Not housing
2021-06-20 10:15:16,wallstreetbets,"Apes who bought the top of our 2 fav meme stock will be those. Since they aren't going to be under water for long after the bubble burst since it is spread across thousands of people, it will bounce back in no time once they start to get back to work instead of chanting behind keyboards 😂"

2021-06-20 11:52:07,wallstreetbets,"Bag Holding RKT @25.5 until last May.  Sold out disappointed with Rocket always stuck at @21 got into AMC at @18.26. Shot up to @32. Paper handed at @28 AMC. The Rocket trauma freaked me out on AMC and I took profits like a dumbass. If I stayed in AMC would be making crazy with CC premiums. Instead I took the profit gained from AMC and went into UWMC at @10.05 and then foolishly with the initial cash switched to BB @17.05. Now about a month of selling BB CC’s got it down to about $14.45. Thinking I’m stuck with BB CCs for awhile. UWMC is a long year holding and seeing what happens. SoFi looks interesting and cheap right now. PLTR maybe another look. 

So yea. Now basically went from RKT and out to AMC and out and now BB and UWMC. And just hanging around with that. Hoping BB software security business picks up with all these hacks. RKT still stuck pretty much at @20. UWMC meh at least there is a dividend involved."

2021-06-20 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Biggest expected moves this week after earnings Hi everyone,

This is a follow up on a series of posts about a simple machine learning model to spot stocks most likely to move a lot after earnings release. This is mostly based on historic market reaction and news sentiment analysis. 

I use this to calibrate my earnings plays in stocks or options.

Every week I post here some my model's results. Last week recommendations on [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/nyn4bt/biggest_expected_moves_this_week_after_earnings/) performed as follows:

And here are the symbols expected to do a +/-5% move this week

2021-06-19 23:54:58,wallstreetbets,"Earnings is also a gain, for the ones who's commented on with negativity. Go fo your research. Let's us GME for example, GME had earrings little over 2 weeks ago. The stonk went up to 320, after earnings it crashed. Pump and Dump for gains, just like us Ape's 🦍 gather for stock it just what other people do. I actually have set ups on stocks with up coming earnings. There's all kinds of ways to get paid, think about it just don't be a full blown retard. Now down vote my comment and then go back and look at stocks with past earnings and look at them candles."
2021-06-20 01:03:19,wallstreetbets,Has anyone looked at Margin levels?  I think this is the indicator of the next big collapse of the markets.  Worse than 2009.

2021-06-20 10:03:01,wallstreetbets,"Now you get it. This is the new way my friend. Started with the “corn” and now meme stocks. Investing in cults is investing in human nature and human behavior and game theory. Sometimes you have to remember that just enough people believing in something can make it become true. Enough people believing a video game retailer can be saved can save that retailer.

Not saying that you should buy into peak FOMO but not taking human psychology into account when investing is dooming yourself to failure."

2021-06-20 13:03:45,wallstreetbets,Y’all what would happen to the market if our sitting president died? I think Joe is physically healthy enough but seems like his mind isn’t doing that well. For Trump I was worried about his physical state not his mental state. I’d rather have Joe than Kamala though that’s for sure. I hope our first female president is voted in not like this.
2021-06-20 13:12:53,wallstreetbets,That’s why Europeans like him. 😭🤣😭🤣

The rest of this is just some general observations.

So it looks like some of us including me are finally learning to some degree how to work this meme thing. Or it could be a lucky streak for me making the $6k since mid May.

Just as an overall reference note the $8k loss was more than made up for by big gains in my non meme stocks GOOGL and the mutual fund FKIQX since Jan.

2021-06-20 08:17:20,wallstreetbets,I guess I just think it’s strange he got over 80 million votes without campaigning and being an open racist his whole career. Compare his number of votes to Obama who was pretty much treated like a god. I think Obama got around 60 million votes and the population hasn’t changed that much sense he was elected.
2021-06-20 07:02:00,wallstreetbets,"The 2020 election also had historically high turnouts, because Trump was a polarizing figure. Such unprecedented incompetence and lack of qualifications made a lot of people vote who otherwise wouldn’t care. Good fucking riddance. 

Luckily Biden seems to be doing better than just being the lesser evil. At least he can actually speak a coherent sentence, which Trump could not."
2021-06-20 09:38:56,wallstreetbets,"While true, this one was isn't explained that way. In 2008, 2012, and 2016, the total number of votes cast was about 130M each election. Then there were 155M in 2020. Population growth doesn't explain that."
2021-06-20 08:19:38,wallstreetbets,Biden was the 'use me as the downvote button' of the election.

What’s even weirder is all the people claiming the loser was cheated, think that this great big voter fraud conspiracy only exists in states the loser lost. What’s even weirder is all of the evidence that DOES show voter fraud seems to be voter FOR the loser, found by his own people. Super weird."
2021-06-20 04:41:56,wallstreetbets,There was like 10 instances of that lmao which happens LITERALLY every election.
2021-06-20 00:12:37,wallstreetbets,"If you did any basic research you'd know this isn't a true claim, actually Trump got way more dead people votes lmao. Also you should look into what Texas did in reference to mail in ballots :)"

2021-06-20 11:51:40,wallstreetbets,The cool thing about Biden being a career politician is that you can find video of speeches he gave 30 years ago.  Why don't you go watch one of those and realize that you're repeating a lie that was pushed with an agenda.
2021-06-20 03:00:03,wallstreetbets,Yikes
2021-06-20 04:22:13,wallstreetbets,That scripted laughter is friggin weird...
2021-06-20 03:20:39,wallstreetbets,"I'm not partisan, and I have no horse in the race of USA politics, but I think it's important to consider that the answer to that question had to be carefully thought over to satisfy all of the allies of the USA, some of which love and hate Russia and Putin. Specifically on a week of their first meeting and dialogue, it's very difficult to balance criticising the regime and not being confronational, while still also not being a fence sitter. 

Is Biden an old man? for sure, he's ancient - is that an unreasonable amount of time to think over a loaded question with potentially big diplomatic implications? ehhh I'm not so sure it's that bad. 

Once again before I'm called a communist, or libtard, I honestly don't care for either party."
2021-06-20 09:19:41,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, the MSM are clearly pushing an agenda. They want you to believe their personally-prescribed narrative.

2021-06-20 02:57:28,wallstreetbets,"Sorry but as a non citizen, trump is a fucking clown. I’m not really a Biden guy but, he’s not destructive. At worst he’s useless and for the US, that’s a tremendous upgrade. The sad part is the US is a complete mess. 

You guys are busy attacking each other on useless moral stances that you’re not noticing your country being turned into a corporate state. I mean it’s funny to see you guys actively vote against your own interests lol. Instead you spend time arguing about what people can do in the privacy of their own bedroom and why y’all need to arm yourselves in the year of our lord 2021. This is while half the country claims to be Christian which is funny because it’s in direct contradiction with the religion.

Imagine someone trying to spin raising wages, having national health care, and improving the standard of education as “party issues”. This is happening while you’re all spending more money on the military than the next 10 countries combined. These things are basically prerequisites to be even considered a first world country lol.

USA, fucking Comedy Central. Like the saying goes, If you can convince one man he's better than another man, he won't notice you're picking his pocket.

The rest of the world needs another western superpower to fill the void while you guys are busy clowning around or China will fill that void. Empires rise, empires fall and the USA is on its way to. Blatant corruption is rotting the country out from its core and y’all are to busy arguing to notice or care. Sad"
2021-06-20 01:58:53,wallstreetbets,Not just that. The way the media laid all the Covid deaths at Trump's feet and the suppression of the lab leak theory and treatment plans is just disgusting. This led to even moderates voting for the democrats. Americans get what they fucking deserve from now

2021-06-20 12:34:01,wallstreetbets,"Have you never met anyone that stutters or, conversely, seen an elderly person descend into cognitive decline?! My good friend has a severe lifelong stutter that consistently interrupts his speech and occasionally results in abrupt changes between two **appropriate** word choices, but that only results in repeated/stalled words in otherwise/nevertheless completely coherent conversation.

Stuttering doesn't explain these increasingly absurd ramblings about little kids rubbing his hairy legs, impossible stories about needlessly initiating a West Side Story style fight against ""Corn Pop's"" rusty razer wielding gang that Biden claims to have single handedly narrowly averted by threateningly wielding a chain whip, having nothing better to say to an Indian/South Asian supporter than remarking that you can't go into a convenience store without seeing an Indian behind the counter, and calling random constituents ""fat"" and ""dogfaced pony soldiers"" while occasionally aggressively invading their personal space, poking, and grabbing them, and the simple fact that Biden's speaking abilities have declined abruptly with his advanced age.
https://youtu.be/VQhqLhbNo9M
https://youtu.be/2HHqcr43qr0

It's extremely disrespectful and ignorant for you to imply that Biden's muddled, frustrated ramblings are how most otherwise coherent people communicate when they have a stutter. My buddy stutters uncontrollably, but his above average intelligence is never questioned, not even by the rare asshole that mocks, smirks at, or shows impatience towards his stutter (for example, his job has entailed him   verbally briefing Congress publicly on CSPAN due to his obvious expertise, regardless of his stutter)."

The past year you'd just occasionally see some slight jabs at Democrats, liberals, the left, etc. anything too blatant would get removed but for whatever reason they didn't do that with this post and thread. 

In a way, I think it's good because there seem to be a lot of people left of Republicans who have fallen for the BS argument that by owning certain meme stocks, they're taking down the rich and mistakenly thought this sub and similar ones were full of centrist and left leaning people with the same mindset.

What troubles me is that a good part of the public feels the obligation to do it on their own now too with compelled speech and compelled use of words.  It's not their job to stifle speech they disagree with and jump right to accusations and name calling when people refuse to fall into line.

2021-06-20 04:05:48,wallstreetbets,"Due to George Washington a new record will never be beaten (100% popular vote, 100% electoral college).

It is unlikely anyone will surpass Ronald Regan for # of electoral votes (525/538, a 97% of the electoral college) even if he only had 58% of the popular vote.

For pure voter turnout in election unless something changes massively with voter laws/turnout it is unlikely we will ever beat Hayes with a 82% turnout since biden/trump only had a 66% with mail voting being so common."
2021-06-20 04:01:58,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, if you look at percentages of the popular vote or the electoral college it's nowhere near the most significant win in history or even of the last 20 years. 

[Only about 43,000 votes in 3 states](https://www.cfr.org/blog/2020-election-numbers) could have flipped the entire election. It was in reality quite a bit closer than is commonly perceived, at least as far as the state level winner takes all electoral wins go."
2021-06-20 09:10:11,wallstreetbets,"But it's not strange. Population growth and massive voter turnout because of the other guy does this. 

I can name a handful of people off the top of my head who have told me they voted 3rd party or stayed home in 2016, then went Biden because ""anyone but trump"" was a real thing. 

When you are as polarizing a figure as Trump, you'll get an incredibly loyal 30% wearing head to toe gear, still flying trump flags and going to rallies. You'll also really motivate the middle-left part of the population that wants a boring ass president not creating what they consider to be dumpster fires every day. 

Love or hate Trump, there really isn't a middle ground. That's the risk you run with a personality and style like his. 

If Trump doesn't run in 2024, I expect turnout (as a percent of population) to be down. 

The gop might be smart to run a parks and rec style candidate. Like a machine. Turns it on and off, never says stupid shit. That 30% will be there regardless. They are ""anyone but Biden"" at this point. Elections are won and lost in that middle ground. Trump won the middle ground once. Then lost it during every election since. If I'm a strategist for the gop, I find a less polarizing candidate who can stand up there next to Biden and be as boring as all hell. 

Run Trump or similar and a lot of unmotivated fence sitters will be at the polls for his opponent."

Some of the biggest issues in America healthcare, and cost of education can all be traced back to government interference that caused the issues in the first place.

Oh, and also the ONLY action his administration actually did was stop travel from China (a place that we didn't get our covid from) but not anywhere else (letting us get covid from Italy).

And then sat promptly on his hands until a bill was brought before him.

All while shitting on the doctors trying to handle it.

And that's the stuff he could have easily fixed. He could have also just like, replaced the CDC folk in China who were monitoring the situation over there for pandemics.

This election, voting age population went up normally, but saw a giant increase (a lot more than any other year in a way that does not follow any trend)

Votes went up almost 30m between 2016 and 2020. While in the previous years it went up, (or down) 5-10m

2021-06-20 17:13:51,wallstreetbets,"I made no reference to Bidens mental abilities but seeing as you interpreted my comment as being that I can see it clearly went over your head. I really don't care what other people say about Bidens mental faculties and it had nothing to do with my comment even though to be honest I agree with most of what's been said about his brain fart moments and his clear as day decline even since taking office this year and I am about as lib center as I can be. I was commenting on the fact that people like you think that it's OK to censor people just because they made fun of the person that pushes your agenda. Somehow you attributed the people who pushes an agenda with every stance they've ever had and attempted to make attacking the individual the same as attacking whatever positive ideas they may have even in the middle of a conversation about another idea. Here's an example, just because someone's pro gay marriage it doesn't mean I'm against gay marriage if I don't like that person or his other ideas and the attempt to push this logic is ridiculous. (Before you somehow twist this example in some report, I fully support gay marriage and used this example as a positive opinion that's used to mask a person's bad opinions.)

>It's pure propaganda.

Also no it's not propaganda to post an unedited 12 second snippet and the fact that you think so just proves how far you're willing to take your intellectual dishonesty to protect your agenda. The poster didn't make him unable to speak for 12 seconds straight, he just took the clip and posted it using it as a meme and people like you actually got butt hurt over it. Get over yourself and pull your head out of the sand. Maybe then you could atleast act like your being intellectually honest about your positions and the people you use to push them."

That’s an easy out. Every stupid thing the man did I got to hear people say “Ah shucks, he didn’t mean anything by it.” Didn’t matter what it was, how obvious, how blatant. 

As long as conservative talking heads say it didn’t happen, it didn’t happen. Tucker don’t lie, right? It was as though people who never gave a damn about politics before went out and elected the “you’re fired!” guy from TV and never payed any attention at all beyond that, except when the high ratings guy with the bowtie was angry. 

If the media reported on anything he said, if the right didn’t like it they called it a hoax, and people gobbled it up. “Well I’m seeing on Facebook and Twitter it’s a hoax. Doesn’t matter any way because yesterday I was saying “it’s not that bad, lighten up snowflakes!” so it really wouldn’t matter either way.” 

Even one of the few positive things, he didn’t start any new wars, was a complete and total accident on his part. “Didn’t I assassinate that general? Shouldn’t they have came after us in some way and escalated it?”

I shouldn’t have even replied because people live in whatever headspace they live in."
2021-06-20 06:50:05,wallstreetbets,"> Then there was the hoax that he called all Mexicans rapists.

Hey man I don't mean to ruin your whole day or anything but he definitely did do this one. In the interest of transparency here's the full quote:

https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/06/16/theyre-rapists-presidents-trump-campaign-launch-speech-two-years-later-annotated/

> When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best. They're not sending you. They're not sending you. They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.

""When Mexico sends its people"" = Mexicans. Not exactly a huge leap.

And before you respond with ""he was talking about illegal immigrants,"" because I've heard that response a million times, he didn't mention illegal immigrants, MS-13 or any of that stuff once in the entire speech. And maybe he flubbed his words and didn't mean it that way, but that's on him. Gotta choose your words more carefully when you are running for president.

I agree with you a little bit that the media has a bit of boy-who-cried-wolf syndrome with Trump, but on the opposite end of the spectrum are the people who try to pretend he never said anything legitimately offensive and call everything a ""hoax."""

Only if your entire knowledge base seems to consist of meme stock investing and Republican/CCP talking points 🤷‍♂️

In the past 6 months, state sponsored Russian hackers fucked up a shit ton of US hospital IT infrastructure, a major oil pipeline, and launched a massive attack on banking/financial institutions.

Biden met with Putin to let the world know what type of future attacks would be considered an act of war. It’s gotten that serious. Biden is a stuttering/mumbling mess, but so was Trump. How many times did Trump meet with Putin again? 5 times?  Or was it 16 times?  

Despite Russia’s sad little *laughable* nothing of a GDP, Russia still maintains a military that is the second most powerful in the world. In fact, the Russian military is so fearsome that the CCP has been forced into a military alliance with Russia. But you know all this.

I’ve lived in 3rd world countries so I’m quite familiar with corruption practices when large government contracts are involved. 

At one point, America was at the forefront of education and that led to innovation and new technologies. Over the last few decades, emphasis has been shifted away from quality education to entertainment and we’re seeing the results. We have jobless and uneducated people arguing with scientists about what’s what. In the year 2021 when we’ve managed to go to space, people are still discussing how the earth is flat. There’s now a huge barrier to accessing education in terms of financial costs and that leads to an under educated populace. The news is so editorialized and people can’t  even filter out the bias from the actual news. They haven’t been equipped with the critical thinking skills required to parse that information. I call it news but it’s more of a tv drama. 

You can’t run a successful democracy with an under educated populace. It’s a recipe for disaster and that’s what’s happening in the US right now. Unfortunately, it’s too late to repair."

Still running that lie eh? At least you guys aren't saying bleach anymore. He asked a doctor about an existing treatment that disinfected blood, he literally NEVER suggest we inject anything.

>Oh, and also the ONLY action his administration actually did was stop travel from China (a place that we didn't get our covid from) but not anywhere else (letting us get covid from Italy).

Holy shit... Are you really saying China was not ground zero and the epicenter of infections?

>And then sat promptly on his hands until a bill was brought before him.  


He started the implementation of Operation Warp-Speed almost immediately, cutting red tape and letting manufactures push out mRNA ""vaccines"" - something I'm actually total against in every way.

>All while shitting on the doctors trying to handle it.  


That didn't even remotely happen. He even let that retard Fauci have free reign - yet another thing I disagree with. Also, [scientist's admit they withheld info on lab leak theory](https://news.yahoo.com/scientist-waited-legitimize-lab-leak-162344951.html) because it would legitimize Trump.

>And that's the stuff he could have easily fixed. He could have also just like, replaced the CDC folk in China who were monitoring the situation over there for pandemics.

It was like they'd rather accept the reality where we had a drug that didn't work and that means Trump was wrong instead of one where a drug that would have helped us with covid but that would have meant that Trump called it first.

He never asked Russia to hack 'the democrats' you're in propaganda land. 

You're using an emotional argument about tucker- who is also part of billionaire media propaganda land to justify what you believe from the other talking heads. Its hilarious. 

The last part of your comment isnt based in reality either. Trump spent 4 years fighting a bipartisan congress trying to end wars that other presidents started and they refused for 4 years. 

> A bipartisan group of House lawmakers who want to stop President Donald Trump from pulling U.S. troops from military conflicts and overseas bases are using **a once-unusual tactic that has in the last three years become Congress’ go-to tool**.

> **Lawmakers from the Senate and the House have in the last three years sought to use legislation to prevent the president from pulling troops from Afghanistan, Syria, South Korea, and now Germany — unless the administration certifies that a withdrawal will not harm U.S. or allied interests**.

> It’s **an unusual reversal for Congress, which historically is far more likely to seek to force a return of American troops, not demand that they remain deployed**. According to Danielle Lupton, a Colgate University professor who has tracked foreign policy and defense votes since the late 1970s, “the overwhelming majority of votes related to use of force or troop deployments” have sought to bring troops home or constrain the president from using force. Although there are a few cases where Congress voted to support a deployment, Lupton said, it was typically a friendly legislature acting symbolically to reaffirm the president’s foreign policy.

<https://www.defenseone.com/policy/2020/07/unconventional-tactic-becomes-congresss-go-weapon-against-troop-withdrawal/166880/>

A bipartisan effort, bipartisan mind you while they couldn't agree on anything else at all, for 4 years in congress prevented all of trumps attempts to withdraw troops from these heinous bush/obama wars.

That isn't even touching on the generals lying to him with troop counts to keep troops in place.

You're in media propaganda land imagining you have any idea what took place in the last 4 years and you honestly have no clue. 

This pleases the propaganda machines.

edit; and let’s not forget he was watching the attack on TV lamenting about how trashy all his cult followers are rather than defending our democracy like a President would. Pay attention kids.

If anything the media bent over backwards to prove they weren’t just hating on him for no reason and enabled all the worst people around him at every chance. Trump supporters may not even know that Trump’s people were ALWAYS on CNN giving their version of the fake news.

2021-06-20 15:08:00,wallstreetbets,"Hey man, taking time to decide what you're going to say is a lot better than just shooting from the hip. When you're unprepared and aloof, you get situations like this:

“Look, having nuclear—my uncle was a great professor
and scientist and engineer, Dr. John Trump at MIT; good
genes, very good genes, OK, very smart, the Wharton
School of Finance, very good, very smart —you know, if
you’re a conservative Republican, if I were a liberal, if,
like, OK, if I ran as a liberal Democrat, they would say I’m
one of the smartest people anywhere in the world—it’s
true!—but when you’re a conservative Republican they
try—oh, do they do a number—that’s why I always start
off: Went to Wharton, was a good student, went there,
went there, did this, built a fortune—you know I have to
give my like credentials all the time, because we’re a little
disadvantaged—but you look at the nuclear deal, the
thing that really bothers me—it would have been so easy,
and it’s not as important as these lives are (nuclear is
powerful; my uncle explained that to me many, many
years ago, the power and that was 35 years ago; he
would explain the power of what’s going to happen and
he was right—who would have thought?), but when you
look at what’s going on with the four prisoners—now it
used to be three, now it’s four—but when it was three and
even now, I would have said it’s all in the messenger;
fellas, and it is fellas because, you know, they don’t, they
haven’t figured that the women are smarter right now
than the men, so, you know, it’s gonna take them about
another 150 years—but the Persians are great negotiators,
the Iranians are great negotiators, so, and they, they just
killed, they just killed us.”

Oh wow, you're right, what an amazing endorsement. Hey /u/DominarRygelThe16th, your family is filled with criminals, rapists, pedophiles... and *I assume* some are good people.

The language isn't even ""but don't get me wrong, some are good people."" Look at the actual words he used: ""I assume some are good people""... like he's never actually met a decent Mexican person in his life, he *knows* them all to be criminals and rapists -- but hey, he *assumes* a few good ones must be out there!

You keep using the media as your scapegoat when I am quoting the man's words to you directly. I didn't factor in any media coverage into my analysis whatsoever. We can agree to disagree, I'm sure I'm not going to change your mind, but nothing about that interpretation is a ""hoax."" He did call Mexicans rapists and murderers.

His aids only letting him answer questions from pre approved journalists who ask pre approved questions, for which he has notes on how to answer. Random off topic stories about his mom when talking to Putin. There are piles of evidence pointing to dementia that you can't write up as, oh, he has a stutter.

GOP Senators are lining the pockets of the ultra rich and tricking their base with lies about overturning roe v Wade (which is highly unlikely even with this many conservative justices), and empty promises of stronger markets and better pay despite Blackrock sucking up all your property.

Critical thinking is very important and even more so in a democracy. Your asking the active populace to make a decision regarding the country’s future direction. Whem you’re going to entrust someone with that reponsibility, you must ensure that they’re capable of making good decisions.

Wrong. He's been openly laughed at by world leaders, Boris Johnson literally laughed at him trying to call him out for not acknowledging the South African leader when BJ had literally just done that. He appeared lost on the patio and Jill had to come rescue him to get him away from reporters. Do you think he did well with his meeting with Putin? Hint: he looked like a retard.

Get your head out of these bullshit conspiracy theories and use some common sense.

If COVID19 was being researched by a lab that doesn’t change the fact that many animals had probably contracted the disease and it’s zoonosis was inevitable.

Gas would have went even cheaper had Biden not canceled the pipeline from Canada, now it has to get shipped by trains owned by Warren Buffet.

With the ultimate superbug in place ready to attack, this rogue doctor patiently waiting for Donald Trumps most critical year, his last, to unleash the deadly superbug out to the world. But in a sudden mishap, the virus escapes the lab earlier than planned and suddenly infects the entire planet. Spies working for The Doctor contact him on his personal email to notify him of the sudden unplanned outbreak but The Doctor cannot risk these communication lines to be monitored and noticed, so he has his Chinese spies silenced to protect his own skin yadayadyada stfu you fucking loser Jesus Christ ahahahhaahah do you hear how fucking ridiculous this  sounds yet people believe it??? Christ y’all are embarrassing yourselves but 🤷🏻‍♂️ fuck it not my mental illness"

2021-06-19 22:04:58,wallstreetbets,I have now averaged up to $12.87 lol 😂 I think this week is going to be good!

2021-06-20 18:32:23,wallstreetbets,"I got it when it was cheap like $13 too. But I bought more at$59  to $62. I mean why not, I can afford it. It just bring the average up that's all. I look at it this way. When  it hit the squeeze I have over 1000 shares then I make more. Or I can just be happy and walked away with $20,000.  But I rather go for the $500,000. Why not, this might come once in a life time. But please..if you can not afford it. Please don't do it. But if you can afford buying just 5 shares like $300, why not? Think of it as a lottery ticket . I  know people who can go to the Casino and lose $300 on slot machine in 10 minutes and then walked away thinking like he won. So what's spending $300 on AMC? Think about it, Cheers!"

2021-06-19 20:57:09,wallstreetbets,Position?
2021-06-19 21:27:11,wallstreetbets,Where do you see average short position value.
2021-06-20 16:39:52,wallstreetbets,"Have that, right now. Sell this before it becomes worth $2000. If you're poor 15k is a lot, just take it."
2021-06-20 00:21:39,wallstreetbets,Getting 100 shares at $40 might a good move if this is still squeezing up (like GME) this fall.
2021-06-20 00:38:29,wallstreetbets,"I would strongly consider selling 3 & exercising 2. You'll have $$$ leftover, but if you're holding them and can't exercise them, your chances of being stuck with them is very risky (even within the framework of options).

If it squeezes while you have the options, the pool of available buyers will shrink considerably and the shares will be worth more. 

Not financial advice, but something to consider if you don't even have $4k to throw at one."
2021-06-20 10:32:31,wallstreetbets,I always feel better when I can turn a single profitable position into a diversified pile of losers.

2021-06-19 21:32:47,wallstreetbets,"Ortex let out a tweet with the average age of short positions being so many weeks old, and that week the share price was riding around 10$ Ortex Twitted it you can look at page, google Ortex Twitter #AMC"
2021-06-20 00:55:55,wallstreetbets,If I sell some do I have to put any aside for taxes? Never sold anything so when I did I figured I would need to put some money aside for that.
2021-06-20 00:43:15,wallstreetbets,One day after :[
2021-06-20 00:58:40,wallstreetbets,"I don't know your financial situation, so I can't answer that, but you will have short term gains from the sale.

If you're betting on a squeeze, you'll have far more tax concerns from the 200 shares. 

Keep in mind, you can also sell far OTM covered calls against your shares."
2021-06-20 15:07:04,wallstreetbets,I’m looking forward to the Monday opening spike in prices now that my 6/18 options expired worthless. You never lose if you hedge risk by betting against yourself
2021-06-20 01:09:05,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the non financial advice...I’ll see how this next week goes...one real question, I know that the theta thing is like the time decay number, at what point or level of theta should I start looking at closing or changing position.  I can’t seem to find any answer with googling theta."
2021-06-20 01:14:24,wallstreetbets,"Like I said, since you don't have the ability to exercise even one of these, you should consider selling them now and moving to shares. 

Theta changes with both time & share price relative to strike price. 

Yes, it's great that you have 3 month out monthly contracts, but like I said, if it pops, the contracts could become prohibitively expensive and limit your ability to sell them. If you do it now, you turned $345 into 200 shares of AMC & have about enough left over for the tax you'll owe on that gain."
2021-06-20 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,I’m going for the high score! 
2021-06-19 20:43:41,wallstreetbets,"I know a guy who can turn that to 0 real quick.

2021-06-19 23:11:10,wallstreetbets,"I'm Confused, When was AMC 2.89 a share?  

or was that  3000 at 5.78 that you sold half of ? or is this options and I just dont get the reference.  

Holding 2500 Shares AMC  and ain't letting go of any Cause its not about my gain its about their pain."

I got in much later at an average of $45/share. No way I'm selling those at the moment.



TO THE MOOON"
2021-06-20 04:03:43,wallstreetbets,I bought at 16 in January. To an outsider I look like a stock market wiz. To anyone following AMC I am stone cold retarded.
2021-06-20 06:49:17,wallstreetbets,"cost price $2.9 per. so must have been bought 20 Jan 2021, not later - very good time to buy 1500 shares"

2021-06-20 16:54:07,wallstreetbets,"Congratulations and fuck you!

In January I had 7k shares @ $4.80... sold for almost triple profit in February after seeing it hit $20 and going all the way down to near $6 to then sell near $14. But man oh man if I had waited up to now.

Anyway, leason learned and the other day I was having more than 3000% profit in one of many micro cap investments I have micro investments in and guess what I did? BOUGHT MORE!!! Needless to say the average up was huge. :)

And as a true retarded ape, then it felt for more than half what it hit. But now I hold."
2021-06-20 18:14:49,wallstreetbets,"This would be utterly AMAZING!!!!!!

2021-06-19 21:05:13,wallstreetbets,"Imagine owning a strip club for 2000% below the sellers asking price, comes with the dancers (strippers) and everything.   

White collared gentleman are willing to pay quadruple the cover charge, plus everything else on top, but only if Trixie is dancing that night.

  Now Trixie only dances friday nights, but these guys pay cash and ahead of time.  Plus you keep it if they don't show up and no rain checks.  If trixie gets decapitated in a car accident while giving oral, you still keep the money they said.

  Now, maybe trixie is a lot more valuable then X4 cover charge.  Nobody knows.  Who the fuck cares though

2021-06-20 09:10:52,wallstreetbets,"given we are about to see the biggest financial crash in history this guy will also.. im not a shill just a guy who has spent the past 20 years seeing the patters and watching as history repeats itself, you guys did something great and i am not saying you should sell etc i am saying you have all been duped in to taking out loans to dump in the market and your life savings at a time just before a historic crash.  
for the past decade myself and a small group have been predicting future events and the catalysts that act as a red flag, the most notable is the ludicrous effort that is going in to getting as many retail investors in the market as possible same as before the dot com crash and same with home buyers before 08.  


back in 2009 i was part of a ""group"" that was duped by the powers that be, much like many groups are being had done them today, both sides of the revolution shall always be manipulated.  


Right now there are endless hedgefunds making more money than they have ever before because they have ALL the data on retail investors and they control the market..wake up and protect yourself and your family.  
Again i am not ssaying sell everything BUT given the chance of sp500 crash to below 1900 of over 50% if you think meme stock wont go down you are mistaken, if you are up on your trades please at least start thinking about trimming your account, take profits and make sure your financially stable (I am delighted so many people are making money in the market but you guys need to understand even if you make a few hundred grand causing a short squeeze (awesome fyi) the hedge funds will still make tens of billions shorting the whole way down... i know of at least 3 hedge funds that have made a ludicrous amount of money off gme and amc etc...they are playing us like a fiddle its essentially one giant ponzi scheme, they know the market is about to tank...they know if they go bust they get bailed out and still get bonuses..so why not go fpr broke and take all the retail cash..biggest wealth transfer in history (not in the direction you expected huh)"

2021-06-20 10:32:14,wallstreetbets,Have you ever bought a call option? You pay a premium (or fee). If the option expires worthless then the seller keeps most of the fee.
2021-06-20 11:43:19,wallstreetbets,"Say you buy at $5/share and have 100 shares. Total investment is $500. You can write a covered call for $10/share (known as strike price) for $1 a share that expires on the next Friday. So, someone can buy this contract, 1 contract is for 100 shares, for $100 ($1 x 100), netting you the holder of shares $100 cash. This is called a premium.  

Now, if the price rises above $10, someone can exercise the contract and force you to sell your 100 shares for $10/share for a total $1000. They get your 100 shares, you net $500 in profit on the shares plus the $100 in premiums. If the stock price stays below $10, you keep the shares and the $100 premium.  

This is the basics, and can get complicated quickly. You never write a call for less your cost and only lose out in potential earnings above $10 in the example above."

2021-06-20 13:44:10,wallstreetbets,"Step 1, own a hundred shares.


Step 2, sell to open a covered call for a strike price you are comfortable selling at and a timeframe you are comfortable holding the hundred shares.  You now have the possible obligation to deliver your hundred shares at the expiration date for the strike price.  You keep the premium no matter what.


Step 3, don't sell the stock until the expiration date has passed.  If the stock price drops and you want out, you need to buy a call to close (should theoretically be cheaper than the premium you got paid if the stock price goes down).  Once your option obligation is met by buying to close, you can then sell the stock.  Selling a call ""naked"" is a very bad idea.  Or selling the stock out from under a call option you sold is also a very bad idea.  Selling naked calls has infinite risk, whereas covered calls has risk limited to cost basis of shares minus the premium you got paid.  A stock can rise infinitely and you would have to buy shares to deliver if the stock price went sky high.  However it can only go down to zero.  

An example, selling a covered call on a stock you bought 100 of @ 10$/share for a $12.50 strike price a month away may net you $100 in premium.  If the stock goes to $20/share on the expiration day, you have to sell your stock for 12.50/share.  Net gain of $350 or 35%.  In this same scenario, if you had sold naked, you would have lost $1,900 instead of making $350.  In the first scenario you sold your future ""upside"" for 10% premium today.

If you sold that same covered call and the share price never reached the strike price, your obligation is complete at expiration and you keep the shares and the premium."

2021-06-20 13:56:50,wallstreetbets,"You have already collected the premium, so if the share price rises, the person who bought it from you's call option rises in value and the likelihood of your shares getting called away rises.  But you have already been paid, so you don't get any more money unless your shares get called away.  At that point you get the strike price per share."
2021-06-20 11:12:58,wallstreetbets,"When you sell a call and the share price increases, you are required to sell the shares by the strike price (if the buyer excercises it), which is now lower than the current share price. So yeah, I think we can say the options' value increases. And if the share price doesn't increase, you profit the premium.

I'm not completely confident on my knowledge though, so take it with a grain of salt"
2021-06-20 12:08:12,wallstreetbets,"I think examples help.

If you own 100 shares of ABC Stock, you can write a call or put on it, meaning you can sell either one to another person.

Let’s say we are selling a call first, the premium is $1, this means that a buyer would have to pay ($1 x 100 shares) = $100 if they wanted to purchase that option. 

also let’s say this call expires in 1 week. 

That $100 goes straight to your account and will show up as +$100 at first, but will fluctuate just like when you buy an option, only reversed. So if the options strike price that you sold was 11$ and let’s say the stock was $10 when you wrote that and now it is $10.50. This means people would pay more for the option as it is closer to the strike and so that +$100 in your account might fluctuate let’s say to only +$50. 

Basically 2 things can happen by the end of the week, the premium you collected fluctuates throughout the week, the option does not hit the strike and you get to keep the premium as it expires worthless. Or it can hit the strike or higher in which case you would have to sell your 100 shares to that person for the strike price no matter what the price is now. Say with our example with the $11 strike it hits $15, that would mean you sell 100 shares for $11 when it’s really worth $15, losing you ($4x100) $400 in missed profits or losses depending on your cost basis

So the reason it’s risky is just like buying the option you kinda have to be right about a stocks movement, and most importantly the max gain is the full premium, the potential loss is unlimited (for calls, still can be huge for puts just max is the stock goes to $0, for calls it can hypothetically go as high as it wants), what if that $10 stock turns out to be the next Amazon and the price goes to $1000? Well now you just lost ($1000-$10 x 100) $95,000."

2021-06-20 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"How to Short the Market - a lazy intro TL:DR; buy SPY puts: ITM if you're nervous, OTM LEAPS if you're up for it

THIS IS NOT INVESTMENT ADVICE - If you don't know what you're doing, don't read  this.

OK,  long story   short, we're headed into bear territory, and you want to be  ready. If   you don't believe it, great, just wait longer.

EDIT: To make sure any newbs understand: all of these are 3X leveraged ETFs, which means they will experience DECAY. So please, if you're not sure what you're doing, either play things very short-term (weeklies or so) or just short SPY if you're desperate to play the game.

&#x200B;

1. **$UVXY Calls.**    The VIX (volatility index) jumps the most with market downturns. It's    the fastest, easiest way to make money outside of a 0DTE SPY put.  There   are two options for VIX calls that are easy for the average ape:  $UVXY   and $VIXY. Both of these are VIX ETFs. Having done *too much*    research and comparing between these two, I found UVXY to be the   better  of the two. It responds to the market faster and climbs higher    faster.Buying **$UVXY** call at the **ONSET** of a bear market is the first move.
2. **$SOXS Calls.** The next best call is for **$SOXS**. SOXS is an ETF bear on semiconductors which I've found hurts the worst at the **ONSET**     of a bear market, but stabilizes after a few weeks or months   (depending on the severity of the fall) due to semis have real assets.   There are a few more options a little further down,  but they don't   react as well to the downturn in the short term.
3. **$SPXU Calls.**    While SOXS lasts nicely for abou the first 10-15% of a downturn (in    time) the value of the semiconductor stocks levels out due to real    assets. This means the next thing to cash in on is $**SPXU**.    $SPXU is a 3x Bear ETF on the S&P500. It responds better than   $SQQQ  at the outset, so it's better to have at the front end of the   downturn.
4. **$SQQQ Calls.**    After about a month or two, $SQQQ starts to outperform $SPXU. So if    you're playing this week-by-week, you'll want to switch up from $SPXU  to   $SQQQ. It takes a while to get going, but when it does, it really   ramps  better than $SPXU. It's basically the same thing by a different   name.
5. **$TWM Calls.**  $TWM is a Russell 2000 3x Bear ETF. Calls basically don't exist, but when the market tanks, these puppies fly.
6. **$SPY Puts.**   The classic. Best way to make/lose money in a flash. Highly recommend   0dte puts if you're feeling it and the IV is below a ridiculous number.

**Some strategy:**

OK, if you're not sure what you're doing, just buy some LEAPS of **$SPXU** calls. Meaning, buy out to Jan 21 or something. If nothing happens, you lose 10-20% and you can bail...

If    you're in for this hard-core, add these tickers to your watchlist,  and   buy some 06/25 $UVXY calls ASAP.For those who are risk averse: buy   about  $2 ITM calls. For those who are feeling frisky, buy about $2  OTM  calls.

I have no clue how bad the market will tank, or when. No freaking clue. But it will, and it will big time.

Buy $UVXY calls now, $SOXS calls now, $SPXU calls soon, $SQQQ calls later and play $SPY shorts along the way.

My  Positions:06/25 $UVXY $28/$30C ($20 was on the money when I bought  it)06/25 $SOXS $8C06/25 $SPXU $20C07/26 $UVXY $36C07/26 $SPXU $2xC01/22  et al

I have more positions than this, but there are to  many to list. You get the point.Good luck everyone."

2021-06-19 20:10:11,wallstreetbets,"True. Except that inflation at \*these levels\* e.g. 20% real inflation (not the bogus 5% reported) means that banks are eating sh\*t right now with their el cheapo 3% loans and 10%+ real inflation (I throw 10% around here bc some won't believe 20% is real, although all indicators show it is)

If the banks fail, the street fails. The street long ago ceased to be 'real assets' in the traditional sense because valuations left reality a long time ago. It's all about projection now, and what 'could' be, which is speculation. 

Even WSB isn't about 'real assets' so I don't know why you all are arguing this crap.   
WSB made it's fame on a MOASS, which has nothing to do with real world economics. It's all about gaming the gamers in a closed-loop marketplace. 

Look, I didn't want to spend a bunch of letters arguing the bear case. I still don't. I don't care to, I just wanted to let anyone out there who didn't know anything, know how to short the market in case they wanted to. 

The reality is: foreclosures have been banned for nearly a year. A YEAR OF NO FORECLOSURES. That's crazy.   
They're due to be released in a few weeks. When that happens (if they let it) a wave of foreclosures will hit the real estate market, tanking it a bit (not collapsing it). 

Add in reduced construction starts due to increase in materials costs and no correlation in real wages increased, and you have a real estate problem. 

Combine real estate problem with inflation problem: banks give money for 3% interest and lose at least 5% on that 3% gain, 

and you have a setup for real problems in two of the largest finance sectors in the country. If either of them goes down, the market goes with them.

What am I missing here?"

Learned contago from oil 2020 - how will backwardation occur with UVXY at these low levels?   
They're impossibly low, and you're right, after the ONSET of the bear market, UVXY stabilizes. 

That's why I recommended shifting from $UVXY to $SPXU or similar after the onset of the decline.

Maybe I didn't make it clear enough though? Should i reword that?

Great comment, thanks"
2021-06-20 13:12:40,wallstreetbets,Could you explain how the 10 year relates to equities?
2021-06-20 11:52:26,wallstreetbets,"true - it's only good when things really start getting bad. 

We have never seen what's coming, and have no idea how it will unfold.   
If it's sudden, then UVXY will not pay as well as SPY puts. 

If it is a nice steep decline over weeks and months, which I'm expecting, then it will pay in spades. (from what I can see)

I'm definitely open to better ideas though. That's the point of posting this stuff. If you have a better strategy, please let me know, I'm glad to sharpen the pencil."

I've been creamed on it already, but I am looking for a reason to \*not\* think this way, and simply don't see any. 

In the worst case, we experience another organic correction (due for a monthly/quarterly correction anyway) and it's right back to brrrrrr. 

In the best case (for my portfolio) I've caught this at the very beginning, and will sail into the crash with golden wings."
2021-06-19 20:37:51,wallstreetbets,"There's a reason they're triply leveraged.   
When they gain, they compound. It takes a bear market to show their value: you have to look at last year to see it. 

Also, calls have been incredibly cheap for all of them, and when I did the calcs, the ROI was better over the longer run than SPY puts. 

Be glad to see otherwise though, thanks for pointing it out: will you break that down in a bit more technical detail so all the kids can see it?"
2021-06-19 21:18:51,wallstreetbets,"For me it is horrifying.   
it's almost always the little people that get hurt. 

All the 401k's vaporizing. That's years of actual... hard work.   
Making so much sitting here in front of a screen doesn't seem like work when I compare it to the people creating real products for the rest of us. 

I hate that they will lose so much so fast, and never know what happened, or how to avoid it. 

Indeed, the banks always make it, but this time they will have to literally re-write the rules for it to work, because there is nearly no leverage left in the system (from what I see). 

The years of harnessing 2nd/3rd world countries is practically over, China is now a real competitor and Russia is self-sufficient. 

Not sure how this one could be averted now... I'm betting it is Q3 this year as well."

The best thing to do is whatever you are comfortable doing.   
If you trade options already, just follow the tickers above and get a feel for how they trade, and what they're worth (I flip between them according to best value)

For instance, when it's Friday, and I think there will be a dip, I play SOXS with $8C options, because it's usually right around $8, and the delta is nearly 1. 

Which means, if SOXS goes up by like $0.08 I double my money, and if it goes down, the intrinsic value is already at a minimum, so I don't much (maybe 30% if I wait too long). 

But I never hold until close, and I don't hold while the market is \*clearly\* going up ;)"

2021-06-20 11:49:15,wallstreetbets,"It's a catch 22. 

Print more money = make inflation go higher. If it's really at 20% right now (which is what the very Fed formula actually indicates, despite their saying otherwise), printing only creates higher inflation. 

You can only print more money when it saturates into the economy. Kind of like watering the ground: as long as it soaks in, you can just keep dumping it on. 

The second the ground saturates, pouring more water on just makes it run over.   
I think we've reached that point. Pouring more money into the market will no longer stimulate it. They've been pouring hundreds of billions in for months and SPY hasn't broken the 425 ceiling with any vigor. 

Pouring in trilliions might do it, but that creates a feedback loop that will cause the USD to crash on the world markets.... 

We're only able to print money because other nations buy it. The second we overleverage them, and they decide to start dumping the USD (e.g. Russia is right now) there's no more room to print money... = big trouble"
2021-06-20 17:42:09,wallstreetbets,"No idea what's happening there, but I had the issue when I tried to sell $RVVTF a while back, it kept short selling instead of actually selling. 

So, just double check the instructions are to sell the $UVXY Call, and not sell a $UVXY short. 

Remember, everything I listed up there is an inverse equity, which means whatever SPY does (in general), those will do the opposite. So you want to buy Calls for them.

If you sell-to-open you will have infinite liability.   
Make sure you are selling-to-close"

2021-06-19 21:38:23,wallstreetbets,"FFS interest rates were always going to rise. The economic impact of covid was no where near as bad as predicted and the economy has bounced back nicely. Unemployment is fairly low and somewhat artificially inflated by unemployed workers not wanting low wage jobs due to higher unemployment benefits. 

Inflation is a problem, but some of it is covid related itself. Companies also thought the economic impacts of covid would be more severe and reduced output accordingly coupled with covid related closures affecting the supply chain and you have scarcity that isn't going to last. 

Even if there is a recession or market dip don't blame something as predictable as rates rising during an economic recovery, that should always be the case. Only retards think 0% is sustainable."

2021-06-20 16:39:07,wallstreetbets,"Because it's leveraged, it doesnt matter how low it goes. As I understand, CBOE has to continually roll out their vix futures because they expire worthless 90% of the time. It wont just one day spike to $1000 for this reason. CBOE will continually close out and roll futures, which is why uvxy shows it was at 12000$ 5 years ago. . . 

In short, UVXY is a super short term play. 

VXX is less leveraged so a little bit safer (cause its a 2x leverage)

Playing VIX is safest if your brokerage allows. 

SPXU works in the same way as UVXY.

2021-06-19 22:05:19,wallstreetbets,They’re meant for day trading in which case the decay doesn’t apply.  Basic idea behind the decay: imagine a stock is 100 and you have a 3x leveraged etf of it. It drops 20% to 80 and you go down 60%. Next day it gains 25% and goes back to 100 and you go up 75%. Are you back at even since the stock is 100 then? No you’re at 70 so you’ve lost 30% even though the stock is flat.  Over the course of 6 months you will get ravaged holding these 3x ETFs unless it goes up or down in a completely straight line.

2021-06-20 11:29:20,wallstreetbets,"You're missing the key point: foreclosures are verboten.Foreclosures drive the market prices down. They're like a hole in the valuation bucket, where neighborhoods go up in value, but a foreclosure brings all the values down a little bit (because they usually sell for dirt cheap).

When you plug that hole, all the prices are artificially inflated a little bit.I said pretty clearly that it wouldn't cause a crash, but would cause a deflation in prices...

That deflation, combined with a slowing of housing starts due to construction materials price increases results in a negative feedback loop.

THIS will cause RE to start dwindling, and with no rise in real wages, it will not recover fast enough to prevent spiraling.

The only people with the money to actually buy these houses are banks, who are getting free money.

But how are they going to pay for these houses, when they're losing 7% on every loan right now?  
They don't want to be landlords, they want to sell these houses....

If inflation is pushing all prices up, wages are not increasing accordingly, and foreclosures start flowing back into the market, are you telling me the whole thing will keep going up because of rich people? 

The little people still have to pay rent, and rent is not cheaper than the mortgage...  
So how are the vast majority of Americans going to live?   
My point is: there aren't enough rich people to buy houses to keep the market afloat, because they are STILL dependent on poor people to rent said houses, and if poor people don't get wage increases equitable to the real inflation, the whole thing comes down.

The money printer can't burn any hotter right now... it will push inflation past 20%.

Just because the stock went up, doesn't mean the company will continue to crush it. 

Lots of ""free money"" was printed, which boosted bottom lines, and made everybody look good (the entire market went up, except stuff like Cruise Lines, etc.) 

The problem is, that created a situation of higher inflation by a HUGE amount.   
The past does not indicate the future when you hit situations of inflation at this scale. The problem is, we haven't seen real inflation at these levels in half a century (at least), so you have to go back to half a century ago to see what happens in this case...

Think of it this way: If you're a bank, and you're lending money at 3%, and the money you loaned is losing value at 10%, you are LOSING money. 

i.e. you loan $10k and you get $9.3k back over time. (in purchasing power terms)."

2021-06-19 20:33:19,wallstreetbets,"I appreciate your insights, thanks.   
I typically take 50% as soon as possible to cover potential losses.   
Better to lose 50% of profits than 100% of positions. 

Also, what do you make of the Fed reporting 5% inflation when it's really *minimum* double that?

Another question for ya: With the interest rate going negative, and real inflation going nova, how do banks turn a profit outside of the market?

Finally, what are your takes on the housing market? I don't see how anyone can buy a house now. Everything in the sun belt is roughly 2x what it was last year, and wages haven't budged."

2021-06-20 12:58:49,wallstreetbets,"Those two things have a correlation though, that's why people who are upset the fed is moving up interest rate hikes are retards. 

Also you might be a doomer about inflation but the Fed isn't being completely dishonest about some of the prices being transitory. There is a shit ton of temporary scarcity throughout the supply chain. Price stickiness always happens but sectors with healthy competition won't be as affected."

I can't quite remember which meeting but essentially it sounded like they were looking at the combined total over a 12 month period, so the average inflation over that period. They may be misrepresent the data and its over 5% but I want to give them some benefit of doubt on that.

Atleast the next bank earnings around July 13/14th should still be fairly strong, they always appear to squeeze profits some something, don't want to speculate to much on what will have for the Q3 though...

I really like the housing market prospects right now, not only do you currently have TLT up/ Yields down which is great for housing market but demand appears to be very strong. That being said it appears alot of offers are coming from international buyers, not sure how that will affect things."

We're discussing, so I'm sharing my view. 

I remember in 2008, I was in the ocean with some friends and we were talking about how it had to crash. We couldn't understand why it hadn't, but we all knew it would. 

The next week it suddenly came down. 

I have exactly the same vibe right now about the market."

2021-06-20 13:11:26,wallstreetbets,"This. Jpow is not lying to everyone lol. Inflation is here to stay some places, but already heading out the door in other places"

2021-06-20 17:43:07,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, biggest bull of all time.   
That's why I like UVXY and some of the others. They've only been crushed since inception, so there's basically no good data on what they do when there's a bear market. 

From what I can tell, if SPY goes back to the 200's, UVXY will leave the solar system"
2021-06-19 21:05:07,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for your insights, really glad to have a bit more from others, thank you.

The market taper always comes before it's expected though. Fast forwarding the JPow talk, they are walking things back about a year a month. That gives us to about August/Sep before things start getting really ugly. Which matches your Q3 hesitation.

But I'm of the opinion that we should have passed SPY 425 long ago if the momentum was still building.The fact that we keep topping out is serious. Not only that, but the corrections after topping are painful, not organic.

Final note: is the Fed is directly injecting the market. This is unsustainable. The whole thing is a leverage of a leverage with leverage, and everyone is betting that everything else will hold. Much like 2007 and other similar scenarios.

For the sake of everyone's 401ks, I hope it doesn't go, but I'm not sure how they would stop it if inflation really has passed 10% without throwing down some rate increases.

JPow effectively said, ""this too, shall pass"" but there are absolutely no indications that is accurate.

The WH is printing with no concern for the impact. It's gone from money printing to a money river.

In the history of the world, inflation at these levels has never been sustainable.

The question in my mind is: when."
2021-06-19 23:11:23,wallstreetbets,"Would love to see this!

I see a sick bull as well. That puppy is NOT looking good, and although I can understand the excitement, I don't understand people who can't see how sick it is.

2021-06-19 22:54:36,wallstreetbets,"insults, a good comment, do not make."
2021-06-20 11:55:26,wallstreetbets,"True. 

I'm of the opinion that it's only a stalling tactic to enable banks and institutions to park their money before the thing craters. 

There's nothing preventing JPow from coming out Tuesday and saying they encountered some new metrics and have to make an adjustment.

Now there is talk of the bank in Norway is gonna fuck with interest so it’s anyones guess until that happens. I’m leaning towards there being a downtrend below 8.1 but if I wake up on the other side of the bed I’m like fuck this bitch could blast off above 8.6. Sooooo I’ll say one word …arbitrage!

2021-06-19 23:04:29,wallstreetbets,"Hey, one parting shot. 

My best play atm is $RTP... 

They just filed paperwork for their vote to merge, which means a high probability of it merging in the second week of July. 

The 07/16 calls are tight (may not happen by then) but the 08/20 calls should be almost a dunk. 

It's the best development in the UAM space (I have direct connections with this space, but no insider info)."
2021-06-19 22:29:42,wallstreetbets,"Sorry, I short-changed the expression. 

If they loan me money at 3% interest, and I turn around and put that money into assets which appreciate with the rate of inflation, which is (at least) 10%, then my net gain on the loaned money is 7%. 

So you're right, they're not directly paying me, but in essence, they're losing that 7% due to inflation, and as long as I'm not holding the loan in cash, I gain their 7% loss (without speculating, just dropping it into a real world asset that doesn't depreciate)"

2021-06-20 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"UPST and the rise of our AI overlords: Disclaimers: 

I am not an advisor, this is not financial advice. This is for entertainment purposes only.

This is my third DD post, though the previous two were deleted immediately by jannies. I was right once (ANVS at 45) and wrong once (SNDL at .98), though that last one may still pan out. Given that I'm up 100% on one and and down 7% on the other I think my record is good, but I'm an autistic narcissist, so make your own judgements.

The DD. So, UPST has had a rough month. The lockup expiry, the fed meeting, pullback from hitting a new ath and heavy shorting. It's currently trading at 123. Here's why I think it's a good play:

Historically, UPST has a pattern of higher highs and higher lows. It's highly volatile, being a new growth company, but the pattern is pretty stark. It currently shows high support around 119, which is what the charts suggest should be the bottom of this dip, though it could be 117. Either way, any time it has approached those levels it has immediately shot back up. Again, the pattern is pretty clear and it indicates the next cyclical top should be >200, though that may or may not hold up. That's not why I think it's a good play, though.

1. UPST has already survived most of the events that tank growth companies, such as lockup expiry and a secondary offering. In fact, it reached a new ath shortly after the dip coming from the secondary. There isn't much left to tank the stock in the shorter term other than poor performance.
2. UPST has performed exceptionally well since IPO, showing steady growth in revenue over the last 3 quarters, with q1 2020 doubling the revenue from q3 2020. Net income has risen as well and it has crushed expectations at every EC, beating eps by 310% q4 2020 and 47% q1 2021. PE estimates for 2021 are at 399. D/E is 1, which is more than fine for the industry. It's got a good deal of cash on hand and nice liquidity, so paying debts doesn't present an issue.
3. After the shorts (I believe most have already covered, by the way) it stands at 58% institutional ownership. While this opens the door to some fuckery (shorting at ath, for example) it also sets a nice floor for the stock, since they obviously believe in it. Additionally, most of the insiders did not dump stock at the lockup expiry, with some actually adding shares, suggesting they believe strongly in the company as well.
4. The stock has been upgraded multiple times, with the most recent being an overweight evaluation at 145. I can't find a single analyst that thinks UPST is overvalued at this price. The median stock target is about 14% higher than current, with higher expectations into the 190 range. Even the MF is backing this one, and hard. I know what we all think of them and analysts at large, but the fact that no-one seems to think this should be so low is hard to not view as a positive.
5. As for the company itself, it's an AI lending company focusing on small consumer lending. This is a growth sector for several reasons, both economic and social. The algorithmic lending process means less overhead, a plus in an increasingly automated economy. Consumer lending is a lucrative field even in an economic downturn, and offering small to middle-size loans to individuals who need extra float in a struggling economy is huge. Socially, the algorithmic nature of the lending process also means that it is entirely free from human bias, a huge marketing tack in an increasingly woke culture focused on providing opportunity and equity to everyone. 
6. NAFCU recently announced Upstart as a preferred partner, which is huge since credit unions drive a large portion of small consumer lending. This should mean an even greater increase in revenue, and Upstart has already raised revenue expectations for the year by 20%.
7. Upstart as a company has almost universally good reviews both from the industry and customers, with the average being 4.2 to 4.6 out of five. This drives repeat business and further growth.

Honestly, this seems like a clear win. It's not a meme (though memers could also profit) and I am not a meme investor (congrats and fuck you on the recent tendies) but an actually undervalued company. Earnings are in August, so Sept calls are a play. Honestly, though, IV is a killer and you'd do better to grab shares (current profits on 100 stock if it hits 180 is 5,700, whereas even a 20% OTM 140 call only profits 2k without factoring in changes in IV).

Two final things. I own this stock (250 sh at 119.6 avg) so I stand to profit if everyone drives this up. I'm shamelessly shilling, but it's not really shilling since I believe what I'm saying. I also believe that a future in which small, struggling consumers take on debt issued by a faceless AI system is exactly the sort of dystopian, technocratic hellscape we're heading towards, so I'm betting on that as well.

2021-06-20 13:47:38,wallstreetbets,I would just keep the stock and borrow against it  if i need cash. Thats pretty much what people with actual money do and idk why this guy would sell at 600 LOL
2021-06-19 21:33:48,wallstreetbets,That would be a smart idea. Make more money.

Did same thing on Friday when it peaked / crashed."
2021-06-20 16:40:15,wallstreetbets,"You're a retarded ape, glorious"
2021-06-19 21:40:05,wallstreetbets,"There's a little risk.
If the price has dropped since you original bought and you do a covered call where the strike price is below the amount you paid then you run a risk there. 
The other is just the risk that you won't make as much money if the price really moons."
2021-06-19 22:58:44,wallstreetbets,"Well, you need the capital up front to own the shares... assuming you dont go naked for that unlimited risk. 

Secondly,  yes you can collect a premium but they usually don't demand high prices unless you have long expiry dates. Trade off is locking up capital if the stock prices rocket... it likely won't be called away until expiration due to intrinisic and extrinsic values. Unless you have the money to purchase back your calls... for a loss... then you're just waiting. If the stock falls drastically you can buy back for nothing or let it expire and keep all of it but then you might be bagholding a crap stock.

There's definite risks even on covered calls."
2021-06-20 05:14:03,wallstreetbets,"CC are great. But they do inherit some risk and OP was lucky and smart at the same time. 


Simply put:


If you sell a CC you limit your upside. If OP had sold them right when AMC was mooning, he would have lost the shares and limit his profit potential. Which was something a lot of thetagang members suffered.


If you sell a CC you have to hold the shares. If the stock price drops you may keep the premium but you will suffer the loss of the shareprice and will be stuck bagholding.


There are a few more things to consider and if you like more info on the topic, check out Kamikaze Cash on YT. He breaks it down perfectly for us degenerates to get it.

You don't have to have a massive portfolio to trade them. There are tons of stocks under 10$ you can trade them on."
2021-06-20 06:50:06,wallstreetbets,Anyone got the time and knowledge to explain covered calls to me 🙃
2021-06-20 09:49:36,wallstreetbets,"What really sucks though is when the stock goes bananas midweek but tanks before Friday. Buying to close could get really expensive so you can't capture that profit, so you mentally prepare to settle for whatever profit you can get then Friday comes around and it's below the strike anyways."
2021-06-20 16:06:54,wallstreetbets,CCs are not zero risk. There is the potential for substantial underperformance using these.
2021-06-20 15:57:20,wallstreetbets,This is the number one comment I receive whenever I post a gain here!
2021-06-19 23:52:26,wallstreetbets,"I read this and think ""yep the crash is coming soon, no wins for me."" When everyone is winning this big, relative to each other no one is winning but the 1% still. Can't wait to be paying $20 for double cheeseburgers at McDonald's."
2021-06-19 20:22:52,wallstreetbets,80+ is not enough premium for me personally. I’ve been sticking between 55-70 and if it moves above I just roll it out and up.
2021-06-20 15:21:19,wallstreetbets,I typically sell weekly on Monday mornings and I’ll usually go $10-15 above the current price depending on what price action and IV looks like on Monday morning.  If IV is really high (relative to the previous week) I’ll go farther up OTM.

2021-06-20 04:58:53,wallstreetbets,"Covered CALLs is a nice way to cashflow shares that don't move, and shares with high volatility ( like AMC ), though you limit your upside for short term cashflow.

I use them to increase gains on defensive shares as I am unhappy with just the dividends as income."
2021-06-20 10:52:12,wallstreetbets,"I just scalp cause I do want to get my shares called away at the end of the week. CCs is the best way to play Options. They are synthetic dividends for tech stocks that don’t pay them.

When you are selling CALLs it is weird, SELL TO OPEN, BUY TO CLOSE.

But that THETA crush is always on your side when selling CALLs. You are the HOUSE and it will scare you straight watching that short term Call profit melt away in your favor."

2021-06-20 15:55:17,wallstreetbets,This is well put here. This is why i didn’t start selling these CCs until the price leveled at the top. Selling during a momentous move to the upside is trouble.
2021-06-20 15:55:41,wallstreetbets,YouTube does. There are literally hundreds of videos.
2021-06-20 05:06:03,wallstreetbets,I think some people are already paying $20 for a double cheeseburger with apps like DoorDash so people are used to it. Frogs in a boiling pot.
2021-06-19 23:15:57,wallstreetbets,For rolling out and up do you just buy to close your current CC and then immediately sell another CC at a higher price?
2021-06-20 17:39:28,wallstreetbets,I just wanted to have the whole screen with green indicators and the numbers always going up. I just wanted the best for him or her.

2021-06-19 22:41:19,wallstreetbets,"An option can be exercised ITM, ATM, or OTM. The Option Buyer may lose money OTM, ATM, and even ITM but they may call those shares away if they got the cash."
2021-06-20 03:33:54,wallstreetbets,"I was looking at the lil graph thingie on P/L, and when you sell a call the graph says after the breakeven, there can be unlimited losses occurred. Does this not happen if the stock price rises, as I've heard you get the premium+whatever the call contract you're assigned for nets you from the shares you've sold. And if I sell a call, do I not pay the premium to sell it in the first place if I have 100 shares?"
2021-06-19 20:09:44,wallstreetbets,Wendy's general manager
2021-06-20 13:21:15,wallstreetbets,Did you roll those calls up and out to retain some premium or did you just straight lose the shares?
2021-06-20 11:42:26,wallstreetbets,How much did you lose?
2021-06-20 18:04:21,wallstreetbets,"Smart move op, congrats.


Yet you can never be 100% sure the stock is not about to break your calls.

What were your thoughts on the stock not moving for a while?"
2021-06-20 11:00:12,wallstreetbets,"You're right. Bad times are a coming. By the way I didn't mean to shit on you, because that's a nice win you have there so big congrats. May I ask how much you have invested in that position where you're able to make 5k a month just from covered calls? At least if it's a lot, like 50k+ then it would at least seem kind of reasonable."
2021-06-19 23:38:45,wallstreetbets,Yes. Higher strike and/or farther out expiration. You can do this in one rolling order. A single order.
2021-06-20 17:12:16,wallstreetbets,"That makes more sense.  Congratulations on being retired, we all live that dream till we get there."
2021-06-20 18:55:17,wallstreetbets,"You always keep the premium no matter what if the calls get sold / filled.  If the call gets exercised, the shares you own get sold at the strike price.  You should always pick a strike price that you are comfortable selling at.  
You can always close out the contract yourself by buying the call at that that strike price, whenever you want (before expiration obviously), if you think the stock will go up more.  You’ll have to pay the difference in premium, but you keep the 100 shares."
2021-06-20 04:42:15,wallstreetbets,"You always keep the premium when you sell a CC. If they expire ITM there is a good chance you get assigned and you have to sell the shares at the strike price.      
If the strike price is higher than the price you bought the shares then you make profit as well when being assigned on top of the premium you received when selling the call.       

The risks are pretty simple:      
- the stocks goes well beyond your strike price meaning that when you sell your shares at the strike price you are missing on gains you could have made if you had sold at market price.     
- the stock value crashes down, but this is the same risk as holding any stock."
2021-06-20 10:44:15,wallstreetbets,"When you sell a CC it shows potential loss unlimited because the price of the stock can go up to infinity. If your strike is$50 and the stock goes up to $500,000 your loss would be $499,950 X 100 shares = $49,995,000 even though you made money it show potential loss opportunity."
2021-06-20 15:52:06,wallstreetbets,"Technically they didn’t really lose money per se. Only lost on opportunity. They missed out on the potential gains they would have made had they not sold the calls. Well, unless they sold the calls naked."
2021-06-20 03:10:31,wallstreetbets,I sell naked AMC and GME calls all the time. All you need is level 4 permissions from your broker. Standard broker option margin rules apply.
2021-06-20 15:42:12,wallstreetbets,I wasn’t offended by it. It’s all good. I have $30K.
2021-06-19 22:43:44,wallstreetbets,"1. You may not be assigned. Likely it will be but the clearinghouse may or may not assign you. Expect to be.

2. Your shares can be assigned and called away before expiration and out the money. It may not make sense to do that but the buyer has the right to do so. Again, it is Unlikely but does happen."
2021-06-20 10:35:45,wallstreetbets,You keep 100% of the premium that you sell your covered call for no matter what. If your covered call expires in the money your shares will be exercised and you lose the 100 shares you used to cover it and get paid 100 X strike price
2021-06-20 19:01:43,wallstreetbets,"Ahhh. Ok makes much more sense to me now thank you , I’ll go tuck my self now"
2021-06-20 13:20:20,wallstreetbets,"oh okay, so its showing the stock price without your 100 shares and premium involved?"
2021-06-20 12:03:16,wallstreetbets,"Get approved to sell options. Sell calls with 1-2 week expiration on anything you own 100+ shares of, 1 call per 100 shares at a strike price you'd feel happy to let the stock go at if the strike price were hit and you got assigned to sell the shares. If the strike price isn't hit by expiration, you keep the premium and your shares. If the strike price gets hit and holds until expiration or it gets exercised before expiration by the call holder, you sell the shares at a price you're happy with selling at and still keep the premium. Basically you let your shares make you extra money. Rinse and repeat."
2021-06-20 18:46:01,wallstreetbets,">unless they sold the calls naked.

Yeah that's what I was curious about."
2021-06-20 15:15:35,wallstreetbets,Right you need level 4 permission.
2021-06-19 22:50:23,wallstreetbets,"Yea early assignment blows. It can def happen but it’s super unlikely. At expiration though your sold call will get assigned, always. Your 100 shares will be called away."
2021-06-20 15:17:11,wallstreetbets,Right. Which means you miss out on the potential gains had you just held the shares
2021-06-19 22:47:53,wallstreetbets,"Most likely yes. Keep in mind even if an option is ITM at market close 4pm, it can fall out of the money even way out in after hours trading. Options settlement usually take place the following day over the weekend. On a covered call that only means you lose out on some potential, it'd be rare to lose money unless the asset dropped like a rock. You got the premium but the stock could go next to worthless. really unlikely after hours but never say never."
2021-06-20 15:49:57,wallstreetbets,"And should you decide you actually don’t want to let them go for your strike price you can just roll your option, and give it more time."
2021-06-19 23:21:39,wallstreetbets,"I say may not because there are always outliers. You just never know. Like I said, always expect to be."
2021-06-20 18:20:21,wallstreetbets,"But if you've been able to sell Covered Calls expiring worthless every week for over a month now, your average cost is very negative."
2021-06-20 00:00:09,wallstreetbets,"There are some securities that do settle later than close but most, including amc, are settled by your broker based on the price at market close."
2021-06-20 16:15:40,wallstreetbets,"Yes, definitely this too, good advice!"
2021-06-19 23:37:24,wallstreetbets,"But seriously though that’s not true. All ITM options are automatically exercised at expiration. Long or short they all get exercised. Only way to avoid that is to close the position before market close on Friday (expiration day). With a short option there is risk of early assignment also. But “automatic exercise” and “automatic assignment” occurs for all ITM options, long or short."
2021-06-19 22:50:29,wallstreetbets,"Get in how? As the writer of the call you're committing to sell shares you already own away (naked calls aside.) 

If you bought a call you're paying strike plus premium.

To acquire shares a little cheaper you'd write a put and buy the shares once it falls ITM."
2021-06-20 12:03:59,wallstreetbets,Automatic assignment doesn't always occur.  Assignments are done in lottery fashion. Automatic exercise depends on the brokerage.
2021-06-19 22:55:31,wallstreetbets,You’re absolutely right I misread that last comment
2021-06-20 15:18:25,wallstreetbets,Do some research you will find that this is not correct.

2021-06-20 18:57:05,wallstreetbets,"I’ve found this to be true.  The majority of brokerages will *automatically* exercise options if they are ITM at expiration, to prevent the contracts from expiring worthless."
2021-06-20 16:03:32,wallstreetbets,Wow the only extremely rare exception. Congrats.
2021-06-20 16:19:08,wallstreetbets,"Extremely rare exception, however, you keep telling everyone 100% of the time.  This is just not the truth as evidenced by this example.  

I'm not sure why you are congratulating me, or are you trying to be facetious?"
2021-06-20 17:20:12,wallstreetbets,"No I’m not being facetious. However, that one extremely rare exception is arbitrary. It doesn’t apply to 99.9% of options trades so it doesn’t concern me honestly"
2021-06-20 18:59:26,wallstreetbets,After hours assignments suck.  Always close out your positions before 4PM on the Friday that they expire by buying the contracts back.

2021-06-20 13:02:17,wallstreetbets,Seriously: Refinancing your home to buy stocks (not options retards!) is normally a good play. Mortgage rates are very low and the stock market typically destroys those rates with ease.

2021-06-20 15:09:06,wallstreetbets,There is life outside AMC
2021-06-19 20:10:03,wallstreetbets,Both of you are correct
2021-06-20 09:40:22,wallstreetbets,More like this is a bot or some other bad actor
2021-06-19 21:42:20,wallstreetbets,All of those other 200 share posts aren’t real Yolos? You don’t say!
2021-06-20 06:53:44,wallstreetbets,Like you do only live once. But living once having lost your house and any wealth as a way to enjoy that life seems pretty crap.
2021-06-20 00:56:17,wallstreetbets,... not yet.
2021-06-20 09:01:21,wallstreetbets,Well he’s slightly retarded. Shouldn’t the YOLO only be $350k?
2021-06-20 17:25:10,wallstreetbets,He could be up 100M he'd still be retarded

2021-06-20 10:36:59,wallstreetbets,Doesn’t work that way with compounding interest on a mortgage unfortunately….good luck tards

2021-06-19 23:19:45,wallstreetbets,Lots of those for karma farming
2021-06-20 12:15:44,wallstreetbets,Almost certainly fake.
2021-06-19 22:25:38,wallstreetbets,Yeah but people worked 15 hours a day in meat packing plants and lost three fingers because there were no laws about how employees were treated and if you got injured you were fired on the spot so $5 seemed like a fortune for most people who just got off the boat with nothing but a change of clothes and pack of cigarettes.  There were zero days off and no benefits whatsoever and if you had heat at all at home it was luxurious.  So I think she paid her dues.
2021-06-20 10:51:00,wallstreetbets,They could issue more shares.
2021-06-20 07:19:37,wallstreetbets,"While that is true we are talking about a chinese company so there is always the risk that they might pull a luckin coffee.

Small risk, but it is there."

2021-06-19 20:45:49,wallstreetbets,I put money into Wish so I’m not knocking it. But it’s definitely not the internet’s dollar tree. Dollar tree won’t tell you something is a dollar and then charge you $15 dollars for shipping. And then make you wait a few months to get it.
2021-06-20 12:03:16,wallstreetbets,So stay the fuck in your amc lane
2021-06-19 22:15:55,wallstreetbets,"Yep.

There are thousands of people for every meme stock that say “no dude this one is serious, this is the one that’s undervalued and will double EOY.” Could be true, but it’s still a meme stock. Volatility is all over the place and it shot up what, 50% in one day when this sub first talked about it?"
2021-06-20 02:49:52,wallstreetbets,Two types of WISH traders lol.
2021-06-19 23:44:09,wallstreetbets,Wish is a shit company giving shit product and I don't know anyone who uses it. So yah I want to be a short seller and short them.
2021-06-19 23:23:12,wallstreetbets,Yeah but he's up 57k and the total is 410k. 410k-57k does not equal 400k.
2021-06-20 17:30:53,wallstreetbets,Then you're gonna be rich for a good 24 hour lol

That's the market where they operate and therefore the market where they could and would cook their books.

Go on and tell me with a straight face that these aren't some dodgy MFers."

The whole industry is seriously different than it was in '08, and most people are overpaying but not by more than they can afford. Almost no 5/1s or liar loans like there were last time, and lending requirements are way stricter than they used to be."

2021-06-19 20:01:54,wallstreetbets,Because I'm sick of idiots spreading their idiocy? Or because you got called a shill for shilling while calling someone with a real opinion a shill?

2021-06-20 06:54:22,wallstreetbets,Wish is not a meme stock .. Amazom tried to buy them for 10B .. this is not AMC or GME with dying business models
2021-06-19 23:16:52,wallstreetbets,"The technicals are there, there's more traders out there than WSB you know"
2021-06-20 07:56:32,wallstreetbets,A *lot* of people use wish.
2021-06-20 02:18:53,wallstreetbets,That didn’t stop GME or AMC.
2021-06-20 06:52:56,wallstreetbets,You must not know any poor people or anyone with kids .. i know a lot of people who use it .. and the billions in sales says you must not know many people lol.
2021-06-20 11:36:19,wallstreetbets,"I agree with you that its a shit company, but no way in hell id ever take a short position on a meme stock."
2021-06-20 02:11:21,wallstreetbets,Go for it....after it hits 20
2021-06-20 05:46:15,wallstreetbets,"Dude yes, BUT I get updates from wish being that I was a seller and they bought large warehouses on the east coast and in Europe so they can offer free same day shipping. The founder knows he will never beat Amazon and is only focused on the broke dicks."
2021-06-20 10:45:20,wallstreetbets,"Good point, I literally do not know a single person who uses the WISH website"
2021-06-20 00:13:44,wallstreetbets,How are you making numbers little numbers into bigger numbers and reading what I say to my  iPhone after I push the dildo on the bottom right of the screen

WISH is fundamentally and technically sound at this level, not some goofy WSB play."
2021-06-20 13:32:12,wallstreetbets,Meme stock doesn’t imply dying or failing business at all
2021-06-20 13:09:20,wallstreetbets,"Remind me about gme's outdated business model by eoy... They literally plan on going from brick and mortar, past ecommerce straight to tech.... How is that out modeled. They have almost no execs from previous board.. it's a whole new company"
2021-06-20 01:14:25,wallstreetbets,Are those other traders refinancing their house to put everything into it? Because I feel like you’re overlooking that
2021-06-20 14:45:08,wallstreetbets,"Most people are not going to tell you they use WISH. Shopping at WISH is like shopping at the dollar store. Society has attached this stigma to it that it is for lower class people therefore people most people would feel ashamed to share that they shop there. When is the last time someone told you about them shopping at the dollar store? They may have not told you but they do it. Both WISH and the dollar store are striving businesses who are fundamentally and financially sound. Don't judge a book by its cover and don't go based off what everyone else is doing. WISH is an undervalued company.

\*\*I am not a financial advisor please don't take this as investment advice, retard.\*\*"
2021-06-20 01:28:51,wallstreetbets,"You make a strong point, can't argue with you there."
2021-06-20 01:24:46,wallstreetbets,">People will lose 20-30% + of value which will make A LOT of homeowners upside down, when that happens foreclosures start.

No, they don't. Foreclosures start when you've missed several payments. The owner of your mortgage doesn't give a rat's engorged cock if you're upside down or not as long as your payments come in on time. And home owners don't just stop making payments as soon as they go negative equity because you still live there, and if you could afford the payments before (most people in this boom can,) then you can still afford then even if your theoretical equity tanks. 

Foreclosures don't just happen. Holy shit, where are you morons getting this?"
2021-06-20 11:55:03,wallstreetbets,"Please explain for someone not in the real estate or mortgage business. If someone goes upside down in regard to home value, why would they stop making their mortgage payments. I can understand their resentment, but why would the value drop force foreclosure? Most people who finance new cars are upside down on them as soon as they leave the lot. This does not trigger automatic repossessions."
2021-06-19 20:04:41,wallstreetbets,"Lol yes and everyone who call you out or disagrees with you ONE time is psychotic. You're a fragile little thing, aren't you?"
2021-06-20 11:53:21,wallstreetbets,Oh fuck im gonna ***niiiiiine***
2021-06-20 11:21:27,wallstreetbets,I'm in to deep to get out now
2021-06-20 09:35:37,wallstreetbets,with that i must concur .. long play for sure.. looking to get in that at some point.
2021-06-20 10:40:48,wallstreetbets,It's shit.
2021-06-20 13:33:39,wallstreetbets,Most meme stocks are dying hence the short interest.
2021-06-20 13:32:59,wallstreetbets,Yea a 1000x run up of a stock might reboot a companies businesa model .. nothing you said has anything to do with the changes GME is making .. it was dying untill Reddit ran up the stock price .. WISH is in a totally different situation
2021-06-20 02:00:13,wallstreetbets,"I never said that was smart, I'm just saying Wish is a solid play and not just a ""meme stock""."

2021-06-20 10:43:18,wallstreetbets,It's not. You're shit at reading charts and info about the company.
2021-06-20 13:36:17,wallstreetbets,"Meme stock literally just means a stock that’s surging due to a viral retail frenzy, stop getting butthurt on behalf of a ticker"

2021-06-20 02:06:45,wallstreetbets,"And I never said it was “just a meme stock”, so why even reply?"
2021-06-20 02:38:17,wallstreetbets,"So, your comeback is ""I was a shitty broker back when every dumb motherfucker with no job prospects and half a smooth brain thought they could get rich as a broker, and now I think I know wtf I'm taking about because I take loads behind Wendy's to pay the bills since I'm too fucking stupid to be employable""?

Tell me, oh wise call center mortgage salesman, how do you think a mortgage going upside down possibly causes a foreclosure?"
2021-06-20 11:47:20,wallstreetbets,Might as well rub some shakras on the screen while you look at your charts.
2021-06-20 13:37:09,wallstreetbets,I know what it means ..
2021-06-20 13:57:16,wallstreetbets,Also idc about wish. They sell terrible quality merchandise. I've been ripped off many times. I hope they go out of business tbh.  Their business model is scam
2021-06-20 02:09:33,wallstreetbets,"You literally did dummy read your post again.

It's not luck. It's not ""still a memestock"". Fuck off and stop wasting my time."
2021-06-20 13:44:23,wallstreetbets,Then you see that WISH fits the description
2021-06-20 02:14:45,wallstreetbets,"“Meme stock” != “JUST a meme stock”, read my posts again dummy.

Are you going to try to say it’s not a meme stock at all? It’s been a top 5 mentioned stock in this sub for about two weeks and it shot up 50% when it got attention here. 

What do you think a meme stock is? Every single person who’s invested in one thinks their’s is special and takes it weirdly personal like this. This is a fucking casino, fuck off to r/investing if you can’t handle being made fun of"
2021-06-20 14:24:45,wallstreetbets,Incorrect.. WISH has over 90% institutional ownership.. retail is irrelevant in this case. Viral frenzy or not.
2021-06-20 02:40:29,wallstreetbets,Theres more to trading than WSB dingbat. Learn a little you'll see why it's not simply a meme.
2021-06-20 14:34:45,wallstreetbets,"That doesn’t negate its status as a meme stock at all. Any stock that gets mentioned here 1000 times a day is a meme stock. Shit literally jumped 50% over the day and after-hours when it first got increased attention on this sub. BB is a meme stock, CLNE is a meme stock, WKHS is a meme stock. And their valuation is wholly irrelevant to that fact, and thousands of people will jump in and say “well but the one I’m invested in is special because…”

I’ve never once implied that WISH is overvalued or made any comment about its potential. I’m making fun of this dude for putting 100% of his money into a single stock that’s in vogue at the moment. Why are you guys taking this so personally? Are you really that worried about 100 people seeing my comment and thinking it’s going to negatively affect your investment or something?"
2021-06-20 03:21:11,wallstreetbets,"> Learn a little you'll see why it's not simply a meme.

Holy fuck are you illiterate?

2021-06-20 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"NVDIA DD: Undervalued and why it will continue to run To start off I do have a position in NVIDIA but nonetheless the reason for this DD is strictly information not persuasive. I truly believe NVIDIA is *undervalued* currently. ***I believe NVDIA will reach 800 pre-split (200 post 4-1 split) with the current momentum going for the stock along with a shift to tech soon.***

 If you didn't know already, NVIDIA designs graphics processing units for the gaming and professional markets, as well as system on a chip units for the mobile computing and automotive market. 

*EARNINGS* 

**NVIDIA recently had its earnings report in which they reported $3.66 earnings per share for the quarter, beating the consensus estimate of $3.28 by $0.38.** They recorded revenue of $5.66 billion, up 84 percent from a year earlier and up 13 percent from the previous quarter, with record revenue from the company’s Gaming, Data Center and Professional Visualization platforms. Gaming revenue of $2.76 billion, up 106 percent from a year earlier. Record Data Center revenue of $2.05 billion, up 79 percent from a year earlier. 

## Quarterly Earnings Surprise Amount

**Fiscal Quarter End| Date Reported | Earnings Per Share\*| Consensus EPS\* Forecast | % Surprise**

**Apr 2021.                    05/26/2021                  3.13                                     2.62**                                **19.47%**

**Jan 2021                      02/24/2021                  2.58                                      2.2                                  17.27%**

**Oct 2020                     11/18/2020                   2.41                                     1.92                                25.52%**

**Jul 2020                       08/19/2020                  1.67                                     1.63                                 2.45%**

As you can see over the past four quarterly earnings NVDIA has beaten each of the projected forecasts easily for the most part. With a gross margin of 64.11% for this quarter, and an average quarterly gross margin of 60.96% over the past 5 years, NVDIA is primed to continue its dominance for the future. Also it is important to note that **NVDIA beats out its main competitors Intel and AMD in gross margins on average over the past 5 years and over the last quarter.** 

## NVDIA Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) Range, Past 5 Years

**Minimum 54.74% Jan 2019**

**Maximum 65.06% Apr 2020**

**Average 60.96%**

## AMD Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) Range, Past 5 Years

**Minimum 4.51% Sep 2016**

**Maximum 46.07% Mar 2021**

**Average 37.34%**

## Intel Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) Range, Past 5 Years

**Minimum 53.13% Sep 2020**

**Maximum 64.50% Sep 2018**

**Average 59.65%**

Now onto reasons why I think NVIDIA is a strong buy. 

1. **Price targets**

NVDIA is still undervalued with multiple price targets very much higher than the current price of what NVDIA is trading at currently along with multiple buy ratings. One example in specific, **Bank of America recently upgraded NVDIA price target to $900 from $800 and reiterated its Buy rating.** The bank said its takeaway is that ""rising AI adoption, expanding use-cases across cloud, enterprise, edge, telco can help NVDA double its content and triple its data center sales over the next few years."" Bank of America said it expects NVIDIA's data center business to grow at a 35% compounded rate to become its largest segment by year-end 2025. Other notable price targets include 854- Jefferies, 800- Robert W Baird, 800- Rosenblatt Securities. 

1. **Acquisition of ARM**

 ARM can’t stay independent for long, even the CEO thinks so. Arm CEO Simon Segars made the case that if it stays independent, Arm wouldn’t be able to keep up with the increasing demands of its customers for more complex chips that can perform a wider variety of functions. The simple solution? Getting acquired by another company. NVIDIA seems to be in the lead to acquire ARM and other rivals are terrified. They have a good reason to be, as NVDIA already a strong leader wants to spend $40 billion to acquire U.K. chip technology provider Arm Holdings. This acquisition will reshape the industry entirely. NVIDIA CEO, Jensen Huang said the acquisition of ARM is an opportunity to create a company that can generate even more new ideas, and bring more innovation to its customers in the form of intellectual property. A quote in specific, “The benefit to the market, and to the Arm customers will be more IP, better IP, more accelerated road maps and hopefully taking Arm to the far reaches of what is becoming …the diversity of computing that is literally going in every single direction,” Huang said. “You’re covering everything from cloud, to edge, to \[internet of things\], to high performance computing, to microprocessors, to accelerated computing—everything.”

2. **Internet currency ( Not allowed to say actual word so replaced it with internet)**

GPU’s can be used for internet currency and its mining purposes. It’s possible to blame the graphic card shortage on these miners but nonetheless, the usage of them is highly prevalent today. NVIDIA's releases of processors specifically used for mining poses a huge boost to its revenue and to the internet currency world. **NVIDIA booked $155 million in revenue from CMP cards in its fiscal first quarter.** While internet money is gaining traction around the world, we can expect NVIDIA to continue its dominance and reliability in mining purposes. 

3. **Stock split** 

On May 21st, NVIDIA announced a 4-1 stock split which would take place on July 19th. So for every one share you own, you will own four instead as the stock splits its price valuation by four. On the day of the news, NVIDIA’s stock price closed at $599.67. **Since then, the price of NVIDIA’s stock has gone up around 24% to $743.75**. Not even one month has passed and the stock is up 24%! With one full month until the split **I predict NVDIA to hit $800 or/and above by the time of the official split**. Call options and shares in my opinion are the way to go for the next month as this could be a great opportunity to invest in a fast growth company. 

4. **Growth** 

NVIDIA has been a great growth tech stock to own recently with the numbers backing this statement up. 

**NVIDIA RETURNS** 

YTD: +223.35 (+42.77%)

1 Year: +376.83 (+102.20%)

6 Months: +214.67 (+40.44%)

1 Month: +184.92 (+32.98%)

Now for the returns on NVIDIA compared to AMD and INTEL. 

**NVIDIA RETURNS**

1 Year: +376.83 (+102.20%)

6 Months: +214.67 (+40.44%)

**NVIDIA beats Intel and AMD in every single category growth wise showing complete dominance with its stock price.** 

Concluding I believe NVIDIA is a must buy presplit and the risk is minimum. The stock shows solid uptrend with extreme growth to come. NVIDIA is a strong buy in my personal opinion and an amazing company to be invested in. "

AMD is trading around 10x earnings lots of positive rumors around them going to 5nm production and 3D architecture.  Basically AMD will be able to fit more in their GPUs then anyone else.  Look for the next gen AMD GPUs to surpass NVDA"

2021-06-20 13:37:37,wallstreetbets,"I've been wondering about NVDIA as a long term play. 

Internet money might go up or down this year, depending on what the dice say, but ether is going to stop requiring GPUs this year or die trying. As the most (and often only) profitable internet money to mine via GPU, a large swath of GPU owners will suddenly find themselves with cards that can't turn a profit. What happens to NVDIA's retail when the secondary market is absolutely flooded with ex-mining cards?

Sure, a lot of people don't want cards that have been mined with, but you can't tell by looking at them. Costs will come down rapidly, gamers, coders, and anyone else with a use for a graphics card will find the cost of used high performance cards tempting. 

Additionally, because of the major selloff of heavily used cards, NVDIA'S reputation may suffer. Imagine buying a 3080 that craps out on you in a year because some shithead mined it into the ground and resold for half off? You might think twice before getting another one from them."
2021-06-20 18:14:44,wallstreetbets,NVDIA is very overvalued currently. It just about overbought on the RSI & is currently looking to testing is 50 day moving average. This is not a good play & should reverse shortly especially with market uncertaininity ramping up again with inlfation concerns good luck but i do not agree
2021-06-20 07:45:14,wallstreetbets,This is a good idea. Good bot

2021-06-20 12:55:44,wallstreetbets,"NVDA has a lot more data business than AMD I’m pretty sure, also it seems like the NVDA fan club is also a cult haha check out r/NVIDIA"
2021-06-20 17:03:13,wallstreetbets,I think you mean a year late. I've had them since spring last year and I've recently sized them down quite a bit due to the extreme SP growth since then (3x in a little bit more than a year). AMD seems like the more safe play at the moment.
2021-06-20 18:22:24,wallstreetbets,"AMD GPUs will surpass NVDAs... However, what NVDA has going for them is CUDA.

The sheer amount of professional applications that are using this language is phenominal. Until there is a alternative, which is easy to port to from CUDA, and just as performant, NVDA has a stranglehold on those industries."
2021-06-20 17:11:05,wallstreetbets,"I don't think they're going to surpass NVDA any time soon due to NVDA being much more experienced with software, and they like to make it dependent on their hardware. CPUs and B2B GPUs are where AMD shines.

They're growing in the CPU market and they're starting to penetrate the DC CPU market, the supercomputer GPU market, the car market (with TSLA, can likely spread to other manufacturers), and the mobile market (with Samsung, can also spread to other manufacturers if they show superiority to ARM).

Xilinx might bring a lot of experience to their software department, but my guess is that it could possibly take years to get running."
2021-06-19 21:11:42,wallstreetbets,Buy amd and it the cheaper version of nivida lol
2021-06-20 17:18:14,wallstreetbets,Eff is definitely not the only interweb currency making use of GPUs.
2021-06-20 16:29:15,wallstreetbets,"Since there is a shortage, I'm pretty sure AMD have been prioritizing B2B and higher margin business aka data centers, consoles and supercomputers.

It is easier for Nvidia to scale up GPU production since they are only making GPUs. Remember that virtually all consumer GPUs that are created will get sold at the moment, so the market share at the moment simply reflects who can create the most GPUs."

2021-06-20 16:43:51,wallstreetbets,"Yeah sure. I do own both AMD and NVDA (AMD in larger size at the moment), but if you compare PEG for example, NVDA has about 3x AMDs PEG. AMD has a lot more space to grow in their current TAM than NVDA and currently grows at about the same pace as NVDA yet is valued a LOT lower than NVDA."
2021-06-20 11:38:24,wallstreetbets,Just hating bitches that didn’t get in on the play what else is new
2021-06-20 14:06:25,wallstreetbets,Record date just “marks” the shares as entitled to the three additional shares on the ex date. The shares keep that right even if they change hands after the 21st.
2021-06-20 14:05:12,wallstreetbets,"The stocks are pretty much stapled with the entitlement to three additional shares, so any shares you’d buy would still split on the ex date."
2021-06-20 17:07:29,wallstreetbets,"They are both long term plays for me. I see AMD dominating the market for years to come and Nvidia is expanding into data centers. I'm very positive about both of these companies. Due to the silicone shortages they can more or less charge what they want for high end products.

It's investing and I bought both because I believe they're both going to do very well."
2021-06-19 20:18:19,wallstreetbets,"It would be literally impossible for INTC to grow by 60%, unless the entire semiconductor market grew by that much in a year.

In this market share price is driven by future growth

Intel aint fucking paying you its profits as a retail shareholder and dont even bring up the shitty dividend"
2021-06-20 16:39:02,wallstreetbets,"Growing that fast requires expanding your TAM like all the big tech companies such as AMZN, MSFT, APPL do. NVDA has been doing that with their Data Center / AI business. Why is it literally impossible for INTC to do the same?"
2021-06-19 21:32:31,wallstreetbets,"The point is that NVDA would have to grow at 60% for the next 3 years strait, which it absolutely will not do, to get to INTC revenue, yet it is valued double that of INTC today.


The growth NVDA had this past year was extraordinary, no doubt, but so was this past year in general. They will not see this kind of growth going forward.

Also, a divided is literally paying its profits to the retail holder. Lol."
2021-06-20 19:39:36,wallstreetbets,"Because that would be 47 billion in Revenue growth, that is like the size of a fully matured product market. To do that in a single year would be off the charts.

I think the only company in history to long growth like that is Amazon, and they did it by absorbing an already massive category, away from hundreds of other companies, into their own business. 

Frankly, I doubt the raw material supply chains exist to even support that amount of growth."
2021-06-19 21:47:59,wallstreetbets,"I said dont bring up its shitty dividend. Accordingly, this will be last response to educate you. Im going to explain this to you in retard simplicity.

You are going to give someone $100. You have two options. One person says you give me $100 ill give you $110 next year. The other says you give me $100 ill give you $160 next year. Who do you give your seed money too?

2021-06-20 10:02:20,wallstreetbets,"Talking about revenue growth, you retard. And you just think NVDA can just randomly be valued as much as facebook by the end of the year? A company that  makes 5x the revenue, and 7.5x the profits? Wtf are you smoking?"

Everything else is jibberish to fill the post. No need to read from here its just going to be my diary.

Went out with a girl last night. Total whackadoodle. Nut job. She threatened to chloroform me on tinder before we ever met. So naturally I was completely into her.

Her pictures are ok but we meet in person and shes a babe. She comes back to my place and we play boggle and watch a movie while eating chinese food. Some kissing but not much. She holds my hand and cuddles into me and falls asleep.

I wake her up and walk her out to her uber. Text her this morning saying we should go out again. She says she doesnt want to. What the hell?

She did say last night that she feels you should interpret peoples actions as a reflection of them, not of you. Still sucks though. Dating blows.

Hopefully that is enough text automod you slut.

2021-06-19 20:39:52,wallstreetbets,Sorry about the date. Sounds like she just wasn’t into you.
2021-06-19 20:48:04,wallstreetbets,Maybe she accidentally chloroformed herself and slumped into you. You were a prize kill that got away. Maybe. But dating definitely blows.

Didn’t it feel good that she fell asleep on you? Maybe you should let her at least sleep on the couch 😂 Either way hit her up and apologize and tell her this warm blooded autistic Ape you don’t know on WSB told you to have a second date on me!

If some posts a call on Intel and bets yet doesn't post anything to back it up, they're full of 💩 until shown otherwise. 

An why would Intel go to $100 all of a sudden? Just based on semiconductor short? 

If anything, I'd would think Intel would start seeing benefits from the autonomous drive data set it is building out with multiple car companies."
2021-06-19 23:34:23,wallstreetbets,Who in the fuck in there right mind would think Intel would climb anywhere near $100 again?
2021-06-20 00:25:13,wallstreetbets,That was a really stupid bet to say boomer stock Intel would go up regardless
2021-06-20 01:17:58,wallstreetbets,Intel is getting crushed by it's competition lately. Not sure why anyone would think that lol
2021-06-20 10:10:55,wallstreetbets,"What kind of fucking idiot bets on Intel doubling their valuation in 6 months? It's going to be years before Intels manufacturing investments pay off, and their current offerings are passable at best at every point in the product stack compared to AMD and apple.

This is from someone who own Intel stock lmao."
2021-06-20 15:41:38,wallstreetbets,Anyone who knows anything about tech knows not to touch Intel right now. They restructured their R&D in the last 10 years and have been struggling to keep up with 3rd party phabs. They fucked themselves and have lost ground to AMD. They have done well to make chicken salad from chicken shit but they really need to diversify their offerings into something that can make profits in the medium-long term. If I were running Intel right now I'd be doing something like looking more into RISC-V and buying Sifive and trying to use your expertise to make a killer offering for that platform and targetting low power lower cost devices as well as making an alternative to Apple's current strategy on desktop. They still have money to turn their shit around but they need to be creative and I don't think the company can be creative at least if they keep their current downward trend.

2021-06-19 23:05:36,wallstreetbets,That’s not necessary. FDs are going to be cheaper and less likely to print. Leaps are going to cost more but have more chance to print. What I would argue is hold to expiry. Easy to take a 5% loss on a 2 minute trade.

2021-06-20 14:12:52,wallstreetbets,"I don't discount them completely. When I wrote ""Intel are done for"" what I really mean is they're doomed in the long-term based on current trends. But they could always pull some surprises, who knows?

The chip shortage is a problem, and as a result there is a political desire from the Biden administration to reduce reliance on Asian fabs and support American fabs. But the chip shortage is not sufficient for Intel to close the gap. Firstly, most chips used in IoT devices are ARM-based, not x86, so unless Intel can produce ARM and do it better and cheaper than TSMC, they won't win over customers from the Asian fabs. Secondly, the chip shortage is expected to end by late 2022/2023, and Intel will only just have arrived at 7nm process, while TSMC will already have done 3nm (which could feature in the rumored, notchless iPhone 14).

In recent years, Intel actually lost many of their best engineers to other companies to competitors. This was pointed out by Dan Loeb in his letter to Intel. One proposal for improving Intel's issues is separation of chip design and manufacturing, but this will likely run into regulatory and political hurdles, especially under the Biden administration and with the chip shortage.  

What is the future of American semiconductor industry? Take look at a company called SiFive. They are the world leader in RISC-V chips, which could eventually supersede ARM. I believe x86 will eventually lose all market share to ARM, and RISC-V will become THE alternative to ARM, especially if Nvidia successfully purchase ARM from SoftBank."

2021-06-20 14:48:48,wallstreetbets,"They aren't. AMD (actually TSMC) ""7nm"" is a 10nm process, and actually less logic dense, t/mm² than Intel 14nm on the actual silicon. 7nm is just a marketing term, otherwise how could a chip that's 4x less dense compete for so long?

Furthermore, Intel already has 10nm on the market, just not for consumer desktop. Laptops are WAY more important for the company, and Intel is still demolishing the laptop game. 

Intel is a great buy right now, especially as AMD's next meaningful launch is likely late 2022, whereas Intel is about to drop a whole new stack on a whole new process in the next 4 months, as well as announcing fabrication contracts, and they just dropped the dead weight SSD division. The company is looking very good for the next two to three quarters."

2021-06-20 05:30:11,wallstreetbets,That was a hit piece for short sellers to make a nice scalp.  Total fraudulent bullshit.  All of it.

2021-06-19 22:57:18,wallstreetbets,"Nah, she'll be with some other stud that is blowing her back out."
2021-06-20 11:49:22,wallstreetbets,I need you to guarantee your guarantee with a 10k yolo or drinking your own piss… in spirit of this thread.
2021-06-20 02:12:34,wallstreetbets,That will definitely NOT help.
2021-06-19 23:10:45,wallstreetbets,Ahh the old smoothie butthole trick. I’m going to have to try that one out.
2021-06-20 11:31:32,wallstreetbets,"Thats the part that throws me for a loop. She held my hand no vice versa. She cuddled into me not vice versa. Im 33. Banging is a thing you can do and just get up and never talk to the girl again. Holding hands is more intimate. At least, in my view. I am 100% not ready to get back into a relationship having gotten out of a 5.5 year relationship last week, but she did change me to 99% not ready which I wasnt expecting. I dont know, clearly im missing something."
2021-06-19 23:15:21,wallstreetbets,The rejects are just rehearsal for future dates

2021-06-19 21:44:23,wallstreetbets,I have a very dumbass question. What is FD ?
2021-06-20 00:49:33,wallstreetbets,"47 😆 it was gamble, but my date is 7/2 so I got time. BUT as of now SPY at 413.. if it drops to around 405, UVXY will be at 60$ or so. It was shot in the dark but with all the reverse repo talk seemed like a decent bet."
2021-06-19 22:10:22,wallstreetbets,Intc will probably never see that again.  CHIPS AND SOFTWARE in the 90s was all driven by future growth.  Now they are more of a mature stock.  And the PC world then went oh shit with the smartphone and the cousin...the tablet. And suddenly we talked about Apps and clouds not software.   As somebody who was following all of this in the 1990s it turned out a bit different than we predicted.
2021-06-20 15:56:00,wallstreetbets,"They may never get up from this. The only Fab player that ""sucxesfully"" spun out its foundries is AMD. And that was reeeeally close to bankrupty. Intel has too big a foundry business to try to sell it. They have to make something nobody has ever done before, regain the node advantage after losing it. 

I think we witnessed peak Intel last year. From then it's all downhill to bankruptcy or irrelevance"
2021-06-19 22:07:23,wallstreetbets,"I remember the days of Micron being the big play. But for about 15 years, buy and hold Intc, msft and Amzn was golden.  And Aapl after the big dip.  Tech was super overvalued."

2021-06-19 23:07:41,wallstreetbets,"You know what, despite the comments here, it was a really nice date. I was kinda expecting it to be really sexual but instead it was fun and kind of romantic. I mean, obviously it didnt go well in the end, but for my part I had a surprisingly good time."
2021-06-20 07:16:17,wallstreetbets,"Yeah because the only way to have sex is to sexually assault people, stop projecting your creepy vibe on other people"
2021-06-19 23:24:58,wallstreetbets,">well done for not sexually assaulting her

I did not catch that part of the recap."
2021-06-19 21:22:01,wallstreetbets,True 😂
2021-06-20 14:33:25,wallstreetbets,"Agreed that reliance on aging x86 hurts - at some point companies must pivot away from their cash cows or get crushed by innovation.

As a chip design and fabrication company (one of the few left in US), Intel still has opportunities to innovate in the NEXT generation tech - materials like carbon, graphene - and newer architectures that can arise out of it (move away from traditional caches/memories). 

I'm reminded of the MHz war and the end of Moore's law with the transition to core count, and now process technology being the dominant gauge of success. The reality of it all is it's always been about power consumption specifically to optimize for compute vs temperature/area. New materials can significantly modify that equation.  

Pat Gelsinger as a brilliant engineer himself understands where Intel needs to go next IMO, and what space Intel needs to compete in to stay relevant.  My thought is they've let ARM hold the embedded space for a reason - my guess is the margins aren't there and it's a pure volume play, compared to data center CPUs.

FWIW not currently invested in Intel, but have been in the past and will likely jump back in if it drops under 50."

2021-06-19 21:15:02,wallstreetbets,52wk high is $68.49 on 4/09/21
2021-06-19 20:03:57,wallstreetbets,"Yea they are in a slump right now, too much time sitting around enjoying being the top dog and forgetting how to innovate. Plus add switching CEOs a couple times and their attempt to diversify into other tech by buying a few companies right when AMD became relevant again. But with all that the fact that they seem to still be a float makes me think they have a good chance to get back in the game. How long that will take I don't know but i can easily see them get up to 100 per share by the end of the decade. Or even higher depending on how their process nodes progress."
2021-06-19 23:27:17,wallstreetbets,Intel needs to figure out their future and show it’s practical before their stock would reflect any real value gain imho

I've been out of the dating game for about 5 years now, married and all that, but I've had a few encounters with these freak chicks. 100% not worth it, great sex though"

But I say roll the dice"

Pricing right now, intel wins. Performance wise it's so close it's laughable at times. amd 7nm intel 14nm actually closer to 21nm and 24nm, various optimizations make it nearly irrelevant its so close. But yeah I'm comparing intel's last gen because they dropped the 2 cores on the new i9. I digress. Defending the Pc parts not the business model lol"

[$PLTR 1Y 1D](https://preview.redd.it/zk4dudth9a671.png?width=2229&format=png&auto=webp&s=6c9c57e3cda6ee43ed50d1d147953c3a76bcabf2)

I'll break this down color by color to make it easy for you all to understand\~

**(RED)**

This is a descending channel dating back to February. During the week of 6/1 - we managed to break it up. You will notice many other ""meme"" stocks broke a similar setup recently before launching. Notice the gap right at **31.30.** Gaps in the upper direction are (almost) always filled. We can logically conclude the goal of this descending channel break is to finally fill that gap - before deciding the next move.

**(TEAL)**

Here we have an ascending wedge coming from upside. These patterns have a bullish bias. It's not uncommon to see a small wedge/channel form on the breakout from a larger pattern. In fact - it's actually quite bullish. If we get a daily close above the upper teal line - sitting around **25.87** on Monday - it would then ""break out"", and likely trigger a much more volatile move towards that gap at **31.34.**

**(GREEN)**

Volume is trending upwards as the ascending wedge trends upwards. This is supportive of the trend and a bullish data point.

**(YELLOW)**

These are key price levels near the setup. When we are below, they are resistance - when we are above, they are support. As you can see - the nearest support below the wedge isn't until **22.70.** On a failed breakout - it's likely we don't stop dropping until we hit this. For the upside - the nearest resistance isn't until **29.94 -** this is actually a thick supply zone with multiple levels. While it's likely we go the distance and fill that gap at **31.34 -** I would unload a good bit of your position at this resistance.

\---

**(ENTRIES)**

There are two optimal entries for this setup -

1. On a trip to that point of control @ **24.53.** This is where the most business has been done in the past year and buyers/sellers like to reposition here. It's also the **low end of the wedge** \- which means below this (on a daily close) - you would look to exit, if you took this entry. This provides a very tight and favorable margin of error.
2. On a daily candle close above that upper teal line - @ **25.87** Monday - sloping up each day by about **0.06**. You would then stop out if we got a daily candle close below that same line - also providing a nice margin of error.

**(EXITS)**

1. If you took entry 1 - you would stop out on a daily candle close below **24.53.**
2. If you took entry 2 - you would stop out on a daily candle close below the teal line around **25.87** Monday sloping up each day by about **0.06.**

Both entries would target **29.94** (take 3/4 off) and then that gap at **31.34** (I would exit here).

\---

**(POSITION IDEAS)**

Safe: **08/20/2021 PLTR 30c**

Risky: **07/16/2021 PLTR 30c**

\---

Keep in mind technical analysis is a road map, not a crystal ball. I'm providing the most high probability entries & exits - with the most favorable risk/reward ratios. I am not making an absolute prediction of future prices.

2021-06-19 23:34:57,wallstreetbets,"PLTR doesn’t really meet the standards of a meme stock anymore. You probably haven’t been around long enough but PLTR was before the GME event, everyone quickly left PLTR for GME, some stayed. So yes, PLTR was a meme stock but it was short lived. Nobody on WSB wants to be into a company for 5 years to see gains so, accordingly, everyone left after the run up and when GME exploded."
2021-06-20 01:04:17,wallstreetbets,"true, WSB put the spotlight on PLTR at $8."

Ten minutes later it went from a roughly $300 purchase of one contract to $1,700. Texted my friend omw to work and showed him a shot. He told me to sell, I thought he was jealous. Surely, if it went up like that it would keep going, because, that’s how this shit works; wrong. Ended up coal-handing it…to zero.

PLTR will get my money back from the MM’s…in true WSB fashion. Because I rurned to sell now, I think.

The Gay Bears are right once every 10 or 20 years.  There's a storm brewing and this is going to be an epic collapse.  Remember retards, you can make money when stonks go down as well.  Otherwise, get out now, pick up a case of coronas, sit back in your chair and watch as it all burns down.

TLDR - Maybe not this year, maybe not next, but its all coming down and its gonna be glorious!

2. Where should we go during massive inflation you speak of? To cash? To bonds? HA! I mean we’re all retards, but that’s something else

3. The inverse trades have been maxed out and short positions at all time highs. Not a good move to short heavily shorted positions.

2021-06-20 00:05:37,wallstreetbets,"Since about 2015 I’ve been predicting a huge crash somewhere between 2020-2022. Late 2019, I could entirely see it starting in 2021 or early 2022, but then there was the unforeseen crash outside of anyones control in 2020. That delayed, *but did not prevent,* the massive crash that’s going to happen soon.

Anyways, 2024 or 2025, mark my fucking words, it’s going to be like Y2K across all job markets except tech jobs, mixed with 2008 across all residential and some commercial real estate, with a pinch of the Great Depression all around the stock market, due to everyone pulling out, making stocks fall, causing more people to pull out.

TL:DR You are correct, my respectable fellow."
2021-06-19 23:31:39,wallstreetbets,Just started buying 3x bear ETFs.  May end up being a retarded move but whatever I got a feeling that this could be epic.   This is not financial advise yada yada.
2021-06-20 14:16:01,wallstreetbets,Ehh there are plenty of people here who would see this thing drop into the abyss and not flinch. AMC dropped like 70% over the course of like 2 weeks and then just bounced right back. I’m not saying a crash can’t happen but there’s a perverse attraction to riding out and buying loss that might make this a different ride than previous market changes. You’ve got people who are up a million saying if it goes down by 50% they’ll double down. It’s wild time that is legitimately tough to contextualize.
2021-06-20 02:15:04,wallstreetbets,"Where is it from?, I think I read it in Ben Graham's book where he tells you if the shoe shine boys are telling you about the newest hottest stock you need to get out NOW."

2021-06-20 10:14:55,wallstreetbets,That’s what I have been thinking and also with getting out of Covid a lot of lending institutions are going to start to ask for payment and a lot of people might not be able to come through with the money
2021-06-19 20:49:24,wallstreetbets,"I’ll check that out, I like Hussman’s stuff but I think he has a shitty track record so people have reason to write him off"
2021-06-19 21:36:57,wallstreetbets,It's the post titled The Biggest Short. The charts are in section 2.6.
2021-06-20 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Retail investors are on pace to sink a record $1 trillion into stocks this year - and the flows have actually accelerated over the past month, JPMorgan says "
2021-06-19 21:14:50,wallstreetbets,and half of that trillion is GME
2021-06-20 00:20:14,wallstreetbets,"Funny that all these groups are basically saying that the stocks we invest in will eventually crash and ""go back to normal"". Yet the normal they are talking about only exists when retail investors aren't that active, or aggressive. We've already proven that we have decent pulling affects on the market, and that fucks with the ""stable"" (read as major players being the only influences outside of company performance and future) market. Really we aren't doing anything different than major firms do, we just don't do what they want. That's why they claim volatility. They suddenly aren't the only players and are complaining about it."
2021-06-19 22:15:42,wallstreetbets,Bought COKE back in 2001 around $40.  Ten years later I checked the price and it was around $60.  Ten years later I checked the price and it was $400.  I was told we went through a couple crashes during that time frame.  Weird.

The thing retail doesn't understand is that buying a falling knife doesn't just mean getting yourself cut. It ALSO mean you let professional traders front run you by exiting at cushy levels or at least break-even.

Do you know why double tops happens on graphs? It's because if the pros bought the first top, they still want to get out. Can you guess who buys the 2nd top thinking (not knowing) that it will go higher?

GameStop is fundamentally not a company worth 15 billion dollars. This frenzy is one massive hype train which WILL run out of steam. GameStop doesn’t offer anything to retail consumers that can’t better be serviced by a company that decided to innovate and build out a stronger platform in the early 2010s when GameStop was still adamant about being just a brick & mortar retail chain. Half of all of their locations are in shopping malls, basically a dead medium of commerce these days.

I personally have spent north of $10,000 on video games and gaming peripherals. Most of my friends have as well. Not a single one of us uses GameStop for it."

It does not accurately represent what it should be and does not present the proper legal disclaimers. As a semi-professional DD-Writer, myself, I believe that it is my duty to try and at least somewhat help you dumbass apes. Over the course of this post, I hope to create a picture of what DD is supposed to look like, as well as how to avoid responsibility when your shitty stock tanks 90% after you wrote 30 dogshit ""DDs"" per day on why it would ""go up 400% tomorrow"".

Title

---

When writing titles for Due Diligence posts, it is important to note that you must accurately encompass your entire work in a single phrase. This might sound hard - considering you're all illiterate - but it's easy. 

Let's start with the basics. Titles can vary based on the type of due diligence you are writing, but generally if you're writing analysis - fundamental or technical - you will be using the same type of title. The first word must indicate whether your analysis is 100% thorough and complete (1), or rather, if there are kinks that need to be worked out within it (2) (upcoming data, etc.). You all will most certainly be using (2). In the case of (2), you must start the title of your DD with the phrase ""Preliminary analysis"". ""Preliminary"" describes whether it is in progress or not (in this case it is) and ""analysis"" is analysis. After you have written this, you must then follow it up by saying ""...on [company name], [business structure abbreviation] ([INDEX]: [TICKER]). We write it like this to specify the company whose business we will be analyzing, as well as their home index and stock ticker. 

After this, we write who the DD is for. In the case of company analysis for that specific company, an investment bank will put the company they are analyzing in that region. Here's an example:

""Preliminary Analysis on ContextLogin, Inc. (NASDAQ: WISH) for

The Special Committee of the Constituents at WallStreetBets""

---

Legal disclaimers

---

When writing papers on stocks, it is important to note that any and all assumptions you make can be seen as a form of guaranteeing movement of a stock. For example, if I were to say, ""BlackBerry is looking like it's gonna jump 30%!!! All in!!!"", the law would consider me to be giving financial advice. It is always important to preface a piece of ""DD"" with the proper legal disclaimers, so as to prevent you from being prosecuted by illiterate apes when they lose money. 

Before you begin the body of your ""DD"", you must give two important disclaimers:

 1.) I am not a financial, accounting, tax, or legal advisor (we'll elaborate on that one in a moment)

 2.) This Due Diligence is made solely for fun/private usage, and should be considered as such. This ""DD"" is not meant to be considered as anything more than an opinion and should not be treated as definitive proof of any future events (past results are no guarantee of future performance). (we'll elaborate on this one after the first mention)

I have been seeing people use the term ""I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice."" The worst part about this is the fact that it is usually added at the end of their DD. Here are a few guidelines:

 1.) Add your disclaimers at the beginning of your DD. 

 2.) The first mentioned disclaimer should include information as to what qualifications you do NOT have. Most individuals just say either ""I am not a financial advisor"" and leave it at that, while others go a step further with ""I am not a financial or tax advisor."" The truth is that you need more than that. You must include a statement that says that you will not interfere with government authority and tax law, as well as disclosing what qualifications you do not have. And example of a proper (1) disclaimer would be:

""u/Some-other-guy-1 does not provide accounting, tax, or legal advice. Notwithstanding anything in this document to the contrary, and except as required to enable compliance with applicable securities law, you (and each of your fellow WallStreetBetters, apes, moderators, and other users) may disclose to any and all persons in the US federal income and state tax treatment and tax structure of the transaction and all materials of any kind (including tax opinions and other tax analyses) that are provided to you relating to such tax treatment and tax structure, without u/Some-other-guy-1 imposing any limitation of any kind.""

 3.) The second mentioned disclaimer should include information that states that the DD you have written is preliminary and the stock you are doing DD on is subject to change. For example:

""The information in this presentation is based upon any information supplied to me and reflects prevailing conditions and my views as of this date, of which are suspect to Change. My estimates should be regarded as indicative, preliminary and for illustrative purposes only.""

---

Body

---

Writing proper DD comes with a set of requirements on coverage of certain topics. Topics you cover in your DD should include:

 1.) Market perception

 2.) How does X stock compare to other members of its sector?

 3.) What are some of the potential market alternatives to X stock and how might they affect the value of X stock?

 4.) What alternatives may be able to overtake X stock and how might we evaluate them?

After you initiate these topics, you proceed to covering them in as much depth as possible, finding as many possible answers to them as possible.

Add a bull AND bear case. If you can't find any negatives for your penny stock, you're delusional.

---

Conclusion

---

In conclusion, I hope that this bit of guidance helps increase the quality of DD on this subreddit.

Thanks for sticking around - if you did - and have a nice day!"

2021-06-20 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Why Regal Cinemas will be the reason AMC hits $100 So as decent movies start to come out I went to the movie theater the first time last week. I went to my local Regal theater just because it's the closest theater to me. Boy was I disappointed. 


Was it understaffed? 

Yes.


Was the air conditioning working?

Not really.


Was it clean?

No.


Was the popcorn good?

No.


Was the Coke good?

NO BECAUSE THE SELL TRASH ASS PEPSI NOW.


According to every study ever done, Coke is more popular than Pepsi in the US. According to the same study, Coke has a more loyal fan base. I can deal with bad popcorn or a warm room, BUT WHO TF WANT A BLUE PEPSI CUP WHEN THEY'RE AT A MOVIE?!?!

Even my one friend who likes Pepsi admits that there's something wrong with having Pepsi at a movie theater. 

At the moment I saw the Pepsi sign I knew I was never going back to a Regal theater and will only go to the AMC further away from my house. Many more people will do the same. 


TLDR: Regal owns stock in AMC, so they started selling Pepsi so more people would go to AMC, increasing revenue, and boosting the stock price."
2021-06-19 22:03:32,wallstreetbets,"I don't know man, but my local Regal has a secret adult video showing Thursdays at 11pm. maybe yours has it too. also it sells churros."
2021-06-19 23:24:28,wallstreetbets,"The AC not being on isn’t a one off issue. Same here, went to two different regal theaters and both times the AC was off or working so little you couldn’t tell."

**FUD REMOVAL**

**CHINESE = FRAUD?**

You've made it this far but you're still not convinced since it's a Chinese company, ethics, political turmoil. Well let me tell you little sh\*t.... Remember the good ol corporate days where everyone goes like yeah Google, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon are too big to fail, they have fingers in all pies. Well guess what?! Alibaba is a conglomerate as well that invests inside and outside of China.

For examples, we have Alibaba Pictures

and....

wait for it....

**The Chinese Growth Story**

Math and big braining

Low Labor+ High Out Put + High Spending + CCP **=** High Margins\*High Productivity\*High Revenues\*Big Brother owned Conglomerate.

Not buying BABA is like not buying into a government owned cash cow.

Another story painted is that in China, Covid has been brought under control much faster than the US. The economy has been reopened with the shortest lockdown cycle than anyone else in the world. In 2017 -2018 US based companies rushed to sell more products to Chinese based consumers because they were spending 15x more than the US did on it's own products. APAC has the greatest sales growth for big brands. That mood has shifted in 2020 and 2021. With supply shortage around the world. Buying local has become the new trend and brands have lost exposure. Especially boycotts to luxury brands.

**Tell me something else:**

&#x200B;

Constraints for putting money somewhere:

High Inflation, High Short Term Yields, Slowed Economy

2023 - Money in bank make more than dividend stonks

Slow economy - lack of funding (no R&D)

**TLDR:**

""I hate the word AI called(used for) artificial intelligence. I call it Alibaba Intelligence.""

"">!Yeah, it might end up being true, you never know!<"" - Elon Musk

&#x200B;

I firmly believe the run up in BABA to 1 trillion will be quick, don't miss it. Buckle up and enjoy the ride.

Low volatility will spike, price movements just \***burst through that ceiling, then you find another one and you bust through that, and just keep hammering at the ceilings.**

Two cities in particular have exploded in growth in the last 30 years, Las Vegas and Phoenix, due to cheap real estate, COL, and a number of other factors yet they are especially vulnerable to environmental changes that will provide opportunities for investors ready to call/put trends. That these two cities saw their housing values fall the farthest in the nation in 08/09 is not an insignificant fact. Neither are sustainable in any sort of measure due to lack of water, rainfall, and now the inability to irrigate in sufficient water from the Colorado river. Farmers and agriculture from Texas to Oregon are for the first time in decades being told to fuck themselves, there are no outs and that they should look for other industries, crops or geographic locations. Electricity shortages have been an issue in CA for decades and are growing worse every year--what will the equivalent of water rolling blackouts, brownouts and shortages for cities, suburbs or developments do for these areas livability, appeal and ability to attract residents?

**Focus on Vegas**
Casinos as we know them in Vegas seem like they would suffer, as they need heads in beds and monkeys at the slots, but they're in the midst of moving online to greatly expand and simplify access for their customers, I think they'll be fine if not far more profitable this way in the long run. Things that seems like they would collapse would be housing prices, locally-focused property management companies and anything dependent on population or growth in the city. What else would you short?

**Focus on Phoenix**
Phoenix has the same water and housing forecast issue in my mind. Interestingly it's squarely in the middle of the next generation economy for electricity, solar and battery manufacturing. This will put upward pressure and support on housing as jobs that require humans to be local in these different areas will be critical to regional and national infrastructure and unlikely to be abandoned, even if they require inefficient solutions, going as far as trucking in water if it came to that.  Still plenty of opportunity to shrink housing from its current state though. What else would you short?

**How to invest and take advantage?**
Neither city will see an immediate exodus, but long-term realities of human water requirements indicate the populations have to shrink.  If you're going to short housing in these areas, what's the corresponding call? Housing in the NW(OR/WA/ID/MT)?  Calls on bottled water Nestle & KO? Texas and CA getting into desalination industry?"

Fun fact. Almost 100% of water used residential and commercial is “reclaimed” meaning the water you shit in and flush hits the sewer system, flows into a treatment facility, gets treated and pumped back out your kitchen sink, over and over and over again.

You implied there were no negatives. I jumped to the easiest example that would not need further explanation in regards to possible land contamination. I could have used the current outcome of they just dump it back into the water, but then I might have to explain the ecological concerns that could occur from raising salinity of the local water when this is done largescale.

2021-06-20 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"EDIT - Editas Theraputics is worth a look I’m holding a ton of shares & options (about $100k total). I’ve invested in EDIT since 2018. EDIT has many patents for CRISPR based gene edit technology and is working on a cure for a form of blindness (EDIT-101) and a cure for sickle cell (EDIT-301). Not familiar with CRISPR? It’s a precise and cheap gene editing platform that is leading to a new whole class of therapeutics. BEAM, CRSP, NTLA are peers. 

EDIT has had missteps and recently got a new CEO who has purchased $1m in shares this year. Rising to nearly $100 earlier this year, EDIT is puttering around in the mid-$30s but a high short interest in shares (18.4%) and near term catalysts expected with a progress report due for EDIT-101 by the end of the year. 

EDIT has partnerships to cure Parkinson’s with BlueRock Therapeutics with additional partnerships with Juno and Allergan."

Don't buy FD's at the open unless you're in and out in a few minutes, they're almost always cheaper in the afternoon.  

OTM FD's should not be in your portfolio after Wednesday, unless you're gonna be in and out in a couple hours at most, or you're a masochist and you like it when the theta gang sticks it in you.  Just take your loss like a man and roll that shit into next week.

I thought, hey maybe there will be other things that make it go up, but all I know is that eventually it should reach a new floor at 160. Since then, I have been pleasantly surprised at the price staying higher. But, I took a margin of safety against my own projections and kept buying until my average was 80, and then said ok it'll at least double. All these other oh this is gonna squeeze plays just seem stupid. If there was a magical short interest % (which is self reported aka lied about) that triggers a squeeze, then nobody would short it past it. Idk, I just feel bad when people go oh this obscure ticker that has no revenue and nobody knows or had ever cared about has x% short interest, it's going to short squeeze any day just seem so lazy and cringe. But, maybe those people deserve to lose their money if they won't even spend 5 minutes researching what they're gambling on."

2021-06-20 03:04:02,wallstreetbets,"It's an option that's priced .01 because it's way out of the money and about to expire. It's basically a lottery ticket if it somehow ends up in the money before expiring, you'll end up with a chance to either sell at a huge gain or exercise it and end up with 100+ shares at a discount price.

Most of the time it expires and you lose whatever you paid.

(If you can afford the cover, don't buy them,  sell them. They're easy money like that.)"

I have never cared much about the specifics of volume to look. Maybe."

2021-06-19 20:33:36,wallstreetbets,"The fuck is this logic. You can make a bet by buying shares, there's just no expiry. If the stock goes down or the company goes bankrupt you still lose all your money. It is still a ""bet"". It's not called WallStreetFDs or WallStreetOptions either."
2021-06-19 21:43:03,wallstreetbets,"Depends on the play. There are plenty of speculative plays where you can do shares. For instance, literally any SPAC. There’s no guarantee it’ll pay off and it could absolutely crash and you be holdin the bag.

Also timeframe. Idk bout you, but I sure as fuck don’t hold for years. Miss out on too many opportunities that way."
2021-06-20 02:11:30,wallstreetbets,"Lol you call  gobbling up GME shares at 15 billion market cap is “investing”?

2021-06-19 23:32:53,wallstreetbets,I sell OTM covered calls. Not a big moneymaker but it's a good supplement. Gotta be careful that you don't get exercised tho (which I did but still made a good chunk of money so happy with it)
2021-06-20 11:25:40,wallstreetbets,"not really asking abt squeeze, just the timing of options execution. I thought everything settled at 4pm Friday"
2021-06-19 22:27:06,wallstreetbets,you're fucking genius why didn't I thought of this
2021-06-19 20:33:23,wallstreetbets,Yeah dude. I know what you mean. I was there. I make 75k last year betting on tech it was good run. But i did not see change in the market sediment. I should’ve stop playing with option so heavily. I loss 85 percent all that money. Only have 10k to my name. Options is a doubleheader sword. You can win big or go homeless. I understand that the game i play.
2021-06-19 20:50:01,wallstreetbets,"\>buying shares

🤢"
2021-06-19 21:28:13,wallstreetbets,"I get exactly what you're saying, but not to contradict you, but I bet your puts were 3 months or more before expiration. They still have tremendous time value (but will still lose a lot of cash quickly on moves from what you paid for them). That's why I pretty much warn the hell out of people not to PM me for advice. I'm a full retard, YOLO, that has blown many accounts. I tried the boring 3 months and out (which you should do as you learn and to be safe), got bored or watched them bleed to my astonishment, and now do no more then 3 weeks. 

Take advice from me on the philosophy of options, but never ask for stock trades. They seem to go the opposite of what I've needed them to go. It's still a rocket ship (I've did great, at times, then gave it right back like I'm in a casino within 2 months of a good gain and trying to go from a retard to sentient much weaker than when I started). But there's no way folks buying extreme OTM puts or calls within 3 weeks of expiration unless you're in a very liquid options market and they're priced under 10 cents. 

I'm glad you got out and accept this like. I would give awards to you if had the cash to do it 🤣🤣. I want everyone to succeed, as only way we bring the MM's to heel and have fairer trading. 

TL;DR Don't play options unless you've paper traded them for at least 6 months and really know what you're doing and how they will be priced on moves..which is nearly impossible when VIX and IV are always on some weaker or stronger scale of what they should be."
2021-06-20 11:31:14,wallstreetbets,Gotcha. You can't buy or sell contracts but you can exercise them. The buyers can execute their contracts over the extended period after the markets close.
2021-06-19 23:58:06,wallstreetbets,"This is not true. You can switch back at anytime right from your settings page. I only know this because I went through the hassle of switching to a cash account when moving everything over to Fidelity. They still transferred as Margin and I had to wait a day for Fidelity to flip them to cash. At any rate, I had enough cash in RH to cover the transfer and then decided to switch it back to the basic margin account just because RH gave me such a runaround switching. No issues, toggled some switches."
2021-06-19 21:55:50,wallstreetbets,"No they expired two weeks after I sold them (yesterday was expiry) 😂 the funny thing is any other stock and puts that far OTM would be worthless, there would be no market for them. Yet I got 1300 a piece on that day (but I literally sold them at the top of the IV spike at 390%."
2021-06-20 11:12:33,wallstreetbets,"Sometimes you can’t sell your contract to anyone, even for $1 (the minimum). 

It’s not true there are always buyers. Nobody has to do anything."
2021-06-20 00:02:49,wallstreetbets,"You were able to switch from cash to margin and back on RH, or Fidelity?"
2021-06-19 22:41:59,wallstreetbets,"🍻🍻🍻 on you. I've never seen anything like that, and I've seen a lot with option playing. May you continue that streak, genuinely. I love to see when folks succeed"
2021-06-20 00:34:24,wallstreetbets,"Switched from margin to cash on RH, transferred everything except fractional shares to Fidelity—they still came over as margin, Fidelity switched them to cash. I then went back to RH and turned back on basic margin without issue, it took two seconds after 5 days of emailing RH back and forth to get it to a cash account—and they still transferred my shares as margin."
2021-06-19 22:44:39,wallstreetbets,"Thanks man, I haven’t been in options that long. But I knew this was a risky, yet unique opportunity. I was looking for a way to profit from the IV but didn’t have shares to sell calls against. So I sold $42 puts when price was in the 60’s."
2021-06-20 00:37:18,wallstreetbets,"Interesting. They make it seem like it’s a permeant thing in the wording, I guess they don’t want people maxing out day trades and bouncing back and fourth"
2021-06-19 22:48:07,wallstreetbets,"Just amazing and I would like to warn people about taking the market price. I ended up with a broker that didn't do Walk Limits, and had a RUT play at .10 to 5.00, my apparatus put it towards the fair price, but when I sent the order, they put a ton of options at 5.00...far beyond any fair price or movement RUT would make to have that position profitable. Horrible day in my life. Never trust wide spreads."

I don't think Elon is the least bit concerned with stock price of Tesla....they'll shit something out before too long that drives it back closer to 4 digits.....if not over. But I could be wrong and they may be insolvent tomorrow.....I have decided that I no longer know anything about anything until further notice. Even then....I'll claim to know less."
2021-06-20 13:54:18,wallstreetbets,"Tesla loves retail investors and they love Tesla. Elon doesn’t like the price this high. He wants a lower priced stock so more people can buy it. I bet he splits it again sometime in the next year. Which will drive a bunch of retail investors to grab it uo. You’ll be fine. 
I first bought TSLA at $75 pre split way back when. My only regret is I didn’t keep buying or I would be retired. Long term Tesla is going to pay off. But what the hell do I know."

to sell a weekly without getting assigned below his cost basis will generate $200/week. unless he goes way out."
2021-06-19 22:32:30,wallstreetbets,"\^This. When i  saw TSLA started dropping i told my friend who has shares to sell cause the $900 or however much it was at the time, is probably the peak we will see on that stock for at least a decade. He is still holding btw and now he has barely made any money and he was up more than 50% at the peak.

Now we cant know for sure, but i find it hard to see how TSLA gets back to that price anytime soon. This is not financial advice and i am retarded."

2021-06-20 19:04:37,wallstreetbets,Agreed. I rode from like $180 (pre-split) up to $670. I set a $600 stop loss and it flash dipped and triggered like 10 minutes later and immediately recovered. It basically shook my into selling when I didn’t want to since it went up another $200 / share after that point… and now back down. Anyway I’m not in so I’d like my sell to be wrinkle brain move.

2021-06-20 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"My wife thinks I’m having an affair with Robin. Any mentions of stonks have been replaced with XX.  Don’t want this to be a propaganda piece just sharing my experience.  

So, I woke up this morning to my wife standing over me holding my phone.  She doesn’t even give me time to  open my eyes and she says “who the hell is Robin!”  I’m tired, haven’t had my morning poo or my Honey Nut Cheerios so of course I’m in no state of mind to understand what she means.  I replied, “I don’t know any Robins”.  She continues yelling at me telling me that I think she’s an idiot, that I’m talking to all of my friends about her and she knew that they were looking at her funny last time we hung out.  So finally she throws the phone at me and says if you don’t want to be honest fine, I’ll just leave.  So I’m up enough to read at this point, and when I look at my phone I had texted my buddy Ray, “I’m gonna get all up in Robin Hood Monday morning, I’m a horny bull for some XX and don’t worry I’m gonna XXXX off before I get home to my wife.”  That was one of my more PG texts - as I’m sure my fellow apes can understand that I go hard on something when I believe it can make me that money (XX) - and when I believe in the company (XXXX).  Anyways, 2 hours of convincing later I’m still married.  However she now knows where all of our money is going - down the big fat drain.  Not sure if I’ll get upvotes or down votes for that last part.  Happy weekend retards, if anyone has some good loss porn please post it, I think I’ll be on the couch for a few days."

2021-06-20 13:41:34,wallstreetbets,I think being on Robinhood is worse than having an affair with a woman named Robin.

I started explains a stock chart to my mom the other day. She just stared at me with a frustrated look on her face.

2021-06-19 21:58:10,wallstreetbets,Honestly... financial transparency is an impotrant part of a relationship.  If you aren't being transparent with what you are doing ... that is a form of cheating.
2021-06-19 22:21:54,wallstreetbets,Your wife is smarter than you.

2021-06-19 23:48:50,wallstreetbets,"The Robinhood hatred is TIRED because it turns into berating the people that post. I used TDA, not RH…. But still it’s crazy how many times somebody posts and they end up getting made fun of for using Robinhood. How about y’all back off and stfu"
2021-06-19 23:57:31,wallstreetbets,WSB/DFV murdered Robinhood’s IPO. Good job boys

2021-06-19 23:34:27,wallstreetbets,Bro no one lies on the internet I don't know what you're even taking about.
2021-06-20 03:00:15,wallstreetbets,"Agree with this entirely. With how RH has been in the news it would be hard to miss that. 

Not only that he'd have to completely keep his losses and deposits secret, which would mean she has no access to bank accounts. Not super likely today, maybe 50 years ago, but today everyone has access to that stuff without much effort. I mean maybe he has a side account, but even then that would have been discussed in a healthy marriage. 

He says now she knows where the money is going... Bullshit! No way my wife wouldn't notice if a penny was out of order and he's talking like much larger losses are occurring."
2021-06-19 23:08:03,wallstreetbets,One of the best reasons to leave Robin is to commit to in-Fidelity.
2021-06-19 20:12:47,wallstreetbets,Why was this comment auto-hidden? It was in the middle of the replies. What's going on?

2021-06-20 00:01:40,wallstreetbets,"Here's my best attempt at ELI5:

The working class (retail investors) went to war against  hedge funds when some hedge funds over shorted GME. Citadel was one of those hedge funds who happened to short GME. They were going to be squeezed to the moon (pay lots of money) on 1/28/21. But on that day, Robinhood prevented users from buying GME and only allowed the sell option. 
This reversed the moon squeeze and allowed hedge funds to exit/sell their losses. Citadel happened to be a major investor of Robinhood. Robinhood screwed retail investors by freezing GME trading on 1/28/21. *Innocent until proven guilty. 
So regardless of outcome, they betrayed the retail investors to protect the hedge funds. 

Lastly, Robinhood data is shared with Citadel."

2021-06-20 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Drunk man's DD of SPCE Im deep in the whiskey, I’ve already pissed myself, and I wanna talk about Vaginal Galactic

Do you want to be the Chad of Wall Street? Are you tired of hearing being called a little bitch? Are you sad, drunk, and alone covered in piss thinking about how existence is an illusion? Invest in SPCE 

**The company** (not sure I really need to lay this out but whatever)

SPCE aims to be the worlds first “commercial spaceline and vertically integrated aerospace company”. 

Wut da hell does that actually mean?

Short term, SPCE hope will basically act as a glorified rollercoaster for rich people to go into space and occasionally some scientist to conduct experiments. Over time they quite literally aim to be the taxi cab of space flight whether its transcontinental or a trip to an orbiting hotel/ laboratory. While yeah, we’re a fucking long way off from orbiting hotels, but this has already caught they eye of private research agencies whom might not have the capability to just go up in space. Ole daddy Branson is a visionary who is years beyond all the competition and is laying a foundation for what will inevitably become a lucrative business. While Space-x, Blue Balls Bezos, and every other rocket producing agency are focused on just that, producing rockets like fucking losers, SPCE is producing a taxi service for the cosmos (inserts picture of VSauce kissing daddy Tyson)

**The Financials** 

These aren’t great so lets get it out of the way. 

\- R&D expenses increased 19% YoY, good for growth

\- In 2020 their revenues decreased 93.7%, the lost some government contracts

\- Cash $665.9M’s to help cover their poor revenue 

**The Game Plan**

\- Glorified taxi for scientist, rich people, and instruments

\- Expansion of their proprietary and reusable rockets/ planes, which are much cheaper to fly BTW

\- Increasing their R&D and expanding government/ private contracts

**The Team**

\- Former NASA Chief of Staff and Chris Hadfield, this is all you need to know

**Risk**

\- Very poor financial performance (I believe that we are investing at the ground level and are investing into an idea/     vision rather than the current performance of the company)

\- They have two more test flights and anymore failures will significantly slow progress and cause the share price to      commit Seppuku

\- Their very secretive with launch dates and PR team is garbage

**Upcoming Catalyst**

\- Upcoming FAA approval, pending 2 more test flights (both of which are planned in the coming months and after each successful flight the share price also launches into space

\- Richard Branson plans on going on 1 of 2 upcoming test flights (he was gonna do this before bitch boi Bezos said he was)

All in all, I believe that an investment in SPCE is buying into an idea rather than the company's current endeavors. This company is laying down a foundation for what will inevitably become a necessity for future travel. I believe SPCE is very forward thinking and that’s why I throw money at them. I am very drunk, been watching Billions, and legitimately I do not know what I’m talking about. I’m going to go throw up now, later losers.

&#x200B;

The market downturn will be a blip this year, volatility was expected. Sell low if you want to lose.

&#x200B;

CRSR, a premium American games hardware company, is one of the most undervalued plays that you’ve ever seen in a long time in the public markets. IPOed Sept. 23 at $17 a share and is almost double that! Fair value is 73% away from the current price! Analysts agree that the stock price is lower than it should be. Consistently, it has paid down its debt and increased revenue. This come August earnings, it will be the same story: Higher revenue and lowered debt. Hell, the market cap multiplier is below its competitors which is very odd. It is a catch now.

&#x200B;

I haven’t seen anyone said they hate Corsair’s products or tramp on their quality. You know what? New products are coming especially with DDR5 busting out the gates. Dominator and Vengeance Memory modules are insanely profitable for Corsair! With Dominator and Vengeance DDR5 rocketing performance by 2x, you fucking bet nerds, gamers and enthusiasts are going to the bat for Corsair Memory! DDR5-6400 folks, 51 G/Bs Bandwidth is 2x more than the last generation. It is insane! Check out the [PCGamer article](https://www.pcgamer.com/corsair-ddr5-primer-dominator-1tb-ram/) where Corsair says ""More bandwidth allows for more efficient use of the memory bus in systems with high core count CPUs while the denser capacities will allow your system to tackle even more at once which is great for streaming and content creation (just to name a few applications).”

&#x200B;

Who’s in the streaming business? You know it, CORSAIR! The higher the performance, the better the streaming! Corsair owns Elgato, which sells the whole streaming bundle getting content creators focused on providing the best content in the best environment without worrying about quality. Corsair is very serious about streaming after COVID. “80% of Corsair’s revenue comes from competitive gamers” according to a Seeking Alpha Article “Corsair Gaming: The Overlooked Winner Of The Gaming Boom.“ Esports and Twitch are not going away and are expected to keep growing. The 5G market continue to grow with telecoms expanding availability and phone manufacturers finally jumping on the 5G bandwagon. These are catalysts for the streaming market. The live streaming market is expected to grow globally by a Compound annual growth rate (CAGR) by 19% during 2019 - 2025 according to Kenneth Research [link](https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/live-game-streaming-market-share-2021-size-share-future-trends-opportunities-industry-expansion-strategies-and-global-analysis-by-forecast-to-2024-says-kenneth-research-2021-03-24). Soon, you will be able to go anywhere in the world and keep up with your favorite live streamer personality.

&#x200B;

It is easy to blame WallStreetBets for the recent price spike, but we all have the same goal! Apes took a shot and an insider coincidentally sold a bunch of shares and it would have happened without WSB. You shot your shot and are depressed as much as the stock has been. Don’t worry though, you reward is coming and all you have to do is believe in CRSR. More spikes are incoming for the short term because it has WSB attention, but we will stabilize and grow for the long term.

&#x200B;

I am bullish for the short term and bullish on the long term. Corsair is widely agreed to be high quality and undervalued. You absolutely need this in your portfolio. FOMO if you want though!

&#x200B;

Hold for the long term, you will be severely rewarded. The play of a lifetime!

Huge handicap if you can't assess a stock or the market by yourself and rely on others.

Still, back then it was genuinely about getting an edge over hedge funds. Now that's what people say as they ask what a yearly is? Sure it's cute but I'm not welcome to enterntaining it on this sub the way you are. Especially something like that which is quicker for them to google than for me to explain. These people have years to go before they catch up to hedge funds, and serve as a huge anchor weighing down the rest of the sub who knew their shit and was steady refining it before all these casuals showed up. There are other subs better suited for them. WSB was always the place where you either know your shit or GTFO, and I miss it."
2021-06-19 22:20:25,wallstreetbets,38.7%. Closer to 50% than your shitty 20% undermine. Show me a stock that moves 38.7% out of nowhere brought on by absolutely nothing. Oh and then it crashes immediately back to where it started. It's a pump and dump stop fucking denying it.
2021-06-19 22:51:16,wallstreetbets,How so?

2021-06-20 07:08:31,wallstreetbets,"quite the pump and dump, wsb pumps, eagletree dumps.

im still holding though"
2021-06-19 22:18:12,wallstreetbets,I agree and that's why I see room for competitors even if they are fringe and have a small market share. But I don't know shit
2021-06-20 10:56:39,wallstreetbets,Bots are definite things around here. I've witnessed them with my own two eyes. Accounts made literally 5 minutes before posting and spamming tickers. What happened to CRSR feels like a more coordinated effort to obfuscate the method but the results have never been more blatant. I hope if you have 100+ shares you can at least write some covered calls and claw back some of that cost basis.
2021-06-20 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Kick back with Uncle $SAM this 4th of July and America guarantees tendies by EOY TLDR- Alcohol never goes down. Stock market goes up? You drink in celebration of your obvious genius. Stock market goes down? You drink lamenting that you just ""timed it wrong"". This makes investing in alcohol a (no pun intended) no-brainer.

As an introduction, $SAM owns Samuel Adams (Beer \[ticker matches the product, I know some of you care about that\]), Truly Hard Seltzer (Hard Seltzer will be the highlight of the ensuing paragraphs EDIT: eventually, kind of), Twisted Tea (yes they still make that), Angry Orchard (Cider), and Dogfish Head (IPA). On top of all this, they recently announced the establishment of an R&D hub in Canada led by the former Director of Innovation at Canopy Growth (yeah, weeds too). They have alllllll the bases covered.

$SAM has bottle-rocketed through the stratosphere the past 18 months. It's lowest point the week of January 6th 2020 it closed at $367.95 and reached an ATH of $1,349.98 two months prior to this post. It straight up laughed in the face of the pandemic, hitting $306.46 on March 16th 2020 (this represents a 16.71% decrease between the week of January 6th 2020 and March 16th 2020, meanwhile, SPY went down 29.75% between the week of January 6th 2020 and the week of March 16th 2020) and climbing to $522.33 by June 1st 2020 ($SAM went up by 70.44% while SPY went up 39.57% in the same time period).

Not enough numbers? Don't worry, I have some more (idiots welcome to yawn through this one):

Consensus estimate for earnings (yes, like actual dollars and cents, not like most of the stuff that gets posted here) for Q1 2021 was $2.61EPS. The correct answer for Q1 2021 was $5.26EPS

Hit a bit recently because a single analyst dropped them from ""buy"" (very good) to neutral (if you bought, there is for sure still hope), as well as our favorite Jimbo Creamer recommending folks sell a few days back. The current analyst estimates (there are 15 covering the stock) on average rate $SAM a buy, with a high target of **$1,800** and only one analyst thinking it will go below $1,000 (I know, I also despise Mormons). Recently glazed and held slightly above ""oversold"" on the one-year RSI the past few days.

The most recent Nielsen scanner data documents gains for $SAM in the hard seltzer category reaching >30% market share in the last two weeks, primarily due to the launch of Truly Punch, which reached an impressive \~7.0% market share of hard seltzer, well ahead of competitive launches and achieved within a few months of being distributed.

Side Note- buy a Truly Punch. Drink it. Remark how it tastes OK. Maybe drink another one. I mean heck, it's Summer, drink another one after that. Wake up behind a Wendy's dumpster. Grab a six pack of Truly's. Rinse and repeat.

Think about it- this isn't pieces of metal being pushed down hillsides, promises of clean graphite by 2029, or the company's CEO doing too much coke one night and YOLOing on Coirn. This is YOU buying ALCOHOL, which, while I'm confident some of you don't- quality of content on this sub suggests most of you are nursing a severe hangover right now.

My Personal Opinion Of A Play: Q2 FY21 EPS expected to be announced July 22nd, 2021. August or September calls likely to go BRRRR. I went September because it's gonna be HOT until October and I am going to drink a Turly as soon as I hit the post button.

My meager positions:

1 SAM $1,540 9/17 Call

1 SAM $1,320 9/17 Call"
2021-06-20 02:08:15,wallstreetbets,"I think the argument here is around a shift in spending, not an overall growth in the amount of alcohol consumed. (Though this will probably trend upwards through the summer and holidays, as people continue to revenge travel. And god knows we’ll all be getting hammered with Uncle Buck this coming holiday season.)

The seltzer growth is still happening, albeit slower than the initial rocket ship. I see growth here as the type of alcohol consumed continues to evolve."

2021-06-20 15:54:09,wallstreetbets,"I'm trying to learn from what will likely be a BB failure for me (BB calls expiring July 2)

Why is it that the stock seems to take a beating when good news is being announced for it? I was so excited as these being 2 of my first ever calls, and was really expecting it to be around $17 a share by now, but it totally went the other way. what is the best lesson I can learn from this, and what lessons have y'all learned from calls you lost money on?

Thanks in advance."
2021-06-19 21:37:41,wallstreetbets,"Yea. BB has been a dud. I'm sure many of us here bought BB, GME, AMC in January-February 2021. But hey, only a couple months until lower capital gains taxes. 


I'm going to keep holding my BB for about a year, and then reevaluate."
2021-06-19 23:59:22,wallstreetbets,"Last ER would have gone much better for BB had the patent sales been included. Chen has all but said they'll be included in this one.

2021-06-20 05:21:59,wallstreetbets,"So im out of the loop with BB, a lot of the hype is around AMC due to the stock being shorted/naked shares/ gamma squeeze etc etc. So is BB in the same boat? is it being shorted? im wondering if its worth grabbing some BB right now, is it what AMC was 4 monthes ago? Basically im not sure why the other meme stocks don't have the same hype."
2021-06-20 09:16:11,wallstreetbets,I HATE the stock

2021-06-19 22:50:27,wallstreetbets,"Nothing is lol, that’s the point of my comment"
2021-06-20 10:55:44,wallstreetbets,Selling for profits.
2021-06-19 23:18:34,wallstreetbets,"You're buying the right to sell your shares to the writer of the put for the strike price. Generally speaking a bearish position.

For example I bought bought a 13 put and it expired ITM and I meant to sell it. Unfortunately, I paid about 30 bucks for it and the price of BB is at 12.84 which means I need to buy the stock I didn't own for 1284 and get paid 1300 for net 16 bucks... minus out the thirty and I lost 14 dollars plus a couple bucks in commission and fees.

Since it was a naked put and exercised for me I am short 100 shares of BB. Which means I need to buy some in morning hours. I hope the price falls so I am closer to breakeven. If it rises to 13ish I need to buy them back just to avoid a maintenance call before open. My other positions aren't ready to be sold and I'd take a huge loss.


It ain't all roses. 😅"
2021-06-20 01:03:11,wallstreetbets,"buying a $14 put exp. 6/26 means  you think itll stay below 14, if it goes lower, you get paid morer"
2021-06-20 13:28:32,wallstreetbets,Yes and will be the same people crying when BB hits 60 saying “I can’t believe I sold B be at 1X woe is me.” 😩
2021-06-20 13:59:16,wallstreetbets,Huge difference thought because BB won't be hitting 60 haha
2021-06-20 18:33:39,wallstreetbets,Just wait.
2021-06-20 09:52:48,wallstreetbets,"Nothing wrong with shares. Earnings call next week could go either way, but I'm leaning towards a good result. With all the new bagholders, it might cause a spike in price and interest again, which would be sustainable. Then again, it might take another quarter in the positive for it to fully take off after the last two test flights."
2021-06-20 06:07:18,wallstreetbets,"I don’t know, but I have about 1.5 million invested in BB and will continue to add this week. 

Most of the people assuring you that BB is going down are know-nothings."

2021-06-20 01:11:57,wallstreetbets,yeah so buy puts and then put profits into the cheap shares after lol

2021-06-20 06:02:11,wallstreetbets,"You do not know that. There’s also a world where they show growth in cyber security sales and the stock explodes upwards. Expectations including yours, are low."
2021-06-20 13:27:26,wallstreetbets,"I don’t really know precisely. I have been building the position since November.  45,000 shares have a cost basis of under eight dollars the 30,000 shares have a cost basis probably have like 17 or 18, But I sold 5000 shares this week to buy more leaps. The leapS average out to about 5 dollars."
2021-06-20 06:04:59,wallstreetbets,"Hahaha. Theres a lot of confident know-nothings here who are pretty sure bb is going low again. I suspect most of them have $3000 in their account and have been trading for less than a year….
There is plenty of reason to believe that even if Q2 is weak that expectations are so low, and the optimism around Q3 anf forward will support the stock no matter what happens, absent genuinely bad news."

2021-06-20 05:39:00,wallstreetbets,I couldn't agree more. The Cramer Effect is widely used. Whatever Cramer says. Do the opposite. Works 85% of the time. That's a very tradable percentage!
2021-06-20 09:13:32,wallstreetbets,Anybody that does a show like that hits a point where they become full of shit. Eventually everyone runs out of content and just covers any subject for the sake of filling their time. Integrity gets left behind after episode 160.
2021-06-20 09:23:35,wallstreetbets,"He has a fucking TV show. He needs ratings. He doesn’t give a shit if you like him or not, he just cares if he’s relevant enough to get viewers. You take TV personalities way too seriously."

2021-06-20 03:48:40,wallstreetbets,Oh no death threats in the internet. play one round of any moba of your choice and you get 10 death threats per hour. who the fuck cares about that. people who are actually a threat to your life are not going to announce it on the internet.

2021-06-19 20:30:37,wallstreetbets,"Yep. Look: Another post about Cramer on the front page of reddit. 

Exposure is the thing Cramer and all shills in the entire world want. For example, every subreddit dedicated to hating on someone helps that person get so much more famous.

This post falls perfectly into his trap."

Any stock can dip and most do and at any point of the prices previous to or after the dip doesn't mean it was a pump and dump;

""denoting the fraudulent practice of encouraginginvestors to buy shares in a company in order to inflate the priceartificially, and then selling one's own shares while the price is high.""

&#x200B;

I would like to know which source you think pumped this stock.

&#x200B;

What most likely happened is bag holder from when it was in the 40's and high 30's took a profit and or exited out at a level they felt satisfied not losing too much money because they didn't want to wait.

That and day traders doing their thing.

There's no saving this sub anymore, it's been overrun by the ape mentality. It's been fun while it lasted, I just wish I found this place a couple years earlier.

2021-06-19 23:01:27,wallstreetbets,"I've been (mostly lurking) here since the days when JNUG Yolos were a thing and the term FD was coined.  This place was awesome until TSLA went up like 500% in 6 months.  That's pretty much when it stopped being fun.  There's been little variety since then.  The top 25 posts of the day have the same 1-2 tickers in them.  Posts are often just reposted from 5 other subs farming karma.  There's fighting in the comments instead of playful banter.  This sub is unbearable now.

Imo the essence of this sub originally was it's existence despite the rest of reddit.  Reddit became Facebook, yet WSB stayed an anomaly.  It was a true diamond in the rough.  Now it's exactly the same as the rest of reddit.  Yuck."

Sure them not answering me when I asked about the removal of the post made me a bit dubious about that. But seeing how the mod team is coming up with bots to help them stop this and this list of rules being pinned... they certainly started trying a lot harder since I posted it. Please give them a break."
2021-06-20 05:46:00,wallstreetbets,"You can post about any stock you want as long as they aren’t spacs, small caps or digital money (the shit you can ACTUALLY manipulate) and those rules have been in place or evolved for as long as I remember and well before your 2.5month old account has been here. 

I agree that we see a lot of posts around a few specific tickers but it’s a public forum and some shits more popular at times - last year you could’ve made the same point about the Tesla fanboys but granted it wasn’t to this extent being a smaller sub then. 

If you think someone’s spewing shit to pnd something then report it or tag a mod. I always report the “(random ticker) to $1M/share” comments as breaking the “no bullshitting” rule. 

Suggest things they could do better to clean it up. For example, I suggest every ape post can only be posted if they answer one of u/memetron9000 ‘s math questions - then when they get it wrong its problem solved (pun maybe intended). 

To just conclude the people running it are making profit off it is such a baseless leap"
2021-06-20 04:50:37,wallstreetbets,I don’t think it matters when they put it up if they will leave it pinned for a couple of days.
2021-06-20 05:53:00,wallstreetbets,They’re easy PnD targets
2021-06-20 04:52:12,wallstreetbets,The sub has 10 million followers give or take. It’s extremely easy with that following to PnD a stock. Just gotta make the DD sound quite reasonable and thousands of degenerates will buy 10k worth of stocks and that makes it skyrocket. It’s a precautionary measure just as not allowing SPACs.

2021-06-20 09:16:05,wallstreetbets,"The more I explore Reddit the more I realize it’s just another tool for social conditioning of the masses.  When 8+ million “investors” are following the sub you don’t think what is posted here influences them?  I’m not talking about outside groups running up stocks, I’m saying that from my perspective it looks like posts are selectively allowed/removed by the mods to influence actions that are profitable for their own positions.

2021-06-19 20:34:03,wallstreetbets,I know your busy. But can you adjust rules for CEOs of company who come on these forums?
2021-06-20 05:01:41,wallstreetbets,"As a mod of other boards on the webz there have often been times when we have had to make posts that would be ""controversial"" at best, and board melting at worst. We've usually discussed optimal timing  for those types of posts to be made.

If it were me, taking this post and posting it during a slow time and pinning it for several days gives it more of a sense of permanence before it gets really busy.

Personally, I would leave it pinned for way longer than a few days. It's relevant information, and will take time before you reach a good percentage of member views."

2021-06-20 13:37:11,wallstreetbets,"Most SPACs are not doing well. Even the ones that are doing well have low volume. Institutions stopped pitching them to clients and they got banned here. So the only entities trading them are arbitrage funds and a handful of retail traders. I dont need a pump, just volume like I said in my comment."

I happened to see your comment and felt I should reply, then you responded. That's pretty much all there is to it. I reply to lots of random comments around here, when I feel there's some sort of conversation to be had."
2021-06-20 11:32:10,wallstreetbets,"The paragraph intro thats normally the first part you see of a post in the feed, went something like: “sold my amc and GME at the high last week  and rolled into WKSP.  They make hard top truck bed covers and their new product line has solar panels built in that can increase the range of electric trucks by up to %30.”  It read something like that,  also included the “I am not a financial advisor and I eat crayons” bs and what not after the paragraph you just saw."

2021-06-19 20:27:00,wallstreetbets,"Of all the ""meme"" stonks, this one has the most natural growth potential, from what I've read. Health and health insurance has shown more growth than US big tech, which is crazy! And this is an industry disruptor in that they use AI. 

On top of all that, 99% of the float is short!! The price has hugely suppressed. You've read all that DD already.

But it's still very popular and many people think it's a good play. Either way, best of luck!! 👍"
2021-06-19 20:38:15,wallstreetbets,AND - CLOV is not a regular meme stock - BUY SHARES
2021-06-19 21:38:49,wallstreetbets,"United Health market cap is 370bln. If Clover can take 25% of that market share which it’s doing in their established markets, then theoretically Clover would be a 90bln company ~> $200+ per share."
2021-06-19 20:37:33,wallstreetbets,"I’m holding my shares (25000+) averaging up a little by little lately (hoping that it contributes to volume/price), but plan is is to become CLOV multimillionaire squeeze or no squeeze, and this is when I sell."
2021-06-19 20:56:31,wallstreetbets,2 months seems like enough time for the OP on CLOV
2021-06-19 21:19:50,wallstreetbets,My plan is to continue buying. I’m positive it’s a great move. Shorts may start covering on Monday so I’d buy at open if I were you.
2021-06-20 01:09:15,wallstreetbets,CLOV 🍀🍀🍀🚀🚀🚀
2021-06-20 03:26:21,wallstreetbets,I just bought more at $12.03 on Friday
2021-06-20 00:47:33,wallstreetbets,"Did you see some of the crap BofA gave for the downgrade? Analyst expectations show CLOV growth outpacing the industry but BofA wants to put a leash on how much the stock should climb even... hmm I wonder why. They’re also bashing CLOV for lowering their guidance in 2020 when everyone and their mother did the same that year. If it looks, smells and tastes like BS, then it’s BS."
2021-06-20 01:25:53,wallstreetbets,Im actually just gonna hold. When looking at the available info CLOV is not a bad play. Even fundamentals say it could be $20 a share. Its grown its rev 45% YoY. The short report has never been confirmed. It seems likely Hindenburg threw out the accusation knowing even if they are cleared DoJ and SEC investigations take on average 2.5 years to complete. Biden most likely will include beneficial funding for healthcare/medicare during his term. The short interest is incredibly high at 48%. They also have earnings on 8/2 which may be positive.
2021-06-20 01:34:03,wallstreetbets,I hold CLOV and AMC.  No plans to sell either.  Both will squeeze
2021-06-20 02:00:20,wallstreetbets,Roll it to either shares or warrants so you stop bleeding as badly but I think the next couple of weeks will be interesting

You're just looking at overall stock value."
2021-06-20 15:35:48,wallstreetbets,"I also made money on CLOV, and don't have a position in it anymore.

My comment isn't really for you to be honest. It was to help people who are starting to realize that they are getting fucking scammed on this sub see something that reflects that gut feeling.

I'm just trying to help these people who keep buying into pump and dumps and end up holding the bag for months, while the people who propped them up get out with a profit quick.  


If CLOV truly always was a long term prudent investment choice for you, great. You're not my target audience."
2021-06-20 02:52:00,wallstreetbets,"I think y’all both right lmao, let’s all get along 🤣 

Relative vs Absolute are both necessary to bring up. However, both values are kinda funny.

Your provided percentages are .0033 vs .0014 and his provided cash is 6mil vs 43m

Getting back to the crux, the DD/verdict on Citadel is…

They don’t have a massive effect on share price in either company.

Clover’s CEO Vivek owns like 20% of the company, and Chamath owns like 10m shares, which could be concerning if the whole “30 days over $30” requirement to sell shares isn’t true. I know Clover has a 6 month lockup expiry after going public, but I haven’t had time to read Clover’s S1 to see which shares are under lockup rules and which are under the 30 over $30 rules.

Anyhow, enjoy the weekend! Can’t wait for Monday!"

Little high, little low,
Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to
Me, to me
Mamaaa,
Just killed a man,
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger,
Now he's dead
Mamaaa, life had just begun,
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, oooh,
Didn't mean to make you cry,
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow,
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters
Too late, my time has come,
Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all
The time
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go,
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, oooh
I don't want to die,
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all.

So you think you can love me and leave me to die

2021-06-20 00:56:00,wallstreetbets,It’s the funny part is that the stocks are real. They are more real than the money. Stocks are actually ownership shares of a company. Money is just something the government prints and says you have to accept it and represents ownership of nothing real since the gold standard was abandoned.

I’m just gonna let you soak in your shit with your negative downvotes.
2021-06-19 21:13:09,wallstreetbets,"Nice way to avoid everything else. Didnt say wsb was a place for smart investors, and I called you dumb about what you said with FDs. I’m just pointing out how you’re blatantly lying trying to lure in other dumb kids like yourself with misinformation to help your pump n dump. No hard to tell you started investing after the meme craze, or options trading at least. Buying FDs on earnings week for non meme stocks is already a dumb idea, for meme stocks it’s just throwing money away. It’s like betting 10k to win at most $100. Expect the chances of losing are 99-1. Upside is pretty limited unless they absolutely crush er. The FD gains you probably see that are 20x+ are from IV spikes.

And the only downvotes are coming from the other bb bagholders who have to face reality that they’re either gonna have to wait a yr+ to recover their principal if you believe in the fundamentals/expectations or hope for another pump n dump"
2021-06-19 22:04:08,wallstreetbets,You literally are in another reality bro. I specifically said that options on earnings would be an ignorant and risky position. Shut the fuck up you lazy low IW ape lol. Literally NO ONE is saying anyone should buy this to pump it besides the idiots who pump every other stock just as AMC or Gme or anything that has no real future. At least BB does but you attack it with conjecture and false confirmation bias. You are an actual hack job
2021-06-19 22:07:00,wallstreetbets,"No, you said there was an allure to FDs and 0dte’s. As if it was a good play that many people are thinking about. It wouldn’t even pay well, even if BB went up 5-7ish%, hell even 10% post earnings which already has a low chance of happening. Maybe read and learn a lil before you write some bs wall of text"
2021-06-19 22:09:42,wallstreetbets,YES there’s an allure to the retards in WSB for risky ignorant plays. How hard is that to understand?? You’re trying to make sense of actual amateur armchair investors who just throw money around basically randomly
2021-06-19 22:11:28,wallstreetbets,"The whole point of RISKY plays is to make BIG returns. Are you really that retarded to see how playing against an IV crush is NOT worth the risk as it does NOT pay well even if the price goes up?

2021-06-20 15:58:34,wallstreetbets,"Let me preface this by saying I am part of the $BB bull gang here and while I haven't been posting actively, I own shares and have a good portion of money in long OTM calls on $BB.  The article you are referencing is not fake news.  The second part of your DD essentially backs that up.  Hypervisor is a completely different animal from the QNX Neutrino operating system that was being used on the Sync system.

As you already explained, Hypervisor allows for safety critical features to be run on the same SoC as non-safety critical components.  So for example, you can have your digital cluster software running on the same hardware as your infotainment system, however, if the infotainment system were to lock-up or reset, the cluster will continue working uninterrupted.  Essentially, this allows OEMs to save money on hardware because they can start to combine ECUs.  

Now, the article says that Ford is looking to drop QNX and switch to Android - this part is true. This is the case with most OEMs as Android has a ton of advantages. For example, Android has an established eco system with a storefront that can be tailored for the automotive industry, QNX does not.  App developers can make things like navigation apps and media apps which can be adapted for the automotive space with little rework. Licensing costs are also a big factor here.  OEMs are actually approaching infotainment suppliers and specifically listing Android as one of the major requirements for their next-gen systems.  Suppliers are showcasing Hypervisor as a potential solution for driving multiple ECUs (cluster and infotainment mainly) on a single SoC such as the ones developed by Qualcomm or MediaTek.

So to summarize, $BB to the moon, BUT your post is calling something fake news when in fact it is not.

Source: I have been working for one of the largest infotainment suppliers for the last 10+ years and have been working on next gen proof of concept projects."

2021-06-20 17:21:11,wallstreetbets,"What they reported is exactly what is happening for the Ford Sync system. They are dropping QNX and switching to Android based infotainment.  It's far from a hit job. You can throw out as many exclamation points as you want, but the fact of the matter is the report is accurate. You're referencing Hypervisor which is essentially a different product.  Hypervisor is a virtualization technology to run multiple OS's on a single chip.  The INFOTAINMENT - which Ford brands as Sync - is going to be running on Android.

Rather than throwing stupid accusations maybe try doing some research. License costs for QNX are the same, but why would a company double up on the cost for the QNX OS + Hypervisor when they can use Android OS for the infotainment part of their digital cockpit solution?"

2021-06-20 10:33:13,wallstreetbets,"Hi,  I'm Chad Dickens,  and here's a response for you. 

You need electronic control for a lot of stuff,  and I mean A LOT. For example,  modern cars use injectors to deliver fuel to the cylinder via direct or port injection.  This is moderated and controlled through feedback from a cars oxygen sensors. Why do we do this? Well it can significantly increase throttle response,  it can help with fuel economy, it can reduce harmful emissions (if done correctly), and  it can increase the reliability and smoothness of the vehicle.  Oh, and you know how sometimes old cars won't start when it's cold outside,  well fuel injection tends to help with that.

Then you have things like cam phasing, variable intake geometry, and cylinder deactivation, all of which provide varying benefits like increased throttle response, fuel mileage, improved power bands,  and smoother operation. Keep in mind these technologies have been around since the 90s and 00s. As for transmissions, I know much less about them specifically,  but mechanically controlling modern 8+ gear transmissions definitely sounds like it would be a full fledged slush box. I doubt the response would be great without having crazy high pressures in it. 

For everything else it goes back to safety. ABS needs a computer to read wheel speed sensors and find which tires are slipping. Same goes for traction control, electronic stability,  and any of the brand new stuff like lane keep assist need computer functionality. 

Also everything in the car needs some kind of microcontroller right down to your climate control. I know even my 2003 dodge ram has a cheap pcb with some stuff on it for its hvac panel. Need something for radios and if you want your Windows to have fancy functionality that needs a controller. Remote locking doors have some circuitry to code and decode a signal between the key fob and the car. And your modem infotainment, well that's obvious.

Believe it or not, up until very recently it would have been pretty easy to go to an older style electrical control for a lot of things,  but the reality is that pcbs with simple semiconductor chips and microcontrollers were (at least before this shortage) an order of magnitude cheaper. Also,  now car companies are utilizing these new controls so well that building without them would feel like putting a 2010 car interior into a 1998 vehicle. Not to mention it would probably violate so many safety and emissions laws to do so."
2021-06-19 22:11:05,wallstreetbets,Still trying to figure out how RIDE is on schedule to produce cars by September when the big 3 have chip problems and getting cars on dealer lots. Went by a Toyota dealer lot to service my 2020 and the place is half empty. Wondering now how the used 2020 market is going. I heard used cars or at a premium.
2021-06-20 17:53:24,wallstreetbets,Because when they use qnx for infotainment the development of the entire interface and lifecycle mgmt is up to Ford! That’s costly!!! With moving to android they don’t have to manage the interface! Yes qnx hypervisor cost more but it’s still cheaper than managing the interface in house . Blackbrrry makes more money by Ford switching to qnx hypervisor and Ford saves money by handing over development of the user interface!!! But it loses the control of the user interface by giving it to android.

2021-06-19 20:25:51,wallstreetbets,"This secret Ford meeting is inaccurate. Ford dealers have been aware for months that Ford was building incomplete vehicles - those vehicles are now starting to ship. There are not going to be leftover 2020 vehicles -
The chip shortage didn’t impact anything until the 21 model year was underway. And Ford is already transitioning to 22 model year on some lines - which they don’t fully do until all of the 21 models have been finished and shipped. 

Yes - there is a chip shortage impacting production. But everything else you wrote is inaccurate."
2021-06-20 18:15:11,wallstreetbets,"This post is incredibly incoherent. I know for a fact that Ford relied on a supplier to develop the core system along with any interfaces they need for future development. They then developed on top of that core system in-house.

QNX Hypervisor has nothing to do with this article.  I do not know how else to explain that. The article clearly states that Ford is switching to Android for their infotainment solution.  Blackberry may be making money off of Hypervisor licensing, but they are also losing money as Ford is no longer using them for their infotainment solution.

[last 5 days](https://i.imgur.com/tFYLhm9.jpg)

[last 30 days](https://i.imgur.com/Vs27x3x.jpg)

Or are you just confusing WISH green for all the negative momentum and red day losses of [insert your favorite played-out bagholder meme stock here]. 

[But don’t take my word for it](https://i.imgur.com/htuPfg6.jpg)"
2021-06-19 20:53:31,wallstreetbets,"Shouldn’t the OP just sold before the expiration? Above 12.5? It was at 13, no?

Full disclosure- I don’t know shit about options or contracts, calls![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|dizzy_face)![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|table)![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|table_flip)"
2021-06-19 21:33:50,wallstreetbets,While that sounds funny it isn't true... Watch the Judge Judy episode on WISH my mom was telling me about it..
2021-06-19 23:43:10,wallstreetbets,Yea I don’t think snorting coke and fucking bitches really go together like people make it seem I’ve heard from a lot of real coke users that they dick can’t get hard when they on coke so all those Wall Street movies lied to u kid
2021-06-19 22:54:36,wallstreetbets,"You're talking about investment strategies on WSB as if that shit belongs here.  We don't invest, we trade, and whether or not Wish is a good trade right now has absolutely nothing to do with whether they're a good 5 or 10 year investment."
2021-06-20 06:41:28,wallstreetbets,"They think there are enough Etsy resellers to drive revenue I guess.

My point is I think only 16 year old girls use wish."
2021-06-19 22:35:33,wallstreetbets,"Institutional holds 99.49% of BBBY shares.  
So SI doesn’t even remotely matter for retail traders and there is a zero % chance BBBY ever gets “squeezed.” 

Plus, who do you think you’re buying all your shares from? They own 99.49%. 


(SI is a contextual number. Soooo context is key)."
2021-06-20 05:14:53,wallstreetbets,"If it isnt a good investment, it isnt a good trade.

A lot of noobs throughout history have thought they could time the market, and maybe a few times they could....until they couldn't anymore.  

Most of this crowd doesnt have the kind of capital on hand to afford to get it wrong, even once.  

The house always wins because it can afford to absorb losses on the way to gains from gambling, while retail players cannot."
2021-06-20 16:03:04,wallstreetbets,"No we are here, just in different accounts. We greedy too."
2021-06-20 01:57:21,wallstreetbets,I'm new but I ain't falling for this $hit. Can't lose money if you don't have money
2021-06-19 22:46:09,wallstreetbets,"I don't know when OP bought these contracts, but they should have sold long before expiration.  $WISH has been doing well, and his bad bet has nothing to do with the stock or company."
2021-06-20 08:51:49,wallstreetbets,"That isn't true at all.  Some of my biggest gains have been on stocks I wouldn't invest in.  Even if you think the business model is doomed, if the stock is more than -50% from IPO on one piece of bad news, but the fundamentals are still decent and it's way undervalued compared to peers, and people are hyping it, it's a pretty safe bet on a significant bounce.  You just have to plan your exit.

Besides that, the arguments that Wish is a bad investment are weak.  I could have argued why it was a good investment... But it didn't matter.  It doesn't have to be a good investment to be a good trade, and this is WallStreetBets, not WallStreetInvestments.

But for why I think the arguments against Wish are weak, think Dollar General.  You don't have to sell quality shit to be hugely successful.  People incorrectly assume that just because the products are not to their taste, it can't be successful.  WalMart and Amazon sell both shit and quality stuff.  Dollar General, Craiglist, EBay, Facebook markets, Wish - mostly shit but still successful.  And just because Wish has a lot of low quality shit now doesn't mean they will remain that way.  You gotta develop a customer base somehow, and Wish did it by selling things cheap.  Once they have the customers, they can start improving the quality and margins.  The recent partnership with Prestashop shows they're on the road to improvement.

You don't just assume because you don't like it, it's a bad investment.  You look at the numbers.  And so far, Wish's revenue keeps growing significantly.  That says you're wrong.  Wish is a decent investment - but an even better short term BET... And let's not forget where we are."

2021-06-19 20:01:27,wallstreetbets,Yeah totally changed after gme
2021-06-20 04:27:50,wallstreetbets,This is a fucking snake pit we don’t band together. We get rich individually off blood money.
2021-06-19 20:18:36,wallstreetbets,"It was small before. There was 50k of us. Not 5m. It used to be just us autists who enjoyed long shot stock plays. Now there’s normies, market bros, pump chasers, media, sec, all kinds of cretins. 

Someone super close to me is on a daytime business news show. I’ve been using Reddit for a long time and have mentioned wsb to them many times over the years. Shown them some posts like the famous “guh” or the guy who put 400$ into long calls for Tesla when it was new for like a year out that went itm by like 115$ a contract. He only paid like 20$ per contract or some bullshit like that. Made like 1.7m.

Reddit has been on their radar since January. But as of June, and the amc squeeze the whole show team has accounts now and are in here trying to pump people for their thoughts and sharing peoples comments like it’s news lmao.

They asked me to send them a link I had found, the ops username was like analplugbouncyball or some shit. They were about to air it and I was like, “you guys sure you wanna use that? Because You should really credit the creator of the post if you’re going to....” they caught it then lol 

It’s just remarkable how we went from a joke to not only relevant but a cornerstone of the market. We are the underground so to speak. Odds are in a year or so all these stupid meme plays will have launched at some point. That’s not to say they’ll keep remarkably high values, but they’re all gonna pump once the shorts back down a bit. Too many people going after heavily shorted medium/small caps for them to stay down. We’re def changing the fundamentals of the market. Even if only temporarily."
2021-06-20 12:23:41,wallstreetbets,"Excuse me sir, this is a wsb.... we don’t make money here."
2021-06-20 05:40:33,wallstreetbets,"Are you me? Same exact options, bought when SPY was 423. Fuck"
2021-06-20 09:39:53,wallstreetbets,LOL people are actually buying spy calls right now?
2021-06-19 23:48:02,wallstreetbets,"I think you are fine, plenty of time and spy already hit RSI below 30 last 3 days twice, its gonna recover soon."

2021-06-20 17:36:15,wallstreetbets,not really right now the volitility is Hella low which is why it's a great play
2021-06-19 20:40:20,wallstreetbets,ya well you have to buy before prime day and sell during prime day.
2021-06-20 17:36:50,wallstreetbets,ya I lost 10k once
2021-06-20 16:41:50,wallstreetbets,"I'm not playing any news, I'm playing prime day.  the stock usually pumps on prime day.  I expect it to gap up to $3550-$3580 overnight ans I plan on selling tomorrow around 10:30am and 11:00am at $3695.  If the stock doesn't gap up I'll look to close the position between 9:00-10:30. 

I'll look to buy a $80 otm put on Tuesday that I plan on selling Wednesday, then I'll look for another long call entry the following week to play earnings.  the stock has sat within the same range for the last 3 quarters and I expect it to start looking to move into a new resistance in July and August.

If it doesn't work then I'll update my resume and go get a job. Easy peezy"

2021-06-20 00:53:57,wallstreetbets,Imagine working your ass off your whole life to provide for your family just to have your son YOLO the entire thing in the stock market - and a meme stock specifically. Your 'you only live once' attitude will not help you when you need to pay your bills. Best of luck to you regardless.
2021-06-20 14:41:41,wallstreetbets,AMC would’ve made your dad proud.  This just makes him turn over in his grave.
2021-06-20 00:48:28,wallstreetbets,Shhh don’t tell him the one secret Short hedge funds don’t want him to know!

2021-06-20 01:26:41,wallstreetbets,Bro you really on here bitching on every single comment.  This subreddit is literally about gambling big on high risk plays.  No one give af about all that bullshit if u can play the volume & double or triple up on hype.
2021-06-20 12:14:47,wallstreetbets,I don't think proud is the word I would use if my retarded son gambled and lost my entire life's work on a shitty meme company
2021-06-19 20:40:30,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the honest advice. Just see wish everywhere and YoLos🤪 wanted to wrinkle the brain. Beware the bots!
2021-06-19 20:48:01,wallstreetbets,"Absolutely. Rev up YoY, insane scalability, 90% purchases all done on mobile, growth potential on WISH local, and bringing fun to shopping. Most importantly, severely undervalued ATM. 

Diversification is a crack shit theory they teach you in business school. Better to centralize in high conviction plays. See Buffett or Monger; they focus on 3-5 companies at a time."
2021-06-20 18:21:46,wallstreetbets,"Honestly I like WISH. Not fucking 18,000 shares. Maybe 100 max as a spec investment."
2021-06-20 12:57:53,wallstreetbets,Lol. Shill
2021-06-20 17:49:42,wallstreetbets,a little hyperbole to say it’ll go to zero 😂. shorting the stock much? hmmm
2021-06-19 21:19:11,wallstreetbets,When did I say it would or wouldn’t moon?? I was just commenting on the company.
2021-06-19 23:52:52,wallstreetbets,They are pump and dumping to stay solvent… they clearly have major influence on this sub
2021-06-20 01:22:09,wallstreetbets,I'm also debt free. Rent paid twelve months in advance. Six figure income and wouldn't even dream of yoloing 200K. Don't do this to yourself. no other meme stock has squeezed. You think this will be different? No. Sell whilst you're in profit
2021-06-20 00:59:50,wallstreetbets,Hmmmm
2021-06-19 21:36:47,wallstreetbets,11 bucks is a pump and dumb? Really? How dumb are you?
2021-06-20 00:41:09,wallstreetbets,"Sir, you could of just say it's undervalued."
2021-06-19 21:12:12,wallstreetbets,"I sent it to you the first time you asked, stop spamming."
2021-06-20 03:01:38,wallstreetbets,"This sub is gambling on high risk plays, this post is a clear bot network attempting to rob people.  Check out OP, less than a year and all of his post history is shilling WISH."
2021-06-19 21:14:34,wallstreetbets,"Thats blatantly false, you know that right?"
2021-06-20 18:27:28,wallstreetbets,"But why though?  Every metric shows the company in decline, their public image is shit because they lied to their investors, and it's almost exclusively a slave labor ecommerce outlet."
2021-06-20 13:20:53,wallstreetbets,"You the shill, OP is a shill bot and WISH is a shitadell pick."
2021-06-20 17:53:33,wallstreetbets,"It ain't shorted, because theres no need to short it, because nobody wants anything to do with this company.

If you show me some fail to deliver evidence maybe I'd believe a little bit of your bullshit, but right now all I have to go on are the company's statements, the news, and this post made by a 1y account whose only post history is shilling."
2021-06-19 21:37:41,wallstreetbets,Oh okay. Gotcha
2021-06-20 02:06:11,wallstreetbets,Nice bro sounds like you’re doing well! I’m glad to hear. But I like taking big risks for big rewards
2021-06-20 06:13:23,wallstreetbets,Are they a Chinese company? Lying to investors to not lose trust is totally what a Chinese company would do.
2021-06-19 21:13:34,wallstreetbets,"You sent me a lawfirm marketing advertisement, nothing more. What you sent is seriously invalid proof. Stop spamming these boards with your falsehoods and spreading FUD without facts to back your claims."
2021-06-19 21:36:22,wallstreetbets,No it’s not. Every SPAC has lawsuit news before every merger and so does every other stock when they dip heavily. You’re a troll.
2021-06-20 18:31:16,wallstreetbets,Good points. I’d pick some up in the $8 range for sure as a spec. It’s coming down. Perhaps another squeeze could send it higher. Maybe they cleanup their image a bit with some damage control. It’s one of the handfuls I check every few days to see if it goes in that low $8 dollar range. CLOV is another
2021-06-20 15:24:14,wallstreetbets,How much they pay you shills?
2021-06-19 23:24:23,wallstreetbets,"This is the point that some doubters are missing. Fuck the meme status or speed of the rocket on this, this is a sound stock pick at these levels. Only bear case is opportunity cost of your cash holding through a market dump before it coming back."
2021-06-19 21:12:56,wallstreetbets,You are spreading misinformation and FUD.  This lawsuit is from shareholders like us retail investors at WSB.
2021-06-19 21:13:49,wallstreetbets,You are a shill spreading misinformation.
2021-06-19 21:17:16,wallstreetbets,I sent you the timeline of events leading to the lawfirm and how to join if you were one of the impacted shareholders.
2021-06-20 17:20:30,wallstreetbets,How much they pay you shills?
2021-06-19 21:16:36,wallstreetbets,"Not even close. You sent a lawfirm advertisement. Nice try, you're a complete hack."
2021-06-19 21:17:19,wallstreetbets,"Not even close. You sent a lawfirm advertisement as your proof. Laughable. Nice try, you're a complete hack."
2021-06-19 21:18:36,wallstreetbets,"You probably work for this lawfirm, promoting their advertisements. You're a complete hack."

2021-06-20 05:13:14,wallstreetbets,"Michael Burry is calling for the “Mother of all crashes” and it worked out for him last time. I wouldn’t personally buy puts or even short SPY, but it may call for caution"
2021-06-20 00:07:46,wallstreetbets,"Options are lottery tickets. You can buy (or sell) the ETF and not die a slow theta death while you pray for moons...

The reality of options is like slot machines. Eveyone is quick to post a screenshot or picture of a jackpot, but no one would be interested in a thousand pictures of expiring OTM options. Those few screenshots of the wins taint the perception that buting options is a 50/50 play.

The house always wins."

2021-06-20 01:17:33,wallstreetbets,"Not like I had ever visted WSB on more than only a couple occasions before hearing about DFV and the run on GME and other stocks shorted by the HF's, so take what I'm about to say for what you will. I'm sad to say, but seems overwhelmingly evident that outside influences have exploited this forum in the interest of initiating ""pump and dumps"" of stocks they are holding some position on. In other words, forces are using WSB to prey on unexperienced and unsophisticated retail investors via hype and aspirations to ""get rich quick (who doesn't want to do that, afterall). Not every stock mentioned on WSB (even those with seemingly sufficient backing, as represented by frequent mentions) have what I would consider products and overall business models that seem promising and therefore profitable in the long-term (WISH comes to mind, but there are plenty others)

My advice, again as somewhat of a newbie when it comes to trading stocks and in-particular options: do your own due diligence. If a company offers products or services you believe are subpar or based on the \[lack of\] merits are unlikely to persist in the long term, stay away. I'm not saying that the WSB community isn't a place full of smart people with amazing insight and therefore the potential to make money. What I am saying is (like anything in life), be skeptical and rely on your own research and even intuition to spend your money wisely."
2021-06-20 00:12:10,wallstreetbets,How big is your position
2021-06-19 20:40:10,wallstreetbets,I’m doubling down with shares
2021-06-19 20:39:02,wallstreetbets,Under 12.5? I need 45
2021-06-20 00:16:35,wallstreetbets,"10 contracts and I sold 5 on one of the jumps the other day.

also got 100 shares, I'm tired of getting burned with meme stocks so I decided a few grand at most lol"
2021-06-20 00:19:58,wallstreetbets,Tbh I think it’ll hit $15-$20 range by 7/16 but I’m also retarded and biased. The volume goes up hella daily which gets me excited. My next YOLO will for sure be only shares tho that’s the least retarded way. I was really high when I placed these options but I don’t regret it because I’m gonna have great gain porn or even better loss porn and I love the casino
2021-06-20 00:22:25,wallstreetbets,"LEAPS are another way to do it relatively safely. Theta won't rip your cheeks 😂

2021-06-19 20:52:21,wallstreetbets,Yea that would minimize the risk though lol.
2021-06-19 22:09:55,wallstreetbets,"Totally agreed.  Sounds risky as hell, Jeff must need a wheelbarrow to carry around those huge balls..."
2021-06-19 20:08:09,wallstreetbets,Perfect...  There's even a phallic TRP over the right shoulder.
2021-06-20 16:31:24,wallstreetbets,I'm a really really big retard and Amazon has been pushing the over sold button for a long time now who knows how long the fuse is might be a long wait for ya. Make sure you hold back enough to cover just in case. As a tard did i get that right
2021-06-20 03:05:27,wallstreetbets,"I mostly don’t trust anything I read online. Everyone’s trying to sell you something. There’s a very few people that share useful information, then there’s 98% clueless sheeps following the crowd, then there’s me, sifting through the shit."
2021-06-19 22:24:09,wallstreetbets,"Hedge funds are fucked. They can’t even drop the price using illegal market manipulation practices. Trading 60% of the daily volume routed through dark pools and still cannot win. They have 8 million FTDs due this week, so we’ll see how that works out for them. They should have covered a long time ago, but they didn’t."
2021-06-20 00:12:46,wallstreetbets,Retail own more than 80% of the stock. All those short positions have to get covered at some point because hedge funds who are short are down 500% the idea is how much loss is too much lost for the hedge funds because once one of them crack the rest will follow. So going from 10 to 72 was literally like 1.5 mill shares that was covered now imagine when they cover everything
2021-06-20 00:15:13,wallstreetbets,Deep fucking Value waited a year for GME to squeeze. I’ve been holding amc since the stock was at 1.99$ my guts told me not to sell then and now so I will not sell till it moons all the DDs are here all the proof you need is there. AMC is a much better play in the market and for the past week it’s been closing 10$ above current price it’s only a matter of time before it shoot up
2021-06-20 00:58:07,wallstreetbets,This account is a shill account. Post history was focused solely on some shit called Dragalia Lost. All of a sudden OP starts posting 4 months back during the GME run up and now this thread. Fuck off OP and tell kenny to shove some mayo up his ass

Hi Kenny"
2021-06-20 15:25:45,wallstreetbets,Its almost like you don't understand that technicals go over probabilities not certainties. Most of the youtube videos and posts I saw doing DD understood this. I guess you didn't.
2021-06-20 15:51:28,wallstreetbets,"Then short it, bitch."
2021-06-20 19:56:18,wallstreetbets,AMC is a hedge against inflation and a nice store of value

2021-06-20 17:14:49,wallstreetbets,"Do you have an exit plan?  If you've been holding since $2, then you will continue to hold when it's $70, and probably continue to hold when if it hits $150 and will probably continue to hold when it's $1,000.  The same people will continue holding forever until the day comes when they realize they've been left holding the bag.  Gains are not realized until they've actually been sold.  I feel like most apes on this forum don't even know what an exist strategy is."
2021-06-20 17:11:38,wallstreetbets,"This just proves how clueless the sheeps are on reddit.  Sometimes the full retard apes can't get out of their own way.  As I've already mentioned in countless other replies, I was largely inactive on WSB because I only learned about it when the GME hype was going on.  Since then, I've studied up and learned alot about how the market works.  I certainly can't claim to know everything, but I know stupidity when I see it.  And there's an awful alot of hive-minded mob mentality retardation going on here.    


I never predicted what the AMC price will be.  I could be right, I could be wrong.  All I'm saying is that for those fools who are still buying at $50-60 out of sheer FOMO and putting all their eggs in the AMC basket as if it was the only golden ticket in the entire market is taking huge, unnecessary risks imo.  Hedge fund sharks who are worth their salt would have already made the necessary plays to hedge their AMC losses to the point where they can patiently ride this stock for months (maybe even years) to come and string us along all the while recuperating their losses in other market opportunities.  

TL;DR - buy the stock if you're confident you've done the DD.  Don't dump your life savings into a meme stock because someone cussed at you online and posted a bunch of rocket/moon symbols."

I was directing the majority of my OP to people who are still yolo'ing their entire savings at $50-60 entry point out of pure FOMO thinking that AMC is their golden ticket to becoming a millionaire.  There are smart apes and then there are the mob-mentality flock of sheep that follow anyone hoisting a rocket symbol.

2021-06-20 04:27:47,wallstreetbets,Not at theoment ✌✌✌✌
2021-06-20 14:19:03,wallstreetbets,"Shorts don't have to cover if they're hedged with calls - which you have no idea if they do or not. Price can't skyrocket unless they're actually margin called - which again may not happen because you don't know the full extent of their short positions. 

Then you have to contend with repeated stock offering otherwise AMC goes under with 6B net debt, the CEO himself said so with an interview with Trey. Good luck finding institutions to buy in at these prices. At best they'll do convertible debt which they can then convert to equity for sale just like Mudrick did.

""if no one sells"" is the stupidest shit I've ever heard, and this is coming from a GME holder. There is no way NO ONE SELLS. The moment the market goes for correction, existing institutions will take their 500% gain straight away."

2021-06-20 16:59:27,wallstreetbets,are you actually guaranteeing that a short squeeze is coming?  Anyone who claims to have irrefutable proof and knowledge of that and state it like it was a fact would be just as dumb (if not dumber).
2021-06-20 16:58:13,wallstreetbets,Do you struggle with reading comprehension?  I literally said that in my OP.  Nobody ever claimed it was a short squeeze.  The short squeeze has not happened nor will it ever happen at this rate.  Learn how to read before you flame on someone's post.

2021-06-20 10:39:41,wallstreetbets,"Depends, generally IV crush would be your worry there. However the nature of a Out getting ITM tends to suggest stock price decline which tends to push IV up not down. I'm not well educated on IV and it's movement vs price though."
2021-06-20 06:18:06,wallstreetbets,"You do know a hedge fund has investments elsewhere. Melvin capital lost like 50% just in January and they are worth 8b. Citadel the biggest of them all is 35b. 

The rest that aren't as big will fall first and quicker which will lead the price Higher and higher and higher causing a Domino effect that will eventually reach the big HFs. Plus, it's not like they are keeping a short position open on a stock that never changes price."

But it's cool man. No need to have polite discourse if it's not worth your time. 👍"
2021-06-20 13:30:21,wallstreetbets,Unless they are covered you would be accepting unlimited upside risk. If they are covered (owning 100 shares per contract sold) then you are just capping your gains and/or betting the MOASS doesn't happen before your contract expires. Writing covered calls during high IV is a legit srategy

1. No. Opposites do attract but then repels once in contact and flipped. 

2. Marriage is not forever but kids are. So be prepared if you have kids to suck up a bunch of misery just to make life tolerable for them. Kids change you. You would die for them , which make you die a little every day knowing you are unhappy and there is a fair chance they know you are too. 

3. Please just be careful before you commit. My heart hurts tonight as it has for years. It’s my own problem but I didn’t see it coming years ago. Cheers"

2021-06-20 13:26:19,wallstreetbets,"Sp500 forward PE is 21.70, while historical average is ~ 16. The forward PE is only justifiable if the earnings growth outlook keeps improving beyond expectations going forward. That narrative is being challenged with credit spreads narrowing between long duration and short duration bond yields. At the moment, the bond market is suggesting we are already past peak growth. So, if that is the case, forward PE contraction based on earnings growth sounds like fantasy talk.

The market can still keep going up, another 10% or 20%, if enough people decide to brush aside the facts and say PE doesn't matter anymore. But will they? Historically, at some point, someone always blinks and then the others rush to the door, trying to exit before the others do.

This isn't just US. Central banks have bet big everywhere with their policies that the recession would be short lived. Markets have gone up in anticipation of that. This is happening in DAX, FTSE, SP500, STOXX, and emerging markets."

And live in hilltop houses, driving 15 cars
The girls come easy, and the drugs come cheap
We'll all stay skinny, 'cause we just won't eat

And we'll hang out in the coolest bars
In the V.I.P. with the movie stars
Every good gold digger's gonna wind up there
Every Playboy Bunny with her bleached blond hair

And we'll hide out in the private rooms
With the latest dictionary, and today's who's who
They'll get you anything with that evil smile
Everybody's got a drug dealer on speed dial, well

2021-06-19 21:47:41,wallstreetbets,"For all you uncultured snowflakes, here’s a jewel for ya…

Well, I woke up Sunday morning,
With no way to hold my head that didn't hurt,
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't bad,
So I had one more for dessert

Then I fumbled in my closet through my clothes,
And found my cleanest dirty shirt,
Then I washed my face and combed my hair,
And stumbled down the stairs to meet the day

I'd smoked my mind the night before,
With cigarettes and songs I'd been pickin',
But I lit my first and watched a small kid,
Playing with a can that he was kicking

Then I walked across the street,
And caught the Sunday smell of someone's fryin' chicken,
And Lord it took me back to something that I lost,
Somewhere, somehow along the way

On a Sunday morning sidewalk,
I'm wishing Lord that I was stoned,
'Cause there's something in a Sunday,
That makes a body feel alone

And there's nothin' short of dyin',
That's half as lonesome as the sound,
Of the sleeping city sidewalks,
And Sunday morning coming down

In the park I saw a daddy,
With a laughin' little girl that he was swinging,
And I stopped beside a Sunday school,
And listened to the songs they were singing

Then I headed down the street,
And somewhere far away, a lonely bell was ringing,
And it echoed through the canyons,
Like a disappearing dreams of yesterday

On a Sunday morning sidewalk,
I'm wishing  Lord that I was stoned,
'Cause there's something in a Sunday,
That makes a body feel alone,

And there's nothin' short of dyin',
That's half as lonesome as the sound,
Of the sleepin' city sidewalks,
And Sunday morning coming down"

Seize every special moment with the feeling that your father would be proud, remember his quirks with humour and pride. 

Mine for example, had a tradition of putting on leather driving gloves. It wouldn’t matter if we were rushing to get somewhere, he’d take 10 seconds to pop them out, slide them on and then turn the key. In his honour, I bought driving gloves and now every day in my car, I think of him. It’s a small thing but damn it carries so many memories. 

It gets easier with time, for now, grieve and remember as much as possible. You’ll do him proud ❤️"

2021-06-19 21:30:45,wallstreetbets,"Oh stop with ur lies. WISH is going nowhere. Just because your firm brought many shares thinking they can get us to buy doesn’t mean anything. We ain’t falling for ur crap go back to your bosses and tell them that. 

You can bombard this sub with many posts about WISH but we ain’t falling for the crap company. It had no value and there’s only bad experiences with WISH if anyone used it."

2021-06-19 21:44:00,wallstreetbets,"Then make it make sense. Why da fk should anyone buy WISH stonk?!

WISH is an app that has bad reviews. Just do a YouTube or Google search and you’ll see videos of people opening stuff they’ve brought on their and how it’s cheap and not what they thought it was."
2021-06-19 22:06:53,wallstreetbets,God damn troll https://fintel.io/ss/us/wish
2021-06-19 22:05:27,wallstreetbets,"It’s pretty clear to me. Increasing percentage of shorts plus and actually pretty strong revenue stream. Those bad reviews are partly what’s causing the shorts. I’m in this space and I personally agree, but I also know where the other marketplaces are also and can say, if WISH pulls their head out of their ass they have a killer biz, which will drive price. If they don’t, I’m standing against the shorts and hoping others will too because WS would love to see these guys die, just like other stonks on here. And btw, fuck WS."
2021-06-19 22:16:32,wallstreetbets,https://fintel.io/ss/us/wish
2021-06-20 01:14:41,wallstreetbets,"Dude do you even fking know what WISH is?!

It was never a successful app. It’s an app you buy fking knockoff crap from China and even in knockoff standards it’s bad quality etc. 

You have no idea what it is. Just do a simple search and you’ll see many videos and complaints from people who’ve brought stuff from WiSH app. They either never got what they paid for or if they got it it’s cheap and not what was advertised.

How da fk am I a troll for NOT going along the idiotic move to buy into a knockoff app from fking China 🤦🏻‍♂️"
2021-06-20 01:12:13,wallstreetbets,"No WISH isn’t a good thing whatsoever. Do you even know what it is?

It’s a knockoff app where u order knockoffs from China and even as a knockoff it’s bad. Anything"
2021-06-20 01:17:31,wallstreetbets,"No one likes WISH app. It was never successful. You’d have to be a moron to think this will become the next meme stonk. You idiots been flooding this sub with WISH the last couple days and we ain’t falling for it. 

Buy it if you want but it’s a waste. No one likes WISH. There’s nothing to it. No nostalgia factor nothing. 

Leave us alone about this WISH bs app. All it is is knockoffs from China and even that it’s bad knockoffs."
2021-06-20 15:15:42,wallstreetbets,"There’s plenty of pie for the both of us. But don’t assume you understand all the reasons that stonks become what they are. Nostalgia didn’t drive shit.

Saying that as a holder in both of the memes that you’re referring to to"

Now go out and get some Friends kid <3"
2021-06-20 11:11:31,wallstreetbets,"I bought AMC at $8 dumb ass. Meanwhile you're being tricked by hedge funds to buy TRASH like WISH & CLOV... Oh and buying AMC at $60 still better than WISH @ 0.01 LOL.

Now maybe help your mom financially so she's not on food stamps. Get a better job loser and stop playing video games and looking up vape tricks. 

When you have a big boy job and you can help your mom, then you can play some video games. LMAO!"
2021-06-20 11:28:17,wallstreetbets,"Haha you really need to get your self a life. The foodstamp card was a joke, but You are CLEARLY too autistic, to understand what that is.. srry but youre the loser here bye kid."

2021-06-19 21:57:15,wallstreetbets,Happens all the time. Look at Oracle last week. I only know this because it nailed me.
2021-06-19 21:56:05,wallstreetbets,Don’t feel pressure to invest more than you want to obv. One share is fine. On something like robinhood or whatever you can buy fractional. Good luck!

2021-06-20 04:41:28,wallstreetbets,Buying GME options with a break even over like $310? Yikes
2021-06-20 19:24:18,wallstreetbets,"I agree. It's already at close to $20 (Yelp right now is at under $40 with an ATH of $94). I own some, but definitely can't see this go anywhere over $50 (even with US National Legalization). It's niche and someone will come along who will do it better (and probably will be more than one). At that point, social media and word of mouth will dictate whether it survives. I love the stock, but definitely not a long term hold. I equate it to MySpace or Napster. It's the first (which helps us initial investors), but it's far from being the best or last."
2021-06-20 03:38:28,wallstreetbets,Already went from $2 to $80. You're late to the party!
2021-06-20 02:20:59,wallstreetbets,Ban
2021-06-20 01:17:23,wallstreetbets,Lmfao played yourself of a momentum stick smh
2021-06-20 11:06:12,wallstreetbets,"Given that I’m still very bearish that this current elevated price can last, that’d need to be pretty deep OTM for me to feel comfortable selling them. How far OTM would you be looking, how far out in time, and how wide of a spread?"
2021-06-20 11:15:30,wallstreetbets,I only go ITM with put spreads. Bottom leg always 30-40% safety net in case of underlying drop.

2021-06-20 09:12:01,wallstreetbets,CLF means easy long and short term 💸🚀
2021-06-20 07:21:21,wallstreetbets,"CLF was a miner. Now they are a producer. They mine their own ore and now they can smelt it and turn it into steel products. 

As a metaphor, if before they were a cattle farmer, then they basically just bought a beed jerky factory from MT.

MT used the money to buy back their shares. This has already happened. It has no effect on CLF anymore. If you see a lot debt on CLF it's from buying the MT production facilities. The CEO has already said that he's going to aggressively pay off the debt with future profits. They expect to have everything paid off by the end of next year. He basically timed the market perfectly (through luck or skill doesn't really matter) as the steel prices skyrocketed almost immediately after they bought everything."
2021-06-20 09:09:31,wallstreetbets,I like 25 eow CLF🚀
2021-06-20 08:07:47,wallstreetbets,"Thank you for this ELI5. Makes sense.

2021-06-20 13:05:07,wallstreetbets,How did you end up like this? Hasn’t anyone given you advice to roll them when in green?
2021-06-19 22:09:30,wallstreetbets,LOL …. I’ve done my DD and believe $CLOV is going to rocket.  I’m expecting to at least triple my money (my opinion and not financial advice).   Learned a long time ago you don’t get rich by putting money in a savings account.  Don’t see anything to worry about brother 😎
2021-06-20 13:13:53,wallstreetbets,"Since the option does not expire until July 18, I have a bit of time left. Maybe rolling it is a good idea. Is that what you would do?  I generally sell options when they are in the green. I haven’t had many expire worthless."
2021-06-19 21:03:52,wallstreetbets,50% is high? But above 90 is insane? I assume shorting through ETFs

2021-06-20 09:38:52,wallstreetbets,I’ll post the math going into this week later this afternoon…

2021-06-20 15:32:02,wallstreetbets,"We don’t actually know how accurate that is, a lot of shady stuff going on, volume not matching the float, there’s short positions backing short positions, it’s bullshit backed by bullshit. And those of us holding the heavily shorted stocks are gonna make out great, but if they get margin called it could wreck the entire market. That being said, my small account does have WKHS, let’s go!"
2021-06-20 02:22:32,wallstreetbets,You do realize there are workhorse vehicles running around through Amazon prime and UPS right? Like cut this bullshit FUD. They might not get usps but there is a bunch of other customers waiting to be tapped into

2021-06-19 22:56:40,wallstreetbets,"First, fuck off. 
Secondly, fuck off. 
Thirdly, literally no one can fucking predict the market and thinking it will go to $1 is equivalent of you saying workhorse is a complete scam which it’s far from. 

And lastly… fuck off. This conversation Is over. So, go ahead and fuck off little dick energy boy."
2021-06-19 23:02:27,wallstreetbets,"Look internet Tough guy, I'd hold you to those words if I could see your fucking ass.

2021-06-20 01:48:12,wallstreetbets,1000 shares @ $8.84
2021-06-20 00:15:34,wallstreetbets,"No. Typically when a mm sells you option, he’ll delta hedge them. Let’s say the delta on the $5 strike I own is .95. I bought them 4.80 in Friday. The MM will then go into the market and buy 95 shares to hedge his position. So you basically forced a purchase of 95 shares for $480 when purchasing 95 shares would cost you around 900. You’re putting more upward pressure on the stock with options.

Please stop actually being retarded."
2021-06-20 00:29:31,wallstreetbets,"They won’t buy it immediately because that will hurt their position altogether.
Especially, the position could already have been covered for.
You’re describing a scenario that no institution will take immediately because it makes no sense to push the price up when they can block trade it downwards in the case of AMC.
They also, don’t buy the bulk hedge shares Generally.
It’s a gradual accumulation.

Stop trying to be petty bro.

You’ve explained 1 part of the derivative market assuming nothing else changes. 
You’re also forgetting IV, Theta, gamma, Vega and Rho.
These, variables makes it advantageous to not immediately hedge. Since the MM are the ones who provide liquidity, it’s beneficial to repurchase the options from Traders and profit from the arbitrage.
The have algorithms doing this at all times.
But, if they manually bought shares. Immediately, it’ll undercut their algo’s effectiveness because delta is not constant."
2021-06-20 11:22:47,wallstreetbets,Still waiting to hear who is causing all of the meme stocks to explode if retails involvement in the market is meaningless and we are just along for the ride...
2021-06-20 00:34:01,wallstreetbets,"I bought 30 contracts of UWMC $5 strikes on Friday. If you think it wasn't hedged immediately, you're insane. Especially given the volatility. MMs make money on the spread. They don't want to be LONG or SHORT. If you think he's like I just sold these 30 contracts. Let me see if I can get a better price on the stock, it's just not happening. Being short could result in a huge loss very quickly. But yes you're correct that it does tie into his total position but the position does add a net delta of 2850 position which is a huge exposure to the underlying."
2021-06-20 12:00:51,wallstreetbets,Nobody said retail is completely meaningless but to think retail pushed GME to the moon on its own is asinine. Big money was behind that 100%
2021-06-20 00:45:56,wallstreetbets,"Like I said… you went off again describe 1 perfect scenario. This is not the case all the time. The moment you sell that contract the effects are reversed because that strike is deep in the money.

Now, if you’re thinking generally, people will buy near OTM or Nearest ITM contracts. That’s why they have the highest volume. Yet, these strikes tend to fall in/out of the money fairly easily. There’s no reason to hedge for it unless it’s trending/consolidating.

Remember to sell a call, you’d need to have 100 shares. They already have the 100 shares. There’s no reason to buy an additional 100 if it will be assigned in profit.

Delta Hedging happens when OTM contracts becomes near to or ITM contracts. Not immediately. If you bought the $5 strike, someone already had the 100 shares to write that contract and sell it to you…. there’s no immediate hedging because it’s deep in the money.

But if you bought The bulk of the $15. The MM will now provide liquidity if you decide to sell them and to reduce the cost of helping you liquidate, that’s when they hedge."
2021-06-20 12:16:52,wallstreetbets,"100%? So big money one day just all of the sudden decided it was time to send GME to the moon? 

Or maybe... retail was actually big enough to pin that big money in a corner forcing its hand to close out positions... meaning retail can make a stock move..."
2021-06-19 22:15:19,wallstreetbets,I assure you I appreciate all criticism. Please poke more holes in my ideas than my wife lets her boyfriend use.
2021-06-20 00:48:58,wallstreetbets,It's irrelevant in it's entirety. The guy I was commenting to was saying options don't put upward pressure on the price which was entirely incorrect. Of course I gave an extremely simple example. He was wrong.
2021-06-20 12:38:03,wallstreetbets,Keep dreaming bud
2021-06-20 00:55:52,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, he could of mentioned more accurately that it forces shares to be purchased/sold if the market conditions prompts MM to hedging. 👏"
2021-06-20 12:39:49,wallstreetbets,"I will until someone actually has some type of counter response that is logical. It always goes straight here.. I ask how or prove it and I get in return lol you're an idiot keep dreaming bud.

Not one single person has spelled out why GME wouldve happened in Jan with or without retail which is what they are suggesting by saying retail cant move the needle."

2021-06-20 12:06:11,wallstreetbets,"I strongly disagree, good luck."
2021-06-20 12:05:07,wallstreetbets,"I’m sure there are others but I am laser focused on AMC at the moment. Note that I would have sold if I thought AMC was done, I believe there is still a lot of room to run here. That being said any new entries would run into the share price issue and gains would not be as exponential. But gains are gains. Honest opinion is optimistically 3X-10X from this level. It’s much riskier here then when I entered, just like it was riskier when I entered (originally at $14ish) then those who entered at $7. It was also riskier for those who entered at $7 than those who entered at $2. The trade is still in play in my mind even at these levels. I have the risk tolerance for it though. Be careful, do your own DD and believe in yourself. You’ll have more knowledge after studying a stock for months than these idiots that publish 10 hit piece articles a day. Don’t trust the news only how people will react to it. Penny stocks can get you 5-10X returns easy if you pick the right one. Very high risk though. My plan after AMC is to compile a list of high momentum low price stocks that regularly spike and just watch. When the right one or 2 cool off and are boring enter 1/3 a position, if it falls enter 2/3, falls further full position. Then just hold through anything and wait for a pump and hope they don’t go bankrupt or dilute before a pump. Volatility = profit, many of these low price companies are a joke IMO. I think these stocks are there just to take long retail investors money. Study like 3 stocks very hard and learn. Please note this is advice from someone who started trading in April 2020. Good luck, I like it when the little guys win."

2021-06-20 19:06:04,wallstreetbets,"He was antagonized after the 08 crash for calling it. He was audited about 4 times and was approached by the feds multiple times regarding that prediction. Lots of higher ups were not happy with him, even his clients who made some great profits were upset with him. I personally don’t think he wanted to go through the trouble, and if he’s that confident in his bearish positions and the market having a total collapse, a billion dollars will look rather small if this plays out for him - he’ll play the game on the way back up if it does indeed crash. He’s set to profit both ways."

2021-06-19 20:43:38,wallstreetbets,"You obviously don't understand how this works.  From another thread I posted on today:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o374vm/why\_wkhs\_is\_going\_to\_be\_the\_next\_rocket\_ship\_to/h2cstr1/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o374vm/why_wkhs_is_going_to_be_the_next_rocket_ship_to/h2cstr1/?context=3)

***When a MM sells you calls they are now in a short call position - which is bad for them because now they are no longer delta neutral. MM's always want to be delta neutral - they make money on the bid / ask spread - not when a stock goes up or down.***

***If they don't remain delta neutral they could get blown out if a black swan event occurs - like a Sept 11, or a meme stock goes nuts like GME. And some do occasionally when they start using leverage and it goes against them.***

***Anyway - the way to offset being short a call is with a synthetic long call - returning them to delta neutral. So they would buy an equivalent of underlying shares and buy an equivalent amount of underlying puts which = a synthetic long call.***

***They now are short an actual call but own a synthetic long call. Stock goes up and the short calls are worth more (they lose money) but so are the shares they now own (making them an equivalent amount) offsetting any risk to them. Stock goes down - their shares are worth less but the long puts they own are worth more = offsetting any risk to them.***

&#x200B;

In other words, they don't give a fuck where the stock ends up at expiration. That isn't how they make their money, makes no difference to them which way it goes."

2021-06-19 23:37:47,wallstreetbets,"TA wise looks oversold, Friday bounced off nicely from key $20 support and closed just shy off $22.50 resistance on a red market day. 

Now fundamental wise, I can tell you this - as someone who’s been to east Asia few times after-class tutoring/education is ingrained in the culture there. The government will not and cannot kill the industry because there will always be a huge market demand for it. Chinese stocks in general have fared poorly since January, it is no surprise with all the worries over weekend tutoring ban that these stocks got beaten to the ground.

IMO next week (assuming the CCP actually announce details of the tutoring legislation details); we could potentially see an aggressive rebound based on a reverse “sell the rumour buy the news” sort of thing - basically, when people realize this company won’t be bankrupt and my target is $35 by EoW. 

To summarize, I’m short term bullish purely based on charting; exit point for me would be around $30-35. Not sure about long term and all my positions have a tight SL.
