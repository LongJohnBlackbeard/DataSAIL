2021-06-15 19:59:42,wallstreetbets,Cramer is on drugs. I would rather let my dog pick the next stock.
2021-06-15 19:46:52,wallstreetbets,I still can't scroll by one of these posts and not read the ticker as donkey kong
2021-06-15 19:39:27,wallstreetbets,Not selling until at least $60
2021-06-15 19:39:30,wallstreetbets,this is the way
2021-06-15 19:48:57,wallstreetbets,Based
2021-06-15 19:57:33,wallstreetbets,I got in as the price was recovering. Still think it has a ton of potential to run though.
2021-06-15 19:38:55,wallstreetbets,lfgooo
2021-06-15 19:58:00,wallstreetbets,Guh
2021-06-15 19:56:10,wallstreetbets,Foolish imo. Following to see if it turns into loss porn
2021-06-15 19:58:23,wallstreetbets,"This stock will go way past $60. To me, its a smart move to buy and hold as it will keep growing and growing. I bought a few months back @60 and went up to $72 then back down so I bought more. They are spending money to grow their business, well more then just sports gambling and fantasy. Sound investment IMO. Not financial advice 🤷🏻‍♂️"
2021-06-15 19:46:43,wallstreetbets,My hero 🍀 🚀
2021-06-15 19:39:13,wallstreetbets,"Only 150,000 more shares that can be borrowed. If price goes between $14-15 by Friday, it will fly due to the options chain."
2021-06-15 19:46:42,wallstreetbets,Clov to the moon. Fuck the haters and let's make them tendies. 🍀🚀🌈💰
2021-06-15 19:49:58,wallstreetbets,"On friday, your CLOV calls will rocket to Pluto! The moon ain't enough!"
2021-06-15 19:49:54,wallstreetbets,"Great move, the momentum will definitely help the squeeze. I was there for the 28 dollar mark with 450 stocks and I bought at 10 dollars but I see so much more potential out of this stock."
2021-06-15 19:39:19,wallstreetbets,CLOV to the moon u bouta get a Bugatti
2021-06-15 19:54:42,wallstreetbets,CLOV is gonna launch baby!

2021-06-15 19:56:44,wallstreetbets,Good luck to you buddy. I hope it works out in your favor
2021-06-15 19:46:32,wallstreetbets,It’s definitely shorted and someone pumped it up now they will have to cover if you can’t see that your blind have shares in all the failing company’s it’s an attack on short sellers who made a killing when the pandemic happened!!!
2021-06-15 19:40:47,wallstreetbets,Black or pinto?
2021-06-15 19:45:50,wallstreetbets,"A lot of people in the comments missed the boat last week I take it, clov is set for the next 2 weeks. Learn to day trade and you’ll be fine children!"
2021-06-15 19:45:32,wallstreetbets,Red is good. Makes tendies tastes good
2021-06-15 19:41:42,wallstreetbets,"Fuck the pinto, your getting a bike (peddle not motor) 😂😂"

2021-06-15 19:37:39,wallstreetbets,High si doesn’t mean short squeeze
2021-06-15 19:51:12,wallstreetbets,"Sir, your Pinto is on fire."
2021-06-15 19:39:30,wallstreetbets,it's only 22%..https://fintel.io/ss/us/clov
2021-06-15 19:41:10,wallstreetbets,This is a tough call. DKNG is the best move right now. But wish you the best. Hope we all make money!

2021-06-15 19:40:02,wallstreetbets,"Let's hope so,.. I'm still underwater."
2021-06-15 19:47:12,wallstreetbets,Options chain? I understand there are tons of options that expire friday but i thought that shares move price?
2021-06-15 19:54:59,wallstreetbets,Dont some of us have to sell some calls in the money to force shorts to buy from the limited float available and that is what pushes price up!! Without a cycle of selling the in the money calls we cant go higher.  It was this old dude with an accent on CNBC the other day and it made sense to me.
2021-06-15 19:54:03,wallstreetbets,$28.40 for me!
2021-06-15 19:39:49,wallstreetbets,100%. Scared money don't make money brah. There's a LOT of OTM puts that will have to be covered soon. I'll take my odds.
2021-06-15 19:41:25,wallstreetbets,That's of shares outstanding. Ortex has SI as a % of float pegged at 47% tonight.
2021-06-15 19:42:35,wallstreetbets,That’s short volume ratio. Lent dividend by volume.
2021-06-15 19:51:14,wallstreetbets,I mean if price gets in the money to execute options on Friday
2021-06-15 19:57:25,wallstreetbets,Executing the calls and purchasing the shares is what will drive the price up
2021-06-15 19:52:31,wallstreetbets,So if a ton of options are ITM that basically = a bunch of share buys right? That's my understanding of it
2021-06-15 19:56:00,wallstreetbets,Yes and since there are so few shares currently available the price will get pushed even hire
2021-06-15 19:27:19,wallstreetbets,I like your commitment to buying 1 share lmao
2021-06-15 19:29:57,wallstreetbets,"What is happening with BB it makes nearly a billion a year and its price bearly budgies, heavily shorted?"
2021-06-15 19:28:12,wallstreetbets,20 percent on the option to go. God speed retard. 🚀🚀🚀
2021-06-15 19:28:44,wallstreetbets,That would be such a pussy move
2021-06-15 19:36:19,wallstreetbets,I’m in the hole with that 6/18 $15.00 call as well.  😒
2021-06-15 19:26:06,wallstreetbets,"I would roll them over to a farther out date like Jan 2022, and I woulda done in the money calls, not financial advise but bb has a super low premium, you took a risky bet my man, the profits on the Jan 22. In the money calls wouldn’t have been as spicy but it would’ve still probably been super profitable if it spiked up, and way less risky"
2021-06-15 19:46:35,wallstreetbets,"Wont lie, I paper handed my blackberry today, was comparing the volumes on my watchlist and didnt feel like risking anymore $, put it towards crypto, that market is bound to run again soon then I'll be back for another bet. Should have chosen AMC, o well"

2021-06-15 19:28:51,wallstreetbets,VZIO has a growing advertising business and I think a lot of people do not realize this when they hear Vizio. This is only their first year in the ad marketplace. So much room for growth. At the price it is currently trading at - this is a buy imo.
2021-06-15 19:16:46,wallstreetbets,"Growth, reccuring revenue (subscription), etc?"

2021-06-15 18:55:25,wallstreetbets,Roku brand TVs = shit.   Roku boxes/sticks = best in the industry it’s quite frustrating that this company’s awesome operating system is stuck on such crap TVs where as their own in house hardware is the best streaming platform bar none
2021-06-15 18:47:17,wallstreetbets,calls on VZIO
2021-06-15 18:49:02,wallstreetbets,"ROKU has better margins, and I’m assuming most of vizios revenue comes from tv sales as to where Rokus sales are from advertising. Not to mention ROKU is also the dominant player in the field, with 50ish million accounts and I think Vizio has 11 million. But ROKU profits off their users better. Vizio is a tv company, ROKU is a software company that also sells hardware."

2021-06-15 18:50:40,wallstreetbets,"Lol. Cool. I’m long on BB too buddy. This “recent” patent is meaningless without BB confirming that it’s ACTUALLY recent. And again, I don’t see anything on their website to collaborate your post."
2021-06-15 18:40:44,wallstreetbets,It’s not on their Investor Page on their website. BB would have announced this shit.
2021-06-15 18:42:11,wallstreetbets,You said in another reply that it was awarded in 2017. Which is it?
2021-06-15 19:20:09,wallstreetbets,Sweet! Now they can enter several new patent disputes. They were running out of ways to spend their legal fees budget of 130% of revenue.

2021-06-15 19:09:44,wallstreetbets,I own both 🚀🚀🚀
2021-06-15 18:19:38,wallstreetbets,Buy both. UWMC has very strong value as does WISH. Let’s get them both to the moon.
2021-06-15 19:43:23,wallstreetbets,"I hope WISH investors make money, but I am all in with UWMC. Undervalued and profitable company that can also go parabolic with a little volume.

Other bullish signs and catalysts:

* Recent Insider buying (in the $9s)
* Russell index  - June 28th inclusion will start ETFs buying and other Russell tracking
* Dividend payout in Early July - Many whales and tutes will reinvest
* Q2 has been hinted to be a blowout.

In addition to what was said above:

* Buybacks
* High Open Interest
* Small float = easy to move
* Bullish CEO that hates shorts"
2021-06-15 18:13:38,wallstreetbets,I needed this write up to give me hope and my $11 calls for 6/18…. Lol
2021-06-15 19:05:50,wallstreetbets,I’m in deep because it’s a steal but I thought the monkeys and pumpers on social medias would jump on this. They are actually retarded since UWMC actually has some gme like conditions which they chase. This could have a run equal to RKT hitting the 40s.
2021-06-15 18:41:28,wallstreetbets,"I’m down for both, but UWMC is my favorite!"
2021-06-15 18:53:37,wallstreetbets,Buy both. Buy a bit more of UWMC. My contract expires Friday and I’m down 86% on it. 🤣
2021-06-15 19:05:24,wallstreetbets,"Why is everyone one stock vs another.
Can’t we be both???
Im in both. Wish and uwmc 🚀 🌙 lets all make money!"
2021-06-15 19:30:22,wallstreetbets,"UWMC is a sleeper waiting to explode past the moon, Mars, Saturn, and straight into Uranus. If it ever gets the attention it deserves (anything even *close* to CLOV or WISH levels) it's going parabolic. The stage is set and I think the shorts are doing everything they can to keep it under wraps."
2021-06-15 19:15:37,wallstreetbets,Im basically 70% $UWMC & 20% $WISH in my portfolio 🚀🚀🚀🚀
2021-06-15 19:29:11,wallstreetbets,"Agreed 100%

If UWMC had 1/5 of the volume, it’d take off. Hell, we had a 12% jump on Wednesday at 25 million, imagine 150million that the others are getting. At 100m shares outstanding and only 80m float (compared to Wish or AMC’s 480m and 330m), the equity of a single share is insane

Wish is a good stock/company as in it makes money, and I can see why someone would invest. But I’ve never understood why it’s so beloved here…they’re literally a Made In China™️ marketplace. Yes American consumers love $8 t shirts that wear out in 2 months and plastic jewelry that takes 4 weeks to deliver, but would I want that to be my portfolios defining nest egg ?"
2021-06-15 18:54:09,wallstreetbets,Bought 250 UWMC shares and July call options today. I hope wish takes off for the folks that are invested but I do think there are better stocks. Let's see how UWMC plays... may buy more tomorrow or later this week.

2021-06-15 18:39:58,wallstreetbets,Apples and bowling balls
2021-06-15 19:37:00,wallstreetbets,$15 strike FDs. 🔒
2021-06-15 18:17:10,wallstreetbets,I have followed DD's and they have failed me 9/10 times. I shall do the opposite and invest everything into WISH. Thanks!
2021-06-15 19:26:52,wallstreetbets,"1. Float size: WISH share float is around 338 million shares. Comparatively, UWMC is around 80m. WISH is 4x harder to move.

Float size is very loosely correlated with volatility. Volume is the most important variable. And Wish's volume today was 140M shares vs UWMC 6M. If you think otherwise, you clearly haven't been paying attention to AMC's run.

2) Dilution: IF WISH does rise again, they will keep dropping offerings on our heads. The UWMC CEO has already stated that he believes the company is undervalued and they have a share buyback program, there will be no dilution to stop the party.

How do you know that? Companies that have been dropping offerings are those that are massively overvalued according to analysts. Gamestop, AMC. Sure if WISH goes 10x like these two, they'll probably drop an offering, as would UWMC and literally even the most wsb friendly companies. But Wish is still massively undervalued according to analysts. WISH management is the least likely to drop an offering. Not to mention the whopping 1.6 Billion UWMC shares that various insiders can drop at any time. 

3) Option chain: Most of UWMC's options are ITM or ATM, whereas most of WISH's call options are OTM. This means that the closer we get to friday at the current price, the more buying pressure UWMC will have and the less WISH will have due to the difference in options that need to be hedged for. This is extremely important and combined with float size is a large reason why UWMC is such a good play for this week. Every day at open the stock is assaulted by shorts because they don't want the $10 calls to stay ITM, but with more volume this stock would explode.

[https://www.barchart.com/options/volume-leaders/stocks](https://www.barchart.com/options/volume-leaders/stocks)

Most traded options today. ctrl f UWMC nothing. Yes most of WISH's are otm. But those 11c for friday are bigger than the totality of UWMC itm options. If the 12.50 get in, then all hell would break loose. Such a thing is impossible for UWMC's tiny volume. If the UWMC 10c dont make it?

4) IV: Not only is the UWMC float smaller making it easier to move, but it has more ITM options at play magnifying that effect. IV is also lower on UWMC (100% vs 250%) making options cheaper by a VERY significant amount, increasing the probability of a very popular well known technical event.

Ya I agree, if you want lottery tickets, buy UWMC calls. Love how you're literally contrading your point #1 where you say that UWMC's volatility or as you call it ""ability to move"" is higher. The market clearly believes that WISH can move, unlike UWMC, hence, higher premiums.

&#x200B;

Edit : Also, WISH is much easier to meme with."
2021-06-15 18:28:17,wallstreetbets,"Love it


The fundies don't lie.

Plus $WISH is a meme"
2021-06-15 18:53:05,wallstreetbets,Float size has nothing to do with moving a stock. Increasing trading volume is what moves price and WISH has gone from 5-6M shares per day to averaging over 100M shares per day. UWMC trading volume has tripled at best. I think you're reading the odds wrong on this one.
2021-06-15 18:35:43,wallstreetbets,"uhhh bull, Wish is a real investment, multiple positive analysts, no offerings on the radar.. and it just so happens to be a WSB pick."
2021-06-15 18:29:42,wallstreetbets,WISH is a great company with strong fundamentals.  I invest in safe company with big potential. So today i am with WISH.
2021-06-15 18:14:40,wallstreetbets,"Stupid and biased nonsense. Wish has nearly 2b cash on hand. There is no offering coming.

Let's also ignore the fact that wish has 3b in revenue with only 7b market cap and trading at a 2 p/s.

Go pump your stonk without doing stupid comparisons."
2021-06-15 19:11:57,wallstreetbets,Lol. Uwmc literally has 1.6 billion shares. The moment insiders start dumping this is gonna be a disaster.
2021-06-15 18:18:34,wallstreetbets,You forgot to say that uwmc is also going to make half the money it made this quarter next 🤷🏽‍♂️
2021-06-15 18:14:28,wallstreetbets,I guess shills have abandoned clov for now
2021-06-15 18:39:43,wallstreetbets,"I think what he is saying is that one will make you significantly more money if they both moon the same amount, and I agree, you can tell when comparing the options pricing. And just fundamentally if I'm bagholding I think I would rather it be with a strong company."
2021-06-15 19:03:13,wallstreetbets,Exactly
2021-06-15 18:55:30,wallstreetbets,Good thinking!
2021-06-15 18:37:23,wallstreetbets,Same. I honestly just might send it on 1000 6/18 $12c contracts tomorrow on top of my 5k shares. They are so cheap and I have so much faith this rips by the end of the week.
2021-06-15 18:21:38,wallstreetbets,On Stock Market Live Josh mentioned awhile back that UWMC is tracking TLT very closely and it shows. Probably wont give you more confidence in your current short term position but for future reference the bond market/rates and uwmc appear to be closely correlated
2021-06-15 18:38:45,wallstreetbets,same. need something to chub me up a little
2021-06-15 19:09:47,wallstreetbets,Yeah I really haven't seen this free of a setup in a long time but people would rather bag hold and protect their pride. I have other plays I'm in as well but this was the last one I expected to be flat. Even if it doesn't take off this week I will be up a lot at some point in the future so it doesn't matter in the end.
2021-06-15 19:29:35,wallstreetbets,You got a whole 14% left to lose.

2021-06-15 19:28:48,wallstreetbets,I didn’t see it as an us vs them just a logical case for the easiest/quickest way to a short squeeze which is why I’m here. It’s just easier to pull off with uwmc and cheaper.

2021-06-15 19:33:34,wallstreetbets,A Russell inclusion is coming up so I would expect more buying in on the run up. I wouldn’t stay long because of an expected sell off just for the squeeze potential within the month.

They even charge a 10% uncapped fee to use their ATMs. They are literally the Walmart of strip clubs without the revenue (cookie cutter approach to management). Also, per one of the bartenders, Rick’s pioneered the “fake drink” scam (girl requests an alcoholic drink or shot for $10-$12, waitress has the bartender pour water into the glass instead of alcohol, both waitress and dancer split what the customer pays for the drink).

2021-06-15 17:53:31,wallstreetbets,I can not because the do not own more than 51% of clov. You’re right. “Mostly” is a strong. So I’ll rephrase it and say it is owned a decent amount by citadel.

2021-06-15 19:34:07,wallstreetbets,"What I meant is: they should taper, but they won't, because they can't.

Reasons:
1) Full employment is still yet to be reached
2) They don't account for asset inflation in any of their inflation measures, so can get away with the transitory narrative for consumer goods
3) Political pressure to not have a big stock market correction under a brand new administration
4) Old habit of kicking the can down the road for the problem to be dealt by 'someone else'

Edit: 5) The real problem is disinflation rather than inflation, when it comes to consumption. Fed is really scared of a deflationary bust rather than a inflationary bust. If they stop QE, the consumption in the economy would go down which will drive down growth and create a lot more problems than inflation would."

2021-06-15 19:48:53,wallstreetbets,"Doesn't sound at all like they ""should"" if they are supposed to taper when the economy can stand on its own. It is a long way from that. The job loss hit a lot of non-white collar sectors. Yet white collar are the workers who are actually doing the investing etc. The market is disconnected from the damaged part of the economy because the buyers here were so minimally affected by the pandemic. It's the people who can barely pay rent who are going through a rough time. They cant dream of sparing side money to invest, and so there's a huge disconnect. If white collars want to keep pump and dumping each other and their 401ks then have at it, it doesn't really mean anything about the state of the economy..."

2021-06-15 19:54:12,wallstreetbets,"That's how it would happen, if it happens. Tomorrow, they 'might' come out and say we will begin tapering come January 2022. Market would react and 'maybe' will undergo a correction

Fed's QE operations are no longer reflecting any positive for the economy. Retail sales are slumping again (today's data). Growth is probably beginning to plateau and go down. So all that narrative about a booming economy was probably all fiction

Fed might still continue QE based on full employment agenda/mandate. But at some time, it raises the question whether the benefit of that goal far outweigh the risks or not. If they achieve full employment one year from now, with housing prices way, way high, do they actually help the people or just the ones with means? I think it is too risky"

2021-06-15 17:49:42,wallstreetbets,"Price of containers is expensive because there simply isn’t enough containers to fill product to ship. 

I work in logistics and the ports are so fucked up right now, along with ship lines. Their costs are up, and yes container demand is at the highest ever seen pretty much but it’s due to the fact there’s simply not enough container capacity. Thus, shippers are paying ship lines an exorbitant amount of money to guarantee capacity. 

It’ll be a good quarter for them but it’s fucking the supply chain up so bad right now."

2021-06-15 17:16:49,wallstreetbets,Do some of these companies in the sector I mentioned not fit this? There are companies that have 20x in the 9 months. I believe that fits what you are looking for.

2021-06-15 17:31:00,wallstreetbets,Agreed. I am not saying the P/E is end all be all. It is 1 point. The dry bulk rates are trending higher and there are many macro events moving higher. The Containership lease rates and also at record highs and setting new records weekly. They are getting locked into 2-4 year contracts and very profitable rates. These seem like some great short to medium term bets to get a multi bagger on a company that is making money vs all of this DD on stocks that are losing money but might pop for a few days because of hype. I would think numerous users here would like to know about a relatively unknown sector that has the potential to return a significant gain in the near future. I just thought this was a good fit for those willing to take on large risks.
2021-06-15 17:33:41,wallstreetbets,Plus they mostly use death spiral financing.  Issue shares to raise money.  Spend money on things like new ships.  Hookers.  Issue more shares.  Do a reverse split to fix the depressed share price.  Issue more shares.  Get more hookers.  Repeat
2021-06-15 17:36:00,wallstreetbets,"This is so true, I agonized thought that oil tanker bs, thought I could make a few quick bucks and had to wait two or three months just to break even."
2021-06-15 17:53:54,wallstreetbets,Not just a Q. The liner companies are signing leases with the containership lease companies for 2-4 year leases at very high rates. There are some 10 year leases but those are at lower rates because of the safety. The real upside is in the ones who have charters rolling off and are renegotiating.
2021-06-15 17:07:49,wallstreetbets,I do get the feeling this might be why. But I thought the idea around here was make bets on stocks that can return a multi bagger. Not get married to just a few stocks.
2021-06-15 17:34:10,wallstreetbets,I know of the tankergang. But tankers are like saying AMC and blockbuster are the same.
2021-06-15 17:50:08,wallstreetbets,Tankers are different. But I am getting a feel for why it is not brought up here.
2021-06-15 19:36:50,wallstreetbets,"You hit 2 of the names. ZIM is a linear and I own them. However I am not sure they will be a multi bagger from here. I think NMM will be, but they have their own risks. I am wondering why more people do not want to discuss these. Nick and J are 2 writer/analysts who cover these names and know a ton and willing to explain a ton of stuff within the sector. IMO too many lump everything into shipping. When they are different, tankers are different then drybulk, which is different from liners who are different then ship leasing companies. 

&#x200B;

I personally think there are numerous names in drybulk that have major upside just like the containership lease companies. I think liner companies still have upside but they have a chance to be like the tankers where they see a quick fall off. Obviously Drybulk has same risk because they have shorter contracts so if spot market falls so would they. But their rates are near their 10 year high even after the latest pullback and now heading back up. The lease companies are the safest bet IMO because they are signing longer contracts. Anyway, my main point is, I hope people talk about them so others can find out if it is a sector that interest them."
2021-06-15 17:13:53,wallstreetbets,"I was long $TRTN however I sold them at $60. I have held them in the past for years, got lucky and sold Dec of 2019 and rebought after the huge drop. My biggest problem with them is containers can be made very quickly. The real shortage is ships to carry those containers. My belief is $TRTN is fair value and therefore not huge rise in price. But I will consider them in the future if the price keeps coming down because they are well run."
2021-06-15 17:18:02,wallstreetbets,"No, 9 months is a long term hold. We’re talking buy and sell within 1 week, 2 weeks tops! Anything beyond that was not what this sub was intended for. Options are the long plays buying stocks are for quick turnarounds."

It is easy for me to understand the value of company who will have a steady constant growth rate, cyclical companies with lumpy earnings that are based on factors completely out of their control are too much effort to evaluate."
2021-06-15 17:48:43,wallstreetbets,"If you lose on oil tankers why shun all shipping? Just because they are ships? If you lose on say Boeing, do you shun all airlines and defense sector? Their product and rates and different. The only common part is they use a type of ship. Not saying you are wrong to shun. Just curious your thoughts when they are different. I have found many do not really know the difference and just lump all ships are bad."
2021-06-15 18:06:39,wallstreetbets,"Honestly just invest in companies that produce the containers, those things are like gold right now."
2021-06-15 17:10:22,wallstreetbets,Ignore them. Make some great DD on a company in the field.
2021-06-15 17:09:20,wallstreetbets,Incorrect right now what AMC is gonna do is gonna be never probably repeated we havnt even started yet… we can worry about other stocks later right now all focus should be towards AMC it’s just a matter of time till all the apes rise…
2021-06-15 17:20:31,wallstreetbets,I believe roaring kitty held his GME for quite awhile before it became what it is today. I was reading an elder recently posted that a bet does not have to be a 1 or 2 week bet. It is just a bet for a multi bagger vs your 10% per year return type of buy.
2021-06-15 17:33:15,wallstreetbets,"I agree with the BS pump and dumps. I enjoy reading some decent DD that is based on logic and facts. Gambling is more than lady luck. Experience and Skill are major factors for increasing payout rates.  


That and all the pump and dump bots downvote anything that doesn't mention their stock."
2021-06-15 17:32:49,wallstreetbets,"I get what you are saying, but I really have to say this statement sounds like a boomer statement."
2021-06-15 17:45:31,wallstreetbets,">l have a steady constant growth rate, cyclical co

Fair point. This is what I am curious about. Is this the general sentiment. Or is it because of tankers last year. Maybe because it isn't a sexy sector and takes a lot to follow? Thx for your response."
2021-06-15 18:39:22,wallstreetbets,"I didn't lose, I broke even maybe made a couple bucks just wasn't the big, smart apish trade I thought it would be so I agreed with comment I was responding to about oil tankers when they should have been bleeding money last year is all. You do you, gl."
2021-06-15 18:09:04,wallstreetbets,Fair enough. I have been a big fan of TRTN for years. I do like their management team.
2021-06-15 17:35:36,wallstreetbets,Yea and everyone made fun of him
2021-06-15 17:21:58,wallstreetbets,But do you see him posting anymore? GME was the fluke in this sub (a one time thing) that all the newbies assume is what this sub is all about. Take a look at posts prior to GME and you’ll get a sense of what this sub was meant for.
2021-06-15 17:34:19,wallstreetbets,Exactly! I don’t even bother reading half the posts anymore because it’s the same pumper crap over and over again
2021-06-15 17:33:30,wallstreetbets,I’m 38 so definitely not a boomer 😂 just nostalgic for the way it was a year ago lol
2021-06-15 17:54:55,wallstreetbets,"No, this is just generally what happens in these type of cyclical industries. You can look at a stock like $Rkt for another example. The stock only seems to move sideways or down despite stellar earnings, but it’s because the bulk of their business is refinancing. They will do poorly in a rising interest rate environment, so the stock price is closely tied to the cyclicality of the bond market."
2021-06-15 18:56:03,wallstreetbets,GL to you too. I didn't mean for it to come off like I am trying to push you into the sector.
2021-06-15 18:10:52,wallstreetbets,"I hate every single shipline, rail company and port authority in the nation right now."
2021-06-15 17:39:23,wallstreetbets,"I will read anything that catches my eye. It's rare. Like marine shipping caught my eye. As about 8 or so months ago, I invested in AIRT for air freight as I saw the impending backlog of marine shipping. It worked out beautifully."
2021-06-15 17:40:51,wallstreetbets,"I figured you weren't. Just read what you said and all I could think was how every boomer (really everyone as they age I think) says things like that. Back in the good ole days. lol  anyways, I dont mean any offense"
2021-06-15 18:12:38,wallstreetbets,"lol, but you didnt say ship lease company. :)"
2021-06-15 17:43:39,wallstreetbets,Glad I caught your eye. I figured this would go over like a lead balloon. I didn't name companies because some are too small and others mean I would have to post a bunch of DD and then be called a shill.
2021-06-15 17:41:39,wallstreetbets,Oh I haven’t heard of that one yet I’ll have to take a look
2021-06-15 17:42:16,wallstreetbets,😂😂 good point it totally comes across that way lol but the good ol days were only 14 months ago 😂😂
2021-06-15 18:13:23,wallstreetbets,Anyone even remotely related right now too.
2021-06-15 19:22:28,wallstreetbets,See this is what I am curious about. You are going to look into something that you were not until this thread. I invested in DAC last year because I was reading an article about a different company that was related but I didnt know about DAC at the time. I would think all sectors that have potential would be discussed here as long as they were high return gamble. Which these to sectors fit this.
2021-06-15 17:58:48,wallstreetbets,"This is my first thread post here. So far it is going ......... yea not great. I figured it wouldn't. I am not into 1 or 2 week trades because it is way to short. But I had seen people say that they say as long as its a bet, having large % gain potential then they are interested in it. Oh well. this thread will be lost in no time. I had hoped some people could make money in a sector I believe in. (well at least specific companies)"
2021-06-15 18:00:05,wallstreetbets,"I do both long and short trades, this sub is primarily where I get my day trade picks from, I use r/stocks and r/investing for long term as the DD there is way more in-depth and factual"
2021-06-15 18:03:32,wallstreetbets,I have generally stayed over there. But overall not a big reddit user. Best of luck in your trades and investing
2021-06-15 18:14:58,wallstreetbets,You as well!

2021-06-15 18:32:49,wallstreetbets,"Why does any stock price go up? 

The cannabis industry is in its infancy and will grow considerably in the future. TLRY is one of the biggest cannabis companies in the world and continues acquiring other cannabis companies to increase market share. There is massive political and public support for full legalization of cannabis in the US which would open a huge market for TLRY to expand. TLRY will boost revenue greatly in a post Covid economy. 
The big reason the price of TLRY has remained low is due to low investor confidence in the cannabis industry as a whole. Once confidence starts to return the stock price will go up substantially and rather quickly"

2021-06-15 16:58:34,wallstreetbets,This is insanity 🤣🤣
2021-06-15 16:50:13,wallstreetbets,"If all yall keep seeing WISH, you best take some tendies to the seeing eye doctor before playing anymore stonk game."
2021-06-15 16:50:44,wallstreetbets,"I’m currently down %45 on most of my calls , IM NOT SELLING 🚀🚀"
2021-06-15 17:07:46,wallstreetbets,That's gonna leave a mark.
2021-06-15 17:23:49,wallstreetbets,"Failed, like the cricket service provider 🤔"
2021-06-15 17:42:46,wallstreetbets,You just broke WSBs retardedness gauge bro
2021-06-15 18:03:19,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, July is still a ways away"
2021-06-15 19:45:11,wallstreetbets,Yeah you're a failure.
2021-06-15 19:45:55,wallstreetbets,I brought bb and umc call options contracts for 7/16 is this the same kind of retard energy? Did i miss the mark for the moon?
2021-06-15 16:48:12,wallstreetbets,For the same reason why you saw WKHS spammed here continuously for the past 3 weeks.
2021-06-15 16:48:56,wallstreetbets,"Generally when options go up over 1000%+ in a short period of time. They will never retain that value no matter the stock movement. An example would be when amc’s $50 call went to $2500 when AMC first went to $50. Right now the June 18th call is worth $1100, but the stock price is back to 58. People need to understand IV levels"
2021-06-15 16:48:39,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-06-15 18:03:56,wallstreetbets,Bot it’s wkhs
2021-06-15 17:04:27,wallstreetbets,But he bought WKHS. 🤫🧐😐🤔
2021-06-15 16:58:55,wallstreetbets,"he's a genius because it didn't happen, but a real genuine super retarted if it does"
2021-06-15 17:54:56,wallstreetbets,It was 30 back in feb
2021-06-15 17:02:30,wallstreetbets,Well I want my American dream damnit! 😭😭😭😭
2021-06-15 17:37:01,wallstreetbets,Wait a minute...You're telling me I'm suppose to be looking at what I'm buying? I though we were just smashing buttons and hoping for tendies?
2021-06-15 18:04:39,wallstreetbets,I’m still in it brother
2021-06-15 19:48:45,wallstreetbets,Hopefully only for a couple weeks
2021-06-15 19:48:11,wallstreetbets,I haven’t looked at those dude good luck
2021-06-15 18:45:42,wallstreetbets,Number one killer of WSB. IV
2021-06-15 16:57:13,wallstreetbets,"That’s my point. if he was so concerned that it might go down or trade sideways, which is probably what he was thinking by buying further out, he should’ve just waited for IV to come down a lil and theta to do some work. If it had continued to run up even more, he just lost out on extra profits by not buying 6/18"
2021-06-15 16:51:10,wallstreetbets,Second photo is WISH
2021-06-15 18:10:24,wallstreetbets,2 pics
2021-06-15 19:00:18,wallstreetbets,Snot look at the two dots below.
2021-06-15 17:45:16,wallstreetbets,"The American dream is based on work, not I'll advised yolos."
2021-06-15 17:38:36,wallstreetbets,"Well, it appears I was the asshat who was totally oblivious to the concept of two screen shots in one post...
So, there is that."
2021-06-15 19:55:04,wallstreetbets,"Check out $12.5 strike for July 16 on $WISH. Contract actually looks very possible, plenty of time, reasonable price. Much more upside than negative. Noob."
2021-06-15 19:56:15,wallstreetbets,Im just curious if the shorts expire on the same time frame which would screw me over unless the volume traded increased which would save me
2021-06-15 19:00:32,wallstreetbets,👍🏻
2021-06-15 18:06:22,wallstreetbets,"Make that two asshats. I'm retarded though... So, there is that.

Edit: 3 asshats. I forgot OP who's down 29k making 40c on wish and wkhs."
2021-06-15 16:39:15,wallstreetbets,"Great, now you can go buy yourself some crayons with the rest of the money"
2021-06-15 16:39:51,wallstreetbets,Atleast you have another 10k to lose. Do it like me and make it 0$
2021-06-15 17:49:24,wallstreetbets,That is how an RMBK reactor explodes.
2021-06-15 16:40:38,wallstreetbets,So your stop loss was at -99%? Interesting.
2021-06-15 17:22:45,wallstreetbets,Time to go all in on GE since you sold. Got it! Thanks for your sacrifice!!
2021-06-15 19:29:24,wallstreetbets,"Volume on these calls was 9,148 for the day. Your sales were more than half of the entire market for these today."
2021-06-15 18:09:51,wallstreetbets,"The mods should sticky this for retards to see - it's worth 1000X more than the shit ""DD"" threads that get repeated every day on the front page about the latest 'meme' stock"
2021-06-15 16:44:01,wallstreetbets,No. The ticker was G “M” E… retard.
2021-06-15 18:18:25,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for this u/four1six_ 💦💦💦.  Just how I like it.

Now OP, tell me these were weeklies so I can finish."
2021-06-15 17:41:26,wallstreetbets,So this is what happens when options go the other way.

2021-06-15 17:48:46,wallstreetbets,Stupid question but how much did you actually lose? Like what was your initial investment?
2021-06-15 16:42:11,wallstreetbets,That’s rough buddy. Fingers crossed for better days soon.
2021-06-15 18:01:38,wallstreetbets,bookmarking this to come back on 6/18 and check GE
2021-06-15 16:48:37,wallstreetbets,The good news is you could have become rich and turned into a douche. Close one am I right?
2021-06-15 16:39:36,wallstreetbets,absolute mad lad
2021-06-15 18:42:46,wallstreetbets,So... ramen for the rest of the year?
2021-06-15 17:19:46,wallstreetbets,Are you one of those who rushed to buy GME but instead type GE. It happen to me with BB I bought BBY. Auto correction sucks.
2021-06-15 19:55:19,wallstreetbets,I will never buy options
2021-06-15 18:18:04,wallstreetbets,I'm looking at a fucking idiot.
2021-06-15 17:19:56,wallstreetbets,Margin or nah?
2021-06-15 16:40:39,wallstreetbets,"can't make bets if you have zero money, good job selling"
2021-06-15 16:56:56,wallstreetbets,Shitting GE ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|poop)
2021-06-15 17:37:21,wallstreetbets,Sorry for you bro. I understand how hard it must be for you. Fking option make you ultra rich or complete broke.
2021-06-15 19:07:44,wallstreetbets,"However, in the WSB books: 

The Master just spent $100K for training. Enjoy your tax break"
2021-06-15 19:45:09,wallstreetbets,"After reading his responses, OP literally did everything wrong. This is what happens when you try to get rich quick instead of using your brain."
2021-06-15 18:11:42,wallstreetbets,I literally have a $12/13 - $13/14 iron condor on $GE because the price never ever leaves $13 for long.

2021-06-15 17:03:56,wallstreetbets,Condolences 💐
2021-06-15 18:56:02,wallstreetbets,Can someone explain what just happened here and why this guy put some much money into ge? Was it supposed to go up in price or something ?
2021-06-15 19:10:03,wallstreetbets,[removed]
2021-06-15 16:49:14,wallstreetbets,You'll make it up. Let's find the next 1000% ticker
2021-06-15 16:43:20,wallstreetbets,Yikes! Hugs!
2021-06-15 16:49:46,wallstreetbets,The ride was fun I’m sure
2021-06-15 17:37:53,wallstreetbets,Awesome!! Loss porn. Exactly what this subreddit was a few months back. Better hope your wife doesn’t tell her boyfriend about this loss. Good luck on your next gamble.
2021-06-15 17:42:19,wallstreetbets,"This is some serious loss porn, thanks for the lesson and better luck next time."
2021-06-15 17:55:08,wallstreetbets,"You win some, you lose some. Hope you're able to make it up on the next trade."
2021-06-15 18:04:41,wallstreetbets,A for effort. Too bad you don’t at least get free popcorn 🍿
2021-06-15 18:08:18,wallstreetbets,Certified legit ape!!!
2021-06-15 18:08:26,wallstreetbets,You have enough left to make it all up. Just be patient and keep an eye out.

2021-06-15 18:50:07,wallstreetbets,Never bet on GE. That’s a fools errand.

2021-06-15 16:38:12,wallstreetbets,Yolo into AMC?
2021-06-15 17:26:07,wallstreetbets,Ugh I needed this
2021-06-15 17:42:18,wallstreetbets,"OP, just heard it was going to moon again on Friday, buy more calls!"
2021-06-15 18:40:15,wallstreetbets,This hurts me. Jesus Christ dude
2021-06-15 18:02:08,wallstreetbets,Why not hold to expiry and give yourself at least some chance?
2021-06-15 19:25:01,wallstreetbets,"Not financial advice, but after such a loss, I'd stay away from the market, and only come back when there's a huge dip in some stocks you like and most investors are bullish about (set alerts on your trading/charting app) and, you know, buy the dip (preferably with reasonable leverage using not too retarded calls). Meanwhile, just treat yourself well and forget about this shit."
2021-06-15 19:30:41,wallstreetbets,That’s what happens when you put $130k into robinhood
2021-06-15 16:46:05,wallstreetbets,"That's why smart apes set up an option strangle if it pops the calls make money, if it tanks the puts make money.  If it pops then drops you can make money on both"
2021-06-15 17:55:09,wallstreetbets,Damn sucks to suck
2021-06-15 19:18:41,wallstreetbets,"You are an absolute retard. But honestly keep your chin up and if you're going to invest again remember this loss so you can do it smarter.
Don't spiral and don't even think of starting a new game. 
 When GME pops to 500k I'll send you a little something."

2021-06-15 18:02:55,wallstreetbets,How much of your portfolio is this 97k?
2021-06-15 18:11:38,wallstreetbets,BTW when did you buy these?
2021-06-15 18:12:49,wallstreetbets,I love how they still have the Exercise there
2021-06-15 18:24:42,wallstreetbets,"Heyyyyy, you been copying my options trades lately or what?"

2021-06-15 18:33:56,wallstreetbets,Damn man I lost money on GE calls too but not like this.
2021-06-15 18:39:20,wallstreetbets,"This made my stomach flip, I’ll never have that much to lose, O wait, that’s about how much I still owe on student loans. Fml."
2021-06-15 18:43:56,wallstreetbets,Why would you do that?!?
2021-06-15 19:03:48,wallstreetbets,Look on the bright side. The IRS isn't getting any tendies on this one either
2021-06-15 19:04:49,wallstreetbets,Have you tried doing the opposite?
2021-06-15 19:12:17,wallstreetbets,"I can show you how to turn that 10k into zero, just let me know"
2021-06-15 19:13:44,wallstreetbets,Why sell now? You lost everything already
2021-06-15 19:21:37,wallstreetbets,"You're most likely fine, but imagine if some company announces some history making acquisition of GE this week.  

This tiny bit of possibility is what makes us hold from -99% to -100%."
2021-06-15 19:22:22,wallstreetbets,F
2021-06-15 19:28:39,wallstreetbets,Why stop at 10k… should have went all the way to 0…
2021-06-15 19:28:44,wallstreetbets,Jesus. Why on earth didn’t you sell sooner! Decay bro
2021-06-15 19:29:51,wallstreetbets,This will eventually be all the people Yoloing on FDs for meme stocks.

2021-06-15 19:43:22,wallstreetbets,Yolo on CVS 100c leaps and don't look at this shit for a year
2021-06-15 19:43:49,wallstreetbets,Just stick to MSFT calls! You know exactly how that stock acts I’ve seen you post wins a bunch of times from MSFT. You can turn that 10k into 50k this month.
2021-06-15 19:47:16,wallstreetbets,You still had a couple days till expiration to pray for a miracle
2021-06-15 19:48:38,wallstreetbets,"Probably what you get for fucking with GE, the dustiest stock"
2021-06-15 19:51:59,wallstreetbets,I did this with my bb calls and 2 weeks later they popped like crazy with the amc squeeze and I feel like dying now. Hope the same doesn’t happen to you.
2021-06-15 19:55:09,wallstreetbets,10k into GME. LAST CHANCE
2021-06-15 17:59:33,wallstreetbets,ge is 13 dollars a share not .03??
2021-06-15 19:11:34,wallstreetbets,"Let’s be real here, if you do the math you started with 112k. Now that’s still admirable, therefore you don’t have to massively round up to 130k to sound cool."
2021-06-15 18:11:06,wallstreetbets,Dude cmon!!! Have you done you TA ?
2021-06-15 18:24:13,wallstreetbets,Next move: yolo to BB with your last 10k. By EOM you will get your start money back
2021-06-15 18:28:13,wallstreetbets,Sorry for your loss... This is why I am not interested in options.
2021-06-15 19:24:00,wallstreetbets,First mistake was investing in a boomer stock.  Second mistake was selling and not letting it expire.. :p That's what a true ape would have done..

2021-06-15 17:03:30,wallstreetbets,The price doesn’t have to get to “breakeven” to make profit. That’s just representing the cost of what you would pay if you exercised for the shares plus premium*. As far as ape know
2021-06-15 17:52:41,wallstreetbets,$10k loan.
2021-06-15 16:49:13,wallstreetbets,Now I’m just a poor idiot. So I guess I win.
2021-06-15 17:17:16,wallstreetbets,In my eyes $130k already makey you kinda rich.

2021-06-15 16:56:03,wallstreetbets,Probably start day drinking. This is going to shit on my credit and probably lose my job. So answer is yes.
2021-06-15 19:01:15,wallstreetbets,"$GE was gearing to breakout of the pattern upwards after testing the highs. It looked like it was going to land around $15. So I made the bet. Originally with 1000c news kept pumping, 100 aircraft deal, then $7B debt payed off, then I got wind of an announcement on June 14th from aviation. The price target was supported by analysts so I sent it and doubled down on my loss. Little did I know that yahoo pumped an article on why hedge funds stopped buying $GE just some bullshit FUD so sell offs continued. On Monday $GE announced a joint venture with Safran with a new engine model that would reduce carbon output and China announced talks to recert the 737 MAX. The CPI numbers didn’t look terrible but it was a miss so it continued to drop. After a week of great news the stock price dropped 7% and broke the retry to breakout. So I lost the bet. PPI numbers came out a miss but it recovered today and got me enough interest to sell today at a 97% loss."
2021-06-15 16:50:18,wallstreetbets,"Nah, I’m done with investing for a while."
2021-06-15 16:51:34,wallstreetbets,"It was. Somehow lost $60k in a day. So that was fun. Then it slowly dropped to $14k and now I was forced to sell to keep some money, but couldn’t liquidate above $0.02 some sold for $0.01."

2021-06-15 19:52:51,wallstreetbets,I already have that feeling.
2021-06-15 19:22:28,wallstreetbets,It was worth $130k at some point.
2021-06-15 18:16:23,wallstreetbets,Yes. A lot. Breakout to higher level was likely specially after the 100 aircraft order and the new engine model.

Do everything in your power to keep your job and spirits high, money isn't happiness, how we prove to ourselves we can overcome adversity while we are here is.

2021-06-15 18:02:41,wallstreetbets,Bro you lost your money in 6 days on options that's not investing that's gambling. You're done with gambling for a while.

2021-06-15 18:27:09,wallstreetbets,Why didnt you sell when that hit 14.40$ then??
2021-06-15 18:57:39,wallstreetbets,Only when you sell them. You can’t actually hold them yourself.
2021-06-15 16:53:35,wallstreetbets,"Idk, it feels almost unreal to think how fast it all went. Literally only took 6 days."
2021-06-15 17:29:35,wallstreetbets,Viac sucks. I have been chasing 55 since bill hwang went broke. Lost about 30k on AI and VIAC since.
2021-06-15 17:50:38,wallstreetbets,Ok well that’s what I said in different words. It’s the premium (.23 a share) plus $14
2021-06-15 17:47:09,wallstreetbets,"I just need a day. Or two. I’ll be fine. First time I had life changing money, first I lost life changing money. Biggest loss is losing the hope of possibilities and a better financial future."
2021-06-15 17:43:34,wallstreetbets,Because not all the money was mine and if I can’t pay my debts it’ll affect the credit. My job requires a clearance. If it negatively affects my credit I will lose my job.
2021-06-15 16:40:39,wallstreetbets,Uhhhhhh👍🏼
2021-06-15 18:34:23,wallstreetbets,Because I bought after. Thinking it was just retracing and going to retry the breakout.
2021-06-15 19:49:56,wallstreetbets,Oh I get it now.
2021-06-15 17:14:24,wallstreetbets,For me my life savings of 31000$ went in under a day. I needed a few weeks to realize how fucked up that was.
2021-06-15 18:07:27,wallstreetbets,"Well you gambled and you lost. I know these situations when you re exhausted, can't even think clearly cuz you were staring hours the charts. Next time start with a solid portfolio, never buy on margin or credit and come back after you re clear in your head. Hope there were some gains in the 130k? Well in the end it's just money, printed paper or digital 1s and zeros. As long as you don't need it for living its okay. Grab something good to eat(some deluxe dinner is cheap compared to this) and a cold Coke. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|hug)"

2021-06-15 18:11:59,wallstreetbets,No it was part of my collapse.
2021-06-15 18:22:16,wallstreetbets,But this is still a total assreaming though right?
2021-06-15 18:55:15,wallstreetbets,Thanks. Now you know.
2021-06-15 19:05:59,wallstreetbets,So I shouldn’t have sold? If this goes in the money I’m hanging myself with the bag

2021-06-15 16:50:17,wallstreetbets,"I listened to the webcast they had this morning at market open. Great CEO and team. Super bullish, they are killing it. I’m happy to hold for the long term, picked up 100 shares at $22.8 and am sitting on 9/17 $25C I bought at the same time. 

Can’t believe no attention has been paid to the conference call/ webcast this morning as it was very well put together and tells me great thing are in store for WOOF."
2021-06-15 19:48:35,wallstreetbets,Underrated comment
2021-06-15 16:48:24,wallstreetbets,"No, I've been waiting for an opportunity to dump these bags for almost 6 months. Yesterday was my window, then I figured ""Hmm, lemme see what's going on instead of just clicking buttons"". Came on here, because I don't trust any of the fake news that's everywhere, and I saw all this chatter on how it's ""muh next squeeze"", then I thought, ""Woah! Next squeeze?? I don't wanna paper hands this""... Will it squeeze still? Today was kind of a weird day. Hopefully tomorrow they let the dogs out again $WOOF. I don't even care about the money at this point tbh, it's pretty stable, seems like a good stock, and I'm still green on it from selling $30c's for months... but Cramer can't get away with this."
2021-06-15 16:52:35,wallstreetbets,You people need to spend less time grubbing through YAHOO stock tickers and get real brokers with full after hours and premarket views. Woof peaked at 29.5 yesterday and was on a steady grind down all the way to open for nearly four hours of trading between after hours and premarket. The reason you think the meme plays are weird is because you miss the activity that causes the gap ups and downs.
2021-06-15 16:53:05,wallstreetbets,"IDK man. I saw some TA cuck analyze $WOOF and talk about derivatives and how it was pushed back up to $30 by algos, and according to his meme lines and other memetrics it would take 6 months before $woof sees $30 again. 6 months? I mean I can continue to sell covered calls on it for peanuts but everyones gonna be eating premium tendies with all their riches from cow fart stock $CLNE while I watch this dog $WOOF just continue to crab."
2021-06-15 16:55:49,wallstreetbets,"Yeah $CHWY said their sales have been getting gobbled up recently by retail, that means $WOOF. Plus their vets, grooming, & all the other services they offer that you can't get through an app. IDK, looks good for $woof but it just crabs because the damn SI. I thought it could be a good candidate for a squeeze but it's a dog.... $WOOF."
2021-06-15 17:46:37,wallstreetbets,I yoloed my whole profile in this bitch was up big RAN OUT OF DAY TRADES LIKE AN IDIOT and couldn’t see my calls or shares after hours spanked my ass raw and I’m currently down big 😂😭👍

2021-06-15 16:55:28,wallstreetbets,"* They specifically say that SBTech was bought for its kick ass tech that DKNG itself wasn't able to develop.
* Most of the issues cited by Hindenburg relate to non-US gaming; DKNG is exposed to illegal gambling in Indonesia and Vietnam, as well as US trade sanctions due to money laundering in Iran, and banking regulations related to anti-money laundering rules from ties to Asian Triads.

Seems like the only bias going on in reddit are a bunch of people who suddenly saw their 50c monthlies and weeklies drop to OTM, on a stock that's been in a negative channel for weeks."

2021-06-15 17:46:16,wallstreetbets,"Yes and averaging down. Will sell CCs if needed until it gets attention. 40% short is a good enough reason to buy it. For me it’s a trade on a squeeze play, not a long term investment. Although those who are going long could do worse."
2021-06-15 17:53:36,wallstreetbets,"If UWMC got even a fraction of the attention and volume CLOV got it would blow through the roof instantly.

It's the perfect storm waiting to happen but it doesn't have a stupid meme or emoji to go along with its ticker so nobody seems to care."

2021-06-15 16:31:41,wallstreetbets,"Hey, finance majors are awesome! I was a history major but studying the CFA helped brief me up on the lingo. 

I can try but this is just raw data. I would need to know what your positions are to properly interpret what the data could mean to you. For example if 200,000 calls were sold on AMC while only 20,000 puts were sold, and all of them went at the ask price, then that means people are probobly fomoing into the stock and driving the price up artificially. Or it could mean that ""smart"" money is entering into the asset quietly. You should always look up 13F forms to verify the whale's positions. 

Here is a nice tool to do just that!

If AMC or gme can win and they have been winning for months now,  it could help bring attention to naked shorting and malpractice is in the stock market. It could also help prevent the volatility of these pump and dumps these hedge funds start then finish with naked shorting"

I only had a month or so before heading back to university so I tried a few different plays but ended up going with the company I knew the most about and put all of it on ATVI @ $13.7 (I played all of blizzards games at the time like WOW/Diablo and MW2. About a year ago my Dad mentioned in a phone call that he had something he wanted to bring up and said he was sorry 😞,  he sold out of ATVI a few weeks after I went back to university and he has been kicking himself for years watching that stock climb up to over $80. I didn't really feel that bad about it since it was his money to begin with but ya I agree, kids can have insights that we may not. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|shrug)"

2021-06-15 16:59:55,wallstreetbets,"Except your dad was right. Amazon as a book and Internet retail company traded like dog shit for the better part of a decade because of some of the things he cited. The only reason they're hot shit today is because Bezos got tired of sitting in capital planning meetings for deciding on budgets for data centers, and gave a blank check to people to build as much capacity as they needed. Only issue is they needed to figure out some way to monetize the massive amounts of capacity they developed, and AWS was born.  


Turns out renting computers and data center infrastructure to fuckwits in corporate who are sick of paying 6-figures for semi-qualified engineers is a lucrative business."
2021-06-15 16:35:40,wallstreetbets,Can confirm. Parents were paranoid af about buying anything online in the early 2000's. They didn't come around to online shopping until around 15 years later.
2021-06-15 16:58:44,wallstreetbets,Amazon was one that made it. There were also a lot that fared worse than Kodak. Books a million? Fog dog?  A bunch went bankrupt for every Amazon. Point is diversify.
2021-06-15 16:29:54,wallstreetbets,"The biggest winner in my portfolio right now is $PLAY. I bought it about a year ago at $15. Currently trading around $45. I bought it because I asked my kid to pick a stock as a little learn to invest project for him. I wish I had taken an even bigger position in it now! I should just have my kid pick all my stocks now.

Edit: he was debating between $PLAY and $RACE. Clearly picking D&B was the big winner, but even if he had gone with Ferrari he'd still be up 10%+ now."

Not sure what he did put it in, but I’m sure it isn’t worth anywhere near what that Google stock would be worth today."

I invested everything I could afford, he doubled down. I could only afford 5 shares. But buying at $5 and selling at $150, pretty fucking good return.

2019 - Founder of ""In-Charge"" - No clue anything about this company

2017-2018 - VP of ""Workhorse Group"" - well they are on the path to bankruptcy...

2011-2015 - Chief Marketing Officer and Head of Business Development and Government Affairs for ""Smith Electric Vehicles"" - Well that company founded in 1920 closed its doors in Feb 2017.

Financials aren't as great as say Southwest, but Delta got hit harder than rest of peers recently. It's currently trading at lower end of oscillations and I think downside is minimal from here in medium-term. Upside nice given how rapidly covid is dropping in recent weeks and pent-up travel demand.

2021-06-15 19:45:04,wallstreetbets,"Let me tell you guys a story as an old friend coiner and how mania gets people caught up and ignoring common sense and why you shouldn’t let fomo drive you. Back in the late 2010’s there was a prominent altcorn that was running up 100’s of percents day over day with no use. Then all of a sudden they released news that they were developing a use for it that you could rent bikes for public transportation with the corns as a payment method. It ran and ran and ran thousands of percent totally parabolic. To this day there never was any bikes nor would the bikes ever be of value let alone warrant billions of market cap yet people lost millions on the idea you could at some point in the future potentially rent bikes in China with these special corns. 

Be very cautious as we broach new highs daily on the indexes common sense is easily discarded when everyone is greedy. Take a look around people are buying dead companies in hopes they can make a quick buck in a get rich quick scheme. This is a marathon not a sprint. SPY 420P 6/23"

I'm adding here. 1250 shares. This is building up and the pressure is on the shorts who are paying extra to borrow even more shares. Time is on the side of the longs and so is the Infrastructure trillions.

Aside from today being a total dump I have doubled my account in 2 months doing this. Now would I have done this with GME when I made that play??  No but that was my YOLO this year.

2021-06-15 18:14:52,wallstreetbets,Not sure what transformation they've made. Other than to close 20% of their remaining stores this year. They would be smart to push more e-commerce but candles/lotions are already massively competitive in the online space.

2021-06-15 15:48:41,wallstreetbets,"It's overshorted because 32% of the float belongs to short-sellers right now. That's the highest in the industry, and higher than the % for most shorted stonks currently trending on WSB.

It went from $27 to $44 in one day because the shorts got squeezed after getting too greedy: then they drove the price back down. That was proof of concept, just like when GME flew to $493, then back down to $38, and then up again. I'm not posting about some arcane Babylonian math here hahaha

Their debt is $3 billion - not ideal, but manageable.

Inflation FUD is not tanking other stonks by 40%.

I never said ""short ladder"" (cute capitalization, btw) - I pointed out 2 trading days within the last week, where each day saw a 9% drop. That happened on zero news. There is no other plausible explanation aside from a short-seller attack - and the recent spike to $44 is just another piece of proof that there are short-sellers, and that they're heavily involved in BBBY.

&#x200B;

Like I said, I didn't post this to set off some pump & dump - if you don't want to buy BBBY, so be it. I'm not their spokesperson - just an enthusiastic ape. If you want more answers, do your own research. Cheers."

They renovated some of the remaining stores while foot traffic was low to increase sales (Mark Tritton was Chief Merchandising Officer at Target which is known for this exact strategy)

They have hand selected leadership decided by CEO/President Mark Tritton

They are focusing on the omni-channel strategy and making large strides (Omnichannel winners and regarding online penetration in industry ""BBY logged the biggest leap in online penetration growth YOY at 43% in 2020 vs. 19% in 2019, followed by BBBY (38% vs. 17%)"")

They are also making the online experience better and easier to spend $$$ (Regarding checkout efficiency (clicks) ""BBBY made huge strides, going from 6 to 3 YOY"" and ""These included much faster load times (7 seconds to 1.5 seconds)""

They have also massively stepped up BOPIS and delivery ""BBBY now has same-day delivery through a combination of Shipt and Instacart marketplaces.

2021-06-15 19:29:11,wallstreetbets,"Well said. Personally I wont touch anything still in brick and mortar retail space, specifically at the rate which malls are closing down, but you make a strong case. It definitely seems worth looking deeper into the financials for."
2021-06-15 19:29:51,wallstreetbets,"BBBY in the city was packed this weekend.

Their online penetration has increased YoY  and they are omnichannel focused now.

""BBY logged the biggest leap in online penetration growth YOY at 43% in 2020 vs. 19% in 2019, followed by BBBY (38% vs. 17%)""

They shut down 20% of their stores because they weren't profitable, and used the covid low traffic to remodel some of their stores to increase sales. Mark Tritton was Chief Merchandising Officer at Target which is known for the same move.

 But don't listen to me, listen to the man himself: [https://www.npd.com/wps/portal/npd/us/news/videos/a-fireside-chat-with-mark-tritton-president-and-ceo-of-bed-bath-and-beyond/](https://www.npd.com/wps/portal/npd/us/news/videos/a-fireside-chat-with-mark-tritton-president-and-ceo-of-bed-bath-and-beyond/)"
2021-06-15 19:09:03,wallstreetbets,"""they’ve definitely gotten less popular and competitive""

wrong af but ok

\-Omnichannel winners and regarding online penetration in industry ""BBY logged the biggest leap in online penetration growth YOY at 43% in 2020 vs. 19% in 2019, followed by BBBY (38% vs. 17%)""

\-Regarding checkout efficiency (clicks)  ""BBBY made huge strides, going from 6 to 3 YOY"" and ""These included much faster load times (7 seconds to 1.5 seconds)""

\-Regarding delivery ""BBBY now has same-day delivery through a combination of Shipt and Instacart marketplaces. Additionally, through DoorDash Drive, BBBY and buybuy Baby websites will expand same-day delivery to over 3,000 additional zip codes across the country. With the added coverage, same day delivery is now available in 99% of their store locations. ""

\-New leadership ""CEO Steven Temares resigned shortly thereafter (May 2019) andBBBY named Mark Tritton as CEO in October 2019. Mark was previously ChiefMerchandising Officer at TGT and brings a powerful resume of private labelleadership (which was one of the opportunities identified by the activists) and was akey figure in TGT’s e-commerce turnaround. In his first six months on the job, Markcompletely overhauled the BBBY management team, making the followingappointments: Gustavo Arnal as CFO, John Hartmann as COO and President ofbuybuy BABY, Joe Hartsig as Chief Merchandising Officer and President ofHarmon, Gregg Melnick as Chief Stores Officer, Rafeh Masood as Chief DigitalOfficer, Cindy Davis as Chief Brand Officer and President of Decorist, and ArleneHong as Chief Legal Officer.""

\-Closed many unprofitable locations (20%), and remodeled other locations while foot traffic was low.

\-Got rid of many unprofitable brands.

\-Is focusing on and has begun to release their own vertically integrated brands which in turn will increase margin.

\-Over 2.5% insider ownership (CFO just bought 500k USD of shares in April at \~25 dollars a share to add to his 300,00 shares).

\-Over 98.5% institutional ownership (Yes those add up to more than 100%).

\-They often do share buybacks.

\-They had a dividend but removed it due to covid.

\-Earnings report estimate July.

Other potential catalyst:

Last year college Freshman weren't able to go to school in many cases, so this year it might be a special year where both Freshman and Sophomores are all purchasing ""new"" stuff for back to school.

Potential summer/fall baby boom for their brand Buy Buy Baby [https://labblog.uofmhealth.org/rounds/researchers-predict-covid-baby-boom](https://labblog.uofmhealth.org/rounds/researchers-predict-covid-baby-boom)"
2021-06-15 19:53:01,wallstreetbets,"Brick and Mortar still make up the bulk of retail sales. I’m pretty sure the CEO is using the same playbook he used for Target, and I don’t know anyone that questions Target’s viability. I think he’s going to remodel the stores to make them more of an experience and move towards selling exclusive brands thereby creating a moat which has been BBBY’s biggest problem."
2021-06-15 19:21:06,wallstreetbets,"I mean nothing you said is even convincing that they’re a leader in their space, just that they might be making some improvements to a brick and mortar company. I mean just do a sanity check, you ever been to a bbby? Shit is pretty dead compared to what it was back then. Anything I need for bbby I just get from amazon or other stores. Same for most people. Younger generation, zoomers and millennials, probably prefer getting the shit bbby sells from target. Bbby market share is the elderly and stay at home moms who have nothing else to do"
2021-06-15 19:29:37,wallstreetbets,"Do you think BBBY’s attempt to sell its own branded products won’t work? Do you or someone you know ever shop at Target? Same guy who led Target’s marketing campaign is now in charge of BBBY. I don’t think anyone is say that this stock is going to be the next Amazon, but rather the stock is undervalued at the current price."
2021-06-15 19:35:32,wallstreetbets,"I don't disagree with you (I'm a 30-something male ape who only buys new sheets once every 3 years hahaha), but

a) suburbanites looove themselves some bed and bath (and occasionally beyond) shopping, and

b) BBBY's new activist management scrapped the dead weight brands and set up in-house brands that by definition can't be resold on Amazon, and

c) revenge spending FTW. With the entire world being closed for over a year, and with everyone having to buy crap on Amazon (where you can't really feel the fabric, etc), I think there's a lot of people out there who will hit up brick&mortar stores. Here in Toronto, they've just reopened brick&mortar shopping after a 3-month lockdown. There's a Walmart near my house, and the parking lot is jammed full 24/7, it's insane. O\_o I don't have a BBBY near me, but I imagine it's similar with all the big stores right now.

Aaaanyway haha, the point of this DD isn't to make y'all fall in love with BBBY. It's to show that BBBY is a fundamentally stronk company that can survive on its own, and that also has humongous % of its float shorted. It spiked up on 6/02 like all the other meme stonks, it got shorted after that like all the other meme stonks (non-meme stonks did not lose 20-40% of their value in the last 2 weeks), so you know what they say - if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's probably not a platypus. :P"
2021-06-15 19:25:06,wallstreetbets,"If they were already the leader, this would be less of an opportunity.

BBBY in NYC was crazy af this past weekend, so yes.

Did you not see the part about online penetration?

Did you not see the part about new leadership that has a track record for success?

Are you looking for opportunities before they become ripe? or do you want brown bananas?"
2021-06-15 19:36:11,wallstreetbets,"Who knows, but I just think I’d probably get a better return even on SPY than hoping their own branded shit is gonna bring in massive sales and drive customers towards them"
2021-06-15 19:31:03,wallstreetbets,"Whatever you say bud. I dont know how they’re going to take the market share from amazon and the other more chic retail stores, but good luck. And yeah 38% online penetration growth, wow, great. Probably because covid hit, so they got more online sales when they had to close stores.  Lets see how that number moves for the next 2-3 years. There’s just too much competition and not many ways to improve, but who knows, maybe I’m dumb and so are the big firms that short it. To me, the price action is meme’d and not organic as of late. Purely a squeeze gamble play, not value."
2021-06-15 19:41:37,wallstreetbets,I believe that’s why this sub is called wallstreetbets… emphasis on bets. Investment theory would tell you your best course of action is to only invest in a S&P 500 ETF.

2021-06-15 16:02:50,wallstreetbets,"The fact that you’re so blind that you can’t tell there is an infinite number of differentiating opinions in the world, that you believe every single person needs to be 100% on board with the ideas from an environment where you literally cannot talk about any other idea or opposing opinion, even to the point where you are calling sentient beings “bots,” referring to them as mindless algorithms, is the most absolute ironic thought process in the history of the world.

If you, and I guess, “your buddies,” we’re to be judged the same way that that you judge others, there would be without any reasonable doubt that you are in fact.. a “bot.”

Each one of you spew the same exact shit on every post you come into contact with. If anyone were to step back and analyze comments made by the majority, compared to AMC comments, they would come to the conclusion that there is actually some sort of force causing the same thought process or commenting algorithm in each AMC comment. Almost as if you, good sir, are a paid shill by some hedge fund benefiting from the raise in price. Whether it be they are long, or want some other institution to go under so that they make pick up their assets on a fire sale. 

Me, do I believe that you are a paid shill, or a bot? No. I’ve seen sheep. And I know them when I see them. You sir, are a sheep. Not even a retard. Just a mindless sheep.

Say commodities get squeezed, then inflation looks even worse and if it all crashes, then retail gets blamed. Great idea... I’ll pass. Frankly it’s better just to not listen to CNBC news. They know the inflation is transitory, but they need the FUD to help their game of chicken with the FED to try and make more money.

That said…do you know who this guy is? If not…do a quick search. TLDR: he’s one of the greatest investors of all time.

This guy already has billions…he really doesn’t need to talk his book.

Bottom line, he’s just stating the obvious…If the Fed still claims inflation is transitory/no big deal and keeps $120B/month in asset purchases like we’re in some sort of financial crisis…when there’s no financial crisis…and, inflation is the crisis.

Ignore inflation for too long and something in the system is gonna break. 

We’re in an 18 wheeler doing 100MPH down a steep hill heading for a 20MPH hairpin curve…we can:
- Tap the breaks (start raising rates) 1 mile before the turn…slow and steady rate increases.

- Wait until 1/8 mile before the turn and SLAM the breaks…huge/emergency rate increases.

2021-06-15 18:25:11,wallstreetbets,"Not OP, but I am a bit confused here.  You referenced the massive money printing, but think inflation is leveling off?  Don't expect it to be linear increases.  There will be pullbacks, perhaps even on a monthly basis.  But I think prices have to adjust to match what was printed and I don't think we're close to there yet.  Some markets like lumber may have peaked, but other markets haven't been affected yet.

Price increases are still working through the pipeline and wages will follow causing another round of price increases.

Also, watch some of the other markets.  Logistics is insane, especially cargo ships.  Computer chips are in shortage for the next year, maybe more.  Vehicles are in shortage.

I'd also caution against putting too much stock in the CPI.  It's probably a decent indicator, but it has a lot of flaws."

I'd tread carefully.

But I went back into Clov as well. Already dropped 70k. Have 40k left of ammo.

Godspeed!"

2021-06-15 18:00:50,wallstreetbets,CLOV is the only ticker that - let’s say “at least” because we’re all basically autistic here - has a future in this entire forum... For some reason we all would rather not get on board and make money together. Instead everyone cheers for each other to lose

2021-06-15 19:43:55,wallstreetbets,I’m rooting for CLOV as well but it’s hard to ignore the LARGE number of bots spamming. It’s a little worrisome
2021-06-15 16:53:08,wallstreetbets,See you at the welfare office soon
2021-06-15 19:55:25,wallstreetbets,You will be fucked of risk review your position and the concentration rule. They could force you to sell and cover.
2021-06-15 16:41:14,wallstreetbets,"CLOV is a pump and dump - have fun with that as it bleed down to below 12 over the next couple weeks. If you don't think it's a pump and dump, ask all the bagholders it made last week, they should confirm it for you."

2021-06-15 17:15:53,wallstreetbets,It’s all game theory these stocks. This is a fucking casino. Do you think you’re Warren buffet or something? Plenty of upside in CLOV on the numbers it’s not even hard to see if you have a small amount of experience and look at publicly available info.
2021-06-15 17:17:43,wallstreetbets,All of these are pump and dump schemes. If you think there’s a fundamental reason for all these meme stocks rising so much then you’re a little bit slow

2021-06-15 15:53:11,wallstreetbets,That $15 resistance point is insane. Lots of calls expiring this Friday and you can tell it’s a battle to keep it below

Long term you might be okay."
2021-06-15 18:43:24,wallstreetbets,I need it at $6 or $5 to enter also a low float in shares any positive news will rip this sucker to the moon..

I posted a SS of 200 calls which I sold literally the next day for $7k gain which went right back into shares. I'm sure there are a lot of retards who thought oh this guy bought calls I should buy some too, that's not how it works. Assume everyone here has 2 brain cells. 

On UWMC, it doesn't move, you'll see a lot of bullshit about gamma squeeze, Russell inclusion pop, shorts blah blah. Ignore it. All bullshit. The only thing that matters is what JPow says tomorrow and the market's reaction to that. Past that, if you own shares, sell OTM calls and accumulate if you believe in the company."

They should scrap the whole hub motor thing, but that would be admitting that all they did is worthless and would tank the stock.

Lordstown Motors $RIDE 6/15 Interview with Automotive Press Association.Featured Interim CEO, President, and VP of Engineering

Regarding Production:“September production has been confirmed. We will produce 20,000-25,000 vehicles by May 2022.”

Regarding pre-orders:“Currently, we have enough orders for production in 2021 and 2022. These are firm orders and were re-confirmed in the past 2 weeks.”

Regarding funding:“Currently we have enough funds to get us into production into May of 2022. We have well over $400m in the bank. We are actively talking to GM and other strategic investors as well.”

Regarding employees:We have about 600 employees and will be hiring several hundred more in the next 2-4 months.

Regarding differentiating from Ford and other competitors:Other OEM’s require lots of maintenance and have many longer term issues. Ford’s F150 lightning runs from $40,000 to $90,000. Generally, OEMs target the luxury market first. We are laser focused on our $55,000 Endurance that will cost fleet customers $47,000 after tax credits.Direct motors and simplicity make us different. Fleet operators want new technology and the Endurance will provide the lowest total cost of ownership for those fleet operators. We are actively having conversations with those fleet operators and providing them with a truck that fits their long term needs. We are laser focused on commercial fleets right now."
2021-06-15 14:49:02,wallstreetbets,"It was a call with the new chairwoman.

2021-06-15 14:53:59,wallstreetbets,If that was the “real” news… why would a CEO and Founder who owns (500 million $ 25%) say they won’t survive and quit?  He doesn’t want his name on the turd.  He will liquidate his options in Oct.
2021-06-15 14:50:46,wallstreetbets,It’s hilarious… forget the CEO who had the largest stake to lose saying the company was dead and resigned.  If you own 25% of a 2 billion company.  You don’t quit if there’s any remote chance for success.  Think about it.

We require additional capital to implement our business plan (the plan to produce the Endurance at a commercial scale), and it may (meaning hypothetical or possible situation) not be available on acceptable terms (they might want to bend ua over a barrel), if at all (we don't have it yet, so yeah maybe everyone will say no) creating substantial doubt (term of art the substantial means that it is the result of real events or conditions i.e. they have substance) as to our ability to continue as a going concern.


Where in the ever living fuck does it say, we asked, everyone said no, we're not getting a loan?  Or even that it's bloody fucking unlikely we're getting a loan.  Which is what you fucking claimed it said. It doesn't.  But now I know why FUD works.  Because of fucking morons like you, who can't even read the fucking language."

Nothing requires the company to be good *right now*. What it needs is a turnaround catalyst so that the expectation is the company will be good *in the future*. 

Presumably if a company was good *right now* short sellers wouldn't have shorted it to oblivion.

Lordstown has nothing but challenges ahead of it. And stiff competition from the big 3."
2021-06-15 14:47:45,wallstreetbets,"Their finnancials didn't suck tho, they had a good balance sheet along with other good factors, RIDE has none of that."
2021-06-15 17:34:31,wallstreetbets,"Because that is not a normal way to phase that, the normal way is to say we require capital and plan to borrow in order to finance the following things.

If the main dude says they are going down and resigns, this tells me this is the boards attempt to fund the company with new hype.  With WSB and shorts, it may actually work."
2021-06-15 17:24:10,wallstreetbets,"Bad DD?

Short squeezes need:

1) beaten down stock 2) short float over 30% and 3) impending catalysts

GOEV, WKHS, RIDE have all three. They will all have massive run-ups sooner or later, take note of prices today and you'll see how wrong you were."
2021-06-15 16:42:06,wallstreetbets,"but it really doesn't have to be a squeeze for a 30% short interest to affect the SP positively when they're finally covered, especially if there's substantial good news pushing the price up naturally and renewed confidence in management prompting some tutes to pile in or double up.  I'd be just fine seeing it back to 16-17.  I'm not like you 'big rollers' that sneers at a mere 50% profit from here i guess."

That's what I'm saying. A company needs to suck to be shorted because it needs short interest!!! No sucking = not much short interest!

But yes, its future is rocky."

2021-06-15 15:08:58,wallstreetbets,"you're not reading for comprehension

the people who resigned were not on the call."
2021-06-15 15:11:39,wallstreetbets,it was always promoted as 'limited production' in 2021.  the goal was 2000 units in '21 ramping up to 20k+ in '22.  FULL production was based on how many trucks they thought they could max out at given the facility's history with GM and the highest estimate of that i saw was 60k trucks per year.
2021-06-15 15:46:04,wallstreetbets,"there's a big difference between resigning because they think the company is failing somehow and being forced to resign because the board of directors thinks you're driving the company into a ditch.

why are you trying to equate the two?"

2021-06-15 15:14:42,wallstreetbets,"What GM did there, and what a brand new startup can do is like saying I can run as fast as Usain Bolt. Because I also run."
2021-06-15 15:27:51,wallstreetbets,"the claims that i think you're referring to (trying to give you  a non-flip answer) are the the 100k pre-orders?  if that's the case, the answer is that they created a means to actually sign up with a deposit required like other EV manufactures, and a (legally) clear intent to purchase instead of what was previously market research to gauge sentiment and *potential* orders.  That is what is being reported now as filling their order capacity through '22.

that answer your question?"
2021-06-15 15:38:03,wallstreetbets,"golly you're hard to teach.  i bet ""if a=b and b=c then a=c "" throws you for a loop.

year 1 - 2000

year 2 - 20,000 by **MAY 22** (so more by EOY)

year 3 depends on influx of capital to pay for all the tooling they need to max out

but doing the math $57,000 (per truck) X 20,000 (units produced) = $1,140,000,000.  Thats a billion with a **B**"
2021-06-15 16:19:05,wallstreetbets,🤣🤣🤣  They dont even have Beta trucks for crash testing yet. But sure. They are gonna roll 20k trucks out of Lordstown next year. Thats a nice daydream. Even if RIDE secures funding. And manages to survive. There is zero chance they roll 20k trucks out next yeat.
2021-06-15 17:50:59,wallstreetbets,"Are you just purposely saying things that aren’t true? There’s literal videos o the crash testing on their website. Lol again, not trying to convince you, but you’re saying things that are so outlandish that I can’t not say anything. There is entry to be concerned about with this company, but the things you’re saying just aren’t even true! They’ve made a lot of mistakes, sure. It’s risky as hell, I get that. I’ve been in since March, all the ups and downs and sure, I still get a little nervous on some of these dips, but I’m either fully retarted, or my nuts are just too damn big to let me sell!"
2021-06-15 18:48:28,wallstreetbets,"The company has begun some testing. But not final validation. Because that requires beta vehicles. Wich have not been produced to this point. Only hand built prototypes. PPVs have the battery packs, hub motors built in-house as well as paint, sub-assemblies, frames all completed in our plant,” Rich Schmidt, Lordstown Motor Corp. president, said. “As we complete PPVs, some will be heading to conduct their crash and engineering validations by the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA) in late summer as one of the final steps for production.”  https://www.vindy.com/news/business-news/2021/05/endurance-passes-front-and-side-pole-crash-tests/"

2021-06-15 18:56:13,wallstreetbets,"I'm from Ohio. I really hope they survive and prosper. The area desperately needs it. But feelings aside. I think they are shady as fuck, and were used as a means to an end by GM. I also think the despedate attempt to latch onto the ""light commercial niche"" is a bad play. Luxury trucks far outsell light commercial, with higher profit margins. And don't take into account the extremely conservative nature of small business owners. And previously existing sales and service relationships that have been built over decades in some cases. Charging Infrastructure,  and ability to receive maintenance are big drawbacks to something like the RIDE truck. And big bonuses to the new F150."

2021-06-15 19:27:24,wallstreetbets,"Someone has been keeping $ARVL below $20 for months.  Stock didn't even participate in the recent EV stock rally last week and the week before when every single EV stock went to the moon.

Whoever is short and manipulating it so it stayed below $20 is going to get his head ripped off.  A clear break out above $21.27 - $22 level should propel this stock for at least 2 or 3 days upward to hopefully $30+.

Huge short interest, massive short borrow rate, and thinly traded stock - all of these 3 factors make Arrival a perfect storm for a massive GAMMA SQUEEZE.

Perhaps we can see $50 by end of this week!  

As a long time shareholder in $ARVL, I hope people finally realize the massive potential of this EV maker.  Screw the $WKHS delivery vans....$ARVL deliver vans are 1000x better.  And imagine how much money they will make with their EV buses!

Long and strong this UK EV maker with tons of potential to be a massive player in the EV market."

This is a little over my head, but it does seem like the fails-to-deliver are awkwardly high. 1.1 million shares a day is a lot.

Fintel lists the Put/Call ratio at .26 though - so what's the real impact of this short attack if there's 75% more CALLS than PUTS?

I agree it seems weird, but I'm not convinced it's artificially holding the price down.. if someone were to stop doing this, would the price go up? All depends on if those 1M shares not being delivered are covered or not.

Either way the stock does seem worth a shot with or without the short."

2021-06-15 17:08:58,wallstreetbets,When does the share lockup expire?
2021-06-15 17:16:05,wallstreetbets,This is going to pop off
2021-06-15 17:28:53,wallstreetbets,Fuck yeah
2021-06-15 17:46:00,wallstreetbets,Just bought 100 shares to keep it on my radar.

2021-06-15 17:53:15,wallstreetbets,"Everyday  10,000 to 15,000 ITM ( in the money) call options have been purchased in the **morning** and they appear to be **exercised** in the afternoon of the **same day.**

Why would someone do that as opposed to buying the shares directly?"

2021-06-15 16:22:47,wallstreetbets,"The Jan 23 $17.50 make the most sense. Could get them for about $5.50 range, so there is no way this isn’t past $23 ish in almost two years."

2021-06-15 16:34:21,wallstreetbets,Desperately wanna stay short… could be the biggest short squeeze after GME
2021-06-15 18:10:49,wallstreetbets,Congratulations to everybody who got in. As usual I was late to the party once again.

2021-06-15 17:12:35,wallstreetbets,"There seem to be a lot of educated-looking, well-formatted but memey enough looking posts flying around here lately to make me suspicious."
2021-06-15 17:52:51,wallstreetbets,So you’re telling me an account that hasn’t posted in nearly four months who mentions a relatively unknown ticker (hasn’t been posted on WSB in about a month before this) is gonna get a post to blow up like this? Something really fishy going on here.
2021-06-15 18:50:43,wallstreetbets,Who did you write this with and why are your olds posts so retarded and this one not?
2021-06-15 17:05:31,wallstreetbets,"I’m gonna go ahead and say it, this has to be a shill. This post was made right during power hour and was flooded by awards right off the bat. There is no way there were that many organic users sorting by new and gifting awards to this post during power hour.

Edit: this is also the first post or comment by this user in over 100 days. Likely a bought account. Not to mention this post is flooded by people talking about how much Karma this person is and how there’s no way it can be fake yet no one has commented on this guys recent activity. Definitely smells like shill cock and balls to me."
2021-06-15 18:50:33,wallstreetbets,It's so easy to hire someone to write up a post and then pump a stock here?
2021-06-15 17:19:09,wallstreetbets,We should be focused on AMC and GME shorts only. This could be shill.

Defo a long hold - we're still a while off them actually having vehicles on the road. But the testing here in the UK this summer should hopefully provide some more shareholder confidence."

2021-06-15 19:47:20,wallstreetbets,What does warrants mean ? Like dilution?
2021-06-15 19:18:02,wallstreetbets,Answer is in the first 5 words you typed.
2021-06-15 19:13:44,wallstreetbets,"Long periods of nothing but development costs with no sales. Perfect storm for shorters to say ""losing money, sell!"" Until the company loses alot of its stock value and struggles before it can hot the market. 
Or it has enough financial fire power to come through it, like arrival."

2021-06-15 19:44:01,wallstreetbets,Isn’t that bullish? 🤔

2021-06-15 18:29:30,wallstreetbets,Would have appreciated it if it ended up on front page last night - only saw it now after market closed and it already mooned 15%. Thats the problem with retards spamming the same shitty DD on meme stocks - the diamonds get hidden.
2021-06-15 18:28:49,wallstreetbets,"not to mention the deluge of sycophantic comments, I think someone is looking to offload their position on retail"

2021-06-15 17:52:19,wallstreetbets,"Lmao 700 upvotes but 100 awards ? That is pretty insane lol. I agree with what you said about these bought accounts, they’re either new accounts or if they are older than a year the user is inactive for a long stretch, then suddenly has some super informative DD. I don’t trust any ticker I see on here anymore lol, I’m just here to try to warn unsuspecting people. Op may be real, and this could be legit, but it’s WallStreetBots for a reason, this place is bought and used."

2021-06-15 19:11:02,wallstreetbets,How did everything work out?
2021-06-15 16:53:25,wallstreetbets,What put this on your radar a long time ago?
2021-06-15 16:15:11,wallstreetbets,"Agree, I bought and sold a bunch of times around $13. Some news like UPS or another company ordering some Vans would help, so let’s see how it goes. Surprised there isn’t that much premium on this for LEAPS? The $17.50 for Jan 23 cost about $5, I’m shocked if this isn’t $40+ in a year."
2021-06-15 18:33:35,wallstreetbets,"To be honest, I think this one has more of a technical reason for pushing up than AMC considering it’s a 270% borrow rate. That’s a loss of .70% a day just from holding. It’s like being long vxx."

I think this one is up next."
2021-06-15 17:55:00,wallstreetbets,The award to upvote ratio was way larger at the start too. This user has a good amount of posts and DD on WSB months ago. If you take a second to compare the content you’ll notice A LOT of inconsistencies.

2021-06-15 17:01:41,wallstreetbets,"I bought when it was brought to market under the CIIG merger. As soon as it was announced that ARVL was to be the company taking over that ticker I looked into their offering and bought shares of CIIG and held through the merger

They stood out to me as really unique in the EV space"
2021-06-15 16:17:23,wallstreetbets,"I mean it’s quite risky - they are an unproven company, we don’t yet know if their micro factory idea will work, they won’t have actual busses/vans delivered to customers for some time to come.

If the summer tests go well and the tech is proven we could see a huge jump in share price.

Simply Wall Street has ARVL massively undervalued - their fair price is $120!"

2021-06-15 16:19:44,wallstreetbets,Buy the 12/17/2021 $20 I’ve been on those for about a month those with my paltry account but if you can get them still close to the $2.50-$2.75 they are extremely affordable and the metrics are also good
2021-06-15 15:56:22,wallstreetbets,how many?
2021-06-15 16:06:39,wallstreetbets,Any PTs or dates? Like when do the options expire
2021-06-15 18:06:34,wallstreetbets,"Lmao he took 100 days off and is suddenly not retarded? It is pretty fishy. Usually it’s pretty easy to spot the shills/bots, this one Im not 100% sure about but there is some concerning things."
2021-06-15 17:13:11,wallstreetbets,Yeah I didn't get until $14.5ish but it was one of my first SPAC buys
2021-06-15 16:29:59,wallstreetbets,"Risky true but such a huge market and unique. Everyone is making a car or pickup, but vans and buses are brilliant. Don’t know why but I believe this is a huge winner in 2022 and beyond."
2021-06-15 16:08:47,wallstreetbets,"The whale was buying the 6/18 $10 calls and the 6/18 $15 calls, in **SIZE** today.

someone also sold 6/18 $30 puts to buy 6/18 $30 calls, over a million in premium. It is likely ARVL goes nuts tomorrow thru friday over $30."
2021-06-15 19:57:10,wallstreetbets,"This is the longest I’ve ever held a SPAC because I do think their pop up factory system seems cool & once they are delivering busses, it should hit $40 again. 

If that ends up being this week instead of a year from now? I’m also good with that. lol"
2021-06-15 16:24:55,wallstreetbets,"I concur, pretty much the exact same pattern the true runners took. Just sized in huge a few minutes ago and I don’t usually do that unless I think I’m super early, and still feels like that’s the case at these levels."
2021-06-15 16:25:54,wallstreetbets,"I agree, I think this will go over $40 when all is said and done."
2021-06-15 16:48:49,wallstreetbets,Calls or just shares?
2021-06-15 16:29:43,wallstreetbets,"I’m slightly less bullish but definitely think it’ll hit 30-35, that’ll be when I start taking profits."
2021-06-15 17:08:34,wallstreetbets,I only got around to reading it at 4:05pm so shares was all I could. Will look to get calls on any dips tomorrow.

Many of us have watched as shorts attacked this ticker for months. We're finally slowly ramping back up. Baby steps.

If you look at volume and shares available to borrow, shorts have been repositioning themselves since last week. Just today over 600k shares were returned. They know what's coming.

The first catalyst is THURSDAY! We don't even have to wait long for even more buying pressure from whales.

2021-06-15 19:38:34,wallstreetbets,💪
2021-06-15 16:55:48,wallstreetbets,"Devil's advocate:

EVs are kind of a sham. They will be limited in the long term to local commercial use. Otherwise they offer no practical advantage to consumers. They are more expensive and carbon intensive to build, and don't produce the expected reductions in CO output because 60% of electricity is from fossil fuels anyway. Also they are much more sensitive to materials prices in particular because of the metals and rare earths used to produce the batteries. TSLA is successful because they market to rich people, but not every consumer is going to pay for the novelty of having an EV if the premium is too big over conventional, which it will be as fake demand is propped up by propaganda and government intervention. At the end of the day people don't want something that costs more but isn't better. That's why there have been so many high profile EV failures in the speculative tech craze of the last year. Short EVs, or at least don't hold them too long.

On the other hand, I know that I'm right but I might be right too early, which is the same as being wrong."

2021-06-15 17:14:11,wallstreetbets,Great thing about Canoo is the vehicle they're focusing a lot of their energy on is their delivery vehicle so they aren't even competing with traditional car companies.
2021-06-15 17:27:09,wallstreetbets,"That's their focus. The negatives you pointed out. Their 'fleet' vans are for city commercial use. Their first vehicle is price is just under 35k which isn't expensive in today's market considering luxury models are going for 30+ and based on canoo's interior design, it's up to par with luxury packages in vehicles like the Outback, Sorrento, Minivans, etc."
2021-06-15 18:01:53,wallstreetbets,"I appreciate the opposition take.

I don't think it'll happen this way but the Canoo vehicle is supposed to cost like 35k. I think you might also be underestimating the reduced complexity of EVs as compare to ICE vehicles as well, the drivetrain is so much simpler. The improved reliability and lower operation cost (aside from the source of the power, electricity is just cheaper than fuels) is a direct benefit to full cycle cost of ownership to the point that the purchase price doesn't really need to come down to be the same price. Dealerships make a lot less sense for vehicles with improved reliability so startups are going to have an edge over industry players. 

And now for the thing your actually just wrong about - it really doesn't matter if today they grid isn't entirely renewable energy. The economics of energy generation are only pointing one direction - cheaper and greener. You will never make a new gas car run off of electricity (economically) but if a new EV already runs off of 'dirty' electricity (still cleaner than gasoline, even if it never gets better than today) it can improve over time."

2021-06-15 16:25:17,wallstreetbets,"I think the main competitor of Tilray is Canopy Growth $WEED CN. I think they are also ahead of tilray since they have Constellation Brands as its main shareholder. That is why I see Tilray with way more upside here. The company is doing everything you should expect from such a company, they are building brands in all categories (beverages, edibles, medicines, pots, hemp foods, etc..). They merged with APHRIA (one of its biggest competitors) which is still in early stages of synergies (only 6 weeks ago). And they have already the same MKT CAP as Canopy. In my opinion, their only missing point here is one ""Constellation Brads"" like partner to join the boat and I am pretty sure some big players are already considering it. Imagine how much value to shareholders one deal like this will bring. When people say they will not capture US markets once it gets federal legalization for recreational use they are not wrong but this is if you looks at the company in the way it is right now. But don't you think they are not moving on that direction. What is the point to growth in Canadian markets if you are not paying in US? I am sure this is well addressed. I like what I heard yesterday from CEO Irwin Simon and it is just a matter of time for him to deliver. And I think Tilray will deliver sooner rather than later. GLTAL's!!!!"

2021-06-15 16:13:45,wallstreetbets,🍀
2021-06-15 19:01:38,wallstreetbets,"Exactly. Getting in on a squeeze is cool and fun, but this is still a long term investment. Clov actually has growth potential, and had it long before it got memed"
2021-06-15 19:29:41,wallstreetbets,"Not to mention half of the short squeeze picks on here aren't even heavily shorted...CLOV is the real one, apes need focus"
2021-06-15 17:54:53,wallstreetbets,"I actually sell medicare advantage plans for a living and provider relationships can be huge in that space. The fact that they created a system linking patients to doctors is going to be a game changer for them. Theyre plans look pretty decent as well. clov actually does look like it has a lot of potential surprisingly, i believe GME however is the absolute king of this saga. They’re also debt free, loaded with amazon execs now, cohen chairman of the board, 140% +SI, transitioning to e-commerce, new rules being put in by DTCC to end naked shorting, i could go on and on."

2021-06-15 18:30:57,wallstreetbets,I think the bottom for clov was around 9 dollars a share actually
2021-06-15 19:05:36,wallstreetbets,"As someone who has a lot tied up in clov, I'm fully expecting tomorrow to be a bust. The real play is waiting til friday when the hedgefunds shit they asses."

2021-06-15 17:41:29,wallstreetbets,"I appreciate your passion but wholeheartedly disagree. Go to their website and see what they do. Medicare is huge & they are expanding coverage areas. 

“As Clover scales Clover Home Care through Direct Contracting, the company has contracted with Upward Health to provide integrated home-based medical and behavioral care for aligned beneficiaries with complex needs in the States of New York, Pennsylvania, Georgia, and Texas.” 

Now I’m in it for the potential squeeze given it’s extremely high short / float of 37%+ but also comfortable if it doesn’t rocket from a squeeze the investment is a safe(r) bet than other meme stocks. JMO

2021-06-15 16:54:57,wallstreetbets,"Unfortunately you are wrong. They'll just get bailed out. Why? Because some are big enough that if they tank, they take down the whole market with them.

2021-06-15 14:55:21,wallstreetbets,I got into DraftKings when it was down near 40. I'm just kind of dollar cost averaging in. I'm not some redditor trying to promote this stock. I already came to the conclusion that it was a good buy  before I came on this form. I agree with you and will keep buying it up. I also agree with anyone who believes that the report this morning was a straight hit job so that analysts could profit.

2021-06-15 13:43:51,wallstreetbets,"If it dips they will make money if they don’t use Jacob’s ladder, right? and maybe they’ll be smart enough to cover their shorts before they go broke."
2021-06-15 18:13:52,wallstreetbets,"Re  DKNG options trading today:

There was a put option sweep that happens to be bullish, expiring in 3 day(s) on June 18, 2021. This event was a transfer of 200 contract(s) at a $49.00 strike."
2021-06-15 15:00:16,wallstreetbets,Nope. It's still cloudy. As cloudy as the pus leaking from the herpes sores on my wife's lips.
2021-06-15 14:08:27,wallstreetbets,"You have a point. But that’s how Put works. When HFs are shorting, if no one is buying the stock, although the price is dipping, HFs won’t make money because there is no volume which is unrealistic. By buying, we can move up price theoretically, but that’s what HFs want. We keep buying and lose money because Hfs with more money and access to more will keep dipping. They would sell calls and puts to lure retail investors and some PRs to give some hope that it will rebound through medias but then they can crash at any time and claim their profits from selling calls as well."
2021-06-15 14:21:41,wallstreetbets,"I can tell you now that no one short a stock wants the price to go up. If the stock goes down they can do the buying at a lower price than they borrowed it for. They don't make money on volume, they make money when they borrow a stock at a high price and buy it back at a lower price. That's the game"
2021-06-15 14:35:56,wallstreetbets,"They are selling stocks that they borrowed (so they don’t own) if no one is buying, there isn’t much they can make money off. Shorting means they are borrowing stocks to sell and if there is no buyer, how are they gonna make money? When it is lowest, which is hard to tell because they can keep shorting, if many people start buying in, it can squeeze in my opinion."
2021-06-15 14:55:29,wallstreetbets,Yeah that's not how it works man.
2021-06-15 15:10:19,wallstreetbets,How does it work then? Could you explain?
2021-06-15 15:31:10,wallstreetbets,"A short seller borrows a $20 stock. They put up margin for a certain % and pay interest on the balance outstanding to whoever they are borrowing the stock from. They sell the shares at $20 on open market. In their case its probably a very large broker or two fronting the shares. So the short seller has the cash. Stock goes down to $15 they use the cash to buy it at $15 and return the shares to the broker/bank. They pocket the $5 less interest, etc. Stock goes up to $25 and stays there or the banks says we want our shares back, they have to buy the shares at $25 then return to the broker - losing $5/share. Share goes down they win. Share goes up they lose. That is all there is to it.

The squeeze comes when they have to buy shares back in an already rising and heavily shorted stock further driving up the (bid) price, only to return those shares to the broker they borrowed for at a lower price."
2021-06-15 15:35:19,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for your explanation. That’s how I understand shorting and squeeze as well. My theory is that if HFs borrow stocks to sell and no one buys the stock, then (here is where my question comes) how would they make money? They borrowed stocks to sell, but the stock is not being traded because no one trades it."
2021-06-15 15:54:30,wallstreetbets,Ah I see what you are saying now. But they announced the short position already. The deed is done. They sold short already. Now they wait to buy it back lower.
2021-06-15 16:09:42,wallstreetbets,"Yep. I bet they are. I think Draftking is gonna keep dipping. Maybe it will hit $10. I will see when I should buy it. What’s your thought on Draftking? I bet Hfs are reading and monitoring this sub as well now to see how many are buying and what entry we think we should enter, etc."
2021-06-15 17:52:29,wallstreetbets,I own it and if it drops will buy more. This is a market in its infancy. Just look at this sub and the desire to gamble. Scalable business and all electronic. Very high margins with good addressable markets.
2021-06-15 17:55:22,wallstreetbets,"Got ya. I do think Draftking will do well in the future. I am gonna wait till it hits its bottom lol. Got in So_s, thinking it reached its lowest, and little did I know it wasn’t 😂"

2021-06-15 13:17:29,wallstreetbets,"Thank god last month they said specifically workhorse wouldn’t get the usps deal. Said it would go to a car manufacturer with product on the roads already. 

So tesla or ford calls are the play"

2021-06-15 13:15:08,wallstreetbets,Usps is a financial blackhole

2021-06-15 13:20:52,wallstreetbets,Tesla doesn’t build last mile delivery vehicles.. but you’re entitled.
2021-06-15 13:26:01,wallstreetbets,"Ford, Oshkosh or a partnership between ford and someone like grumen will be who gets it. IMO..."
2021-06-15 13:18:48,wallstreetbets,There’s only one play here let’s be real…TSLA lol
2021-06-15 16:15:36,wallstreetbets,"That’s is where you’re wrong. 

Karma is very real. You will suffer from the words you wrote. Much to learn."
2021-06-15 13:28:33,wallstreetbets,"True, however that award was far from transparent and subject to review. Workhorse is on a rally. Let’s go!"
2021-06-15 13:16:27,wallstreetbets,So is everything else that the government runs. What’s new?
2021-06-15 13:24:07,wallstreetbets,But it’s blasphemy to argue with $750B per year for the military
2021-06-15 16:00:25,wallstreetbets,USPS was profitable before the absolutely pants-on-head-retarded PAEA. Thank the “fiscal conservatives” for that.
2021-06-15 13:16:12,wallstreetbets,What’s that got to do with a squeeze!

How disingenuous can you be?"
2021-06-15 13:27:01,wallstreetbets,No it’s not. That’s also fucking outrageous.
2021-06-15 13:47:29,wallstreetbets,Actually the 750B military budget is the only thing keeping your dollar from being zero.
2021-06-15 17:34:00,wallstreetbets,"That may be but usps still has the highest lost package and I don’t care rate of any service. Full of lazy employees that can’t be fired just like teachers and the dmv,"
2021-06-15 13:17:07,wallstreetbets,There’s no squeeze on usps
2021-06-15 16:26:48,wallstreetbets,I posted a thorough write up on WSB’s with my position. This is news.
2021-06-15 17:58:49,wallstreetbets,"Yikes big Karen energy

2021-06-15 18:30:38,wallstreetbets,I have love for amc so don’t take this the wrong way amc holders lol. I think they are going to  drop Gme price drastically and let amc squeeze  and surpass the Gme price and make it seem like Gme is dead and that the only stock to squeeze is amc to try to make people either switch sides  or sell their Gme .
2021-06-15 18:11:08,wallstreetbets,They deleted all my GME posts. Hopefully this stays and go to the top for all of us
2021-06-15 14:32:53,wallstreetbets,"Your girlfriends boyfriend is proud!

Was a ghost town for GME.

Were going to the fuckin moon, the real question is which one."
2021-06-15 15:25:38,wallstreetbets,"Idiot. You’re a bit late. If you really think GME is going to make significant money for you at this point, you sir are truly retarded. They can’t even get consoles, so how do you think the earnings calls will go? Apes broke together."
2021-06-15 17:29:18,wallstreetbets,Only 98%? That’s not good enough.
2021-06-15 18:29:24,wallstreetbets,"Great job! I hold both, AMC heavy. But I just can’t let my 29 GME go for anything. I only hold AMC and GME. Buying anything else just slows the squeeze down in my eyes. Whatever… not stressing one bit. Nice to see dumb money is still out here. I love you 🍌🖍🍌🖍🍌🖍🍌"

2021-06-15 19:28:05,wallstreetbets,Just curious what is the play currently? Since the 140$ of float short I have to reasonably assume has long since been covered by them
2021-06-15 13:15:30,wallstreetbets,👍👍✌
2021-06-15 15:23:14,wallstreetbets,Whale or Wendy's.

2021-06-15 13:38:39,wallstreetbets,"Yeah the only posts I see now are, let’s pump this or short interest on this random piece of shit stock is at an all time high. Sub has gone to shit sadly"

2021-06-15 13:50:18,wallstreetbets,"Exactly.

All that matters is GME (and AMC for the folk who don’t have the cash to buy GME).

Everything else is just a distraction."
2021-06-15 15:06:24,wallstreetbets,"This just gives us more time to pick up more shares. Once Jeff leaves AMZN next month I'm selling most of my shares I picked up in 2017 so I can buy more GME, the new AMZN."

2021-06-15 16:33:13,wallstreetbets,its so fucking obvious now that they are pumping other stocks and try to make gme fade
2021-06-15 19:55:33,wallstreetbets,"That’s ok, I’m happy to take money selling calls!"
2021-06-15 17:55:26,wallstreetbets,"To be fair they’re all pump and dumps. People like different stocks for different reasons. These stocks are traded on game theory alone. There’s no underlying fundamentals to justify the prices of any of the WSB favorites. That’s why it’s funny. 

Why so serious?"
2021-06-15 18:28:00,wallstreetbets,Well at the time it was going down and didn’t look to be coming back 20 points in 1 day after a 100 point drop last week is big enough

2021-06-15 17:43:03,wallstreetbets,Hacked for weeks on end without DFV telling Twitter support about it? No attempt to warn his Twitter followers? Is the idea that he hasn't noticed he's been hacked (by someone who is very good at replicating his style) or that he doesn't care?
2021-06-15 17:49:38,wallstreetbets,"It's the wsb equivalent of ""go big or go home,"" ""all or nothing,"" etc.

2021-06-15 15:33:38,wallstreetbets,"Its a dead giveaway when they say ""we need more people in this one..."" like, can you more obviously try to paint reddit users as the manipulators? Lol.

2021-06-15 14:42:47,wallstreetbets,"The account is usually under a year, mostly posts here, and pushes short of the week meme stocks (even though squeezes take time and sustained numbers).  Boomer stock pushers as well, BB for instance.  It's a great long term stock, but not a bet or a squeeze like they pretend. Sometimes they spread FUD around GME, and to a lesser extent AMC."
2021-06-15 17:00:37,wallstreetbets,Subs dead bro
2021-06-15 17:47:02,wallstreetbets,So... basically the same thing as GME.
2021-06-15 14:20:19,wallstreetbets,"Funny saying the sub has gone to trash and GME is all that matters...

The sub went to shit with GMEs rise to power.

I personally don't care tho, because my brokerage account has never looked better.

EDIT: I'm not hating on GME, but the sub went to 10 mil subscribers after it started to moon. Facts are facts, the sub completely changed."
2021-06-15 19:48:59,wallstreetbets,"$100 in GME will get you much farther than $100 in AMC.

Share price doesn't matter. It's all about percentage gains.

Unless your broker doesn't allow fractionals. Then I understand."
2021-06-15 14:42:00,wallstreetbets,">All that matters is GME

lol so you hate money got it."
2021-06-15 19:42:05,wallstreetbets,There was easy money to be made on said distractions though. I agree however that none of those other tickers are going to 100+ like it’s being claimed. Take the first spike and gtfo

Me too brotha!"
2021-06-15 14:57:26,wallstreetbets,"That is quite different than the shill posts trying to convince everyone that a company like Wish ""is a short squeeze"" lol. Nice work playing the Wishtards for some tendies though!"
2021-06-15 15:01:11,wallstreetbets,"Low karma, their Reddit account is under 6 months old, their posts/comments are in slightly broken English and are low effort (in context or in length), senseless emoji comments with a ticker that are easy to replicate or copy/paste so that they can just feed it into their bot program and it makes a bunch of different iterations to avoid spam filter, they have no other posts/comments besides some from the past couple weeks all shilling the same ticker.

If two or three of those apply, there's a high likelihood it's either a bot or a purchased account. If more than 3 apply, 99.9% certainly it's a bot."
2021-06-15 14:38:59,wallstreetbets,I think the metric is if someone sells and profits off of AMC/GME they are a shill. If you hold from $480 down to $40 back up to $280 then buy more you are a well respected member of the ape community.
2021-06-15 18:46:56,wallstreetbets,"I would say this sub is flooded with bullshit posts suggesting that every stock with a short interest is a ""short squeeze"" and hurry up and get in on it apes! The only real potential for a squeeze is AMC since a gamma squeeze will be very likely if the stock price hits certain threshholds. In that instance it does actually matter if a ton of people are holding the stock instead of day trading it. This friday is when a ton of call options expire and if the price shoots up it just might trigger it. It is also equally possible the stock price hovers in a dangerous game of chicken. Nobody wants to sell and big players don't want to tip the scales. It could sit a certain price for quite a while and then slowly tank or just tank all at once with short ladder attacks. But what do I know? I am just another retarded ape."

2021-06-15 14:58:34,wallstreetbets,Most accounts are 4 months old (after January) and they never post their positions.

2021-06-15 14:56:45,wallstreetbets,"Yeah. I'm one of those randoms who came here through word of mouth during the GME craze, so take my knowledge with a grain of salt, but from the old post history it used to be all about big feast or famine calls and puts on retarded DD theories. Now it's the same 5 ""short"" stocks, with the oldest being swapped out for a new one every two weeks (pushed by swarms of new accounts).

Phase 1: wallstreetbets.  Phase 2: GMEbets.  Phase 3: wallstreetshills.

Maybe when we get bored and stop being useful tools, it'll go back to the old days, idk."
2021-06-15 15:50:32,wallstreetbets,I’m 1 of those 10 mil. Joined for the money and stayed for the gains porn.
2021-06-15 14:26:18,wallstreetbets,It was definitely the nail in the coffin. But the sub had been slightly changing for a while with bots and hedge funds starting to keep watch. I think it’s mainly the mods changing / capitulating that’s been the real killer.

10,000,000% hard agree"
2021-06-15 18:35:28,wallstreetbets,The sub did not go to shit we just became a lot more confident think about the amount of wealth on this sub before and after it all started

2021-06-15 16:17:43,wallstreetbets,"> Maybe when we get bored and stop being useful tools

I think they didn't know how powerful we were. Honestly the options plays were starting to move markets.

The clap back is not about GME- GME is about them losing control. Even with payment for order flow and front running our purchases, they could not control us.

This new wallstreetshills is about destroying the credibility and power of the sub."
2021-06-15 16:35:35,wallstreetbets,"If you already held from 40 its because you really believed it will come back and facts show that its the case so selling on 280 after all of that instead of waiting it to go higher would be the stupid move. If it were to crash it would have already on 40, and if they were not worried they wont be acting like this to this day."

2021-06-15 14:19:32,wallstreetbets,"Don’t buy options, or if you do, make sure they’re near the money and far out (more expensive, but less expensive than losing everything on less expensive calls ending soon). Stocks are better if you really suck at timing the market. You might holding for 20 years, but there’s a very very good chance you will ultimately make money (as long as you’re not buying truly speculative stocks, like nothing but penny biotechs—although even there, you’re probably going to hit at least one or two that will have a run up at some point)."

2021-06-15 19:50:38,wallstreetbets,Good luck buddy! I put it at $45 fair market value today. Here’s hoping.

2021-06-15 16:46:03,wallstreetbets,Inferior resins will make your pp rot off.
2021-06-15 14:28:36,wallstreetbets,"Because you're supporting the CCP

Edit: downvoted because reddit is owned by the ccp. My comment is not false."
2021-06-15 15:00:07,wallstreetbets,Right in the feels.
2021-06-15 15:18:43,wallstreetbets,0 comment karma LOL not even trying
2021-06-15 14:54:58,wallstreetbets,"It’s gone up $0.20/share in the last hour.

You do realize people have access to smart phones, right?"
2021-06-15 14:44:03,wallstreetbets,I missed the dump!
2021-06-15 19:39:52,wallstreetbets,"I see, I see, fair does man! Tendies soon!!"
2021-06-15 14:43:31,wallstreetbets,"The only post and comments from this account are pushing wish. Either brain dead, bot or shill"
2021-06-15 15:39:56,wallstreetbets,"Yeah but WISH items take like two months to get to consumer. It’s pretty much dropshipping. The good thing about dropshipping from china is that returns are very low. However, after two months of waiting for a product and the low quality will not retain customers... I’d bet WISH goes to zero but I don’t short/use puts on stocks, I don’t have the patience."
2021-06-15 14:45:57,wallstreetbets,A dying industry giant is the best way to play value
2021-06-15 14:35:48,wallstreetbets,Everything you use is made in China. You think the party stuff you bought from Wish is from China but the party stuff you bought from Party City/Amazon is not?
2021-06-15 18:01:59,wallstreetbets,"Only difference when buying from Amazon is you're likely lining the pockets of a 3rd party Amazon seller who ordered from the CCP in the first place. 

Also much faster delivery. Can't have it all."
2021-06-15 19:13:55,wallstreetbets,I didn’t even know what comment karma is. Total Reddit noob. That doesn’t invalidate the points. 🤷‍♂️
2021-06-15 16:40:55,wallstreetbets,"I mean he was spamming $WISH shit 2 weeks ago, when it was 8.68. It's currently 11.36 and was 12.50 today at one point. I'd say that's not so bad...

Though I don't disagree that it's basically a shill bot."
2021-06-15 15:05:07,wallstreetbets,"He’s just a dude who wants people on his stock, not a shill. A shill is someone paid or once incentivized by another party to spread messages. If my boy over here is 100000 into clov, sure as fuck he’s gonna be promoting it but doesn’t make him a shill lol"
2021-06-15 15:42:10,wallstreetbets,You realize Amazon and Alibaba both wanted to buy WISH but the CEO wouldn’t settle for 10 billion? That’s someone who is confident in their future. I strongly believe we will see it go over 18 in the next few months. But we are both entitled to our opinion so I guess we will see.
2021-06-15 17:36:48,wallstreetbets,Buying puts?
2021-06-15 18:31:56,wallstreetbets,"Nah. Its not the same. China made products, which are imported and taxed appropriately and approved for the US market (Amazon stuff) are better than products made in chinese factories which dont have license to import. These companies are propped up by the CCP and include technologies and patents stolen from american companies. When you buy from wish, you are avoiding protections in place by the american government to prevent such flood of stolen IP and products that dont meet code for health and pollution reasons.

Amazon is an american company, morality aside it's out company to prop up.

Wish is the CCP, and there is little difference between wish.com and the CCP"
2021-06-15 17:20:50,wallstreetbets,"No, pretty sure he's getting paid."
2021-06-15 15:48:07,wallstreetbets,"That was a rumor, meaning that it could be that it never happened. For the sake of your argument, if Amazon wanted it, it would have it. Also, I highly doubt Amazon would want WISH, there is nothing special that they do that amazon doesn’t do much better. 

Yes, good talk."
2021-06-15 18:38:11,wallstreetbets,"Wish is an American company (just like a Amazon). There’s no extra quality control for Amazon products that are not sold by Amazon (3rd party seller, which is 80% of Amazon products)."
2021-06-15 19:15:45,wallstreetbets,"Nope. New to Reddit... 🤷‍♂️ 

I didn’t know what karma point were until a week ago 😂"
2021-06-15 16:59:27,wallstreetbets,"LOL it's not a rumor. Amazon offered 10 bil and Peter declined. The CEO is all in and still holds an absurd amount of shares. The recent partnership with PrestaShop is an example of why a financially sound company would want to work with WISH. Just because the market they serve is a HH income avg of about 75k or less doesn't mean it can't be an insanely profitable business. WISH more than anyone was impacted by the vid because most of the suppliers in China we're under harsh lockdown requirements. 

Also saying cheap products and China doesn't add validity to your argument. Pick up some better verbage 👊🏻"
2021-06-15 16:03:29,wallstreetbets,"It’s not a rumor. I’d send you a source, but you’d probably deny credibility of whatever I sent you. Literally search it yourself and see."

2021-06-15 14:21:54,wallstreetbets,We need to break 15
2021-06-15 14:28:55,wallstreetbets,15 is a given. This is a growth stock. This can keep going up for years and years if they maintain their current growth.
2021-06-15 14:47:23,wallstreetbets,After 15 I see 30. Will take a little time
2021-06-15 13:04:12,wallstreetbets,"Ever heard of a premium dude? Your better of buying calls on a random stock. Calls are not the play on AMC, shares yes but calls at this price is ridiculous and asking to get kilt"
2021-06-15 13:09:33,wallstreetbets,your rocket is going in the wrong direction on the chart
2021-06-15 13:03:06,wallstreetbets,This is beyond retarded.
2021-06-15 13:11:08,wallstreetbets,Holy hell batman. Red crayon's are definitely your favorite.... Followed with a theta gang fucking.
2021-06-15 13:16:44,wallstreetbets,Ha ha this wouldve been a good lesson if you were smart enough to learn from it
2021-06-15 13:07:11,wallstreetbets,"Asking a stranger to kick you in the balls is way cheaper and most likely feels the same on 7/9.. good luck though, hope it plays out."
2021-06-15 13:07:18,wallstreetbets,The theta gang will surely appreciate your donation.
2021-06-15 13:25:09,wallstreetbets,Annnnnd it’s Gone
2021-06-15 13:40:31,wallstreetbets,I don’t think your autist level can even be considered ape. You’re a freaking Magikarp.
2021-06-15 13:19:22,wallstreetbets,Good idea to get in on those calls during the middle of an intense run up. The stock could go up and these still lose value.
2021-06-15 13:22:13,wallstreetbets,What the fuck is wrong with you?
2021-06-15 13:26:31,wallstreetbets,This is the highly non functional autism I come here for.

2021-06-15 13:15:09,wallstreetbets,This is not good.
2021-06-15 13:19:04,wallstreetbets,Theta would like to know your location
2021-06-15 13:21:51,wallstreetbets,My wife’s boyfriend is happy you bought his options. My wife is in for a treat tonight.
2021-06-15 14:13:07,wallstreetbets,Father theta always wins.
2021-06-15 14:43:04,wallstreetbets,Nobody tell him about thetagang.
2021-06-15 15:21:12,wallstreetbets,"Rocket malfunction huh, good stuff, keep up the good work. 
I'll just buy shares instead."
2021-06-15 16:43:44,wallstreetbets,This is ridiculous call. U r fucking retarded dude
2021-06-15 13:19:43,wallstreetbets,Not sure what all the options shade is about but my 1/21/22 12C is printing right now.

2021-06-15 19:25:25,wallstreetbets,Jesus Christ
2021-06-15 13:10:51,wallstreetbets,In fact it’ll probably feel better than watching you flush $9k down the toilet. At least some theta gang dude got to line their pockets.
2021-06-15 13:10:07,wallstreetbets,yes we do
2021-06-15 14:45:44,wallstreetbets,Your breakeven isn't $114 and doesn't expire in 3 weeks.

2021-06-15 19:47:59,wallstreetbets,"nah, he just needs a spike in price to raise IV. he can sell calls for a profit without price getting remotely close to $115"
2021-06-15 13:20:12,wallstreetbets,You should put it all into options for more leverage instead. That's what a Chad would do.
2021-06-15 13:21:22,wallstreetbets,Holy hell batman.... This is gonna be awesome
2021-06-15 13:50:43,wallstreetbets,"For everyone following along, this is my yolo. This isn’t a quick flip, this is your chance for potential TSLA / AMZN like returns over the next 5-7 years.

2021-06-15 17:52:24,wallstreetbets,"Tbh, it’s prob because apes buying on robinhood and they basically sell you an IOU on the stock and not actual shares."
2021-06-15 13:41:20,wallstreetbets,I’m shocked at the $45 calls
2021-06-15 14:19:18,wallstreetbets,With you ape. I have 450
2021-06-15 15:25:44,wallstreetbets,"Short interest appears to be around 17% according to fintel.

https://fintel.io/ss/us/wish


There does seem to be a lot of shares available to short, over 7million will a rather low borrow fee. Doesn't seem like it's heavily shorted. Just my opinion.

2021-06-15 17:47:14,wallstreetbets,I’d make over a million from that on my July $20 calls. Yes please.

Hindenburg massively shorted DKNG yesterday, quite conveniently right before they released this so-called research. Even other financial institutions are crying foul and saying their own research does not corroborate what Hindenburg claims.

IMO, this is EXACTLY where apes should be putting their money. We’ve never been ones to let a HF control the narrative, especially when it’s all a lie to increase their short profits."

Note the word ""main"". This information was corroborated dumbfuck. 

>Hindenburg massively shorted DKNG yesterday, quite conveniently right before they released this so-called research.

Also note the word ""yesterday"". As in they weren't short the day before, or while they were compiling the report. It was only after they discovered that DK is about to take it in the fucking ass from state's Attorney General'sdid they short the stock. That's important information there, dumbfuck. 

>Even other financial institutions are crying foul

Because they have skin in the game and don't want to take a loss. Even a dumbfuck like you could've figured that out.

Loss of gambling license, loss of all revenue, assets frozen. People like you investing are then stuck holding squat.

But on the flip side you have issues with this, but you have no problem with some random stranger on Reddit telling you to buy something, which he or she already owns, literally to get you to buy and trust that person is just going to hold because they said so? Ok"

2021-06-15 13:13:22,wallstreetbets,Placing burry in the same crowd is a major upset.
2021-06-15 14:12:41,wallstreetbets,I don’t mind if it tanks for a week and then shoots back up.

2021-06-15 12:59:53,wallstreetbets,"Tesla is stupid overvalued. They only make money by selling ev credits given to them by the US govt. And the CEO is a loose cannon. 

Kinds sad but i wish the fidelity mutual fund i have some money in would just unload its entire postion in TSLA."
2021-06-15 16:00:29,wallstreetbets,"To me the biggest problem of Tesla is not called Wall Street, it's called BMW, Mercedes, and Porsche."
2021-06-15 13:06:09,wallstreetbets,Tesla = poop.
2021-06-15 12:49:45,wallstreetbets,The continuous shorting of the app is what has resulted in it jumping up so much when they have to rush to cover
2021-06-15 13:19:46,wallstreetbets,"Might be a loose cannon, on Twitter, but he's getting the manufacturing cost down, and fixing problems mid assembly line."
2021-06-15 14:13:05,wallstreetbets,The company sucks. Without the us govt welfare it would be bankrupt
2021-06-15 18:00:16,wallstreetbets,"The company is currently greatly overvalued, yes, but the company is ridiculously far ahead of everyone else. They're in a massive expansion mode right now that will back dividends.

Despite having had all the time in the world, it's a startup that will soon produce cars like toys with a mega casting. That will save them truckloads of money, the cars will be built faster, the quality will go up rapidly and they will save a lot of space replacing all the previous robots they had.

The fact that others didn't is the key factor, they operate slow as hell and are conservative on new technologies. Tesla is way ahead of the competition and then we're only talking about their car division."
2021-06-15 14:56:41,wallstreetbets,guess we'll see.
2021-06-15 18:40:08,wallstreetbets,"Negative ghostrider. Ford and gm have stalwart production facilities in place with a massive focus on ev vehicles. 

Tsla cant fuckin touch ford and they about to get their face stomped in with the new ford ev line up."
2021-06-15 19:20:36,wallstreetbets,"Tesla's stock may very low well drop significantly, but long term, there's no competition. Ford are WAY behind. The Cybertruck is more powerful and with a better range. I'd be very surprised if Ford could make a profit on the F150 lightning. They don't produce their own battery and it seems to be significantly larger than the Cybertruck, despite inferior specs.

Cybertruck will use their own new 4680 cells, much cheaper, far more powerful and more energy dense. They'll make bank on it. They have far more reservations as well."
2021-06-15 19:40:21,wallstreetbets,How many fleets and businesses are gonna buy a tesla truck with no dealer network for service?
2021-06-15 12:35:37,wallstreetbets,Saw a VZIO DD on this sub just this morning. Congrats!
2021-06-15 12:31:37,wallstreetbets,Yaaaaas! I'm in! Moon TVs here we come!
2021-06-15 12:39:08,wallstreetbets,"Nice!
When did you buy and how did you know this is the play?"
2021-06-15 14:27:04,wallstreetbets,Unrealized gains aren’t gains bro.
2021-06-15 12:32:44,wallstreetbets,I’m so mad i didn’t get in when i seen the alert fck
2021-06-15 13:20:30,wallstreetbets,"This place is officially becoming a one day pump and dump group.  Reminds me of the crepto sub late 2017/early 2018.

The same exact thing happened to Wendy's a few days ago.


There isn't even enough time to let my trades to clear before this subreddit is dumping, which I guess is a good thing."
2021-06-15 12:37:26,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, this is fucked. Literally the day after I offload bcus of zero movement and zero volume. I even brought it up MANY times in WSB and got shot down. Now look. FUCK."

2021-06-15 13:30:11,wallstreetbets,Hope you sold
2021-06-15 17:12:35,wallstreetbets,Did you sell?!
2021-06-15 12:44:55,wallstreetbets,Probably seen a little talk on here check and saw cheap af options and figured wtf why not. That's what I've done with some trades. Some work great others don't but when it pops you hit big and when it tanks you don't lose much 🤷‍♂️
2021-06-15 15:19:57,wallstreetbets,Gains are gains but they aren’t GAINZ
2021-06-15 12:39:50,wallstreetbets,Where are you getting the alerts?
2021-06-15 12:33:46,wallstreetbets,It hasn’t hit its May high so you still have time!
2021-06-15 13:03:44,wallstreetbets,What alert..?
2021-06-15 13:31:24,wallstreetbets,My favorite is when a long position of mine pumps then dumps and I just hold and watch the action.
2021-06-15 18:37:28,wallstreetbets,You're welcome for the wendys tendies
2021-06-15 12:40:15,wallstreetbets,Let me know the next time you make a play so I can do the opposite

2021-06-15 16:27:56,wallstreetbets,Hahahahahaha what a bitch
2021-06-15 13:22:44,wallstreetbets,"I’ll bite, bid/ask is part of “level II” market data on Robinhood and on a different screen/page altogether so it’s literally “uncropable” considering it’s not on the same page. 

If you’re not a retard or an “autist” you might find r/daytrading or r/stocks a lot more palatable."
2021-06-15 12:59:06,wallstreetbets,"true, it happened to me with CRSR yesterday"
2021-06-15 16:44:51,wallstreetbets,"As someone who has proudly owned a phone with the number $60,000/+1.200% and didn’t realize, I can say that no, unrealized gains turn into perpetual regret and nightmares."

2021-06-15 18:44:18,wallstreetbets,"I do see your timing was amazing, and possible one of the catalyst that got me to buy, but I fomoed a little more when it spiked and my average is about current sp.

I'm planning on buying more if it gets back to $22-20"
2021-06-15 12:49:24,wallstreetbets,"Same, I was holding 100 June 18 contracts for 30x potential but sold 30 min before"
2021-06-15 13:04:03,wallstreetbets,Or maybe the retards can listen when I present bargains as I had done on numerous threads.
2021-06-15 15:28:43,wallstreetbets,Fuckin OUCH
2021-06-15 16:21:36,wallstreetbets,Nooooo. Had to clear some money and pay for a $2600 fucking window in my house. VZIO was the sacrifice since it was the weakest.
2021-06-15 13:28:37,wallstreetbets,Bid/ask for the contacts
2021-06-15 14:07:07,wallstreetbets,"Hes saying scroll down to where it shows your actual position, what strike/date"

2021-06-15 13:55:47,wallstreetbets,"Wow.. 13 days ago and you got shuttered.. even in r/investing

You got my follow bud!"
2021-06-15 18:30:17,wallstreetbets,"Ahh fuck man thats such bad timing for something, especially a window lol. I see the logic in what you did. The bright side is there are always going to be more stocks that will pop off and if you were able to pick out a stock that moon'd then your insticts are honed in!"
2021-06-15 16:17:24,wallstreetbets,I too wouldn’t mind the discord link
2021-06-15 19:18:23,wallstreetbets,"You know what was bad timing? My well pump going out during my layoff in quarantine. That sucked right there, especially when you had no idea if you had a job anymore. Panic. Lol. Yeah, ill hop back in soon. Bright side is it dropped back down to the price I sold it at yesterday lol"
2021-06-15 12:39:25,wallstreetbets,I'm in with you with shares my brother.
2021-06-15 13:26:43,wallstreetbets,"Just in 20 shares 210. Best deal I find this week. If someone know better deal, let me know"
2021-06-15 12:39:57,wallstreetbets,"This is value play man going to be a slow burn recovery. Would advise against the options.

Edit: hodling 30 ADRs and 500 of the HK shares"
2021-06-15 12:40:19,wallstreetbets,"Nice idea on leaps.    
Fingers crossed for you man.    
Was on here to see if there's a reason it broke down past 210 resistance today"
2021-06-15 16:02:31,wallstreetbets,"Guys buy shares not options on this. This is a long term value play. $1,000 is possible"
2021-06-15 12:51:19,wallstreetbets,"Same.

Wait, by locked and loaded you mean BABA has you ready to end it all? Same."
2021-06-15 13:01:52,wallstreetbets,$BABA 💎🚀
2021-06-15 13:21:37,wallstreetbets,went in on baba too
2021-06-15 14:07:19,wallstreetbets,"When is it going up?

I like averaging down but I'm running out of money"
2021-06-15 14:08:59,wallstreetbets,I’ve been holding 30 January contracts since January. I was up huge at one point now I’m hemorrhaging. They don’t expire until a while so I’m holding would love to see you turn around
2021-06-15 16:08:43,wallstreetbets,Got myself BABE.. Err I mean BABA
2021-06-15 12:49:31,wallstreetbets,"$WOOF why do you hate it, if you have no idea? 
They’ve been rebranding to wellness focus, all health related for pets, even removed all shocked collars. Their brick and mortar stores allows one delivery, compare to chewy. Also free shipping/same day delivery is $35 compare to Chewy’s $50 and petsmart at 49. Wellness aspect is something you cannot get from chewy, like vets, grooming etc.  The drawback is their debt, partially why they did IPO to pay off some."
2021-06-15 15:04:37,wallstreetbets,"ASO is always down when an event happens. Few days and it goes up. This time there was two events, so no wonder it's down. It's at a discount. I bought more calls."
2021-06-15 12:38:04,wallstreetbets,It’s a good day to enter ASO as it’s down 5% for no apparent reason
2021-06-15 18:56:51,wallstreetbets,"I like a bunch of those too. Particularly ASO. 

Nasdaq just posted this today as one of three stocks with unusual options activity:

| “Academy Sports & Outdoors Inc (Symbol: ASO options are showing a volume of 17,370 contracts thus far today. That number of contracts represents approximately 1.7 million underlying shares, working out to a sizeable 75.7% of ASO's average daily trading volume over the past month, of 2.3 million shares. Particularly high volume was seen for the $40 strike call option expiring June 18, 2021, with 4,854 contracts trading so far today, representing approximately 485,400 underlying shares of ASO.”

So, that means 21% of ASO’s average daily volume just traded today for June 18 calls @ $40. 

I don’t know what that means…but seems like someone is making a big bet."
2021-06-15 12:37:35,wallstreetbets,Only one stock for life $AMC.
2021-06-15 12:48:22,wallstreetbets,$SDC is another great target 🎯 join r/StockSDC we take it to the moon 🚀🚀🚀
2021-06-15 14:16:28,wallstreetbets,BGS makes a lovely can of beans. In on it as a stock as well.
2021-06-15 13:02:35,wallstreetbets,Basically all metrics look like garbage.
2021-06-15 13:19:39,wallstreetbets,"Btw, it appears that the market as a whole is bear today because of the Fed's press conference on inflation."
2021-06-15 14:23:40,wallstreetbets,"I think it was down because of the retail report today. Honestly tho, doesn’t matter to me. I love buying shit on sale."
2021-06-15 12:41:36,wallstreetbets,Just threw the cherry on top with 1 more Oct 55c contract today
2021-06-15 19:11:47,wallstreetbets,"Dude, when is this sub gonna catch on. I’ve come across a number of people who love ASO, literally nobody who’s bearish on it (except people who won’t stop talking about GME), and there have been solid DD posts about it over time.

This options activity is just the icing on the cake. First, it’s just a great healthy stock. Second, it’s being heavily shorted >20%. Now there’s massive options activity? Seems clear where the wind is blowing…."
2021-06-15 12:43:44,wallstreetbets,If you never sell you never get to eat your tendies

2021-06-15 14:20:17,wallstreetbets,Plenty of creamy soups too ;)
2021-06-15 13:32:10,wallstreetbets,Own a dog or a pet?
2021-06-15 14:19:16,wallstreetbets,Yeah I know the FED meeting but it seems the outdoors retail was hit unnecessarily harder than the rest of the market
2021-06-15 13:31:45,wallstreetbets,Same. The brief discount was too good to pass up and will pay off easily
2021-06-15 14:21:04,wallstreetbets,Dogs are pets too
2021-06-15 14:29:40,wallstreetbets,"Yes. That’s what I mean. Want to say one but ended up typing both. 

Anyways, I know there are people who hate woof but never really gave a great explanation. So I wanna know in details why"
2021-06-15 14:39:19,wallstreetbets,"I know I was just messing with you man. I just wouldn’t pay for WOOFs products, so I shouldn’t invest in them. It’s more convenient for me to quickly grab my dog a bag of food off the shelf on my trip to the grocery store than to wait for it to be shipped to me. I also don’t like the whole “Amazon for pets” thing. I do wish you the best of luck on your investment though!"
2021-06-15 12:27:28,wallstreetbets,I bought a few calls yesterday. It saved me today while everything else getting donged.

2021-06-15 12:26:29,wallstreetbets,Glad I bought some 7/16 calls this morning. Mad I didn't grab a couple 6/18 for kicks.
2021-06-15 12:27:41,wallstreetbets,Viac ?
2021-06-15 12:31:15,wallstreetbets,What was the catalyst?  I didn’t hear anything
2021-06-15 14:24:18,wallstreetbets,"I don’t often watch porn, but when I do it is on a Vizio 85” HDR screen.  That way I can leave my wife and her boyfriend alone for the night. VZIO 🚀"

2021-06-15 19:31:26,wallstreetbets,How could you forget the Baja San Felipe 250 where they entered their truck and barely made it past the start line before breaking down then trying to cut across the middle of the track and then being kicked off the track for doing so.

2021-06-15 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$TTCF DD: Gordon Ramsay Cooking Up The Tendies &#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ldqey3ny6g571.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=feff8346992b1f20012cd8a888375bc200e29b5d

“Why did the chicken cross the road? Because you didn’t f—ing cook it!"" I felt it would be best to start off this DD with this quote from Gordon because this is something he would never say to Tattooed Chef because they are one of the fastest growing plant-based food brands with vertically integrated manufacturing.

**TLDR:**

* Rock solid fundamentals if any of you smooth brains care
* One of the few profitable food brands in this space due to low manufacturing costs
* Passes[ the SMELL test](https://www.reddit.com/user/pennyether/comments/nzd2zi/whats_that_smell/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) with flying colors. Over 30% Short Interest very high
* Super low IV, IV in the 50%'s unheard of in meme stocks
* They have an absolute Chad of a CEO who has worked in food business for over 35 years and his daughter is creative designer of the food products
* I'm no Gordon Ramsay but this has all the ingredients of a perfect ground floor meme stock with disgustingly low IV

&#x200B;

[The Brand](https://preview.redd.it/fiqro35ecg571.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=58ebb1a2c6a7a11301f573f3bf669971b0be3b83)

Tattooed Chef is a plant-based food brand. They are available in stores like Target, Walmart, Costco, and Sam's Club. The company is entirely vertically integrated which gives them a massive edge of the competition. They have been building manufacturing infrastructure since 2010. This company has great growth potential and is rapidly expanding. You might be thinking to yourself right now I'm tired of this plant based shit I don't even care if the burger is still Moo'ing on the plate, but hang with me this industry is experiencing huge growth as the younger generations eat this stuff up.

&#x200B;

[Finances](https://preview.redd.it/yw8qcay9cg571.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=f8b6aef8c9c960027351e210c9298296e9764bad)

For full year 2021, Tattooed Chef updated its guidance and expects:

* Revenue in the range of $235 million to $242 million, an increase of 58 to 63% compared to 2020. This guidance excludes any revenue contribution from the Karsten facility which is currently not in operation. The Company expects to update guidance when production begins at that facility in the coming months.
* Gross margin in the range of 20% to 25%
* Adjusted EBITDA in the range of $2 million to $4 million
* TTCF has a current market cap of 1.89B
* Insiders own 38% of the company

&#x200B;

[Advertising and Social Media Presence](https://preview.redd.it/3n21s0n1cg571.jpg?width=480&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9f17957894ac096f09ca6c303beb1a72ac08d7ed)

They've spent like 0 dollars on advertising. They developed a plan to hit 2 billion impressions in the form of 6 and 16 second videos in the first 8 months of 2021. This is the first time they're spending advertising dollars and they have already built up a loyal following. You can see on Twitter posts of pictures of local Target frozen shelves being out of TTCF stock. Search Twitter for $TTCF and you'll see them. Also the comments on TTCF's official twitter account have stuff like ""yo get the product in my target please, it's always out of stock"" and ""when you gonna be in Europe please"". They have a very popular product that is flying off the shelves. Before 2021, their only sales team was the CEO and his daughter. Now, they've hired marketing teams to get them into more retail stores, like an ex-Coca Cola national sales manager to boost marketing.

[Expansion into Overseas Markets](https://preview.redd.it/vmchh45w8g571.jpg?width=1009&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a3bb207edfabd7b103a338dd4a257d7051df5c1b)

Europe has a strong demand for their products, as plant-based proteins are growing in popularity. TTCF has 2 manufacturing plants, one in California and one in Italy. It's cheaper for them to ship ingredients from Italy to the US for their US operations. So they're looking to hire sales in Europe to get TTCF in stores there. They have already entered into Costco UK and are expanding over the continent

&#x200B;

[Short Interest and Low IV](https://preview.redd.it/7xgcp2z39g571.jpg?width=958&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b92c4e7683fc76b00dbcb08a87b3145f433362ff)

TTCF has very low IV and SI of over 30%. It is currently one of the most shorted stocks on the market. This is a stock with solid fundamentals and rapid growth. In my opinion calls are not priced accordingly and you seeing this early could get in on the ground floor while IV is still laughably low. Volume on it is low as well and the float is on the smaller side. If you are able to get in while IV is low this thing could take off.

2021-06-15 16:17:26,wallstreetbets,"Unlike GME, AMC, WISH (Which I' am bearish on) and all the other ""meme stocks"",  $TTCF is a low risk play with very high potential. All the shorts have demolished this stock to it's all time low of $15 a share. This stock is just starting to recover from the damage. This company has demonstrated it's potential with revenue growth of  60% in 2020  and is expected to continue to grow. This is not meme stock move. Although I am not a financial advisor and sniff glue for fun, this stock is a stock to hold and will be 5x mover within the next couple of years.

2021-06-15 14:19:18,wallstreetbets,"Hey, its me

I have actually been following this company for a while (not super in depth or anything, just been watching developments) and just have a few concerns I'd point out:

1. This is a food company trading at a tech multiple, in a very - \*\*\*very -\*\*\*competitive space. Space on food shelves, let alone freezers, is very limited.
2. With that being said, there is nothing extremely unique around their product. Sure, they are ahead in product development, but I wouldn't be surprised if a big competitor comes in with 5x their market cap in R&D and blows these guys up
3. Their DTC is lacking, why are they're stores always out of stock? If demand for their product is really that high, why are they not producing more or increasing their capacity? They have a lot of cash on hand and virtually no debt, yet they aren't making any big moves. Sure the acquisition of the Mexico-based producer will help, but they seem to be focused on increasing their product line more than meeting demand.
4. This leads me to the next, is that what is required of this industry? yes, it is. You have to constantly be developing new products which can be a big cost in the future. They haven't even begun marketing campaigns and are reporting a negative cashflow. They're gross margin isn't bad, but BYNDs is 10-15% higher with far more brand recognition.
5. Lastly, they're DTC is always going to be tough. They are shipping mostly frozen products. This requires extra packaging etc. that bigger brands will be able to absorb better. The more facilities you have to ship from, the cheaper the cost.

Overall, I can see this company going somewhere in the future. But right now its pretty over valued for some of the (I think pretty notable) headwinds they face."
2021-06-15 17:10:58,wallstreetbets,"Absolutely not.

There are too many players in this market doing too much better. And they have actual IP to back them up. Beyond Meat and Impossible are vastly superior.

Here is a telling quote from TTCF's S-1:

""As of the date of this prospectus, we do not have any issued patents and have forgone pursuing any patent applications. As a result, we cannot rely on any protection provided under applicable patent laws""

That is a huge problem. The reason that Beyond Meat and Impossible are valuable is because they can create products that no one else is allowed to create. For Impossible, their compound that uses iron ions and heme to create a bloody/meaty taste blows the competition out of the water. For Beyond, they have patents focused more on replicating a more satisfying texture. These cannot be replicated without either R&D on alternatives, or by infringing a patent.

But TTCF has no degree of protection. Cauliflower Pizza is not new. It is very gay, but not very new. The same can be said of the entirety of their portfolio of products. It's all commodity food-stuffs that any competitor can do better.

The demand for Cauliflower Wings is not that fucking high. However, the demand for something that tastes like an actual burger, without the use of beef, is extraordinarily high.

That is the difference. I do not recommend shorting it. But it seems like it is not worthwhile to allocate funds on this."

I am just dabbling in calls. I am not risking much and am just trying to learn before I make a huge mistake.

So, I just bought 3 calls for TTCF.
7/16 $30c at $0.78 or $233.05
The stock hasn't moved much in the last few minutes. Can you explain to me why my current value is instantly $53.05 less than what I just paid? 

I don't care about the money, like I said, I am learning. I have noticed that every time I place an option for calls, this same things seems to happen.

Am I fucking this up somehow?

Thank you in advance for your help."
2021-06-15 13:57:01,wallstreetbets,"On TTCF's last earnings call, we learned that their product were the best-selling frozen foods in Target's history.

Also they are expanding from frozen foods to other types of food product as well."

2021-06-15 15:45:32,wallstreetbets,"IV stands for implied volatility, the option price depends both on the stock price and IV. When there is an expected drastic move, IV goes higher. Therefore, the stock could move down and the option could go up because IV is going up more than the stock price is going down. When there is less of an expected move, IV goes down, taking option price down with it"

2021-06-15 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Oatly is just getting started and ready to moon! #WHAT IS A OATLY?
According to [Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oatly): Oatly Group AB is a Swedish food company that produces alternatives to dairy products from oats.[1][2] A liter of Oatly product consumed in place of cow's milk results in around 80% less greenhouse gas emissions, 79% less land usage and 60% less energy consumption.[3] Oatly was formed in the 1990s using research from Lund University.[4][5][6] Oatly has headquarters in Malmö and a production and development center in Landskrona.[7][8][9][10][11] Oatly's key markets are Sweden, Germany and the U.K., and its products were available in 60,000 retail stores and 32,200 coffee shops around the world as of 31 December 2020.[12] Oatly can also be found in 11,000 coffee and tea shops in China, and at more than 6,000 retail and specialty shops across the country, including thousands of Starbucks locations. [12]               

#OAT MILK SOUNDS GROSS, NO WAY IT IS POPULAR: WRONG.           
Oat milk has been surging in popularity these last few years, and is now behind [Almond](https://www.fooddive.com/news/oat-milk-surges-to-second-most-popular-in-plant-based-dairy/586010/) milk. Covid has brought Oat Milk to an even [higher popularity](https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/12/10221842/oat-milk-rise-covid-willas-kitchen). Oatly has banked in this popularity and has gotten big named like [Jay-Z, Oprah,](https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/jul/14/oprah-winfrey-and-jay-z-tap-into-rising-alt-milk-star-oatly), and [Natalie Portman](https://thebeet.com/oprah-natalie-portman-and-jay-z-invest-200-million-in-oatly-oat-milk/) to invest over $200 million into them, through Blackrock and personal investments. [Howard  Schultz](https://www.wsj.com/articles/oat-milk-company-oatly-draws-investment-from-blackstone-led-group-including-oprah-11594701001) of Starbucks fame personally invested in the company.               

#OKAY OAT MILK IS POPULAR, BUT WHY OATLY AND NOT OTHER COMPANIES?         
Oatly has been around for over 20 years, so they already had everything ready to deal with the Oat Milk boom. It is this system that allowed them to partner with [Starbucks](https://stories.starbucks.com/press/2021/oatly-oatmilk-coming-to-starbucks-nationwide-in-the-us/). This has been so much of a success, [Starbucks](https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/06/business/starbucks-oat-milk-shortage/index.html) can’t keep up with the demand yet. So guess who has to buy more from Oatly. Who just opened up a farm in Utah to [help](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/starbucks-is-seeing-oat-milk-shortages-174509626.html) with the demand. This farm is already working, so no need to wait for construction.         

 Currently, Oatly sits at over [$12 billion ](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/5-things-to-know-about-oatly-stock-2021-05-27) and is showing no signs of slowing down. 
#OKAY OATLY IS POPULAR, BUT HOW IS THE STOCK?          
Oatly opened at [$17.22](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/20/business/oatly-stock-price-IPO.html) their first day on May 20th, and closed at over [$22](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/20/oatly-ipo-otly-starts-trading-on-nasdaq.html). Now Oatly sits over $27.  Price targets for Oatly range mostly from [$30-35](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/oatlys-business-strategy-is-the-main-reason-to-own-the-stock-truist-analysts-say-11623698513).          

#BUT THEY ONLY SELL OAT MILK?         
No, they sell yogurt, frozen yogurt, cooking oat milk stuff, and other [things](https://www.oatly.com/int/products)      

#BUT WHAT ABOUT THEIR LACK OF PROFIT?         
The lack of profit has been known for a long and was shown again when they filed for their IPO. [Oatly](https://www.foodnavigator-usa.com/Article/2021/05/20/Oatly-goes-public-opens-Utah-factory-We-are-going-to-prioritize-growth-over-profit-says-CEO) is focusing on expanding and is building more facilities around the globe as they currently sell around the globe, including [China](https://marketingtochina.com/oatly-another-swedish-success-story-in-china/). With current trends their profits are bound to moon.

|:-|:-|:-|
|Cash Reserves|9.51B ( 9Billions in cash )|518M|
|Long term debt|22.13B|9.68B|
|Total Assets|53.59B|45.06B|
|Total Liabilities|33.04B|19.69B|
|Total Equities (Total Assets - Total Liabilities )|20.56|25.37B|
|Total revenue |5.60B|20.83B|
|Gross profit |835M|12.91B|
|Diluted EPS|\-13.21|4.32|

Also, CCL has benefited from low-interest rate, they have been able to refinance old debt  [https://www.ft.com/content/ac9b39b4-05f9-44f2-a63f-d848a7b0495c](https://www.ft.com/content/ac9b39b4-05f9-44f2-a63f-d848a7b0495c)

&#x200B;

Just comparing with the 2019 EPS data and current cash reserves, they should pay off the debt in under 5 years.

2021-06-15 11:46:34,wallstreetbets,"The risk is that we still don’t know what their future revenues are. Currently ~80% of their customers want to go on a vaccine passport only cruise. Unfortunately, Texas and Florida the two major launch points have made vaccine passports illegal. Given that, what will the demand be going into the future? The US gov’t has shown it doesn’t care about the cruise industry as they don’t fly the US flag and aren’t domiciled in the US.
It is a pretty good high risk high return play though!

Edit: https://www.wsj.com/articles/cruise-lines-wrestle-with-florida-ban-on-vaccine-passports-11623587416 ""A recent survey of more than 5,000 readers of Cruise Critic, a popular review site, found that 80% of respondents preferred to sail on a ship with a vaccine requirement, while 13% preferred one without such a mandate.""

Considering the older age of the median cruise line passenger, this is a big headwind for the cruise industry."

Consider fl and tx the ones who are supplying for the people against those who dont want to need a passport just to go somewhere in their own state. Others require, those dont.

2021-06-15 18:10:49,wallstreetbets,"The point for CCL is that the vast majority of consumers seem to want VP. The vast majority of their  cruises currently leave from the US from Fl or TX. To change that would be costly and risky. 
You can say cater to both sides but when one side is larger and likely has more dollars to spend because of their overwhelming majority that side matters a ton more. 
Take your politics out of it and be the CCL CEO which would you prefer? Unless the polls are wrong and people in reality don’t care, the loss of the passport makes their already unclear cash flows even riskier. Do you have any argument against this?"
2021-06-15 19:36:25,wallstreetbets," *shrug* Ccl just needs to make a decision and commit to it. Crap or get off the pot. But dont just sit there going ""hmm"". What ever the decision is, ive been wanting to invest as well but not seeing any movement. Another cruise line is already out making money without the passport. Honestly, any movement, with or without, is going to be better than doing nothing. Im not against what they choose to do though as long as it follows the lines of whats allowed. Its their business. Im not going on any cruise ships though. Had a dream about being attacked by somali shit-pirates while on a cruise. They didnt rob or kill anyone.  They just smeared shit all over the walls of the ship. So theres that."

Jumped into some DD on $WELL $WLYYF and the Fundamentals are all lining up:

* Approaching $500M in Revenue and $100M in EBITDA
* Largest Clinic provider in Canada - Top 3 Telehealth Provider - One of the largest EMR databases - Aggressive expansion into the US through strategic M&A Activity and an upcoming Nasdaq IPO in Q4 with Fenwick & West.
* Just raised $305M at $9.80 (currently $7.76) - $105M of which was done by the 29th richest man in the world Mr. Li Ka Shing who is probably going to help them expand into Asia when the time is right - That alone will probably be worth more than all North American digital healthcare companies lmao.
* $500M in credit lines given by the largest bank in the US & the largest in Canada which they have used to fuel M&A activity.
* If I am looking at everything correctly, they financed all the recent acquisitions at $9.80 so I really don't see how it's not at that price right now.
* 20%+ Short Interest 

As for technicals, I'm no expert but looking at this chart it just found strong support on the 50day MA similar to what it did last year at $1.5 before immediately making a move to $9.

2021-06-15 11:26:55,wallstreetbets,"I had been in and out of RIDE since the beginning of December 2020. I have read every article and watched every video I could find on these electric trucks and the company, both the positive and the negative stuff.The tech is great. Each wheel has its own hub motor, so true all wheel drive, not with a differential that really only drives one front and one rear wheel at a time like 4WD. The truck can be driven in water 3 feet deep. They tested the hub motors ability to turn after they had frozen water on them for days. They are targeting fleet buyers with a more-basic truck for only $45,000 after the government tax credit, but it is a crew cab like most fleet buyers said they want, not a 3-seater. A couple of the crash tests have been passed on the beta trucks. We are still waiting for the results of additional tests. Some of the beta trucks are in the hands of potential buyers, like the camouflage one that went to the U.S. Army.Steve Burns brought us a great product, but I had never liked the messaging coming from management, which was often too vague or gloomier-than-necessary. Now they are getting new management.Lordstown Motors is holding their open house next week for institutional investors, media, fleet buyers and politicians to come see the factory, watch presentations, and test drive the trucks. Nothing to hide. That is confidence. We will all be able to watch that online as well on the 25th, 10 days from now.RIDE was just added to the Russell 2000 index, so lots of shares will be purchased this month due to that.The new interim CEO is telling us that production should still start in late September, the one 3 months from now, not years from now.On their last earnings call they said they now had 30,000 purchase orders, not just pre-orders, many who had paid deposits. That is $1.58B in sales so far. The demand is there.Yes, they need cash. Many successful startups have needed cash before. Lordstown Motors owns a gigantic plant they got from GM, so big that it produced 400,000 Chevy Cruz's per year. Without the need for a large motor line and transmission line, Lordstown Motors thinks the building has the capacity for about 600,000 per year eventually. They are debt free now, so getting an asset-based loan should not be difficult. Potential investors will be at the open house next week.Lastly, this stock is heavily shorted. I have never gone all-in on one thing before, but like we say here, YOU ONLY LIVE ONCE. Since buying these options I have been negative 76% and positive more than double, but I am looking for a gain of at least 400-500%, so I am hanging on."
2021-06-15 11:51:08,wallstreetbets,"This is the way If investors want more % on their money because its cheap right now. 

Not a financial advise."
2021-06-15 12:09:42,wallstreetbets, pretty much all stock plummeting right now or just the ones I invested in?...
2021-06-15 12:02:52,wallstreetbets,"The thing with $RIDE is that it will absolutely do 1 of 2 things -   
1)  go bankrupt  
2)  go to at least $20 in September when they start limited production  


So, will it be #1?  $GM owns 7.5M shares and has said they do not plan on selling.  All of the interim executives are being paid with shares.  Usually interim executives are paid cash, because they want to be paid if the company fails, working for shares is very bullish.    


Will production start in September?  the last CEO was forced out for overstating preorders and the new interim CEO has already stated that they will be starting production in September.  I don't think she would use her first company statement to repeat the sins of the CEO she just replaced.  


The only factor is capital.  They need additional capital to go into commercial production.  They have enough for limited production for September to the end of the year, but they need more for larger, commercial production next year.  


The company has $0 debt and more than $500M in cash/assets, there is little chance they will not be able to get an equity based loan (they have already stated no plans for dilution).  And once they do, the SP should go up significantly.  


One final thing, they are currently in due-diligence on an ATVM loan."

2021-06-15 11:26:05,wallstreetbets,Not a stock for the faint of heart.  I've owned this one for years.   Highly volatile.  Down nearly 5% today.  As far as I can tell based on copper futures which are also down.   As is the whole sector.
2021-06-15 12:12:41,wallstreetbets,"I'm sorry man, that was the time when it was hovering around the $250. Depending on how politics go, I think the stock will be between $25-$30 by the end of the year, maybe $100 by 2026-2027 when they hit full production after they complete the undercut. I'm here for the long run. We'll see. Just gonna let it there sit and forget about it, will check back in December."

2021-06-15 13:49:03,wallstreetbets,"Judging from your comment history you should have never tried investing, didn’t any sort of bell ring in your head when you had 10 losses in a row ( as you say) ? if you are so bad, why are you trading complex financial instruments like options and not bonds? Why didn’t you do your own research on things?

Zero psychological control, risk management or logic, just greed. And now you come to reddit to cry and ask on wsb how to make your money back.

You’d be better off gambling it all in one night.

I don’t want to beat you down further but someone had to tell you to work on your decision making in life, and do it urgently, what you are doing is not normal."

2021-06-15 12:23:24,wallstreetbets,"A «call» is an option contract for when you believe the price of the stock is going to rise. A «put» option is for when you believe the price will fall.

1x call option gives you the right to buy 100 shares at the strike price. Think of the strike price as the amount you have the right to buy the shares for, no matter how high the price might be in the future.

The option will only be available until the expiry date, you can chose to exercise (buy the shares at the strike price) the option before that, at any time you wish. Or simply sell the conteact to someone else for a good return.

The idea of it is to purchase the right to buy shares at a set price sometime in the future, which can yield pretty good returns, compared to regular trading of shares.

This is the extremely extreme basic gist of it, google can find you a lot more!"
2021-06-15 12:30:31,wallstreetbets,"Options are complicated. You need at least 1 week of learning to understand the basics. 

But in summary you buy a call option when you believe the price of a stock  will go up. 

Say the current price of $APES stock is $40, you can buy an OTM ( out of the money, you only make a profit when prices actually go above $55 factoring the premium) call for $55. This is just a contract that gives you the right and not the obligation to buy $APES at $55 on DTE( all call options have expiry date). And to buy a an option you pay a premium. See this as a fee for someone to keep $APES for you till the expiry.

To profit off an option, you can 

1. Exercise to buy the stock ( meaning you must have some cash. Also note a contract is for 100 units of stocks. In this case 100x $APES. So 2 contracts will give you 100 x 2 = 200 shares of $APES

2. Sell the contract to someone else. I believe most people take this option.

The opposite of this is called a put option. When you believe a stock is overvalued and will reduce  in price. In this call you buy a put option.

Here is a good YouTube video on Options 

https://youtu.be/fUZHmJAvN30"
2021-06-15 12:41:32,wallstreetbets,"Honestly my explanation sucks so just read this:

https://www.theoptionsguide.com/call-option.aspx

So there are a few things to consider. A single call is a call contract, it is a contract based on 100 shares. So the first thing to look at is the price, let's say it says $3.5, then the call contract will actually cost $350 because the price is shown per share within the call. The second thing is the strike price. The idea here is that the contract gives the holder the right to buy 100 shares from whoever wrote the contract, any time before the expiry date of the contract, for the strike price. For example, let's say the strike price is $10, and the expiry is July 30th and the cost is $3.5. You would pay $350 to have the right to buy 100 shares of the stock, at $10 a piece, from the issuer, before market close on July 30th.

What you want is for the stock to go up in value, as this increases the value of your calls and you know, buy low, sell high. Most people on here never exercise their calls (when you buy the stocks from the other party) they just sell them before they expire and pocket the difference in price from when they bought it. Calls have 2 values baked into them. The first is the potential for future profit, or Theta. Basically the more time before expiry the more value the theta tends to have, as there is potential for the stock to go up before expiry. As you get closer to expiry there is less time for the stock to move and this value drops off, called theta decay. The other value is simple, it's just the difference between the stock price and the strike price. If the strike is $10 and the stock is priced at $15, then there is a $5 value, as you can buy the stock with the call for $10 and sell it back to the market at $15 and pocket the difference. Since your contract is for 100 stocks then this is $500 worth of value.

Basically a call is a bet that the stock will be above the strike price by the expiry date. If the price is below the strike at the expiry the call expires worthless, meaning you get nothing. This is where the major difference compared to stocks, the contract doesn't have the same intrinsic value as a stock. If you buy a stock at $10 and think it's going to hit $15 and it only hits $14, you made 40%, if you buy call contract for $15 and it only hits $14, you lose whatever money you paid for it. The best way to look at it is that with a stock you're gains and losses are unrealized until you sell it, with a call whatever you paid for it is an immediately realized loss, and you hope that you make gains to counteract it. In the previous example, if the call expires and the stock is $15 and the strike is $15, you still spent the money to buy it, and made no money because there is no difference between the values. Basically calls are more risky and have a very real chance for 100% loss, but they have higher upside as when the stock moves above the strike price you mimic the profit of 100 shares often for far less initial investment, kinda like trading with margin."

**TL;DR**: Unilateral UK action could trigger EU retaliation, possibly leading to a trade war between the union and its former member state in which they would impose tariffs or other penalties on the flow of goods (most notably sausages).

[https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/agricultural/livestock/lean-hogs\_quotes\_globex.html#](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/agricultural/livestock/lean-hogs_quotes_globex.html#)

There is a linear correlation between the number of lean hogs needed and the number of sausages on the market. That’s what the scientists call mathematics. Also, the line is green, so it’s a good thing.

2021-06-15 11:39:10,wallstreetbets,"Lean hogs are cash settled. They also eat grain, look at the price of grain futures for an indicator of the cost to feed out a hog. FWIW I see ALL the farmers in my area planting corn this year instead of their usual summer crops, which is cool because I am raising 200 hogs this year and closer corn is nice.

I have been running a similar commodities idea through the paces with a fellow retard Wall Street gambler from work:

1. Buy a corn contract, if I lose money, take delivery.

2. If corn recovers, store the corn and deliver on expiration.

3. If corn continues to fall, sell a hog contract and feed all the corn to hogs.

I quickly realized this is no longer a futures speculation and it turned into a job, so now I’m a farmer."

Take a look, the TA framework of this thesis is fairly simple, is based on Fibonacci retracement, and incorporates 9 stages for both SPX 1987-2003 and 2009-2024. The Fibo measurement starts with the reversal of the previous downtrend (market crash ended) and covers the long term uptrends.

Fibonacci retracmenet is a very important instrument in TA, which is used with the purpose of measuring the prevailing market trend, identifying crucial support and resistance levels of it, and most importantly for forecasting potential corrective price action move. It is applied to the starting point of the trend and its apex - traditionally, but with the current example, it didn’t really fit well and I had to ‘think outside of the Fi-box’. That’s why I configured Fibo accordingly, taking into consideration how the price action interacts with the major supports/resistances on the charts. You may check yourself on the charts above, how well it all fits together with such a Fibo application, for BOTH of the charts.

So, dafaq is this false 0 level Fibo breakout, one may ask. This, my retarded friend, is a perfect example of a bull trap, which is happening simultaneously to the distribution market phase. And this is what is happening currently again, with all the “stonks only go up rhetorics”.

And what comes after 144 month bars / 4382 days long bull market + a bull trap?

That’s right, several fucking years bear market. 50 fucking percent retrace."

2021-06-15 11:19:55,wallstreetbets,"People that don't understand basic math.

Compound interest leads to an ever-accelerating curve.  This is natural.  Nothing based on percentage increases annually will look like a straight line over time.

Once in a while we get some black swans that push it down and restart the curve at a lower point.  This is fine, but actually pretty random.  This time IS different because EVERY time is different.  Mistakes get made, but never the same one twice unless your conspiracy-addled brain is drawing connections that aren't there.

As a thought exercise, make a chart in excel or whatever.

Start with $100 in 1950.  Give yourself an average market return of say 12% per year until now (you could make it 3% or 30%, it doesn't matter really).

Now look at that curve!  It's going to the moon! Holy shit!  Your account is gonna blow up!  Way too high!  Unsustainable!

The financial storm is brewing, and one has to be stupidly blind, or blindly stupid to not to see it coming.

When the markets are artificially supported by QE for too long, they eventually start to resemble a drugs addict, which can’t live without the always following stimulus “dose”.

2021-06-15 18:28:25,wallstreetbets,"Portfolio diversity: none.  100% AMC.  Noice.

I like movies."

2021-06-15 18:52:33,wallstreetbets,How did you happen to post right at the peak of the day?????
2021-06-15 18:52:44,wallstreetbets,"$62.55 is nothing compared to $500,000"
2021-06-15 18:55:06,wallstreetbets,Weird how that works.
2021-06-15 18:56:39,wallstreetbets,I'm sure you did.. 😂👍

2021-06-15 19:10:58,wallstreetbets,It goes up and down but sure AMC & GME 🚀🚀🚀
2021-06-15 19:16:39,wallstreetbets,wow i like how everyone here is now convinced now that they should have just stuck with AMC from day 1 lmao
2021-06-15 19:16:42,wallstreetbets,"Lets gooooo, ya love to see it"
2021-06-15 19:20:28,wallstreetbets,Guess you missed out on $trch

2021-06-15 13:16:37,wallstreetbets,$TR is next.  Massive short position.  Breaking out technically.
2021-06-15 13:57:43,wallstreetbets,"Anyone looked at Workhorse grp? 
Looks like a good play at the moment, short interest has been HUGE. Potential for a short squeeze is very good"
2021-06-15 13:43:15,wallstreetbets,Yeah….I wish GME was in the mix. It’s a dud since I got in too late in the game.
2021-06-15 13:03:33,wallstreetbets,Op was all in WISH yesterday
2021-06-15 13:24:14,wallstreetbets,This aged well
2021-06-15 14:15:42,wallstreetbets,You’re retarded $GME is the only play
2021-06-15 15:50:37,wallstreetbets,Don’t get too greedy. Level 2 shows big boys will sell at $110. Enjoy the ride up to $100.

2021-06-15 14:03:20,wallstreetbets,Clearly AMC did got the message to take a dive today.
2021-06-15 14:05:03,wallstreetbets,Omg another robinhood noob🥱😑
2021-06-15 14:21:36,wallstreetbets,And down and up and down and up
2021-06-15 14:22:36,wallstreetbets,"Nah, I sold last week at 62.55. I don't care if it gamma squeezes, I made my money an I doubt we will see much more than that if it does."
2021-06-15 14:28:34,wallstreetbets,you will feel like a clown when it drops
2021-06-15 14:29:53,wallstreetbets,Don’t spend it al on one place
2021-06-15 14:30:08,wallstreetbets,Thought I'd check in see how you're doing after that amazing play you made at the worst possible timing.
2021-06-15 15:13:53,wallstreetbets,"Hold guys, to 150$ at Friday it’s possible?"
2021-06-15 16:53:57,wallstreetbets,25K in and made a hundred bucks and posts about it. Thats the kind of stupidity I like to see!
2021-06-15 17:08:05,wallstreetbets,Each of you send me $10.00 or so help me God..I'll buy 500 shares and it will tank the very next day.
2021-06-15 17:57:17,wallstreetbets,"About an hour ago, InvestorPlace said AMC is not worth $31 billion, and to sell your shares NOW."
2021-06-15 18:51:25,wallstreetbets,Don't talk about meme stocks when you are using Robinhood 🙄
2021-06-15 18:57:41,wallstreetbets,Just another bag holder. RIP to this guy SOON LOL!!!!!!
2021-06-15 19:49:31,wallstreetbets,We are all apes! No matter how many you have! We all hold for each other!
2021-06-15 11:31:05,wallstreetbets,He ain't scared
2021-06-15 11:57:54,wallstreetbets,At least he didn't fomo. He can't lose money with that average.
2021-06-15 12:29:48,wallstreetbets,"Even though I've only got 200 shares I feel pretty proud for getting in at 13.00.  
For once I didn't FOMO at the peak.  


Yay me."

2021-06-15 12:01:28,wallstreetbets,The floor is 500k. OP got in cheap.
2021-06-15 12:02:33,wallstreetbets,Let’s see how it works out for him
2021-06-15 14:02:02,wallstreetbets,Right I’m in since $7 with and average of around 10 with xxx shares. This dude has nuts made of diamonds
2021-06-15 14:05:33,wallstreetbets,Pennies in the grand scheme of things my fellow ape 🚀🚀🚀
2021-06-15 16:31:41,wallstreetbets,"I saw people saying that about a guy buying in at 19, there's plenty more room to move this baby"
2021-06-15 16:38:35,wallstreetbets,the best trades to double down on are winning ones!
2021-06-15 17:28:13,wallstreetbets,"I love amc and believe in it, but I would not buy over 50. I don't even think I would've bought over 20. There was a long slow trend downward year over year before the pandemic. I expect a resurgence obviously, but I don't expect it to last."
2021-06-15 11:00:08,wallstreetbets,"I thought mine was bad. I sold all my AMC like a week ago, then ended up puting half the profits back in at 55."
2021-06-15 11:24:49,wallstreetbets,This guy really is buying the rip. God's speed to him...but I reckon AMC will be back at $50 before the end of the week. (I am always wrong though)
2021-06-15 14:57:24,wallstreetbets,thats what donkey\_fomo looks like
2021-06-15 16:36:07,wallstreetbets,"Right? wtf, lol"
2021-06-15 18:25:28,wallstreetbets,Selling calls makes it kinda worth it
2021-06-15 18:43:58,wallstreetbets,A true AMC retard
2021-06-15 19:04:31,wallstreetbets,Two digits is a BUY.
2021-06-15 13:40:20,wallstreetbets,And lack of “diversity”. Not going to end well.
2021-06-15 17:20:59,wallstreetbets,He should have bought in at 12.46 months ago like I did
2021-06-15 19:24:59,wallstreetbets,"You got a whole “heuhahahahaha” out of me. It was an involuntary, weird, weird sound."
2021-06-15 13:24:24,wallstreetbets,I’m ready to say what job?
2021-06-15 13:16:20,wallstreetbets,Add me to the list good sirs
2021-06-15 13:45:34,wallstreetbets,"If I make 1$ on this stock, I'll quit. **goes up 1$** ""say no more fam"""
2021-06-15 12:34:15,wallstreetbets,Me too dude
2021-06-15 17:06:45,wallstreetbets,in at 1 share at 17 i feel any gain is a good gain!
2021-06-15 14:35:51,wallstreetbets,The supply of greater fools is running low.
2021-06-15 14:23:57,wallstreetbets,ya tuff day in the market
2021-06-15 18:40:36,wallstreetbets,I suspect market makers / HFs are selling off large positions to combat AMC. It’s a huge week for them as we have thousands of options contracts in the money currently and a lot more at $60. Those will trigger MILLIONS of shares they have to buy back.
2021-06-15 12:31:47,wallstreetbets,70 is nothing compared to what will happen if we all hold.
2021-06-15 15:09:29,wallstreetbets,Fr. This sub has been taken over by shills at this point. Anyone who actually knows what’s going on w GME rn knows it’s a fucking steal at this price but its been all quiet on this sub for weeks. I don’t normally tinfoil hat and I’ve been on this sub for years but lately it’s become a little sus...
2021-06-15 19:17:10,wallstreetbets,"I’m all in on AMC but i hope for the best for gamestop, just need to get that volume up"
2021-06-15 14:11:44,wallstreetbets,"why is that? cause im worried


Edit, notice the culture here of me raising doubt and politely asking why gets me downvoted. The fact that you guys can't even have a normal debate or discussion over these topics shows you're close minded. Even if someone came with a good reason why gme will fail you wouldn't listen. So you have very little credibility now"
2021-06-15 12:57:31,wallstreetbets,Yeah bro look at it go
2021-06-15 14:21:15,wallstreetbets,You in your mum's car?
2021-06-15 12:27:09,wallstreetbets,I love when Im scrolling thru comments and one like yours pops up and I giggle out loud af.. love it.
2021-06-15 12:11:55,wallstreetbets,I think the bar is just how retarded this play is
2021-06-15 12:31:42,wallstreetbets,He bought $25k worth of AMC at ATH lol
2021-06-15 16:37:57,wallstreetbets,"Retards gonna retard, and I think that’s the bar. He bought $25,000 worth of AMC at $62 average lol."
2021-06-15 13:09:08,wallstreetbets,It’s a YOLO post
2021-06-15 13:52:13,wallstreetbets,It says YOLO…
2021-06-15 14:08:32,wallstreetbets,This sub has gone so far downhill
2021-06-15 14:07:56,wallstreetbets,They gotta keep the narrative away from GME somehow 🤷🏻‍♂️
2021-06-15 10:23:40,wallstreetbets,Correct bby 😎🙌💎
2021-06-15 12:33:30,wallstreetbets,I'm ready to buy more!!
2021-06-15 14:09:48,wallstreetbets,And down to 59
2021-06-15 17:34:02,wallstreetbets,Seriously. I see a lot of people still on it. Like have you been under a rock this whole time?
2021-06-15 18:39:33,wallstreetbets,Took me a day and a half for the transfer. Was really easy. No excuses
2021-06-15 19:25:35,wallstreetbets,"WeBull good, yes?"
2021-06-15 12:57:35,wallstreetbets,This whole sub is full of shills. They pump a new stock each day. Talk about market manipulation
2021-06-15 13:01:31,wallstreetbets,Anyone who talks about short interest on a stock that is only 30% shorted doesn’t know what they’re taking about. The true short plays are AMC and GME and maybe stuff like BBBY.
2021-06-15 13:45:08,wallstreetbets,"Look at his account, he bought 25k in WISH yesterday, it was 100% of his portfolio, so he sold all that to buy AMC at the peak? And in his comment history they’re saying they were buying WOOF today, and talking about  PLTR like they have own some of that too, but AMC is 100% of their portfolio. Smells fishy to me."
2021-06-15 16:43:50,wallstreetbets,"Not too late, I put 800 in today at 63 bucks, because why the hell not lol. Go for it, we can be morons together :)"
2021-06-15 14:02:52,wallstreetbets,it’s clearly a meme stock wdym 😂
2021-06-15 10:42:51,wallstreetbets,100k*
2021-06-15 16:19:01,wallstreetbets,Hey fack you leave my baby AMC alone! She’ll move when she’s ready :)
2021-06-15 10:52:40,wallstreetbets,Too quiet 🤮 I need to buy another 100 shares
2021-06-15 13:05:06,wallstreetbets,The ceiling is a little lower than whatever people think it will be. All shareholders claim the ceiling to be higher than the price they hope to get out at as there needs to be a reason for someone else to buy their shares.
2021-06-15 15:14:20,wallstreetbets,I thought you bought back in at $53?
2021-06-15 13:31:55,wallstreetbets,Jups
2021-06-15 16:26:51,wallstreetbets,"I agree, im looking to get in around 180 - 185 but GME is looking bullish it just doesnt have the momentum and short term gain potential as AMC right now."
2021-06-15 10:37:31,wallstreetbets,"Exactly, they are trying to dilute us from the REAL WINNERS"
2021-06-15 10:50:05,wallstreetbets,WISH isn’t a meme stock lol. The average is about $20/share. It’s this low cause of the meme pump and dumb. So it’s a good time to buy for the long term
2021-06-15 16:49:51,wallstreetbets,Look at you go lol
2021-06-15 15:11:06,wallstreetbets,Erm...2 weeks ago it was 32.
2021-06-15 13:44:58,wallstreetbets,$66
2021-06-15 14:24:06,wallstreetbets,Don’t. Need huge price movements to make money due to the high IV
2021-06-15 16:42:18,wallstreetbets,I bought at 63 today and it instantly went down to 59 and basically stayed there. So between us we've effectively range limited the poor stock. Sorry all!
2021-06-15 17:01:17,wallstreetbets,Guaranteed to go Right
2021-06-15 19:15:36,wallstreetbets,$180 is pennies
2021-06-15 13:51:55,wallstreetbets,Nice try
2021-06-15 13:37:50,wallstreetbets,scared money don't make money
2021-06-15 17:01:49,wallstreetbets,Obviously not.. mans on RH
2021-06-15 15:48:12,wallstreetbets,Neva scared
2021-06-15 15:54:18,wallstreetbets,Retards usually arnt
2021-06-15 17:22:23,wallstreetbets,He's part of the G-unit
2021-06-15 17:32:22,wallstreetbets,But he is retarded.
2021-06-15 14:12:58,wallstreetbets,What do you mean? He's already down.
2021-06-15 14:40:17,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I held at 13 for a while. Sold when it hit 13 again thinking it was going to fall once more like it did march (I wanted to get in again lower) and panicked as I saw it start climbing and got back in ten cents MORE expensive than my original purchase but still in the 13s haha and I thought I was a sucker for doing that.

Now here we are bout to make 60s again haha"
2021-06-15 14:06:31,wallstreetbets,"My average cost was below $10, been in since January. Been panic buying more the past couple weeks tho & brought my average up to $31 :))"
2021-06-15 16:12:10,wallstreetbets,"I bought 100 shares at $4 avg cost a few months ago, then sold them 10 minutes later thinking “this is fucking stupid, gamestop make sense but who the fuck goes to movies anymore, this is just a dumb meme pump n dump” guess im the retarded one"
2021-06-15 14:15:22,wallstreetbets,Bro just average up it's really fun
2021-06-15 14:22:56,wallstreetbets,$13 Crew here.
2021-06-15 15:11:43,wallstreetbets,Got in early then sold… just got back in for $62 🤦‍♀️
2021-06-15 15:29:55,wallstreetbets,"I had 500@12 and paperhanded at 15. Week after it it 70
xDDDDDDDDD"
2021-06-15 14:08:48,wallstreetbets,pretty sure this will seem like a good deal once we break past $70
2021-06-15 13:27:57,wallstreetbets,It’s a bold move.
2021-06-15 12:30:18,wallstreetbets,I'd bet very well.
2021-06-15 11:30:36,wallstreetbets,"could you please explain what the word ""sold"" means??? APE no understand"
2021-06-15 14:55:38,wallstreetbets,I hope you know accounts that perform the best are owned by people that are dead or forget about their accounts. Maybe you could try one of those.
2021-06-15 11:36:33,wallstreetbets,"Hey, I have a friend who is constantly saying AMC will fall and I should have taken profit at 70. All I said was, ""DIAMOND HAND IS UNBREAKABLE."" and I'm in full on greed mode."
2021-06-15 11:40:17,wallstreetbets,I don’t think anything can stop this stock from exploding. Matter of time .
2021-06-15 14:57:17,wallstreetbets,It costs nothing to hold
2021-06-15 11:29:19,wallstreetbets,Definitely buying the rip. RIP

2021-06-15 14:18:25,wallstreetbets,Have you seen the daily volume? The entire float is turned over almost every day lol.
2021-06-15 19:11:15,wallstreetbets,I'm happy as fuck GME is back near $200 now that I have money agian
2021-06-15 16:25:05,wallstreetbets,So true!!!!!
2021-06-15 15:51:39,wallstreetbets,Read the DD

2021-06-15 14:25:26,wallstreetbets,My semi actually 😂
2021-06-15 17:02:52,wallstreetbets,ATH is over $70
2021-06-15 14:31:58,wallstreetbets,Go start your own sub then. With hookers and blackjack.
2021-06-15 14:29:00,wallstreetbets,"I’m AMC all in, both will squeeze, show some appreciation at the very least broski, if GME squeeze first then AMC will follow or other way around. APE NO HATE APE."
2021-06-15 14:16:07,wallstreetbets,Still a win from 41 to 59 only in five days
2021-06-15 19:48:23,wallstreetbets,"Yes.

2021-06-15 19:45:10,wallstreetbets,Good decision
2021-06-15 15:14:24,wallstreetbets,[removed]
2021-06-15 13:23:08,wallstreetbets,You have no idea what you're talking about. This particular stock has been a battleground since January for good reasons.
2021-06-15 13:23:02,wallstreetbets,"So if you know it’s a pump and dump, just get out before the dump for free money. Idk how this is so hard for you people."
2021-06-15 15:53:23,wallstreetbets,I am loving it. So easy to detect and so easy to make money off of
2021-06-15 14:38:32,wallstreetbets,"AMC has low short interest, high liquidity, and a lot of these shorters borrowed shares over $60."
2021-06-15 19:36:00,wallstreetbets,CLOV Is the most shorted with an actual business model that makes sense in a growth industry and have zero debt to start out with.
2021-06-15 16:20:43,wallstreetbets,lets just say good thing you can day trade over 25k :) I can post positions once I post profit on this play.
2021-06-15 14:19:12,wallstreetbets,My farts smell way worse
2021-06-15 16:21:48,wallstreetbets,"Also, I can say with certainty that I think AMC out of any meme stock has the current best outlook on pumpamentals. Check out my DD."
2021-06-15 14:10:46,wallstreetbets,your moms a meme stock
2021-06-15 17:14:56,wallstreetbets,"She did bud, 100% last week"
2021-06-15 16:44:57,wallstreetbets,Today was $63. Sold at $53
2021-06-15 16:42:04,wallstreetbets,"I don’t hate on any people holding AMC, I’m actually rooting for you guys too. I just don’t agree with the mentality that GME is dead because of the lack of publicity and constant suppression of the stock"
2021-06-15 13:54:45,wallstreetbets,Goodluck retard - hope it hits - you already set a limit sell?
2021-06-15 15:29:09,wallstreetbets,Okay. Not sure what IV means but thank you!
2021-06-15 13:57:28,wallstreetbets,That's what I told myself on the toilet this morning lol
2021-06-15 14:01:45,wallstreetbets,I've doubled my portfolio in 6 months by doing only risky investments. It's not like I'm Mr moneybags but it's a start.
2021-06-15 13:51:45,wallstreetbets,Truer words have never been spoken
2021-06-15 13:52:55,wallstreetbets,It's actually quite amazing how many people don't understand this in life.
2021-06-15 15:52:31,wallstreetbets,"Yes, but un-scared money often loses money.

Source: OP has now lost money"
2021-06-15 14:27:00,wallstreetbets,"for example, I had an AMC 5-point call spread that expired in 2022

wtf am I going to do, wait a year so I can get a max of $500? fuck that, I can close for $425 today and find something else to do"

2021-06-15 19:24:38,wallstreetbets,Brought mine up to 40$ today. I first bought in at 5$. O well.
2021-06-15 15:46:35,wallstreetbets,"I figure even without the possibility of a squeeze, AMC is just now starting to open up, movies are just now starting to be released.  And apparently other theaters have closed down leaving AMC in a strong position.    


And while a lot of people point out that many prefer streaming, etc.  the fact is that some movies are best watched in the theatres.  And I don't think blockbuster films will ever lose mainstream theater watchability.

2021-06-15 11:50:42,wallstreetbets,Of course. Because HF are likely riding the momentum and buying AMC (and other recent meme runs) to hedge against GME. The incoming downvotes won’t take away that it’s the logical conclusion.

2021-06-15 14:33:14,wallstreetbets,GME floating shares is a fraction of AMC's. they both could squeeze yeah.. but GME is the true infinity squeeze play.

2021-06-15 17:47:17,wallstreetbets,Well this sub only talks about it when it goes up and even then 50% are negative comments about amc

I almost bough clov when it was 21, and that day it opened to 28....now is about 14.

&#x200B;

Will it come up again...maybe, but yeah, the real play is and always was GME....and maybe interesting too AMC and BB, but i also suspects they are kid of distractions.

2021-06-15 19:47:34,wallstreetbets,"Pretty sure CLOV is in the 30s. Remember, GME was 140% shorted. 30% isn’t too out of the ordinary considering retail can short stocks too. I’m not saying it’s a bad play and by all means looks like a great one."

2021-06-15 19:19:21,wallstreetbets,"lol I'm not saying that, a lot of it is trading algorithms making money for hedge fund and other market movers trading the fluctuations. But days to cover is under a day I think. Short interest around 20% and those that are left are either well dug in or have a high enough cost basis they won't be shaken out easily. Meanwhile the retail frenzy is losing steam a bit I think. 

It could fomo back up to $70 for an interday high but I don't see it staying above there for long."
2021-06-15 19:08:45,wallstreetbets,Except there is actual DD to look up instead of linking a stupid YouTube video with a no name fuck head spewing nonsense. They should've linked it though imo

The fact that GME and AMC are still holding on is because they both have cult like followings so the dump takes longer as desperate bagholders keep doubling down."

No, you can't.  Becuase they can't.  They might have a big screen to be sure.  But in no way does the spectacle match that of a theater.    It can't come close unless you're rich as shit.

There is also this crazy thing where people enjoy the social outing aspect of it.  I don't. Maybe you don't.  

But you know....normies.   The same normies who aren't rich as shit.  They have this weird thing in their brain where they like the social aspect of going out to places.  Even moreso post Covid.  I mean hell, movie studios learned just how much releasing a lot of movies to home streaming totally shit the bed for them.  Clearly it's not the same.

But it's the same reason you could make food at home that surpasses the restaurant experience.

2021-06-15 19:14:12,wallstreetbets,"Have you considered that sometimes failing companies hire impressive new tech execs as a form of a Hail Mary- a last ditch effort to survive? And that they often fail anyway. 

Maybe a retail company that: has a business model that isn’t consumer friendly (offering pennies on the dollar for used games often to resell them for nearly the retail price), is disliked by the industry whose product they sell (used game sales is bad for developers as it generates 0 additional revenue for them), and is quickly becoming less relevant due to increased digital purchases (which will continue as high speed internet access permeates further into the heartland), etc. isn’t set up for success in the modern world. And they hire new execs hoping to turn that around- but that’s a far cry from assuming they *will* turn it around.

This blind faith is gross. When the original DD for GME came out, I agreed it might be undervalued. That was at a market cap more than an order of magnitude below its current one, and you bag holders are waiting for it to go up another order of magnitude or more. It’d be funny if it wasn’t so sad."

2021-06-15 14:21:09,wallstreetbets,"Personally, I’m not selling until I know shorts have covered. Even if I sell after the actual squeeze, once shorts cover I think AMC will easily be well over $1,000 per share. I am personally thinking $10,000+ per share is possible, even tho theoretically it CAN get to $500k per share oe higher, but idk. Even after I sell I’ll still hold at least 50 shares in case it does goes crazy to 100k or 500k 

There’s no date for when that will happen, this Friday 6/18 might be huge, but it also might not be much of a difference either. I have no expectations for Friday & I hope no one else expects that to be the day either, then be disappointed when/if it’s not anything crazy."

2021-06-15 19:25:03,wallstreetbets,"I think there is just too much action for something like that. But given the volume short traders won't be trapped / forced out of their positions, so the only buyers are retail FOMO. FOMO is strong when price is going up but gets progressively weaker if the momentum drops. That's part of why you get such huge price swings with AMC. If FOMO ever evaporates dramatically then you have the millions of retail bagholder scenario.

There is literally no way for every retail holder to make it out of AMC near all time highs IMHO. Maybe for 20% it can happen but for the rest...."
2021-06-15 19:02:28,wallstreetbets,"Sometimes I can’t tell if I’m on WSB or a QAnon board. The two groups sound identical. If you question their premise then you’re a shill or in with the baddies or something. If you present information counter to their views they dismiss it. If you ask for their reasoning/justification they tell you to “read the DD” which is equivalent to “do your research.” So now I’m wondering if the same people chasing nonsense memestocks are also QAnoners, or if it’s just two groups of people that happen to lack critical thinking, enjoy feeling like they’re digital warriors fighting the system, and like being part of their little club. The overlap in the way they talk/behave is impressive though."

2021-06-15 19:54:41,wallstreetbets,"Why is that everyone’s default reply? I didn’t randomly make my comment out of the blue- you made the claim that “dying companies don’t hire all new execs” and I’m pointing out why that reasoning is inaccurate. If you can’t articulate an informed response, why even bother replying?

GME is overvalued like crazy right now. The fact that nobody is on here justifying the current market cap, let alone one significantly higher, should be evidence of that. I don’t care if dumb people want to throw away their money, that’s fine, but when people like you make absurd claims, rather than cheer on the nonsense I’m simply pointing it out. At this point what this sub is doing is borderline predatory- you need new dumb money buying/holding to keep the price inflated to keep your investments above water so you encourage this shit. It’s gross. It’s exploitive. It’s basically a pyramid scheme at this point because the stock is priced so far beyond the underlying business value that the only way to make money is by finding a new group of bag holders since GME will never have revenues to justify the market cap you need."

What are they going to do pivot to? an online game marketplace? Well too bad that's already owned by steam and unreal lol There is absolutely no way they can complete with a digital marketplace at this time and that was their main income for years which is gone lol. 

Before all this everyone hated gme because they'd give you 50 cents for selling them a game you just bought form them for 60$ lol nothing's changed aside from retards pumping it up."
2021-06-15 17:46:04,wallstreetbets,"Your TA says you only care about AMC, but less than 24 hours ago you were going to buy WOOF lmao, but in your post you make it seem like the opposite."

2021-06-15 15:53:41,wallstreetbets,"Nope, selling at 500+ was still the golden ticket, several months later"
2021-06-15 14:42:41,wallstreetbets,"Yes, but I actually started writing calls and puts to hedge my losses during this dip."
2021-06-15 16:36:59,wallstreetbets,"This is the prevailing attitude until one has progressed into trading maturity. Opening winning trades and then holding them until they are losing ones is a hallmark of beginning traders.

To stop doing this, and become a dick big swinging ape, read ""Trading in the Zone"" by Mark Douglas, until memorized."
2021-06-15 15:26:15,wallstreetbets,Obviously you don't know the DD. Your telling me you'd sell out for a fraction of the percent you could make on GME?
2021-06-15 19:23:24,wallstreetbets,Shhhhhh!!! Let them keep buying my calls.
2021-06-15 14:40:09,wallstreetbets,"its ok, i sold at 70, bought at 55, now where here."

No need to try & get random ppl to pump the stock, I’m a nobody on the internet & me making a few comments on Reddit won’t change the stock price whatsoever 😂"
2021-06-15 15:48:15,wallstreetbets,"Your posting history is fascinating, it's nothing but telling everybody else on wsb that they are morons.  It's almost as if you're nothing but a boring troll that nobody gives a flying f about."
2021-06-15 19:31:22,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I've been burned a few times on AMC puts lol. I'd suggest avoiding unless you have a high risk tolerance. 

The retards holding out for 100k a share will just be the bagholders. To them the dream of 100k some day is probably worth more than the $60 they paid for the share anyway. :)"
2021-06-15 16:57:38,wallstreetbets,So short it
2021-06-15 17:52:47,wallstreetbets,"Momentum trading buddy, share your all time let’s see whose is higher"
2021-06-15 17:27:50,wallstreetbets,"You should start learning just using small amounts of money. It's really easy. So for example instead of buying 400 shares at $62 (putting $25000 on the table) you could buy 4x call contracts 7/2 expatriation $62 strike for \~$1500 per contract, total of \~$6000.

The most you could lose would be $6000 even if AMC went to $0. But AMC would need to rise > $77 by 7/2 before you made any profit. Because you're paying $15 per share in premium for the option to buy that share for $62 on 7/2 or before.

Usually what people do is buy out of the money options for much better premiums. For example an $80 strike 7/2 contract is $10.80 per share, or if you do real short term like expiring this week $2.12 per share, or $6 per share for a $60 strike.

Given the high price of the AMC calls right now buying the shares maybe is the smartest move along with a stop loss or maybe put contract to hedge them. It all depends on when you expect the price to move and how far. My fear would just be a flash crash and AMC tumbles back down in the 30s before your stop loss order fills."
2021-06-15 16:44:09,wallstreetbets,Lol its not done yet
2021-06-15 16:39:11,wallstreetbets,I don't need to read a book to tell me I should cash out a 1000+% gain!

Are you going to sit here and tel me that $WISH is a bad stock, but $AMC, $GME and fucking $BB are good stocks!? Absolutely not, they’ve been pumped up due to nothing but internet hype. The same thing can and should happen with $WISH, it’s in a very similar position."

>""While not ideal, in a worst case scenario, an SBTech issue would not necessarily interfere with betting operations today,"" he added. ""We would use today’s weakness as an opportunity ahead of potential Canada legalization as well as New York, both of which are catalysts for DraftKings."""

Arizona sports betting deal approved by “Department of Interior, now legal in state. You can now legally gamble on sporting events and fantasy sports in Arizona. ... Online fantasy sports operations like DraftKings can piggyback on the licenses.”

This is a professional family guy and not some degenerate.  This is the future.  People want to put $5 on their team…just look at the success of fantasy football.  DraftKings is going to be a huge moneymaker.

Some dummy on CNBC just said they don’t know how it will become a profitable business.  If it wasn’t profitable why would Las Vegas, NJ, and the illegal bookies keep doing it?  They do it because it is incredible profitable for the house….which is DraftKings in this case.

2021-06-15 14:14:51,wallstreetbets,"Why is DraftKings so good? Legitimate question. 

I used DraftKings to mess around for last years nba finals and I found it to be completely fucking stupid. The winners in every single game I played picked totally random players who normally don’t do shit and had a career day. Every winner I personally saw was completely reliant on multiple instances of these anomalies. If you picked sensibly, there were 1,000 other people who did the same thing. So I ended up out of the money more often than not and even in the games I ended up in the money I only won a small amount compared to my initial bet. I find the single game fantasy format a total fucking sham. Takes zero skill unless some degenerate is out there with a fucking algorithm playing multiple rosters per game. Anyways, then I tried to open a Sportsbook account and it said that I can’t in my state. Many other states also do not allow it. So why is DraftKings such a good play when it’s Sportsbook is illegal in most of the country and it’s flagship product is a complete piece of shit? Are retards really spending shit tons of money playing these completely fucking stupid daily fantasy bullshit games?"

I don't know why Hindenburg chose DKNG because, frankly, who gives a shit if people are gambling illegally.  It happens all the time.  DKNG is still a leader in online gambling and has partnerships with the major professional leagues and the big casinos.  But, that doesn't mean Hindenburg's research is wrong, Im just not sure why anyone would care that the allegations are true.  The fact that retards on this sub think its bullshit that you can do research and decide to short a stock is stupid.  This sub was never about fighting short sellers.

2021-06-15 14:28:19,wallstreetbets,"The easy answer is yet, tons of people are throwing money at DraftKings and FanDuel and under the table with Yahoo and other sites playing with and against their friends at picking players to do random heroic things in sporting events.  A lot. 

Partially, it's the only legal gambling you can find in most of the US.  It's social and you can get your friends involved and also potentially win a lot of money, so there's that too.  

I've always found it fairly easy to make decent money on the fantasy sports aspect of these sites, it DOES take an algorithm but once you figure out your spreadsheet loads you're kind of going to have a real good shot at topping some boards.  People like to feel invested in the sports they watch, I couldn't have cared less about the NFL... but it sure was fun to watch knowing I had a thousand bucks on the line in a game between two teams I cared fuck all about in the end.  

Seems like a pretty dumb thing to invest in though, they're just one scandal or bad law away from hitting the shitter.  Poker was legal in the US until it suddenly wasn't.  Fantasy sports and sportsbook gambling could go poof in an instant if some other dumbshit conservative government gets voted in and starts getting big dick morals all over the country that didn't ask for it."
2021-06-15 14:19:43,wallstreetbets,"I would agree with you, the DFS tournaments are suckers bets, unless you are doing it head on head or in a small group. Atleast from what I see, most people use the online sports betting for betting on actual sporting events (spread/total points)."
2021-06-15 14:49:18,wallstreetbets,"Part of the answer is the sportsbook is going to be legalized in much of the U.S. and Canada.  The other answer is, well, let me make an analogy:

I go to a casino and play poker on the tables with bad players I can win money from and I have no clue why anyone would play a slot machine or 95% of these other tables games.  And yet, the casino would not survive if everyone was like me.  Everyone is also not like you.  For everyone who thinks like you do, there are 1,000 morons willing to gamble and, since they are morons, they actually PREFER to play games with less skill and more luck. These people LOVE fantasy games and sports betting since there is more luck involved (at least short term), and that is one reason they are a better business.  If they only ran leagues that required skill, they would go out of business."

What?  It's more efficient than setting a low price that then goes astronomical the first day, making the bankers behind the IPO rich.  Perhaps I'm wrong, but I'd bet that way more of the money goes to the company with SPAC than with IPO."

2021-06-15 14:31:36,wallstreetbets,You sound pretty late to the game 😂 Gme made me a millionaire months ago.
2021-06-15 13:10:08,wallstreetbets,Right because you know how Much money I have from my one position🤣. Let’s see the big account pussy boyyyyy
2021-06-15 13:39:34,wallstreetbets,I lost $90 but glad I sold when I did because that shit tanked. Holding my draft kings though I think long term this report won’t matter. Like anyone playing fantasy sports gives a shit about this.
2021-06-15 16:05:44,wallstreetbets,Lol this guy lost 67% of his account last year in the easiest year to trade of all time. I think you should get out
2021-06-15 16:45:12,wallstreetbets,You said if I had a brain I would have bought puts. That’s implying it’s easy. “ oh why didn’t you just do this durhhhh” why didn’t you? Let’s see your account.  Come on. Let’s see who’s had better y/y gains loud mouth.
2021-06-15 15:00:06,wallstreetbets,"until they don't.  

Full Tilt could still operate a poker site today if they wanted, the laws were against the money holding and processing.  Not the gambling.  Anything can change in a fucking instant when shitbag casino owners decide it's time to find a loophole and drop the hammer.  If a multi-billion dollar casino operator decided tomorrow to figure out how to put DraftKings out of business, they could do it without attacking the fact that FanDuel and Draft Kings can operate and perform gambling services.  And then all the money would go poof.  Again. 

It's a fucking stupid investment while America is still half-controlled by special interests and people who exude puritanical nonsense while taking hundreds of thousands of dollars in ""contributions"" from conflicting interests.  Sheldon Adelson being dead helps a LOT since he was the majority reason why poker got the crackdown in the first place, but there's no reason to think everything's above board and safe with DraftKings or FanDuel just because one thing went their way so far.  All it takes is another Internet Gambling Act where the money floats on the against side istead of in favor of the gambling portion of these sites to take them down.  

Do you trust the US Government?  I sure as fuck don't.  They still haven't given me back the money they took from my poker accounts so I'm sure not going to find a reason to give them more."
2021-06-15 16:30:11,wallstreetbets,"They dont make money because they are over spending on advertisement to acquire market share, they are trying to be the last one standing and their strategy could very well work. They also have money coming from other lenders. Disney owns 6% of draft kings.....ESPN. They are playing the long game and I think they will be one of the major sportsbooks left standing after the dust settles."
2021-06-15 14:33:46,wallstreetbets,"Ah fair enough, i was just commenting on the gambling aspect, I have no idea about DKNGs financials tbf"
2021-06-15 19:04:14,wallstreetbets,"They're spending a shitload to gain market share.  Long term whoever owns the bulk of the market share will arguably take the industry. 

I own them and Penn, Penn is going the other route of not actually shelling out bit money but they're lagging behind dkng and FanDuel on market share."

2021-06-15 15:40:17,wallstreetbets,"The point is Full Tilt was never given a nod of approval, and in fact, they knew it was illegal for U.S. banks to knowingly transfer $ to them on behalf of U.S. customers for poker, hence the reason why those deposits never showed up as “Full Tilt Poker Deposit” on your bank statement, but was some shady sh&$@ like “5755 Entertainment  - Nigeria” or some other random crap.

This is a whole different ballgame when FanDual ans DraftKings have full bipartisan support and a legal ruling from the Supreme Court on their side, and now THEY are a part of the corrupt machine with their own lobbyists, and are becoming entrenched as their own special interest.

It’s not a stupid investment so far.  So far is has crushed the S&P 500, so you’re wrong about the bottom line up until now.  Only time will tell long term."
2021-06-15 18:43:27,wallstreetbets,The government is paying people to stay home and not work when they have no reason to be out of work. Then they turn around and won’t qualify people who actually need the help. This pandemic has been eye opening. I’m ready to start a new country.
2021-06-15 13:29:43,wallstreetbets,Not really. Just learning and understanding the basics. Maybe watching or paper trading some to see how volatile they can be. Don’t options trade with money you aren’t willing to lose. Start slow. Don’t follow other people. Have a plan and stick to it. Spread your risk out
2021-06-15 13:15:25,wallstreetbets,Acceptance into this group has been a fuck you enough
2021-06-15 16:25:40,wallstreetbets,I invest and buy options that I honestly believe in. Usually a targeted catalyst (not earnings) 2-6 months out. Spread my risk. And have a true reason to buy. If I lose or it doesn’t hit I try and learn what I did wrong and why the play didn’t work out the way I thought and move on from it and not make the same mistake.
2021-06-15 13:28:11,wallstreetbets,He said the amount I bought of dkng was “crazy”. And I said that number is relative ((considered in relation or in proportion to something else.))to the overall amount I invest. Your statement was a specific opinion. It’s ok if you don’t know English that well though.
2021-06-15 12:05:18,wallstreetbets,"I’d say I would give their research the benefit of the doubt based on their track record with Nikola and Lordstown.  I would not short dkng based on this info though.  It’s just not too damning in my opinion; however, if they believe that it is then they have every right to short it and release their findings."

2021-06-15 15:51:39,wallstreetbets,"Not sure if you've ever done a money transfer with any of the legal gambling sites, but they come in with the same shady shit.  

Make your own gambles here, but I absolutely 100% do not feel safe giving my money to any industry that can get shut down in a minute by special interest wars based on morality.  It doesn't even have to be illegal for anyone processing credit card transactions to shut down gambling transactions, even if they're allowed to operate, same as guns (legal), weed (legal), and porn (super legal!).  There's still plenty of examples where those perfectly legal categories are blocked by payment processors, banks and credit cards.  It really doesn't take much for vice to get the bad end of the stick.  There's better investments out there."

2021-06-15 13:29:20,wallstreetbets,No. My opinion is that DKNG is too expensive right now.
2021-06-15 12:56:20,wallstreetbets,"I'm in the exact same boat as you. The research is probably good, but I'm not sure about the conclusion. If anything is going to bring DKNG down, it's their unsustainable spending, not shady gambling operations in developing countries by a subsidiary."
2021-06-15 12:12:58,wallstreetbets,"That’s fair. They nailed NKLA and rightfully so. That CEO was a slapdick and ultimately led to Hindenburg snooping which is ok IMO. To be fair, we’re all bias especially when money is involved but this DKNG thing is huge. We shall see."

2021-06-15 15:57:50,wallstreetbets,"Well, I would always agree don’t invest in what you aren’t comfortable with, but the federal government and supreme court have been crystal clear on the legality and leaving it to the states, and even in this partisan time we see this as one area receiving bi-partisan support, which is interesting.  In my state, the VERY powerful tribes that have all the state and local politicians in their back pocket and have operated all the in-person casinos for many many decades are partnering with DraftKings, so if they are successful like that in even half the states I think the upside justifies any risks.  Not YOLOing the 401k, but still a bullish certain % of the mix."

2021-06-15 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$ABNB DD - The timing is ready for it to explode! Hey Apes, Long time lurker of the sub, recently just made a reddit account as I think I have some solid DD! Not financial advice, just giving my opinion. Here's some reasons why I think Airbnb ($ABNB) is ready to 🚀🚀🚀 over the next few months:

* As first-world countries (where $ABNB generates most profits) have started effectively rolling out their vaccinations programs, ""staycations"" to different cities/regions within countries will go up as a lot of countries have international travel restrictions. 
* In addition to this, many large companies have are beginning to accept work from home policies, with employees getting tired of staying at home, and having no real reason to be in a specific location, staying in Airbnbs will become increasingly popular. 
* The stock started trading on IPO at around $140, and exploded to highs of $220, this is a popular stock that people can get behind. It is currently trading at $150, its a good deal right now - people seem to have forgotten about it.
* Over the closure of Airbnb in many regions, I imagine the company is silently waiting for the world to open up more and have a ton of marketing campaigns ready, furthermore they have 100+ new features ([https://news.airbnb.com/2021-release/](https://news.airbnb.com/2021-release/)) ready to go. They still even managed to attain $3.4bn in revenue during the pandemic, when the world opens up, I see exponential growth on this.
* I truly believe in the future, people will get bored of staying in hotels, as Airbnbs offer a more affordable and authentic experience. I not only believe the stock will explode in the next few months, but continue to grow in the next 5 years, it's a good company to hold.

I have only recently started investing over the last 2 years (I only have around $1500), but this is my first DD i'd like to share with you guys, tell me what you think! 

**TL;DR -** $ABNB is at a good price, they have been laying dormant over the pandemic and I expect them to explode with the world slowly opening up more for travel and their new features they have been working on; they continue to innovate in the space and I think they are a good long term hold. 

This is my position [position](https://ibb.co/4YG1jz3)"
2021-06-15 10:21:28,wallstreetbets,Removed until you put your positions in a TLDR.
2021-06-15 11:43:36,wallstreetbets,25 shares and counting. I’ll sell in 20 years.
2021-06-15 10:20:46,wallstreetbets,"IMO, I believe it’s the other way around. This thing exploded because of the pandemic. As things open up hotels become more available.  ABNB currently priced higher than most hotel chains.  And condos and hi-rises still have by-laws preventing abnb. You also have a fast growing competitor HomeAway that’s eating away at the market share."

2021-06-15 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"EXCUSE ME SIR, THIS IS A CASINO. YOU DO NOT F WITH MY CASINO $DKNG Hindenburg Research, an investment research firm with a focus in activist short-selling which also publishes reports on alleged fraud by other companies, has chosen DraftKings (DKNG) as its next target. Shares are down around 7% in pre-market after Hindenburg announced that it would be taking a short position on the American sports betting operator. DraftKings was not immediately available for comment.

In its report titled “DraftKings: A $21 Billion SPAC Betting It Can Hide Its Black Market Operations,” published this morning, Hindenburg describes the company as having experienced “one of the more successful deals in a recent wave of SPAC transactions marred by scandal and bad actors.”

DraftKings, which went public in early 2020 after a merger between DraftKings, its SPAC, and SBTech, a gaming technology company based in Bulgaria, has since experienced gains in its share price of around 400%.

“Unbeknownst to investors, DraftKings’ merger with SBTech also brings exposure to extensive dealings in black-market gaming, money laundering and organized crime,” the report read. “Based on conversations with multiple former employees, a review of SEC & international filings, and inspection of back-end infrastructure at illicit international gaming websites, we show that SBTech has a long and ongoing record of operating in black markets.”

According to the report, Hindenburg estimates that approximately 50% of SBTech’s revenue is generated from markets in which gambling is outlawed, citing DraftKings’ SEC filings, correspondence with former employees, and other supporting documents.

The report then goes on to cover the operations of BTi/CoreTech, which Hindenburg describes as a “distributor entity” with around 50 employees which SBTech uses to “distance itself from its black-market dealings.”

“Illicit customer relationships were shuffled into a newly formed ‘distributor’ entity called BTi/CoreTech, with ~50 SBTech employees shifted across town to the new entity,” the report read.

**Past targets of Hindenburg include Nikola (NKLA), Chinese firm Ebang (EBON), Clover Health (CLOV), and Loop Industries (LOOP).**

2021-06-15 14:12:14,wallstreetbets,"They apparently based this off of one interview From an ex employee. I trust Credit Suisse over a shitty firm. Credit Suisse's rebuttal direct from r/stocks -

 Here is Credit Suisse's take on it:

>Credit Suisse analyst Benjamin Chaiken, however, thinks the stock's move might be overdone, given that he sees minimal value in DraftKing's being applied to SBTech.

>""Our view is that SBTech was purchased by DraftKings for its tech platform rather than its existing revenue stream,"" he said. ""Said another way, if SBTech revenues were to go away entirely, we think there would be minimal impact on the DraftKings stock.""  

>""While not ideal, in a worst case scenario, an SBTech issue would not necessarily interfere with betting operations today,"" he added. ""We would use today’s weakness as an opportunity ahead of potential Canada legalization as well as New York, both of which are catalysts for DraftKings."""
2021-06-15 16:24:51,wallstreetbets,"Be careful. Just because Hindenburg has a vested interest doesn't necessarily mean they are wrong.

I don't have enough info yet either way, but uh ... that list of past targets is 50/50. Heck, people swore for awhile that NKLA would come back (before more details came out and people started hating them)."

2021-06-15 10:17:34,wallstreetbets,DKNG has rising revenue but it is still loosing money every quarter and has close to 1.5B of debt. The current valuation of 38 Billion is very high IMO untill we see a consistent 1 or 2 Billion of realized income every year and that could be years away.

And in exchange for taking on this massive amount of risk, Credit Suisse reaped... *\[checks notes\]*... a few tens of millions of dollars in fees over several years? That Credit Suisse?

Hindenburg is hardly immune to errors or criticism. But I think Draft Kings is going to want a few other defenders besides just Credit Suisse."

2021-06-15 16:53:26,wallstreetbets,"DKNG is the king of online gambling. They aren’t making profit because they are using the money for advertising to dominate the market share. They constantly increase revenue. The advertising will taper off, the profits will roll in and I think it was fairly valued around 70 a share but I expect it to be no less than 80 a share by end of year. I don’t mind they short it. I mind that they push fake news to help out their short position and CNBC and all the financial news places eat it up and help drive down the price. If anyone deserves to have their shorts shoved down their throats it’s these guys."
2021-06-15 13:56:00,wallstreetbets,"Look. Look. You might be right. But you can gamble on DKNG from your iPhone while behind the Wendy’s dumpster looking for a $TWNK while also having some tendies. Why not do all of it ?

Positions in WEN, DKNG, TWNK. The trifecta"
2021-06-15 11:31:06,wallstreetbets,"I think a huge part is that they're turning that profit into marketing expenses. So I don't see them losing money in a quarter as bad really. They're betting on themselves and I like that. They look like they will grab the majority of the market share, whether that's due to aggressive advertising or not is up for debate. With more states legalizing, I can see them turning massive profits in the near future.

Tldr, dkng is a grower, not a shower."
2021-06-15 11:07:59,wallstreetbets,That is like saying amazon was a bad buy because it never made a profit.  Their numbers are actually scary good.

2021-06-15 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"UWMC DD. The play even you can’t fuck up. Ok, first off. The volume on UWMC today was just fucking pathetic. I mean just fucking embarrassing. Let me tell you why we are missing a simple, straight forward, trip to tendie town.

UWMC has had a nice run over the last month, up about 25% over that time and up 10% over the last week. This has run the share price to over $10 per share making the potential for us to get a little sweet gamma action with the 6/18 contracts looming.

Open interest on ITM calls is getting interesting. Already over 100k contracts are in the money, mostly between 9c and 10c. You could see the price action today as they try to beat the price down to 10.00 one last time (and the piss poor volume is making it easy for them) before hedging some of these positions. If we were to get over 11.00 by EOW, that's another 60k open interest on the 11c alone!! and this will force more buying to cover these contracts. You know what happens from here. This is why we are here.

The problem is the lack of volume. Again, 10 million volume today, for fuck sake people. With a float of 90m shares (I don't want to start a pissing match, but much smaller than CLOV and CLNE), this thing is not hard to move. With 25m volume on 6/9 we had an 8% move. With volume of 13m on 6/11 another 6% jump. After today the share price is sitting just above 10. I am a retard, and not a mathematician, but another 10% by EOW and then we party. Hookers, blow, whatever you want.

Ill cover this just cuz I know you retards get hard over the potential. >15% short float. Not why I am here, but you never know once this things gets moving.

Nextly, the calls because this is a casino after all. 7/16 calls are very reasonable, fuck, I'd call them a god damn bargain for the potential we are looking at here. This thing has yet to lift off and the IV is still reasonable enough to jump on this gamma rocket.

Last point I will make. UWMC is actually a solid company. I am not covering the fundamentals a ton, but holding a $10 UWMC bag is a lot more attractive than others I have seen gain steam recently. 4% dividend, upcoming 300m in share buy back, Revenue and EPS doubled from Q1 2020 to Q1 2021. Not even you can fuck this up. You make money now, you make money later, your kids make money in 20 years from your wise decision this week. Get a forward from your wife's bf on this weeks allowance and get you some of this action.

Positions: 150 shares at 8.20 average, (24) 7/16 calls at various strike.

TLDR: UWMC on the launch pad, needs a little more fuel."
2021-06-15 10:22:32,wallstreetbets,I dont even have to read this to know my smooth brain will still fuck it up
2021-06-15 11:28:33,wallstreetbets,"The play even I can’t fuck up?

This is so ready to pop and has potential for a huge gamma but just needs momentum. Everyone is sleeping on this. Calls and shares are stupid cheap and people can make multiple baggers on this but are too invested in memes that have already popped with huge IV.

2021-06-15 13:04:39,wallstreetbets,I loaded up more shares today during the dip. Not surprised it’s dropping today since the whole market is in the shitter. I also think that shorts will do anything they can do keep it under 10 for the 6/18 calls expiring this Friday. I’m deep in UWMC shares and calls and I agree this is actually a very safe buy with some short term potential as well. Solid play every WSB retard should be diversified into- “safe” meme stocks
2021-06-15 13:35:08,wallstreetbets,"People with 100% options, just sell half of your UWMC options and buy shares with that proceeds while you can."

2021-06-15 16:07:07,wallstreetbets,"I must be the Bob Ross painting of a smooth brain because I don't understand shit about calls and puts and this is after reading the stuff Fidelity has available and multiple YouTube videos that made it seem like I could do it.    



Instead I picked up 50 shares of this because last week I read someone's DD that said this one actually makes money. I did my own investigatory research into the company and I like it but I feel like someone asked me to solve for X and I without hesitation sharpened my crayon and ate the shavings.     

I still have no idea what I'm doing but I hope this red turns green."

2021-06-15 12:51:29,wallstreetbets,"The next few quarters could be difficult for the industry, but United Wholesale's focus on purchase and its lower relative costs to originate make it a likely survivor. The stock is trading at 15 times this year's expected earnings per share, which is pricey for a mortgage originator. The Street is looking for earnings to grow 37% from 2021 to 2022, while earnings for crosstown rival Rocket are expected to fall 27% over the same period. Analysts clearly see United Wholesale's business model as built to survive the coming price war."

2021-06-15 15:22:07,wallstreetbets,"Here's another thing you can do.  The stock is not expensive.  You could buy hundreds of shares for thousands of dollars.  I have 1000 shares.  Then you could sell covered OTM calls for every 100 shares you have.  Have a high strike price, say, $16 for EOW (current price is under $10.)  Collect the premium.  If the stock goes up but doesn't go past $16 by EOW, you keep the premium and the stock.  If it goes down, you keep the premium and the stock.  If it goes past $16 you get assigned, sell the stock for a big profit and buy more if you still think it's worth it.  This strategy works well if you have a LOT of the stock.  This company has such solid financials that you could do this and make more money along the way.  Thoughts?"

2021-06-15 19:54:09,wallstreetbets,6/18 calls are screwed due to quad witching. It will remain under $10 this week. This stock doesn’t move too much and it was a SPAC so don’t get too excited. I own more shares than I care to have at this point but only because I’m stuck with covered calls.
2021-06-15 19:57:37,wallstreetbets,Is 7/16 a retard call? Or should I have waited for September?

I sold this morning at a loss. The momentum on here died down and again one of the posts pumping it, one of the main posts, was fraudulent. Now you guys may end up making a whole bunch of money off of this and I'm all for that. But I lost confidence in this one."

2021-06-15 17:20:19,wallstreetbets,"From a fundamental perspective, why buy now? Interest rates are rising, loan activity is going to drop significantly. The entire mortgage industry is going to get more competitive. UWMC is clearly a good mortgage company, but do you really expect its price to rise given industrial factors? 

I see this as buying a sinking ship on the basis that it's sinking slightly less slower than the rest of the fleet. Just get into an industry that isn't going to sink for now, then come back later after the damage to this industry is done. 

Just hinting at short/gamma squeezes doesn't make it a good play."

2021-06-15 16:01:53,wallstreetbets,"You should really look at the company overall.  Yes, there is potential for a short squeeze, however, this is not a good company to invest in.  So if the squeeze doesn't happen chances are you will loose money overall since this stock in general will decrease since the company is not performing.  If you want to take the chances on short squeezes then minimize your risk.  There are other stocks out there that are in a good overall financial position and are being shorted and there are potentials to be short squeezes but if a squeeze doesn't happen then you are still in a good spot since the company will increase performance overall and if the stock is held for 1+ years then you will inevitably still see the stock price rise, and you will be in the green.

&#x200B;

Not financial advise but just a warning on these meme squeezes.  Trust me I am still in on the Meme squeezes and have invested in quite a few with great returns, but I do my DD before hand and make sure the company is in a good financial position overall encase the squeeze fails and I go into the red, I know that in time, I will be back in the green.  So shoot for High reward but look for lower risk.  This is one that I will be staying away from."

2021-06-15 14:40:12,wallstreetbets,"I am bracing for downvotes once again with my unpopular opinion.

Uwmc needs much more than just volume. Besides a wsb magic (which can revive bankrupt companies), there is not much going for uwmc. Moreover, how is 1% SI going to impact anything when there is literally 90M float (Current 5/28 numbers from Schwab)?

Those who bought under 8, when it was oversold had a good entry point. And saw the gains but right now it will be a slow painful bagholding experience. Specially for those who buy calls instead of buyung shares.

Fwiw, RKT on the other hand is setting up for a longer term bullish trend once price crosses 200 day moving average and has much more institutional ownership. 

Would love to hear counter arguments before downvotes begin."

* Nearly 1m shorts were borrowed in the morning leaving shorts available to 850,000

2021-06-15 17:31:52,wallstreetbets,"I think a lot of people underestimate UWMC's growth potential in the sector.  They're the only lender I've worked through that didn't give me the ""Fuck you, you need me"" vibe.  It's been an open secret for years how poorly coordinated many mortgage companies are, but that's not the case here.   


To say they are rapidly expanding would be a bit... misleading.  They are exploding in growth and on a hiring frenzy in SE Michigan.  Employees love the opportunities to advance and Mat's Oprah like giveaways at the holiday party.  They have happy customers AND employees and are bulldozing their way to the number one lender position.


In the short term I see it rising because of increasing sentiment, YOY growth, and a high short interest.  In the long term I see them increasing because I believe they are going to overtake Rocket Mortgage due to their loan process and efficiency.  


Will it Gamma squeeze?  Who knows, definitely not me.  Is it a good company to invest in given their position in the market and medium term prospects?  I think so.

2021-06-15 18:17:09,wallstreetbets,"UWMC can be profitable and gain market share even at 70 points seeing as their cost to originate is 53. More volume = more profits. They're also positioned to do extremely well in a rising rate environment, because they are primarily a purchase origination firm.  Obviously this isn't confirmed by earnings reports yet, but that's the thesis I have for a long hold here."

2021-06-15 16:31:11,wallstreetbets,">Not financial advise but just a warning on these meme squeezes.  Trust me I am still in on the Meme squeezes and have invested in quite a few with great returns, but I do my DD before hand and make sure the company is in a good financial position overall encase the squeeze fails and I go into the red, I know that in time, I will be back in the green.  So shoot for High reward but look for lower risk.  This is one that I will be staying away from.

What are you talking about?  This is an incredibly profitable company, has always been so, and likely will be in future, and it pays an incredible dividend.  This not a ""meme squeeze"", and even if it was it is hundreds of time better than the totally busto loss-making cesspits like AMC that are being pumped and dumped in other threads here.

Full disclosure - holding 9750 shares of UWMC."

If it goes above the X + the premium of the call (breakeven) at anytime before then, the buyer can sell the option to someone else for a profit. Buying naked calls can make you a lot of money - or more likely leave you with absolutely nothing."

We're in a consolidation range right now and there are FAR more sellers than buyers. While it can go either way, the trend is down and I don't fight trends."
2021-06-15 12:18:14,wallstreetbets,That would be them!
2021-06-15 17:07:58,wallstreetbets,Not sure why you would buy options with the sole intent of exercising to begin with though and even more not sure why you would exercise at strike instead of hoping they go way over; and even if they did you still make more on the option most likely then buying and selling the shares
2021-06-15 17:18:30,wallstreetbets,"It can be; the higher out on strikes you go, the riskier it is at the chance to score more money. For example the person who bought a 9$ strike call is already in the money since the underlying share is over 9$ already; however it comes at the cost of a higher premium paid especially since the expiry is 2 months out. So as long as it is above 9$ by atleast the premium he paid for the option, he will make a bit of money. It won't be much, but it's a much lower risk than buying OTM calls. Options are a good gamble if you have money you don't care to lose and are really certain a stock will hit a certain price by a certain date."

The main shills have done good, a lot of the other stuff has proven to be collective turds; black holes for the working class hopefuls’ hard earned dollars. The stock market in general has existed for longer than 6 months so track record means nothing when you have years upon years of losses. 

Very few make it big with any of these plays. The vast majority will lose money.

2021-06-15 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$NIO is worth looking in to! (DD) TLDR:  Nio has great potential, and great tech. however the only things to look out for are financial performance and possible share dilution! 

However I recommend you read this analysis!

I am sure you all have heard of a Chinese Electric Vehicle manufacturer that goes by the name [$NIO – NIO Inc.,](https://utradea.com/stocks/NIO) and I am sure that you have heard them been called the “Tesla of China” but this title is very deceiving and gives the impression that Nio perhaps copied [$TSLA - Tesla](https://utradea.com/stocks/TSLA). However, this is false because Nio has a completely different business model and very different technology (especially in their swappable batteries) than Tesla does. Nio is up nearly 1000% on the year, so I decided to do an analysis to find out what all the hype was about and if this hype can be justified.

**Company Overview:**

Nio is a leading manufacturer of premium, smart, electric vehicles. Nio designs, develops, manufactures, and sells their vehicles to their main customer base in China. Furthermore, Nio is constantly looking to improve upon their autonomous driving, digital technology, battery technology and their powertrains, in order to differentiate themselves from their competition.

Nio has industry-leading battery swapping technology, which drives their battery as a service (BaaS) business. Additionally, Nio also has proprietary autonomous driving technology, which enables their Autonomous Driving as a Service (ADaaS) business.

Nio currently sells their vehicles in China, however they are planning on expanding their business into international markets, to capitalize on the growing demand for EV’s. Nio has 4 vehicle models, their ES8, ES6, EC6, and their ET7.

**Investment Information:**

*Vehicle Offerings:*

· **ES8** is a 6-7 seat premium electric SUV that features 2 induction motors (240 kW). The ES8 accelerated from 0-100 kph in 4.4 seconds and is ranked 5 stars by the C-NCAP (Chinese New Car Assessment Program) for their safety standards. Lastly, the ES8 can go roughly 355 km on a single charge. IN 2020, Nio sold 10,861 of their ES8 models.

· **ES6** is a 5-seat high-performance SUV that features one magnet motor (160 kW) and one induction motor (240 kW). The ES6 can accelerate from 0-100 kph in 4.7 seconds and can reach up to 430km on a single charge. In 2020, Nio sold 27,945 of their ES6 models.

· **EC6** is a Coupe SUV that features one (160 kW) magnet motor, and a (240 kW) Induction motor. The EC6 is capable of accelerating from 0-100 kph in 4.5 seconds, and it can go 440 km (70 kWh battery) to 615 km (100 kWh battery) on a single charge. The EC6 also features a 2.1 square meter panoramic glass roof. In 2020, Nio sold a total of 4,922 of their EC6 models, basically just in Q4 alone (16 were sold in Q3 and none in Q1/Q2).

· **ET7** is a Sedan that offers 1 front magnet motor (180 kW), and one back Induction motor (300 kW). The ET7 is very aerodynamic and can accelerate from 0-100 kph in a mere 3.9 seconds. The ET7 has 5-star safety ratings from both Chinese and European Assessment Programs. The ET7 also features their computing system (Adam) and super sensing system (Aquila). This vehicle is said to be able to reach distances of 1000 km on a single charge (with their 150-kWh battery).

*Battery Swapping (BaaS):*

Nio’s battery swapping technology is supported by over 1,200 patents and this technology is supported on all of Nio’s vehicles. This technology provides Nio customers with the convenience of quickly swapping their battery for another one to continue their journey quicker through a seamless recharge.

Nio is releasing their Power Swap Station 2.0 in 2021, which will decrease their swap time to roughly 3 minutes and have the capacity for 13 rotational battery packs. In 2020, Nio had 172 Swapping Stations in 74 cities that swapped 1.4 million batteries.

Nio’s Battery as a Service business generates revenue through “battery subscriptions”, in which users have flexible subscription options that they can choose to fit their battery swapping needs. Currently, Nio has several subscriptions for both their 70 kWh, and their 100 kWh batteries.

If a customer were to select the 70-kWh subscription, they would enjoy approximately $11,000 (USD) off of the purchase price of their vehicle and pay a monthly subscription of approximately $150 (USD).

If a customer selects the 100-kWh subscription plan, they will enjoy approximately $20,000 (USD) off of the purchase price of their vehicle and pay a monthly subscription of $231 (USD).

*Autonomous Driving (ADaaS):*

Nio has worked on their autonomous technology since day one and now delivers their products that come with “Nio Pilot”, their Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS). Furthermore, Nio is about to roll out their Nio Autonomous driving (NAD).

Consisting of 23 sensors, a front-facing tri-focal camera, 4 exterior cameras, 5 radars, 12 ultrasonic sensors and an interior driver-monitoring camera, **Nio Pilot** is Chinas only ADAS that is on the market. [Nio Pilot](https://www.nio.com/news/new-nio-pilot-option-packs-and-navigation-pilot-2020) has fleet learning and AI analysis capabilities that will be able to update their cars over the clous and improve their algorithms using their extensive backlog of driving data.

In January 2021, Nio announced [their Autonomous Driving capabilities (NAD)](https://www.nio.com/nad). The NAD system was developed in-house and features perception algorithms, localization, control strategy software, and platform software. The NAD technology uses their super computing platform “Adam”, and their super sensing system “Aquila”.

Nio is planning to roll out their NAD to their customers, through a subscription model similar to their battery sapping service. This subscription is estimated to cost users $106 (USD) per month.

*Electric Powertrain:*

Nio has developed, designed, and manufactured their own proprietary electric powertrains in house since their inception. Nio makes powertrains that are specific to their vehicles, and through their Firmware over-the-air (FOTA) Nio is able to continually improve, update, and adjust their cars to fit the behaviour of their driver.

Nio has greatly improved their motors moving from their 240-kW 2nd generation induction motor to their 300-kW 3rd generation induction motor. Additionally, Nio has improved their magnet motors from 160 kW (2nd gen.) to 180 kW (3rd gen.)

It is this constant drive to keep improving their technology that will help separate Nio from their competitors and help Nio to become one of the best EV manufacturers.

*Battery:*

Nio is very committed to R&D and innovating their battery technology. Currently, Nio offers two battery options: their 70-kWh battery, and their 100-kWh battery.

Their 70-kWh battery is designed, developed and manufactured in-house, and combines Nickel-Cobalt-Manganese) NCM prismatic cells, liquid cooling systems and intelligent battery management systems.

Their proprietary and patented 100-kWh battery features thermal propagation prevention, climate thermal management, and bi-directional cloud Building Management Systems (BMS).

Nio has also [announced their 150-kWh battery](https://insideevs.com/news/465188/nio-150-kwh-solid-state-batteries-2022/) which is expected to release in Q4 2022, or Q1 2023, which is another large innovation to their existing technology and proves their determination to be the most innovative.

*Intellectual Property:*

Nio has developed a number of proprietary technologies throughout their business journey. Nio relies on their ability to protect their technologies and property through the use of patents, patent applications, NDA’s, copyrights, trademarks, and intellectual property licenses.

Nio currently has 2,654 patents that have been approved, 1,397 patents that are in the application process, 3,373 registered trademarks, 804 trademark applications, 133 copyrights, and 686 registered domain names.

*Financial information:*

· **Financial Performance (Good):** Vehicle sales are up by 106.08% YoY, and their cost of sales is only up by 63.72%, which means that their margins are improving. This year was Nio’s first year having a gross profit, which equalled $287M (USD). Their SG&A expenses decreased by 27.88% YoY, which is good and helps their margins. Lastly, Nio decreased their operating loss by 58.42% which shows that they are making their way towards profitability, which would be a huge milestone.

· **Financial Performance (Bad):** R&D expense decreased by 43.82% YoY. While this usually is a good sign, R&D is important to Nio’s business model and future successes, so I would like this figure to be higher. Although Nio decreased their operating losses, they still reported a $706M operating loss (USD) and a $813M net loss, this is not favourable for investors and might scare away potential investors.

· **Stock Incentive Plan:** Nio’s stock incentive plan was designed to attract and retain the best possible personnel to promote the success of Nio’s business. Under their 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 stock plans, there are currently 79.32M shares outstanding, that have yet to have been granted. If all of these outstanding shares were to be granted, it would cause dilutionary effects of roughly 6.45%.

· **Share Options:** As of December 31st, 2020, there are 32.5M common shares available in options that are yet to be exercised (and converted into common shares). If these options were to be exercised, it would cause a dilutionary effect of 2.6%.

· **Restricted Shares Outstanding:** Currently, there are 1,735,744 shares outstanding that are classified as “restricted”, these shares will be vested gradually over a period of time, these shares have a weighted-average period of 3.6 years. If these shares were put on the market today it would cause dilutionary effects of 0.14% over 3.6 years, which is essentially negligible.

*Management Team:*

One of the most important aspects of high-growth stocks is the management team that is heading the company. We have seen awful management teams destroy promising stocks over and over again, so it important to know the management team, their experience, and their track record(s). With that being said, lets dive into Nio’s management team.

· **Bin Li (CEO & Chairman):** Mr. Li founded and served as the director for Beijing Bitauto E-commerce Co. from 2000-2006. After that, Mr. Li served as the chairman of the board of Bitauto Holdings. (Formerly listed on the NYSE. Mr. Li has also been named as one of the top 10 most influential/distinguishable people in China’s automotive industry by CADA in 2008. As we can see Mr. Li has a history in the automotive space and is a distinguished person in the space as well, which can help vouch for his credibility.

· **Lihong Qin (President & Director):** Prior to Nio, Mr. Qin was the Chief Marketing Officer and Executive Director at Longfor Properties Co. from 2008-2014. Mr. Qin also served as a Senior Consultant and Deputy GM of Anhui Chery Automobile Sales and Service Company form 2005-2008. Mr. Qin has both a background in the Auto Industry (though Anhui Chery) and in the field of management (through Longfor Properties).

· **Feng Shen (Executive VP):** Mr. Shen worked in several executive management roles prior to working at Nio. Mr. Shen was the President and Chief Technology Officer at Polestar China, President and VP at Volvo Cars China and Volvo Asia-Pacific, Chairman at China-Sweden Traffic Safety Research Center from 2010-2017. Prior to this he worked at Ford Motor Company as a Powertrain manager. Mr. Shen has extensive experience in both the management space (Polestar and China-Sweden Traffic), and the automotive industry (Ford, and Volvo).

· **Xin Zhou (Executive VP):** Mr. Zhou served as the Executive Director at Qoros Automotive C. from 2009-2015, and prior to this was the Engagement Manager at McKinsey Co. from 2007-2009. Mr. Zhou has experience in both the Automotive Industry, as well as in management positions, and his experience will be an asset for Nio in the future.

· **Wei Feng (CFO):** Mr. Feng was previously the Managing Director and Head of the auto/auto parts research team at China International Capital Corp. from 2013-2019. Prior to this he was an industry analyst at Everbright Securities from 2010-2013. Mr.Feng has great experience in the financial industry, and has focused on the auto industry and researching the industry.

· **Ganesh Iyer (Chief Information Officer):** Mr.Iyer has over 32 years of experience In the autonomous technology, hi-tech, manufacturing, and telecom industries. Mr. Iyer was previously the VP of IT at Tesla from 2012-2016 and was the Senior IT roles at VMWare from 2010-2012. Mr. Iyer has plenty of experience that will help him to drive the future progression/growth at Nio.

**Investment Valuation:**

The only way in which I could value Nio is through a set of comparable analyses. These analyses will compare some of Nio’s financial ratio’s/multiples to that of their competitors.

*Comparable Analysis #1:*

In this comparable I compared Nio’s financial ratios to that of [$TSLA – Tesla](https://utradea.com/stocks/TSLA), [$XPEV – Xpeng](https://utradea.com/stocks/XPEV), and [$LI – Li Auto](https://utradea.com/stocks/LI).

*EV/Assets:*

When comparing Nio’s EV/Assets multiple to that of their competitors (as listed above), I found that Nio has a fair value of $257.66, which wouldimply a share price increase of 453.39%. This is very optimistic, so I decided to undergo more comparables to find out if this result was consistent.

*EV/Revenue:*

By Comparing Nio’s EV/Revenue multiple to that of their competitors (excluding Xpeng because their ratio was not positive), I found that Nio is $196.70, which implies an increase in value of 322.47%. This is quite similar and consistent with the results achieved in the EV/Assets comparable, so I decided to do one last comparable to gain more insight.

*P/B:*

By comparing Nio’s P/B ratio to that of their competitors, I arrived at a fair value of $45.19 per share, which would imply a downside risk of 2.94%. This is inconstant with the other 2 results, so I decided to average the results achieved by each comparable to reach an unbiased valuation.

*Average Comparable #1:*

By taking the average of all 3 comparable that I underwent in this analysis I arrived at a final all-encompassing price target of $166.51, which would imply a price increase of 257.62%.

*Comparable #2:*

I decided to undergo a second comparable to factor out the influence of Tesla on the results of my first comparable. I did this for a variety of reasons, which include Tesla being valued so much higher than the other EV comparable companies, Tesla being the only company located outside of China (this is because Chinese companies tend to be undervalued, so taking the comparable for these solely Chinese companies makes more sense), and these other companies pose more of a threat to Nio given their ***current*** geographical reach.

*EV/Assets:*

By comparing Nio’s EV/Assets multiple to XPeng and Li Auto, I found that Nio’s fair value is approximately $51.64, which would imply a share price increase of 10.91%. this is very reasonable, however I decided to undergo the other comparable to either validate or invalidate this result.

*EV/Revenue:*

By comparing Nio’s EV/Revenue multiple to Li Auto (because XPeng does not have a positive EV/Revenue multiple), I arrived at a fair value of Nio of $52.00, which would imply an upside of 11.68%. Once again, this is very reasonable and constant with the result from the EV/Assets comparable.

*P/B:*

By comparing Nio’s P/B multiple to their Chinese competitors, I arrived at a fair value of $37.46, which implies a downside risk of 19.54%. This is not consistent with the results achieved in the previous 2 analyses, and as a result of this I decided to average my results to achieve an unbiased fair value.

*Average Comparable #2:*

By taking the average of the fair values that I achieved in the 2nd comparable analysis (w/o Tesla), I achieved one all-encompassing fair value of $47.03, which implies an upside of 1.07%, meaning that Nio is approximately at fair value in comparison to their Chinese competitors.

*My Thoughts:*

I think the fact that Nio is undervalued when comparing them to their Chinese competitors is very good for the stock. I believe that Nio should be overvalued compared to them because Nio presents a larger upside. The fact that Nio is undervalued is very bullish, and when incorporating Tesla is extremely bullish. I think the comparable with Tesla will be more applicable when Nio starts to expand their operations internationally, as they will likely start to be valued as less of a “Chinese stock” and more of a legitimate EV company.

I think that investors need to keep up to date with Nio’s financial reports to make sure that they are on the right track, since here is no way to do a proper DCF right now. But other than this, Nio is looking very bullish.

**Risks:**

· **Dilution:** Nio has multiple different streams of possible dilution that will negatively affect their shares price, these streams consist of Nio’s Share Incentive Plan, Stock Options, and Restricted Stock Units. All of these streasm would combine to make a total dilutionary effect of roughly 9.19%, which is not bad. Typically, high growth stocks have large amounts of dilution, and some of Nio’s dilution is spread over 3 years, so I do not see this being a huge risk, although it is worth keeping in mind.

· **Financial Performance**: Nio reported an operating loss and net loss of $706M and $813M respectively, this level of loss is not great to see as investors however they are making moves toward profitability which is good to see. Furthermore, Nio almost cut their R&D spending by ½, which is not favourable in my eyes because I would rather Nio spend the extra money to further develop their technologies and be the most technologically advanced EV maker in China/the World.

**Catalysts:**

· **Financial Performance:** Nio exhibited great growth YOY, while keeping the cost of sales growth significantly lower than their revenue growth. Furthermore, Nio reported a gross profit for the first time and decreased their operating losses significantly. If Nio can continue to improve their financial reports/position, and become profitable in the near future, then this will serve as a huge catalyst for Nio.

· **Social Sentiment:** According to [Utradea’s Social Sentiment Tracker](https://utradea.com/feed), Nio is currently the 20th, 16th, and 18th most trending stock om Reddit in the past 4, 24, and 48 hours respectively, with an overall positive sentiment. As we know Reddit can have beneficial impacts on stocks that they target and is important to keep in mind as a current/future investor.

· **Technology:** Nio has been consistently improving upon their technology, moving from their 1st to 2nd, and now to their 3rd generation of Electric Powertrains. Nio has consistently been improving their motors (both magnet and induction) to futher the technology of their EV’s and offer superior range. Furthermore, Nio is set to release their 150-kWh battery in late 2022, this battery is expected to have a range of 1000km, if this is true they will have the longest range of any EV by a long shot, which will help show Nio’s superior technology.

As you can imagine, this analysis too a lot of time for me to put together, so I would greatly appreciate it if you [follow me](https://utradea.com/member-portfolio/WallStreetWhale?utm_source=R&utm_medium=B&utm_campaign=NIO) to read my previous posts nd stay up-to-date on my new posts!

2021-06-15 10:21:17,wallstreetbets,"No problem, you deserve it! Your analysis was very coherent and easy to follow. 

One thing I’d like to point out that may be good to include is their emphasis on NIO growing into more than just an EV company, as they want to become a lifestyle brand in China. Their NIO houses, multiple product lines (fashion, etc), and community outreach have the potential to raise the ceiling that a pure-play EV company might not, in my opinion. Whether this will be successful and translate to a larger market cap in the future, I’m not sure, but it certainly raises the excitement for me seeing that they have such massive goals."

2021-06-15 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"GOEV (Canoo) Press Release GOEV is still attempting to climb to $10 and sustain that level ahead of their investor relations on the 17th and as a prelude to that moment they opted for a press release detailing “Canoo Debuts Air Purifying Climate Control with UV Technology”

[https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/canoo-debuts-air-purifying-climate-control-with-uv-technology](https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/canoo-debuts-air-purifying-climate-control-with-uv-technology)

>“The Wellness Package enhances interior air quality, attacks odors and kills viruses instantly, including Covid-19, and will be pre-loaded in the Premium and Adventure packages of its Lifestyle Vehicle.“

Feel free to read more but essentially they have a system which kills the smells of sweaty gross folks and the cold virus an Covid that disgusting kids have all over them from school.

In my opinion this is an incredible addition given the current and expected climates of sickness and pandemic driven technology. If nothing else it should serve as a standard by which other manufacturers can spin idea off of in order to serve their own customers and broader market.

Does this one addition mean 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 well, that’s a bit far fetched, but it at least means they’re stepping in the right direction. I’m looking forward to seeing what GOEV has to offer on the 17th,  and ideally seeing what they unveil over the summer. Hopefully there will be some substantive talk about their manufacturing and what they can meet in terms of initial vehicle rollout.

2021-06-15 14:59:28,wallstreetbets,tl;dr - don't get talked into bagholding AMC and GME at these levels.
2021-06-15 16:56:44,wallstreetbets,Fundamentals don’t matter with meme stocks
2021-06-15 10:45:28,wallstreetbets,Can anyone explain me why would you rather buy a call with a target of 30 or 60 instead of like a 20?  Don't you make more profit after it hits your strike?
2021-06-15 10:19:25,wallstreetbets,did you need to post this in every single $WISH thread in a 10 minute timeframe
2021-06-15 15:54:58,wallstreetbets,$14.64 average.. 👏👏
2021-06-15 10:14:42,wallstreetbets,You call that a crash?
2021-06-15 09:54:44,wallstreetbets,Or if it hits your strike price because that’s what options are I’m not here to exercise my options just be happy we all are getting behind a play ape to the fucking moon! 🚀🚀🪐
2021-06-15 10:26:39,wallstreetbets,I just bought 420
2021-06-15 10:35:56,wallstreetbets,Doesn’t WISH have a few class action lawsuits coming up against them? Shady ass company.
2021-06-15 14:07:14,wallstreetbets,"I did DD in $WISH a while back in r/stocks and yeah, it's garbage."
2021-06-15 14:37:52,wallstreetbets,Or you could let your lady buy some lululemon
2021-06-15 14:18:54,wallstreetbets,Bots!
2021-06-15 10:36:57,wallstreetbets,Did you just call me a hedge fund? There can be more than one play my dude but do you I guess 😂 WISH TO THE FUCKING MOON BABY

2021-06-15 14:04:20,wallstreetbets,"What would you suggest then? A dying retail chain that sells physical games? 

Perhaps I'll buy GME at $350 if they decide to revive MovieStop. I haven't watched a new movie in 5 years! Who sells them anymore? My local KMart already closed down."
2021-06-15 14:06:22,wallstreetbets,A lot of bots (and people who don't know any better). Wish is currently below yesterday's close and well below opening price. The pump has been dumped!
2021-06-15 10:47:20,wallstreetbets,So does half of this Reddit stop crying
2021-06-15 10:47:05,wallstreetbets,So do I pussy
2021-06-15 13:15:19,wallstreetbets,Apparently wish is a whale trying to pump and dump on the backs of apes.
2021-06-15 15:18:22,wallstreetbets,"There’s better DD out there, but here’s mine https://youtu.be/LVyvdcnqL48 I honestly don’t believe this is a pump and dump."
2021-06-15 14:37:11,wallstreetbets,"No DD. This is just a trick. Used by wallstreet to pump and dump chosen stocks by infiltrating this sub, and promoting stocks THEY want. And downvoting anything that’s counter to their narrative.

DO NOT BUY any of this trash.

GME and AMC are the only stocks that matter.

The meme-stonk rush is OVER.

Their plan worked. Look how much GME has fallen. No margin calls This Friday."
2021-06-15 11:35:53,wallstreetbets,"This is not financial advice, I have no idea what I'm talking about, this is just how I learned the concept and I thought it might help, someone smarter than me please help if I'm way off.

If you want to exercise the option, then yes, you want your strike price to be as close to the market price as possible while still being out of the money. If your goal is just to sell the option itself, you might get a better deal by entering with a lower cost basis by buying contracts farther OTM. For example, and this is just for visualization, not how things actually work, right now you can buy clne 6/18 $12 calls for .73 and $15 calls for .28. 7/16 calls at the same strikes are 1.88 and 1.45. just for argument, let's assume that the 7/16 calls are a reasonable approximation of the future value (it's not, don't do this, it's an example). The market price of the stock right now is 11ish. Even though the $12 call is closer, you'd make 2% more buying the $15 call if the value goes up according to our estimate [(1.45-.28)-(1.88-.73)=0.02]. Obviously you can't hold a 6/18 call until 7/16, just using that as an overly simplistic approximate slope for the curve of price movements over time."
2021-06-15 10:50:26,wallstreetbets,The more out of the money the cheaper the option is. The more gain you get as it gets closer.
2021-06-15 10:22:16,wallstreetbets,Someone needs to buy his calls!
2021-06-15 10:16:34,wallstreetbets,I call it ✨ dramatization ✨
2021-06-15 10:53:11,wallstreetbets,"Yep! Thanks for mentioning that! Super shady, don’t fall for their BS"
2021-06-15 15:00:49,wallstreetbets,Wait a website that’s notorious for being unable to deliver has bad DD??? I’m in shock.
2021-06-15 14:35:32,wallstreetbets,what are you talking about? wish deadass is a scam site for anything computer-related.

2021-06-15 10:40:22,wallstreetbets,Talking about me? How so?
2021-06-15 14:51:01,wallstreetbets,"I mean, yeah GME at $350 is probably dumb but when it was less than $100 you would be in hella money... Wish isn't the answer lol. This is the day trader crew trying to make a quick buck. It happened yesterday with Corsair and it is starting to get kind of pathetic."
2021-06-15 10:55:05,wallstreetbets,I guess you don't want the squeeze to happen
2021-06-15 13:31:15,wallstreetbets,"Did I get got? I just bought 20 shares @ 11.33 cus I lack wrinkles and was bored. No great loss if I've been pumped and dumped, but still sucks. Fuckin' way she goes."
2021-06-15 15:21:24,wallstreetbets,"WISH is less of a pump and dump than most the meme stocks I see on here. It should be valued around 18, but with the lawsuit, ceo/cfo selling some shares, and a few other factors it dramatically dipped because of fud. Look into it a bit before you respond to this. Im open to discussion I just see no reason for it not to hit at least 18."
2021-06-15 14:45:16,wallstreetbets,thank you fellow monke
2021-06-15 10:24:03,wallstreetbets,😂
2021-06-15 15:08:23,wallstreetbets,Bots... meaning... bots posting about pumping $WISH
2021-06-15 15:07:56,wallstreetbets,What is that? I'm not gonna click on a link...
2021-06-15 10:59:35,wallstreetbets,Sorry not you I meant the other guy calling you a hf
2021-06-15 10:58:22,wallstreetbets,"Nah this is wallstreetsqueeze or wallstreetvshedgefunds, it’s wallstreetBETS aka idiots making yolo plays hoping to get rich quick"
2021-06-15 11:00:23,wallstreetbets,Go check any other post you’ll see that WISH is a play AMC isn’t the only play we’re here to make money squeezes can happen in multiple stocks I was in on the original AMC pump so again stop crying WISH TO THE MOON
2021-06-15 13:57:16,wallstreetbets,"I've honestly have no idea, someone was talking about a thread yesterday where one of the apes was contacted by a shill and posted screenshots. I didn't see it, have also seen 0 dd on wish. Another ape was laughing about downvotes by bots. The only thing I do know is wish is a crapfestival websites that sells dollar store trash."
2021-06-15 11:00:59,wallstreetbets,Oh sorry I read it wrong lol let’s pray for wish to the moon
2021-06-15 11:44:41,wallstreetbets,You're missing the point...
2021-06-15 12:59:14,wallstreetbets,"He's saying because you're buying options not shares, nothing to do with AMC"
2021-06-15 14:02:43,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, that makes sense. What a shitshow this place has become, lol"
2021-06-15 13:07:45,wallstreetbets,Oh ok point understood this is wsb though I’m here to gamble let’s get it
2021-06-15 15:15:57,wallstreetbets,There is solid DD on wish. It reached nearly 30 this year and only fell off because of a bogus lawsuit and  people got scared because owners sold some shares. Look up the forecast for wish on any trustworthy site you use and see what it says. No reason it should be priced under 18.
2021-06-15 14:15:40,wallstreetbets,sheesh Im scared now cause I told my good friend to dip into $WISH yikes
2021-06-15 14:23:08,wallstreetbets,"I just use the sidebar and read the DD's and hold or improve my position on a few stonkers.

The front page is for the funny and eating crayons. 

I always check post history of the people who say buy buy buy firesale, before I buy anything. It can be a dead giveaway.

I'm also not going to buy stocks for any products I hate I don't care how shorted or whatever it is.

This is me talking shit and not advice I am a crayon eating meat popsicle."
2021-06-15 16:08:29,wallstreetbets,WISH is pretty much free money. Oversold.
2021-06-15 15:14:47,wallstreetbets,"Sir this is a casino.

I'll tell you how everyone laughed at me when I bought Gamestop at 13 dollars. Now I can afford to have a trump style piss party every night."

2021-06-15 15:43:06,wallstreetbets,"Lol for real. You can make money on bad companies. That’s why I basically throw $1k-$10k at all the tickets I see here gain traction. The strategy works b/c non-ironically apes strong together. 

To be fair only 1 out of every 4 that I see do I think are long term holds."
2021-06-15 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$ABNB DD - Waiting to explode over the next few months Hey Apes, Long time lurker of the sub, recently just made a reddit account as I think I have some solid DD! Not financial advice, just giving my opinion. Here's some reasons why I think Airbnb ($ABNB) is ready to 🚀🚀🚀 over the next few months:

* As first-world countries (where $ABNB generates most profits) have started effectively rolling out their vaccinations programs, ""staycations"" to different cities/regions within countries will go up as a lot of countries have international travel restrictions. 
* In addition to this, many large companies have are beginning to accept work from home policies, with employees getting tired of staying at home, and having no real reason to be in a specific location, staying in Airbnbs will become increasingly popular. 
* The stock started trading on IPO at around $140, and exploded to highs of $220, this is a popular stock that people can get behind. It is currently trading at $150, its a good deal right now - people seem to have forgotten about it.
* Over the closure of Airbnb in many regions, I imagine the company is silently waiting for the world to open up more and have a ton of marketing campaigns ready, furthermore they have 100+ new features ([https://news.airbnb.com/2021-release/](https://news.airbnb.com/2021-release/)) ready to go. They still even managed to attain $3.4bn in revenue during the pandemic, when the world opens up, I see exponential growth on this.
* I truly believe in the future, people will get bored of staying in hotels, as Airbnbs offer a more affordable and authentic experience. I not only believe the stock will explode in the next few months, but continue to grow in the next 5 years, it's a good company to hold.

I have only recently started investing over the last 2 years (I only have around $1500), but this is my first DD i'd like to share with you guys, tell me what you think! 

**TL;DR -** $ABNB is at a good price, they have been laying dormant over the pandemic and I expect them to explode with the world slowly opening up more for travel and their new features they have been working on; they continue to innovate in the space and I think they are a good long term hold."
2021-06-15 10:25:43,wallstreetbets,"Nice try, bud. lolllll"
2021-06-15 11:05:52,wallstreetbets,I’m big on Airbnb too. Already got shares and calls
2021-06-15 10:21:42,wallstreetbets,[removed]
2021-06-15 11:53:15,wallstreetbets,I think the stock may still be over valued. I say that as someone currently invested. I was a shill for it 2 months ago when I bought and it's questionable.
2021-06-15 12:31:34,wallstreetbets,"The recovery play is not that far out and if you have tried to book an AirBNB recently you may have noticed how many of the popular rentals are booked FAR out in advanced now.  My wife and I tried to book a few trip that were fairly easy to book in the past and recently have been struggling to find good stays that aren't booked up many months out now.  Same for VRBO.

Also.. check the daily chart.  Very nice cup and handle is forming signaling a decent breakout soon."

2021-06-15 10:08:07,wallstreetbets,Is this really a yolo play tho? We are coming off of a sell off floor from its ipo last year.  I dont think its been on the market long enough to find its true value yet but I like to compare it to Logitech.  They are in roughly the same tech tree but sell to different audiences.  Yes Logitech has gaming gear but not its prime target.  I also haven't compared balance sheets but I am bullish on crsr balance sheets
2021-06-15 09:45:27,wallstreetbets,CRSR baby!
2021-06-15 11:37:41,wallstreetbets,Must be nice to have tendies laying around to drop 7 figures.  Good for you!

2021-06-15 13:05:41,wallstreetbets,Loaded up today on the dip. Crazy how massive the potential is for the company over the next 5 years.
2021-06-15 17:03:42,wallstreetbets,"I treat CRSR as a bank, $30 is a safe floor so when I make money on more volatile calls I put it into CRSR shares. Probably won't drop much below 30 and potential to go up long term"
2021-06-15 17:16:29,wallstreetbets,"This is not a $3-4B company, it should be valued 10x higher if not more. The market is sleeping"
2021-06-15 13:35:54,wallstreetbets,Lol. This profile is 138 days old. What was the date 138 days ago? 1/28.
2021-06-15 14:56:51,wallstreetbets,Made my 20% yesterday and got the fuck out. Ill pick up more when it drops back to $30.

2021-06-15 12:59:24,wallstreetbets,Somehow I don’t think that’s the case sadly…
2021-06-15 13:30:12,wallstreetbets,I'm laughing right now.
2021-06-15 12:53:59,wallstreetbets,I am in for 150 shares.  But damn yeah down a bit since this AM 😰
2021-06-15 12:54:54,wallstreetbets,This biggest thing I saw the last time I compared the two is that Logitech is predicting significantly less growth this year than Corsair.
2021-06-15 14:55:42,wallstreetbets,"$Crsr is looking to post 2.2B in revenue this year at 25% growth y/oy and Is profitable! 

This should be trading closer to 5x sales (logitech trades at 4.2) not 1.7 which would put the share price at $101.5! 

Balance sheet looks solid as does logitech I don't see why they shouldn't trade at a closer valuation"
2021-06-15 13:06:50,wallstreetbets,And look how well Logitech has done… CRSR is Logitech on steroids. Massive potential.
2021-06-15 13:09:04,wallstreetbets,It was only 6 figures sir. 960k.
2021-06-15 16:38:34,wallstreetbets,Looks kinda stable tbh. Compared to other memes that got butchered today only 0.48% down. I’ll take that any day.
2021-06-15 13:07:18,wallstreetbets,Same. If it’s down more tomorrow I’m doubling down.

2021-06-15 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$CLF raises guidance 3rd time in 3 months from 4b to 5b EBITDA.. still very undervalued? The company now sees adjusted EBITDA for Q2 of $1.3B and FY 2021 of $5B, based on current contractual business and the ""conservative assumption"" that the U.S. hot-rolled coll index price averages $1,175/ton for the rest of the year

CLF is basing these numbers on an average of $1,175 per net ton of HRC. The HRC June futures is around $1,655. Which means there is a significant upside if prices stay above $1,175. So if numbers continue to hold above $1,175 then CLF will have to increase guidance again. They are significantly undervaluing the spot price so they can increase guidance again after earnings.

Key word: CONSERVATIVE 

With LG accepting an award for steelmaker or the year, [Laurenco Goncalves accepts award for steelmaker of the year](https://www.nwitimes.com/business/local/cleveland-cliffs-ceo-to-be-named-steelmaker-of-the-year-hailed-as-true-champion-of/article_69e3e649-6e03-5af0-bdf8-37301024ea35.html)

I feel there is significant upside especially as HRC is comfortably well above $1,175. What do you guys think? [HRC Futures Contracts](https://www.investing.com/commodities/us-steel-coil-contracts)"

2021-06-15 12:37:07,wallstreetbets,Boomer and meme stock = Beamer. Steel also comes in beam form. It’s a sign. Can only go higher.
2021-06-15 11:09:02,wallstreetbets,Go CLF
2021-06-15 09:09:46,wallstreetbets,All this is already priced in. CLF and rising steel prices and infrastructure spending are the most straightforward gain strategy on the market. It's a solid company and they're going to make money hand over fist this year and next. Everyone can see that.
2021-06-15 09:15:14,wallstreetbets,"Steel has been going for crazy prices this year, which of course means their financials will look great, but that doesn’t necessarily mean the company’s market cap should continually grow alongside earnings (it’s up almost 60% YTD) because everyone knows prices won’t stay high forever.

Similar to why UWMC/RKT haven’t seen massive, non-stop growth despite the crazy housing market the last 8-12 months"

2021-06-15 11:24:04,wallstreetbets,Could you explain in more details? I don't think I understand what you mean
2021-06-15 09:55:55,wallstreetbets,"Ok, lol. The recent spike in price is a direct result of ape pumps. CLF will be sideways + or - $2 for the coming weeks."
2021-06-15 11:26:02,wallstreetbets,It's TA. Draw two horizontal lines...and draw a sin or co-sin wave between those lines - that's trading in a channel
2021-06-15 10:00:52,wallstreetbets,How long do you think it’ll stay sideways
2021-06-15 11:31:42,wallstreetbets,"So, If I understand correctly, you could say, that the stock is currently trading in a 20$ - 25$ price channel ?and the fact that it jumps down 22 to 24 to 22 is not that big of deal?"
2021-06-15 10:04:29,wallstreetbets,"I think it stays in the channel personally. We could see as low as $19 again before it ends up around $30 in the next month or so. 

Not financial advice I still suck my thumb."
2021-06-15 10:02:39,wallstreetbets,"Literally said: ""for the coming weeks"" if not longer"
2021-06-15 12:58:25,wallstreetbets,Right-O!
2021-06-15 10:06:40,wallstreetbets,":) ty buddy
Appreciate you"
2021-06-15 10:05:35,wallstreetbets,.. no need for the sarcasm. I’m asking because I respect your perspective
2021-06-15 13:01:00,wallstreetbets,"Cool, thanks guys"
2021-06-15 10:09:05,wallstreetbets,"Ok, my prediction is that it will stay in the sub $25 realm for the rest of the year. Perhaps if infrastructure gets it on in the US (gov't) and passes a big package you might see some brief upward movement. But at the end of the day this is a value stock. There's really no growth here which means there's likely little to no extreme volatility."
2021-06-15 11:25:54,wallstreetbets,US isnt the only infrastructure passing this year theres several other countries so steels going to stay heavily demanded the rest of the year especially since china took away export rebates
2021-06-15 10:11:49,wallstreetbets,"Fair point. That’s why meme stocks are so in rn, cause most of them are pump when people don’t expect them to, leading to a shake up in the market.

Ty

With that being said, how does that affect meme stocks after they rip? How long does it take to factor in the value of a stock/likelihood for a stock to go up in value?"
2021-06-15 11:28:03,wallstreetbets,"Could be, US doesn't export much steel. Now that China might be a lesser player, things **might** change but I kinda doubt it.  
https://legacy.trade.gov/steel/countries/pdfs/exports-us.pdf"
2021-06-15 11:33:21,wallstreetbets,"Nobody really exports that much steel, china exported close to 9x more than the second india. That consumptions gotta go somewhere.


Thats just wrong, had to check it. Japan behind china 60mt vs ~30mt. China makes almost 1,000 mt a year and india 111 mt. Regardless, the cost of importing steel abroad is stupid high, US steel makers are setup to make out like bandits this year. Rebar prices increasing, HRC spot and future prices are higher than what even CLF is basing their guidance"
2021-06-15 11:40:03,wallstreetbets,Right...so that's counter to your previous point right?
2021-06-15 11:47:46,wallstreetbets,"Theres countries that don’t really produce anything, where do they get steel… it used to be china and now they need to go somewhere else. Im saying US companies that used to import from china will be using CLF and others. And other lesser producing countries could be looking at high quality US steel"
2021-06-15 11:58:10,wallstreetbets,"Mayhaps. I take your point but also maintain that the Steel supply chain is one of the simplest supply chains to predict and price into share price because:

1. Demand is very telegraphed
2. The pool of producers is small
3. Supply is very predictable

Due to these things I believe a quant would have little to no trouble modeling share price out a year or two."
2021-06-15 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,DraftKings: A $21 Billion SPAC Betting It Can Hide Its Black Market Operations 
2021-06-15 10:26:11,wallstreetbets,The ape in me is sad DKNG does in fact not stand for Donkey Kong. Guess I'll buy any way.
2021-06-15 12:24:24,wallstreetbets,Dkng $100 by Aug now.  Lol
2021-06-15 12:24:36,wallstreetbets,"There might be some truths in there, but they are clearly blowing things out of proportion for the benefit of their own short position, and lumping in “grey markets” with “black markets”, which is not fair.  It also is 100% speculation that the 25% Asia number was all from SBTech.  They conducted a single interview with one ex-employee who said “It has to be SBtech” and that’s it, even though they admit DKNG has multiple legal/legit Asia operations immediately after that?  

Again, could be some truth but they are clearly blowing things out of proportion here.  The worst part is their thesis on “Little competitive edge” other than their marketing and building a customer base, then just claiming without any evidence these kinds of customers will just leave and chase the best promos only.  It’s clear the authors of this report are COMPLETE IGNORANT NEOPHYTES when viewed as users; i.e., it’s clear they aren’t actually into sports betting, fantasy, and have tried and used multiple platforms, including DraftKings, to compare and contrast.  

Remember “Party Poker” and “Full Tilt”, etc?  Before the government decided to destroy those non-U.S. businesses on behalf of U.S. Corporate lobbyists, harming We The People in the process, they were KILLING IT financially, and all the did was advertise like crazy, give great promos to build a large community, and then no one wanted to sign up for a 100% deposit bonus on some crappy shady new site with 1/100th of the community.  DraftKings and other leaders/first to enter can do the same, and as someone who has actually used the damned site (unlike these morons who should probably actually get into fantasy, sports betting, etc and try different platforms before claiming who does or doesn’t have a competitive edge), I can say it’s a first class experience there, and there aren’t many alternative options.  Penetrating the U.S. market alone and seizing a large % of that business will allow DKNG to be very successful."
2021-06-15 09:12:18,wallstreetbets,Can't wait to hear their side of the story .

Here is Credit Suisse's take on it:

>Credit Suisse analyst Benjamin Chaiken, however, thinks the stock's move might be overdone, given that he sees minimal value in DraftKing's being applied to SBTech.

>""Our view is that SBTech was purchased by DraftKings for its tech platform rather than its existing revenue stream,"" he said. ""Said another way, if SBTech revenues were to go away entirely, we think there would be minimal impact on the DraftKings stock.""  

>""While not ideal, in a worst case scenario, an SBTech issue would not necessarily interfere with betting operations today,"" he added. ""We would use today’s weakness as an opportunity ahead of potential Canada legalization as well as New York, both of which are catalysts for DraftKings."""

We do not comment on speculation or allegations made by former SBTech employees.""

2021-06-15 10:49:02,wallstreetbets,Unfortunately CEO neck beard of Hidenburg thinks DKNG is engaging in baseless illicit activities. How about we let the fucking casinos/sports books operate and grow instead of making it seem like they’re selling organs on the black market?
2021-06-15 12:53:04,wallstreetbets,"I like how the report tries to equivocate “black market” and “grey market” too.  In any case, there’s a good possibility that SPTech was involved in more shady activity pre-2020, and began cleaning their act up for the merger and much of the data the report cites is quite outdated and irrelevant.  Like they talk about and stress Iran, but they stopped doing business there a long time ago as soon as it came up as a concern."

2021-06-15 19:52:46,wallstreetbets,If there is money/fines to be made SEC will do it - they love the publicity. It just depends if the higher ups at the company have power in Washington. Israelis are known to know lots of people - money is money and that means doing business in Iran lol

Most of this is focused on the SPAC merging elements of DKNG, which while it might have a case as the Bulgarian target seems shady, doesn't really undermine what DraftKings is or does right now as an American deliverer of a booming gambling market in a time where there is more money than ever available on the planet.

For sure they covered at the morning rally."

2021-06-15 10:29:37,wallstreetbets,"Those two organizations are poorly run. DKNG is a solidly run organization with proven growth in the face of legal maneuvering. Once states legalize, their scale will only increase. 1) profits > legality. Show me a multi-billion dollar company and I will show you a company that has done shit illegally. You don't grow to that scale without skirting the law. 2) The shit they point out is so far removed from DKNG its laughable. It's also basically breaking the law by not self policing. It's all about how you position yourself to skirt the law. 

Simply put, until they get legal ramifications, this DD is meaningless. Now, if lawsuits arise and governments start investigating, then it may be time to GTFO until things are settled. Otherwise, I'm still bullish on DKNG, regardless of what this bullshit says."
2021-06-15 09:38:08,wallstreetbets,"Being right occasionally doesn’t mean they are always right. A lot of their reports have everything thrown at the wall to see what sticks. For some companies, a lot sticks. For others, it doesn’t. They profit either way because their report is market moving.

2021-06-15 09:47:10,wallstreetbets,One quick Google shows the abundance of hit pieces they put out that ultimately don't come to fruition.
2021-06-15 10:40:23,wallstreetbets,"This research doesn't show this is a scam. This is some backhanded attempt to show DD. All they've shown is that DKNG doesn't self police. They haven't shown any evidence of actual law breaking, just that they don't actively pursue people trying to use their app in countries that have banned gambling. As long as they have minimal controls in place, they have plausible deniability to show they are actively trying to prevent the use of their services in countries that have banned it. That is incredibly easy to prove. If people skirt those controls, it's not DKNG's responsibility to pursue that.   


Nikola and Lordstown were two very shitty companies with literally no tangible product. DKNG is a proven player (and one of the biggest) in the market with increasing revenue to prove it. Nikola and Lordstown were both pre-revenue companies, those were always going to be a risk for failure."

They said the selloff is already too much and overdone even if 100% of the SPTech customers go away overnight, and are recommending a buy right now ahead of legalization in the U.S. and Canada.  🚀

I am also seeing unusual options activity that may indicate a 🚀.  While the in the money calls, and those close to $50, are understandably down with the stock

2021-06-15 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"[DD] $ASTS a Binary Bet with Deep Space Value #$ASTS 

&nbsp;

#Listen up dipshits and sell the lumber from your grandmas porch to get some free cash.

&nbsp;

#ASTS is a satellite company which allows 5G internet/cell phone connectivity anywhere in the world **through your existing cell phone**. In short, ASTS represents an attractive asymmetric bet in the following ways:

* [**Space Launch Market Competition:** It seems every week there is a new article about how cheap launches are becoming due to increased competition. SpaceX, Blue Origin, \(among others\) have brought space into the mainstream and are allowing for repeatable launches. Billionaires are throwing away cash just to win some twitter space race. The question here is; who actually stands to gain from cheaper launches? The International Space Stations 10 Astronauts trying to satisfy their coke addiction and a satellite company like ASTS.](https://i.imgur.com/8QqoIDQ.jpeg) 


* **Customer Acquisition:** ASTS works with existing telecom providers and does not need to acquire customers, pay for marketing, or gain approval for spectrum usage. By signing with existing telcos, all ASTS needs to do is launch a (patent protected) satellite and collect a check.

* **5G Fund:** $9 Billion in government funds are in play for rural 5G expansion. AT&T is working with ASTS to gain access to this money. Microsoft believes ~157m Americans do not have access to broadband internet. ASTS solves this.

* **Sold off:** ASTS has been wrapped up in a space market correction without participants understanding the value this company adds. At current levels “you” are buying in below investors like Vodafone and Rakuten who have all vetted this company and have a vested interest in the company's success. American Tower is invested and is essentially hedging their business against the success of ASTS removing the need for Cell Phone towers. *Take a second to look at their chart (and thereby the proliferation of cell towers) and think of Satellites replacing their entire business structure.*

&nbsp;

**What makes ASTS Different:**

[A comparison chart.](https://i.imgur.com/3jzbOoB.png)

[Something with less words for the High Schoolers who forgot their Ritalin today.](https://i.imgur.com/01RnI87.png)

&nbsp;

Iridium currently sits at a $5B market cap and allows for cell phone calls to be completed via satellite. This company serves maritime and oversees applications, charges customers by the minute (think cell phones circa 1999 or Roblucks(?) if you're the same high schooler) and requires a separate bulky headset. This is the difference maker for $ASTS, anyones existing smart phone can connect to their satellite as they rely on a larger high powered satellite vs IRDM which has a smaller satellite and relies on the headset to make up the difference. This same principle can be transferred to Starlink which has smaller satellite arrays and relies on a dish to connect.

&nbsp;

The average AST SpaceMobile satellite signal is powerful enough to penetrate two walls inside a building, the fuselage of an airplane, or the interior of a car or train. No direct line of sight is needed and the service is similar to that provided by a tower two to five kilometers away from a handset. The satellite architecture is completely different from that used in other systems. With each satellite providing coverage to a large area approximately 2,800km in diameter, a much smaller number of satellites are required to achieve global coverage compared to other systems and the constellation will be capable of supporting 5G speeds as defined by the FCC.

&nbsp;

AST SpaceMobile recently participated in the public comment period regarding the 5G Fund for Rural America. In October, the FCC formally moved to allow mobile-satellite providers that meet specified performance standards and other requirements to apply to participate with its partners in the 5G Fund auction as a 5G broadband provider. The 5G Fund will distribute up to $9 billion for 5G wireless broadband connectivity in rural America to close the digital divide.

&nbsp;


The first phase deployment of 20 satellites is expected in the second half of 2022 with coverage to 49 equatorial countries in 2023. ASTS plans to achieve full global mobile coverage with 110 satellites by the end of 2023 or early in 2024 with a total of 168 satellites by the end of 2024. Commercial service expected to be offered beginning in 2023 across 49 equatorial countries.
If ASTS proves to be successful IRDM would be an easy short ala long GOOG short YHOO.

&nbsp;

**What moat exists:**



[With 836 patent claims and growing](https://i.imgur.com/iTXb4VW.png), the company believes it has a five to seven-year first-mover advantage over competitors. A steep barrier to entry exists in the satellite space which these patents protect. ASTS CEO Abel Avellan has proven another satellite company Emerging Markets Communications which sold to Global Eagle for $550m. 

&nbsp;


Customers have already been established with ASTS. SpaceMobile service will be initially offered to 1.3 billion users. Vodafone has a 50/50 revenue share agreement covering its markets. Millicom, LiLAC, TEF, AT&T (including Mexico) and TEO, among others, already have a memorandum of understanding with ASTS. All of these companies have done their own DD on the technology and have signed off on it. This isn’t a question of if it will work, but when. AT&T has signed on for the exclusive rights in the US. They think of this as a potential difference maker in carrier choice going forward *(think iPhone exclusivity that existed previously).*

&nbsp;



**What need is there:**

Management estimates that 90% of the planet's surface isn't reached by wireless networks. About 5.2 billion people move in and out of coverage as terrestrial towers frequently fail to reach distant areas. There are 3.3 billion people without wireless data connectivity and another 0.7 billion with no cellular coverage whatsoever.

&nbsp;

In middle America broadband speeds are lacking as is cellular connectivity. This is why the government is looking to make advances in 5G quickly. Microsoft believes ~157m Americans do not have access to broadband internet.

&nbsp;


**Addressable Market and Costs:**

Cost of the service estimates for final users living in emerging markets could be as low as $2.06/month. Currently, carriers spend 80% of their capex serving 20% of their traffic in remote areas. ASTS could significantly reduce the amount of capex needed to serve unconnected areas.

&nbsp;


The development efforts to date and the equatorial project should cost $510M and the global constellation a further $1.3B of additional capex. ASTS projects to generate revenues in 2023 and become cash flow positive by 2024.

&nbsp;

With as little as 9 million users in emerging markets SpaceMobile expects to generate $181M in revenues and $130M in EBITDA by 2023E. Once phases 2 and 3 are completed, revenues and EBITDA would shoot up to $1.07B and $1.0B in 2024. At this point the company would generate enough cash flow to pay for its future expansion.

&nbsp;


**This doesn't fit anywhere:**

The Barclays Managing Director who did the due diligence for ASTS merge, Scott Wisniewski, left his job to joins ASTS as their Chief Strategy Officer. This mans job was doing DD on space companies and he left for $ASTS options.


&nbsp;


**Potential Catalysts:**

Research Coverage Initiated: As of now no price targets have been set for ASTS. Research coverage being initiated could result in a positive reaction for the stock. This was what set SPCE on a run (which this sub participated in) in January 2020.


Blue Walker 3: As of now the proof of concept launch used a satellite on the ground connecting to a phone in space. Q4 of this year will be the launch of their test satellite. A successful launch and test would mean the business will be able to go through Phase 1 and become cash flow positive. Someone much smarter than me will tell you what that is worth in terms of stock price. 

&nbsp;

**TL:DR** Max Bid ASTS Walk Away. Space internet on a toilet anywhere in the world.

Do you have any sources that can corroborate this? Also, even assuming that the satellite signal was strong enough to downlink to your phone, how do you expect your phone to uplink to the satellite through those same walls and then hundreds of miles through free space to the said satellite? Their website FAQ has a question ""How does the technology work"" and they literally just say ""It's a secret"". 

I used to work in satellite payload and antenna design, and I currently work with commercial cellular devices. I feel uniquely qualified to say ""this shit stinks"". If there's any actual proof that the tech works and is scalable, I'd love to see it."

Short volume is not the same as short interest. Also, the shares traded on those days went up a lot so of course short volume increased. Look at the short ratio. That went up a little, so maybe short interest went up a small amount. Look at short availability (10M now) and the borrow rate (0.34%) which tells you there are plenty of shares to borrow and it is cheap to short."

2021-06-15 14:28:21,wallstreetbets,"It's just a term we use as it becomes more and more available, suppliers undercut each other for large sales so it drives the market price down. For instance- chain link fencing would maybe be $0.50/square (1 sq ft, so a foot of 6ft fabric/mesh would be $3.00) we can sell jobs at $0.55 or more. But say a contractor wants 20,000ft for a solar field, we'll offer at $0.55, our competitor offers at $0.54, but we really want the job so we go down to 0.53 cutting into our margins. Well now the market is technically at .53/sq, so everyone is fighting for large jobs with razor thin margins. Originally at the beginning of covid, some steel foundries shut down making the commodity much more in demand, making the price climb, but production is catching up and soon when it's no longer an ""availability market"" (Hey, you have what I need and the contract is sold, I don't care what the price is!) people will go back to price shopping and driving the price down amongst vendors/producers."

2021-06-15 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Canoo ($GOEV) – The EV Manufacturer that’s ready to take shorts for a ride (healthy balance sheet, 30% short interest, 0.15% float left available to borrow at 24.5% fee, up to 11 days to cover - upcoming investor conference and Russel 3000 inclusion catalysts could send this flying) Good morning gamblers, 

**For a brief overview** - Canoo is a Los Angeles-based company that has developed breakthrough electric vehicles, with over 300 employees from leading technology and automotive companies. [link](https://www.canoo.com/about/) Their unique selling point is a modular platform purpose-built to deliver maximum vehicle interior space and adaptable to support a wide range of vehicle applications for consumers and businesses. This ‘skateboard’ platform is largely what drew Apple’s interest. The platform is different from ones developed by other startups and larger automakers because it integrates more of the car’s electronics, allowing for greater flexibility in cabin design. It also features steer-by-wire technology, which also increases design flexibility and is not yet widely adopted in the industry. [link](https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225026/apple-canoo-acquisition-investment-electric-car-goev)

Canoo is bringing its first vehicle to market next year with its electric microbus/van available at a base price of $34,750 before tax incentives or add-ons. It’s now taking preorders in the United States for the “lifestyle” vehicle, as well as for its round-top pickup truck and multi-purpose delivery van. Canoo is taking a different route than many other electric vehicle manufacturers, which played a role in the interest from Apple and Hyundai. Canoo’s trio of vehicles all have the same proprietary “skateboard” platform architecture that houses the batteries and electric drivetrain in a chassis that sits under the vehicle’s cabin. This contributes to a similar design language between the vehicles, which all have the same wide front windshield and relatively low profile. [link](https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/17/canoos-electric-microbus-will-start-under-35000-when-it-comes-to-market-next-year/)

A quick glance at its balance sheet shows that they aren’t at risk of running out of cash anytime soon. Their total assets are $717.8M (of which cash and cash equivalents are $641.9M) and total liabilities are $107.6M (of which long-term debt is $6.9M).[link](https://investors.canoo.com/sec-filings/all-sec-filings/content/0001558370-21-007431/goev-20210331x10q.htm#CondensedConsolidatedBalanceSheetsinthou)

**Does it meet key conditions for a squeeze?**

1. **High short interest: Yes,** ~29.7% short interest [link](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/GOEV) 

2. **Low float: Yes,** total float of 99.9M. 58.2% shares outstanding being held by insiders and 9.9% shares outstanding being held by institutions (23.7% of float) [link](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOEV/holders?p=GOEV).  

3. **Decent volume (also because of the high short interest there's a medium-high short ratio): Yes,** Nasdaq has the avg. daily share volume at 2.6M, [link](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/goev/short-interest), Yahoo Finance has previous volume at 3.8M and average volume at 5.4M [link](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOEV?p=GOEV&.tsrc=fin-srch), marketwatch has the average at 5.59M [link](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/goev). 

4. **High short ratio: Yes,** based on the volume numbers above – we’re looking at anywhere from 5.3 to 11.3 so shorts really shouldn’t be able to cover within the week, possibly even two weeks. [shortsqueeze 5.3 link](https://shortsqueeze.com/?symbol=goev&submit=Short+Quote) and [Nasdaq 11.3 link](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/goev/short-interest)

**Additional points**
 
1.**There’s room to run** - a squeeze would not initially be setting an ATH since the stock is currently down 51.5% [link](https://shortsqueeze.com/?symbol=goev&submit=Short+Quote%E2%84%A2) from its ATH with a market cap of $2.3 Billion. This is primarily due to an overhaul in management as well as a change in the business model which favored protecting Canoo’s IP instead of providing it to other OEMs, still ended up bring the SP down short-term since it was radically different from when they went public. 

2.**Shorts running into a wall** - 150,000 shares are left available to borrow at a rate of 24.5%, which is 0.15% of the entire float so shorts are about to hit a wall in terms of how easy it is to manipulate the share price. [link](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/goev)

3.**Possible PT** – unlike all the other information which is part data part speculation, this is **pure speculation** since we're talking about pre-revenue but I really think you could easily 10x the current share price if it’s a momentum based squeeze since it's a short-term event that isn't based on technicals. Valuations based on fundamentals aren’t really the same as they were a couple of years ago, and given the low interest rate / easy access to cash the question really is how high can it go? Since institutions don't hold the majority of the float (they currently only hold ~24% of the float but have increased their position by ~120% in the last month) and there should therefore theoretically be a smaller likelihood of shenanigans with lower price manipulation, this could easily 10x the current share price to $100 if more retail become aware of the company's potential and buy-in to their long-term vision, and additional institutions start buying in. Personally speaking, I like to look at market caps to see how high things can go – with GME and AMC both were hovering under a $20 Billion market cap before AMC blew open the gates a couple of weeks back. Other tickers that went up in the last week like WISH and CLOV however hit around a $10 Billion market cap before coming back down. If we use that $10B market cap to be conservative, that still gets us to almost $50, which is 5x the current share price – and since you can make a case for Canoo’s short interest being higher than the previous two cases, I don’t see why it couldn’t reach that by the end of the month, or even within a week if shorts start to cover and bring the house down.

**Upcoming catalysts**

1. **Upcoming investor day this Thursday (June 17th)**, which will be a ‘hybrid in-person and virtual journey into Canoo’s product portfolio and business strategy.’ [link](https://canooirday.com/)
 
2. **Canoo is being added to the Russel 3000 index,** [link](https://content.ftserussell.com/sites/default/files/russell_3000_index_additions_-_2021.pdf) meaning that the stock along with other additions could be expected to ‘trade more than their average daily volume in the Nasdaq Closing Cross on June 25, and some will trade an entire week’s volume on “Russell Friday”.’ [link](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/what-small-caps-should-know-about-the-russell-rebalance-2020-06-22).

On a final note, this is not financial advice so please don’t treat it as such – do your own due diligence, read your own news, study their financials and evaluate multiple perspectives (bullish and bearish) to see what others are saying. Don’t invest money you’re not willing to lose, and do so at your own risk.

**TLDR**:  Canoo is among the healthiest EV startups out there, $641.9 million in cash, only $6.9 million in long-term debt and a market cap of just $2.3 billion with a <$10 share price. This is the company that Apple wanted to buy and Hyundai wanted to partner with. Other EVs have the same market cap and may not even have the cash to make it through the next 3 months so Canoo really should be trading at multiples of where it is atm. Price is trending upwards – 11.8% in last week, 32.9% in last month – someone’s been loading up while it’s cheap (institutional ownership is up 119.2% over the last 3 months). Position – 1k shares @ 11.60."

2021-06-15 10:42:58,wallstreetbets,"This one could be a good one .. I'm in GOEV with about a quarter of my portfolio. The way I see it, this is the cheapest EV stock that has a chance of actually getting a car to market. If they sell even one of these, I think anyone who is buying at today's prices is going to be doing good. But it's definitely a gamble because they're in a super rocky patch right now - lots of questionable reports about employee ratings, turnover and executive departure, changes in plan and leadership. But that's why it's cheap, so I'm taking the gamble. As far as I can tell, there's no technical or financial reasons they're struggling, it's all just poor PR and drama."

I think apple promised some sort of EV around 2024, and what do they currently have? Nothing. But here’s Canoo with everything ready, except for a manufacturing deal (Apple gonna set that up?), AND a line of vehicles that look like something that would fit with Apple’s designs. I know Apple rumours have burned us in the past, but I can see a little weight to this type of speculation now"

I've been supporting Canoo for a while now, even pre-ordered their truck. There's a level of excitement the company brings, especially for folks that are into the latest and greatest tech. Imagine seeing one of those trucks on the road. Imagine seeing their lifestyle vehicle. Lots of people would probably say ""what the fuck is that shit"", but the point is, **lots of people will be saying that.** A lot of the huge disruptive companies are where they are because they were willing to disrupt. Combine that with top tier engineers and a good business model and you really can't go wrong.

2021-06-15 09:19:05,wallstreetbets,Just a note: major institutions lend out their shares for shorting to capitalize on the high interest. So your assumption about actual available shares to short based on a long term position of a major institution isn’t really accurate.

2021-06-15 14:39:02,wallstreetbets,"Good luck with this, just will point out that $600M cash is not enough money to get to production levels that they generate positive operating cash flow. By now you can look at NIO, TSLA, RIDE, VW, and perhaps others to realize that without a few Billion dollars they are facing a dead end. Not saying they cannot raise the money, but understand the challenges they face.

NIO for example produced about 20,000 vehicles in Q1' 2021 and had a $45M operating loss. If you look at their last three years since they started production, their operating losses are about $2.5B.

Companies like GOEV, RIDE, FSR are increasingly being bought up by retail investors who simply are ignoring the massive challenges in getting to production here (how many rounds of multi-billion capital raises did Tesla do? Anyone recall?). These companies are extremely long bets (GOEV is probably the best of these three) and the current market valuations are likely way too high."

Just to be clear, Apple has promised jack squat. Industry insiders are the ones saying a 24/25 target, but even notoriously coy Tim Apple has said things like they work on a lot of things that don't make it to market, there's no public promise at all yet, just a lot of internal testing. There's clearly a lot of smoke and interest though."

Additionally Apple is said to have already tried to acquire Canoo in 2020, but talks with the board broke down early on. With the chairman of the board now also being CEO, I would say the prospects for Canoo and Apple working together, though possible are unlikely at best."
2021-06-15 14:42:38,wallstreetbets,So the guy who was CEO running the ship left before anything is commercialized and is now at Apple and you think that implies something positive? If Ulrich Kranz had the chops to see GOEV to success why did he leave? I suspect that there were plenty of internal issues at GOEV that led to him leaving and going to Apple to take a different direction.

2021-06-15 08:08:39,wallstreetbets,"yea that's really the million $$ question, tbh I assumed with a change of management and business model they may need more time but it seems like they're still on track for next year's launch - at a really low price too (~$35k without credits) as well as showcasing the other two models they have in the works

if they manage to execute on time then that's really already leaps and bounds ahead of what most of the competition are up to, fingers crossed it works out for them"

2021-06-15 08:17:01,wallstreetbets,">Sec is in

If you have some constructive insights or a bear thesis or something to add to the conversation that's great but to just pop in and say ""Sec is investigating them"" is a bit shit of you. Do you have any additional knowledge or insight as to why or what might come from that investigation?

Lots of companies get ""investigated"" and they are only investigating the Executive departures not it's business model or claims to the public.  There were also a ton of lawsuits that all expired on 6/01 and nothing came of them.

Have you heard anything from anyone other than from Tony himself that the investigation was happening?  I mean there wasn't even a news article or anything about the investigation until it was announced on their last earnings call and they have indicated they are cooperating fully so it's likely a non-issue.

Canoo has proven over the last few quarters that it's doing what it needs to to stretch the money it received via the merger and reduce it's burn rate.  It's beat analysis expectations the last couple quarters and will likely have enough cash to sustain for the next 2 years.  They are going to manufacture in two phases, a contract manufacture and then build their own microfab which should allow them begin generating revenue before they start to increase their spend too much."
2021-06-15 07:58:47,wallstreetbets,"Yea a lot of EVs are, just want to point out this section from an article *'The SEC has also informed the Company that the investigation does not mean that it has concluded that anyone has violated the law, and does not mean that it has a negative opinion of any person, entity or security.'* 

Not surprised that some shareholders would be upset - specifically because it was an overhaul of the business model, but it was done in order to protect IP and add more value to the company by developing their own vehicles rather than licensing their tech out.

Here're some more details if anyone would like to read further:

Canoo completed 70+ crash tests and 500k miles. 

Lordstown bought their engines from a Slovenian company and the chassis is picked from the GM partsbin.

Canoo designed and engineered their entire platform from the ground up, all in-house.

Lordstown competes in a highly competitive market, and will get crushed by the F-150.

Canoo strategically picked niches where there are no EV entrants in the coming years, positioning themselves to dominate."

2021-06-15 11:48:34,wallstreetbets,Avg price of .30 - so sitting pretty even with where it’s at now. Hoping we see a price spike towards end of day and I can decide then whether to hold or flip these for a few hundred bucks.

2021-06-15 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$WISH Elliot Wave Theory analysis: we are currently sitting in the Golden Zone with a Sub Wave 3 target of $30 and a Sub Wave 5 target of $60 🚀🚀🚀 If we're in a Sub Wave 2 right now, then we are sitting in the **Golden Zone**.

Chart:  https://i.imgur.com/IFCigWR.png

Sub Wave 3 price target: **$30**

Sub Wave 5 price target: **$60**

> The Elliott Wave Principle posits that collective investor psychology, or crowd psychology, moves between optimism and pessimism in repeating sequences of intensity and time period. These mood swings create patterns evidenced in the price movements of markets at every degree of trend or time scale.

> In Elliott's theory, market prices alternate between an impulsive, or motive, phase, and a corrective phase on all time scales of trend, as the illustration shows. Impulses are always subdivided into a set of five lower-degree waves, alternating again between motive and corrective character, so that waves 1, 3, and 5 are impulses, and waves 2 and 4 are smaller retraces of waves 1 and 3, respectively. Corrective waves subdivide into three smaller-degree waves starting with a five-wave counter-trend impulse, a retrace, and another impulse. In a bear market the dominant trend is downward, and the pattern is reversed—five waves down and three up. Motive waves always move with the trend, while corrective waves move against it.

2021-06-15 12:38:21,wallstreetbets,Notice Bb staying up while everything  else going down. The $14 bb support is strong. Separating away from amc and gme trendlines too. It was riding their waves when it actually has value on its own.
2021-06-15 13:21:14,wallstreetbets,Like… I want to see a real Wish technical analysis. I’m not sold on it

2021-06-15 11:36:25,wallstreetbets,His entire post/comment history is suspect. It looks like it was a dead account for 2 years and suddenly he's pumping WISH and commenting constantly only on this ticker.
2021-06-15 09:06:58,wallstreetbets,"Sorry, I sold you those. My 10c isn't doing much better if that makes you feel better"
2021-06-15 07:37:10,wallstreetbets,Thank you for buying those from me
2021-06-15 10:50:11,wallstreetbets,Hello call brother.
2021-06-15 11:21:46,wallstreetbets,"Net operating cash flow has gained substantially. The company has a good motto if they capitalize. Ppl make bad calls sometimes. No need for your negative energy my guy.

Edit: also again, this is how we learn. You make mistakes. My max loss was 200$. This is not my mortgage money, that isnt bill money. It was piss away money on a gamble."
2021-06-15 11:29:59,wallstreetbets,"lol I throw money at meme stocks every once in a while and lose. Happens sometimes. Not mad, just disappointed."
2021-06-15 07:47:12,wallstreetbets,I really need to start studying the Elliot wave crap it is just so confusing lol . Having hard time plotting pivot points
2021-06-15 16:34:48,wallstreetbets,I’m out. Can’t do it anymore.  Pretty much it will be nothing left but shills and bots pumping the same garbage to each other
2021-06-15 12:23:35,wallstreetbets,Not so much :(
2021-06-15 15:25:42,wallstreetbets,"Ah, I see."
2021-06-15 09:09:34,wallstreetbets,"Im just vibin dog! Calls limit losses. Its nothing to be ashamed of, its learning! Made some great calls the last few months and some real bad ones! Thats the way of life (:"

2021-06-15 11:40:41,wallstreetbets,Yeah but people yolo blind and thsts not good. Its day 2 and he is fucked. Should not be like this
2021-06-15 11:43:05,wallstreetbets,Be first! I got in and out of TELL before it got to WSB. Be the first
2021-06-15 17:31:58,wallstreetbets,"here is some math to help you:

lets say you bought 100 stocks at 10 price so you paid 1000  


price drop -20%.. how to get out?  


if you expect the price goes up then you need to buy at the new price 8  


1% = 2400 shares  
2% = 1150 shares  
3%=  734 shares  
4%= 525 shares  
5%= 400 shares  


so to get out with 0 you need to buy 400 shares at 8 (3200 money) and the price have to go up 5%  


Double down is not enough.. so maybe dont yolo all at once is my advice. If yolo then do it in 2-3 even 5 steps giving yourself the chanse to get out if things go sideways. focus on not losing money or you will lose a lot of money"

2021-06-15 13:07:17,wallstreetbets,"Well you see, WISH has been bouncing up and down a bit at all time lows, so logic dictates that now it has to zoom past its all time high, as proven by some zigzag lines OP drew on the chart."
2021-06-15 11:46:52,wallstreetbets,I agree with you. Theres way too many people getting burned in pump and dumps. Wish long term is good. But the hype allowed people to to buy in at the wrong time. Even i got suckered in but i went for a moonshot price tag to lower my loss amount in the event it did shoot up. Im saddened to see the people who invested thousands from a loss of a parent or their college funds and now its next to nothing. I agree dd is essential. The other thing people are failing to recognize is that this forum provided dd and allowed you to make your own decision. Now its “buy this or that” based off of nothing. Hopefully people start making better decisions. My best play was 50c exp 6/18 on amc back when it was at 10$. Sold back on 6/2. Ive been able playing with house money for a little while which is why im not upset on these losses. Also why i do not post my gains/losses because this isnt a team sport. My money is not ours and likewise. I just wish everyone the best cause im a 28y/o hvac worker and bust my ass for every dollar i make!

2021-06-15 15:23:20,wallstreetbets,"To all those that bought into $CLNE today, I dunno who needs to hear this but back when AMC first shot up to $31 per share I bought in. It was on a Friday too, go figure. Big brain move there, right?

So it proceeded to plummet to around $25 by the end of the day. But I had patience and I held on, and on Monday all of a sudden it took off towards it's current all time high. 

That might not happen so quickly with $CLNE, but if you hold strong it will. The shorts have almost exhausted their shares to short.

What we really need, is a huge group effort to put some volume out there and stop the shorts from having so much price control. They barely have anything left to fight with, all it's gonna take is us staying strong together.

Not financial advice, but best of luck to you all."
2021-06-15 09:35:48,wallstreetbets,Remember. These shorts are trying to scare us. Hold and buy the dip and we’ll CLNE their ass out
2021-06-15 09:35:56,wallstreetbets,"Today's the day CLNE fights the hedge fund because they put millions of shares on the market to try to dump the price and scare you

2021-06-15 12:53:22,wallstreetbets,"Thing is, if CLNE doesnt moon in the coming weeks, i will just treat this as a long term investment, and build up a new, separate meme stock fund to throw at whatever WSB is pumping currently. Unless something big happens then the company will grow, only good news in the meeting yesterday"

2021-06-15 09:25:11,wallstreetbets,My gut is telling me if $CLNE can maintain these premarket gains today it's gonna take off as it continues to get support. Need some strong apes today to dig in those heels and don't let them push us around. Made some moves to increase BP to do my part on setting a new floor.

2021-06-15 13:12:10,wallstreetbets,"CLNE! We need to remember this stock is the smart money! So it’s going to be a FAST gradual climb until the gamma. So, think before you sell. “Why am I selling? Instead of selling on this dip, how about I buy more and average down my share price so I lose less on dips!” It’s smart money we are handling. This is SUPER hard to fuck up. Just don’t let your stocks control your emotions. After it’s in the stock, disregard the fact that you even had that money so it doesn’t make you sad. Easy fix."

2021-06-15 16:01:55,wallstreetbets,What a wonderful day for CLNE
2021-06-15 17:26:43,wallstreetbets,CLNE TENDIES DAY 6/18
2021-06-15 15:08:41,wallstreetbets,"Alright, last time I’m going to do this. For all you brains with out cells out there this is why CLNE is the play right now and what she does.

1.	⁠CLNE is the king of renewable fuel used in vehicles. They process methane waste gas from any source they can including animal shit and rotting fruit. They inverse the carbon footprint by processing this into fuel rather then burning it off.
2.	⁠Huge deal with Amazon to fuel their delivery fleet vehicles.
3.	⁠Hugh upside, low risk company knowing that green is the future especially under this administration
4.	⁠The price is right at these levels. Shares are better then options
5.	⁠Market cap is 2.5 billion, meaning it’s small enough to be bullied in either direction massively if needed
6.	⁠6/18 $50,000 worth of calls go in the money if the share price closes at $13 a share or above this Friday. What this means is that the share price will skyrocket next week when funds settle

CLNE is a strong buy. If if the gamma isn’t triggered, this company will do very well in the coming weeks. Therefore it’s a low risk to take for the reward. Best case scenario, we gamma squeeze and make money. Worst case it doesn’t gamma squeeze and we make money in the next few weeks.

Not much risk in losing money when you invest in a good company like this. Bagholders also recover and make money.

🌕🐄💨💨💨💨

EDIT: Stupid apes can keep buying the flavor of the day and keep holding bags or chasing winners and never get ahead.

Smooth brained apes can understand the risk/reward benefit of rolling profits into CLNE and make some serious cash.

Here’s hoping to strolling down Tendieland Blvd with you all next week!!"
2021-06-15 06:07:10,wallstreetbets,Oh I see how this thread works. You put a new ticker in and they’re bag holders. Then you replace it with another ticker and repeat

2021-06-15 13:49:32,wallstreetbets,"Why is CLNE safe, and meme-able? Amazon's agreement with CLNE has a purchase price of shares at $13.49 spaced throughout the next 10 years with the first batch of shares being available for purchase this year. That's roughly 23% higher than the current price.

The average analyst target for the next year is $15 - that's 36% higher than the current price.

If CLNE gamma squeezes in the next few weeks you'll likely see a quick 25% or higher return. If you purchase and CLNE doesn't squeeze, you can play the long game and likely exit within a year still looking at potentially a 30%+ return.

Positions: 100 shares at $9.69 (also for the memes)"
2021-06-15 15:00:39,wallstreetbets,CLNE needs some major volume to power through this BS
2021-06-15 15:01:15,wallstreetbets,"Finally understand CLNE weird behavior. Total is selling 500K to 1M shares each morning at market open. That's why it dumps every day at open with a big volume spike  then stays flat or slowly climbs. This is part of them reducing their stake to finance their JV with CLNE. Soon as Total is done with their sale, the downward pressure will stop.

2021-06-15 15:19:57,wallstreetbets,Someone just dropped a bunch of green on AMC
2021-06-15 15:29:17,wallstreetbets,"Remove Clov from the discussion and the market goes red, all y’all’s fault."
2021-06-15 07:23:50,wallstreetbets,Who is buying clov?
2021-06-15 11:05:05,wallstreetbets,"Alright, last time I’m going to do this. For all you brains with out cells out there this is why CLNE is the play right now and what she does.

1. CLNE is the king of renewable fuel used in vehicles. They process methane waste gas from any source they can including animal shit and rotting fruit. They inverse the carbon footprint by processing this into fuel rather then burning it off.

2. Huge deal with Amazon to fuel their delivery fleet vehicles.

3. Hugh upside, low risk company knowing that green is the future especially under this administration 

4. The price is right at these levels. Shares are better then options 

5. Market cap is 2.5 billion, meaning it’s small enough to be bullied in either direction massively if needed

6. 6/18 $50,000 worth of calls go in the money if the share price closes at $13 a share or above this Friday. What this means is that the share price will skyrocket next week when funds settle

CLNE is a strong buy. If if the gamma isn’t triggered, this company will do very well in the coming weeks. Therefore it’s a low risk to take for the reward. Best case scenario, we gamma squeeze and make money. Worst case it doesn’t gamma squeeze and we make money in the next few weeks.

Not much risk in losing money when you invest in a good company like this. Bagholders also recover and make money.

🌕🐄💨💨💨💨

EDIT: Stupid apes can keep buying the flavor of the day and keep holding bags or chasing winners and never get ahead.

Smooth brained apes can understand the risk/reward benefit of rolling profits into CLNE and make some serious cash.

Here’s hoping to strolling down Tendieland Blvd with you all next week!!"
2021-06-15 19:16:43,wallstreetbets,CLNE and WISH Tomorrow if you like tendies

2021-06-15 10:27:54,wallstreetbets,"Buying the CLNE dip. Get in early so that you aren’t chasing like a lot of ppl are on AMC, WISH and other stonks that have mooned. This is cyclical."

2021-06-15 09:23:56,wallstreetbets,"Facts:

1. Methane, being the simplest hydrocarbon CH4, has four hydrogens and a single carbon. This means that it produces only one molecule of CO2 and two molecules of H2O when burned. Benzene, for example formula C6H6, produces six molecules CO2 and three molecules of H2O. Benzene produces four times the CO2 for every molecule of H2O in its emissions output. Benzene is a major component of gasoline, and is highly carcinogenic. Don't be like benzene. Be like methane. Produce less CO2. Be less carcinogenic."

Remember, the VW squeeze lasted 4 days with far less moon possibilities and only hit $1000 a share. Our numbers are a million times better than that squeeze was and the shorts gotta buy roughy 102.3 million shares back!!!!! Yep million!!! We HOLD and watch the stock climb astronomically the first few days without selling a single share!!! When it hits $600k or higher, maybe a $1,000,000 floor,  we sell off!!! And turn these asshats upside down, and do what they have been doing to businesses and us for a hundred years or more!!! This is definitely not financial advice as I just love the stock!!!!

**DildoLegs**:  You send me yours tough guy. You messaged me  
**MoonArmy1977**:  You just proved how much of a bitch you are. We’re finished talking until you can man the fuck up and give me those details. Sleep good tonight bitchboy  
**DildoLegs**:  Why won't you send me yours if you're so fuckin tough?  I mean, I was done with this conversation 30 minutes ago when I told you good luck and I hope you make a lot of money, but I struck some kind of weird nerve and you wouldn't stop talking to me.  You're the one who said you would beat my ass. All I said is you wouldn't say the things you say on the internet to someone if you met them in the street. That's the problem with you youngns, safety behind the computer screen. And then you can make yourself feel better about getting owned by telling a stranger on the internet to send you his personal information which is just an absurd thing to ask  
**MoonArmy1977**:  1st of all, you said I wouldn’t do shit if I saw you walking down the street. That’s where you crossed the line. Now you’re trying to play dumb and spin it. No way you will give me those details because your a little bitch. You got called out first and it’s customary for you to man up. If you don’t, your just a little shit talking bitchboy and you’ll need to live with that.  I’m done unless you provide those details. Internet stranger or not.

2021-06-15 10:56:49,wallstreetbets,"Why does everyone think that the stock will go up next week because options expire ITM on Friday?

It's not like these are naked calls. I promise you, they aren't. They may have been when they were sold, but they aren't anymore.

Options writers don't behave like people from WSB. You assume that options writers will hold on until they lose money because that's what many people here do, holding options till they're worthless. At this point if an AMC call is going to expire ITM and it isn't covered, the writer is going to buy shares so that a certain percentage is covered, with that number going up as expiry approaches and depending on how deep ITM it is.

They aren't holding on for a miracle, like many here do with bleeding red options that expire in 1-2 days.

Options expiring ITM at the end of the week have largely been covered already, which is why we saw the run up yesterday.

The price rise doesn't go up AFTER the expiry date. It goes up BEFORE."

2021-06-15 08:30:47,wallstreetbets,It’s a good sign that CLNE shares available to short are nearly exhausted when they had 9 million available last week. The fact that we’re still going to the moon means they’re going to have to cover. We could easily blow through $13 this week.
2021-06-15 07:52:04,wallstreetbets,We expect pics or it didn't happen 😉
2021-06-15 06:36:03,wallstreetbets,I thought CLNE was a popular ticker virgin and we're popping its cherry today!? 🍒
2021-06-15 09:07:50,wallstreetbets,I'd like to believe we keep going up today ... gotta be the day
2021-06-15 09:15:31,wallstreetbets,"With you fellow
Ape.

Buy more"
2021-06-15 09:33:32,wallstreetbets,$15 today. I can see a shrek cock in distance

2021-06-15 10:49:33,wallstreetbets,full retard much success
2021-06-15 12:26:21,wallstreetbets,"I'm glad they had enough after absolutely destroying the premarket pop we had tonight.

Outside of the hedge funds that short the shit out of it daily there isn't mich holdibg it down."
2021-06-15 12:40:08,wallstreetbets,"Yup, I'm in for the long haul with CLNE, I could care less what it's doing today. It's going to blow up that much is certain. The question is when. Really what we need right now is a really high volume day to convert some of these non believers"
2021-06-15 13:14:58,wallstreetbets,If think you have time left. Don't worry.
2021-06-15 15:15:55,wallstreetbets,Need to trigger the momentum algos to get that volume. CLNE seems to currently be kept down by Total's daily share dump in the morning.
2021-06-15 15:16:29,wallstreetbets,"Apparently people don't like money, they don't want to get aboard to MOO MOO train!"
2021-06-15 15:15:54,wallstreetbets,Yeah many people are steering clear until the FED wraps up tomorrow. Volume will come Thursday and Friday. I’m not worried
2021-06-15 06:33:54,wallstreetbets,"For my sake, I hope npt 🤣"
2021-06-15 07:06:35,wallstreetbets,Both CLNE and CRSR are good companies and you'll be ok. CLNE is the now play though.
2021-06-15 07:06:42,wallstreetbets,Yeah I think I’m going to avoid Corsair and go CLNE
2021-06-15 07:03:18,wallstreetbets,CLNE is the safer bet imo
2021-06-15 07:21:08,wallstreetbets,CLNE is rock solid IMO. I’ll hold as long as it takes!
2021-06-15 09:08:02,wallstreetbets,Big $CLOV energy
2021-06-15 14:21:30,wallstreetbets,Possibly even tomorrow
2021-06-15 14:25:38,wallstreetbets,I'd be ok to just touch the troposphere tomorrow.

2021-06-15 09:18:03,wallstreetbets,Make em have to cover those CLNE $13 calls for 6/18!! They'll lose money and we'll make money. That's a win/win in my book 😁
2021-06-15 09:19:51,wallstreetbets,"That's right, apes are strong together and weak divided. That's exactly what they're trying to do right now is divide us. CLNE can and WILL cost them a lot of money if we can push past $13 by Friday and then it'll shoot way up.

#ApesTogetherStrong"

2021-06-15 10:34:14,wallstreetbets,There might not be a dip
2021-06-15 10:34:08,wallstreetbets,"Missed the dip, it's only going higher."
2021-06-15 13:30:08,wallstreetbets,Why 13.49 specifically?
2021-06-15 16:30:33,wallstreetbets,"I think and hope that it is. I hated to see it close lower than yesterday, but it does appear to be ready to climb. Moderate gains is what I'm hoping to see. I don't really want to see a big spike. That will most likely insight some big sells. We need the volume to hold and to hit $13+ Friday for these calls to me ITM!!!!"
2021-06-15 07:04:17,wallstreetbets,"We cleared it several times last week, yesterday, and in PM today. It's normal to have push back from sellers."
2021-06-15 06:53:39,wallstreetbets,we break it on market open
2021-06-15 13:39:41,wallstreetbets,"Calls will do nothing to increase the share price. Shoulda put that into shares. The way this os heading, if everyone buys calls they will all expire OTM"
2021-06-15 13:44:13,wallstreetbets,bought yesterday at 11.17 should i double my shares???

2021-06-15 15:33:22,wallstreetbets,Its the long term. It's being hammered to keep it below 13. Once this week is over it should start getting momentum. The partnership with Amazon is what people aee buying.
2021-06-15 15:35:39,wallstreetbets,CLNE [DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ns3zty/go_apeshit_on_cow_farts_then_make_a_clne_getaway/)
2021-06-15 15:38:56,wallstreetbets,"Posted this earlier. Also see the DDS posted in the sub. 

Why is CLNE safe, and meme-able? Amazon's agreement with CLNE has a purchase price of shares at $13.49 spaced throughout the next 10 years with the first batch of shares being available for purchase this year. That's roughly 23% higher than the current price.  
  
The average analyst target for the next year is $15 - that's 36% higher than the current price.  
  
If CLNE gamma squeezes in the next few weeks you'll likely see a quick 25% or higher return. If you purchase and CLNE doesn't squeeze, you can play the long game and likely exit within a year still looking at potentially a 30%+ return.  
  
Positions: 100 shares at $9.69 (also for the memes)"
2021-06-15 15:35:53,wallstreetbets,Avoid short term expiries. Everything else will print.
2021-06-15 15:36:10,wallstreetbets,Farts. Cow farts.

2021-06-15 19:27:58,wallstreetbets,"I think we retest $66 and close at $61. But there will be massive short attacks, no matter what new SEC law goes into effect. They. don't. care. because it's a computer that plans the short attacks. I think we are idiots because they may take a $400M loss daily but MAKE $2B daily, so we just don't know. This might be a 'cost of doing business' to lose $400M every day. Point is, tomorrow through Friday is going to be a giant rollercoaster. My tits jacked, and I am hoping we break 80."

With AMC we own the entire float, which spells bad news for them. With CLNE, they've exhausted almost all the shares they can short, and with $13 calls expiring this week, it'll really hurt them if those become in the money and they have to cover those shares."

2021-06-15 10:37:26,wallstreetbets,fr. Worst case you holding a stock that’s undervalued at 34. Best case it finds and surpasses its true value based on the financials around 70
2021-06-15 12:22:54,wallstreetbets,"Smart move was to sell right before ER and then buy back in. Many people were saying to do this, but were accused for FUD."

2021-06-15 13:43:26,wallstreetbets,Roll em or sell and buy shares. Maybe tomorrow will be different but the price is definately being supressed hard. Sell walls at 11 11.50 and 100k sell wall at 12. We need a big boy to come in and get 200-300k shares at once
2021-06-15 14:31:11,wallstreetbets,Lets go baby bboy
2021-06-15 13:14:32,wallstreetbets,Hoping your right. Feels bad not selling at 40 but I think it can go 50+ by EOY

2021-06-15 07:08:53,wallstreetbets,Better not be as I've had clne before it was cool and now it's probably going to turn into a big pump and dump
2021-06-15 07:41:08,wallstreetbets,50/50 could break 60 today
2021-06-15 10:19:40,wallstreetbets,Happens nearly every single day (except yesterday) for the past 3 months. Hang tight it will pay off. CLNE TEAM
2021-06-15 10:20:35,wallstreetbets,Still very early
2021-06-15 10:20:49,wallstreetbets,Keep calm and HODL. Rome wasn’t built in a day. We’re not even in the first hour of trading and the week is young

2021-06-15 09:07:42,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-06-15 10:55:29,wallstreetbets,But AMC money machine go brrrrrrrrrrrr
2021-06-15 10:56:22,wallstreetbets,Or buy both 👍
2021-06-15 16:01:27,wallstreetbets,CLNE is undervalued and a good play. It’s not really some wacky meme. You are right about the insane amount of actual P&D’s here
2021-06-15 16:00:57,wallstreetbets,"One of the 3 richest dudes in the world thinks CLNE is good for more than a day (on top of all the other good DD provided on it). I mean, I hope folks here make money on AMC too, but CLNE is a smart play too."
2021-06-15 16:11:02,wallstreetbets,in your comments you were just all in the other day... this guys an airhead move on
2021-06-15 16:08:35,wallstreetbets,CLOV is a legitimate play AMC and CLNE are also
2021-06-15 09:16:58,wallstreetbets,"wondering same thing tbh, know as soon as i buy will instantly go to $49"
2021-06-15 10:40:06,wallstreetbets,Might be trading flat this week but not dead
2021-06-15 10:43:46,wallstreetbets,"Not dead, just not the talk of the town for now. It's a solid company tho"
2021-06-15 10:44:37,wallstreetbets,"It has higher volume than CLNE, let that soak in."
2021-06-15 10:46:05,wallstreetbets,"They are doing great stuff as part of business turnaround and innovation 

BB as business far from qualifying as “dead”"
2021-06-15 17:09:49,wallstreetbets,"CLNE is a great stock. I’ve been scalping the past few weeks and each time I’ve collected shares for holding. I do see this as a buy and hold. After the FED speaks tomorrow, I’m jumping on hard for the next week or so. She’s going to fly"
2021-06-15 17:02:52,wallstreetbets,Maybe it’s the same people recycling the stock everyday like 🐄💨. i know i am 🤡
2021-06-15 18:23:27,wallstreetbets,Its all relative i suppose. Even 2100 shares aint shit.

2021-06-15 12:02:02,wallstreetbets,Time to buy some CLNE🚀
2021-06-15 12:58:46,wallstreetbets,Sell off all over wallstreet. If they say we good then all the inflation stocks will moon.
2021-06-15 13:33:01,wallstreetbets,12 is super swell
2021-06-15 15:49:40,wallstreetbets,Not amc
2021-06-15 15:54:21,wallstreetbets,Wrong amc is and always has been the truth and real short squeeze as well as gme
2021-06-15 15:56:51,wallstreetbets,Have you not been paying attention at all the past couple weeks?
2021-06-15 11:33:50,wallstreetbets,Not true. CLNE is green and people are buying
2021-06-15 11:42:09,wallstreetbets,Paper handed pussies
2021-06-15 09:27:50,wallstreetbets,Look at the 6 month chart! It’s like guaranteed money at this price point
2021-06-15 11:38:24,wallstreetbets,"It’s having trouble breaking the low 63 range, but I imagine it will later today"

2021-06-15 12:59:00,wallstreetbets,"Gl, shorting AMC is ballsy af"
2021-06-15 15:12:46,wallstreetbets,That’s too deep ITM.. try $200
2021-06-15 09:18:54,wallstreetbets,"CLNE is legit, wake the fuk up"
2021-06-15 09:30:13,wallstreetbets,"Uhm you really want to miss the CLNE train? You're right though, it actually doesn't deserve to be called a meme ticker because it's an actually solid futureproof company!

I'm in deep with  calls and shares"
2021-06-15 08:57:13,wallstreetbets,"There were times were people were saying BB and AMC are not real meme tickers and that we should only focus on GME. You gotta understand that WSB evolves, it doesn't stay in place and wait until you catch up."
2021-06-15 15:31:27,wallstreetbets,Shut the fuck up. It was awesome before gme and amc
2021-06-15 15:31:20,wallstreetbets,We are diversifying 😂
2021-06-15 17:36:46,wallstreetbets,Naw. Just too much other stuff stealing it’s fame at the moment. Holding!
2021-06-15 17:34:32,wallstreetbets,BB being a big bitch.
2021-06-15 15:28:29,wallstreetbets,🏴‍☠️🚀
2021-06-15 10:14:32,wallstreetbets,Well with that attitude
2021-06-15 10:28:48,wallstreetbets,You're talking about total and it's 500k a day. They have those shares for like pennies and are using it to pay for an infrastructure deal with CLNE. That's basically the volume of a 1m candle and it's the selloff you see at the start of the day. The rest is shorts and paper hands.
2021-06-15 12:01:55,wallstreetbets,They ain’t bags
2021-06-15 12:02:46,wallstreetbets,What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger. Hold till mün CLNE🚀🚀🚀
2021-06-15 13:40:33,wallstreetbets,Date
2021-06-15 14:26:27,wallstreetbets,Are you recommending we commit gambling crimes in a financial sub sir?
2021-06-15 14:25:33,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-06-15 15:52:50,wallstreetbets,CLNE is the real game
2021-06-15 11:38:13,wallstreetbets,"BB is a long play imo, it will always bubble back up to the top from time to time. never forgotten."
2021-06-15 14:55:41,wallstreetbets,Hopefully AMC closed above $60 either day a close im the green is a great day 🚀🚀🚀
2021-06-15 14:44:13,wallstreetbets,I think paper hands sold few days ago. We’re safe.
2021-06-15 06:58:04,wallstreetbets,You mean yesterday's
2021-06-15 06:57:22,wallstreetbets,So you're hoping for gains?
2021-06-15 07:02:25,wallstreetbets,"Llave me culo limpio means ""Key I ass clean"""
2021-06-15 15:40:18,wallstreetbets,awww come on... nobody puts bb in the corner.
2021-06-15 15:39:06,wallstreetbets,Just when ur ready to give up on it…
2021-06-15 15:50:37,wallstreetbets,Just cause we buying $CLNE doesn't mean we don't like $BB. I'm holding and buying more on dips.
2021-06-15 09:43:14,wallstreetbets,numbers dont lie
2021-06-15 09:43:58,wallstreetbets,100%
2021-06-15 12:58:12,wallstreetbets,*retail investors taking profit*
2021-06-15 12:59:19,wallstreetbets,Haha yeah Wish is a joke dude
2021-06-15 16:47:54,wallstreetbets,"That depends on share price, 80c is mooning if it's $2 per share lol."
2021-06-15 14:37:24,wallstreetbets,AMC is the play everything else is a distraction it’s not even that expensive Jesus clov ain’t it
2021-06-15 14:22:22,wallstreetbets,"AMC isn't even squeezed yet, good luck squeezing some random ass stock with no recognition outside of wsb"
2021-06-15 07:03:30,wallstreetbets,CLNE your room before you go see a movie
2021-06-15 08:58:39,wallstreetbets,Cuz we like BB
2021-06-15 10:35:35,wallstreetbets,It’s your fault
2021-06-15 13:49:02,wallstreetbets,Means no one is selling at least lol
2021-06-15 13:49:52,wallstreetbets,Just the set up for those of us paying attention
2021-06-15 14:30:13,wallstreetbets,Failing to see how CLNE a pump and dump?
2021-06-15 08:27:11,wallstreetbets,"It’s been an undervalued company for months and has been popular here for the same amount of time. Absolutely not a meme. Idk why people are jumping on it now, it moves so slowly and just waffles between 31 and 35 usually."
2021-06-15 09:02:30,wallstreetbets,Probably a question the regulators should be asking too
2021-06-15 18:34:26,wallstreetbets,Crazy. One of the faster growing publicly traded companies with a 1.5 price to sales and the setup to squeeze.. WSB would rather pump dying companies tho
2021-06-15 10:49:01,wallstreetbets,Dumb advice
2021-06-15 15:33:01,wallstreetbets,Buy high and sell low is your strategy!
2021-06-15 15:30:10,wallstreetbets,Do you have other cash? You haven’t lost on CLOV until you sell. But if you have some other cash for amc great
2021-06-15 15:47:20,wallstreetbets,"No, they have the backing of one of the largest companies in the world as well as the richest man in the world. You won't get rich overnight, it isnt going to spike $50 per share in a day or whatever. But it is a solid investment with potential to spike, but highly likely to steadily climb over time if not."
2021-06-15 15:49:26,wallstreetbets,"Uh, it basically traded flat.."
2021-06-15 12:45:02,wallstreetbets,😲🥱😁…
2021-06-15 08:56:59,wallstreetbets,This 22 day old account is highly sus 🤔🤔
2021-06-15 18:58:35,wallstreetbets,Zoom out past a week and it’ll fix that
2021-06-15 19:03:24,wallstreetbets,Please don’t put RKT in the same class with CLNE. CLNE is in a class of its own
2021-06-15 19:43:01,wallstreetbets,"Mortgage company boring 

Cow fart company sexy and funni"
2021-06-15 18:57:32,wallstreetbets,Yeesh dont worry brother the clners will wash away that red

2021-06-15 10:40:01,wallstreetbets,CLNE be like 😎
2021-06-15 10:40:25,wallstreetbets,"YESSIR! CLNE is the smart dumb money move! Still meme stocks but, it’s more smart so you can actually set a solid price to buy and sell"
2021-06-15 10:42:32,wallstreetbets,So you're just investing normal? Leave this sub then cause it's not for you. You're not retarded or an ape.
2021-06-15 10:40:49,wallstreetbets,… you seem pretty angry all your “big brain plays” aren’t working. Buy AMC and stfu
2021-06-15 10:41:45,wallstreetbets,"Lemme guess, you're a 4 month old account. Let's see

Edit: nope, 1 month. Cool cool."
2021-06-15 10:41:55,wallstreetbets,yet this is trying to be a subtle post to get others to buy into uwmc and clne so you can subtly hype those as safer plays acting like those aren't memestock right now too.
2021-06-15 10:40:58,wallstreetbets,It's sure looking like pump and dump now lol
2021-06-15 14:17:56,wallstreetbets,"From where? WISH is down further than CLNE today. IF you're not in CLNE that's where I'd buy into at 11. That's my opinion anyhow. It's not necessarily the short play, but it's upside is great with that Amazon guarantee at 13.49."
2021-06-15 12:24:19,wallstreetbets,AMC is my main squeeze
2021-06-15 12:20:45,wallstreetbets,Its not dead at all you just bagholdin
2021-06-15 08:22:26,wallstreetbets,It all amc bag holders weren't absolute haters of other stocks that have big potential it would be different

2021-06-15 10:29:19,wallstreetbets,That fast climb to 28 didnt help it but I think its going to start growing steadily all eyes on AMC right now.
2021-06-15 11:19:55,wallstreetbets,"It really just needs to hold well around $11-$13 until Friday which is when it’ll get pumped to shit and probably dumped in AH or more on Monday. 

It’s actually a LT stock though unlike basically all the other memes except for CRSR and SENS"
2021-06-15 09:14:20,wallstreetbets,"It ain’t CLOV bots, it’s momentum preparing for the impending short storm!! 🍀"

2021-06-15 10:45:43,wallstreetbets,Idk of clne would be bag holder
2021-06-15 11:00:43,wallstreetbets,There's others that have been pumped here that aren't doing so well. Only looking at the positives will turn you into a bag holder.
2021-06-15 11:44:55,wallstreetbets,Hold retarted
2021-06-15 11:45:53,wallstreetbets,"Stop thinking for next hour
Think of next weeks and months
That’s how I got in amc and never regretted it for a second"
2021-06-15 15:36:04,wallstreetbets,Cause it sucks
2021-06-15 12:00:29,wallstreetbets,"Ah, you must think they're stupid people eh? You'll see the way the game plays out in the end"
2021-06-15 13:45:35,wallstreetbets,I think anything at/under $35 is a good buy in price it got beat down in march but im looking at it staying above 35 i think we will see some more spikes to the low 40s till their next earnings
2021-06-15 14:30:39,wallstreetbets,I like the stock so much I got in at 39.75. Was looking great for a bit. Now I wanna poke it with a damn stick.
2021-06-15 11:23:10,wallstreetbets,You clearly don’t know how to play
2021-06-15 15:51:20,wallstreetbets,Cloves been dead
2021-06-15 11:40:55,wallstreetbets,I'm making good money with AMC and CLNE
2021-06-15 11:40:57,wallstreetbets,I should've sold at 28 :/
2021-06-15 11:41:04,wallstreetbets,Sir this is a Casino.
2021-06-15 13:54:21,wallstreetbets,CRSR could hit $50 by EOW
2021-06-15 11:14:03,wallstreetbets,"Exactly this bots keep pumping useless dumps, while AMC is literally the best Play, did you retards forget GME ? AMC literally admitted having naked shorts, we can send AMC to the moon, where are the real retards"
2021-06-15 12:11:40,wallstreetbets,Recoup your BB losses in AMC
2021-06-15 16:26:59,wallstreetbets,Mines in AMC and BB

2021-06-15 13:53:16,wallstreetbets,Like Hungary
2021-06-15 10:50:33,wallstreetbets,Read my DD. Strong company with good fundamentals. It’s a leader in its fast growing industry and has retail interest that can set this soaring

2021-06-15 10:58:27,wallstreetbets,Cause it's a solid play and we like the stock. It's possible to be bullish on multiple tickers.
2021-06-15 10:52:00,wallstreetbets,Because the movie stonk is ripping of course and can’t have too much attention on that. This sub has turned into a cesspool.
2021-06-15 10:57:15,wallstreetbets,"Don't be retarded. Wait...DO be retarded! I don't know, but selling CLNE right now for AMC seems...wrong."

That was stupid. AMC already up today. I sold AMC for CLNE

2021-06-15 07:16:06,wallstreetbets,"144@11.80 here, not really a bag holder since I'm mostly in the money at that price 😁"
2021-06-15 07:07:22,wallstreetbets,I got in at 10 so I'm feeling pretty good right about now.
2021-06-15 07:10:54,wallstreetbets,"What bagholders? Its been only up.. maybe a few people who bought at the top yesterday but since Amazon is gonna buy shares at 13,49... suit yourself ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|shrug)"

2021-06-15 09:54:55,wallstreetbets,Read my DD and then look at the performance of stocks ive previously wrote DD. I don’t write about stuff that is shit. CLNE got good fundamentals and has the retail hype to take it to the moon in a short period of time
2021-06-15 09:53:26,wallstreetbets,Honestly starting to think that more and more
2021-06-15 09:57:04,wallstreetbets,If we were to take some of the recent news... whats shilling about it? The deals they have with Big Oil? The deal with Amazon? The fact that RNG is carbon neutral and helps remove methane from dairy farms and landfills?
2021-06-15 19:18:35,wallstreetbets,Because it’s 💩. Buy CLNE

2021-06-15 12:59:53,wallstreetbets,"I’ve been buying CLNE since April. I’ll be honest, probably roll my $13s over soon. Still pretty even on those. Not selling any of my 411@ 9.96 shares. Still iffy on my $10 calls. Might ride them out and exercise depending on the support."

2021-06-15 11:48:44,wallstreetbets,Its still better than 95% of the trash stocks on wsb.
2021-06-15 13:31:32,wallstreetbets,"Because when it dumps (and eventually it will) I don't wanna be stuck holding AMC even at $20 dollars, let alone fucking $60."
2021-06-15 13:34:13,wallstreetbets,I'll admit AMC probably is the play for immediate tendies. But the downside risk is much greater. $CLNE is a play with a chance for some very near term tendies but if nothing happens it is a stock that will be trading higher in a year.
2021-06-15 15:01:55,wallstreetbets,I got 122 @ 11.33. Praise the cow gods. 🐄🙃

2021-06-15 11:37:51,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-06-15 11:42:15,wallstreetbets,Means that we own 98% of the shares legally allowed to be traded issued by AMC
2021-06-15 11:37:52,wallstreetbets,We own 120% of it
2021-06-15 11:41:25,wallstreetbets,Supply/demand. when day traders/shorts/paper hands start to lessen which they slowly have the price will be whatever we want it to be. We hold the float so we control the price. Some apes will sell at 63$ some will sell at 1063$. Not to mention ITM call options start getting bought out which ALSO creates buying pressure etc
2021-06-15 11:42:02,wallstreetbets,"Is that what happened with GME??? I seem to remember that the GME stock flew and eventually stayed in the 200+++ range, currently at 217.. hmmmm... so you are incorrect, my friend."

2021-06-15 15:46:40,wallstreetbets,Hoping for 13.50 ish some point next week and I’ll be good. Ideally this week but they’re hammering it hard

2021-06-15 13:11:34,wallstreetbets,80 but hopefully 100$
2021-06-15 16:07:54,wallstreetbets,No need to share who that is. Real CLNE players already know and respect his privacy
2021-06-15 16:02:05,wallstreetbets,Who’s the dude?
2021-06-15 16:02:46,wallstreetbets,"Ya source, im calling BS"
2021-06-15 16:44:57,wallstreetbets,CLNE (and BB) has a shitton (over 5m and 10m) of shares available to borrow. CLOV and AMC do not (less than 500k) and all trade with similar daily volumes (except AMC which dwarfs them all)... AMC and CLOV are the only plays looking good to me
2021-06-15 18:15:05,wallstreetbets,What price can we expect for CLNE in the near future?
2021-06-15 13:34:44,wallstreetbets,"Someone knows how to play along. 

13 is a squirt, scream."

2021-06-15 17:37:16,wallstreetbets,The panic sell feeling is on 10 right now
2021-06-15 10:32:41,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, but without a spike in price or IV it isn't helping the theta burn on my calls. I'd be chilling if I had shares but this is a momentum trade for me, momentum's getting killed rn

2021-06-15 14:32:13,wallstreetbets,"sure CLNE is a long term play, but not short one, everyone is in for the ""squeeze"", it will fall back soon, but long term it will definitely fly"
2021-06-15 19:19:01,wallstreetbets,\*dead companies
2021-06-15 18:35:26,wallstreetbets,"I really like clne but that’s it man, all these other companies are being propped up by WSB..."
2021-06-15 11:16:08,wallstreetbets,"AMC is the same play as GME, lets kill the naked shorts"
2021-06-15 16:10:43,wallstreetbets,NOK so stable it was basically the same as I bought it 🤣 that bitch wouldn’t move in a hurricane
2021-06-15 16:11:00,wallstreetbets,I’m holding onto CLOV and BB for now
2021-06-15 19:21:37,wallstreetbets,"CLNE seems to have a lot more commitment and interest than RKT just now in its early stages. Already 4k followers on its subreddit.

RKT is still at 2k followers many months after it peaked for a short time, so it looks more like Wendy's, a one hit wonder with a nice catchy meme that wasn't sustained."
2021-06-15 07:11:18,wallstreetbets,Sorry I meant 1 day
2021-06-15 10:41:04,wallstreetbets,CLNE’s by far the chilliest stock I’ve seen on the block
2021-06-15 10:43:27,wallstreetbets,4 year old account here: CLNE
2021-06-15 10:43:12,wallstreetbets,CLNE is not a pump and dump lmao
2021-06-15 14:25:01,wallstreetbets,I’m loaded on shares and calls for CLNE already
2021-06-15 11:59:21,wallstreetbets,Yall downvote me yet it bounced off it perfectly 😂❤️
2021-06-15 11:22:22,wallstreetbets,"I definitely agree, but really a tall task to sell anyone in here on anything that isn't a meme/momentum stock unfortunately lol."
2021-06-15 09:16:53,wallstreetbets,good luck brotato!
2021-06-15 12:43:02,wallstreetbets,The Fappening
2021-06-15 14:33:01,wallstreetbets,Hmm that might be the move
2021-06-15 14:17:57,wallstreetbets,Mooning to the middle of the earth
2021-06-15 13:12:56,wallstreetbets,"I hope not. I might be holding some bags, but they have built in fundamental comfort for long term holding lol."
2021-06-15 12:04:56,wallstreetbets,Lol keep dreaming
2021-06-15 11:05:05,wallstreetbets,"If you hold 100 bags worth $-100 and one bag that’s worth $$50,000 who has won?"
2021-06-15 11:46:31,wallstreetbets,My ape brain doesn’t look ahead more than an hour
2021-06-15 14:32:23,wallstreetbets,I think near eod tomorrow at the very least we will have some good movement because powell fears gone. Idk if itll be enough to put my 45c weeklies itm tho lol
2021-06-15 12:30:44,wallstreetbets,More like it. I’ve made more off of AMC in 3 weeks than I’ve made off any other investments this year
2021-06-15 07:05:51,wallstreetbets,"So far just WOOF, BB, GME and UWMC. But the day is still young 😌"
2021-06-15 10:50:37,wallstreetbets,"also, later today if it goes back up to 12 you'll see people praising it, so the people here are just silly"
2021-06-15 07:13:26,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, hate the naysaying in here. We should be all hoping for the best."
2021-06-15 13:21:26,wallstreetbets,Fuck you take my upvote
2021-06-15 12:39:55,wallstreetbets,"Look at his posts, he was shilling it yesterday.  What a clown"
2021-06-15 11:57:21,wallstreetbets,Just wait
2021-06-15 11:07:33,wallstreetbets,The mornings are when stocks are most active tho
2021-06-15 18:51:35,wallstreetbets,Tomorrow well know
2021-06-15 13:12:03,wallstreetbets,Naked September $85 PUTS 💲💲💲
2021-06-15 09:54:22,wallstreetbets,Been tryna warn people alllll week and they don’t listen.
2021-06-15 09:58:58,wallstreetbets,Is that why the stock price hasn’t moved at all? Because people are dying to buy in
2021-06-15 11:57:44,wallstreetbets,"I think bottom is lower, but upside is more."
2021-06-15 11:00:09,wallstreetbets,this guy is why the anti vaxxers exist
2021-06-15 11:07:46,wallstreetbets,"Oh I definitely started small. Yes, I looked at the loss/gain. I’ve wasted way more money on stupid shit with no chance of gains. LOL 😂"
2021-06-15 11:15:18,wallstreetbets,Thanks. My shares yes I went with a goal of $13+. It hit $14+ the other day. Just shot a little higher for options. I didn’t put much in on that but the potential is there I think. I hope anyway.
2021-06-15 13:34:24,wallstreetbets,[removed]
2021-06-15 15:47:36,wallstreetbets,Aight good.  I put it back.
2021-06-15 16:10:05,wallstreetbets,I don’ know I’m not sure enough people are holding or it to work
2021-06-15 10:38:17,wallstreetbets,I bought at the top again lol
2021-06-15 09:33:54,wallstreetbets,It does that middle of the day actually also
2021-06-15 16:22:49,wallstreetbets,But they had a short position before posting that news right?
2021-06-15 06:31:16,wallstreetbets,I already had that ticker you nerd.
2021-06-15 06:31:16,wallstreetbets,I saw something I didn't like in here but the user is approved so I ignored it. /u/zjz
2021-06-15 14:56:01,wallstreetbets,I might now though. 50% discount
2021-06-15 15:39:05,wallstreetbets,"53% SI of free float! Came from ortex bud, ortex told me twice in the past week that it’ll squeeze! Just like it told me amc would last month!"
2021-06-15 15:14:00,wallstreetbets,"i don’t understand a word you just said but, TO THE MOOON"
2021-06-15 13:35:24,wallstreetbets,My average in CLNE is somewhat high @11.47 so I'm holding for now.  15 sounds good to me.
2021-06-15 12:22:08,wallstreetbets,You are super defensive about CLNE... like it's your child.  Weird
2021-06-15 13:33:10,wallstreetbets,![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|upvote)respekt
2021-06-15 13:32:21,wallstreetbets,It will not dump.. you will see soon
2021-06-15 13:35:34,wallstreetbets,Not sure if clne base fundamentals convince me 😬
2021-06-15 19:41:33,wallstreetbets,Get that money!!!!
2021-06-15 19:41:01,wallstreetbets,Start with 5 billion
2021-06-15 11:47:50,wallstreetbets,HOLY SHIIIITTTT!!!!
2021-06-15 11:47:22,wallstreetbets,HOOOLLLYYY SSHHIIITTT!!!
2021-06-15 11:47:41,wallstreetbets,HOLY SHIIIIIT!!!
2021-06-15 11:53:36,wallstreetbets,Damn you’re retarded
2021-06-15 17:55:45,wallstreetbets,Because if you really think it's going to moon you can buy back in for less and have more shares. How much longer you need to see this same pattern over and over?
2021-06-15 11:29:18,wallstreetbets,How is it a troll when I said the truth lol...?
2021-06-15 11:43:09,wallstreetbets,Why are you adding a dollar sign to a shares number value
2021-06-15 15:48:21,wallstreetbets,Yea we can't compete with the them with out momemtum.
2021-06-15 16:04:07,wallstreetbets,Jeff Bezos. Amazon's deal with CLNE puts them on the hook for I think 20% of CLNE's shares @ $13 and some change.
2021-06-15 16:07:18,wallstreetbets,"He's actually the richest, Jeff Bezos"
2021-06-15 16:07:57,wallstreetbets,"Just look up the new Amazon deal to buy millions of shares of CLNE at 13.49, meaning when they sell they're expecting profits so probably valuing it at least $20."
2021-06-15 16:16:38,wallstreetbets,https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/04/19/clean-energy-fuels-and-amazon-ink-agreement-for-re/
2021-06-15 13:35:58,wallstreetbets,14 is a dream
2021-06-15 10:38:28,wallstreetbets,CLNE is going to take off soon. I’m not worried about her
2021-06-15 19:22:30,wallstreetbets,Well said
2021-06-15 10:44:26,wallstreetbets,"Yup, I don’t panic when I see these dips. I see opportunity to load up on more. I know for a fact that this stock is going to make me a shit load of money. If not this week, then next. It is taking over the fuel supply chain"
2021-06-15 10:48:25,wallstreetbets,So why isn't it taking off yet 😅 oh yeah there's nothing being dumped into it anymore. The dump was last week apparently.
2021-06-15 07:10:09,wallstreetbets,Lmao I like how you updated it
2021-06-15 11:08:52,wallstreetbets,After lunch est is bc west coast is waking up
2021-06-15 11:08:59,wallstreetbets,Never heard of power hour huh
2021-06-15 09:55:37,wallstreetbets,Lol the downvotes🤡
2021-06-15 10:18:38,wallstreetbets,"If you check historical data on the amount of shares available to borrow, last thursday it went from 8 million to a couple of hundred thousand. Over the weekend another broker reported it went from 3 million to a couple of hundred thousand again. And the stock only has 222M shares outstanding. A couple million drop of shares in a short time frame can really move it easily. And from the beginning of the month it is up a couple of dollars. I’m in for almost a thousand shares too and my cost is in the single digits."
2021-06-15 13:35:37,wallstreetbets,[removed]
2021-06-15 16:22:28,wallstreetbets,The volume per day is slowing down should pop soon
2021-06-15 16:33:50,wallstreetbets,Yes but it's not the same context as a short squeeze
2021-06-15 14:57:20,wallstreetbets,I would suggest you consider CLNE
2021-06-15 15:14:28,wallstreetbets,🌕🐄💨💨💨 Is that better?
2021-06-15 12:23:09,wallstreetbets,I’m defensive about it because I know what’s she’s about. Just go buy some fucked up shit like woof or wish like a stupid retard. CLNE is too good for you
2021-06-15 13:33:16,wallstreetbets,"Okay, RemindMe! 6 months"
2021-06-15 13:59:33,wallstreetbets,It’s dumping dude
2021-06-15 13:38:29,wallstreetbets,And $AMC does? LOL.
2021-06-15 19:46:25,wallstreetbets,I would give you an award for that answer if I had one to give. Best advice you’re ever gonna get here
2021-06-15 12:08:49,wallstreetbets,Yeah lol makes you think why is there so much FUD hmmmm
2021-06-15 17:57:59,wallstreetbets,And same pattern what are you talking about? It’s up 325% over the month
2021-06-15 17:57:12,wallstreetbets,Yeah and let the hedges make money from puts? Or allow them to hide any synthetic shares. Buy and hold💎🙌🏻 to the moon. Oh and you pay less taxes if you hold
2021-06-15 18:17:24,wallstreetbets,"Nice try shill. Putting any of our shares up for sale only helps the short sellers. They are trying to buy as many as they can right now so they have less to buy when we lift off!!!! HOLD and buy the yummy dip!!! We own roughy 98% of the available shares, 300% of the float, and they need roughly 102.3 million of our shares. We HOLD and HOLD and HOLD and watch the share price go up and up for days before we even consider selling one share. VW squeeze lasted 4 days and our numbers are astronomically better than that squeeze!! My floor is $600,000. That will go up the more and more they try to cheat us, and drag out the inevitable!!! Every week that goes by, my SELL button gets smaller and smaller and harder and harder to push!!! This is most definitely not financial advice. I just love AMC and the stock!!!!"
2021-06-15 11:31:15,wallstreetbets,I see your comments in here hating on CLNE. What is your thesis? What do you know about CLNE? What bags do you carry??
2021-06-15 15:53:52,wallstreetbets,if only those dumbasses that bought WOOF bought CLNE
2021-06-15 16:09:06,wallstreetbets,Thats gonna be a big maybe. Watch the shit get dumped as soon as it happens.
2021-06-15 16:29:05,wallstreetbets,"Wow, duh. My bad, thanks for educating my airhead ass! :D"
2021-06-15 16:17:42,wallstreetbets,"True, but I keep hearing Elon is sneaking up on him and dont like to assume."
2021-06-15 13:39:50,wallstreetbets,15 is a gif scene.
2021-06-15 10:49:34,wallstreetbets,What are you 2 days old? You can’t even wait till your done taking a shit to make money?
2021-06-15 10:50:45,wallstreetbets,"Oh I donno, maybe because the market is garbage rn, there is strong interest to keep it below $13 before Friday, there is 10,000 bots pumping nonsense tickets over good DD here everyday, honestly take your pick brother"
2021-06-15 09:56:12,wallstreetbets,"Yup, that just means everyone’s in agreement 😂😂😂"
2021-06-15 10:20:42,wallstreetbets,"Ok, post dem positions then."
2021-06-15 13:37:18,wallstreetbets,[removed]
2021-06-15 16:23:59,wallstreetbets,I bloody hope so. I’m stuck at 22.5 and I’d take 20 at this point
2021-06-15 17:58:14,wallstreetbets,"Damn, I f’d up then. Everyone hates me now."
2021-06-15 15:16:52,wallstreetbets,"much. thank you. also could you dumb down the part about 6/18, what exactly is happening then and why is it gonna make me rich"
2021-06-15 12:25:30,wallstreetbets,Na you're super defensive about it because you're weird
2021-06-15 13:33:49,wallstreetbets,"From my lambo, will do 😉"
2021-06-15 14:00:18,wallstreetbets,At somepoint yes 😅 but after 🌝
2021-06-15 13:39:20,wallstreetbets,"As you said, immediate tendies 😉"
2021-06-15 13:05:44,wallstreetbets,FUD? IS FEAR AND DOUBT?
2021-06-15 18:01:51,wallstreetbets,"Sharp rise on Tues/Weds as MM's need to buy to hedge against upcoming call options that may expire ITM. Slow trickle down afterwards as people sell to take profits, and then a dump by Friday as MMs sell the shares they no longer need for hedging.

Rinse-repeat."
2021-06-15 17:59:31,wallstreetbets,"Dude none of this shit is real, it's all investing Qanon. Read these posts, half the people here don't even know how this stuff works. People think MMs are writing naked call contracts and keeping them naked right up to expiry. The whole theory is flawed and based on a misunderstanding of how this works."
2021-06-15 18:56:22,wallstreetbets,You guys are literally the Qanon of investing.
2021-06-15 11:36:00,wallstreetbets,I have CLNE that still goes nowhere and stuck in Limbo LOL. Waiting for that volume to show up still...
2021-06-15 11:34:36,wallstreetbets,21 < 45 For volume. When is it supposed to be over average now?
2021-06-15 16:14:47,wallstreetbets,"It’s not a maybe. They can’t own more than 5% at a time, so dumping would be dumb for them. They’d lose money in the future. It’s in their best interest to pump it as high as possible"
2021-06-15 16:12:51,wallstreetbets,Why would amazon dump it when they made a partnership deal and why would anyone else? amazon will fuel the stock higher... you really are an airhead
2021-06-15 10:50:47,wallstreetbets,Anything pushed here is momentum stock. Imagine thinking long term stocks exist here lol...
2021-06-15 10:51:20,wallstreetbets,You just answered to its worthlessness lol
2021-06-15 10:39:21,wallstreetbets,Not to be dumb but whats the easiest way to post screenshot
2021-06-15 13:38:52,wallstreetbets,[removed]
2021-06-15 15:21:00,wallstreetbets,"$50,000 worth of calls are in play for a $13 strike on 6/18. If they go ITM (In the money) meaning we close at or above the $13 a share this Friday, Hedge funds are in big trouble. This could spark not only a squeeze, but a gamma squeeze. I’m not someone who uses that word loosely. A real gamma is on the table if the stars align just right. Shares are the best thing to buy because they move the price more then options do. Does this make sense? I tried to dumb it down a bit"
2021-06-15 12:26:43,wallstreetbets,"Obviously you don’t have a brain. Turn around and clean up your toys, you’re running late for school"
2021-06-15 13:34:19,wallstreetbets,Good luck(:
2021-06-15 16:31:30,wallstreetbets,What is mooning to you ?
2021-06-15 18:03:42,wallstreetbets,"🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️whatever is happening I’m up 280% and it still keeps moving. On a day where there was so much red amc was green. Sorry you missed out or are losing money from puts but you aren’t going to get me to sell. I bet you where one of the people that have been saying this
Was going to go to back to below 8 since the movement started."
2021-06-15 11:36:45,wallstreetbets,Maybe you should stop talking shit on it and stick with the positive. Unless you don’t hold CLNE
2021-06-15 11:35:22,wallstreetbets,So I’m assuming you don’t have answers to those questions?
2021-06-15 11:37:17,wallstreetbets,avg volume is not 45M lmao check again
2021-06-15 16:18:04,wallstreetbets,"Amazon wouldn't dump it, apes would dump it"
2021-06-15 10:52:08,wallstreetbets,"I take it the only momentum plays you’ve seen are AMC and GME, because CLNE sure looks like a momentum play"
2021-06-15 10:54:04,wallstreetbets,"I mean hey dude, if you don’t want to make money and join a good value play do whatever you want, but if you did any research at all, you know it isn’t. But keep buying AMC at $60 and see how that works out for ya"
2021-06-15 10:48:47,wallstreetbets,"Haha you gotta upload to Imgur then hyperlink it to Reddit.  You ain’t gotta do all that tho, I’m just messing around.  Just saying be careful that you don’t go back down to holding those stock at single digits again.  Cover your ass with credit if you really believe in the long term potential and not in it for a fake “squeeze” or “short”"
2021-06-15 15:24:34,wallstreetbets,"i mean i can’t lie i’m a complete beginner, clne and virgin galactic are my first 2 “investments” but yea that makes more sense. i heard the term short squeeze a ton when gme was the big thing in this sub but i haven’t heard gamma squeeze until now, but it seems like i’m in the right position currently"
2021-06-15 12:27:49,wallstreetbets,Sick burn bro
2021-06-15 18:05:40,wallstreetbets,"I am up 10,000% on AMC because I sell when it's high and buy when it's low."
2021-06-15 11:43:53,wallstreetbets,So much positive happening now
2021-06-15 11:41:45,wallstreetbets,"The average is share volume, not money value LOL. The average shares is 45M for CLNE..."
2021-06-15 10:52:37,wallstreetbets,Yeah that momentum for CLNE wasn't much. It's over.

2021-06-15 15:32:23,wallstreetbets,"just somethin light, i put $50 in yesterday after market at 11.17 and when it hit 10.90 today i was thinking about doubling that and putting in another 50"
2021-06-15 12:33:19,wallstreetbets,"You read some other person's DD on a stock, let it convince you it was a good idea to put a couple thousand dollars into it, then hurl insults at anybody who says it's a bad play?  Super weird"

Melvin Capital is going to throw a lot of tricks at us that will make it look like the stock is dropping. Don't fall for it.

Do not sell if you see any of these things happen:

GME drops by 30% or more after hours

SEC filings show that shorts have all exited their positions

GME drops below $1 a share

The Gamestop locations near you start closing

GME files for bankruptcy

GME is delisted from the stock exchange

Your bank forecloses on your home for late payment

Your children have children of their own who grow up and become investment bankers and tell you that you should stop telling people you're ""diamond handing"" a company that went out of business 30 years ago

These are classic hedge fund tricks."

Note, transitory is an open-ended term with no set duration. It can be one year or five years.  As such, rates will remain low for a longer period than pundits in the media have guessed. With 600,000+ Covid-19 deaths, we remain in the 1st inning of a recovery and accommodating is here to stay. -Jerome Powell"

2021-06-15 09:01:07,wallstreetbets,Because people like getting products that are flop-sequels based on the true story of the product in the picture.
2021-06-15 09:04:30,wallstreetbets,"The thesis is that it's hit bottom and the freefall left it heavily undervalued, so we're due for a positive correction. A lot of professional analysts seem to see it as an easy buy and rate it as worth 17+."
2021-06-15 09:23:24,wallstreetbets,"I think it still has a lot of room... very low availability of shares.... lots of eyes on it.... bout to have a confrence in 8 minutes.... 

WOOF.... Market Cap: $8.5 Billion, Forward PE: 34  
CHWY.... Market Cap: $31 Billion, Forward PE: 214  
Only up 17.86% yesterday which is nothing given the SI and the lockup  
Still LOTS of room to go...."

2021-06-15 08:05:35,wallstreetbets,At a certain point you have too much money to be able to spend on good trades. You can’t buy billions of dollars in the next GME because then you would just own it all yourself.

2021-06-15 07:23:21,wallstreetbets,I would say hold and see what happens this week.
2021-06-15 05:57:46,wallstreetbets,AMC could redeem you

Also, remember it’s just money my dude!"
2021-06-15 10:49:08,wallstreetbets,"It's only down for now you still at least have some time left before expiration. Patience could be what's needed. Patience kills me by the way... Not my strong point but any means, but I'm trying to figure it out."
2021-06-15 11:33:31,wallstreetbets,Down on NVDA calls lol how is that possible
2021-06-15 11:41:04,wallstreetbets,Since you’re so adept at finding the top you should look into puts.

2021-06-15 07:29:05,wallstreetbets,I'd rather learn with less of a loss 😂
2021-06-15 07:05:25,wallstreetbets,This is MAJOR facts.
2021-06-15 10:51:20,wallstreetbets,This is why you learn with three digit bets instead of five.
2021-06-15 08:39:19,wallstreetbets,Hold what? They are options that expire after the specified time. There is no hold for options. Only exercise/sell/expire
2021-06-15 06:18:12,wallstreetbets,What is the play/ way to make AMC work? I want to jump on the bandwagon but I feel like im waaaaay late to the game

2021-06-15 09:39:05,wallstreetbets,But if it was less of a loss would you have learned? 🤔
2021-06-15 09:24:14,wallstreetbets,"I stg this guy is a bot, I see him on every thread"
2021-06-15 10:40:53,wallstreetbets,People thought they were late to the game was GME was at $50.. just keep that in mind.
2021-06-15 06:27:46,wallstreetbets,I'd wait for the next dip in the $40s no Financial Advise but $40 good entry point in my opinion
2021-06-15 09:43:06,wallstreetbets,"At any loss I would have learned lol who the hell likes losing money, whether it's $200 or $20,000"
2021-06-15 09:50:47,wallstreetbets,"But if it was more of a learn, would you have loss of a less?"
2021-06-15 06:33:19,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the input, i appreciate it!"
2021-06-15 09:45:58,wallstreetbets,If you don't like losing money look at a call put spread.  You can feel like a big boy playing with options but hedge all your bets so you don't lose
2021-06-15 09:44:33,wallstreetbets,Then your dumbass should not have played with options.

This is what this sub should get back to being about."
2021-06-15 06:01:18,wallstreetbets,"Some TA for you: price broke of that bullish expanding triangle, the worrying factor is the momentum is not that strong despite heavy volume on daily. If tomorrow is red, NIO will  most likely return back to retest the 32.80$ level in that case your calls are doomed. Yesterday at Close SPY showed some very good momentum which might make much of the market green today including NIO in that case we will be looking at next resistance of 49.75 and also on the 4 hour it looks like NIO price action is healthy after breaking that triangle. 60$ is highly unlikely tho unless there is some PR on the way."
2021-06-15 06:42:15,wallstreetbets,Those calls are going to start decaying real fast. Keep an eye on em
2021-06-15 10:36:49,wallstreetbets,"i bought nio too, did some quality DD first though.

opened the website and thought ""looks like a chinese tesla"" followed by ""ooh nice website"" and ""norway"".

smooth brain that i am.

bought some XPENG too because they sound like they know what they are doing and are reporting many cars sold."
2021-06-15 06:25:04,wallstreetbets,Also have shares in Nio my best choice yet holding till $100+
2021-06-15 05:53:26,wallstreetbets,Good luck on your tickets !
2021-06-15 11:23:01,wallstreetbets,Is there news soon?
2021-06-15 05:39:28,wallstreetbets,we don't do NIO here dude ..............
2021-06-15 07:25:50,wallstreetbets,Those 60$ contracts are not even a lotto ticket... maybe some toilet paper 😂😂
2021-06-15 05:44:05,wallstreetbets,We do whatever makes us money here.
2021-06-15 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Should I short Apple and Walmart (or any other China import heavy companies) So this is happening right now, but the G7 summit just unanimously said China is bad news.  They listed out several reasons and China basically said that’s cap and said that they view the United States as having “sinister intentions.”  So like cool, China drama happens all the time right? But here is where it gets interesting, while the G7 shat on them we started moving a navy carrier group into the South China Sea.  Now this is a routine war drill type thing, but it has always increased tensions.  If you remember a few years back China started increasing their claim to this sea by building artificial islands.  After we just condemned them for human rights violations, supported Hong Kong, and recognized them as a threat due to their growing presence; will they take nicely to our navy in waters that they believe are theirs?  When there were just rumors about a trade war apple stock dropped 4% in one afternoon, and since cell technology is the biggest import from China any event would cause large damage to this industry.  As well as Walmart having 80% of their products from China both are almost reliant and shit bricks over 10% tariff. We don’t really recognize these islands and the territorial waters that come with typically sail through them, but not typically at a time like this.  If this provokes a response I think it might drop? Idk i am kinda retarded, but I bet on space etfs before ufo report and made 50% on calls, and that was far more retarded."
2021-06-15 05:26:37,wallstreetbets,"There can be lots of talk and posturing, but at the end of the day, the economies of the USA and PRC are interdependent. Both sides know this."
2021-06-15 05:20:09,wallstreetbets,"I think shorting is an overall bad strategy. They can announce a new product with no intention to fulfill and get that price up. Don't trust the market. Its a casino. This is not financial advice, I dont like any stock"

2021-06-15 09:20:56,wallstreetbets,The west is all cannon and no balls right now. And don’t short the greatest brand of the last half century.
2021-06-15 05:44:12,wallstreetbets,"No.

In German you would say: The soup is always eaten colder than it is cooked.

If anything, take it as another risk dimension to check before taking up long positions."

2021-06-15 11:57:31,wallstreetbets,"It is impossible to have any sort conflict right now, the world is trying to come back from COVID and is in recovery mood

China is under pressure from the rest of the world as well for numerous things, the survival of China depends on it’s manufacturing and export industry and I don’t think that is something they are willing to risk. 

China will always be like the possum in the corner that will snarl and show it’s teeth when it feels threatened when reality it’s all for show

Walmart is pulling out of China they have been for awhile now, you’ll see more things from Cambodia, Vietnam and India on the shelves

India has also offered incentives for companies that manufacture in India, so that leaves plenty of opportunities for Walmart and other companies exiting China"
2021-06-15 06:18:36,wallstreetbets,Go ahead and short Apple.. you will get burned. We’re in a bull market and Apple announced their continued effort to purchase their own stock.
2021-06-15 05:21:56,wallstreetbets,"This is just another drama. They will curse each other and probably shoot few rockets, but will never go full scale wars. 
If the market drops due to the FUD, it is time to buy more."
2021-06-15 05:37:27,wallstreetbets,Calls on VIX a safer bet?
2021-06-15 05:37:31,wallstreetbets,"I think you could be right about certain corners of the market getting spooked over something like this. However, any impact to the market would likely be short lived as Both economies are heavily interdependent. You would be taking a big risk shorting 2 of the Largest and most successful US companies, both of which have been consolidating for months. All it takes is news of a promising peace agreement to come out and your thesis is toast. I’m not saying you’re wrong, I’m just saying that there are better horses to bet on."
2021-06-15 06:32:19,wallstreetbets,"A lot of retailers and suppliers have also found more local alternatives and back up suppliers as an alternative to China in the last 18 months because of concerns, shipping back logs and other related issues with COVID.

Although this won’t obviously relieve all issues with regulations or restrictions possible put on China it will lessen the impact.

That along with you don’t really know if and when the impact of this would take place it’s a big gamble.  But if your gambling on little green men maybe this isn’t too far off for you."
2021-06-15 06:16:10,wallstreetbets,"Hell no. China doesn't want that smoke right now, China will chat shit all day but they aren't doing anything real. Over the last 2 years they've thrown away all the soft power they spent the last decade accumulating as they bought into their own hype too much, now shits getting real and the truth is they need import more than the rest of the world needs their export, so they're fucked."
2021-06-15 05:45:13,wallstreetbets,"Maybe sell some CCs or PMCCs, but you got all that SPCE money so it'll be CCs I assume."
2021-06-15 05:46:30,wallstreetbets,"Not really. America could actually just start doing more business with mexico. Its cheaper. Faster. And more friendly to the environment due to less emissions from shipping.

Why this hasnt happened yet i dono"
2021-06-15 05:55:44,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, like they did with the apple car."
2021-06-15 10:18:01,wallstreetbets,No it was 3 am and I was high
2021-06-15 10:23:37,wallstreetbets,"Probably not I was high, was not expecting such a debate to occur"
2021-06-15 13:01:03,wallstreetbets,No China bad
2021-06-15 10:21:19,wallstreetbets,"Ur joking right, over the last two years they have given over 100 countries trillions in loans to build their infrastructure.  Allowing them to build military bases in these country’s expanding their power, that being said they don’t want this smoke"
2021-06-15 06:29:39,wallstreetbets,"They’ve thrown away their regional power. They still very much have their soft power. With countless African countries owing large debts to China and numerous countries backing both the AIIB and China’s Belt and Road Initiative, China is growing pretty rapidly on the world stage, especially considering the lack of enthusiasm surrounding the American, Japanese, and Australian alternative, the Blue Dot Network. Hell, in a decade or so they might reclaim Vladivostok and eventually make their way up to the Arctic."
2021-06-15 05:59:21,wallstreetbets,Uh because this isnt SimCity and you click a button and factories spring up instantly..  Also the political situation is forever unstable in Mexico say what you will about Communists but they know how to keep people in line
2021-06-15 07:57:04,wallstreetbets,"America used to do this, when NAFTA rolled out. 

China is significantly cheaper."
2021-06-15 10:21:02,wallstreetbets,"Sold, opened a short position on Walmart.

I think apple can mitigate china pressure with my indian bois"
2021-06-15 07:43:05,wallstreetbets,"Having 10 of the 15 poorest countries in Africa owing you money doesn't actually help them right now - China got to aggressive off the back of those plays. It's not just the west against them, the world is cancelling China and they will have to play along because despite their talk the country is incredibly vulnerable economically."
2021-06-15 06:10:36,wallstreetbets,"I deleted other reply cause it was a scattered response.

Mexico may not have the factories china has. But id much rather invest in an up and coming mexico to build new factories and bolster their economy before we keep sending money to china just for them to steal technology and aim their nukes at us.

Shipping from mexico would be cheaper. It would be cleaner. It would be faster. It would shore up a neighbor and therefor secure our borders and potentially help with the drug issues here due to people not having to seek that kind of work out of desperation.

Mexico gets their fentanyl and their precursors of meth in bulk from china.....which im sure china is willing to turn a blind eye to that.

China trade needs to stop. It may have worked at one point in time..it is no longer in American interest."
2021-06-15 07:18:56,wallstreetbets,"While I won’t argue about the instability of Mexico, it is likely that we could find someone other than China do our manufacturing. China mainly does our manufacturing because a number of key factors, cheap labor, status quo, and rare earth materials, and stability. Companies love all of the above things and when one of them start to falter they will try and find better options. The huge issue with China right now is the labor costs, workers actually get paid better now and the middle class had grown by a huge margin. This means it costs more for grunt labor as the scarcity of low class jobs become an issue. This is such an issue China has been working on subsidizing all of their labor needs by outsourcing to African countries for even cheaper labor. Secondly is the status quo, companies themselves largely don’t want to disrupt each other but conflict with the US and China has tension higher than ever. Which can be seen has a potential threat to the status quo. China is leading the world in production of rare earth materials and is a huge reason why we have been reliant on them but we’ve done a lot of research in finding new ways to gather our rare earth materials. Stability sort of ties into the status quo but more talks about the stability of the producing government and is the most likely reason as to why the US isn’t investing in Mexico while we don’t mind investing in China."
2021-06-15 08:04:24,wallstreetbets,"I mean, its a lot more in depth that what your initial comment would suggest. Right now, over 40% of contractors in Africa are Chinese, compared to just 7% being American. Africa is home to half of the world’s Carbonatites, which is the primary source of rare earths. It’s also home to more Cobalt and Coltan than any other continent, which is essential for electronics. Let’s not forget that China already provides ~85% of the worlds rare earths. The US not only does not have the reserves that China does, but with Greenland seemingly against any large scale production and mining of such materials (evident in their recent referendum), the US now has only one place to turn to, Africa. It’s hard to mine such materials when China already has a foothold in places like the DRC, which is home to half of the worlds Cobalt on its own. China didn’t go in there to get those countries to pay them back, they knew they would default and they knew what they’d have left to give. Right now China is the most important ally to a continent with an impending industrial revolution, whether we, or Africa for that matter, like it or not, and that’s dangerous for the current Pax Americana."
2021-06-15 06:33:23,wallstreetbets,Still thinking you are in Sim City.
2021-06-15 06:49:45,wallstreetbets,"People are going to seek out that work regardless of which.  Its all geography we love drugs in the US especially cocaine which since we've pretty much shut off the direct route from Columbia to Florida with DEA, Coast guard and Navy intervention and patrolling it shifted to the place that borders us.  The Mexican narcotic industry was really just alot of weed and some heroin coming out of there till the 80s when they became the cocaine mules for the Columbians and got a deal instead of being paid cash for moving it they took product instead.  So they stepped all over it raised their profit margin and started making obscene amounts of money which allowed them to buy off politicians to look the other way and the military to help transport it.  Thats how you end up with things like Los Zetas.  All the while the drugs keep flowing because there is a market for it.

So the only real solution to Mexico that doesn't end in a drug war worse than what theyve had over the last 20 years is curbing the US market.  

There's also the reticence to do business with a country that has for a national holiday the nationalization of the oil and mineral industries.

And with China we dug our own grave since the 80s with them.  We looked at it as a billion person market we could bend to western ideals.  So we gave a ton of concessions to China to allow them to open it up on the hope that they'd become capitalist and free.  Instead what they did was used that newfound economic prosperity as the entire foundation of the CCP to enact whatever agenda they want and the Chinese people are all for it.  If you go from 1989 the last time there were large scale protests against the CCP to now there's not much in between.  Half of it is the authoritarian nature of the government the other half is much like the third Reich the people know their government is up to shady shit but look the other way because if things are immeasurably better economically than they were a decade ago why rock the boat."
2021-06-15 08:59:15,wallstreetbets,How do you deal with cartels tho? Unless they’re included in some way?
2021-06-15 08:05:10,wallstreetbets,"Yeah we primarily focus on China to manufacture more high tech goods nowadays than 20 years ago.  The problem is what we dont rely on them for has been switched to their communist neighbor to the south Vietnam.  The problem with outsourcing our manufacturing to emerging markets is political stability.  We've tried to exploit other countries long before China was even a large trade partner.  You go back to Mexico and the Diaz regime we practically owned the country then he got booted out a civil war started and they decided to nationalize every major industry.  Hell Haiti used to be a huge exporter of clothing and sports goods in the 70s and 80s until that all went to shit. I think we looked as it as well the American people dont have an appetite for what Smedley Butler wrote about in War is just a racket anymore. So we just shifted our production to countries that were stable problem was we created this monster in China.

Geopolitically being codependent with China is a great idea since it lessens the chance of another Cold War scenario where the world splits into halves basically.  But we are also allowing a country that has a population that far exceeds ours and ran by an authoritarian government the ability to do whatever they like because what are we going to do cut ties and tank our economy?  I dont know what the rational answer to it is because we arent going to affect regime change in China and they arent going to alter their behavior.  The real out of the box idea would be to establish some sort of EU like Zone for the entire Americas but that runs contrary to everything we believe in as Americans and will just get lumped into some NAFTA like bogus argument."
2021-06-15 07:55:49,wallstreetbets,"It was looking like India was going to be the pick for replacing China for manufacturing, but with Modhi, I think no one is going to bother"
2021-06-15 08:29:45,wallstreetbets,"Of course if China does want to play trade war for real the US will take a significant hit but it will be irreversibly worse for China. It's not just the US and China duking it out anymore. Global sentiment has fully turned on Beijing, no one wants to be in business with China anymore. There's plenty of mining being conducted in canada, australia and scandy - China is not holding all the export cards, they have no choice but to compromise on trade unless they are willing to tank their own economy for a decade."
2021-06-15 07:04:34,wallstreetbets,I have been working Hermosillo Mexico and they are build new factories as fast as they can it seems. From the contractors we use down there they tell us they are swamped. Lots money to be made in Mexico right now
2021-06-15 06:36:48,wallstreetbets,Better start learnin mandarin then china boy. That way of thinkin definitely wont ever solve the problem.
2021-06-15 07:05:04,wallstreetbets,"I agree with just about everything you mentioned. But i know drugs. I know mexicans. The majority of them here illegally are honest people just wanting to make money to send home to their family. 

There will always be illicit markets. However. Giving someone the opportunity at decent wages..theyll be less likely to go the route of trafficking. 

There could also be incentives given to crack down on these cartels if given the shot at American business which i can assure you is worth WAYYYY more than any drug market combined. 

Politicians are politicians because they either want power or change. Or both. America investing in their infrastructure would give these politicians both.

If someone came up to you and pointed a gun at your head and said well make a billion dollars together...then the next day someone came up to you and put a gun in your hand and give you 10 good men and said well make a trillion dollars together...

Who do you think would win?"
2021-06-15 08:37:54,wallstreetbets,"I agree with everything you’ve said, I’m not arguing against the implications and consequences of a trade war, we all know the US “wins” that 10 out of 10 times. All I’m saying is that for some parts of the world, it’s already too late to turn back from the Chinese economic sphere, mainly countries in Central Asia and Africa. We all know they suck, even those countries know they suck, but they’re legally bound and what they have left to give is resources of major importance, especially since rare earths are used to make things like solar panels, electric car batteries, wind turbines, magnets, and weapons. Even if it was aggressive, China has a head start and a monopoly on a lot of these we wish we had. Yeah no one wants to do business with the Chinese, but unless we decouple our economies further, we’ll have to."
2021-06-15 07:53:06,wallstreetbets,Are you in any plays on the potential mexi-boom?
2021-06-15 06:45:09,wallstreetbets,"LOL! Way to go dude. Of course when someone tells you what reality looks like (despite your dreams) it has to be a “China boy”.

I’m sorry to be the one telling you that you need mora than 20 years of investing in Mexico before they can produce half of what your country is currently buying from China. And by the time you get there you’ll probably have a socialist nut being president of Mexico (almost there now...but can always be worst like you are seeing further south) and there you go with your drama again.

As I said... I’m sorry reality sucks. You are as much China’s bitch as China is your bitch. Deal with it and realize all of this is just political theater to keep people like you happy."
2021-06-15 07:19:12,wallstreetbets,"Sure but on the same hand how many drug dealers are there in the US?  Yeah if say their economy was anywhere on par with ours I dont think it solves the drug problem.  Its just too lucrative of a industry.  And yeah the overwhelming majority of them here are to work in legal industries.  I don't like the narrative that if we solved illegal immigration we'd solve the drug problem.  We've tried blaming other people and countries for our drug problems for far too long.  It all starts and stops with American demand solve that then we won't have this cesspool of shit from South America to the US border.

And as for your point about how other industries would be more lucrative.  You know how much the cartels make a year in just transporting to the US?  Over 500 billion.  You arent going to find the volume or margins on any legit industry compared to narcotics.  That industry is just a shade smaller than our entire grocery industry in the US.  Its not going anywhere with that kind of money being thrown around."
2021-06-15 15:07:25,wallstreetbets,It depends....am I Chuck Norris?  If I'm Chuck Norris I don't even *need* a gun.
2021-06-15 08:45:32,wallstreetbets,Yeah I don't think we're disagreeing - what I'm trying to say is I think the chance of China making a meaningful move against the US economy in the current climate is very unlikely. They've been over playing their hand for a while and it's catching up with them.
2021-06-15 06:56:29,wallstreetbets,"Not really. You act as though i implied it would be overnight. Obviously thats not realistic. But we could start by bringing back our medicine and more critical things. It wouldnt take as long as youd think. Construction dont take that long. Mexicans are hard workers. 

You put the boot on the neck of these massive companies doin business in china...theyll get those factories built.

Lol America chinas bitch..thats funny."
2021-06-15 08:53:16,wallstreetbets,"Oh yeah, absolutely. Seeing the QUADS legit come together last year for the first time in history, the G7/NATO standing in solidarity against China’s rise, and the multitude of affected countries speaking out against China’s claim to the Spratley Islands really makes me think the rest of the world is finally coming to understand China’s fake benevolence. Maybe that’s why Jinping said the other day that he’d like to change China’s malevolent image."

2021-06-15 13:30:16,wallstreetbets,Wait for a pullback on spy like when it recently sold down to 405.  Buy atm/itm leaps.  Sell OTM calls against the leaps.  Profit.  Continue to do this and with less than 10% of your portfolio fuck around with memes and shit.  If those hit buy more spy.  Love u. 😘😘
2021-06-15 06:29:09,wallstreetbets,Fuck me 😂........🤡🔫

2021-06-15 18:24:21,wallstreetbets,Dude you’re gonna recover just fine.  I was down to $3k in my gambling portfolio two weeks ago and now it’s back over $10k.  I know it sucks but it just takes one good play.

- $BB market cap is a small fraction of others in the space like $PLTR, $SNOW, $CRWD.
- Add in the ape rocket fuel and you get..

So when the 'meme sector' or 'short sector' decides to get a pump other tickers with salience will rise. Last week you pretty much could have bought a call on any of WSB's darlings and made money.

For highest shorted stocks there's a bunch of websites, everyone has their own preference. If you forget you can always google and it'll show up. I typically use highshortinterest [link](https://www.highshortinterest.com/) but it's always good to check others and cross reference, not everyone measures it the same way e.g. short% of float is different from short% shares outstanding."

Only 3% shares still available to be shorted:
(https://nakedshortreport.com/company/VXRT). 

Today it held bullish support staying above 8.50 and closing at 8.80. If this holds through close tomorrow and Wednesday expect 🌈🐻 to start 💩💩💩💩💩. Also expect they’ll short that other 3% tomorrow hoping to scare paperhands, but with only 3% they can’t make much of a dent if 🦍 be 🦍. 

🦍 get stock to hold at 10, even the 🌈🐻 who shorted at the peak will be OTM, and desperately trying to get those shares back, and fast. 

Not financial advise, but pretty excited to see what happens when they try to cover 36 million shares. Already have 200 calls. Tomorrow I’m adding stock.

2021-06-15 07:11:03,wallstreetbets,Shorted shares aren't 'due' on any specific date. shorters can remain short as long as they're happy to keep paying interest on their shares (currently around 6.5% P.A for VXRT).

2021-06-15 09:28:51,wallstreetbets,"Think of shorts as the opposite of buying shares. To go short you literally borrow shares (hence the interest payments) to sell, in the hope of buying them back ('covering') at a lower price.  


The other side of you calls is just selling calls. You can probably do this too via your broker app (gotta beware of that infinite risk though). Check out r/thetagang or r/options if you want to learn about selling."
2021-06-15 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$CLF is active on the NYSE Short Sale Restriction list. [NYSE Arca Short Sale Restriction list](https://www.nyse.com/markets/nyse-arca/notices)

Thoughts? Do we think CLF gets a nice bump tomorrow? Seemed heavily oversold today as the steel sector is getting good news constantly and Powell seems unlikely to taper off  quantitative easing this month. Seems too early in my opinion. Inflation seems to only be getting started here.

As a highly vertically integrated business, CLF produces significant levels of their feedstock needs in-house, which insulates the company from exposure to pricing risks, especially in the past few months where we have observed historically high steel prices driven by strong global demands. The company’s decision to construct the HBI plant in Toledo from back in 2016, which was opposed by many, has now worked to their advantage. HBI is a critical feedstock for the company’s electric arc furnaces (“EAFs”) used for steelmaking, and the ability to produce the feedstock in-house has effectively eliminated CLF’s need to buy prime scrap, the prices of which have nearly doubled from where they were just a year ago. With more than 97% of their revenues generated from the steelmaking business, cost savings achieved from their vertically integrated business model combined with the ongoing climb in steel prices and global demands makes CLF well-positioned for a profitable year.

Meanwhile from China..

Due to its current policy stance, China's supply is expected to fall short of meeting the rising demand. The country's output is expected to grow at most by 1% in 2021, which is a far cry from the forecast growth in global steel demands of 5.8%."

2021-06-15 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"How to Fuck the FOMO demon  It seems like there are a ton of new options traders here so I thought I would offer up a simple strategy on how to take some profit and fuck the FOMO demon in the ass.

On high IV spikes like this one where the options chain goes insane on a big pump, you can do an after the pump debt spread and lock in some profit while giving yourself a large potential upside.

This is how it works -

So I bought some Woof today, 7/16 $30C

I paid $.60 each (bought 10 - $600)

At close these were $3.83 ($3,830)

The 7/16 $35C at close were $2.85 ($2,850)

So in order to lock in a \~450% gain I would sell to open the 7/16 $35C totaling $2,850.

Here's the hella sick part. There is still $5.00 per contract upside potential on this play and I've already taken $2,850 (\~450%) in profit so a maximum profit of $7,850 with a guaranteed $2,850.

So for all of you that have a serious FOMO demon this will help you lock in some profit and still not miss out when you have a play that takes off to tha mooooooon.

I'll answer questions if this doesn't seem clear so feel free to ask. We are all retards at some point."
2021-06-15 01:08:52,wallstreetbets,"Basically...Buy an even amount and split it down the middle to lock investment + profit

(For the smooth brains lol)"
2021-06-15 03:20:43,wallstreetbets,Was hoping for a pic of a FOMO demon getting railed. False advertising
2021-06-15 01:48:06,wallstreetbets,Ghetto spread
2021-06-15 01:37:26,wallstreetbets,"Instructions unclear.. started fucking my boss in the ass for fear of missed objectives.

Who profits here, tho??"
2021-06-15 01:09:51,wallstreetbets,"So you bought a call, and sold a call as well? My brain is trying to make its first wrinkle"
2021-06-15 01:58:58,wallstreetbets,WeBull doesn't let you do this yet. But Poor Man's covered calls are a great strategy.
2021-06-15 01:16:32,wallstreetbets,"question...

where would the difference from 3.83-2.85 go? 

that’s almost a $100 per contract your missing out on?

edit: also, i’ve thought about doing this in the past and never thought it would work so i’m curious as to how this works."
2021-06-15 01:48:50,wallstreetbets,Ghetto spread. Cult
2021-06-15 02:04:38,wallstreetbets,So basically spread after you’ve already cummed so you can cum again.
2021-06-15 01:06:17,wallstreetbets,Spread ‘em
2021-06-15 03:26:46,wallstreetbets,Good strategy thx for sharing
2021-06-15 04:08:54,wallstreetbets,"Is this like turning an open call into a call debit spread? If so, does Robinhood recognize it as a spread once I sell the short call? Otherwise in order to close, would I have to sell my long call, and then buy back my short call, or does it happen simultaneously?"
2021-06-15 05:00:06,wallstreetbets,"You are missing the most important point, you need your initial calls to actually make money….

That’s the hard bit!!"
2021-06-15 01:57:52,wallstreetbets,"My question is, does your broker app allow you to sell naked call? I assume you still hold that 7/16 $30C without any shares? I know there is one spread called ""call debit spread"" but yours is different from that"
2021-06-15 01:12:26,wallstreetbets,OK but you need a margin account for that.
2021-06-15 04:21:18,wallstreetbets,"If your sell call is in the money, you can still get assigned so you very much have to pay attention to if you don't have the spare cash (and exercise the bought call). Watch selling calls over ex-dividend dates."
2021-06-15 08:32:47,wallstreetbets,"Jerking your pp once per day keeps the doctor away.

Seriously dude, you gotta purge that nut."
2021-06-15 02:34:19,wallstreetbets,What is profit?
2021-06-15 09:18:54,wallstreetbets,"Unclear, I have an odd amount of calls, do I hold until they are worthless"
2021-06-15 01:12:33,wallstreetbets,Have you tried putting it in the washer for an hour?
2021-06-15 01:13:51,wallstreetbets,"Yes, bought a call and it skyrocketed. Instead of taking the 3.83 per call I sold a further otm call for the same exp (wrote an options contract) for 2.85 and gave myself the spread between the 2 (5.00) as the potential profit if it goes to $35 or higher."
2021-06-15 02:25:17,wallstreetbets,Does Robinhood? 😂
2021-06-15 01:19:20,wallstreetbets,"yes

In exchange for the $500 per contract potential upside.

This works well on things like what has been happening on wsb lately 

It rockets and if you have time till exp you can lock some in while letting it run cuz who the fuck knows where these are going."
2021-06-15 05:14:05,wallstreetbets,"Last time I did this in robinhood I had to close the short leg first, couldn’t close them simultaneously as a spread"
2021-06-15 02:38:32,wallstreetbets,This is not selling naked. The lower strike price call you own $30c secures the higher strike price call you sell $35c as if it were shares.
2021-06-15 01:23:16,wallstreetbets,"Debit spreads involve buying in-the-money options and selling out-of-the-money options. In this case, the right to exercise the long option at a more favorable strike price offsets the obligation to sell at the less favorable strike price, which means that no margin is required.

&#x200B;

probably varies from broker to broker but you effectively selling a covered call"
2021-06-15 11:19:56,wallstreetbets,"Absolutely!

They moon at 3:58PM on date of expiry 🙃"
2021-06-15 01:13:10,wallstreetbets,"No, will that help tho?"
2021-06-15 02:26:21,wallstreetbets,Know if TDA lets you do naked calls?
2021-06-15 02:55:56,wallstreetbets,"Yes, but you shouldn't use Robinhood. Etrade is good. If you like to buy on margin IB has the lowest rates."
2021-06-15 01:23:51,wallstreetbets,"I see, this is definitely them something to consider.

Say for example i have AMC 6/18 $40 @ 3.50 

Tomorrow i sell the $60 call for ~$6.00 

Would i then collect $20.00 worth of premium if AMC closes above $60 on friday?"
2021-06-15 05:15:29,wallstreetbets,Ahh tyty.
2021-06-15 02:42:56,wallstreetbets,"Sry my brain is not working right now, so let’s say if stock price goes higher than $35+$2.85(premium you sold), and the buyer decides to exercise $35C, how would your app do?"
2021-06-15 01:27:52,wallstreetbets,Fair enough...tbf my broker sucks so I'm not surprised they don't let me do shit like this...
2021-06-15 01:17:20,wallstreetbets,Just make sure you leave it in there for a week.
2021-06-15 02:36:36,wallstreetbets,"Idk, this strategy is the same as a covered call as your lower strike price call secures the higher strike price call you are selling."
2021-06-15 09:41:32,wallstreetbets,I have the same problem with TD. They don't consider my long leg for covering a sold call.
2021-06-15 02:57:40,wallstreetbets,"Been gradually moving out of Robinhood. Now have money split pretty even between it, Webull and TDA. What’s IB stand for?"
2021-06-15 01:50:38,wallstreetbets,Your max profit would be $66-$43.5 = $22.5 in that case
2021-06-15 01:25:22,wallstreetbets,[removed]
2021-06-15 02:55:09,wallstreetbets,In order for someone to exercise this they would have to eat whatever premium is left on that option (dumbfuck or close to exdiv dates) very rare but it could happen so yes it is a risk to be aware of for more on how this works google assignment risk on a call debit spread
2021-06-15 01:29:19,wallstreetbets,"open up that robinhood dawg, I heard they let you do box spreads."
2021-06-15 02:47:20,wallstreetbets,"It should be, right? But when I’ve tried it they don’t seem to consider them covered unless I exercise."
2021-06-15 05:11:51,wallstreetbets,"So, basically a call debit spread?"
2021-06-15 03:34:43,wallstreetbets,Interactive Brokers. The interface sucks but they got the lowest margin rates in town.
2021-06-15 01:25:36,wallstreetbets,you can close these early as well
2021-06-15 03:09:56,wallstreetbets,"Sounds better than selling put, imma try it out on my SNDL call, my brain was fucked last week during AMC dip FML"
2021-06-15 02:54:06,wallstreetbets,"I don't know I rarely use TD, maybe check the options level you are approved for?"
2021-06-15 03:22:06,wallstreetbets,It just not look to see if you have another position unless you buy and sell in the same trade so it recognizes it as a spread
2021-06-15 02:55:21,wallstreetbets,Thanks! And thanks for sharing. Great post and strategy!
2021-06-15 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"SOFI- summary of article today, saying Cup & Handle indicating a strong break out.. The author (excerpt below) is basically saying that a move above $23.75 in the next day or two (which completes the handle) ...would send Price much higher...

... (which lines up perfectly with what the
end of the order book has been showing all
week.. $23.50 is now basically the breaking
point for shorts...at which time the bulk of shorts will begin to cover quick and hard)... and after the 21M shares shorted the past two weeks, the total is around 45M shares.


**Article Quote/ Excerpt**
(Chart posted on SOFI Stock Twits page.. could get image to post here)
It’s a classic in the world of growth stock investing. It’s called a corrective cup with handle base and it’s working on its finishing touches in SOFI stock. And for bullish investors that want a breakout play with the odds stacked in their favor, SOFI deserves a spot the short list of buys of this kind.


Technically and as the illustrated chart reveals, SoFi’s smaller handle consolidation has just entered its third week of construction. Development is occurring within the right side of the larger base and finding support off the 50% retracement level. At the same time, pattern resistance has formed at the 76% Fibonacci level.
Altogether, the construction of SOFI’s cup with handle is visually attractive for a nearby breakout and pending buy decision in SOFI stock if shares proceed to clear the high of handle.


Less characteristically of the cup-with-handle base, the handle’s depth of nearly 25% is wide by textbook standards of around 10%. More importantly , overall pattern volatility of both the cup and handle are observably congruent. And in this strategist’s estimation, that’s the overriding factor in setting up SOFI as a strong-looking cup with handle breakout candidate.


the author basically saying that above $23.75 in the next day or two (which completes the handle) ...would send Price much higher

... (which lines up perfectly with what the
end of the order book has been showing all
week.. $23.50 is basically their breaking
point... when the bulk of shorts will now begin to cover quick and hard)... which, after the 21M shares shorted the past two weeks, totals 45M shares."
2021-06-15 03:03:48,wallstreetbets,"SoFi, the product is amazing. Galileo, owned by SoFi, is the AWS of banking. It's highly undervalued at this price. It will be an easy 40$ stock by the end of this year, which is still undervalued. SoFi should be valued close to 100 billion, same as Square in 5 years. Square has a headstart, but over time they all should be same.

2021-06-15 14:29:07,wallstreetbets,Your brokerage reports your gains or loses to IRS otherwise people would launder money through them.
2021-06-15 16:19:53,wallstreetbets,"Real talk!! When this goes big and you make over 200k pull that shit out, Go buy a home (all cash), ( do this before December 31 2021), and do a cash out refi for max amount (20% less than fair maket price) and pay your taxes with the money you pull out of your new home. My fellow apes might ask why, it because when you buy a home cash you now own a home worth $$$ and when you borrow against the home, the banks give you more money! Now you have you home$$ plus bank money$$. At the end of the day that home will get paid off and you made more off of it... this is how the rich stay rich."
2021-06-15 16:07:28,wallstreetbets,Nah man there is still half the year left to offset those gains.
2021-06-15 13:26:58,wallstreetbets,"I'd recommend paying them as soon as you cash out. 40% to be safe. You'll be tempted to spend it, and you don't want to be in debt to the IRS. Also, if you overpay you'll get a nice fat tax refund at the end of the year."
2021-06-15 15:44:40,wallstreetbets,"You're an idiot if you pay taxes on Options gains. Gov does not track derivatives, only wants you to think they do."

2021-06-15 15:52:46,wallstreetbets,"That’s definitely a bad way of using your money.  

Why wouldn’t you reinvest the whole lot back into stocks say 60% ETF and 40% stocks you like?  In Oct/Nov.  reasses your stocks and if there are any losses sell it to save capital gains taxes.  In theory you are investing at 65-75% of a dollar since you are saving in taxes from washing it with capital gains.  If we are winning all around great, wecan sell some for taxes feb/march or try to hold for a year. To avoid capital gains"

But if you have, for example, $15,000 in losses in 2021, and then $16,000 of investment gains in 2022, can you write off all $15,000? Or only $3,000?"
2021-06-15 17:33:10,wallstreetbets,So what if you hold the investment for over a year but capitol gains are over 90k? Is that considered long term since it is over 1 year?

Those of us who have been working for a living are used to this tax rate, it's what we pay on our normal 9-5 working income.  That you believe it's a ""bend over tax table"" rate just shows how out of touch with reality you are.  This is just what everyone should be paying in taxes, or are already paying in taxes if they're not tax evaders."
2021-06-15 17:38:26,wallstreetbets,I have a question ... what determines if your realized successful trades are taxed as capital gains or income tax ?
2021-06-15 18:28:01,wallstreetbets,Wait I thought Biden increased it to 30% for all

2021-06-15 18:22:46,wallstreetbets,"I am sorry your assumption is dead wrong. I never said heloc, I said cash out refinance (theres a difference). A heloc is mainly used when you still have a remaining balance, meaning you still have a mortgage. Some people refer to this as a second mortgage. NOW, when you own your home free and clear. Meaning you used you AMC money (200-300k) to buy a home. Now you have a asset that is appreciating and the banks love that, they want you to borrow against you home. Let me be clear APE when you owe nothing on a home you dont have to heloc in fact I wouldn't heloc. I would cash out refinance your home for a fixed rate 3% and the banks will give you (160-240K) per the range above that you can use to pay for capital gains (48-72K). In your scenario you will not be able to buy the same home because you gave the GOV the money now so your home buying power will be (152-228K homes). fact check me about the refinancing https://www.bankofamerica.com/mortgage/refinance/"

When the stock is at $50 at the call date his profit would be (($50-$20)x300)-$164 = $8836.

He probably sold around $57.5."
2021-06-15 17:51:36,wallstreetbets,"It's unfortunate that you got downvoted for asking a question.  
Effectively, by making a bet so far out on time, and really OTM (Out The Money. Meaning, for the Call, the Strike Price was well above the share price) he was able to pick up the calls for really cheap. (Also, at the time, AMC wasn't really volatile. More volatility in the stock makes for more expensive Option Contracts. So, ideally, you want to go long on a contract in low volatility, and sell them in high volatility.)
Now, there's two values at play here. The intrinsic value, which is the difference between the strike price and the current price (for a 20$ call, the intrinsic value currently, at 58$ stock price would be $38-P*100 (P = Premium paid), or 3800-(P*100).
The other value is the extrinsic value, which is the value of the contract itself. This fluctuates depending on variables called The Greeks. These tell you how much the contract shifts based on various events. You have the Delta, which will tell you have the contract price shifts for each dollar that the stock price move. You have Theta, which tells you how much the value depreciates over time (Theta is lower, the further out the play is). You have Vega, which is how volatility effects it... So on and so forth.  

Options are higher risk, but higher reward asset class. You can make a lot. You can lose a lot. Do a lot more research before playing with them. I suggest Ziptrader on YouTube. Happy fishing friend!"

2021-06-15 17:18:24,wallstreetbets,"Using your example...

ONLY Realized Gains are taxable. If you buy a stock at $10 and it goes up to $110, but you don't  sell it, you don't owe taxes until you sell it. 

Outside tax deferred accounts, for each trade where you Realize a gain:

* Cost Basis: $10 (what you paid) 
* Net Sales Price: $110  (Practically speaking, most brokers report Net Sale = Gross Sale - Expenses. Expenses are things like Commission.)
* Taxable Gain = Net Sale - Cost Basis = $110 - $10 = $100

Now, say you have some shares you bought that lost money when you sold them. You bought 10 shares at $11 each, and they cratered to $1 each.   


* Cost Basis: $110
* Net Sales Price: $10
* Loss:  Net Sales - Cost Basis = $10 - $110 = -$100  


Now, when you prepare your taxes, Losses offset Gains (Short Term separate from Long Term):

* Gains - Losses  = $100 - $100 = $0

Hope that helps."
2021-06-15 17:10:47,wallstreetbets,Just that $10. And if it's short term it gets included with your normal income.
2021-06-15 17:11:56,wallstreetbets,"In the US, yes, it's only your gains. The 100 you put in should've already been taxed since you likely worked for it in some capacity, even if it is capital gains itself. 

You should always know the appropriate gains tax applicable to your gains and keep your break point in mind. It's always better to have to pay the gains tax than it is to write off realized losses."

At the end of each year, your broker sends you a 1099-B (typically a 1099-B Consolidated). It will list all your transactions. And there will be a total at the end. If you're not mired in Wash Sales, you can usually just enter the bottom line (for short and long term) without fiddling with individual transactions.

The rub here is that your broker sends a copy of your 1099-B Consolidated to the IRS, and if you ""forget"" a transaction, you will be getting a Nastygram from the IRS. If it's ""a mistake"" you'll have to ability to correct it, but you may pay fines and interest on any taxes you owe. If the IRS thinks you are evading taxes, life may get a lot less pleasant...

End of the day when all the transactions settle, what is different?  On paper I suppose you could “afford” a more expensive place because you’d have a larger down payment, but I assume all the same ratios apply whether it’s a 1st or a cash out later so it’s all relative.  Unless you don’t have the income to support the payment - then the cash out never happens and you lose the house I guess. 

Basically you still end up with a house, a mortgage, and a tax bill right?  I’m dense and still missing something here.  It’s like driving in a straight line vs. taking 4 lefts."

So if you earn 20k in your day job, you'll just pay what the regular tax of 20% (if you're Self Employed) or 30% on PAYE, on those wages, but if you've earned 10k on  the stock market then you won't pay tax on that as its not combined with your wages and doesn't exceed the limit for CG.

2021-06-15 17:51:10,wallstreetbets,"A Roth IRA is just a tax favored investment account. You make contributions with post-tax income, and pay no taxes on withdrawal. Any gains realized in the account are not taxed as they are realized (edit: removed contradictory statement). 

Yes, once you put money into Roth IRA, you have to actually invest the money.

Most Brokers have Money Market Sweep, where if your money is not invested, it will pay (a pittance) of interest, which stays in the account. 

To make gains, you have to invest."
2021-06-15 17:39:14,wallstreetbets,"It's slightly more complicated than that. 

HSA Contributions are typically made through an employer with pre-tax funds. However, anyone may contribute to your HSA within restrictions as defined by law. You may also make post-withholding Contributions and those come off your taxable income (meaning the effect is the same).

Short Term Gains are taxed at the same rate as Ordinary income (if you have an overall gain), becoming part of your Adjusted Gross Income. Long Term Gains are also reported as part of your AGI, but they are taxed at a different rate (rather than as Ordinary Income). 

The HSA Contribution is an Adjustment to Income, so offsets capital gains as well as income like interest and dividends, pensions and wages. 

Once your contributions are in an HSA, they grow tax free and remain tax free on withdrawal as long as they are used for medical expenses (as described in the HSA rules). However, medical expenses that you pay with HSA funds cannot be claimed as Itemized Deductions on Schedule A."

* Higher now: Traditional IRA (Contributions with pre-tax income, taxed on withdrawal)"
2021-06-15 17:44:25,wallstreetbets,"You're right about that.

Most Americans do not have a 401K. However, every American can open an IRA at their local credit union (or brokerage).

Most employers will do a payroll deduction for making deposits to an IRA, but if they won't, you can always do an automatic transfer from your bank account. 

To do any of those things, you must have earned income (usually wages)."

2021-06-15 15:21:59,wallstreetbets,"The wash sale rule is actually a 60 day window, 30 days previous, 30 days after. (I know semantics but it does very much matter) So if you bought GME, sold it at a loss, saw it begin to rise and then repurchased and then sold it again. Instead of saying “well I had 3k in loses then 12k in gains, only 9k of gains is reported to the IRS” you have to pay the full gains on the 12k if it was within the wash sale window. Which would apply to this sub often IMO."

Let's say you buy, and sell for 100 loss, then rebuy immediately. Your 100 loss is deferred and the deferral is attached to that buy. If you sell that rebuy at 200 gain, you hold nothing now, the wash sale reverses and the loss is realized, so you'd have 100 of taxable gain, net."

2021-06-15 17:54:02,wallstreetbets,"Is it within the wash sale period or the taxable year?  E.g. it was designed to prevent liquidations in December and rebuys in Jan.  Thereby creating a loss in one taxable year and creating a much lower tax basis in the following year.   I was of the impression if you buy and sell every day for 6 months (for example) and hypothetically liquidate in October… wash sale won’t be much of a concern for tax purposes.  Now, if you have a deferred tax basis that carries over tax years, theoretically you could have a loss in real dollars AND still pay taxes on the trade because the “loss” carries over in terms of tax basis to the following year?"
2021-06-15 18:19:08,wallstreetbets,"So if there is a sell, buy, sell. It’s not a wash (as in the buy that initially gave you the stock was way before the first sell, and outside the wash period)? Or a sell, buy?"
2021-06-15 18:16:30,wallstreetbets,"Right, actively trading the same stock and having some gains/losses flipping around generally isn't a big issue - you'll get taxed based where your positions sit at year-end, then carries over deferred tax basis into next year. Keep in mind period is still the driving force - any rebuys you make in January will trigger a December wash sale loss deferral since the sell is the tax event."
2021-06-15 18:28:33,wallstreetbets,"I slightly misspoke. There have to be two buys minimum, but the first buy can be at any time, and the second buy has to be within 61 day window. So you could buy, hold for 2 years, sell, rebuy 5 days later, and that's a long-term capital loss deferral. Alternatively, and weird to conceptualize, but if you buy, hold for 2 years, buy another lot, then sell the 1st lot 10 days later, that's also a wash sale."
2021-06-15 18:34:45,wallstreetbets,"Ok, that’s what I thought! So how does it become a capital loss deferral? Does it have to again be sold within the wash window to realize the capital losses? As I understand the first one would be a textbook wash sale as you sold at a loss and then after the sale you rebought the same security making any loss that you would have realized null. And yes I did know about that weirdness, even though the IRS loves FIFO it makes it a wash sale still.

Edit: I think I understand your capital loss deferral now that I thought it through. If you bought GME at $100, and then sold for $50, buy then rebought it again at $60, the IRS just puts your cost basis for your stock at $100 again because you bought within the wash window. So therefore if GME hits $150, you only realize $50 in profit and not $90. But if that’s how it works if you bought a lot of GME at $100 and sold it at $50, and then bought a half-lot of GME, the losses of the half you didn’t buy back cannot be realized because of the wash sale rule but for the half you did buy back still maintains a cost basis of $100. Am I correct in thinking this way? Sorry for so many questions, I love learning about all of this and the company I work with doesn’t do tax-loss harvesting, so I won’t be learning about this much!"

2021-06-15 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Let's Talk About Corsair With Some Comparable Growth Stocks Alright, CRSR had a day. Full disclosure, I am balls deep in contracts and shares (46 Dec 17 40C and ~1300 shares to be specific).

I am going to compare CRSR to ENPH, AMZN, and CRWD. I chose these stocks because I own AMZN and CRWD and am in the solar industry, so I have followed ENPH as well. They are all tech growth stocks. AMZN sells products on the internet and has software subsidiaries. ENPH sells relatively high margin products. CRWD is a growth stock in its infancy. I believe they make for reasonably good comparisons to CRSR because they all have similar revenue growth over the past few years (well, CRWD is slightly higher) and all are part of growing industries.

What happened recently? Well, they crushed their Q4 and Q1 earnings. Shares were at about $46 before Q1 and the February sell off hit them hard. Then they bamboozled Q1 and went up for a day, then dropped down to $31-32. It popped a but and Eagle Tree sold 5 million shares at 32 bucks. It appears that ended last Friday. So basically, they had 2 blowout quarters and their share price tanked by just under 50%. Absurd. Volume was usually under 2 million. Today it was over 65 million. That likely means retail bought a huge chunk of shares formerly owned by insiders and institutions.

Here are the numbers (they might be slightly off, I am rounding and sometimes make mistakes):

Compound Annual Revenue Growth rate:

CRWD – Last 2.25 years: 41%

AMZN – Last 4.25 years: 30.5%

ENPH – Last 4.25 years: 26.3%

CRSR – Last 4.25 Years: 31.8%

CrowdStrike is a relatively new company. The others are established. CRWD has the best gross profit margin of the 4, and CRSR is the lowest. Here are the TTM gross profit numbers:

CRWD – 73.9%

AMZN – 40.5%

ENPH – 44.6%

CRSR – 30.6%

So CRSR loses a bit here. This is more than made up by the following PE Ratios. I am going to use the average of the past 2 quarters of company reported earnings for this. 

CRWD – 506.5

AMZN – 55.1

ENPH – 69

CRSR – 16.2

Alright, so this is a bit crazy. I understand that there is a premium on margins, but that should show up in the earnings. Solar industry growth is flattening, ecommerce is growing, but at a much slower pace than before, cybersecurity gets a bump for likely being the fastest growing. And then there is gaming, a continuously growing industry quickly being adopted by the younger generation and played by everyone who is not a boomer. Gamers are getting older, and richer. They are getting real jobs. They spend a good chunk of their disposable income on their girlfriends… NOT!

This is absolutely insane. CRSR had a higher growth rate than ENPH, albeit with worse margins, and their past 2 quarters beat ENPH on an EPS basis. ENPH’s share price is 147. CRSR is 36. WHAT???

CRWD had 999 Mil of revenue in the past 12 months. Their market cap is 52.7 billion. CRSR’s is 3.32 billion on 1.9 billion of sales.

WMT, just to throw a name out there, had 3.5% CARG over the past 4 years and their PE ratio is *explicit*23. What is going on here?

The answer is boomers think video gamers are going to stop playing because the pandemic is over. 

I don’t know, man. Their Q1 was great, beat bigly on revenue, margin, and earnings. They said they were supply constrained, I believe it. I think that gamers are going to continue to buy their PCs and memory as fast as they can stock it for the rest of the year. They guided 18% revenue growth for the year and blew out their guidance in Q1. During their earnings call, they said something like it “even beat their internal projections” which means they think they are going to beat their own guidance. 

OK, so what is my point here? Well basically it is that they are growing quickly and already profitable, which is a rare combination and generally earns a PE ratio well north of 35. If their PE ratio was 35 (based on annualizing their most recent quarter) their share price would be $81.2. 

“Wait Sirenor, isn’t that PE ratio way lower than the other stonks you showed?”

Yes, it is. To the moon gents. 


TLDR – Buy CRSR, it is very cheap."

2021-06-15 03:38:15,wallstreetbets,"I’ve played CRSR at least five times. This last one I held Thursday - Monday and it ran $32 - $37 when I jumped out. Definitely out too early but I buy large batches and try not to get greedy and hold too long. 

Based on its 6 month history, I’d expect yet another dip to 31-32, but it’s looking like it might just be going on a nice run up. Good luck to everyone still in."
2021-06-15 04:18:37,wallstreetbets,"Gross margin means a lot.  It's a sign of how much pricing power, how differentiable, how much value-added their products have.

I'm not a gamer, but I buy good value electronics at decent prices.  Corsair is a good, not-great brand, like Anker.  

So...  Don't know if it's priced too highly or too poorly, I do know there are better places for my finite amount of money."

You guys sent me a $200 motherboard that didn’t work and cost me $150 taking it to a PC repair shop to figure out what is wrong. Maybe let the fucking cables to (which may have not even come with the faulty
motherboard anyway)"

2021-06-15 12:50:25,wallstreetbets,I don’t understand the “calls” part of the stock market at all? Can someone dumb it down for me in a reply?

2021-06-15 01:04:47,wallstreetbets,Can someone teach me how to do calls. I’ve got no clue what the fuck is going on
2021-06-14 23:40:05,wallstreetbets,Sir may I introduce you to my wife? I encourage you to cum inside. Would you be so kind to let me watch?
2021-06-15 02:32:03,wallstreetbets,Diamond hands!
2021-06-15 07:32:31,wallstreetbets,"I'm really sorry to inform you but by the way you're holding it, eventually, you will return this cash to the market."
2021-06-15 12:56:27,wallstreetbets,"I just got ready and closed most of my options out !  Made around $40,000 profit straight beck into AMC shares!  Nothing as great as yours but great minds think alike!  This took me Diamond balls to do as well because I have held for over 5+ months now ;). Not easy to do especially when some days I was down over $5,000+ but now that we popped we had explosive growth!  Way to go my friend if you have some that are very low strike price look into exercising if it’s worth it to you!"
2021-06-15 00:06:49,wallstreetbets,"Congrats man!


On a side note: I'm trying to learn more about options.


Could you help me understand why you're holding on to these as calls? Wouldn't executing them let you have them as shares?"
2021-06-15 00:39:22,wallstreetbets,So sick. Good for you!
2021-06-15 00:55:31,wallstreetbets,Legend!
2021-06-15 04:49:17,wallstreetbets,"I still have my 1500 bucks worth of shares I bought at 56 each. Gonna hold to see if maybe it’ll hit 70/80 a share and then take myself to a nice steak dinner. Not gonna get rich obviously, but that’s an okay small little gain I’m happy with."
2021-06-15 05:28:36,wallstreetbets,"This is the kinda guy who ends up losing money while he’s up 5000% because he didn’t sell.


I know because I’ve been him lol"
2021-06-15 11:34:11,wallstreetbets,"yo, shout out to the people who bought a bunch of AMC stocks and are still holding. I only bought 2 at $15/each and I'm up $80+. I can't imagine holding if I bought more!"
2021-06-15 00:48:11,wallstreetbets,That looks great but i seem to missing key the key to options because i still dont fucking get it.
2021-06-15 01:22:22,wallstreetbets,"Wait till Thursday morning, this is gonna be looking way better. ImO 🤷‍♂️"
2021-06-15 03:02:57,wallstreetbets,"Congratulations, very happy for you. But damm do i feel bad cause i feel like an idiot. Like a true true retard."
2021-06-15 12:35:07,wallstreetbets, It’s just fairy dust until you realize.  Sell now; you are sitting in your moon base already. Don’t get evicted back to your studio apartment on Earth.
2021-06-15 15:01:48,wallstreetbets,"Jesus. This gives me hope. I have nearly 250 SQQQ calls that expire Jan 21st 2022, and Jan 20th 2023. Crossing my fingers ya'll start pulling out of the market faster than your first time fucking the ugly chick you found on AIM Chat without a condom."
2021-06-15 00:39:36,wallstreetbets,"Don't sell, the key is to hold until expiration and exercise."
2021-06-14 23:39:39,wallstreetbets,Nice. When did u get these? What price was AMC at?
2021-06-15 00:35:09,wallstreetbets,AMC OR DIE!

2021-06-15 02:33:33,wallstreetbets,Well done my ape
2021-06-15 02:35:50,wallstreetbets,"Just to be the voice of reason here, we want to live to fight another day. You can roll these out in time at this pricing to recapture some time value and hedge against sudden price changes by giving you time to cost average. I had a bad experience recently 🤫. I’m sure you are way ahead of me, and congratulations on your gains thus far!"
2021-06-15 02:43:08,wallstreetbets,So I'm a total noob on options. Does he have to have the total amount in the bank to exercise these options? Or just the amount he paid up front?
2021-06-15 02:57:55,wallstreetbets,This is the way👍 hold the line guys 🙌💎
2021-06-15 03:31:03,wallstreetbets,Would suck a D for these gains. Gz
2021-06-15 03:33:49,wallstreetbets,Are you gonna exercise those bad boys?
2021-06-15 03:35:17,wallstreetbets,"I might have to buy back. I paperhanded those last week :( :(

Servers me right"
2021-06-15 03:38:02,wallstreetbets,"The market makers are gonna love you!  Someone""s gonna have to go find some shares.  I think we all win when that happens. Not sure how it all works.  Anyone???"
2021-06-15 03:50:07,wallstreetbets,"I think I understand. But can someone explain this to a smooth brain?

You basically lock in x amount of shares at x price? Basically going long expecting the price to go up?"
2021-06-15 04:46:20,wallstreetbets,Anyone know what app OP is using?
2021-06-15 04:53:52,wallstreetbets,"Waiting for realized gains. Only realized gains are worth real money. 

I will come back next week monday"
2021-06-15 04:58:58,wallstreetbets,Got a little stiffie from this.
2021-06-15 05:18:14,wallstreetbets,Damn dude! 💎
2021-06-15 05:18:53,wallstreetbets,"How does this work, he has to buy the shares at the price of the contract or ? What if he doesn't have enough money to buy the shares?"
2021-06-15 05:21:24,wallstreetbets,don't yolo me. (i'm jelaous)
2021-06-15 05:24:06,wallstreetbets,You sir are a fucking neanderthal! Master fucking ape son!
2021-06-15 05:32:59,wallstreetbets,"Alright, fuck it. I'm in for the next dip. Imma run the numbers after the next witching day and see what I can afford"
2021-06-15 05:42:28,wallstreetbets,"Hey, can I have some of your money?"
2021-06-15 05:55:35,wallstreetbets,This guy/gal fucks
2021-06-15 06:00:57,wallstreetbets,I can’t grow diamond hands like this. I’ve missed thousands selling at 100-500% on amc and clov. And many more
2021-06-15 06:06:11,wallstreetbets,"Can someone please explain how calls work? I have never understood them.

Thank you, and well done sir! Good job sticking with your gut!"
2021-06-15 06:07:45,wallstreetbets,Do you have a screenshot of the original transaction for your call options?
2021-06-15 06:14:29,wallstreetbets,"This is great massive congrats on your success.

2021-06-15 07:23:09,wallstreetbets,"If you don’t have the money to buy those shares, what profit do you make when selling the call?"
2021-06-15 07:24:09,wallstreetbets,"Come on fatty, exercise!!"
2021-06-15 07:29:49,wallstreetbets,Exercise or GTFO

2021-06-15 07:33:50,wallstreetbets,"AMC gang, rise up. My January/February homies are used to seeing the red, so they aren’t even phased by these minor dips. Heck, yesterday we saw a 15% raise. I want huge tendies and I’m not selling till I see them. 10k is the floor"
2021-06-15 07:37:41,wallstreetbets,That‘s the way to go 🚀🚀🚀
2021-06-15 07:40:41,wallstreetbets,And here I am on my 5 day losing streak
2021-06-15 07:42:58,wallstreetbets,What’s the next call option I should look into?? 👀 75? 70 strike price at what date
2021-06-15 07:43:48,wallstreetbets,Oh congratulations comrade. What are you going to do next?
2021-06-15 07:45:39,wallstreetbets,Can anyone help me get started in options? I do understand how it works and what it all is. But the numbers on the spreads always get me. I’d like to maybe just make the same trade as someone on here. As long as I think it’s a good trade of coarse. I have 10k and 4 kids. We need a bigger house. Please help me.
2021-06-15 07:45:56,wallstreetbets,"Geeze
I with I know more about options 
Good on you!!!!!🦍🚀🌙"
2021-06-15 07:48:45,wallstreetbets,"Ok, I see these all over this sub, It is very impressive but a serious question. Is this just on paper or can you get this money? I see over 200k is this accessible. This is what I don't understand."
2021-06-15 07:56:03,wallstreetbets,I bet you’ll sell this week. You paper handed coward! Good job sir now you can send you wife and her boyfriend on a trip around the world so you can do more hood rat things with your friends!
2021-06-15 08:00:39,wallstreetbets,Diamond handing calls... This is what WSB is about.
2021-06-15 08:06:07,wallstreetbets,I held 10$ leaps I sold in Jan Bc I’m a turd. 1300$ would have netted me 80k. 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮

2021-06-15 08:14:13,wallstreetbets,"Some of those “haters” might be from the o’l January pump and subsequent no more buying of the shares dump on GME and have some pretty valid reasons for you to sell your positions. That being said, nice job."
2021-06-15 08:16:44,wallstreetbets,Fuuuuck I need to learn how options trading works....
2021-06-15 08:18:31,wallstreetbets,"
Hi all which broker would you recommend for options trading in the UK or Europe?"
2021-06-15 08:22:11,wallstreetbets,"Might be time to take some profits off the table, just in case there's a down day or two before Friday. Just my two cents worth, though!"
2021-06-15 08:22:46,wallstreetbets,"Ape team... please ⬆️ vote 100 SNDL posts this morning and when you message or post, please use “SNDL”. We are losing our number #1 spot but still huge new capital in the stock!  SNDL is coming!  Who’s in! SNDL to the 🌙 rocket 🚀 time!"

2021-06-15 08:39:25,wallstreetbets,"I mean tbf, these were probably worth more during its first run to 70."
2021-06-15 08:44:52,wallstreetbets,"God, massive congrats and fuck you, I can't wait to get a job(I'm unemployed and sick) just so I can actually make money like this, I got +500% on amc from stocks, I only had a single share, but damn options are wilder."
2021-06-15 08:46:46,wallstreetbets,How did those options look when AMC was at $70?
2021-06-15 08:51:09,wallstreetbets,Haters gonna hate. Amc to the moon baby
2021-06-15 08:54:51,wallstreetbets,Allays do the opposite of what “everyone” says.  That was my Fathers only advise to me.

2021-06-15 08:59:24,wallstreetbets,"I'm not in your epic situation (fuck you btw), just a xxx share holder. But I wanted to add that the haters, who more often than not are friends and family, STILL say to sell. They have been wrong every single moment of 2021 on this ACM GME ride. How can people so wrong continue to insist they are right? This adventure has taught me so much about people"
2021-06-15 09:00:48,wallstreetbets,You know the way of the covered calls I see
2021-06-15 09:04:30,wallstreetbets,Repost the loss in 2 weeks please.
2021-06-15 09:05:07,wallstreetbets,I'm guessing you aren't going to exercise these are you?
2021-06-15 09:06:02,wallstreetbets,This is the mfing way. Congrats and fuck u.
2021-06-15 09:08:13,wallstreetbets,Go back on the big win!
2021-06-15 09:09:13,wallstreetbets,Wow
2021-06-15 09:10:15,wallstreetbets,"How the fuck do you do options? I don't understand how you make money on calls or puts.   


It's not the same as simply making an investment & getting money when it gains value. So how are the gains for options so high?"
2021-06-15 09:10:58,wallstreetbets,Awesome.
2021-06-15 09:13:29,wallstreetbets,Bragging before you've crossed the finish line is a bold move. I love it.
2021-06-15 09:17:45,wallstreetbets,I’m still waiting for my “first one is free” lol. One thing I have learned is to just take the gains on the first big push up because more than half the time it never does anything higher before your options expire.
2021-06-15 09:18:52,wallstreetbets,Shares 💎💎💎🦍
2021-06-15 09:18:58,wallstreetbets,"So i was under the impression that for you to be able to sell or “exercise” those options (which i may be getting confused) you had to have the value of the stock at time of sale in your account so if its at 73, you would need 7300. 

My friend was telling me thats incorrect. So i guess im confused"
2021-06-15 09:19:01,wallstreetbets,The people telling you to sell at $70 with IV numbers never seen before and a broken option chain were haters?
2021-06-15 09:22:41,wallstreetbets,🤔thinks about buy  50$call for crazy premium... and 3 days till theta death
2021-06-15 09:22:55,wallstreetbets,Do calls auto execute when the contact expires? Or do you have to physically execute it or else lose everything?
2021-06-15 09:23:01,wallstreetbets,You sick mentally challenged ape fuck
2021-06-15 09:24:44,wallstreetbets,"Wow that’s awesome, good for you, I wish i could do something even remotely close to that"

2021-06-15 10:26:33,wallstreetbets,I’m scared to sell any of my shares to open up cash to even try. I feel like we would all make more money if we rented out a big ass house and lived together. Have pc screens everywhere and just buy calls together all day.
2021-06-15 10:27:25,wallstreetbets,"Ok, NOW sell.

2021-06-15 10:37:50,wallstreetbets,Fuck...I need to learn how to do calls
2021-06-15 10:38:01,wallstreetbets,"I’m not looking for financial advice, but is AMC good for calls right now?"
2021-06-15 10:38:44,wallstreetbets,Take that
2021-06-15 10:38:55,wallstreetbets,Holy shit?! Legendary bruv.
2021-06-15 10:39:07,wallstreetbets,Get ready for DKNG.....Hindenberg primed the short sells ready.

2021-06-15 10:39:51,wallstreetbets,"Good shit bro! Lol, crazy gains, I’m at $32k profits so far. But to get to your level I’m hoping my sept $145s go off the charts!"
2021-06-15 10:40:13,wallstreetbets,Going to be exercising some of those options right??!!
2021-06-15 10:40:14,wallstreetbets,Teach me sensei
2021-06-15 10:43:01,wallstreetbets,I know you hate money and all but you should really sell that.
2021-06-15 10:45:44,wallstreetbets,Nice but Fuck you. Get yourself some real shares ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|poop)
2021-06-15 10:47:19,wallstreetbets,"I have 20k liquidated cash to spend. I'm am not looking for anyone to give me financial advice. Please just share some knowledge .

Question guys, I have only been buying shares. Although familiar with options, I have never used them as an investment tool. I want to know if buying options and converting to shares is more  or just buying shares will create a bigger impact."
2021-06-15 10:52:26,wallstreetbets,For fucks sake look at these green candles!
2021-06-15 10:52:31,wallstreetbets,"Someone teach me this, ill pay you to explain this to me!"
2021-06-15 10:54:25,wallstreetbets,"Theta gang is gonna come at you fast, lol. You should sell your 5000%"
2021-06-15 10:57:30,wallstreetbets,You never go broke taking a profit!
2021-06-15 10:57:51,wallstreetbets,I’m right there with ya. Everyone been telling me to sell. Bought them at 0.42.
2021-06-15 11:00:05,wallstreetbets,"We aren't haters, we're just trying to look out for people. Most situations don't work out this well for people, congrats!"

2021-06-15 11:02:32,wallstreetbets,"I’m glad I sold my Sens Friday call on Monday for the 7$ profit. It started dropping the next day. Don’t be too greedy, I hope you cash your able to cash out, Congrats!!! Wish I started options sooner, to get in on AMC earlier."
2021-06-15 11:02:51,wallstreetbets,I have decided my goal here is to have many people say 'fukk yu' to me.  Some day I hope to post a screenshot of earnings that prompts that type of response.
2021-06-15 11:04:15,wallstreetbets,I wish I understood what this meant and how you did it
2021-06-15 11:04:42,wallstreetbets,This guy fucks for real
2021-06-15 11:05:48,wallstreetbets,I still don’t understand how calls work.
2021-06-15 11:07:35,wallstreetbets,You go girl! I still think you should have cashed out at @ $70 but I guess scared money makes no money.
2021-06-15 11:07:37,wallstreetbets,Trash
2021-06-15 11:08:18,wallstreetbets,Why not sell some and eliminate risk?? That way you don’t need to diamond hand it because the rest of the calls are free
2021-06-15 11:10:31,wallstreetbets,This is aging beautifully 🥲
2021-06-15 11:11:16,wallstreetbets,My brain is very smooth and new to ape army. If anyone can explain calls to me I’d appreciate it
2021-06-15 11:11:40,wallstreetbets,You've got a very nice savings account. LFG!
2021-06-15 11:12:21,wallstreetbets,"Hey look, more money than I've made in the last 5 years."
2021-06-15 11:13:22,wallstreetbets,"""haters"" told him to sell haha"
2021-06-15 11:16:17,wallstreetbets,How do you roll it from one week to the next? Don’t you have to sell it before it expires?
2021-06-15 11:18:14,wallstreetbets,"You give ape hope. Good hope. Much tendies to you, fellow ape.

Edit: ape not good at spell words."
2021-06-15 11:24:33,wallstreetbets,I wish CLNE would do this. It's stagnant. Move you cow farting MFer!.
2021-06-15 11:24:50,wallstreetbets,"Well not to take away from your gainz. But make sure you recoup your initial investment (maybe a little more for your work). That way you covered you ass, and the rest are fun coupons."
2021-06-15 11:29:02,wallstreetbets,Thank you sir. Fuck you.
2021-06-15 11:29:10,wallstreetbets,HOLD THE LINE RETARDS!!!
2021-06-15 11:30:15,wallstreetbets,I've got to get educated so I know what posts like this are actually saying(from the technical prospective).
2021-06-15 11:31:30,wallstreetbets,And here I am just holding 220 shares at 20.59 average. I may not be making FU money but for me it's enough. Congrats and FUCK YOU! Best of luck in the future. Don't get greedy. Once you celebrate the gains maybe step off the gas and see where the chips lay elsewhere after the inflation hubbabalu falls off. Good luck this week fellow ape.
2021-06-15 11:33:38,wallstreetbets,"Can you explain to me how you do this? I understand the buying shares and holding, but what are these calls?"
2021-06-15 11:37:24,wallstreetbets,"Holy gainz Batman!

Gratz and obligatory FUCK YOU."
2021-06-15 11:41:43,wallstreetbets,And I got -14.32 in the bank lol

2021-06-15 12:00:06,wallstreetbets,Soon you’ll have a chair in the board!
2021-06-15 12:01:19,wallstreetbets,I need to learn how about calls. It seems so risky tho but I guess scared money makes no money
2021-06-15 12:02:35,wallstreetbets,As someone who has no idea about these things. How do you decide what to buy and what are you looking for?
2021-06-15 12:08:00,wallstreetbets,Is there any place I can learn options/calls for dummies? Whatever I read just does not stick! Help an ape out peeps...
2021-06-15 12:08:24,wallstreetbets,"Get it ape!

I have much less going on, But I'm also still hodling on to all of my calls expiring this Friday 🤑"
2021-06-15 12:09:10,wallstreetbets,"Well then this ""story"" from FOrbes should make you laugh ... ignore those ""kids""! Buy my ""report"" instead! ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy)

2021-06-15 12:13:39,wallstreetbets,Congrats! And fuck you
2021-06-15 12:14:10,wallstreetbets,"Will you sell or exercise?! I have some expiring July 2 at $14 and new to options, so looking for advice!"
2021-06-15 12:16:48,wallstreetbets,I threw  money in the stock for the calls ♥️
2021-06-15 12:17:36,wallstreetbets,What are you guys best guess for AMC by Friday?
2021-06-15 12:18:53,wallstreetbets,Damn you a G
2021-06-15 12:19:37,wallstreetbets,Bro adopt me…
2021-06-15 12:20:11,wallstreetbets,What am I doing with my life.
2021-06-15 12:23:23,wallstreetbets,When did you buy? Curious how early you had to get in to make these type of gains
2021-06-15 12:24:27,wallstreetbets,At this point I would sell. How much you are going to make if you wait until Friday?
2021-06-15 12:24:48,wallstreetbets,He’s a business man!!
2021-06-15 12:29:18,wallstreetbets,Did you buy these from that girl who was selling naked calls?  You ruined her life.
2021-06-15 12:46:21,wallstreetbets,BS
2021-06-15 13:01:28,wallstreetbets,"Well, you probably should exercise them before close on Friday. Just Sayin’"
2021-06-15 13:16:59,wallstreetbets,I'm scared though at when the bag holding is gonna start .
2021-06-15 13:18:51,wallstreetbets,!RemindMe 3 days
2021-06-15 13:21:25,wallstreetbets,"Asking As a n00b, he's gonna  wanna sell these rather than let them expire right?"
2021-06-15 13:39:32,wallstreetbets,Fucking well done
2021-06-15 13:41:23,wallstreetbets,Sweet gains.
2021-06-15 13:58:41,wallstreetbets,I sold today ….. I sold my sell button
2021-06-15 14:01:28,wallstreetbets,Jesus Christ
2021-06-15 14:09:19,wallstreetbets,"So how does all this work? I'm new to this stuff, so I don't know a lot. From what I see, I'm assuming you buy a stock at a certain price, and the price can go either down or up depending on the companies condition. And then you sell the stock when you feel like it or something? There's a deadline to when the stock expires?"
2021-06-15 14:12:39,wallstreetbets,Mans was prolly up 10k%+ and didn’t sell
2021-06-15 14:21:52,wallstreetbets,sell that shit you idiot

2021-06-15 14:41:02,wallstreetbets,See if I was holding those the price would crash to $.01 Friday at 9:29am. Haha good on you man.
2021-06-15 14:45:17,wallstreetbets,I want this money
2021-06-15 14:46:17,wallstreetbets,If you don't sell soon you are going to lose all your gains ... Or you need enough cash in your account to fulfill the exercise of all the options.
2021-06-15 15:02:46,wallstreetbets,me happy with just my 7 shares :)
2021-06-15 15:14:50,wallstreetbets,When we're they bought

2021-06-15 15:58:29,wallstreetbets,Enjoy those capital gains taxes!  🤣
2021-06-15 16:00:27,wallstreetbets,Wow very impressive
2021-06-15 16:05:14,wallstreetbets,"I was selling covered calls, I've had 1000 shares called away at 15 strike over the past month. Turned 12k into 15k but I still feel like I cheated myself out of a big win."
2021-06-15 16:10:02,wallstreetbets,We’re these long term contracts or short terms was it ITM or OTM when purchased thanks
2021-06-15 16:16:06,wallstreetbets,Don't calls lose a lot of value close to expiration though?
2021-06-15 16:33:29,wallstreetbets,I don't get how calls work. Can some ape explain it like in a retarded crayon eater? Why are they now valuable than owning the stock
2021-06-15 16:57:18,wallstreetbets,WELCOME TO THE WORLD OF WALWAL
2021-06-15 16:57:46,wallstreetbets,Holy shit. Congrats and obligatory fuck you. May we all be so lucky someday!!
2021-06-15 17:09:21,wallstreetbets,I can’t even afford to buy the 145’s for this Friday I’m so damn poor. I eat pasta without sauce on the daily and on a side note my wife is in the other room right now getting dicked down by 3 black boyfriends.
2021-06-15 17:28:53,wallstreetbets,What target AMC?
2021-06-15 18:48:35,wallstreetbets,"You sr are a f........ god , spare some change 😏"
2021-06-15 19:11:05,wallstreetbets,Bet you wish you’d have sold yesterday...
2021-06-15 19:57:22,wallstreetbets,"I’ve never seen green. Alright, I’m following you now so lead me to the promise land on your next bet 🚀"

2021-06-15 00:00:04,wallstreetbets,"I’d be selling before Friday. Cha-Ching!
Where lambo?"
2021-06-15 02:55:27,wallstreetbets,Fake news.  Even if this worked for you 99 percent will get screwed. You are no better than Wall Street.
2021-06-15 00:56:33,wallstreetbets,"AMC June 15th thoughts on the lowest price so I can buy 20 shares. Not asking financial advice, just a good guess. 🦍"

2021-06-15 12:00:24,wallstreetbets,Is there a place to find information on what call options are and the best ways to make these types of calls? I’m really new to this.
2021-06-15 01:50:05,wallstreetbets,Real talk: think I can still make some AMC tendies?
2021-06-15 02:36:54,wallstreetbets,I gotta figure out how to do these calls.
2021-06-15 03:34:28,wallstreetbets,"Literally can't go tits up

Edit: even if it does free tits"
2021-06-15 03:52:06,wallstreetbets,Amc to the moon is my opinion

2021-06-15 05:13:02,wallstreetbets,Jesus cristo good work my guy.
2021-06-15 05:14:06,wallstreetbets,"I mean once you cross your break even point there’s no advantage to holding them over shares. In order to help the cause, you should exercise them - the question is: will you?"
2021-06-15 05:16:22,wallstreetbets,"If we can get everyone on wallstreerbets to unite & chip in by buying a few shares, we break $62 resistance & quickly get to the $70-80 range. Let's do it!"
2021-06-15 05:45:45,wallstreetbets,Now hear me out….take a quarter of your profits and buy puts for two months out
2021-06-15 07:07:06,wallstreetbets,So now exercise them to help out the cause
2021-06-15 07:07:56,wallstreetbets,It is a play. Run share down buy pref. Save company run share up.
2021-06-15 07:10:15,wallstreetbets,Fuck me dude. How the hell.
2021-06-15 07:14:28,wallstreetbets,Is there an actual strategy with calls.  Or is it buy and pray?  I get the basic concept but just wondering if there is a correct way to buy?  Like ITM vs OTM when and why kind of thing
2021-06-15 07:14:29,wallstreetbets,Seeell goddamnit!! Take your well earned profits :)
2021-06-15 07:15:56,wallstreetbets,Throw gains at bb?

2021-06-15 07:19:19,wallstreetbets,Hero monke right here
2021-06-15 07:44:41,wallstreetbets,"How do you people do this? 
I buy stock and it goes up like 6%, and here i see shit like wins of 5000000000% (and to be fair losses of 5000000000% too).

You basically just buy 100 shares to do ""calls and puts"" ? I still don't understand those."
2021-06-15 07:51:28,wallstreetbets,You think you have made money but you have not. You make money when you sell above the price you bought.
2021-06-15 08:28:03,wallstreetbets,Is it a good time to invest in it? Where can I buy AMC stocks?
2021-06-15 11:15:05,wallstreetbets,"Hello guys,

how would I buy a put on AMC? My brokers don't appear to be offering any options on AMC, where do I need to go (I'm EU)?"
2021-06-15 11:53:41,wallstreetbets,"Same, my $740 turned into $20k. Still holding! 💎🙌🏻"
2021-06-15 12:04:39,wallstreetbets,My AMC puts are not being kind to me 😂

2021-06-15 13:17:02,wallstreetbets,Proud of you.
2021-06-15 02:20:35,wallstreetbets,Don’t be too bummed out. Most people are paper rich. Stay in the game long enough and it’ll eventually be donated back.
2021-06-15 09:03:14,wallstreetbets,Actually they turned 2100 into 116K on calls
2021-06-15 06:18:13,wallstreetbets,You can do almost the same if u put 1k on a number for roulette in a casino.
2021-06-15 06:25:25,wallstreetbets,Don't be bummed out. This is a casino.
2021-06-15 06:27:30,wallstreetbets,My sons $15 buy turned into $250!
2021-06-15 09:19:26,wallstreetbets,tell me about it. every option i buy goes to 0 lmao
2021-06-15 04:50:43,wallstreetbets,Ikr. How does this even happen? Op Teach me your ways.
2021-06-15 07:11:01,wallstreetbets,What the fuxk am I doing with my life indeed man... I feel like a real piece of trash. Why can’t I do something like that ? Fuck.
2021-06-15 09:24:10,wallstreetbets,Options are the way to either lose all your money or make all your money. If CLNE moons over $20 I'll be taking in upwards of $20k - $40k on a $2000 investment. If it shits.... well there goes $2000
2021-06-15 09:41:34,wallstreetbets,"Also don’t forget it’s not really 34, the tax man-baby is comin to claw that $34k apart."
2021-06-15 10:01:33,wallstreetbets,Someone turned $500 -> $1M with Tesla leaps
2021-06-15 10:45:12,wallstreetbets,Don't let FOMO make you blow your savings. This shit is risky.
2021-06-15 08:21:14,wallstreetbets,$700?  Am I doing my math wrong?
2021-06-15 07:15:08,wallstreetbets,He's full of shit. That did Not happen
2021-06-15 07:10:19,wallstreetbets,i have like 50 AMC of $20 exp 5/27 then after a week goes up. Im not that lucky like others.
2021-06-15 07:19:40,wallstreetbets,Fucking it up just right!
2021-06-15 07:56:57,wallstreetbets,God damnit I bought BB calls for this Friday. I'd hate to think what my $10k would have turned into.
2021-06-15 09:24:17,wallstreetbets,Buying Starbucks and avocado toast
2021-06-15 10:02:42,wallstreetbets,Waiting on 15% ?  I feel the same way
2021-06-15 10:07:23,wallstreetbets,"I missed out on those almost exact numbers on $WEN last week. Read great DD on it the day before was going to buy some just barely OTM calls before the market closed and didn't get to it.

$WEN spiked huge after-hours and premarket. I got in with 750 first thing in the morning and made a 40% gain but if I had bought in the day before would have been 5,000 to 6,000 percent depending on when I sold the calls."
2021-06-15 10:34:39,wallstreetbets,My $500 Call is now worth $5800k it expires in January.
2021-06-15 11:20:26,wallstreetbets,700 where??!
2021-06-15 11:35:56,wallstreetbets,I turned 700 to 46k last week. Could've sold at 59k the week before that..

2021-06-15 10:28:21,wallstreetbets,Yeah... Options don't really get better lol. I hope he looks at a calculator and sees what has to happen to get more improvement from this because they are more likely to degrade than improve from here on out. I don't think many of these people know how they work.

2021-06-15 01:44:02,wallstreetbets,"Oh, you buy them."
2021-06-15 02:14:08,wallstreetbets,"A call is a contract that gives you the right but not a obligation to buy 100 shares of a stock at a agreed upon price. This is an example, let’s say there is a house for sale for the price of $100,000 and right next to it there is a plot of land that is about to be constructed on. You go to the seller of the house and say “I’ll give you $5000 for the option to buy this house at the price of $100,000 no matter if the value of the house goes up or down 3 months from now.” The owner agrees and you now have a call contract for $100,000 in 3 months. Now let’s say the plot of land next to the house that you wanted to buy turned out to be built into a mansion and brings the house you want to buy property value up to $500,000. Since you have that contract, you still get to buy it for $100,000 instead of having to pay $500,000. Now let’s say in another example that the plot of land next to the house you wanted to buy is turned into a sewage dump and brings the house you wanted to buy value down to $2. Even though you paid for the contract you are not obligated to buy the house and can just let the contract expire and lose the $5000 you paid for the contract and walk away."
2021-06-15 04:21:47,wallstreetbets,Congratulations. You’re the only honest AMC holder in this thread
2021-06-15 09:58:14,wallstreetbets,Go look up a dude called ‘in the money’. He’s got a whole section and really good explanations. I still rewatch trying to make it all stick.

2021-06-15 00:29:56,wallstreetbets,"Yes - if s/he/ape were to exercise, the call options become shares and the premium paid to buy the options will be wasted.
This is why the vast majority of options are never exercised/assigned."
2021-06-15 14:11:15,wallstreetbets,Paperhand much?

2021-06-15 03:38:35,wallstreetbets,It’s tough not too on those big gain days
2021-06-15 07:57:24,wallstreetbets,"The way I understand it is if OP decides to excercise those options, they have to have the money on hand to buy all of those shares at whatever price the options contract stated which should be much lower than the market price. Then OP can sell those shares to bank the profit. So yea, in a play like this they need to have a ton of money to excercise.

However, if OP does not have the money to excercise, then they can sell the option to someone who does have the money to excercise, and this will of course come at a fee. So if OP sells the option, they make some profit, but not as much as they would if they excercise the option. 

The risk here is, what if there isn’t a buyer? What if no one wants to buy OP’s options? It will expire worthless and OP lost all the money.

I just recently started playing with options so I’m not an expert. Would like to know"
2021-06-15 10:09:47,wallstreetbets,"That if it doesn’t hit the strike prices by Friday, his calls will be worthless. Typically people sell their calls to someone else and keep the profits you see in green on the right."

I went to a casino once with $500 and turned it into 10k. That was a decade ago. I will never gamble again because I know that I would ""donate it back"", as you said. By avoiding gambling for life I can die with a $9500 gain on the house."

2021-06-15 08:59:06,wallstreetbets,quit gambling and invest
2021-06-15 10:06:29,wallstreetbets,Charge it to the game has more of a meaning.
2021-06-15 11:07:06,wallstreetbets,Real advice
2021-06-15 13:09:38,wallstreetbets,That's why you always cash out some and use it for other hard assets like real estate.
2021-06-15 13:26:46,wallstreetbets,"Considering you use the profit or some portion of it to reinvest and not touch any initial capital, it's possible to continue the streak but I get what you're saying."
2021-06-15 13:44:21,wallstreetbets,Motto of this subreddit
2021-06-15 13:52:09,wallstreetbets,Fastest way to lose is to sell longest way to lose is to hold. Some where in the middle is a win if you can time it right.
2021-06-15 17:22:50,wallstreetbets,Or do what I do and lose it by paying down debt. It’s like a continuing cycle of making sure corporate investors get their money back.
2021-06-15 17:27:14,wallstreetbets,Amen. I got 4000 shares left from the original 13000. Avg 7.38. I sold more than half at 74 AH. I don’t plan on giving a lot back. Unless amc decides to blast thru $100 this week. They can have my 2000 shares at $100. That is where my covered call sits
2021-06-15 19:17:33,wallstreetbets,Can someone please tell me what stocks to buy that are expected to be booming
2021-06-15 08:33:04,wallstreetbets,"Keyword almost.  Casino has lower EV even in fairly priced options.

Some traders all they do is hard DD positive and negative tail distributions that are underpriced.  Small frequent losses for rarer big payout.  They're ""crisis hunters""."
2021-06-15 08:47:26,wallstreetbets,That's a 36-1 payout making it 3X more risky
2021-06-15 08:50:13,wallstreetbets,I turned two 7 dollar Wendy's calls into 530 bucks each lol. I only wish I bought more...
2021-06-15 09:01:17,wallstreetbets,"For every one of these massive gain stories, there's 2-3 loss porn posts to go along with it...you don't make 10000% gains without taking on an insane amount of risk.   Most of these plays lose money.  Every now and then people hit big."
2021-06-15 11:00:35,wallstreetbets,There's two ways to reliably make money. Sell your labor or make things and sell those. Everything else is gambling.

2021-06-15 04:49:58,wallstreetbets,😂😂
2021-06-15 06:21:01,wallstreetbets,Diamonding this one is the wise decision.
2021-06-15 01:22:28,wallstreetbets,"400,000 options are in play and various prices. The best bit is, each price gain brings into play the next level, causing a buy to cover rise, taking it to the next level and so on as market makers cover. Take a look at the chain. As long as we all keep buying, snuffling up the short shares, along with holding and pushing more options - this thing will explode! Not financial advice of course 😝"
2021-06-15 01:47:31,wallstreetbets,Yup. Great fucking channel.
2021-06-15 07:12:46,wallstreetbets,I’m a little disappointed I wasn’t rick-rolled.
2021-06-15 01:52:01,wallstreetbets,"I tried watching videos. I’m just not going to get it. I’ll eventually get it, but for now it’s but and hold for me. It’s all I can do. I see ppl making calls for 145. Don’t that mean I have to buy it for 145. I am determined to learn. I just can’t do it over night. 🦍 💪"
2021-06-15 03:35:26,wallstreetbets,"Goes up a little, make a little, goes up a lot make alot"
2021-06-15 04:33:28,wallstreetbets,"I’ll use calls as an example 
If you spend 10 dollars to buy a call for PLTR at 30 dollars you are reserving the right to buy 100 shares of the stock at a future date (the expiration of the call). If the stock does not reach 30 dollars your call will be worthless, if the stock reaches 30.10 dollars you will have broken even (the .10 over your strike represent 100 shares X .1 dollar), and gains beyond that point will be roughly 100X the gain of the share price. This is at expiration. 

Calls that are out of the money (below the strike price) will generally decay (become less valuable) unless there has been positive movement (it was 24 now it’s 25 therefore it’s more likely to hit 30 by expiration) you can sell calls before they expire if there is positive movement you want to cash in on. 

This was very very oversimplified but I hope it helps"
2021-06-15 04:43:08,wallstreetbets,Yup me too I feel the same way!
2021-06-15 06:19:02,wallstreetbets,Is there a problem
2021-06-15 00:31:02,wallstreetbets,"Hell no. I want the shares and exercised them at $12. 
1000 shares times $12= $12,000

Those 1000 shares right now are worth $57,000-$12,000. $45,000

Much better than selling the contracts, plus I’m helping the cause and this MF gonna moon."
2021-06-15 02:43:32,wallstreetbets,"its totally consensual bro, we recorded her saying “please [don’t] stop”"

2021-06-15 05:15:28,wallstreetbets,Not really. I understand that I have 495% in gains total... but I really just play around and don't invest big money in it. Mostly bc I still don't understand.
2021-06-15 12:55:28,wallstreetbets,No. Sell them all and use the cash to buy however many shares you want.
2021-06-15 02:37:11,wallstreetbets,You sir are smart.  Thank you for the knowledge and feedback to this chain.

2021-06-15 03:05:12,wallstreetbets,This might be the best explanation i have heard. Not that i understand options to begin with but this is simple for an ape like me.
2021-06-15 03:33:08,wallstreetbets,Don't forget you can also sell your contract to someone else.... Either for a profit or for a loss.
2021-06-15 12:15:30,wallstreetbets,Fantastic explanation
2021-06-15 03:07:20,wallstreetbets,"Not OP

This is great and all and I understand the concept. Have spent several hours watching videos.The problem is I don’t know how to input that information on TD Ameritrade. I just want to follow what’s the most popular call people are doing. Can you view that?"
2021-06-15 02:17:38,wallstreetbets,So you are going to just end up selling the options? If so why? Won’t you make more money having the shares over having the options?
2021-06-15 00:54:23,wallstreetbets,Ah got it! Thank you! :)
2021-06-15 02:40:58,wallstreetbets,This upsets me.
2021-06-15 02:29:39,wallstreetbets,You have 5000% + confirmed I need to learn options 😂
2021-06-15 03:43:00,wallstreetbets,You got that right. Now I got the FOMO going big time.
2021-06-15 08:08:10,wallstreetbets,thanks this helps
2021-06-15 11:30:10,wallstreetbets,No doubt
2021-06-15 11:29:22,wallstreetbets,Says who? I've got 5x 6/18 60-70 debit call spreads lol. Would love to see it clip 70 again this week. I don't see it going much over that and if I woke up tomorrow and it was $35 I wouldn't be surprised either.
2021-06-15 12:06:09,wallstreetbets,Thanks man I appreciate it.
2021-06-15 12:49:50,wallstreetbets,"That's exactly why I haven't done it. I'm going to have to take a day to try to figure it out. However, if you know what you're doing then options seem like the way to go to make money"
2021-06-15 12:58:45,wallstreetbets,I hope it happens. I was trading AMC a few months back and I am mad for selling lol! I am not selling this time! Thanks for the reply.
2021-06-15 12:56:43,wallstreetbets,We starting a landscaping business?
2021-06-15 13:20:30,wallstreetbets,Lol. I managed to take home 4.5k this quarter.
2021-06-15 16:24:51,wallstreetbets,Probably would yours not?
2021-06-15 16:08:51,wallstreetbets,I don't think you understand what expiration means...  Willful ignorance is a hell of a drug.
2021-06-15 16:52:18,wallstreetbets,Yep! Hopefully get to your level one day! Still too new to all of this so I'm having fun making money here and there!
2021-06-15 16:39:20,wallstreetbets,"Oh, didn't know it was 100 shares. That explains it. Thanks

Is it always 100 or did you set that number?"
2021-06-15 00:06:15,wallstreetbets,Let me know how that plays out for ya
2021-06-15 01:07:39,wallstreetbets,Lots of buying needs to be done by Friday.
2021-06-15 13:59:52,wallstreetbets,"ok fine, I'll buy a call :D

&#x200B;

yet I still can't"
2021-06-15 09:11:57,wallstreetbets,How much did you stand to lose? Weren't the premiums really high?
2021-06-15 07:53:37,wallstreetbets,How do you get in early on these?   Like which posts do you advise I follow? I fancy a gamble.! 🦧

2021-06-15 08:18:05,wallstreetbets,This happens to many people it’s just that most don’t talk about their losses and bad plays but everyone talks about their big wins. For this reason I appreciate you mentioning this so thank you.
2021-06-15 07:34:36,wallstreetbets,Short term calls are the riskiest bet you can make (except naked shorting meme stocks)

Then the price can go up and down without loosing anything if you not sell or the companies go out of business"

2021-06-15 12:00:08,wallstreetbets,"Okay, serious question. After making the 87k, why not take out your original investment and play around with 81k?"
2021-06-15 07:25:34,wallstreetbets,why not just buy for term...(no options) and hold it together with the Apes 🚀🚀
2021-06-15 07:46:27,wallstreetbets,I’m sorry bro
2021-06-15 08:11:46,wallstreetbets,"See. I just got in on the AMC wave after GME went wild. Bought stocks. I dont understand how the whole call things works. And I dont want to because of this exactly lol. 

If I dont know HOW to fuck myself... i remain unfucked..... right? lol"

2021-06-15 16:42:38,wallstreetbets,"How do you not get out with 87k!! My god, I’m up 2k and I’ve contemplated getting out. Lol"
2021-06-15 16:54:21,wallstreetbets,"Options are a zero sum trade (aside from the premium paid).  Pretty much impossible to win consistently on risky trades.

Kind of like going into a casino with $6k and walking out with $1.5 million by betting it all on black 8 times in a row.  Chance is low but not inconceivable, about 1/319.

With risky option trades you start thinking you are somehow smarter than everyone, so most people end up losing it as the long term average kicks in.

I haven't read any stories on here where someone turned a few G's into millions, cashed in, quit their job, and is now living in Belize with money earned from blue chip dividends."
2021-06-15 18:28:02,wallstreetbets,It is if you treat it like it is. Get.your come up and cash out on less risky stratagies
2021-06-15 06:39:22,wallstreetbets,Calls are risky. Buying shares in January is a no brainor up1000% gains. It’s not a casino if you know how to invest. GME too. Calls can be risky. What are the gains since Jan ? Google it 💎
2021-06-15 08:50:18,wallstreetbets,"I have gone from 1k to 20k during the Jan 28 madness 
Then back to 400 then up to 30k when GME spiked again 
Then back to 0
Put in 3k and got back to 15k with amc 
Now I’m back down to 6k for now…"
2021-06-15 10:08:31,wallstreetbets,That's why you don't touch calls. More people lose than win. Buy real stocks mate; it doesn't have to be a casino.
2021-06-15 07:26:41,wallstreetbets,Change your perspective. You turned 1k into 15k! Nice!
2021-06-15 08:51:33,wallstreetbets,"Did the same thing with BB calls last week, bought right before it popped to like $16, was sitting on almost $6k profit on $1.5k investment, stupidly held hoping it would shoot even higher due to meme power, sold yesterday for a $500 profit and I ended up losing money on the higher strike options so I basically broke even. Never again will I look at 300% profits and not take them."
2021-06-15 09:10:24,wallstreetbets,How much did you stand to lose though? What was the premium on those?
2021-06-15 11:14:58,wallstreetbets,"I told my wife to buy CLOV, then I told her to sell when it peaked and she was up 1,300. Now she’s kicking herself. Next time I’ll have her boyfriend tell her to sell at the peak"

2021-06-15 08:59:49,wallstreetbets,Yeah but what if you turned 9500 into 100k?

2021-06-15 09:49:01,wallstreetbets,"Lol. Same boat.  I bought AMC at $13 months ago.  Two shares.  Told myself that this was a decent one to keep adding to, and never did.  I really wish I hadn’t been a lazy retard and put more money on the table for this one."

2021-06-15 03:51:16,wallstreetbets,"OK it's really pretty easy. Imagine you want to buy a house that is worth $100,000. You put down a down-payment of 5%, or $5000.

Now let's say a month later you've done the appraisal and all the paperwork is ready and it's time to buy. But during that month something indirectly happened that affected the value of the house. 

Maybe Disney announced they were building a new park nearby and the value of the house doubled.
Maybe the city announced they were building a sewage plant nearby and the value of the house plummeted.

Either way, you've already got an option to buy the house at the $100,000 agreed on a month ago regardless of what the price is today. Notice I said option. You don't actually have to.

In the 1st example where the value went up, you can buy the house for $100,000 even though it's worth $200,000, instantly pocketing $100,000 profit in equity. Maybe Beyonce buys the house across the street and the house you wanted goes up to $5 million *in value*. The *cost* remains the same to you. You still get to buy it for $100,000. In theory the price of the house could skyrocket to any amount and you'd still only have to pay $100,000 since you secured that price when you put down the down payment. The possibilities for profit are endless, the sky is the limit. 

In the 2nd example where the price went down and they're building a sewage plant nearby, you decide you don't want the house anymore. You're not required to buy it, but you forfeit your down payment and lose $5000. No matter how much the value of the house has dropped, you can't possibly lose more than your $5000 down payment. 

So while the possible profits are infinite, the possible losses are capped at your initial down payment. 

Let's use that extreme example; Beyonce moves in next door and the house is worth $5 million now. You decide you just want the cash, you don't even care about the house. You want to pocket the money and you can go buy a different house. You sell the option to buy the house at $100,000 to someone else for say $4.6 Million. Not quite the full $5 million because they still have to buy the house, there's a lot of paperwork, etc. You never even owned the house, all you ever owned was the option to buy the house, but you sold that option to someone else and made a huge profit because you were smart (or lucky) and secured that option when the price was low.

This is almost exactly what call options are, with the most significant difference being that your 'down payment' is not applied to the cost of the stock if you choose to buy it. Instead it's paid like a fee for the privilege of buying the option. Otherwise it's pretty much the same. You buy an option today to lock in the price (called a strike price) to buy the stock next week, next month, or whenever you choose. If you locked in a price lower than the stock is actually worth you can either buy the stock at that lower price, or sell your option and let someone else buy the stock at that strike price. If the stock goes down below the strike price, you don't have the buy the stock, you just lose your deposit. So the profit potential is limitless, but your potential loss is capped at your deposit fee.

So let's look at a call option example using simple numbers.

Today's AMC price is $50. You think it will go up to $100 by next Friday. With a traditional long sale you just buy the stock at today's price and hope it goes up. If it's $100 next Friday you've made $50. If it's $200 you've made $150. If it's $10 you've lost $40. This is how you currently buy stock. The problem is your potential earnings is limited to how many shares you can afford to actually buy, and your potential loss is... well you could lose everything if the business goes bankrupt.

This is the beauty of call options. Options are pretty cheap, and you don't have to actually buy the shares. I can buy an option to buy 100 shares for a deposit fee of anywhere between maybe $1 to $15. Even though I don't have enough money to buy 100 shares, I do have enough money to pay for an option, knowing I have no intention of actually buying the stock. Instead, if the price of the stock moves up above what I guessed it would and what I have the option of paying (the strike price), I can sell the option to someone else who can afford to buy the stock. They're happy to buy it because they're getting the stock at less than market price, and I'm happy to make money selling the option. If my prediction was wrong, I'm not on the hook for buying the shares, I just forfeit my deposit.... times 100. Wait what? Times 100?! Yes but wait it's not as bad as it sounds. 1 option allows you to buy up to 100 shares, however you pay the deposit on each share if you buy the stock, and you forfeit the deposit on each share if you don't. It's not that bad though if you consider you could be buying stock at way below market value. 

So let's look at the example above again. If AMC is $50 today, and I think it will be $100 next Friday. I don't have enough money to buy many shares but I do have enough money to buy an option to buy the stock for $50 per share (the strike price) any time until the end of the day next Friday, that option only costs me a $10 deposit fee. That's all I need to put down today. Now if I'm right, and the price hits $100 next Friday, I could buy up to 100 shares for $50 each plus that $10 deposit on each share for a total of $60 per share. That $10 deposit seems steep times 100 but remember the stock is worth $100 so if I do exercise my option to buy all 100 shares I've made a $40 profit on each one.

$50 strike price +$10 deposit fee X 100 = $6000 cost to buy 100 shares
Value $100 per share X 100 = $10,000
Profit $4,000

Well why not just buy the 100 shares today for $50 each? You could, let's consider that.

$50 X 100 = $5000
Value $100 per share X 100 = $10,000
Profit $5,000

At first glance it seems like it simply makes more sense to just buy the stock and not bother with the call options at all. In this particular case with these particular numbers that would have been the smarter choice. But what if the value didn't go to $100? Let's look at some other scenarios.

First let's simply say you don't have $500 today to buy the 100 shares but you are expecting to have money next Friday. Well you could buy the shares next Friday but by then they're up to $100 each remember? You can only afford 50 shares instead of $100 and you have $0 profit. In this case where you don't have money right now, buying a call option today to lock in the price for next Friday would have been your better choice since you'd have 100 shares and $4000 profit instead of 50 shares and $0 profit.

What if you don't have $5000 to buy in today and you won't have $5000 by next Friday? Well remember you don't actually have to buy the stock. You can sell the option to someone else and let them buy it. You can buy an option today for just $10 and sell it before the end of the day next Friday for a profit as long as the share price hasn't dropped below the strike price + deposit fee. If it goes to $100 you'll be able to sell for somewhere around $2000. You don't get the full $10,000 of course because the guy you sell the option to still has to actually buy the stock himself. But still you can make a ton by selling your option as long as it's still at a profit (in the money). Worst case scenario it drops below the strike price you locked in and you are required to forfeit the deposit times 100 for a total loss of $1000. But that's the maximum you could lose, even if the stock drops to zero you're not required to buy it, you can't lose more than your deposit times 100 shares. While it seems like a big risk, your risk is capped, and the potential profits are ridiculous for very little investment. 

Some other factors to consider are determining the strike price and the expiration, as these both affect your deposit fee.

If the stock is at $50 today and you choose a strike price of $50, the deposit is kind of high ($10 per share) because there's a very good chance you will make a profit.
If the stock is at $50 today and you choose a strike price of $100, the deposit is lower (maybe $6 per share) because it's less likely that the price will go that high and your risk of losing your deposit is higher.
If the stock is at $50 today and you choose a strike price of $150, the deposit is much lower (maybe $3 per share) because it's very likely the price will not hit $150 per share and you will lose your deposit. 

The maximum strike price you can choose is capped at roughly 300% of the current share price.

You can actually choose a strike price *lower* than than today's price, however the deposit is extremely expensive because it's very likely that the price won't drop below the strike price. For example you can actually buy an option to buy AMC shares for 50¢ each! But it costs almost a $60 deposit fee PER SHARE, lol.

If the call option expires and you haven't sold it, your broker will automatically exercise it for you if you have enough buying power in your account. Otherwise it will automatically sell it for you. If the price has dropped below the strike price, the cost of the deposit times 100 will be deducted from your account."

2021-06-15 03:46:20,wallstreetbets,"A 145 call gives you the right to buy 100 shares at 145 if the stock passes the price. You don't need to wait for that though, you can just sell the contract even if the price is at 120 or anything, just before expiration ofcourse."

2021-06-15 02:28:10,wallstreetbets,"You can buy for Call 145, but then before the expiration date, you can sell it with some profit… don’t wait too late if it won’t hit 145 or you will lose it all. Or you can “exercise” it if it gets over 145 then itself will convert to shares (x100 per 1 contract) automatically. Options are fun! I’m 4-month newbie too, but so addicted! GL, APE! :)"
2021-06-15 15:00:20,wallstreetbets,That was useful. I still need to read up on it more but that's a good explanation of WHAT they are and how they are used.
2021-06-15 00:45:27,wallstreetbets,and you can now sell CC’s & make hella premium.
2021-06-15 01:20:05,wallstreetbets,"At close AMC was at $57 and you could have sold $12 calls for $45.35.

So you could have sold the calls for $45,350, and used that plus the $12,000 you used to exercise to buy 1000 shares for $57,000, and had $350 left over.  You still have 1000 shares but you also have an extra $350 cash.

Basically you just gifted whoever was assigned your options $350 out of your pocket.  Citadel thanks you for your donation (ok, we don't know that a MM got assigned, but you get my point)

That $350 was the time value of the options.  Any time you exercise early you throw that time value away.

But, still, nice win."
2021-06-15 11:42:40,wallstreetbets,"You can buy at least the same amount of shares without exercising. 

Selling the contracts covers the difference in cost.

If there's any premium you just forfeited it.

But premiums are pretty low at those strikes and maybe early exercising forces early unplanned buying so enough investors doing this could theoretically help pump the price in the short term."

Call option is the right to buy shares at a certain price.

Otm means out of the money. Meaning the contract when you bought it, is for a price that's higher than current. Ie: share price is 15. You buy a contract with a strike price of 20.

The further otm you get the cheaper contracts are generally. So contracts can get really cheap.

As the share price gets closer to in the money, the value of the contract you bought will go up. So his contract that he bought way out of the money for $700. Eventually rose to a value of 34k."

b) In addition, when it expires, do you have to either exercise or sell based on the price at the end of the day?"

You decide you just want the cash, you don't even care about the house. You want to pocket the money and you can go buy a different house. You sell the option to buy the house at $100,000 to someone else for say $4.6 Million. Not quite the full $5 million because they still have to buy the house, there's a lot of paperwork, etc. You never even owned the house, all you ever owned was the option to buy the house, but you sold that option to someone else and made a huge profit because you were smart (or lucky) and secured that option when the price was low.

Here is the part that I think confuses me. You buy an option to purchase the house (shares), it goes up in value and so you now want to sell this option to someone else for profit. But you never actually own the shares at all? So the only thing you actually own is a contract at a specified price? And to avoid paying the full price of that call contract (whatever the price is x 100) and get some profit because the value rose, you have to turn around and sell it at a new number (minus fees)? Am I understanding this correctly?"

2021-06-15 12:36:04,wallstreetbets,So you are making the profit by selling the call option because the contract has increased in value? So this is basically just saying these are the profits that would be made if the contracts were sold right?

2021-06-15 04:52:23,wallstreetbets,❤️  🦍  you are truly amazing to take the time! Appreciate you 🦍 ❤️
2021-06-15 09:39:53,wallstreetbets,"It's a good long story but it skirts around the most important aspect of options trading: most people don't ever exercise. You buy a contract for X dollars, stock price goes up, then you sell contract back for 10X dollars. No shares ever exchange hands and its much simpler than the 12 page post the guy just wrote."
2021-06-15 07:34:33,wallstreetbets,"a) Yes. You can exercise at any time, but you'll need the money to buy the stock, or you can sell it to someone else who will exercise it.

b) when the option expires it trades at intrinsic value, which is whatever it was valued at market close. If you paid $2 premium for a $10 stock and it closed at $15 you would have made $3 profit on each stock in the call, or $300 total. You would then have the option to sell to close the call for $300 or pay $1000 ($1200 total) to then buy the stock if you think it's going to continue to go up.

Alternatively, if you paid $2 for a $10 stock and it stayed at $10 or even went down, the option would expire worthless and you would lose your entire premium. Technically you could still choose to exercise it, but at that point you're better off just buying the stock on open market for cheaper and you would lose even more value that way.

Anywhere in between and you can still recoup some of your premium based on the intrinsic value of the stock vs your premium, so for example if you paid $2 premium for $10 stock and it goes to $11, you would lose $1 per stock or half your premium.

This is where In The Money (ITM) and Out of The Money (OTM) comes from, if you're in profit then you're ITM, if you're expecting a big jump in stock price you could buy OTM calls for big risk, big reward since they are usually cheaper premiums. There's also what people call leaps which are far OTM calls for far out dates, which can be huge rewards and there's also FDs which are far OTM calls for end of current or next week where people are basically just playing to turn a $.01 premium call into a $.05+ premium call and you can get absurd returns very quickly if you're lucky but in reality you're very likely to just lose your premium."
2021-06-15 09:43:58,wallstreetbets,"In almost every case you would make more money selling the option and then buying stock with the profits than you would exercising early. The time value (theta) remaining on the option makes it worth more.

If you let it expire, most brokerages will exercise it automatically if you have enough cash in your account to do so. If you don't want to exercise, you should never let your option get that close to expiration anyways (you lose your time value the closer to expiration you get)."
2021-06-15 10:42:00,wallstreetbets,"If you need ELI5, then don't worry about it yet. Most brokerage firms require trading experience and good income before you can apply for options trading."
2021-06-15 09:46:15,wallstreetbets,Sounds like you are confusing strike price with the cost of the option (the premium).
2021-06-15 11:08:59,wallstreetbets,I think you missed the fact that you pay a $60 fee per share if you want to buy those shares for 50¢ each.
2021-06-15 11:47:30,wallstreetbets,"Yes that's exactly right.  You don't own the shares, you only own the right to buy the shares at a good price, which you can sell if you don't want to actually buy the shares."

2021-06-15 10:44:43,wallstreetbets,Is the premium the down payment and the strike price is the amount i can close to pay for each share of the stock?
2021-06-15 12:04:22,wallstreetbets,"Thank you. So to move this toward trying understand how to actually read and understand the numbers of a call option, if I'm looking at the current call options on the yahoo finance page on the June 18th expiration and the first option at the top shows under the strike column .50, with a last price of $62.90, bid of 62.25 and ask of 62.70, I assume the .50 is the fee or premium per share (x100) and the ask is what I would be paying per share if I chose to  execute (keep) the call option? I'm a bit unclear on how to apply the various column numbers. And if it says volume is 80, does that mean it is 8000 shares?

Thank you for the explanation. I find it all really fascinating and it fills me with a level of frustration and anger knowing that if I had the OPs knowledge about using options I could have turned the few shares I bought in January into enough to pay off my entire student loan debt ."
2021-06-15 11:35:06,wallstreetbets,"In theory, if a home loses its value (example: flint, Michigan; homes built in a flood plane or near a chemical plant) and is now worth less than what was paid or worth nothing (no one willing to buy) but the debt for property is still high (mortgage needs paying, property tax needs paying, maybe repairs are needed) or increasing, perhaps this is what's the above poster means ? A homeowner could theoretically be on the hook for more than the value of the property in such a situation."
2021-06-15 05:09:07,wallstreetbets,"Thank you for your reply! 

The best way to make atleast an amount of this money was to sell the option not to close to expiration?"

2021-06-15 15:12:17,wallstreetbets,you still have to have the money in your account to buy the stock if your put goes ITM... if you sell a GME put at $200 you gotta come up with $20K somehow
2021-06-15 10:27:29,wallstreetbets,"That's because selling an uncovered call has a similar risk potential as naked shorting since the stock could moon to well above that strike price and risk more money than you have in the account.

Shorting requires that you borrow a share from someone, sell it right away, pay an interest rate and hope it goes down sooner than later, but doesn't have an expiration date like selling a call would. Naked shorting (supposed to be illegal and only really accessible my ultra wealthy market makers and prime brokers) basically means you didn't even bother to borrow a real share and just colluded with someone to pay an interest rate so you could sell some fake shares into the market and hope the company goes bankrupt so you never have to pay back a dime."

2021-06-15 14:12:30,wallstreetbets,to be honest i stopped reading at beyonce
2021-06-15 10:52:58,wallstreetbets,"Yes basically, the premium is what you pay to buy the option and open your position. That money is gone forever but the option contract you now hold has its own value.  The strike price is what you can buy the 100 shares for at expiration if your call option is in the money. You also have the option to sell your contract back at any time up until expiration, which is what most people do. If the stock price is above the strike price you chose then your option is most likely worth more than what you paid for it (unless it's just barely ITM)."
2021-06-15 06:40:18,wallstreetbets,Yeh - the common thinking is to sell at least 2 weeks before expiration to minimise the theta crush
2021-06-15 02:54:53,wallstreetbets,I like big mouths..  it a purdy one or what?
2021-06-15 16:32:22,wallstreetbets,">if you sell a GME put at $200 you gotta come up with $20K somehow

Selling a put is like getting paid to set a limit buy order and then deleting the app."
2021-06-15 11:01:59,wallstreetbets,This entire conversation has demonstrated why I have no business engaging in these transactions.
2021-06-15 10:07:42,wallstreetbets,It is like a drug when you see the numbers just get bigger and bigger
2021-06-15 09:56:41,wallstreetbets,Maybe I should try this instead of throwing money at OTM blackberry options that expire next day
2021-06-15 09:56:46,wallstreetbets,I'm in the green on almost every leap I've ever bought and the ones in the red (damn weed stocks) still have a year and a half until expiration so I'm not stressing. It's much better for your blood pressure.
2021-06-15 10:10:06,wallstreetbets,Unless it's some random stock with really low volume there is always some retard that thinks the price will go higher.  As long as there is a bid/ask spread you will be able to sell. Most of the time it's a computer buying it back from you anyways.
2021-06-15 15:24:48,wallstreetbets,you can sell the options back at any time.
2021-06-15 06:24:01,wallstreetbets,Yw
2021-06-15 10:33:44,wallstreetbets,First time hearing it.. I def need to internalize it
2021-06-15 08:57:23,wallstreetbets,"Naked options yes, but you’d be surprised how many people I’ve tried to explain things like vertical spreads and diagonals and they continue to do research themselves after,  and weeks later they still don’t get it."
2021-06-15 14:39:12,wallstreetbets,Me don’t understand that talk. All I got from that was “naked” and “spread” but sounds like sound financial advice ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|wink)
2021-06-15 11:39:09,wallstreetbets,"Perhaps you right.
But i stick to things i know.

So i just buying stocks i believe in that i hodl to the price i like"
2021-06-15 10:27:16,wallstreetbets,"I wholeheartedly disagree. A halfassed understanding is a sure fire way to lose your ass. I listened to Options boot camp, read all I could find, watched videos, and learned everything I could before even buying the first call I ever bought. The wise way is to learn before doing, then again, I remember where I’m at, so carry on."
2021-06-15 11:24:22,wallstreetbets,"Ah excellent, someone who doesn't understand different styles of learning. Some people are auditory learners, some people are visual learners,  and some are tactile learners. One of the most fundamental ways to teach someone about abstract non tangible concepts is through story and the application of said concept to something visual and easy to understand."
2021-06-15 14:19:55,wallstreetbets,At least you admit you're full of shit. You deserve the downvotes you're getting.
2021-06-15 11:12:08,wallstreetbets,Gotcha. Thank you for clarifying. What if I don’t sell my contract by the time it expires? Will it automatically execute and buy the 100 shares at my strike price or will it just expire useless? And what if I don’t have money in my account to buy the 100 shares but it is expired?
2021-06-15 08:08:35,wallstreetbets,Gotcha!
2021-06-15 13:02:24,wallstreetbets,"Thank you so much for all this information! 


Is there a name for what it's called if he had sold the calls? I'm trying to understand what covered and naked calls are and was just wondering if this is it? Did a lot of reading today and still don't get it. Sorry to bug you."
2021-06-15 03:00:43,wallstreetbets,It's like if Emma Watson was just a mouth.
2021-06-15 11:59:55,wallstreetbets,LMFAOO. I was just about to think how smart you guys are
2021-06-15 10:54:06,wallstreetbets,"Alright then, ""only a taste"""
2021-06-15 11:34:38,wallstreetbets,"I was selling puts on BB last week, and some mf's exercised even though it probably lost them money, I wanted to own the shares anyway but I would have made been more had I sold right away"
2021-06-15 06:27:38,wallstreetbets,:D
2021-06-15 11:50:35,wallstreetbets,"10 page stories that don't even explain how most people trade options is not ""easy to understand."""
2021-06-15 14:20:50,wallstreetbets,oh man the downvotes... how will i live with myself
2021-06-15 11:24:05,wallstreetbets,"If you have the cash in your account it will probably be automatically exercised. If you don't have the cash, your brokerage will pay you the difference between the share price and the strike price (x100). If the strike price is $50 and the stock is at $52 at expiration, you will get $200 (2x100).  The important thing to keep in mind is that if the stock price is at $52 two weeks BEFORE expiration then you could probably sell it then for $300.  You will generally make more money closing your options before expiration."
2021-06-15 14:25:21,wallstreetbets,"It’s neither a covered or naked call, those only happen when you sell calls - covered call is if you own the underlying stock and you sell calls against it, naked call is when you do not have any shares - naked calls are extremely risky as the potential loss is unlimited.

This trade is just buying a call option, not sure if there’s any name for it."
2021-06-15 03:26:02,wallstreetbets,"Emma def isn’t know for her tits, so…"
2021-06-15 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Canoo ($GOEV) Investor Day on Thursday( 6/17), Could be BIG Canoo is holding it's Investor Day event this Thursday, the 17th, at 9 am Central Time. 

This is straight from Canoo's website:

*""The event will provide insight into the company's vision to bring electric vehicles to everyone by focusing on use cases and increasing owner productivity while simultaneously generating multiple revenue touchpoints throughout the full vehicle lifecycle. Registrants will hear from: Tony Aquila, Chairman & CEO; Pete Savagian, CTO; Mark Aikman, CMO; Christian Treiber, SVP Global Customer Journey & Aftersales; Sohel Merchant, VP Vehicle Architecture and Richard Kim, VP Design, among others. In addition to presentations, registrants will receive an introduction to the company's proprietary technology, have an opportunity to see the vehicle family and participate in a Q&A session.""*

Reasons I am highly bullish on this event:

\#1. It is being held at Texas Motor Speedway , [details here](https://canooirday.com/)

The event wouldn't be held at a literal racetrack if they didn't plan on showing off their models. This will be the first time their vehicles will be shown live in person and over livestream. This will officially prove that Canoo is ahead of all other SPAC EV companies.

\#2. The 17th is the day before the Lock-up period ends.

As part of the SPAC agreement, original shareholders of Canoo (aka Legacy Shareholders) agreed not to sell any shares for the first 180 days of Canoo trading on the market.  This period ends on the 18th, the day after Investor Day. I believe Canoo executives chose to hold the event on this day for a reason, and have something big planned for the event. It makes sense for them release big news to create upward movement in the stock to counteract potential selling by legacy holders the day lockup ends. Multiple ideas can be speculated, including the first showing of their Sedan model or even one I explained in [this previous post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nxnw3s/canoo_goev_their_recent_big_news_upcoming/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) 

Another note:

There are about 21,000 $10 call options expiring Friday. If Canoo is goes above $10 in the next couple of days, they will all be ITM. And you know what that means....

Disclosure:

This is not financial advice and is pure speculation."
2021-06-15 00:11:56,wallstreetbets,"Well maybe my calls won’t expire worthless then, saw some unusual options & decided to jump in a few weeks ago🤷🏻‍♀️"
2021-06-15 08:11:41,wallstreetbets,So this is the new pump?
2021-06-14 23:38:33,wallstreetbets,"It would be pumping so hard (like 50%+) right now if WSB jumps on it. [200k calls (20M shares) that need to be hedged for a stock with 100M float](https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/GOEV/put-call-ratios) , most of the calls opened is on the 10-15 strikes."

2021-06-14 23:39:29,wallstreetbets,"Good luck (honestly).

But this stock is 💩. Sold for a 45% loss. Slowly making it back with my 2nd ride on $AMC."
2021-06-15 08:22:34,wallstreetbets,Unless Canoo has a car that speeds around that track like a Tesla. I’m holding this company with the idea that announcements are similar to hype and dump of Tesla.
2021-06-15 01:15:54,wallstreetbets,"Another pump and dump. They don't have the money to get to volume production without going bankrupt. Unless they can raise funds they are toast.

Not sure... Look at RIDE and WKHS to figure out where this is all headed."
2021-06-15 08:35:50,wallstreetbets,Pretty sure people posting this ticker are 100% shills
2021-06-15 00:00:41,wallstreetbets,I could never buy stock in a company that plans to try selling such ugly vehicles.
2021-06-15 00:27:39,wallstreetbets,same hopefully it goes up and we don't end up red
2021-06-15 02:39:14,wallstreetbets,Yeh lol. Bsame thing here.
2021-06-15 08:12:48,wallstreetbets,Lol that’s the only way we learn.
2021-06-15 01:20:21,wallstreetbets,"They will demo their new platform that can be built in micro factories that have no steering wheel, no wheels, no battery, and no doors, but the space will be just amazing and versatile. The great thing about no wheels, is you can have a tea party in it without worrying about stuff falling down due to bad driving conditions. Definitely the new big thing that Apple will want to buy from them."
2021-06-14 23:45:38,wallstreetbets,"Well, yeah, I can see why you consider it shit. You sold for a loss… I’ve only made money on it so far."
2021-06-15 00:00:13,wallstreetbets,Eyy brother from another mother! I had a micro cap company blow up my account by 45% lol. Great lesson but fuk does it suck having to make it back elsewhere
2021-06-15 00:32:28,wallstreetbets,Just because you lost money doesn’t mean the stock is shit. It’s an extremely solid company and I feel that you will regret selling.
2021-06-15 01:17:15,wallstreetbets,"If you can't tell that Canoo is 100x more legitimate than RIDE and WKHS, you have done 0 due diligence. Also, they probably will need to raise more capital eventually. Luckily their CEO became a billionaire by raising capital for his past companies and isn't a fraud."
2021-06-15 09:05:02,wallstreetbets,They have $600m cash on hand you smooth brain.
2021-06-15 01:30:05,wallstreetbets,Sorry they don't sell the penis-extending vehicles that you seem to need
2021-06-15 08:13:46,wallstreetbets,Everything you said … and raise money.
2021-06-14 23:50:11,wallstreetbets,"Yep. I bought in February, it was then slapped with a class action, and has been hovering at $8-$9 for a month. No PR. Featured deals have fallen through. Fired their entire leadership, and it still didn't move. 

Again, If you're in it, I'm rooting for you. Just moved my money to another gamble, made most of it back, and waiting on the next SS.

If this goes up, we've both won."
2021-06-15 08:15:18,wallstreetbets,How big is your bag?
2021-06-15 08:19:19,wallstreetbets,Lol he became billionaire by raising capital. What a visionary!
2021-06-15 01:29:41,wallstreetbets,"Whatever, let me know when the get to production. I have no positions so don't really care."
2021-06-15 10:24:52,wallstreetbets,"And?

NIO produces as of Q1' 2021 about 20,000 vehicles per quarter. They are still trying to grow. Their combined operating losses for the last three years, which is from when they started selling cars (so not counting the operating losses before that) is about $2.5B USD.

RIDE, which bought for cheap an old plant from GM that they were updating to produce their Endurance pickup truck, is not yet at any level of production and by year end is looking at having exhausted the $600M they had  without any significant level of production.

VW, has committed to spend over $90B on going to EV.

TSLA has raised multiple times billions of dollars to fund operations. It is only recently that they have been operating cash flow positive (and they still have raised more money to continue to expand... they might have crossed the threshold going forward and not need to raise more money, but will see).

All these companies have been able to put together a prototype for cheap, yet trying to actually move forward to production has been a major challenge that has cost a lot. Yet, somehow you think GOEV will magically escape the challenges of getting to production levels where they can be operating cash flow/income positive.

$600M is chump change here and unless they can raises substantial amounts of money more they will go bankrupt sooner or later. Maybe they can move forward and things will work out and investors will decide it is worthwhile to throw more money at them, but in an increasingly competitive landscape with established players finally moving, might not be so easy to raise that money."

2021-06-15 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"PLTR DD - CALLING ALL PALANTARDS!!! What is PLTR and why now? PLTR has come up in this subreddit a lot in the past and people have been burned on it as well. I've lost thousands on PLTR but i'm still holding because the company is beyond incredible. One of the biggest questions i've seen that nobody truly understands is ""What is Palantir? What do they do?"", so let me attempt to explain wtf they do... Precursor, this isn't an in-depth analyses of PLTR fundamentals and financials. If you want to look at their fundamentals you can check some other dd like this [one](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n9ydod/palantirs_pltr_fundamentals_just_became_even/). It's about a month old, but it's still incredibly relevant now. This post is meant to address the general question of what PLTR is as a company, what they do, and bring some general attention to the interesting options volume this week.

*This is not financial advice. Do your own research!!! The more research i did in PLTR the more bullish i became.*

# TL;DR

\- PLTR visualizes abstract data in a meaningful way for any business to easily analyze and efficiently run their business.

\- PLTR is a modular system that allows for companies to connect with each other seemlessly creating an interconnected community for data to travel which will create waves in how business is conducted.

\- PLTR is an engineering master piece that is incredibly unique. For anyone to compete with them will be difficult to put it lightly.

\- PLTR has been sleeping for a while, it's ready for a rally if we can get enough attention due to high Open Interest and low IV.

\- [Karp is a Giga Chad](https://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQwLx-qpgHrcSU27NjPrIq6LBMCkjMG6HIfjZCcVKRmhQmlyNwx)

# What is Palantir?

""Palantir is a platform for data analytics and ai"", I've seen this thrown around quite a bit, and honestly wtf does that mean? I'm a programmer and even i don't fucking get it. Well all became clear after the [demo day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFP3sBQfaww) came out, where finally PLTR showcased their platforms which people are sleepin on. Before we can answer what PLTR is, we need to answer ""what is data""? Data is the logical representation of the real world. Any largescale business will always collect a ton of data most often stored in texts such as spreadsheets or databases (which requires programming knowledge to navigate through). So what does PLTR do with this data? Well they consolidate a company's data and displays it in a comprehensible easily digestible UI for the company to use. (Note that they take company's data, PLTR doesn't gather or store any data of it's own) Easy right? This allows for pretty much any company/organization like [the CDC for medicine](https://www.wsj.com/articles/palantir-to-help-u-s-track-covid-19-vaccines-11603367276), the [military for national security](https://www.palantir.com/palantir-gotham/21-launch/), and the [stock market for financial fraud](https://twitter.com/PalantirTech/status/1399747624463486986) (stock market is only rumors for now but hopefully PLTR HELP US FIND THE HEDGIES THAT MANIPULATE THE MARKET) . But how insane is this? Working with that much data is a nightmare. In a society where data is already a necessity, being able to look through and analyze data quickly for any anomalies or patterns is crucial to any company and is often overwhelming. With PLTR a normal non-technical operator can click their computer to pull up an order, or an issue that PLTR detected, make any changes and or notify whoever needs the attention. Let's take the CDC for example. When the vaccine rolled out, PLTR had a huge hand in this. PLTR gives visual display of where the vaccine is going, how many, and any issues that has risen if any, allowing for fast response time. You can imagine PLTR displaying a map with the various routes to different deployment sites with pictures of a little truck representing the shipments being routed to their destination. An operator can click 1 of these shipments/routes and pull up any data of that specific point. With data being displayed and organized in this way it makes it easy to analyze data, where are things going, what kind of picture does the data represent, rather than staring at a spreadsheet of numbers. Now this is just an example, PLTR is general enough and customizable enough where it can represent any business/organization's structure. Once data is organized it opens up the possibility for even further opportunities such as creating simulations of potential issues that can happen in order to forsee and plan for various situations. It allows data to be clean enough to train machine learning algorithms (a big problem with ML is that data isn't clean or has weird edge cases that fucks up the model. If you talk to any data/ml engineer they will typically mention most of their job is cleaning data over actual application). Companies can create scripts or AI to respond to events if needed. It can be as simple as notifying an executive if an issue occurs, or completely issuing a rollback order if there's a sudden spike of side effects for the covid vaccine which will be represented in the data. It's the ultimate data representation/analysis platform that any company can utilize and it's fucking insane, i still casn't believe PLTR managed to do this. But it brings up a few problems.

# Why Palantir?

Why can't companies just create their own platform? Because it's expensive, time consuming, and complicated. A common issue large companies have is simply having too much data. Take the automotive industry for example and self driving. Driving data needs to be collected and stored for AI. That's a lot of data... like pentabytes of data if not more.... Now let's say there's data being collected in America, the signs and the messages on side walks, are different than those that are in the UK. If you have a dataset from the UK well that data comes with it's own issues and rules, this creates a problem called ""data silos"" meaning data is separated into it's own little circle separated from other data silos. If the company decides to make a platform to analyze these 2 different types of data, they will have to consolidate, organize, and create 2 kinds of platforms for it. Now this example is only 2, large businesses have dozens of data silos that are often abandoned or isolated. PLTR is a generalized platform that encompasses any and all kinds of data which they themselves work closely with companies in order to cater to what they need. Why can't companies create a general platform themselves? Because it's an engineering nightmare and PLTR is an engineering masterpiece.... It is so insanely difficult to create something general enough to fit any and all data... but PLTR has done exactly that. The best comparison i can correlate this to is computers. Before generalized computers, computers would be built and deployed to do 1 job and 1 job only. Once generalized computers came out it's used everywhere and no company develops their own computer for a single job, they go out and buy a computer, in this case, any company that manages data can benefit from PLTR.

Another benefit we see from PLTR is that PLTR is 1 huge modular system. If a person from 1 company wants to share data with another company that utilizes PLTR they can do so seemlessly. PLTR talks with each other and easily sends data to and from. Imagine if hospitals or universities adapted this system. You no longer have to manually print a transcript and submit it to the other university's administration and then wait for it to be processed for a few days. If your medical records are stored in 1 hospital and you get sent to the ER in another hospital, your main hospital can send your medical records to the ER you're at seemlessly and quickly. Its insane how misunderstood PLTR is, but it's a far reaching company that will dig into the roots of all whether you jump into it or not, all i'm doing is trying to have it move sooner than later. Deep roots are not reached by the forst.

Karp is a giga chad. Fucking guy got the intelligence of Elon Musk if not more, and the hair to fucking prove it. If you want to witness it first hand, listen to some of his[interviews](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjjHdys2Ph4). A lot of his philosophies are amazing and I believe in his abilities to make PLTR go to the moon. 🌑🌑🌑

# Why now?

I did a DD on AMC a week ago calling the rally from $20 -> $70. Will the same happen with PLTR? **It can** but it'll need some help. Not gonna explain how the squeeze works as it's beyond the scope of this post. If you want check out the [DD i did on AMC](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nqa5x8/why_amc_is_rallying_and_why_it_will_continue/), i explain the idea there.

[PLTR Option Chain from Yahoo Finance](https://preview.redd.it/e10egiyiac571.png?width=1363&format=png&auto=webp&s=db92a97940da7189c65e524fe3e6595c70eb638e)

fucking options volume is even higher than AMC when i did AMC's DD. Now PLTR has a larger market cap than AMC so we probably won't see a run up as large as AMC but it's still a great stock with great opportunity. If we can get enough people to get on PLTR it can definitely pop. The options volume is spread out very nicely through the 20-30 range which is perfect for launching the price forward. Meme stocks typically has a second coming. GME had a 2nd wind, BB had a 2nd wind, AMC's 2nd wind is nuttier than it's first one ffs, it looks like it's about time for PLTR to have it's 2nd wind, but it needs more attention.

# Why not AMC/GME/BB/etc?

**I love memes and have made a lot of money off memes.** As much as I love AMC and GME, I sold at the top. I sold AMC at 70, and i sold GME at 400. Why? **Because Meme stocks need to cool down**. This isn't because of hedgies or any kind of attacks. Stocks that are very volatile causes their options to be ridiculously expensive, which prevents the potential for a rally from happening because it's much harder for people to buy in options. Ultimately I don't want to be a bag holder, and i don't want others to be bag holding (rip GME 400$ holders and AMC 70$ holders). Everyone should look for selling opportunities, for GME it was RH closing down and AMC was when the rally ran it's course. (Check the AMC DD above if you need proof, i updated the post as soon as i sold at $70. GME unfortunately I have no proof for) I will still look for opportunities to buy into GME/AMC again once it's cooled down a bit but for now, PLTR is really cheap, volatility is really low, and we're sitting at the floor right now with huge potential for it to explode. People have been burnt before when PLTR was cooling off from the past, but now **the second coming is near....** We're at the floor right now so if the narrative doesn't play out it's also just a great stock to hold.

# Reversal/Exit

Unfortunately PLTR doesn't have the same attention as AMC did when i wrote the last DD, so in order for it to pop off this week PLTR will need some love. Even if not enough people realizes how amazing it actually is then it'll just sit steady and grow over time. For PLTR i don't really have an exit. If it does rally i will sell and let it cool, but i'll update this post if that happens. If that doesn't ever happen, then i'll just keep PLTR as a long term hold, and re-allocate funds to riskier plays based on my risk tolerance and when opportunity arises. Other than that I'm more than happy to hold PLTR for years to come. PLTR already has pretty much everything i own right now... All my money, my commitment, my wife... o\_o PLTR is my wife's boyfriend.

2021-06-15 02:27:02,wallstreetbets,PLTR is the future. 1 trillion market cap in 7 years.
2021-06-14 23:53:23,wallstreetbets,ITS JUST LIKE THAT STAR WARS GUY!! $25.5 calls 6/18 purchased today🤝🤝🤝
2021-06-15 00:48:31,wallstreetbets,Been selling weekly CC and decided to stop doing that today given the +25% price increase we've seen in the past week or so. If it blows through $25 who knows when it'll find a new place to trade flat at for 3 months
2021-06-15 00:50:15,wallstreetbets,"You had me at PLTR.

waiting for some current options to roll over Friday, then splitting profit to palantir and corsair... Getting back into long plays for the summer."
2021-06-15 01:38:08,wallstreetbets,300 shares averaged around 20.5…let’s start printing brrr
2021-06-15 01:58:24,wallstreetbets,"Agreed and hopeful that PLTR is primed .

Few hundred shares  +   81 x 1/21/22 $65c   +   10 x 6/17/22 $45c"
2021-06-15 02:03:25,wallstreetbets,better pop off cuz i have 20x $30 calls 1/21/22
2021-06-15 03:32:38,wallstreetbets,Got my PLTR ages ago. Am getting ready for Friday war. AMC!
2021-06-15 00:33:47,wallstreetbets,PLTR is still under the radar... it's for people who like printing tendies
2021-06-15 00:23:13,wallstreetbets,"640S at 23.80 holding strong
TITAN lift me up please 🙌🙌🙌🌕"
2021-06-15 01:06:55,wallstreetbets,PLTR & ASO are the real rockets!
2021-06-15 01:23:56,wallstreetbets,This is long and it's late so I'm not gonna read it but yeah I have 1200 shares and wish I had more.  Good long term investment; not sure when it's gonna go up but I'll see you at $1000+ in 10-15 years.
2021-06-15 03:52:53,wallstreetbets,"Im in. Great post OP, lets make some tendies."
2021-06-15 06:21:34,wallstreetbets,Pltr said on the last earnings call they were building iron man suits and skynet. Bullish af. 🚀🚀🚀
2021-06-15 08:31:38,wallstreetbets,"Only reason I hold PLTR is once the AI becomes sentient, it’s first objective is going to be to destroy those that did not help bring about its creation. Just doin my part to not be culled"
2021-06-15 08:37:32,wallstreetbets,"IT BROKE 25, WE GOIN MOONIN 🚀"
2021-06-15 09:27:29,wallstreetbets,I’m with OP and MagiKarp. Palantirs one of the few companies actually making a positive difference and not sucking on PRC’s balls (no offense to my Chinese friends) and selling ppl’s data like all of bigtech
2021-06-15 02:38:31,wallstreetbets,I'm in.  Got  18/Jun 26. 5
2021-06-15 04:33:20,wallstreetbets,"Pltr is the stock i bought for my children, it will probably buy their house one day!"
2021-06-15 04:46:30,wallstreetbets,"I'm sorry but when you're using terms like 'incredibly unique' and 'interconnected community for data to travel' my eyes start rolling.

You say it's difficult for anyone to compete with them but *why*.  When there's this much money on the table there will be competition.  

You know why Twitter, Facebook or Instagram stay relevant?  It's not their fancy code because there's isn't any... maybe in scaling there is some,  it's that they have the users and the money from selling adverts to those users to buy emerging competition or compete in features or new products.  Microsoft dominates lots of business software by leveraging the idea of compatibility and the importance of 'it has to work for your business'. 

Is PLTR in the same place right now? I'm not sure.  I am sure they're using the same technologies as everyone else, code, internet, etc. So why can't others do the same. 

I've not seen anything convincing so far on that. I need to be convinced that the moat is real and that it's difficult to breach."
2021-06-15 07:34:43,wallstreetbets,Palantir>>>> long and strong
2021-06-15 08:26:16,wallstreetbets,I drew a bunch of triangles on the chart and it looks like I'll be shit posting as soon as this thing cracks $25.30.
2021-06-15 08:42:52,wallstreetbets,"Ultra high conviction, I'm in for 10,000 @ $25.04, this company is going to be massive in the coming years. OP is right, buying now is a most likely a win now or win later setup."
2021-06-15 08:45:00,wallstreetbets,TLDR;TLDR: Palantir is pied piper - it's really fucking good but people are too retarded to catch on.
2021-06-15 08:45:55,wallstreetbets,"This is my top high conviction stock for 2021. Last year was Moderna at 31. Before that was Tesla. I have currently 7,000 shares with 10 calls at 30 for 1/22. I’ve been buy since it was at 27 and now cost average down to 21.48. So I’m 😃."
2021-06-15 09:06:41,wallstreetbets,"PLTR IS DA SHEEEEIT!!

2021-06-14 23:08:55,wallstreetbets,"PLTR gets smashed by the $25 wall each and every time. Blue balled me so many times that my balls exploded. Yes, you heard it right. PLTR BLEW UP MY BALLS…along with my portfolio a few months back. i always tread with caution now with PLTR.

just my experience with the stock"
2021-06-15 01:55:44,wallstreetbets,I see PLTR. I upvote. Repeat after me. PLTR is the new TSLA.
2021-06-14 23:17:03,wallstreetbets,"The problem  with PLTR is, that I'm already bagholding much more of them than I ever wanted. It happens that my break-even is just over $25 🙄"
2021-06-15 00:35:35,wallstreetbets,You mother fucker. If PLTR get's stuck in a pump and dump cycle for the next 3 months negating all the real gains we could have had in this time it's 100% on your head.
2021-06-15 00:09:24,wallstreetbets,"Good DD my friend thank you..Ive been in , been raped , still in 🤘"
2021-06-15 00:45:11,wallstreetbets,Finally!
2021-06-15 01:27:05,wallstreetbets,Love the company. I’m holding for the years to come and not selling any 🚀
2021-06-15 01:37:21,wallstreetbets,"Options are fun! But not with this stock. I love the fundamentals and it's a big juicy peach of an investment oppurtunity. I've got shares thoudmgh because it's just not one of those pop goes the weasel type stocks.  Not sure why, I expected huge bullish trends already."
2021-06-15 01:37:50,wallstreetbets,The OG

2021-06-15 08:22:48,wallstreetbets,Good DD. My bull case for PLTR is simple. It made me smart and I’m fucking retarded. Imagine what it can do for smart people
2021-06-15 08:31:17,wallstreetbets,PLTR is a long term investment.  Buy alot now and sell OTM CC along the way for income.
2021-06-15 09:24:32,wallstreetbets,27 calls 7/9 tendies
2021-06-15 09:25:25,wallstreetbets,"1,200 shares @ \~$22 checking in"
2021-06-15 09:27:20,wallstreetbets,Let’s go PLTR!
2021-06-15 09:39:59,wallstreetbets,"Up until a couple months ago, the premiums for PLTR we're insane. Even on a pull back you could sell OTM calls and puts for $$$ I hope we get back to those days."
2021-06-15 10:08:22,wallstreetbets,this fucker will simply not get past the 25.5 wall
2021-06-14 23:24:05,wallstreetbets,I’m going to assume a solid DD on PLTR means price go down.
2021-06-15 00:13:33,wallstreetbets,"PLTR is the machine in the TV show person of interest… they created true AI… the more I rewatch the show the more I’m like… this is fucking Palantir… this whole TV show was made of whisper from Palantir when it was CIA project 😱😱😱

This is my biggest holding and i’m just adding on every dip.

🎤 drop"
2021-06-15 03:37:38,wallstreetbets,Too much words
2021-06-15 05:02:12,wallstreetbets,PLTR needs to slow down. My CC's are crying 😥
2021-06-15 05:09:37,wallstreetbets,Setting on 672 shares and 2 18$ calls expiring next June. I’ll buy some more contracts though. That’ll atleast cover the Tesla.
2021-06-15 05:18:44,wallstreetbets,Can someone read that and tell me what it says?
2021-06-15 05:46:36,wallstreetbets,Great stuff pal!
2021-06-15 06:10:20,wallstreetbets,"Amen brother. My calls all expired worthless last month, but I still have the shares. Time to get more calls."
2021-06-15 07:04:52,wallstreetbets,"I’m very heavy in PLTR since below 20$.
   
I just want to see PLTR at 50$. That’s it."
2021-06-15 03:12:44,wallstreetbets,"Say no more; You had me at PLTR.



Btw, that guy looks sexy af. No homo."
2021-06-15 03:20:30,wallstreetbets,"The biggest problem I have with this company is the same problem I have with this post. It's 90% marketing gibberish that means absolutely nothing in the real world. Maybe there's an explanation somewhere in there of what this company actually does, but I will never know because my brain utterly rejects the bombardment of marketing where there should be explanation. It feels like a scam."
2021-06-15 00:03:58,wallstreetbets,"I wouldn't start with Palanir visualizes data since eit takes a lot of database work to make those visualizations meaningful. I'd say that Palantir is like the combinations of all these piecemeal software products (e.g., MSFT, AXY, IBM, etc.,) put I to a full architecture suite. To me it makes actual machine learning possible since that first starts with getting the right data structure. It's essentially consolidating the machine learning tool space into MSFT like product. 

I'd like to see it rise and get more clients and become a standard since it's a great idea."
2021-06-15 00:03:13,wallstreetbets,It could still go down or trade side ways after all that. Has happened before and will happen again.
2021-06-15 00:48:34,wallstreetbets,My biggest bag. Got out on the way down and back in Friday and today. Little trigger shy but I’ll come around.. it’s a great play long. I get the short play to but long is the way here IMO
2021-06-15 01:14:45,wallstreetbets,"What does 40x $27 calls 7/9 mean.

Feel like a retard asking ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|grimacing)![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|grimacing)"
2021-06-15 01:56:33,wallstreetbets,"Love it, but pleaz; I don't want it to be algoed with the memes."
2021-06-15 02:48:45,wallstreetbets,Tell gigachad not to take all the profits and you have a much better chance to see it run. Highest paid ceo of the last 20 years 😬
2021-06-15 05:51:43,wallstreetbets,"Holy moly.. you what? You SOLD... GME? OMG really?
Oh.. wait.. I sold at 340 during the last run as well.. ;)
Ok now to look into PLTR..."
2021-06-15 07:56:36,wallstreetbets,Pltr is actually a good company that produces something. Don't P&D this.
2021-06-15 07:34:43,wallstreetbets,"I mean, I’m long on palantir (shares and 2023 calls mostly) but… comparing it at all to AMC is disingenuous. The size, the ownership, the market dynamics… also, I can’t tell but it looks like you’re highlighting options volume, not OI. Options volume is meaningless for what you’re implying."
2021-06-15 06:31:13,wallstreetbets,"Ah the company with the government as it's raison d'être, but with a CEO who declined an invitation with then-president Trump. 

Yikes"
2021-06-15 04:11:48,wallstreetbets,Did anyone actually read the part where OP talks about “why not amc/gme etc”? This guy is a fucking shill. Literally talks about AMC running its course. This is nuts guys. They’re literally out here trying very hard to pull people from AMC…Do not get distracted apes.
2021-06-15 04:03:16,wallstreetbets,Shill post
2021-06-15 02:11:52,wallstreetbets,"This company is Prestige Worldwide.. 

This whole post is suspect and cringe..

Hold GME and AMC"
2021-06-15 02:33:47,wallstreetbets,If I invest in palantir dont I kinda have blood on my hands?
2021-06-15 03:46:01,wallstreetbets,I still don't like it. 👁🐽👁
2021-06-15 00:30:52,wallstreetbets,Forget pltr buy bb
2021-06-15 07:09:52,wallstreetbets,IV is extremely low and now it’s time to buy some OTM calls before these retards fomo in
2021-06-15 07:21:01,wallstreetbets,what app i should use? (europe)
2021-06-15 08:09:16,wallstreetbets,Check my profile. Lost 60k on PLTR CALLS. 🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂
2021-06-15 08:18:48,wallstreetbets,PLTR is the truth. Sleeping giant. I sleep well at night with 2400 shares
2021-06-15 08:19:18,wallstreetbets,"Been in PLTR since day one.  Before I had to avoid call options since the IV was so high, but now they’re affordable so I loaded up.

Buying call options is the best way to gain (or lose) money, the people you see with monster gains on GME, AMC, etc bought call options when the stock down and IV was low."
2021-06-15 08:19:58,wallstreetbets,"This is major Tom to ground control, we're stepping through the doooor...."
2021-06-15 08:56:46,wallstreetbets,"By far my highest conviction position. 1,500 shares and a bunch of Jan 2022 and 2023 leaps"
2021-06-15 09:16:45,wallstreetbets,"I've already got 3100 shares @ 21.96, going to enjoy the rocket ship from here on out."
2021-06-15 09:32:29,wallstreetbets,It’s not as unique as you’d think. The data analytics field is definitely competitive. We just had a client come to us because they weren’t happy with palantir. It looks great but the actual utility is lower than you’d expect.
2021-06-15 09:49:54,wallstreetbets,Holding above 25 this morn let’s goooo!
2021-06-15 09:57:48,wallstreetbets,"Calls are HELLA cheap, buy this shit now!!!"
2021-06-15 10:47:02,wallstreetbets,"TLDR but just so you know, PLTR is a cover for a 3 letter agency.  Which is great.  It literally can't go bankrupt or run out of money.  A government contract will magically appear when they need cash.  But at least know what you are buying."

2021-06-15 03:48:51,wallstreetbets,PLTR also provides software for ICE. Fuck em
2021-06-15 07:50:37,wallstreetbets,"Lame. IF you were really as savvy as you think, you'd be making money on these dips n rips AMC & GME. Instead you're just trying to get people not to buy those 2 stocks, or even worse, lose their positions.

""AMC rally ran  its course"" lol you're a EXTRA retarded ape. Actually, you're not even an ape."
2021-06-14 23:59:25,wallstreetbets,"If we bring PLTR back lets bring NIO back to this conversation. This sub used to be all about NIO, TSLA and PLTR a year ago this time around."

2021-06-15 07:03:37,wallstreetbets,I like PLTR but did the guy do research on the stock structure? It literally pays its employees off using proceeds from stock price increases

Lol. See you soon."
2021-06-15 07:59:20,wallstreetbets,"It just sounds like they’re a bunch of consultants doing data reports in Power BI for other companies. I don’t get the hype and the valuation. 

I think at 47 Billy, Palantir is wayy overpriced. They shot up too fast and are dependent on irregular events (like the pandemic) to land big contracts."

2021-06-15 02:19:19,wallstreetbets,soon as it passes 25.30 (hint: it closed at 25 today)
2021-06-15 01:16:15,wallstreetbets,OP thinks 7/9 or 1/21 (9/7 or 21/1 for those of us that struggle to read backwards dates)

But in the past when it hit that 25$ wall, it was cooling off as i mentioned. Options book was thin and IV was ridiculously high. Then PLTR got slaughtered when there was a lot of market fears of inflation. Now inflationary fears are still here but are being priced in, market is going back up, PLTR recovered to 25, Option book is looking hella healthy, memes have a 2nd coming, i'm jumping in with all i got. 🚀🚀🚀"

2021-06-15 03:33:42,wallstreetbets,My feelings exactly. Been in since November and been happy that we've skirted under the retard radar.
2021-06-15 02:50:34,wallstreetbets,I’ve had a few options expire but I also had a couple right before that $40 run 😎

2021-06-15 00:08:03,wallstreetbets,"But that's with all stocks and all opportunities. The potential is there, but it won't **always** happen hence my section on the reversal. If there's no love for it, it won't move much. Right now the regime shift is going back into growth stocks so stocks like PLTR can benefit which makes me pretty confident in this. But you are definitely right, there is a chance for it to sit flat, or go down! But in that case hold for the long run. As i said in the post PLTR is a short AND long term play. If it doesn't pop off yet, hopefully it will in the near future. That's our job as investors, trying to sniff out opportunity. DFV bag held GME for nearly a year or 2 while everyone questioned his sanity before it finally popped off and he became instant multi-millionaire. Cathie Woods is loading the hell up on PLTR because she sees it's potential, and I'm trying to jump into this opportunity before it pops off"

2021-06-15 03:16:54,wallstreetbets,"This is actually an interesting question. If you're addressing PLTR's involvement with the military, it's role in privacy and civil liberties, Alex Karp has fairly interesting ideologies. One of PLTR's goals is actually to protect data. One thing i failed to cover in the post is PLTR's terrific data security and segregation. It requires users to have specific permissions and authorization in order to access certain data which helps protect the data that PLTR is reasoning with. With PLTR being this powerful it allows for full control and monitoring of who has access to the data and when did they access it. This gives a lot of power to PLTR though which means you need to trust Karp. Karp mentioned in an interview ""[I didn't sign up for the government to know when I smoke a joint or have an affair](https://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2013/08/14/agent-of-intelligence-how-a-deviant-philosopher-built-palantir-a-cia-funded-data-mining-juggernaut/?sh=164275307785)"", while this is a fairly crude statement, it demonstrates his moral compass of protecting people's privacy while dealing with all this data. Karp also has a firm understanding of his rights and what's in his control as a CEO. As i quoted in the article he sued the Army for basically trying to create their own version of PLTR at a much higher price than what PLTR can offer. This action demonstrates that the leadership of PLTR is strong with their ideals and will exercise it so that powerful organizations like the military won't push them over for underhanded purposes.  Bigger question now is do you trust Karp and PLTR. I personally do after listening to quite a [few of his interviews](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBlGMHiPf1U&t=1s). He's a very essentric yet strong and intelligent individual but that's my evaluation. Feel free to look into him on your own. 

Now if you're talking about PLTR's role in warfare like the speculation that the US used [PLTR to track Osama Bin Laden](https://mse238blog.stanford.edu/2017/07/jchoi8/palantir-big-data-possibly-helped-catch-bin-laden/) unfortunately that's more of a question for the US political ideologies not PLTR. PLTR is nothing more than a tool, it can be used to track terrorists or it can be used to fight a global pandemic. Alex Karp does a very good job at being selective with his clients and firm with his ideologies, but there's only so much influence Karp and Peter Thiel can do on their own. I say its a good thing that PLTR has influence over these governing bodies, but that's because I trust Karp as a CEO. 

This is my take on PLTR's ethical views, hopefully i addressed your question. If not please elaborate."

2021-06-15 00:54:45,wallstreetbets,"Get it to move and it will. Reddit got it to move to $40 before. now that we have gamma potential in the option chain it can move again. But ofc thats ""can"". meme stocks typically make a 2nd appearance. People said the same thing ""GME is dead"" when it went from 400 -> 45 and now its back at 200. But as u said if thats not the case and it fits my reversal just sell it off and buy something else, we are at the floor right now so the risk is relatively low. iv is low so no iv crush to fear. its current fair value is around 27, but thats off of a financial model that i hadnt release so stock holding is pretty stable. If it dont pop off in the next few weeks will look for another play, but if we have enough movement now the short term is there."

Given how many wildly successful businesses are based off of open source code (or god forbid libre code under the GPL) the decision of Palantir to keep such a controversial product proprietary speaks louder than any press release.

In the end my fear is that my choice has been made for me.

Intel is beat down but rightfully so considering they need nearly flawless technical execution over the next 3 years to ensure AMD doesn’t go from 10% mark share to 33% in the $16B data center CPU market.

Guess who’s stock is on 28% discount (analysts target price). None other than Mama Su’s A-M-D. 

The Xilinx merger will close in Q4 according to most semiconductards. 

Prior to that the price will run to $100+ and likely overshoot considering the explosive growth AMD is experiencing.

Name of the game is ARG (Toronto Exchange) - ARG entry price: $1.3/sh, in for 72K. Exit price $3/sh

**Industry**

Strong signs point to long term tailwinds for Copper with futures trading at $4.50/lb+ in 2022E. GS/BAML estimates betting over 13K per tonne. Copper is here to stay. Biden is our saviour - and will rapidly grow industrial sectors, such as electric vehicle batteries and semiconductor wiring. With the long lead time required for copper mines, it's a simple supply and demand issue.

**Rationale for ARG**

1.	65-70mm EBITDA turns into >$50mm of FCF ($6mm maint capex, $5mm int expense etc which will decline post refi; \~5-10mm more in corp G&A and some W/C reversal)...all against a US$221mm mkt cap and (now) no net leverage. So <4.5x unlevered FCF basically.  

2.	This is tailings treatment which theoretically has less risk than a typical mine  

3.	Electricity (largest cost) locked in below mkt for a v long time and an agreement w the mine operator to basically roll their operating contract every 3yrs for a v long time too (for which they pay a chunky royalty).  

4.	If you believe any of the B/S Biden and all global leaders are spouting re emissions reductions, copper is going to go parabolic...which of course you are massively levered to here as well   5

5. Management team has repeatedly said they are undervalued in their investor calls, and is looking to push for a sale.. lets just say they have got some interest 📷   

**Why is it Cheap?**

1.	Tight float/no liquidity (4-5 dudes own 70% of the co); we all know why though 📷 . Meaning your retard dollars can actually make a difference. 

2.	Canadian microcap/no coverage  Will start SHITTING cash divs pronto (from 2H) once they get a global refi done (should be 1H). There's operational upside (on throughput) too but no need to bake any of that in. 3x FCF w no leverage is the wrong price.  

BUT DYOR, I'm betting everything on ARG. Worst case i'll still be 40, fat and divorced. YOLO. You retards I'm new here .. did i do this right?

**Money Statements:**

I have looked at the money statements and according to my projections, you can buy a lambo. I looked at several ratios that confirmed the money is good. My wife's bf also confirmed this.

**Covid-19:**

Covid-19 is a pandemic that makes the companies get more money. See the above money statements analysis.

**Conclusion:**

in for 3,000 shares @ $11.31. Will post loss porn

My main winner is Sofi and it’s been getting its ass kicked despite being heavily undervalued.

I’m in a few other growth plays like open and a few spaaaacs which I can’t mention here and they’re all being shorted by 30-60% of daily volume. Same shit for palantir and a few other really popular growths. Sofi so far has been the most egregious offender as the float should be around 30% shorted total for a really good company. 

It’s really bizarre to see all these decent companies shorted into the ground. One thing I’ve seen is that iwm and related russell etfs have been similarly shorted. Basically any etf containing amc or Gme has been shorted to oblivion in the same manner. Is this some weird algo across the board shorting to stop Gme/amc?

2021-06-15 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"INTC play Quick DD.  A few days ago, rumors started popping up that Intel is looking into buying chipmaker SiFive.  SiFive is a designer of chips that are based on the RISC-V architecture, an attempt to bring open-source standards to semiconductor design making it cheaper and accessible to customers.  This would give Intel an opportunity to keep pace with Nvidia, which is in the process of acquiring Arm(could potentially be blocked by regulators).  SiFive is currently valued at 500 million, while Intel has 22.375 billion in cash on hand.  

&#x200B;

The reason this interests me is the options activity today, specifically the $62 strike expiring July 2.  As of last Friday, the open interest was sitting at 223.  Today, the volume at that strike and date was almost 59,694.  That's a huge increase in interest.  The 7/9 $62 strike had an open interest of 134 from Friday, and a volume of 1,750 today.  There is also a shitload volume and open interest(40,000 for 7/16 $62.50) for each strike from $50-75 strikes for July 16.  All in all, there are 263,557 call contracts open vs 26,969 puts.  IV is around 25% for most of these contracts as well. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The daily chart shows its been stuck in the $56-58 range since May 21, and just broke through that $58 resistance today.  There is also a big fucking gap from $59-62 that needs to be filled.  This looks extremely promising to me, and if it is confirmed that Intel is planning to acquire SiFive in the next few days or next week, I think we could see some significant upside very quickly, and if that happens, those calls expiring in 2-3 weeks will go in the money and this fucker will fly when market makers buy shares to hedge.

Originally posted to my channel --  information should be up to date but may have missed grammatical shorthand errors. All info is post-USPS debacle, and assumes they get ZERO part of the contract in the future.

## Intro

   * Later, AMP Electric Vehicles went public in 2010 trading on the OTC market under the ticker AMPD
   * Acquired the Workhorse brand and assembly plant in March of 2013
   * The asset acquisition established them as an Original Equipment manufacturer, or “OEM”
   * March of 2015 AMP formally changed its name to Workhorse Group Incorporated
* Workhorse today trades under the ticker WKHS
   * Market Cap: $1.8 billion (finviz)
   * Share Price: $15.05

## Delivery Vans

## “BUILT SPECIFICALLY FOR LAST-MILE DELIVERY”

**""Last mile** is a term used in [supply chain management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain_management) and [transportation planning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transportation_planning) to describe the last leg of a journey comprising the movement of people and goods from a [transportation hub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transportation_hub) to a final destination."" - Wikipedia, baby.

C-Series Vehicles

* C1000 & C650
   * 324” vs 247” length
   * 122” height
   * 75 mph topspeed
   * 100-160 mile range
   * 600 packages vs 450 packages
   * C-Series Vehicles feature a 100% composite monocoque body eliminating 4,000 lbs. of chassis and body weight compared to a conventional, internal combustion vehicle while carrying the same cargo volume and payload
   * 40 MPGe fuel efficiency for C-Series vs. 6 MPG for UPS
   * Reduced operating cost from \~$1.00/mile to \~$0.36/mile(1)
   * Workhorse states based on UPS data, customers would see a positive ROI within just 3 years when factoring in fuel, maintenance, and infrastructure costs.

UPS of course, has been acting as their partner in drone delivery testing for the Horsefly, their custom built, high-efficiency delivery UAV that is fully integrated with their line of electric delivery trucks.

## Horsefly

* Designed with a maximum gross weight of 30 lbs., the Horsefly carries a 10 lb. payload with a maximum air speed of 50 mph, and has the ability to automatically lower packages safely from 50 feet above
* The HorseFly system is designed to conform to the FAA guidelines for UAV operation in the U.S.
* The autonomous system is integrated with the C1000 Electric Delivery Vehicles. The truck is the jumping off point for the drone and then the pair will meet after the delivery is complete. The truck features a control center for the driver and auto-landing HorseFly roof with charging capabilities.
* Recent updates to the drone allow for point-to-point package delivery without the need for a c1000
* Reduces per package last-mile cost by up to 95% (\~$0.04 per mile vs. \~$1.00 for gas vehicle)
* The recently granted HorseFly™ patent covers any drone utilization integrated with conventional vehicle
* COVID-19 accelerated e-commerce experimentation and adoption with contactless drone deliveries

## Additional Projects

* Metron:  cloud-based, remote management system to manage and track the performance of all of the vehicle as a real-time solution for fleet managers
* Aeres Delivery App -  a custom HorseFly user control center. Location, updates, and real-time flight video are just some of the features.
* W-15, an electric pickup prototype, sold to Lordstown for 10% equity stake
* Surefly, an electric VTOL, sold to Moog $5million
* Additionally, they entered a Joint Venture centered around the sharing and advancement of technology and IP related to the development of unmanned aerial systems (UAS).

## Financials

Full Year 2020 (vs 2019)

Sales: $1.4m ($377k in 2019)

Cost of Goods sold: $13.1m ($5.8m in 2019)

General Expenses: $20.2m ($10.2m in 2019)

R&D Expenses: $9.1m ($8.2m in 2019)

Other Income: $321.1m ($15.8m in 2019) \*THIS IS DUE TO THEIR EQUITY STAKE IN \[RIDE\]

Net Income: $69.8m (-$37.2m in 2019) \*\*ONLY POSITIVE DUE TO OTHER INCOME

&#x200B;

Additional Info:

* 8,000 vehicle backlog including Pritchard Companies and Pride Group Enterprises. $600m+ in revenue.
* Cash position of $215 million as of March 1, 2021
* 10% strategic stake in Lordstown Motor Corp (RIDE) valued at nearly $180 million as of 3/25 that became liquid April 2021. Additionally, Workhorse will receive a royalty fee for each electric pickup truck delivered by Lordstown. (Should they actually make one.)
* The global Electric Vehicles Market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 22% from 2019 to 2026”.  Per FACTS & FACTORS
* ARK forecasts that EV sales should increase roughly 20-fold from \~2.2 million in 2020 to 40 million units in 2025
* ARK estimates that at some point during the next five years, drones will deliver more than 20% of parcel shipments.
* ARK believes that drone delivery platforms will generate roughly $275 billion in delivery revenues, $50 billion in hardware sales, and $12 billion in mapping revenue by 2030.

**Who’s In(vested)?**

Institutional Ownership: 45.81% (Yahoo)

* Blackrock (6.05%)
* Vanguard (4.29%)
* Ark Invest (3.24%) \*\*\* Yes Timmy, I know they unloaded their shares.
* Robeco (3.22%)
* Invesco (2.38%)

## Comps

It is Workhorse’s expectation that the non-traditional OEMs will compete head-to-head with the likes of GM, Daimler and Ford in the sub 600 cubic feet class, while the 650 - 1200 cubic feet cargo capacity space is left largely ignored. The main reason being that vehicles over 10000 lbs require a Professional driver and costs associated with increase in skill required.

Workhorse is focused in BOTH the 650-1200 cubic feet range AND 10000lb+ gvw class.

I found that information **hidden away in a scroll called a ""10-k""**

&#x200B;

* Traditional OEMs
   * Ford eTransit/GM EV600 both have 600 cubic feet cargo capacity or less. Late 2021 production.
   * Freightliner has both the ECascadia (class 8) and eM2 (class 6-7)
   * Mercedez-Benz ESprinter (Only 96 mile charge; Looking for 100+ in North America. Although Mercedez partnered with Matternet for drone optimization, the WKHS’s US patent should impair operations.)
* Non-Traditional OEMs
   * Rivian (Amazon contract; 10,000 pounds or less)
   * Chanje v8100 (650 cubic feet cargo capacity)
   * Bollinger Deliver-E (Production set to begin 2022; no blue chip names announced)

## SWOT Analysis

* Strengths
   * Patents/Trademarks
   * All electric OEM (made in America)
   * Strong congressional support in OH
   * Already have actual product
* Weaknesses
   * Historically poor production (prior management)
   * Low staff count (during COVID they didn’t have enough staff to assemble vehicles despite backlog of thousands of vehicles)
   * Connection to Steve Burns
* Opportunities
   * Expected CAGR of both EVs and Drones over the next decade
   * 10% equity stake in RIDE (+ royalties on any future sales if they occur)
* Threats
   * Never mass produced all electric C1000 or C650
   * EV market does not rapidly expand
   * Not a cash-positive company from direct operations

## Conclusion + Position

* My Position: 850 shares @ $13.89 average cost per share/$12.30 ""adjusted"" cost basis after selling covered calls Feb-April (message for screenshot if necessary; no problem!)
* I originally discovered Workhorse digging through daily ARK invest movement emails. I found it interesting to see Cathie grabbing extraordinary amounts of shares in the company so I looked further into them. I was disappointed to see them exit their position but I have added an additional 200 shares to my portfolio since I found out.
* Workhorse was probably way ahead of itself when it reached $40. That doesn't make it ""Deadhorse"" just because it missed out on one government contract. The government will need electrified fleets; Workhorse might stand a chance, who knows.
* I miss flying my drone. I crashed it into a darn tree and ever since videos of the Horsefly on youtube have had to fill the void. Not the same, but it's like watching an airplane play Tetris.
* I did not provide a list of catalysts - use the google machine

## Exit Strategy

* No.

2021-06-15 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Q&A notes from recent Q&A w/ CEO of Fubo Q&A was with the CEO of FuboTV, a leading OTT sports streaming service with +85 live channels of sports-focused programming.

* **Company fundamentals:** FUBO has 35k+ SVOD assets and 50k+ live events including the largest football package in the US (NFL & NCAA) and the highest number of regional sports networks in the US. Key drivers for growth include: 1) secular decline of traditional TV 2) shift of advertising dollars from traditional TV to connected devices 3) online wagering / betting 4) FUBO is a young company (founded 2015) compared to peers such as NFLX / ROKU (25 years old) and KPIs are growing at triple digit rates.
* **Subscriber metrics:** Total subscriber count for vMVPDs is \~11mm households vs \~73mm traditional paid TV households. Over the next 10 years the executive expects the secular decline of traditional TV will continue and for the subscriber count to drop to as few as \~25mm households. He expects vMVPDs to capture a significant amount of these traditional TV cord cutters as “subscription fatigue” sets in for SVOD and AVOD services – this will become especially prominent as monthly sub prices increase (e.g Disney+ increased $1/month in Mar’21). He anticipates 2026 (\~4-5 years from now) will be an inflection point where vMVPDs will become larger than traditional cable services. The executive highlighted that FUBO’s sub count typically declines going into Q1 but picks up significantly in Q3 & Q4 as fans become re-engaged with football season – in Q3’20, FUBO added \~165k subs, Hulu 700k, YouTube 500k, Sling 200k. 
* **vMVPDs vs SVOD:** The executive identified headwinds for SVOD services which will likely limit their long-term growth, requiring them to more widely distribute content on other services including vMVPDs. These are: 1) for SVOD services (excl. NFLX), the cost associated with producing content coupled with the low hit rate of shows is too capital intensive to limit content to their own platforms 2) as the growth in SVOD sub counts slows their profits will decrease but production costs will remain the same or increase. In addition, long-term, the executive expects more simulcast on cable + vMVPDs in order for the cable companies to maximize the value of their content. The need to distribute content on vMVPDs will “spark a second wave of growth on the vMVPD side”. 
* **Betting / Wagering:** The executive remains highly optimistic on FUBO’s entrance into sports betting due to:  1) FUBO has brand awareness within sports and enormous sports content – “I do not see why we could not get to 5% of the betting market” which is a $70bn market 2) Vigtory acquisition – the asset is a fully functioning sports book that FUBO has continued to build upon and improve 3) state licenses – FUBO secured 3 licenses in Q1’21 (IA, IN, NJ) and could launch in \~80% of markets by the end of 2022 if needed 4) competition – FUBO’s core vMVPD competitors are giants such as GOOGL / YouTube, DKNG and other pure betting companies are much smaller 5) upward trend in vMVPDs gaining sports betting share – vMVPDs had 2.8% of the market in 2019 → \~5.5% today. Long-term, FUBO’s betting platform will have key competitive advantages which include: 1) authenticating the video user with the betting app – FUBO will have the betslip open directly to the game being watched on TV vs opening an app and having to find the correct game 2) prop betting – FUBO has engaged users watching live games which opens up more opportunities within prop betting vs competitors (e.g. if a user loves field goals, FUBO will bring up a quad view of 4 NFL games all close to having a field goal attempted).
* **ARPU:** FUBO started at $6.99/month in 2015 → $61.00/month today. He attributes the 10x ARPU increase to: 1) strong product / platform 2) targeting customers who understand the value of FUBO’s bundle – \~40yo males 3) branding – FUBO has 10-15% more sports content than competitors 4) value-added functions such as 4k, quad view, calendar view for sporting events, etc…
* **Price inflation:** FUBO dropped churn in Q3’21 despite raising prices and continues to see q/q growth. Peers such as Sling and DIS saw lackluster sub growth in Q4 & Q1 and highlighted the headwinds they are facing were based on price increases. Long-term, the executive believes FUBO will continue to be more shielded from price inflation vs peers due to: 1) 95% of FUBO’s users are sports fans – if only 30% of consumers who have cable watch sports, a price increase due to sports programming will isolate the other 70% of the audience 2) adding wagering, which is at a 50% gross margin, will be another revenue stream to handle price inflation 3) media companies who are paying 60-100% more for broadcasting rights will pass this on to users which will shrink their audience and decreasing advertising revenue → they will need to distribute further to make up for this lost revenue so vMVPDs will benefit.

**Direct Q&A:**

* **There have been customer complaints about uneven video quality on FuboTV, can he discuss this? A:** “Because we control our own video coding and delivery, there was a point in 2019 where we were 12 or 13 seconds from the edge and there is a FCC broadcast rule which requires a delay of 9 seconds in case of emergencies. We found people cared more about the quality of the video rather than the lag. We could always change it back whenever we want but for now we still find customers continue to care more about the quality”.
* **Explain the Net present value of a subscriber of a traditional cable sub vs a virtual cable sub? A: “**The number of attachments sold was 1.23mm in March 2021. With 129 hours of viewership, we will continue to be able to improve our ability to sell more attachments. Right now we are at about $840 of revenue on a run rate basis and we will probably hit \~$2k long-term including wagering and any additional attachments we would be selling. It would also include commerce – we added a button on videos which leads consumers to a commerce platform if clicked so it is like a “mini Amazon ecosystem” where sports and betting are the hook. 
* **Outside of soccer and possibly gambling, what exclusive content does Fubo have? A:** “I believe content should be fully distributed in order to be fully monetized. In terms of what we have today - de facto exclusive - is all NY hockey, the Knicks, all Boston local sports with the Bruins / Red Sox / Patriots / Celtics, Chicago Cubs, Pittsburgh Penguins and Pirates, the Houston Astros and Rockets, and Pac-12 teams”.
* **In the shorter-term, can Fubo become a greater aggregator of content where they bundle OTT streaming services and integrate them for on-demand viewing? A:** “It is certainly possible but not rational. The entertainment piece is important because it drives usage and stickiness. Sports-only is basically about PPV and the churn rate is \~35%. Even with this churn the service still showed value because these consumers signed up, had a great experience, rated 5 stars, and dropped after their team lost in the playoffs – they got what they wanted. Entertainment allows us to improve our retention because it is an expensive product so it is important to have the consumers come to our platform consistently. That is reflected in our churn numbers in which we have had 8 quarters of sequential churn decline”.
* **Most smart TVs are fairly limited in the number of buttons on the remotes, how do you approach this from a UI/UX perspective when competing against phone-based sports betting apps? A:** “As long as you have anything with a pointer and arrows you will be fine. You’ll see it on Roku in the next 5 weeks or so when we are launching our free-to-play predictive games. Apple will be different – we are not planning on launching them soon because it is a more robust platform so we will do more with it”."

2021-06-14 21:23:38,wallstreetbets,I  was thinking with that kind of volume the price would go a bit higher. It was kind of fighting for its life at $11 today lol

2021-06-15 04:39:22,wallstreetbets,Hell no lol. I used to sell on wish several years ago. It’s filled with sellers in China who get basically free shipping via postal service that takes months to arrive. Only thing I like is the easy refunds. It’s not a site people take serious. People who have experience buying off wish don’t buy shit off wish anymore
2021-06-14 21:59:21,wallstreetbets,Why would you pay $15/share for a stock that you can buy for much cheaper
2021-06-14 22:03:42,wallstreetbets,Obviously so we don’t feel like we lost money. Makes me think of the Austin Powers scene where he plays blackjack.

However, shipping times are trash. I'm not thinking of the average consumer as bad as that may sound but instead dropsellers and wholesalers. The average consumer doesnt buy off Alibaba either but through a reseller imo so I'd think it could realistically test 1/3 of Alibaba imo"

2021-06-15 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"CRSR DD What's a fair price? (look into valuation and growth) I have been long CRSR since around mid-march. I was long shares and selling cash-secured puts at the 30 dollar strike. I was looking to add some leaps when suddenly this weekend CRSR began trending on WSB and of course, on Monday CRSR opens up over 30%+ and option prices and jacked sky-high for the time being due to the volatility spike. This made me think about diving back into CRSR to see if I would be a buyer at the current prices as I was a buyer in the low 30s.

Let's dive into the numbers!

**Basic Company Stats (as of market close 6/14/2021)**

Market Cap: 3.319 Billion 

Shares Outstanding: 92.19 Million 

2020 EPS: 1.60 

P/E Ratio: 22.5 

Forward P/E Ratio: 19.8

Solid looking numbers so far P/E is pretty good, especially with Corsair's growth potential.

**Revenue Growth and Earnings Growth**

&#x200B;

[Revenue 2016-2020](https://preview.redd.it/eiuecrxghb571.png?width=769&format=png&auto=webp&s=857b993dbd9cfc076548679ce448bee0f976bbf4)

First, let's look at the revenue growth over the last five years. We can see total revenues have increased from 595 million in 2016 to over 1.7 billion in 2020 and these numbers are expected to continue to go up. 

From these numbers, we get an annual growth rate of 23%. This means revenues are growing at a pretty good rate, but before we go on we need to look at the consistency of this growth so we can better estimate future growth. We can see from 2019 to 2020 is a massive jump with a 55% jump in revenue. We can account for this massive jump to the pandemic and the historic demand for PC hardware and peripherals as well as big rises in streaming gear.

Now the hardest part of investing is seeing this 55% growth and realizing that that kind of growth will not continue. **This does not mean I do not think CRSR will keep growing it just means I do not think it will continue to grow 55% a year**. I think a more reasonable estimate would be 15-20% which is still fantastic growth. I also think with the current demand in the PC market Corsair will be able to benefit by raising prices and improving profit margins. I also think the growth in PC gaming and streaming will only continue to increase also benefiting Corsair. 

Now, let's take a quick look into earnings growth. 

&#x200B;

[Net income 2016-2020](https://preview.redd.it/aci3ochzjb571.png?width=760&format=png&auto=webp&s=316247d49a03387ddf01af6cc3db21521f59b80d)

&#x200B;

[Gross Profits 2016-2020](https://preview.redd.it/3xny5aa7kb571.png?width=767&format=png&auto=webp&s=8266fcb01edbc1d86e636dd2a32d48923d149857)

Not much to say here that has not already been said for revenue. The dramatic growth of the last year which I don't think we will see again but good growth for the future especially as they grow and are able to better manage operating costs allowing them to take in more income to the company.

&#x200B;

**Balance Sheet**

Let's skim through their balance sheet to look at what we have under the hood at Corsair.

&#x200B;

[Current Assets and Total Assets](https://preview.redd.it/omsdkh9pkb571.png?width=709&format=png&auto=webp&s=9843f73606c51edfae6679b9d2f8d6206e24a49f)

&#x200B;

[Current Liabilities and Total Liabilities ](https://preview.redd.it/d6wuo0kskb571.png?width=707&format=png&auto=webp&s=a3ceec127015477f606b8e51eced3e1b3340d077)

No shocker here their balance sheet is in great shape. They have more current assets (which is liquid assets) than current liabilities meaning if they needed to pay off all their short-term debt and other short-term ""bills"" they could cover it with the cash they have on hand. Great! They also have more total assets than total liabilities another good sign.

&#x200B;

**Cash Flow Statement**

Now the cash flow statement is what I will be using to make some attempt at valuing the company. So let's take a look.

Because they have just recently gone public I will be using the cash flow numbers from the last five quarters to determine cash flow metrics. I will be calculating free cash flow from the quarterly reports which is Cash From Operations-Capex (Capital Expenditures).

&#x200B;

[Calculated Free Cash Flow](https://preview.redd.it/8m1cvg9rlb571.png?width=769&format=png&auto=webp&s=bc56d526a0148315a06846a4f32ddf2b472f85cc)

Why is free cash flow important? This is the cash that can be used to pay down debt, buy back shares, make acquisitions, and pay dividends. 

For the last four quarters, CRSR generated 181 million in free cash flow. Now how can we use this to value the company? First, we want to see if free cash flow is growing and it is. A good thing about Corsair right now is that its CAPEX growth has remained fairly low compared to Cash From Operations Growth which I think will continue into the future. Now we just need to determine what multiple of free cash flow would be fair to multiply by?

The average S&P 500 company is around 15.

So if we multiply that to CRSR Free cash flow of 181 million by 15 we get a market cap of 2.715 billion. This would give CRSR a fair value of 29.45 dollars per share.

Now, why do I think this is too low. For one CRSR is a fast-growing company and is still fairly small compared to many S&P Companies. Also I think given its balance sheet and great financial health we should pay a premium for that.

If we compare it to a company like Logitech (LOGI), which is also coming off a massive year, Logitech currently trades around a 17 for a price to free cash flow. I think CRSR deserves around a 20-25 multiple. Why higher than Logitech? well, there are a few reasons.

1. Logitech is a 21 billion dollar company (compared to Corsairs 3.3 billion) meaning Corsair has more room to grow.
2. Logitech currently has great numbers Year of year but I don't think can grow as fast a Corsair down the road. Logitech benefitted greatly from people who were stuck at home for the first time and needs some cheap gear to do work and connect with others. Not many 50-year-old office employees are gonna go for a 200 dollar corsair RGB keyboard. I think this helps Logitech in the short run but Corsair is going to have better growth from both gaming and streaming both of which will stay in high demand after the pandemic.
3. Corsair currently has a great brand image and is known to have quality products. They are also the go-to brand for high-end gear which they can pull off some INSANE margins on.

Taking this into account what can we value Corsair at?

Based on a 20 Price to free cash flow multiple, we get a market cap of 3.62 billion, and Based on a 25 Price to free cash flow multiple, we get a market cap of 4.525 billion.

This puts CRSR's fair value, **IN MY NON-FINANCIAL ADVISOR OPINION,** in the range of **39.3-49.13 dollars per share**. Now I think you can see why I was loving Corsair in the low 30s!

I think depending on the momentum of the stock anything in the high 30s is a decent entry and the low 30s is a steal! If you are just buying Corsair for the current volatility best of luck to you. 

For anyone who wants to long CRSR right now. I think buying shares is the best right now while waiting for volatility to calm down to purchase long-term options.

&#x200B;

**Conclusion**

Corsair is a great company. It has strong financials and a great balance sheet. Fair value (currently) is in the range of **39.3-49.13** dollars per share. Remember this fair value is only for the current number and you need to continue to read over the future earnings reports to determine if the fair value should be changed. 

I think the fair value will continue to rise as long as CRSR continues to post great earnings.

Thank you all for reading and best of luck this week!"

2021-06-14 20:55:20,wallstreetbets,"FWIW, no DD here, but I futzed around looking at corsair comps to other companies with similar product lines, expected expansion & co-ops, etc. back in Dec/Jan... long story short I see them as a long-term play with a 2-3 year bump into the 60-70 range, possibly 80 if the silicon shortage gets handled faster than expected, and I put them at 40-45 by the end of 2021.

That's all assuming they just 'keep doing the same thing they've been doing'."

I have little doubt that CRSR in 5 years time will be around $80 in the worst case, above $120 if they keep executing extraordinarily well.

That's judging from what I can see now. With a rapidly growing gaming- und streaming sector as well and judging by how well run CRSR is, I wouldn't even be surprised if they reached a Logitech-like fair valuation (which would represent a share price of around $200 or an upside of around 550%) in 5-7 years."

2021-06-15 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Bezos, Cow Farts, and You: How $AMZN's deal w/ $CLNE is the most confusing in at least 30 seconds; unwinding it so people will stop being so ignorant about it. Hello, ""Apes"".  it is I...also....ape.  Yes, ape.  Here to bless you with lots of rocket emojis and bananas as I am clearly one of you.  Or something.  We still say on fleek, right? I mean, I totally know, but I'm not sure if you, too, are...you know, fellow ape....

&#x200B;

Hmm, it seems as though my emoji keyboard has been replaced with a regular Boomer keyboard.  This makes fellow ape very angry, and I will certainly go out in seek of a real keyboard after this, ape honor.

&#x200B;

Anyhow, I've seen an enormous amount of confusion from the, you know, ""non-apes"", about what $CLNE's contract with $AMZN is.  So this will all be review to you because you guys CLEARLY are savvy and intelligent investors who don't get led by the nose by bots, but for the non-apes, this will be good information.  So let's talk about it:

&#x200B;

# What's the deal:

&#x200B;

In late April, $CLNE entered into an agreement with $AMZN to provide their carbon-negative RNG fuel to $AMZN trucks nationwide.  This deal called for $CLNE to construct an additional 19 Clean Energy fueling stations in addition to the 27 stations $CLNE had astutely built right next to $AMZN's warehouse as part of the long game to get out of the friend zone with them.  In exchange for this consideration, $AMZN will be buying a fleet of RNG capable vehicles and purchasing, at a minimum to complete the arrangement, over 200 million gallons of RNG as part of their goal to become carbon neutral by 2025 - and as the most green fuel in the world, RNG represents a big chunk of being able to fudge some carbon footprint in other areas by overcompensating in fuel.  To make this deal attractive to Bezos, ape-in-training Andrew Littlefair worked a deal to issue up to 53,141,755 shares of $CLNE stock via warrants at a cost basis of $13.49,  to be executed at various gates over the next 10 years.  That represents about 27% of the company.  But you smart and intellectual apes already knew that.  I mean, obviously.

&#x200B;

The first 13,283,445 shares are fully vested upon the execution of the agreement and an affirmative vote by the shareholders, many of which are you apes because you were so smart as to buy $CLNE without having to be beaten over the head with picking a decent company for once.  That happened today.  The remaining 39,858,310 are only able to be executed by Amazon if they buy fuel - a lot of it.  Half a billion dollars of it by today's value, which most people estimate will be worth 1.5 billion over the next 10 years as prices rise.   Again, you smart apes already knew this and know that, with a present market cap of only 2.23 billion dollars, this 1.5 billion represents almost the entire value of the company as it sits today.  I don't know why I keep telling you things you clearly already know.  It must be because I am not a smart ape like you.  Amazon, of course, only signed this deal because they figure that 13.49 they'll pay per share is a bargain compared to what the company will be worth as they stepdaughter swap $CLNE out to all their buddies for corporate porn.

&#x200B;

# Now, the part the less intelligent ""non-apes"" don't seem to grasp, but the most important part:

&#x200B;

Less discussed is the fact that $AMZN, under terms of the deal, will never be permitted to own more than 5% of the company at any given point.  If they ever go over, they've got to give up some shares of the company.  This is the most important part of that entire deal, and it's the part most people don't seem to understand or one they disregard as irrelevant.  Basically, no more situations like CLNE is in with $TOT right now where that company owned 20% of $CLNE at one-fucking-penny per share, and has been fucking the stock price for almost 2 months as they de-leveraged with their 800 baggers.  Obviously, $AMZN is going to want more than the $13.49 a share they're paying, which means it's in their best interests to see to it that $CLNE is worth as much as possible.  Which very likely means buying more fuel than required as well as ""gently nudging"" their distribution partners to go RNG, as well.  And by gently nudging, obviously I mean ""waterboarding until they comply"".  You're already starting to see some of the results of this, with a deal being worked out between $UPS and $CLNE, completely of their own free will of course, to partner up for RNG contracts.

&#x200B;

# Why does any of this matter?

&#x200B;

Again, all you apes that are clearly more smart than me, ""fellow ape"", but clearly not as clever as the ape collective, you know this, but it's this:  If $AMZN's ""win"" in this deal is acquisition of diluted shares which they will not be able to actually keep, then in order for $AMZN to ""win"", they have to be able to sell those shares for more than $13.49 as they keep at their 5% ownership ceiling.  The floor on $CLNE's price should not be 13.49 because that's what $AMZN is paying, that's wrong, and everybody who's been saying that has had it backwards.  The floor should be 13.49 because that's what $AMZN's cost basis for compulsory  SELLING is.  And I guarantee you $AMZN didn't agree to pay $13.49 a share on top of 3-something a gallon for cow farts to break even or lose money.  Confusing, I know.  I mean, my 6 year old would probably figure it out if she had an extra chromosome, but I failed as a genetic donor and she only has the standard 46.

&#x200B;

So there the ""non apes"" have it, because I know all you real apes not only already had this figured out, but definitely didn't get suckered into buying $WOOF because a botnet told you to today or paperhanded shares in $CLNE when it dipped 10 cents rather than shooting straight up during the investor meeting after all the non-apes got distracted and FOMO'd into some losses and started creating confusion about what this $AMZN deal actually was by displaying they didn't understand it.  Damn non-apes, am I right, um...fellow...ape?

&#x200B;

TL:DR:  Bezos is smart ape.  And you are clearly smart ape.  Smart apes hang out with each other.  This is just like being Bezos.  Except better than Bezos, because you smart apes can keep buying more shares.  Poor Jeff can't.  Jeff's not as wise an ape as a WSB ape.

Fear and Loathing,

Seriously though, it seems like CLNE will be in a spot in the very near future (if they aren’t there already) that they basically sell every drop of RNG they can possibly produce. Everybody wants it for those sweet carbon offsets and CLNE is one of the big boys in the industry. I think RNG is gonna have a parabolic type of adoption curve in the next 5-10 years while other companies try to figure out more electric stuff (solid state batteries, cleaner lithium mining, etc.)."

2021-06-14 22:49:03,wallstreetbets,I have been into CLNE for a while. I honestly didn't read any of the post. CLNE is a well run company that seems to be cornering the entire RNG market. They are also massively shorted @ $13 June 18th. Great long and short term play. Especially if it hits anything about $13 by the end of market on the 18th.
2021-06-14 20:52:49,wallstreetbets,So what PT do you have for this by the end of 2022 if Amazon does start forcing other corporations to use RNG?
2021-06-14 20:57:57,wallstreetbets,Looks like I need to pick up some more. I only have 100 shares

2021-06-15 04:20:55,wallstreetbets,"Most of the news lately tried to demolish the bull thesis saying that Total is unloading shares heavily... On seeking Alpha they also wrote a wrong headline saying that Total sold 10 million share, while the count as of 08/06 should be 6.4 million.  


Total needs to [finance the JV](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210304005231/en/Clean-Energy-and-Total-Sign-Joint-Venture-to-Develop-Carbon-Negative-Fuel-and-Infrastructure) with $CLNE, whose budget can be considered expensive for an oil major too:

  
*""The initial firm commitment is $100 million and can increase to $400 million as development opportunities progress. Since Clean Energy and Total will be providing the equity portion of the investments, the actual amount of capital invested in RNG projects may be higher than $400 million depending on the amount of leverage that is deployed. In addition, Total will be providing credit support for Clean Energy development in the RNG value chain, including $45 million for contracted RNG fueling infrastructure.""*

Why cash is so important for RNG projects? It is important because in order to win the assignation of RNG projects (whose scale is increasing over time) you need to be the highest bidder. Many are competing to get these lucrative projects (Chevron, $ENB, single small companies previously active only in the ethanol segments)

What $CLNE has that others have not is the distribution network...and look what Chevron is doing: [Chevron brands its first CNG retail site](https://www.chevron.com/stories/chevron-brands-its-first-cng-retail-site) *""Chevron U.S.A. Inc. announced the Allied Clean Fuels Plaza retail station in Napa, California, has been rebranded as its first Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) site.

2021-06-15 00:50:42,wallstreetbets,"we got AMAZON hell bent on making sure CLNE moons, and you paper hand bitches are happy with crumbs?!?"
2021-06-15 00:55:49,wallstreetbets,I feel like as long as I'm paying less than bezos at $13.49 I'm doing okay
2021-06-15 01:29:48,wallstreetbets,"Im buying $1,200 worth of shares of $CLNE

2021-06-15 02:15:08,wallstreetbets,"if the amazing company is in, i am in. buying another 1000 shares at market open."
2021-06-15 04:16:01,wallstreetbets,"whatever happens with Amazon (which is clearly good news) $CLNE is an up and coming green sector company which has a real edge over the EV truck manufacturers - the CLNE product works - current trucks can be easily retrofitted for RNG, RNG refueling takes minutes compared to hours to recharge an EV truck, EV batteries weigh too much to be viable in long distance lorries hauling large loads and take up too much space, the green sector will be THE sector over the next 10-20 years"
2021-06-15 05:19:31,wallstreetbets,"Congratulations, I guess, on this post getting published on BZ Newswire."
2021-06-15 06:00:23,wallstreetbets,THE GODFATHER OF CLNE
2021-06-15 06:31:32,wallstreetbets,"Awesome wrote up. $CLNE team strong.

It's nice to invest in a company with a future."
2021-06-15 07:14:54,wallstreetbets,Can cow fart fuel really get us to the moon? Fuck it I’m buying 100 just in case 🤷‍♂️
2021-06-15 11:19:39,wallstreetbets,New ape... 20 shares @ 11.36 on cow farts. Fuck it 🚀
2021-06-14 20:12:39,wallstreetbets,"Thank you for the clarification, daddy ape :0"
2021-06-14 21:00:47,wallstreetbets,"While i certainly agree with the DD and will buy more CLNE in the morning, I'm not sure the floor for Amazon matters. Sure they want to sell the securities for more than their cost, but if they don't it's a tax write off, and the greenwashing campaign is where the real value is for Amazon. Not saying they want to sell at $7 a share, but the benefit they receive from Carbon-Neutral greenwashing is worth a loss for them. 

Nevermind, $30 EOW 🚀🌙🚀🌙🛸🧨"
2021-06-14 20:59:51,wallstreetbets,Music to my ears
2021-06-14 21:36:59,wallstreetbets,"Time to add even more, sigh"
2021-06-14 21:39:10,wallstreetbets,So I should buy CLNE because Bezos invested in it and he has to get a return on investment so the stock is bound to go up?
2021-06-14 21:45:21,wallstreetbets,"Dad,
Thanks for setting me straight. I'm knee deep in cow fart fueled unripened green nanners now."
2021-06-15 01:20:40,wallstreetbets,TLDR: BUY CLNE
2021-06-15 01:35:58,wallstreetbets,Holding my CLNE
2021-06-15 02:35:45,wallstreetbets,I got in at $3 a share back in November.  Thrilled to see what is going on.
2021-06-15 03:59:55,wallstreetbets,Sounds like it can't go tits up. I'm going all in
2021-06-15 06:57:58,wallstreetbets,"I never bandwagon meme stocks, but I almost understand this one."
2021-06-15 10:31:23,wallstreetbets,CLNE is at a discount people
2021-06-15 10:41:53,wallstreetbets,So... CLNE 🚀?
2021-06-15 11:16:59,wallstreetbets,CLNE wants to break out so badly
2021-06-15 11:31:39,wallstreetbets,Sooooooo basically I should YOLO CLNE.
2021-06-15 11:57:19,wallstreetbets,CLNE is being shorted. We win if they cover their positions. Easy dub for CLNE gang if we just buy and hold
2021-06-15 13:25:25,wallstreetbets,2.5k upvotes. Damn.
2021-06-15 18:42:46,wallstreetbets,"Wait.

We have the opportunity to buy shares in a company for less than what Amazon is going to pay for them?

And in addition to that, they are going to be bag-holding 20% of the company at 13.49?

So basically, they're going to want to pump the stock up with any legal means possible so they can go to the moon too?

I'm going to see if I can re-balance my account and buy more tomorrow.."
2021-06-14 22:10:35,wallstreetbets,I’ve disowned my dad. I’m making you my new father. Thank you dad 🙏
2021-06-14 22:11:33,wallstreetbets,Hey- to clarify…. Amazon is required to purchase fuel?
2021-06-14 22:30:02,wallstreetbets,"I, a smart ape, shall buy more CLNE! I'm not a common ape, for sure!"
2021-06-14 22:34:35,wallstreetbets,"Tbh I'm very new to the whole betting and stock market. Joined here last week or so. I messed up on Clov having bought some at $22🤣🤣. I do however have 70 shares of CLNE at $11.34, so it is actually good to know about how the company is gonna progress. Thanks for your post 🙏🙏"
2021-06-14 23:19:46,wallstreetbets,I heard spend the rest of my BP on CLNE first thing in the morning. Dammit I had to wait since last Monday to deposit more and I already blew through most of my cash on hand. This shit is highly addictive. I don’t even want to know how to get level two trading access. Shares have been good to me. Shares only go up.
2021-06-14 23:23:34,wallstreetbets,Okay you’ve convinced me - but maybe it’s coz I’m an ape too !

2021-06-14 23:46:55,wallstreetbets,Hey I made 2.5x on the doggy stock and got out. But thanks for fleshing out the deal. I definitely had the cost basis for AMZN figured wrong.
2021-06-15 01:19:29,wallstreetbets,I am fucking holding 1000. Time to buy more.
2021-06-15 05:11:06,wallstreetbets,I bought weekly and monthly calls for $CLNE Im also holding shares.
2021-06-15 11:02:52,wallstreetbets,I am newbie ape and bought my first 13 shares with the little money I have because you convinced me. Just hope it works out in the end. Ape worried.
2021-06-14 20:39:06,wallstreetbets,Thank you for bringing the facts (and the heat). Let’s bring this home 🚀

2021-06-14 21:40:49,wallstreetbets,Jeffs just another trust fund man child gone too far. I always wanted a reality show that challenges people like Bezos to survive four months starting with nothing.

2021-06-15 00:11:27,wallstreetbets,Glad I rolled up those couple of 6/18 $12 CCs. Shits about to get really real pre market. Can the paper handed apes be overtaken after breakfast?
2021-06-15 00:13:40,wallstreetbets,"Nrd, any insight into the massive short attack last week? Seems like they’re fighting super hard to keep this under 13 this week for obvious reasons."
2021-06-15 00:51:11,wallstreetbets,Make a post about your positions for the young apes here. Gotta attract the apes with bananas so they can buy and actually hold.

2021-06-15 08:13:13,wallstreetbets,">Obviously, $AMZN is going to want more than the $13.49 a share they're paying, which means it's in their best interests to see to it that $CLNE is worth as much as possible. 

Same thing they did with $AAWW.  Warrants (39.9% of shares across 3 tranches).  It benefits them to see the shares appreciate.  The $AAWW (and $ATSG) deal gives AMZN a board seat, I didn't see if the CLNE deal did, does anyone know?

>but definitely didn't get suckered into buying $WOOF because a botnet told you to

You mistyped $CRSR. I particularly enjoyed the 5 year old dormant accounts suddenly coming to life and spamming the board the past few days.  Right when a minimum account age went into effect here.  I guess those ~~bots~~ apes really love $CRSR"

2021-06-14 22:04:03,wallstreetbets,What is the deal with TOT? I haven’t heard about that.
2021-06-14 22:38:23,wallstreetbets,"Lol. Weird that the CLNE expert doesn’t know how to read an 8-K. Says THE MOST IMPORTANT PART is AMZN can’t own more than 5% of the company. This is false. 

Amazon Holdings may not exercise the Warrant to
the extent such exercise would cause Amazon Holdings to beneficially own more than 4.999% of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding
immediately after giving effect to such exercise (excluding any unvested portion of the Warrant) (the “Beneficial Ownership Limitation”).
Amazon Holdings **may, however, waive or modify the Beneficial Ownership Limitation by providing written notice to the Company sixty-one (61) days before such waiver or modification becomes effective** or immediately upon written notice to the Company to the extent the Company is subject to certain acquisition transactions pursuant to a tender or exchange offer).

**important part that Nerd didn’t have his intern read for him I guess** 

Both the exercise price and the number of Warrant Shares subject to purchase pursuant to the Warrant are subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments,
**including a requirement that in the event the Company issues, or commits to issue, any equity securities in a financing to raise capital
within six (6) months after the issuance of the Warrant, the number of Warrant Shares will be increased to a number of shares that would
represent 19.999% of the outstanding Common Stock on a fully diluted basis after giving effect to such financing.** 

A significant portion of the outstanding Common Stock is Beneficially Owned by two equityholders, each of which may have interests that differ from the Company’s other stockholders and which now or in the future may be able to influence the Company’s corporate decisions, including a change of control.
After giving effect to the issuance of the Warrant, Total Marketing Services, S.E. (“TMS”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Total, beneficially owns 20.1% of the outstanding Common Stock (excluding 7,898,021 shares of Common Stock that are the subject of a voting agreement, dated May 9, 2018, among TMS, the Company and all of the Company’s then-directors and officers), and the Warrant is currently exercisable by Amazon Holdings for Warrant Shares representing 4.999% of the outstanding Common Stock. **Subject to vesting of the Warrant and receipt of the Stockholder Approval, the Warrant will be exercisable for up to 19.999% of the outstanding Common Stock on a fully diluted basis (determined at the time of issuance of the Warrant), subject to certain anti-dilution provisions, and Amazon Holding’s beneficial ownership will initially be contractually limited to the Beneficial Ownership Limitation unless Amazon Holdings gives the Company sixty one (61) days’ notice that it is waiving such limitation**"
2021-06-14 21:50:33,wallstreetbets,"can AMZN just walk away from the deal, if it doesn't make economic sense w/ the stock below the warrant strike?"

2021-06-15 00:49:01,wallstreetbets,I am selling my CLNE first thing. Thx
2021-06-14 23:02:25,wallstreetbets,"While I'm a complete newbie on the stocks and investing side of things, I do have some expertise in low carbon alternatives. There is a huge cloud for this in the medium/long term. It's a great short term play to move towards carbon neutrality but there are far better (and cheaper) solutions on the horizon. Pretty much every diesel truck manufacturer knows the days of diesel are numbered. Cummins is throwing $1B at fuel cell development.  Even CLNE pays lip service to it on their web site talking about using their product to  make hydrogen or electricity...It's highly unlikely they'd be competitive with other technologies to make either.   


While Jeff probably won't give Elon an order for Tesla semis virtually every other truck manufacturer is also working to develop them and as soon as they reach cost parity, it's game over for diesels, it won't matter what fuel they're burning... Once they're here the switch will happen and fast... Logistics managers will sell their mothers to save 2 cents a hundred weight... At that point  RNG loses a lot of it's advantages...  While CLNE  talks about RNG being used to make electricity, unless they can undercut historically low natural gas prices and make a profit,  that's a nonstarter.  Bloomberg is already predicting as much as $35B in gas fired power plants as stranded assets by 2030 unable to compete with cheaper renewables (and that's even factoring in cheap NG)  so if they're closing who are they going to sell the RNG to to make electricity from it? Same is true for hydrogen... While today the dominant source of H2 is reforming methane unless you can undercut the H2 from electrolysis of water from surplus solar  you're going to be in the same boat.. They're probably safe for the next two years... after that... hard to tell..."

I’d just use CLNE to promote my renewable and clean energy initiatives. Fuck if CLNE does well.

2021-06-14 20:30:51,wallstreetbets,"As with all things in this world, someone has come up with a ratings system. The system is called Global Warming Potential, or GWP. Basically, the higher the number, the worse it is for the environment.  
  
  
Methane, which we're making whether we want it or not, is one of the worst at a GWP of over 31. It also lasts for about 70 years. As said, ""bad juju"".  
  
  
Capture it, turn it into RNG, and throw it into a truck? The truck is emitting simple carbon, with a GWP of 1.1. Which makes RNG the single most environmentally friendly fuel in the world today. Electricity comes in, on average, with a GWP of almost 10. Green hydrogen, which everybody thinks is the ultimate future, comes in at 5.8. And both of those fuel sources require extracting something from the earth, processing it, and then using it. Doesn't matter if it's lithium, hydrogen, coal, whatever, we're taking something that was 0 and creating a positive number. RNG is taking something that started over 30, and reduced it to 1.  
  
  
The obvious counterargument somebody will make is ""well, just stop making so much methane"". That will never happen unless we as a species stop eating meat (the jokes are all about cows, but pigs, chickens, etc. all make manure, too), we all stop going to the bathroom (doll it up however you want, but humans make manure, too, and wastewater treatment plants emit methane), and stop throwing things away (landfills produce). I mean, you can try to create laws around recycling your own shit by eating it and ceasing all consumption, but I don't think it's going to work out for you."
2021-06-14 20:37:09,wallstreetbets,"I really wish I did.  I just have no experience with what companies pay in carbon taxes, nor what a carbon tax credit is worth on an individual basis.  Just a situation where nobody I deal with professionally has to consider such things.  

But given that selling those credits is the only way $TSLA tricks people into thinking it's profitable...or can even meet payroll, my guess is they're probably significant."
2021-06-14 22:06:47,wallstreetbets,"Carbon credit mechanisms are a patchwork of state and regional regulations now. US states are moving at different paces towards different targets. Just this Thursday, Oregon’s Dept of Environmental Quality will release draft regulations for what fuel suppliers (like diesel and CNG vendors) will need to do to comply with Oregon’s carbon cap. Unless the feds step in, the value of GHG emissions reduction will be different in different places. 
On the other hand, the value of the RNG itself varies less by geography since there are national RNG brokers that connect producers with suppliers. Suppliers can purchase RNG “attributes,” so they get to claim the RNG on their balance sheet even though they don’t get the actual molecules of methane that came out of the cow. (A bit like how your power company may suggest you pay an extra 4 cents per kWh to buy electricity from a renewable source.)
EDIT to add that this patchwork of regulations can be a nightmare to interstate shippers and fuel suppliers. In a sector with already tight margins, you have to pay someone to stay on top of the regs and paperwork.  One of CLNE’s selling points (according to their marketing material) is that they provide guidance navigating those bureaucracies."
2021-06-14 20:42:34,wallstreetbets,"This information should be included in the contracts that they sign which may not be fully disclosed to the public.

Amazon Holdings may not exercise the Warrant to
the extent such exercise would cause Amazon Holdings to beneficially own more than 4.999% of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding
immediately after giving effect to such exercise (excluding any unvested portion of the Warrant) (the “Beneficial Ownership Limitation”).
Amazon Holdings may, however, waive or modify the Beneficial Ownership Limitation by providing written notice to the Company sixty-one

2021-06-14 22:22:36,wallstreetbets,"Basically he flipped the meaning of the Amazon options contract. Before people thought it was the ceiling, as soon as it hits $13.49 they exercise their warrants have have the stock. But that makes no sense because they're paying $13.49 for the stock, the warrant is essentially a non-expiring option. So the idea is to have the stock higher than that for a profit.

What DD just explained is that Amazon can't buy and hold, they want the stock to go up before they exercise the warrants. So there's more urgency to have the stock go up. Only way this could be better is if the warrants expire, adding more urgency."

&#x200B;

It's not that I think it can't.

&#x200B;

It's not even that I think it would be that hard.

&#x200B;

It's that I've long maintained when I noticed that potential pseudo-FD play that the buy-in of the apes was necessary for it to succeed.  And, frankly, attention spans are short.  It's not coincidence that when a good company that happens to have memeability starts running, all of a sudden these new accounts with low karma start spamming the shit out of tickers nobody has ever talked about before and in the span of a couple of hours, it becomes all anybody sees in the daily.  And it changes every day.  If it's not $SENS, it's $WISH or $WOOF or $WKHS or $WEN or some other incredibly questionable looking play with a really questionable investment thesis.  Tomorrow you're all going to FOMO into buying tacos, even though unless you bought before the bell this afternoon you're gonna get hit with the L because tacos isn't a good play.  And every day, the masses fall for the trap and blindly follow into the ticker of the day, creating bagholders aplenty wherever they go (who will continue trying to push their one-day-wonder stonk they got stuck with), letting big money collect their money and laugh about how they'll do it again tomorrow.

&#x200B;

Look at $CLNE's volume today.  Look how it started.  You can, without looking at anything other than $CLNE's volume, identify the EXACT moment $WOOF became the botnet darling.  Here's a hint:  It's right when $CLNE's volume fell off a cliff and started melting downwards for t he rest of the day.  Same manipulation happens every day to staunch a rising stonk, whether it's $CLNE or $CLF or $BB.  You can set your watch by it.

&#x200B;

And this is why I'll be surprised, because I don't really think the attention can be held for 4 days, especially with mostly novice investors who sell at the first sign of trouble, even in a fundamentally good stonk.  But I've been wrong before.

&#x200B;

In the meantime, I'll check for really expensive tacos in a couple of days, and note that the long-game of fracturing the sub by creating pockets of bagholders among a wide variety of stonks so that they can't bully anything and the collective might becomes ever weaker continues to be effective."

2021-06-14 23:57:30,wallstreetbets,"So let's talk about this:

&#x200B;

You say 2 years before hydrogen and electric take over.  I wish I could just link to a comment I made that shoots that to hell, but my intern already nuked it.  So I'll summarize:

&#x200B;

There's zero hydrogen infrastructure right now.  It's going to magically appear in 2 years?  Let's not even talk about the supply chain of getting the hydrogen to the refueling stations, or building the refueling stations.  Let's just talk about how it took 12 years to get most of the Keystone laid, and that's one pipe.  We're gonna lay hydrogen all over the country in 2?  It's taken $CLNE over a quarter century to build out their infrastructure.  And there's still the issue that there are a lot of problems with the tech, not the least of which (at least for commercial transport) is hauling capacity.

&#x200B;

Electric:  Tesla recently had to cancel an entire model of car because they were forced to admit that their battery technology was reaching its limits, and that the planned Super Plaid was not going to be able to perform plus was going to have almost no range.  That's a clamshell sedan loaded to the tits with batteries under your feet.  If their batteries are running into problems with that, how do you think it's going to translate to commercial transport?   Gonna stuff a 53' trailer with 8' of batteries?  Space and load weight is money, transport isn't going to go with that.  Going to stop to recharge for 4 hours every 3 hours?  Time is money, transport isn't going to go with that.  And then there's the issue of the $250-300K for the vehicle vs. a $250 retrofit on an ICE.  Money is money, transport isn't going to go with that.

It was just so obvious how, every day, a new ticker that nobody ever really talks about suddenly becomes the thing everybody talks about in a matter of a couple of hours and nobody ever questions how it is that happens.  And the ticker in question almost always has an incredibly sketchy story behind it to justify it.  $WOOF is one of the less egregious ones, but clearly nobody has taken a look at the numbers or projections."

2021-06-15 01:39:48,wallstreetbets,"The battery technology in question for the Tesla is the 2670 Cell. It wasn't a car model but a variant with low volume sales..It's a ludicrous comparison, a completely different engineering challenge.. . The semis will have 4680 cells.  The claims are 500 miles under load. We'll see when they get here... Diesel tops out at 45% efficiency... Battery at 80+% If they get 500 miles per charge they are perfect for companies like Amazon and Walmart who are likely moving the vast number of their loads DC to DC and not cross country.  


Load weight is only an issue if you're carrying heavy items...53"" trailers exist because there are a lot of high cube low weight loads... I'd venture to guess few Amazon trailers are at weight capacity...  Natural gas has been touted for years as an alternative to diesel... T Boon Pickens pushed it  as a means to eliminate oil imports 20 years ago..... It went absolutely nowhere... The only reason this is even in play now is it's an opportunity to impact carbon footprint..  At best it's going to be a bridge.... The Biden administration just announced they are revisiting tightening the standards on PM2.5 particulate pollution, something diesels, even RNG powered ones make a lot of, if they are tightened to comply with the scientific guidelines this is bound to have a negative effect on  the future of diesels...   


The thing with hydrogen for heavy transport is you don't need fueling stations everywhere. If you're making it via electrolysis you don't even need pipelines... just water and a cheap source of electricity and associated storage technology... But you'd likely see an entirely different paradigm. Either quick swap pressure tanks or even more interesting play light activated hydrides which don't even have to be pressurized.... Comparing the time $CLNE took to the size of the current investment in green hydrogen is even more laughable.. Air Products has a $5 Billion contract to build a green hydrogen plant in Saudi Arabia, One of literally dozens of projects worldwide..most of which are individually larger than the cumulative investment $CLNE has made in 25 years...  Goldman-Sachs predicts $12 trillion investment in green hydrogen by 2050 which is probably low by a factor of 2 or 3.  My point about 2 years is that's when the ride will start to be over... It will take a while to convert the fleet but it's pretty well inevitable...  


I'm guessing you were one of those who thought the internet would just be a fad because there was no infrastructure beyond 56K modems... H2 will be no different... As a short term play $CLNE is fine... don't bet your future on it...hell their own web site admits it with mentions of using it to make electricity or hydrogen... I'm sure that's lip service to their own SWOT analysis...BEV and H2 are both serious threats to their business model.  but I'd suggest if they wanted to be looking to a long term future they'd already be planning a transition to hydrogen from reforming RNG."

BlackBerry IVY – Intellectual Vehicle Data Platform

""The IVY deal has so much commercial promise. Manufacturers are going to buy IVY because of the data gathering, but more importantly IVY is going to become the universal app store for automotive apps. 

The IVY platform will be universal across manufacturers and models so a developer can build an app that will work on any car that has IVY. BB will take an app store like commission on revenue. Billions.After cars, IVY and QNX will move to the broader Internet of Things. Planes, trains, medical devices, EVERYTHING will be connected and needs to be secure. 

BB has competitive advantages over all the other players, especially Linux because it is not secure, while BB’s QNX has the highest achievable safety certs.If the automotive biz wasn’t enough they have interesting offerings in corporate data security, anti-virus, and emergency notification systems.

They are literally in some of the hottest spaces you could be right now, with no signs of cooling. As of their conferences, IVY and QNX both seem to be opening up many many more avenues of revenue to tackle within the auto space. Per Steve Rai, what was typically 2-3 avenues of revenue is not 5-6, with IVY being a HUGE 7th."""

OP's post is mostly spot-on because any of the above still contain a motivation for Amazon to see the stock price rise and stay as high above $13.49 as possible, with either an income statement motivation of profiting from the sale of shares or a balance sheet motivation of increasing the value of the equity-asset of the CLNE warrants."

It's not a ludicrous comparison, because no matter how you compress the cells of a battery, you're still limited by the underlying technology.  If it didn't matter, companies like $QS wouldn't exist to try and figure out how to address it.  Further, the ""claims"" are irrelevant, because Elon has fallen short on claims on literally every one he's ever made.  Model S range was supposed to be 400 miles.  Mine gets a little over half that - as long as I don't head into the mountains.  Model 3 pricing.  FSD capabiliities.  Municipal battery capacity and rollout.  Roofs.  Semi range (which they've already said they're angling down towards a more reasonable 300 mile claim, useless for the transport sector).  Rockets to Mars.  That ""hyperloop"" in Vegas that's really just a Tesla sedan that drives around in a tunnel like a Morloc cabbie.  On and on.  The guy's entire life has been defined by overpromising and underdelivering.

&#x200B;

You talk about load weight only being an issue in some instances, but the fact of the matter is truck purchasers want their trucks to have it and not need it rather than need it and not have it, so they have to be able to pull 80,000 pounds and maintain range.  The truck itself is going to weigh 35,000 in this configuration.  At present technology, the weight of a battery system to get a truck 600 miles would be 36,000 pounds.   Even if they aren't running full, only having 9,000 pounds of weight with an empty truck and trailer isn't going to be enticing to anybody.  To get 300 miles, you're looking at a battery weight of 18,000 pounds.  Add in the 29,000 for the truck itself, and you've only got 33,000 pounds of cargo, which is 14,000 pounds less than an ICE truck.  Maybe the weight there doesn't matter, because you've also only got 29' of trailer space.  Need a reefer configuration?  Hope you like your frozen meats cooked medium well since you've got all your heat created in the trailer itself and limited air control.  Not leaving a lot for carrying, now are you?  Further, you downplay the importance of space, which sh ows you've clearly never done anything with logistics.  It's a game of Tetris, and every inch of that 53' is attempted to be filled.  Every inch taken away is money not earned.  You just gloss over it because it's inconvenient to your argument and you've got this pie in the sky idea of a complete revolution of our entire trnasport sector that will shake the very foundation of our infrastructure to the core taking place in the next 730 days.  Then you go on to talk about nat gas as a push 20 years ago, ignoring that advances in the technology have made up the gap for the fact that the original nat gas rigs didn't have the power necessary to appeal to the industry (you know, while again completely glossing over the weight restrictions placed upon a truck carrying 18 tons of batteries).

&#x200B;

Then, of course, we go into another pie in the sky argument about setting up water treatment facilities everywhere to create the hydrogen  (not going to happen) and having mechanics on standby to hot swap fuel tanks, which is a workaround solution if I've ever heard one.  Then a completely ludicrous comparison to a mammoth facility being built in Saudi Arabia (which does not have the same infrastructure needs a country the size and scale of the US has) as though it's even salient to this conversation.  And of course, this ignores the biggest problem of all - your claim that these companies are going to pay $300,000 for a truck and another $300,000 for 18 tons of batteries a scant couple of years after paying to either retrofit or acquire new trucks that run on RNG, because these companies always depreciate their assets after a couple of years in your crazy ass scenario.  And of course, all this is ignoring the fact that you're saying these companies will pay a premium for the privilege of less infrastructure and more downtime vs. an equivalent or better solution in terms of functionality that can be refilled and have a driver back on the road in 8 minutes vs. 4 hours.  Again, supposing the giant amp infrastructure to charge batteries that size gets rolled out nationwide, as well.

&#x200B;

Your rambling about CLNE's website talking about the ability to turn RNG into hydrogen is just showing the flexibility of the fuel, not trying to make some hedge against future business models, and I think most people understand that.

&#x200B;

And then, of course, you close with a wild supposition and attempt at gaslighting with that whole ""internet"" bit, which is a great Alinsky tactic, but doesn't really work with me.  So I'll give that all the attention it deserves.  Other than to point out we're almost 30 years into consumer available internet and how much of the country is still stuck on dialup?  But sure, we're gonna build all this infrastructure in 2 years, including all the grid hardening that has to take place for a nationwide municipal grid that is well beyond end of life and already stressed.

But sure, let's go with your argument that, somehow, we're going to completely move away from ICE technology in the next couple of years even though we're 20 some years into the process and haven't even made a dent yet, and most of the technology out there isn't even prototype staging yet.  That sounds entirely doable.  I bet even 90% of the cars on the road will be electric, too.   /s.

&#x200B;

TL:DR:  Your argument is bad, and you should feel bad for presenting it."

2021-06-15 02:51:15,wallstreetbets,"Lmfao.  If you think I threw out terminology “ the average person wouldn’t understand” you have just admitted you don’t have the knowledge to make an intelligent reply. Game over.  Where can I get a tank to hold compressed natural gas for $250? Asking for a friend.  Methane is far less energy dense than diesel so you need a bigger tank too. You MIGHT convert an existing diesel but it’s unlikely you’ll replace one in 5 years time with an new one.  That has been my point all along 

You’re the poster child for bad arguments with random numbers you’ve pulled out of your a** cite your source for 18 tons of batteries. A Tesla 100kwh battery weighs 1375 pounds. You think a semi is going to have 2.6 mwh of batteries?? Really? Really?  Since you’re clearly math challenged. 18 tons is 36000 pounds. Divided by 1375 is 26.18 x 100 =2600 kWh or 2.6 mwh.  

If NG is so much better than diesel why wasn’t everything converted 40 years ago during the Arab oil embargo?  Thanks for playing you were good for a laugh.

2021-06-15 00:15:46,wallstreetbets,"The 61 days notice is because, were $AMZN to give such notice, $CLNE would immediately deploy countermeasures in anticipation of a hostile takeover, including poison pills and massive dilution to make it harder to be acquired.   Countermeasures which would make $AMZN's holdings worth appreciably less.

&#x200B;

It's not even that I wouldn't like to see $CLNE get bought out (though I think a company like $BP or $MRO would be better for that), it's just that Littlefair is one of the founders, and he's made it abundantly clear he isn't giving it up."
2021-06-15 00:01:57,wallstreetbets,"I see your point. I understand this as more of a partnership for Amazon to help CLNE build out their infrastructure (to Amazon's benefit) while creating a path for Amazon to purchase a significant portion of CLNE, lower their carbon footprint, and get $500M in fuel during the process. 

If CLNE can increase  ~$9.43/share over the $13.50 exercise price of the warrants during the life of the agreement (warrants are valid until 04/16/31), Amazon has covered the cost of the $500M in fuel purchased from CLNE."
2021-06-15 03:15:23,wallstreetbets,"Where would I get such a conversion setup if I didn't need the full 80K pounds?  Simple:  I would call $CVX or $CLNE, who will just GIVE me one.  The $250 is to install it.  Oh, you didn't know about that program?  Why am I not surprised?  You seem to have a passing knowledge of...well, not much but it's definitely passing when it's there.

&#x200B;

Where did I get my numbers for the weight of batteries?  Well, I could listen to some rando on Reddit with a username that doesn't check out (without looking at anything but these 3 posts, let me guess....mid 20's, San Francisco area?  Definitely California at the least), or I could trust the data provided in a peer reviewed study conducted by Shashank Sripad and Venka Viswanathan at CMU that was published in the American Chemical Society Letters detailing the exact physics considerations necessary for this application.  You know, 2 of the world's foremost experts on this topic?  Didn't read that one?  Sucks to be you.

&#x200B;

Hmmm, what should I pick?  Decisions, decisions.  I think I'm gonna go with the actual smart people rather than the San Francisco ideologue who couldn't overfill a thimble with his knowledge.  Call me crazy.

&#x200B;

As to your ultra retarded argument about the oil embargo of the 70's, it's because the technology hadn't caught up (or was even mildly ready) at that point.  Nat gas engines up until very recently could only muster about 1200 foot pounds of torque, and commercial transport purchasers want products that can haul the full 80,000 pounds which is important to you when convenient and to be discarded when it's not (how appropro).  The new $CMI ISX12N with the Endurant tranny is the thing that flips that all on its head.  1450 pounds of torque, 750,000 mile warranty.  All the benefits of diesel without any of the downsides.  But hey, keep thinking that in 5 years (I see we've moved on from 2), Pilot stations won't have diesel anymore because we're going to magically spend, how much did you say? 12 trillion dollars?  Just on green energy?  Right.

&#x200B;

You're dismissed."
2021-06-15 06:15:04,wallstreetbets,"I like to debate. However, if you think transition in large logistics will take 5 years for either electric or hydrogen to take over from the standard, you are highly likely to be wrong. I have my doubts they even go for something like RNG unless pressured or some shit, maybe if its very cheap. unless exceptional progress is made in electric or hydro, i cannot possible figure out how they would do this. I work in logistics and there is just no way. the margins are dogshit overall and they need to fill every nook and cranny, and they do this religiously. Also, they are autistic af. I have known 0 logistical companies that will not go for the best deal they can make for near terms. They do not deal in the future. They will drive the truck to death, and when its burried, they will consider getting a new one, at which point it will be taken into consideration what to get and what they require, and i shit you not, what the require is SPACE, nothing more nothing less. It will be space, it will always be space, and it will be to get as much goods to a place as quick as possible. IF you think they will go for some shitty ass truck that will take charge time, you are delusional. These  trucks NEVER stop driving. Think about repair cost alone, if it has any significant down time? there is literally no fknway."

2021-06-15 01:20:02,wallstreetbets,"Inflow/Outflow graph tells a different story. Retail moving to the next ""get rich quick"" stock was a small part of the story. Keep in mind the main price movement of this stock up without going back down shortly after is during premarket and after market when it's not being shorted and people have to buy/sell shares since you can't buy options during that time either.

Also what is with this idea that high volume = stock goes up? Price does not necessarily go up/down based solely on volume, yes it can help a trend but the higher the volume doesn't mean retail or anyone is making a stock go up. Shit like SNDL and castorshippennies were the highest volume traded stocks for weeks while the prices tanked.

I'm all for the feel good story of holding and making money, but I'm all for people who want to take profits even in small amounts when it could be bigger/sooner and I think ""paperhands"" get blamed for a lot of price tanking that they barely had an effect on.

I'm holding blackberry @14.65 despite seeing the graph hit 20+, I'm holding CLNE and have calls and am incredibly confident it will climb, I held GME for almost 4 months before taking profit. I got no problem with holding when I see a bigger $ in the near future, but I don't blame those who get impatient/nervous either."
2021-06-15 00:30:10,wallstreetbets,"What you're reading there is that, if some OTHER entity acquires $CLNE, $AMZN can immediately exercise all their warrants for the purposes being part of the acquisition's conversion to either cash (if privatized) or shares of the new parent company.

2021-06-15 00:33:02,wallstreetbets,"That makes some logical sense, but as with any contract if it’s not explicitly spelled out I tend to assume it’s excluded. Perhaps “certain acquisitions” are defined somewhere more clearly."

No. Like I said this isn’t new like OP’s title implies, and it’s an objectively small position.

iShares has another ETF that has a larger BB position than this, which also isn’t new.

2021-06-15 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Still looking for that short-interest play? I've aggregated a list of potential squeeze plays that have not ""squoze"" yet. Options activity included. I'm sure you all know the short-interest play is a **very high-risk, high-reward** trade. Having said that... I've aggregated a list of some potential short-interest plays that haven't popped off. If you like any of the tickers mentioned here I suggest you research if they are capable of a turn-around story (most will be shorted for a reason). The factors for the stocks that made it to today's list are:

1. Chart looks decent and the stock hasn't already gone up 50% or more (aka already missed the boat)

2. Some bullish option flow came in today and the stock price was somewhat flat or down.

3. Is short interest **increasing** or **decreasing** as the stock goes up or down? If the stock is getting hit (going down) and SI is increasing, it's quite *possible* these shorts will eventually cover their position at some point.

**The tickers list is:** WKHS, QS, OCGN, FUBO, ROOT, BGS, ROOT, SDC

Here's today's option flow and sentiment for the list of high short-interest names. 

https://preview.redd.it/r291mcwr6b571.png?width=978&format=png&auto=webp&s=ac6b85721683b9b5103daf4ca81ebf99cc985f09

&#x200B;

Keep in mind the FIRST thing I check with option flow is the expiration of the larger trades. If it's within 1 or 2 weeks I don't usually like to give it much credit. These could mean literally anything: a hedge, riding momentum, etc. I prefer seeing stuff 3-12 months out for a long-term play.

**Final Thoughts**

Some of these stocks might have popped 10-25% in the short-term, but if you zoom out to 6 months you'll see they are still down quite a bit and have been heavily shorted. If any of these were on your radar it might put into perspective the chart and level of short-interest for each ticker.

Their float is what, 5x smaller than AMC? Market cap under 2b (so room to move). The SI is through the roof. It would take relatively such little movement to send this thing off to the races. And even if it doesn’t squeeze I think it will hit 30+ just on normal short shares being returned.  It’s obviously talked about all over Reddit but not as much as it should be discussed IMO.

Like there is no reason to not include it in the discussion when tons of short squeeze indicators are going off for it."

2021-06-14 20:55:15,wallstreetbets,So buying a stock to cause a short squeeze is a legitimate investment strategy now? There's a reason why it's heavily shorted--cause it's a shitty company. So you're investing in shitty companies--that's basically what this strategy is. Stupid apes.

2021-06-15 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$PYR Plasma is the future. Very solid company poising up to blow and now it’s over $1b Alright so I posted this on Friday, but mods deleted it since it was at 990 mil market cap and they didn’t like that…. Well it’s up 12% since that post and now it’s conveniently over the 1b minimum so my post gets to stay. 

If Pyrogenesis has flown under your radar then PYR designs, develops, and manufactures advanced plasma processes and systems in Canada. They have a sustainable process for enhancing metal recovery in the metallurgical industry; plasma atomized metal powders; PUREVAP, a process to produce high purity metallurgical grade silicon and solar grade silicon from quartz. They have processes to form nanopowders and nanowires specifically for lithium batteries. PyroGenesis received a $700,000 grant from Sustainable Development Technology Canada for a novel production process to transform quartz into fumed silica using a plasma reactor, thereby reducing hazardous waste and greenhouse gas emissions in comparison to the established fumed silica production process. This month alone they have received a request for a cost estimate for thirty-six plasma torches from a major iron ore producer as well as a Letter of Intent from to purchase three 10-ton DROSRITE systems. The contract, if finalized, is expected to be in the range of $10-15 Million. Most importantly they have confirmed that the GEN3 PUREVAPTM Quartz Reduction Reactors pilot plant project is now transitioning from the assembly phase to the commissioning and testing phases for Q4 2021. This could be their largest project yet creating ONE STEP transformation of quartz to high purity silicon metal at vastly cheaper costs, energy input and most importantly carbon footprint. Insiders own close to 47% of the float leaving just about 70 million shares afloat. PYR is new and innovative in their sector developing energy and cost saving techniques while also formulating sustainable industrial practices, which is why I think they could take a huge lead in their sector. It blew past $9 back in February when the market was moving in a good direction and plummeted to $4. With such great news coming out this month for PYR I can see a quick return to where they were heading back in February."
2021-06-14 20:27:53,wallstreetbets,I bought shares in their subsidiary HPQ on the TSX. Hoping their silicon nano works out and becomes the next thing in batteries.

2021-06-14 22:19:56,wallstreetbets,"Triple digits. 3 clients for their plasma torches in the iron ore pellitization industry need ~1000 torches. It's estimated that it will cost 1.8mil for a torch, and recurring revenues will bump that number to ~3 mil. 1 business line will justify a 100+ price target alone. Now add in what PYR is doing in the additive manufacturing field, and the potential of their partnership with HPQ to provide the cheapest cost of high purity silicon for multiple applications (including the EV space), PYR is an extremely enticing investment.

Are you 100% positive ARK is invested because of PyroGenesis' NextGen Plasma Atomization process? Or maybe it's due to PyroGenesis being so multifaceted with plasma technology and the ARK PRNT etf was just any easy placement for them? To say it is ONE technology ARK is mainly interested in is misguiding and you have no proof to support that other than it being in a PRNT ETF.

TLDR;

Extremely low float \~ 18 mil

Solid Fundamentals, great company outlook if anyone even cares anymore. Annual Revenue 2.2 billion

Moderate Short Interest \~7% of float or 975k shares

Options are cheap – IV is only 54%

Low Volume \~400k

No longer just a TV company, Gross profit from Platform grew 152% yoy in Q1

Huge Omega – will not take much price movement for tendies

I was inspired by the [WWE post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nvcyxf/wwe_can_you_smell_what_the_stock_is_cooking/) in here last week, so I thought fuck it lets use his patented S.M.E.L.L system to sniff out WWE junior. For those of you who missed out on the sweet tendies from WWE last week here’s your chance to redeem yourself. Vizio is no GME or AMC, but as long as I’m getting 1000% gains mainlined to my mommy’s basement I don’t give a fuck. 

# I: Fundamentals

I know 97% of you retards don’t about fundamentals let alone even know how to spell fundamental, but for the 3% that can tie your own shoes here’s some highlights from their Q1 [results](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210511006163/en/VIZIO-HOLDING-CORP.-Reports-Q1-2021-Financial-Results): 

&#x200B;

* Net revenue increased 52% year over year to $505.7 million for Q1
* Platform+ net revenue increased 120% year over year to $52.2 million
* Gross profit increased 82% year over year to $86.7 million
* Adjusted EBITDA increased 218% year over year to $40.4 million
* SmartCast Active Accounta grew 57% year over year to 13.4 million
* SmartCast Hours grew 70% year over year to 3.6 billion
* Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) increased 76% year over year to $14.52

And here’s the part that gets me the most excited, Gross Profit from Platform is up 152% year over year. Vizio is already ranked #2 in best selling TV brand and #1 in best selling soundbars, and now they’re going to start competing in the smart TV market. The king of the smart TV Market right now is Roku, controlling a [30% market share as of Q1 2021](https://9to5google.com/2021/05/03/roku-global-streaming-marketshare-drops/#:~:text=Conviva%20reports%20(via%20Protocol)%20that,to%2030%25%20in%20Q1%202021.). The King is hurt right now, reeling from their awkward breakup with [Youtube TV](https://clark.com/streaming-tv/roku-announces-youtube-tv-breakup/). Turns out Youtube TV actually prefers Vizio’s [magnum dong](https://www.engadget.com/vizio-smart-cast-owners-no-longer-need-two-apps-for-you-tube-132131066.html#:~:text=Just%20here%20to%20drop%20a,in%20the%20next%20few%20days.). I’m willing to bet Vizio becomes a major player in the streaming market, plus they have the advantage of already being a huge TV manufacturer. Roku certainly got a head start, but we’ve seen companies blow a 3-1 lead before \*cough\* Skype. We all know streaming is the future, and the future of Vizio’s Smartcast (and by extension our tendies) right now is bright. And I’m not the only one who thinks this, As of 6/11/2021 Vizio has 7 Buy ratings and a consensus price target of $30.29. For the mathematically challenged that’s a *33.6%* upside from where the stock is now. Or put simply to any boomers skulking around, that’s 3.36 years of returns compared to your boomer index S&P fund, and I’m being fucking generous. 

# II. Catalysts

Vizio is getting into the data tracking/advertisement business as well, recently reporting that they have just surpassed [11 million addressable enabled TVs](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210609005230/en/VIZIO-Surpasses-11-Million-Addressable-Enabled-TVs) in the US. Why does this matter? It's yet another income stream for the TV manufacturing god, and one that has been insanely profitable for other companies. For those of you who live under a rock, almost all of these tech companies are competing for your data to sell to advertisers, and Vizio is finally getting into the game. We're only a few years away from lightspeed briefs ads being beamed into your dreams while you sleep, so for Vizio to start carving out a market share in this space I think is pretty significant. 

# III: Technicals

Here’s why I think VZIO can be a WWE junior.

**Extremely low float:** The float on this is around 18 million shares, which is less than half of the float on WWE. And for you AMC and GME retards, Vizio’s float is only 4% of AMC’s and less than half of GME’s. If you’re still confused let me say it this way. If everyone subscribed to wallstreetbets wanted 2 shares there wouldn’t be enough shares to go around. I’ve been sniffing around and this is the lowest float non-bullshit stocks I’ve been able to find. And by non-bullshit I mean Vizio actually has a respectable market cap and actually makes money. 

**Volume is low:** Volume is extremely low and trending lower. Average volume is only around 400k and has been trending downward ever since the IPO. 

**Options are cheap:** IV on this stock is only 54%. For reference, when CLNE popped the IV was around 80%. If there is any kind of volume spike this IV will go up considerably. It is crazy to me that the IV can be this low when the consensus price target has a 33% upside. 

**Moderate SI:** The SI is only moderate sitting at 7%, but still enough to cause some heartburn. And fuck it, it’s you know what season. With the IV so low if the shorts were forced to cover we could see some serious tendies. 

**Huge Omega:** With the IV so low it won’t take much movement for our options to print. The [Omega](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/omega.asp), or elasticity is huge. For example, when Vizio went up 3.60% last Friday June 18 2021 Calls increased 84%, or an Omega of 23.4. Plus not only is the Omega large, the options chains are fucking *scarce.* July FDs only go up to $30 strike, and if you were paying attention to the Fundamentals section that’s below their target price. 

# IV: Conclusion

This is my pick for a low-risk high reward play.  Its got everything I looked for plus the options are cheap. On the 3.6% move last Friday even my Nov 19 $25 calls went up 12%. It was fun riding the WWE tending train last week, and I think we could have a similar situation here. 

You could even play this stock like a boomer (buy and hold, can’t go tits up) and come out with some solid gains if we hit the consensus price target. I think the July 25C have a great chance of printing. I’m personally holding shares, June 18 22.5 C, July 16 25 C, and Nov 19 25 C, and if this post gains traction here I'll probably add some 25C FDs. 

Not financial advice, buy some shares and options or don’t, I don’t really give a fuck. I just like the stock and the 32"" Vizio my mommy got me for birthday so I thought I'd share this post with you degenerates. I sit in front of a computer for a living so I’m probably actually autistic."
2021-06-14 23:09:57,wallstreetbets,Gonna buy at open

2021-06-14 22:14:38,wallstreetbets,"Wow, actually solid DD! Do you think the success of VZIO would affect FUBO? I only ask cause I have a big ol bag of FUBO and it might be worth switching out once I check out the fundamentals"
2021-06-15 02:34:10,wallstreetbets,Hey! You finally got it to stick! I bought a few calls. I'll probably load up on a few more and maybe some shares in the morning! Good job OP.
2021-06-15 09:51:44,wallstreetbets,"Damnit. I’m in 7/16 25c. Already long on some stock and been performing well, thanks for DD."
2021-06-15 05:59:29,wallstreetbets,"7/16 25c looks good to me, I will be picking up some. Good DD I’ve always loved my Vizio had one for like 10 years. Them hoes indestructible 😂"
2021-06-15 06:39:09,wallstreetbets,"When you say huge omega , does take much movement for tendies, but I did a quick look and on fidelity says no options for vzio. Would be Interested in shares anyways but am I missing something.

I am familiar with there products have had plenty of there TVs work great last long and are cheap"
2021-06-15 11:55:08,wallstreetbets,"Hello, VZIO 😎

2021-06-15 17:28:14,wallstreetbets,Epic man! Solid analysis
2021-06-14 20:02:05,wallstreetbets,I believe Vizio still has a contract with Walmart? Does anyone have info on the current status of this? Tried googling..
2021-06-15 01:45:50,wallstreetbets,Im still using my 5 year old Vizio tv. Used one too ha.
2021-06-15 12:26:15,wallstreetbets,Just grabbed 20 shares. See you on the moon. 🙃😂

2021-06-14 20:36:43,wallstreetbets,"Oh, now someone has a positive DD after I sold my shares. LOL. I would bring up VZIO and would get shut down. Damn tards. There was never volume on it, it remained pretty still so I sold. Didn't wanna get caught bag holding a relatively stagnant stock (compared to my other holdings). Now watch it shoot to 30. Hahaha"
2021-06-15 13:15:30,wallstreetbets,Thanks for this.  Hope you made some money.  I got in and out for 1k in 30 mins.

2021-06-14 21:41:45,wallstreetbets,So not 25c for this week. I definitely won’t be buying them.
2021-06-15 13:58:29,wallstreetbets,"You pumped and dumped that, huh?"
2021-06-15 01:17:43,wallstreetbets,"short interest too low, cannot be meme'd"
2021-06-14 20:00:49,wallstreetbets,No they do not
2021-06-15 13:41:48,wallstreetbets,and it's gone
2021-06-14 20:45:14,wallstreetbets,Anytime is mentioned my plays that weren’t memes I’d get downvoted. I steadily add vzio shares.. it’s always been the long play for me
2021-06-14 20:33:52,wallstreetbets,"I do, yes. 

They have excellent value products that are very competitive in the marketplace.

That said, I don’t think it’s a stock that will set the world on fire anytime soon with massive gains overnight. I do like the price currently, I think this dip is a nice buying opportunity to just kind of “set it and forget it” for the long-term."
2021-06-14 20:52:23,wallstreetbets,"Set and forget is both my least favorite AND most successful strategy, so I might begrudgingly get on that"
2021-06-14 21:48:39,wallstreetbets,"Same here. TCL & Biogen (BIIB) are two of my long-term holds. Biogen did just get pretty exciting, though. I like the idea of Vizio, going to spend some time on it tomorrow.

GMGI is my moonshot, that’s the one I’m looking at to really transform my portfolio. It’s at $9 now, but I think $30, $40+ isn’t out of the question once it uplists to NASDAQ."
2021-06-14 21:49:54,wallstreetbets,What do you mean by “uplists”?
2021-06-14 22:07:22,wallstreetbets,"It is currently trading on the OTC, but once companies hit certain benchmarks they can apply to “uplist” to trade on a big exchange, like NASDAQ. 

Essentially, it’s like getting called up from AAA ball to play in the majors."

So this is one of those companies, the market loves right now. The reason the stock is down because they had a share offering. The interesting thing here is that the company offering was only 1 000 000 shares.

Celsius has 73,33M shares out. This offering was a way too big overreaction. It is a 1,4% change in shares Outstanding...

What does it tell when 74% of the stocks are held by insiders? It tells that it is a good and healthy fucking company. Only 26% of the shares is available on the market. That tells something about the trust the insiders have for this company. They wouldn't be holding it if they would see it going bearish.

Now let's look at the chart. On the dip we a 10% gap to fill on there. This same happened with $WISH. It had a gap there and it got filled. In fact 90% of these gaps get filled. Also you can see the stock making higher highs. It's at it's breakout point. I just want to share this to you. Make good trades, good luck on the market guys.

2021-06-15 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Be careful with $WOOF on Tuesday -- algos are targeting six month high retest Today's unexpected rise is exciting and we could see a few dollars more tomorrow, but not likely.

$WOOF normally trades within a single deviation but sometimes breaks off it by another deviation.

The previous high was set EXACTLY six months ago according to the chart at 31.08, seen in the image below. The algorithms are retesting the six-month high.

https://preview.redd.it/f7erxe7mwa571.png?width=895&format=png&auto=webp&s=707372ca128423886a14bc454eae4ee7c096cc24

You can see the daily chart on Monday that the high went up to the second deviation, just like six months ago. It failed it six months ago. We had 54.5 million volume on January 14. We had 42 million volume on June 14.

[Daily on Left. 4-hour on right.](https://preview.redd.it/wyue26gtva571.png?width=1878&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3f74e3685038a08f6e2a190d6663060bd7dc802)

Will it fail to break another deviation? Typically, stocks that break out will increase a single deviation, as you can see in the chart. But this also means that there's usually a pullback before it retests it.

So if you expect $WOOF to fly on Tuesday, be careful."

2021-06-14 20:05:17,wallstreetbets,It says $157k
2021-06-14 23:20:28,wallstreetbets,Fisker might be a better long play.
2021-06-14 21:50:11,wallstreetbets,"Magna will charge Fisker for the full cost of tooling up and whatever changes are being made as they go through the process to get to production. Magna is only going to take on a very small amount of risk here. Fisker will have the full brunt of R&D and so on which will result  in significant cash burn. I think you and others are simply underestimating the cost of getting to volume production and making a profit. Volkswagen for example said it is committing about $97B (Billion) to going electric. If VW expects to sell 10M vehicles a year that is 10,000 for 1 vehicle worth of capacity. So if Fisker wants to get to 100,000 vehicles produced a year, well you can figure it out. Also how much would the profit be on 100,000 vehicles, considering that Fisker's cost of production would be higher than say someone building them internally as Magna is going to want to make something on this."
2021-06-14 23:22:03,wallstreetbets,"They're (Volkswagen) also planning over 70 models so it's not a good comparison. 97 bil / 70 models = 1.38 b, about Fisker's cash reserves

I will also compare them by revenue, not profit, as that is how most car companies are calculated. (Tesla only just hit profitability and has been trading over 50b market cap for a long long time, Nio has no profitability but hit 3b in rev and is worth 60b)

Morgan Stanley compares Fisker rev today vs Tesla rev pre production and comes up with a $90 case. I won't even do that. I will do the most simple analysis.

We are obv not sure if they'll hit 100k cars but considering they have nearly 20k and haven't even shown a public display I don't think it's that unreasonable. It's also a universally agreed attractive car - I don't think hitting the reservation is too crazy.

Using Fisker's lease program:

100k reservations \* $450 (this is most likely going to be average monthly lease) \* 12 = 540m . Fisker is trading 10x future forward rev)

For comparison: Nio is trading 23x current rev, Tesla 19x current rev

Meaning if Fisker can execute, which I think it can, then it has room to double easily. I won't factor in Foxconn or anything else since I think that is too far in the future to speculate on. And yes, things can go wrong, but I don't think much will.  I'm excited for them. We'll see

Yes their margins will be effected by working with Magna but so will their costs - so neither of us really know the extent by which this will really help/hurt them"
2021-06-14 23:53:19,wallstreetbets,🍿
2021-06-15 00:02:52,wallstreetbets,"NIO is a good example... They delivered 20,000 cars in Q1' 2021 yet lost $45M (USD) in that same quarter on operations. If you look at the prior 3 years as they are ramping up to their current rate of 80,000 cars a year, their losses on operations for those three years were about $2.5B USD.

I don't quite understand how having Magna involved makes that loss smaller. If anything, Magna will want to do this profitably (why would they take a large risk here?), so Fisker will have less profit on the vehicles.

Comparing companies by revenue is good for early stage companies, however you can't ignore factors that suggest the company might be headed to bankruptcy. Do you honestly believe there is the same shareholder support for Fisker as there was for Tesla when they had to raise billions?

As to Fisker executing, I think that is a bit of a reach. They were first focused on their supercapacitor then their solid-state battery, which they dropped. Henrik said that you get 90% of the way there, but then that last 10% is harder than the first 90%... Basically, they talked the talk, but like many others could not walk the walk. I am curious why anyone thinks they will successful execute on the Ocean (or any other vehicle). If Magna was able to magically make profitable EV's, well then where are they? Why is Magna not making them? Fisker, will get 90% of the way there then draw a new picture of a car and make up some new specs that will beat Tesla.

That Henrik makes claims about technology, is nothing new, he has been doing this for years. It just does not translate into solving the final issues or getting to volume production. Where is this car that will be cost competitive with the Model Y and have better performance? I have not seen one. Does Henrik think Tesla is sleeping at the wheel waiting for them to come out with a car? Peter Rawlinson at Lucid thought Tesla was sleeping at the wheel, and he was caught with his pants down (proverbially) with the new S Plaid and its carbon wrapped motor. Now it is all about the range apparently... Well Tesla has access to superchargers so range is not as critical there, but in any case I am not sure why Tesla cannot add some batteries to get some more range if they wanted, but whatever.

Other than the failed Fisker Karma (the company went bankrupt so one way or another it did not work out for them) which had a couple of thousand units produced, Henrik Fisker has not brought a product to market (T-Shirts don't count). As you can see, from NIO, from VW, and from TSLA (and from RIDE, lol...), the cost of getting to volume production where you become operating cash-flow positive is going to be prohibitive and more than what they have on hand. So no, this is not a good bet. Investing in this company is probably a terrible idea as long-term their prospects are not good at all. Right now you are paying $3 for every $1 of cash they have, which probably tells you the company is minimally priced 3X more than it should be."
2021-06-15 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"An alternative to dollar cost averaging into stocks: Retire in 5 years with LEAPs Clarifications: 

1. Some people are claiming that I cherry-picked data by leveraging the last 5 years of raging bull market. I am aware that this was a particularly good time period for stocks, and have explicitly acknowledged this issue in the original post itself. This strat also works over the [life of data](https://www.quantconnect.com/docs/data-library/options) (**2010-2021)** that is available to me. This 11 year period includes the 2020 flash crash, Aug'11 bear market, 2015-16 China crash/US markets selloff, 2018 crypt0 crash, and 2020 covid crash. 
2. Testing over 2007-2008 would have been great, and I concur with many of you that if markets stayed flat over 2 years, this strat loses substantial capital. This is also acknowledged in the original post. I'm not claiming this to be some strat with [huuuge upside and very little downside](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJXLV_DMKa0), just an interesting way to deploy leverage. 
3. Backtests do not guarantee future success. They only prove that a strat would have worked in the past. This is true of backtests that are statistically significant AND of those that aren't. My philosophy is that if you're going to gamble, use all the data you have to optimize your odds, and do it as scientifically as possible. I'm working towards adding a hedging component. All research will be open-sourced. If you have any constructive ideas for reducing drawdowns/ruin probability and such please DM

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Tl;dr: DCA every month into index LEAPs instead of index funds to outperform the markets. Crazy right?**

**Disclaimer: This isn't financial advice. I am not a finance professional.**

Who this is for: This research is from the pov of salaried folks like me who are midway to FIRE, who have fixed income guaranteed for at least 2 years, and with the optionality to keep working for a bit longer if the strategy goes badly. Our goal is to advance retirement by aiming for higher than market *total* returns - not *risk adjusted* returns (hate that term by the way) or more correctly not *volatility adjusted* returns. If this doesn't describe you, this post won't be useful to you.

""Dollar cost average into index funds"" is the most non-controversial financial advice you can get. It has long been the gospel of bogleheads and other hands-off styles of investors and for a good reason: Stocks follow a Weiner process with positive drift. viz. Over the long term markets go up, and in the years when they go down they fall less than they gain in the years when they go up.

Then the question must be asked - is there a way to leverage this.. loosely speaking.. ""guarantee"" of positive movement over the long term? What is the safest way to do so?

I could think of 3 ways:

1. Buy index funds on margin. This is well studied and [documented](https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=5934). I personally dislike this approach because of interest rate risk, margin requirement change risk, flash crash risk. Besides the only broker which offers a reasonable margin rate (that the dividends on SPY will sufficiently pay for) is IBKR and it comes at the price of not doing margin calls. They'll sell your investments at the worst possible time. 110% long is the highest I am willing to go with this method.
2. Levered ETFs - I am not knowledgeable on this subject but from what I understand they're not meant to be held long term due to contango and rebalancing. Please feel free to correct me or add color.
3. Buy calls. Control the upside on 100x shares for less that the price of 100x underlying. This is the subject of this post

Research methodology:

I backtested this approach with Quantconnect and found that buying 40 delta calls that expire at least 1 year out (LEAPs) every month and scaling in slowly over 2 years beats the market by 5:1. The approach is not without risks. Options are a wasting asset. The scenario in which it loses the entire capital invested is if the US stock markets behaved like Japan in the 90s.

Investing in stocks lump sum is preferable to DCA but it would be too risky with options. So we scale in slowly over 24 months, buying a fixed dollar amount worth of SPY LEAPs.

Leverage is set to 1. We won't be borrowing money to buy calls. Margins calls are terrifying enough with equity. Built-in leverage is sufficient.

No stock picking, no market timing, no indicators, no hedging. Wake up once a month, find the expiration that's closest to 380 days from today, identify a 40 delta strike (slightly out of money) and buy a preset dollar amount worth. Do this for 2 years. Sell the call 2 weeks before expiry (avoids assignment, gamma risk, accelerated theta decay). After 2 years, stop adding more principal, just reinvest profits the same way as before. For example on June 1st 2021 we would have bought SPY220617C00445000@$194.

Why 40 delta? 2 weeks? 2 years? These were just common sense starting points. I'm sure you can fine-tune them but I did not want to risk overfitting the algorithm with additional parameters. OTM calls makes sense intuitively due to volatility skew and the fact that % moves are bigger. ITM calls are more expensive and if I wanted higher delta I'd just buy shares without expiry risk. SPY was chosen because it's as liquid as it gets. The algorithm is buying at ask and selling at bid (market orders). In practice we can try bidding lower/higher with a bit of patience but that's the least of our concerns.

Inb4 ""short term capital gain taxes"" - we choose expiry 380 days out + sell 2 weeks before expiry which means holding period always qualifies for LTCG treatment. This makes our approach comparable with ""buy and hold index"" or ""dollar cost average index"" on a pre as well as post tax basis.

Finally because of the way the backtesting engine works, I had to seed the algorithm with $500,000 paper money and make $500,000/24 = 21k worth of a purchase each month. This means that in the first 2 years we're not fully invested. This cash drag understates the returns a bit but that's okay. If you calculate the TWR on invested capital by hand it will be even higher in practice so no harm done.

Backtest was conducted over last 5 years (Jun'16 to Jun'21). Yes, this method is empirical, and the 5 years happened to be good for stockholders. But I don't have a crystal ball for the next 5 years and this is as scientific as it can get. The important question is whether this strategy has legs or are we paying too much premium to make money over a *sufficiently large and flexible* time period.

Results:

[https://ibb.co/r7wMfwY](https://ibb.co/r7wMfwY)

[https://ibb.co/frswZJn](https://ibb.co/frswZJn)

**Total return for DCA into LEAPs: 609.75%**

**Total return for DCA into SPY shares: 154.49%** (benchmark#1)

**Total return for lump sum SPY shares: 421/190-1 = 121.57%** (benchmark#2)

Worst drawdown - surprisingly low 49.2%

Sharpe ratio - 1.23

PSR - 50.4%

(We don't give a shit about the last 2 metrics. We knew this was going to be volatile.)

My takeaway:

Unless a calamity occurs and doesn't resolve itself for more than 5 years, this strategy will propel me towards an early retirement. I'm keeping all my current savings invested in an all weather portfolio, but the new money will buy LEAPs every month. If this works well, see you in walhalla. If this goes tits up, no biggie, keeping my job for 2 more years won't kill me. Biggest risk to implementing this strategy well is psychological. Human nature is to equate high win rates with better strategies rather than ones with higher, skewed expectancy. I fully expect some of these monthly purchases to go to zero, but hopefully the others will more than make up for the losses. So long as I don't shit my pants and keep buying that is..

Future research:

Experiment with spreads, calendar spreads, diagonal spreads, active stock picking. Fine tuning deltas. Timing the purchases with low IV. Hedging with VIX, gold, bonds, T-bills.."
2021-06-14 23:41:00,wallstreetbets,"  
This is a fine strategy. I've been doing this strategy for a long time now and it's been very good to me. I recommend this strategy to all young people I meet. I'm a little surprised you posted it here, as it's the opposite of r/wsb. This is a multi-decade strategy. If compound interest is the 8th wonder of the world, this strategy is compound interest on steroids. Once you fully grasp the strategy and see it in action, you will understand what it means to have money make money for you. This is a strategy that can build multi-generational wealth and makes you look at risk and time horizon a totally different way. Some thoughts:

* The first decade is slow. It will pick up. The longer you put money into the strategy, the quicker it accelerates. Time is most definitely your friend here. You need to stay disciplined and still buy when market corrects. You will realize buying the dips will be the best thing you do. My 2020 purchases have been very good to me.
* This strategy is not cheap, especially with SPY. For 2 year LEAPs, that's about 2-3k a month for 1 contract. That's a commitment to save/invest 3k a month.
* I buy 2 year LEAPs at 40 delta. I started off with 40 delta and like I said, it's been good to me, so no reason to change/try to optimize. Like you said, it just makes sense. Slightly OTM. The thing is, the delta doesn't mean much when it's 2 years out. No one can predict the future. It doesn't mean you have 60% chance of losing your money.
* There will be months where your strike will be worthless. However, the months you are ITM more than make up the loss. The worst condition for this strategy is sideways. As long as the market goes up and down, there will be strikes that are ITM. So it actually doesn't matter if market makes new high or not. The market doesn't stay sideways for the entire 2 years. People that are talking about recession don’t really understand the strategy. If the market drops, 40 delta means your strike is also lower. You move with the market. 2008/2009 means 40 delta you bought back in 2006/2007. So yes, the 2007 was a wasted year. However, whatever you bought in 2008 onwards, you would have made bank in 2010. People are criticizing this strategy as if it was riskless. There is no such thing as riskless in the market. Because of leverage (options), you will not be worst off than DCA in underlying. You are always buying low and selling high. You will always be catching the lows. People criticizing the strategy aren’t comparing it to a benchmark. They’re looking to time the market and never lose. This in itself is a fallacy.
* I stick with Jan expiry; makes the process easier and keeps it simple. Specifically, I buy Jan 2023 until Nov 2021. On Dec 2021, I buy the Jan 2024 expiry. You end up with a ladder of strikes. I buy the same number of contracts, so it's not truly DCA in the sense it's not a fixed dollar amount per month. You won't be able to buy a fixed dollar amount like in stocks. I also buy 2nd Friday of the month. 3rd Friday of the month is when monthlies expire, so a bit more volatility. Ultimately, it doesn't really matter, because you're buying something 2 years out, but it makes sense to buy at the same time each month. Additionally, each subsequent month costs approximately the same/little bit less. Even though you’re buying at 40 delta, you’re paying for less time (theta) but IV might be higher/lower.
* First 2 years you're just buying. Like I said, it starts off slow. Come Dec, when your first set of purchases is about to expire, you budget what you need for the upcoming year. Any money remaining, you buy the actual shares. These shares are basically your profit, and cost is effectively 0. Put these on DRIP. It also means you will have 11 months worth of money in cash after December that you then drawdown.
* You start buying again with the money you cashed out from your first set. If you keep on adding money, in theory, you can now buy double the contracts that you did in the first 2 years.
* Rinse and repeat. Take the profit out and convert into actual shares. Initially, it won't be many shares, but if you stick to it, the number of shares you buy each year will grow. 
* Once you've accumulated some shares, you can start using margin and buy more LEAPs. Use margin wisely. The last thing you want to happen is getting margin called and your options forced sold. Don't get greedy.
* SPY is a great choice. This strategy works best for index. In addition to SPY, I also do ASHR, FXI, VGK, VWO. Works for individual stocks too, but must be something you're super long term bullish. Imagine if you did this with the FANGs.
* Do it in a ROTH if you can

As I said, this strategy is DCA on steroids; you're using leverage and margin to turbo charge your investment. Hope this helps. Good luck! 🙏"

2021-06-14 20:36:31,wallstreetbets,"This is intriguing. Assuming a longer time horizon would bring down the risk.

What do you think this would look like without the requirement to worry about tax implications? I'm Canadian, so I could put this in my tax free savings account, and have no capital gains implications. Would the 380 day out still be optimal, you think?"
2021-06-14 21:03:14,wallstreetbets,Would having a limit sell at high percentage gain be worth it if it occurs before the 1yr holding requirements?

2021-06-14 22:41:31,wallstreetbets,This is some stupid shit right here
2021-06-14 23:04:22,wallstreetbets,Good post. It is interesting to see the numbers on this strategy. I’m curious what the returns would be if you sold shorter dated calls a few strikes (20 delta is the suggested strike for monthly calls sold against your leap) above your leap’s strike (poor man’s covered call) for the duration of the time you held the leap. Would your algorithm be able to calculate that?
2021-06-15 10:10:08,wallstreetbets,Is there a threshold level of investment for this to work? Say I start will 20K vs 500K will I see the same ROI percent or will my return be less? I understand that with 20K I wouldn't be retiring in 5yr just looking into different strategies.
2021-06-15 14:40:30,wallstreetbets,I think if you just buy when IV is low you cant lose here.....
2021-06-15 18:03:02,wallstreetbets,"Very good analysis.  Thanks Bro.

Quick question.  Instead of SPY, had i invested in QQQ or DIA LEAPS, would i be better off or worse off? Or there any stock LEAP that can beat 4X leverage factor of SPY stock vs SPY LEAPS."
2021-06-14 22:06:13,wallstreetbets,you're just using leverage. there's no big secret here.
2021-06-14 23:50:29,wallstreetbets,"Thanks, appreciate feedback. I was torn between wsb and r/investing so I posted in both.  Reception in WSB is warmer. Investing, trading, gambling is a smooth spectrum really, as smooth as my brain. Difference of degree rather than kind.

Why is sideways the worst case? Wouldn't it increase IV and hence value of calls? 

I'd rather not do Roth because if it went tits up I can at least tax loss harvest. I use Roth for theta gang plays."

2021-06-15 00:04:41,wallstreetbets,"Sideways mean low vol, so IV is actually lower and options cost less. It's worst because your 40 delta doesn't hit, so you lose money."
2021-06-14 21:06:47,wallstreetbets,I might sound really stupid but if you put 1-3k per month how do you DCA into leaps if they cost 20k ?
2021-06-14 21:37:23,wallstreetbets,Good point
2021-06-15 01:06:35,wallstreetbets,"That's part of it. In practice, it's the IV and spreads on LEAPs that really kill the profitability.

Nothing inherently wrong with holding leveraged products as part of long term strategy. You won't get 3X, but it will be more than 1X."
2021-06-15 16:25:08,wallstreetbets,"Interesting, thanks for checking."
2021-06-15 12:27:12,wallstreetbets,So I can blame you fully if this goes tits up? Check. Just playing. I am really glad you posted this. It seems like a good strategy to be more active in my retirement investing.

2021-06-15 02:47:58,wallstreetbets,"Lol those 11 years outside of the COVID crash were nothing but bullruns.  Thats cherrypicking the data.  The dotcom bubble took 3-4 years to come back from then the great recession was another 4 year event.  Its also resting on the assumption that there wont be down years like there were throughout the 70s 80s and 90s.  Maybe we are in a more safe fundamentally sound economy but they said that after the market recovered from the dotcom bubble and the great recession that things would change and there were safeguards in place to prevent a huge sudden selloff.  And this isnt even taken into account outlying events like wars, natural disasters or manmade catastrophes.    

Take for instance the story came out today about that nuke plant in China leaking radiation.  So lets look at a theoretical problem.  Say the plant goes full Chernobyl its located in the heart of the Chinese manufacturing sector.  How do you think that would effect the market?

This theory puts too much faith in humanity not being greedy or warmongering."
2021-06-14 22:19:17,wallstreetbets,"Bro - thank you, you fuck."
2021-06-14 22:17:22,wallstreetbets,"I get that, but op pitches this as if it’s a somewhat safe investment “unless a calamity occurs”. I disagree. 

One underwhelming year could wipe out all your otm calls unless you sell out early and take a loss. You are taking a huge risk with options even with leaps on spy. That’s why I always buy leaps on stocks with high volatility and have a price target in mind where I take profits. Things can always turn negative quickly and wipe your gains or go into a long slow downtrend where you will never recover in time."
2021-06-15 14:50:42,wallstreetbets,but it means you have to hold for like 360 days before selling to take profit.

2021-06-14 21:23:31,wallstreetbets,"True. It works over 11 yrs (life of data), beyond that we can only speculate. Will it necessarily cost me my shirt? Hard to say. IV expansion may offer a lifeline even if markets stay flat. I have no idea how it would behave if interest rates went up 5% either.

You need to hedge to soften the blow of a correction/crash. You then take that hedge money and buy more. You also want to go some portion to cash sometimes. The general strategy shouldn’t be any different than a balanced portfolio; you’re just happening to use a leveraged product as the underlying.

You will recover much more quickly because it’s 3X. Like I said, I did very well in 2020."
2021-06-15 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"🚀🚀 Outside legal counsel investigation by Sullivan & Cromwell LLP finds that The Hindenburg Report's challenges to the viability of Lordstown Motors’ technology and timeline to start of production are not accurate.  We are headed up high and fast.

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/g3su0uxnta571.gif

**Background**

The Hindenburg Report stated, among other things, that Lordstown Motors had made various misstatements about demand for its Endurance pick-up truck, the viability of the technology utilized in the Endurance, and its ability to start production of the Endurance in September 2021. In response, the Lordstown Motors Board of Directors established a Special Committee of independent directors to investigate the allegations made in the Hindenburg Report. The members of the Special Committee are David T. Hamamoto, Jane Reiss, and Dale Spencer. The Special Committee engaged Sullivan & Cromwell LLP, a leading global law firm, to conduct the investigation. Sullivan & Cromwell was assisted by technical experts from a leading automotive consulting firm.

The Special Committee’s investigation concluded that the Hindenburg Report is, in significant respects, false and misleading. In particular, its challenges to the viability of Lordstown Motors’ technology and timeline to start of production are not accurate. The investigation did, however, identify issues regarding the accuracy of certain statements regarding the Company’s pre-orders. A summary of the Special Committee’s findings is presented below.

**Findings**

**1. September 2021 Start of Production Target**

The Hindenburg Report stated that Lordstown Motors’ plan to start production in September 2021 is unrealistic based on Hindenburg’s allegations relating to recent design changes (including to the composition of frames), a failure to complete necessary testing, a lack of battery pack manufacturing capability, and a lack of hub motor manufacturing capability. The Special Committee concluded that while various factors could lead to delays in the start of production, the projected September 2021 start of production remains achievable with the expectation of delivery to customers in the first quarter of 2022.

The Hindenburg Report cites a purported statement from an anonymous former Lordstown Motors’ employee that Lordstown Motors switched from plastic frames to aluminum frames earlier this year. That is false. While Lordstown Motors made certain changes to the materials to be used for the doors, hoods, and fenders, there has been no change to its plan to manufacture the vehicle frame from steel.

Lordstown Motors has commenced and plans to complete required regulatory, durability, and Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (“FMVSS”) testing during 2021. While certain testing must be completed before Lordstown Motors can deliver the Endurance to customers, none of the testing cited in the Hindenburg Report must be complete before the start of production. Lordstown Motors has begun testing consistent on a timeline that anticipates delivery to customers in the first quarter of 2022, taking into account the potential adjusted production volumes discussed on the Company’s May 24, 2021 first quarter earnings conference call.

Lordstown Motors has sourced battery cells from suppliers, and initial battery pack assembly equipment has been received and is being installed, with remaining equipment due to arrive in advance of the projected start of production date.

Lordstown Motors currently expects to produce hub motors in part using manual processes while the automated hub motor production line is installed over the next few months. It expects this process to provide sufficient hub motor production capacity to support expected production volumes in 2021 and 2022.

**2. Viability Of Hub Motor Technology**

The Hindenburg Report questioned the viability of the hub motor technology used in the Endurance, stating that the hub motors are licensed from a Slovenian company, Elaphe, that hub motors present durability issues because of “unsprung weight,” and that hub motors have not previously been commercialized at scale in the light vehicle market. The Special Committee concluded that while hub motors have not previously been used at scale in commercially-produced passenger vehicles, the hub motor technology licensed from Elaphe is viable. The Endurance was engineered to address the unsprung vehicle mass attributable to in-wheel motors, including through tuning of the suspension, reinforcing the vehicle structure, and utilizing a heavier truck chassis. These measures are expected to alleviate any ride or durability issues that might otherwise arise.

**3. January 13, 2021 Truck Fire**

The Hindenburg Report described a January 13, 2021 incident in which a prototype of the Endurance caught fire during a test drive. The Special Committee concluded that the incident was an isolated event rather than one reflecting a systemic problem. Lordstown Motors conducted a technical investigation of the incident that identified the root cause of the fire to be non-conforming parts on a battery pack that had been manually reworked for assembly on the prototype. During a test drive, the driver accelerated beyond the expected test parameters for that prototype. As a result of the rapid acceleration, the faulty connection point resulting from the manually reworked assembly experienced an overload of electric current which caused the battery to ignite. Lordstown Motors reported the incident to the relevant regulator and has taken steps to address the isolated issues that contributed to this incident. The production process now in place and the automation of battery pack assembly are intended to ensure that this type of issue does not recur.

**4. Pre-Orders**

The Hindenburg Report raised various questions regarding the Company’s practices and disclosures regarding “pre-orders.” Among other things, the Hindenburg Report stated that Lordstown Motors’ pre-orders (i) are non-binding letters of intent, (ii) require no reservation payment and in some instances were procured through the payment of sales commissions, (iii) are from customers that generally do not operate fleets, and (iv) include pre-orders from customers that do not have the means to make the purchases indicated.

Lordstown Motors has repeatedly disclosed that its pre-orders are non-binding, and it has highlighted the risk that pre-orders may not be converted to actual orders.

In most instances, Lordstown Motors’ pre-orders did not require a reservation or similar payment, though pre-orders submitted through a website portal required a refundable $100 payment. Lordstown Motors entered into an arrangement to pay one entity commissions for procuring pre-orders. That entity procured approximately 1,000 pre-orders and also assisted Lordstown Motors into entering into an important commercial relationship with a leading fleet management company.

Lordstown Motors has obtained tens of thousands of pre-orders from fleets, fleet management companies, or other end users. If converted to orders, this demand will comprise substantially all of the Company’s expected production volume through 2022.

Lordstown Motors made periodic disclosures regarding pre-orders which were, in certain respects, inaccurate.

* Lordstown Motors has stated on several occasions that its pre-orders were from, or “primarily” from commercial fleets. In fact, many pre-orders were obtained from (i) fleet management companies or other end users that indicated interest in purchasing Endurance trucks, similar to commercial fleets, and (ii) so-called “influencers” or other potential strategic partners that committed to attempt to secure pre-orders from other entities, but did not intend to purchase Endurance trucks directly.
* One entity that provided a large number of pre-orders does not appear to have the resources to complete large purchases of trucks. Other entities provided commitments that appear too vague or infirm to be appropriately included in the total number of pre-orders disclosed.

**5.** **Other Matters**

The Special Committee also reviewed certain other matters raised in the Hindenburg Report and made the following observations. First, although not in a position to assess ongoing litigation with Karma Motors, the Special Committee notes that Lordstown Motors has denied the allegations against it and is contesting both liability and damages. Second, as described in various Form 4 filings in the months following the DiamondPeak transaction, certain Lordstown Motors directors and executives have sold or transferred shares in the Company. Each of those transactions were made for reasons unrelated to the performance of the company or viability of the Endurance, and each such director and executive retained substantial Lordstown Motors equity holdings in the form of shares and options following the sales and transfers described in the Company’s public filings."
2021-06-15 14:11:02,wallstreetbets,"$RIDE💥  
✅ YES Rich Schmidt confirms, Lordstown is fully funded through May 2022 with millions extra in the bank.  
✅ We have confirmed and verified binding orders enough to fill capacity through 2022.  
✅ 600 employees are hired on to support operations.  
✅ Received FMVSS Penetration Requirements exceeded.  Final certification test will be early fourth quarter.  
✅ There is a prototype that is being completed, which will be shown this summer.  The prototype is set up to use same products, build, and platforms as the Endurance."
2021-06-14 21:00:45,wallstreetbets,"I can't comment on much but the test fire. The way it sounds is they had to throw together some prototype setup to get it to function to test a different part. This is common afaik for prototyping since you only care about testing A, then B doesn't need to be perfect. This is from an electrical standpoint, anyway.

Example: waterproofing testing. We used bluetooth to see if the device was working while underwater to let us know if water got into it. If any water did, there was a possibility of the whole thing burning up from shorting the battery, not just malfunctioning and just stopping. Then let's say we pushed it too far underwater past the case's limits of handling water. Whoops, we caused a fire by pushing it a little too far. It wasn't due to a design flaw for the actual system, but a mistake made during the actual test. This doesn't ruin the test results, but does cost one semi-working setup and we have a fire in our list of problems.

This is all based on just this DD so if there is more info about the actual fire, etc, then I don't know what *actually* happened."
2021-06-14 20:55:11,wallstreetbets,Yep it was by the law firm they hired.  The same law firm that handled their SPAC merger.  Their report didn't actually dispute anything in the short report either.  It's just a bunch of double talk and intentionally vague statements.
2021-06-14 20:52:22,wallstreetbets,"Junk bonds, at a high interest rate, sell more shares further decreasing your shares value and they still don't even have a working test vehicle..."
2021-06-14 20:58:30,wallstreetbets,"So, lawyers represent criminals and innocent alike.  They left everything vague or answered a different question instead of what was in the report.  Like how they went on about the frame of the vehicle isn't changed when the short report was talking about all the exterior changes in materials."
2021-06-14 21:34:30,wallstreetbets,"No one is saying there was not some bandaged approach that contributed to this. Hindenburg posted a copy of the police report that stated ""*... they were driving the vehicle and noticed the truck was driving weird... he pulled over and the Endurance started on fire from underneath the truck.""*  it is possible that they overloaded the circuit which caused a short in the wires to one motor so perhaps it only had the other motor going, I am not saying otherwise. The fact is simply there was this fire with that early prototype from Jan 2021, which reasonably raises questions about whether they will have production later that year."
2021-06-14 21:55:05,wallstreetbets,Done
2021-06-14 20:56:35,wallstreetbets,"No it's not a legal investigation.  It's a guise of an

2021-06-14 21:00:03,wallstreetbets,Serious question… what would change your mind on Lordstown?    Producing a truck?  Winning an award with said truck?  X number of sales and revenue?  Revealing additional vehicles and actually producing those vehicles?
2021-06-14 22:09:36,wallstreetbets,"You are right, then. I thought the post/legal report gave enough context, but I assumed too much. I didn't know they put it on an actual road and not an in-house test."

2021-06-15 00:27:56,wallstreetbets,I said the same price for my January 2021 LEAP for $10 strike back before the original $20 spike but kept them because of the sentiment from that spike predicting a higher run up.
2021-06-15 00:29:10,wallstreetbets,Oh that one is a beauty. You love to see it.

What’s 50, 151,625 and 140,885
Where’s 1311.77% from?

2021-06-15 00:43:34,wallstreetbets,Learn how to bankrupt yourself?
2021-06-15 01:38:01,wallstreetbets,"First thing is to adjust that $11k buy in to your personal situation. You can buy in to a single contract on for $50 or less to figure out how it works. Assume you will lose that $50 with 99% certainty. Next most important thing to understand is that some options you can never lose more than your buy-in, some have potentially INFINITE losses. Know exactly what you're doing when you hit that buy button."
2021-06-15 04:02:22,wallstreetbets,Investopedia has a simulation that gives you fake money tracking the real market. There's info there as well.
2021-06-14 21:26:52,wallstreetbets,"My tip: start with small premium calls and buy only one contract at a time, then you can wait a few days to get a feel for how the price is changing. If you still believe in the contract and the price goes down, buy more. When you have a feel for where the bottom is you can buy a bunch. Then buy some higher premium calls ITM if you choose near what you think is the bottom and you wait until it pops. Then when it pops back your dollar cost averaging will launch you. I’ve used this strategy and 10xed my profile the last two weeks."

2021-06-14 21:49:33,wallstreetbets,"A call is a contract that gives you the ability to purchase 100 shares at a price you choose before a date you choose. A put is a contract that does the same but gives you the option to sell at a price you choose before a date you choose.

So what OP did above:

He bought 50 $40 calls for $214 each and he has until September 17 2021 to execute his option. So he can buy 5000 shares for $40 if he wants. 

Obviously this is a very good thing when the price of AMC is $57 because it's guaranteed profit. If he doesn't have the cash on hand to execute the option, he can simply sell it and someone else can take on the risk until Sep 17."
2021-06-14 21:44:59,wallstreetbets,Just check out InTheMoney on YouTube. Watch all of his videos. ACTUALLY watch them or you’re gonna get burned and then bitch about it.  If you have a smaller account I’d recommend trying PMCC (also on InTheMoney’s channel). Good luck
2021-06-14 21:56:05,wallstreetbets,"ELI5: A call is a coupon that you can buy. It let's you buy some pizza at a specific price, as long as you use the coupon before the expiration date.

ELI15: A call is the right but not the obligation to buy a specific stock at a specific price (the strike price). You pay (a premium) for this, and it's only done in lots of 100 shares of stock although most of the displayed prices will be per share. The premium will vary based on the current price of the stock compared to the strike price, how volatile the price is, and the amount of time until the option expires. Ideally, you want to buy an option before a big jump and then sell afterwards. Because if a stock is trading for $12 a share, buying a coupon that lets you buy it for $20 a share isn't going to be too expensive. But if the price then shoots up to $60 a share, suddenly that $20 coupon is looking pretty good.

They can make you money faster than stocks because it's cheaper to buy a coupon than a share. *But* at expiration you can lose *everything* rather than sitting there with at least some shares in your account."

2021-06-14 21:49:45,wallstreetbets,"Essentially, this call contract is a bet that the price of AMC shares will be above $40 on Sep 17th of this year.

A call contract is a ""bundle"" of 100 shares, and OP paid (on average) $2.14/share/contract, meaning, $2.14x100 shares $214, and OP holds 50 contracts, bringing the initial value to somewhere around $10,700.

Op could sell them right now (at time of the screenshot) at market value for $30.32/share, which is where the $151,625 comes from.

Op could also exercise the contracts, meaning exercising OPs contractual right to buy 100 shares at $40/share (strike price), no matter what the market price is. As long as it's exercised before EOD Sep 17th, the expiration date. And OP owns 50 of these contracts, which would be the equivalent of 5,000 shares.

And also that OP fucking nailed it."

The value of each contract is now $30.32, which if you subtract the initial cost of $2.14 is $28.18 profit PER SHARE per call contract. Since each call contract is for 100 shares, 28.18 profit per share per contract * 100 shares * 50 contracts = $140,900 profit"

Made a gain of 140885, so to calculate gain percentage, we divide the total now by the initial investment and multiply by 100: (140885/10700)*100 = 1316%

Isn't it always better (financially speaking, not as much from a meming perspective) to cash out on whatever IV is left on the option before it expires? You could then use that IV money to buy even more stock than if you had just straight up exercised.

That is at least what I would think: I have always sold my options before expiration, and have never been in a situation where exercising made sense.  Not saying it is impossible to happen.  I always thought exercising was mostly for when you want to make a statement about still being ""in it"", like DFV."
2021-06-14 23:15:29,wallstreetbets,"Wait, what? What is execution/exercise?  Don’t you own the 150k outright with the Options contracts that you bought?  Again, I’m sorry for my lack of wisdom in this.. 💀

Oh! Something just clicked in my head..so, you have 2 “options to exercise?” You can sell all those 50 options contract of 100 piece-lots for that price of 30.32 each and walk away happy with $150k+; or you can also buy those 5,000 shares at that $40 each for $200,000 cost, regardless of current price?  So if the stocks are worth hypothetical $80 a share right now, you still get to buy them at $40 per share, and instantly gain $200,000 added value based on hypothetical current value of $80 per share? Is that right? With initial cost of $10,700?  Wow..😱🤯 💎🙌🏼"

The majority of these types of plays end up losing tons of money or even expiring OTM. Hell OP could've lost his shirt just by panicking when it was down 80%."

The higher the volatility at the time of purchase, the higher the price per share (X) is going to be. There are other factors that impact price, but implied volatility is the biggest one for something like meme stonks.

A call option gives you the rights to 100 shares of a stock at the strike price. If the price of the stock is above your strike price, you are in the money. If the expiration comes around and stock price is below the price of your strike price, congrats you just lost all your money you retard. Most people do not exercise their options. Instead, they sell them when the price per share of said option skyrockets. In this case, the OP is up over 1000%, which means the price per share of his options are over 10x what he paid.

2021-06-15 00:23:50,wallstreetbets,"Buy high, then after realizing you were the victim of a pump and dump, buy obnoxious amounts of shares periodically all the way to the bottom in order to lower your average price per share. Repeat until you’re broke or rich."
2021-06-15 00:09:42,wallstreetbets,"The option is to buy it at the ""Strike Price"" that is stated on the option contract itself.  In this case, these are options to buy AMC at $40.  They can be executed any time before they expire, which in this case is Sep 17, 2021."

2021-06-14 23:48:12,wallstreetbets,"If he “sells to close” all or some of those contracts does he just collect the profit and that’s it minus the cap gains taxes he will owe at tax time to the IRS?  I’m still confused about selling contracts you have purchased for profit as opposed to selling (writing) calls.  I never want to sell calls because without owning the shares it can hurt you, so if I buy calls and then sell them for a profit when they go ITM am I ever in jeopardy of owing anyone other than the IRS the taxes on the profits? Forgive my ignorance."

2021-06-14 23:39:48,wallstreetbets,Is it more profitable to sell a couple and exercise or just sell all the contracts?
2021-06-14 23:33:45,wallstreetbets,No that’s just a down payment on the opportunity to buy them cheaper at a later date.

2021-06-15 01:34:30,wallstreetbets,"Nope...they hit .59 for a day or two, that’s when I got them. Still trying to understand when it’s best to sell before theta starts really killing me."
2021-06-15 00:49:17,wallstreetbets,I always had the impression a lot of people here have the money to burn so the losses are whatever.
2021-06-14 20:57:41,wallstreetbets,"Yeah dude, my contracts were actually down 8,000 at one point held through the most disgusting IV crush I’ve seen"
2021-06-14 21:12:25,wallstreetbets,I just learned that with 2 18Jun  $13 strikes. I was up 300% and got so excited I sold them. They're up 40× today.![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|poop)
2021-06-14 21:46:27,wallstreetbets,"Hol up, I'm still learning this process myself and thought option calls were a contract for the ability to buy. Are you obligated to sell them by the expiration date too?"
2021-06-15 10:59:44,wallstreetbets,"It goes against reddit and their weekly fetish but 3 months minimum in my mind. Now if you are going for a meme stock that everyone is piling in on, and has insane IV, just make sure your cost basis isn't ridiculous"
2021-06-14 22:04:06,wallstreetbets,"Haha fair jab. I’ve been doing options for about 6 months tbh, I lost a lot for a long while before figuring out a simple flow that works for me"
2021-06-14 22:05:04,wallstreetbets,"Buy small first to get a feel for the water, then when the price dips while you still like the stonk you’ll know the exact moment to dump the most in and moon."
2021-06-14 22:24:06,wallstreetbets,"You only ever risk your premium. So he would lose $214 per call (50x214=$10,700). He can't lose any more than that.

It's easy to lose money because options can rapidly change in price and become so worthless that it's difficult to even sell them. As opposed to a stock which will probably always have some value.

For example, you could spend $1000 on an option that expires tomorrow and if the price just ticks down a few times you're option is worth $0.01 very quickly."
2021-06-14 22:34:19,wallstreetbets,"He said he bought it when the price was around $13... the 30.32 represents the value of the option contract (x100).  Basically each contract he bought for $214 back in march is worth $3032 now.  You can't cancel the call, you can either sell it before the closing date for whatever it's worth at that time or you can choose to exercise your options at the closing date and buy 100 shares for each contract @$40 each.  For 50 contracts that's 5000 shares x $40/share so he'd need $200000 to exercise all 50 options."
2021-06-14 22:21:17,wallstreetbets,"You lose your entire premium and your call is worthless, or you can choose to exercise it which, if the stock went down would be even worse."
2021-06-14 23:27:13,wallstreetbets,"If you want a (relatively) low risk way to start practicing with them, sell a cash secured put for a stock you're somewhat interested in. With this option, someone's paying you some money and in exchange you agree to buy stock from them at a set price. 

Say they're paying you $10 to agree to buy 100 shares at $2 a share on Friday. So if on Friday the price is $1.50 a share, they sell to you because you made a bad choice. Or Friday comes and the price is $3.00 a share so they don't sell you anything and you pocket your $10 and try again next week.

Once you have those shares, sell a covered call. Now you're the guy selling a coupon. You paid $2 a share, you want some sort of profit, so you agree to sell at $3 a share. Somebody pays you $10 and you wait to see whether you made a good deal.

Google search a good options profit calculator and get used to the difference between buy open/sell close and sell open/buy close. That'll also help teach you why some crazy guy is willing to pay $5 for an option that has no chance of paying off."
2021-06-15 10:20:37,wallstreetbets,"Same as stock prices are set, some people have limit orders to buy at $5 and some have limit orders to sell at $10 and you can come in and set your own limit order or buy at the offered price. The specific dates and strike prices are actually requested and set by Chicago I think? That's why GME might have stuff available for every week at any price but a smaller stock may just have a couple dates and prices to choose from."
2021-06-15 00:51:04,wallstreetbets,I think market makers take that loss. I'm not really sure. Probably the same as if you bought shares and sold for profit.
2021-06-15 10:12:20,wallstreetbets,"There might not be any losses, just lesser gains. Say I buy AMC for $10 and sell you a call at a strike price of $20. It shoots up to $60 and you buy my shares for $20 and immediately sell them for $40 profit. That's real good for you, but even though I missed out on the big gains, I still doubled my money plus whatever premium I got from selling the calls. That's if they're covered calls, naked calls are different and market makers typically have specific formulas about how much can be naked vs covered. They would have already bought all the shares to cover before it hit $60 but they might have been buying the last couple at $20 so they wouldn't had made as much as me."
2021-06-14 20:56:02,wallstreetbets,"WHUUT?!?! *ANGRY APE NOISES*
Seriously tho, what's the next move, gotta pay these taxes then."
2021-06-14 22:03:15,wallstreetbets,Wouldn't gains be tax free in a Roth? (Until you take distributions)
2021-06-14 23:10:36,wallstreetbets,"He can lose if the share price drops below 40 and he still has the contract. But he'd only be losing the initial money he paid, as his option is now worthless."
2021-06-15 10:06:08,wallstreetbets,So I over simplified. 1 call contract is the right to buy 100 shares at the strike price. You don’t own the shares. It is cheaper but riskier to buy calls than shares.
2021-06-15 00:15:54,wallstreetbets,Well I got that last part down for sure.

2021-06-15 08:32:38,wallstreetbets,"One thing I have been curious about. If you buy an option and it is in the money by the time the contract expires, do you need to sell the contract before it expires if you do not plan to exercise it? Is there a way to exercise an option immediately so you don't need the capital to pay to exercise the option and instead exercise the option and then immediate sell the stocks at market value for your profits?"
2021-06-15 01:11:37,wallstreetbets,How to you pick an expiration date?

2021-06-15 01:30:56,wallstreetbets,Gate keeping is retarded
2021-06-14 23:05:52,wallstreetbets," If it seems 10% swings in a day aren’t uncommon. That kind of surprised me when I started doing my own trading. The first time I saw a position drop 10% in a day I sold that shit so fast. And of course two days later and would have been up 6% but I didn’t know what I was doing really and whatever it cost me $500 or something. Am I just on the hot stocks or what? Yeah I trade mostly in WSB securities, but a lot of the tickers we talk about in here are seriously great plays. So it’s not that uncommon either right? Multiple times a day no probably not, but up and down 15% for a 30 point swing in a week happens all the fucking time around here. Scary at first."
2021-06-15 02:39:49,wallstreetbets,"But your options can have +/- 10% in 10 minutes. If you know how to catch the waves, you can ride them early, then close your computer and start drinking.

Don't forget to pray, and give back."
2021-06-15 00:42:19,wallstreetbets,Am I wrong or did he make way more money selling the contract than he could have by exercising.
2021-06-15 09:34:27,wallstreetbets,"The worst case is you lose the money you paid for the option, which would happen if the stock price changed so that exercising the option didn't make sense.

If you paid 100 for the option to buy a stock at 20 a share, but then, by the expiration date, the stock fell to 10 a share, your option was worthless, as you could buy the stock on the open market for cheaper than your option allows.

You're still only out the 100 you paid for the option.

You might be thinking of Securities Lending, when you borrow a stock and resell it. If the price of the stock goes above what you sold it for, you're getting pinched and can have potentially infinite losses."

2021-06-14 23:58:15,wallstreetbets,"Yep, as long as there are people out there that are willing to pay for these contracts, and he can sell them all for that price, he simply just pockets the profit. No hassle. Keep in mind tho, option prices are quite volatile and from my understanding, the prices of those contracts decay as they get closer to the expiration date. 

As long as you are not the one writing and then selling these contracts, you are not in risk of owing anyone anything. If you are just buying these contracts and then eventually selling, the only risk you run is your contracts expiring worthless at the expiration date and you lose your initial investment.

Writing call option of a share you do not own is EXTREMELY risky, so you are correct in staying away. Hope that explanation helps"
2021-06-15 00:27:09,wallstreetbets,"I just started dabbling with very cheap ones (I think that means low premium).  


Last week I got a BB one for like $0.40, which means about $40 (As there are 100 of them in the contract). I did that just to see how they work and was willing to lose the $40 if it did not pay off.  


It did not pay off, they expired worthless. At least it was only $40 and not a yolo... Or maybe that WAS my version of a YOLO lol.  


So this week, I am repeating my mistake and buying another cheap one. I only had about $25 buying power in my account so wanted in on WISH. I got a single Jun18th @ $20 strike at a price of $0.20. That went up to $0.50 today and I would have made $30 on my $20 if I sold it. But then it went back down to $0.25 at close.  


I am 'learning by doing' with these options. I am already learning that they lose their value very quickly when they are short expiry like this. Maybe why I see people talk about losing the options game when playing short expiry options. It was all I could afford though to get in on WISH.  


It's a lottery ticket at the end of the day. If WISH pumps tomorrow then I should probably sell that option so I can buy back in somewhere with longer duration options.  


Let's see where I can go with this $20 and a bit of lucky retarded gambling :)"

I’m trying to understand why puts destroy so many lives."

It doesn’t sound like it leads to a better chance the stock rises or anything, it’s just amplifying the speed at which your money grows or shrinks, right?

I just suggest using the way back machine and looking at some old daily discussion posts and compare them to today. Look at the trends, look at who is posting. Not every bandwagoner is even going to be a shill, once the momentum is there, they don't need to, it's in people's nature to join a cause, just look out for yourself man."

Compare a daily discussion from any time before 2021 to now, it's stupid obvious how manipulated you fucks are. Every thread, top 20 posts are all the same stock you guys are dumb as fuck and giving your money to millionaires because you think any of this is real and have no clue how markets work and will buy into any meme and trend you see.

At least then everyone here was content with just not knowing how markets worked and could suffer in our losses together for the 1 retard who would win the lottery and actually get rich off of some stupid YOLO.

Now it's just spam and viral marketing and FOMO and you fucks are so clueless and new, you don't even realize that it's not normal. I welcome any new people who are here to take their chances to make it big off their hunch or have something meaningful to share. But repeating memes and hype and spouting the latest bullshit you heard is fucking cancer and most of the new ""members"" we have have fucking ruined the place.

It's not gatekeeping, it's people coming and taking our place and making it their own, for profit.

2021-06-14 23:46:52,wallstreetbets,"I can't explain all of it. And much of this is probably(almost definitely like 110% with a 2% margin of error) also down to personal perception.

I started trading or ""investing"" circa 2006.  This is when a lot of the internet brokers came onto the sign were becoming well established. In 2000, fees ranged from $10 to $30 a trade and that's for online no broker trades.  By 2005, most of the big players like E-Trade(and it's baby) or TD Waterhouse(which later bought out Ameritrade to become today's TDA) were charging in the low teens if not below $10.  So this was my entry and also among many others first explosion in day trading.(Again this is my perception, I cannot recall ""day trader"" as a career before this but that may be the limits of my own experience).  Btw, this was so long ago, that YouTube didn't even exist yet. Smartphones didn't exist.  Reddit and Digg didn't exist.  The iPod was still using a hard drive.  I was trading BOA and it was around the $30-40 range. I remember watching its earning report and after spectacular news, it was up 2%.  And it was one of the high movers(there may have been bigger swings but again that is my experience).  This was roughly May/Jun 2008. Because I remember buying around $36 and watching it dropping into the mid $20s. I realized I did not know shit about anything. Btw before the end of year, it would hit a low of $3.95.  I stepped back and away from stocks for a while since I didn't have a job(income) and the rest o the money in the account wasn't supposed to be touch not that I wanted to after losing $1600 in a week when I was maybe making $100 a week just trading swings in price and honestly not knowing what the shit I was doing.

Social media(not just reddit but all the stock discords and youtubers) alongside free trades have thrown a lot of retail money not just into the market but also into trading.  I was buying BAC at $36 with commission of $13.  Spreads also seemed much wider back then due to less liquidity.  I can't recall the spread but a B/A of $35/37 doesn't seem unreasonable. That mean assuming a single purchase/sell entry/exit, the stock would have to move almost 6% for you to break even: buy at 37 and it would have to move up $2.13 for the bids to reach your cost).  Hence small timers didn't trade frequently.  Hell, I remember reading advice to diversify and buy slowly(not all at once) and thinking how the fuck am I supposed to cover these trading fees?

The free trades make it easy to trade and social media enables certain stocks to get excessive attention.  

I've stayed away from trading for a long time by just finding companies I liked and buying those:

This is a personal record of my trading accounts since 2010. In 2019, I got a significantly higher paying job so I opened the account on the left to be an ""investory"" while my 2010 account would be a ""trading"" account. And up until 2019, I was doing well: my average return year over year was 10.71% in 2019 and averaging around ""safe"" assumption the stocks rose 5% a year.(This number I chose as this was a number I saw frequently in retirement calculations ie assume 5% return on retirement).  I also had the low benchmark of 2% as that is the average US inflation rate.  I wasn't greedy or ambitious. I just wanted my money to not get eaten by inflation. But you can see I lose $20,000 as a trader in 2020 with $120k while I made $10k investing with just $35k.

2021 is a bit different as I've taken my investing account much harder to a multi year approach so most gains/losses haven't been realized at all. But in my trading account, I'm sitting on a loss of $11,000k. Which is not bad given I was down $40k on GME alone due to Wall Street fuckery.

I've learned many of the investing rules don't apply well to trading but a corollary to the old adage ""Don't invest what you can't afford to lose."" is that ""Just because you can afford to lose it, doesn't mean you should.""  When GME free-falled from the $400s, I was distracted at work and assumed the price halts were due to my shitty wifi rather than trading halts and the TDA app doesn't tell you trading is halted.  I bought 100 at 315 before it went to 400. I tried to exit but the order didn't fill. The follow up surge to the mid-hi 200s had me wanting to exit as I thought it was going to fall much harder but I thought ""I can afford to lose all of it""  And I averaged down once it hit the 100s and below. But at $40, I was thinking ""why the fuck did I not follow my own rules for exiting?""

Edit:  oh yea because of the commissions penny stocks were a huge rage with traders"
2021-06-15 00:06:47,wallstreetbets,Welcome to the casino...
2021-06-15 09:49:59,wallstreetbets,Yes.  I’ve pulled back because my post trade analysis of options is telling me I’m ducking up big time so I’ve been paper trading.  And it’s a bit better but still pretty much gambling.
2021-06-15 01:56:12,wallstreetbets,"First of all, he hasn't sold the option yet.

Second of all, that is very nearly always the case. An option always has two components: it's intrinsic value, which is the money that you would make my exercising it right now, and it's extrinsic value, which represents the fact that this contract's intrinsic value *could* grow even bigger before it expires. This option still had a lot of time left on it, and so there is a lot of confidence in the market that this option's intrinsic value will grow before expiration, and so it has a lot of extrinsic value built into it's price.

When you exercise an option, you get money based only on it's intrinsic value.

When you sell an option, you get money based on it's intrinsic *and* extrinsic value.

For this reason, most people don't exercise their options, they sell them off to someone else before they expire to cash in on the extrinsic value component as well.

As the option gets closer and closer to expiring, the extrinsic value gets smaller and smaller."
2021-06-15 01:52:45,wallstreetbets,Most calls do not get executed.
2021-06-15 10:02:14,wallstreetbets,"Contracts have 2 ""Values""

\- The Value for the right to buy/sell for X days (The fee - crazy stocks = higher fee - longer runtime = higher fee) 

\- The actual saving against the market (can be ""0"" if not ITM)

If he exercises it, he only reaps the 2nd part. So you would sell the contract"
2021-06-15 09:46:47,wallstreetbets,"Got it… thanks so much. And good luck on your investments. 

It seems that losses are limited to what you willing to invest into.

2021-06-15 06:16:53,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the clarification. How would one know that they are “writing” a contract? In other words, if “selling to close” is the safe act of simply selling a contract then what are the steps to “writing a contract” and what would you choose on TDameritrade to execute that? I only ask so I make sure to completely avoid writing a call."
2021-06-15 00:25:43,wallstreetbets,"Exactly and you have until the date listed to buy the contract in at your locked in reduced price, or let it expire into nothingness and youre out only your premium/deposit. But options are usually in lots of 100 sso when it says 1 it’s 100, 15 is 1500, etc."
2021-06-15 04:14:19,wallstreetbets,"yeah, sounds like you peaked there, congrats!"
2021-06-14 21:20:39,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, I'd only ever bought one call before and it had expired worthless. Since that AMC snafu, I did catch a multi bagger on CLOV. Had 7 at .35 I sold the first 2 at  0.88 and 2.05, but I did catch the last two at 7.10 and 9.00.  I need to be more patient."
2021-06-14 23:19:14,wallstreetbets,every week
2021-06-14 23:35:44,wallstreetbets,"If you are buying a call to open your position you can never lose more than the premium you spent to buy the option contracts.  Some brokerages will automatically exercise the options on the closing date if you are ITM and you have enough cash in your account. The majority of people trading options will sell their options back to close their position well before expiration and  never reach the exercise date.  Unless you actually want to own the shares you should always sell the option before expiration, either at a profit if you're in the money or at a loss if you're out of the money. If you're out of the money at expiration your option is worth $0, so it's usually better to cut your losses instead of just losing everything. 
Your life can only get destroyed if you sell options to open your position, but that's a whole other post."
2021-06-14 23:40:25,wallstreetbets,"The way you wrote that last sentence makes me think you believe puts and calls are somehow part of the same contractual obligations. They aren't. 

Here's a cheat sheet:

buy put - right to sell underlying stock

sell put - obligation to buy underlying stock

buy call - right to buy underlying stock

sell call - obligation to sell underlying stock

&#x200B;

These events trigger at the strike price determined in the contract."
2021-06-15 02:43:47,wallstreetbets,"Well, yeah. I was answering, ""how do people lose money""."
2021-06-15 09:51:15,wallstreetbets,ITM!  Sweet buns!
2021-06-15 10:17:22,wallstreetbets,"Yes, but if you dump $100 into stock and $100 into options and the stock shoots up the options will make you more money. Some of that is because options are valuable because of their possible value and time. So an option to buy stocks for a specific price one year from now will have quite a bit of value just from that amount of time when anything could happen. When the price rises that time left means there's still time for them to rise even more. Most people won't be holding their options until they expire, they'll be selling them while there's still a lot of time value left that stocks don't have."
2021-06-14 22:24:01,wallstreetbets,It is with gains like that!

My education is that there is investing.  And then there is speculation which is no different from gambling.  In fact, Wall Street used to operate like the British gambling firms and you could place bets on even the results of the presidential election but they removed all that as it was seen as tainted.  But also you can make money from gambling if you know how to control your risk and maximize your odds.

2021-06-15 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"ZNGA - A mobile gaming play 
Zynga Inc. (Ticker: ZNGA) is one of the world's largest mobile game developers and has created popular titles that you know you including: FarmVille, Cityville, FrontierVille, Words With Friends, Mafia Wars, Zynga Poker, Cafe World, and Treasure Isle. Zynga games are online based RPG or MMORPG and the company generates revenue through the in-game sale of virtual goods and advertising.

Zynga games are highly addictive and there are millions of people who play them daily. You probably know someone who regularly plays at least one of their popular games. Millions of stay at home moms and housewives play these games hours a day and due to the addictive nature of the games spend tons of $ on them. Zynga boasts record daily active users up 85% and monthly active users up almost 140%.

One of the latest upgrades, by Bank of America, set the price target at $13.50 and all of the most recent price targets place Zynga higher than its current trading price. Zynga recently acquired the game developers Rollic and Echtra which will further its ability to offer its games across multiple platforms.

Another major revenue source for the company is advertising, which is up 100%. This will be compounded by the fact that Zynga also recently acquired Chartboost, a mobile game in-app programmatic advertising and monetization platform. Chartboost reaches over 700 million unique users each month and is integrated into more than 200,000 mobile apps. Chartboost most of the top grossing iOS and Android app developers.

Zynga's games frequently make it to the #1 position in all of the App stores, including in China where Zynga's userbase is growing exponentially and is part of the reason for the company's 67% YOY international revenue growth.
 


TLDR: Very bullish on ZNGA. Popular games, continually growing revenue, rapidly growing userbase, targeted acquisitions to further improve revenue. 

The play: I'm buying shares at current value."

2021-06-15 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$WISH DD: Wish continues to use an asset light approach to driving higher quality fulfillment, and improving product quality on the platform. Through time and execution this could drive increased retention and spend per buyer. 🚀🚀🚀 $WISH unveiled a partnership with PrestaShop, an e-commerce platform focused on Latin America and Europe.

This is a big deal.

Wish is an open ecosystem. 

With this 2 year agreement, brands on the PrestaShop platform can seamlessly sell on Wish marketplace. 

Currently 300,000 merchants on @PrestaShop and ~$22B GMV on platform. 

Wish Local could benefit greatly. 

If even 10% of merchants on Presta decide to entertain this. This could imply $2B GMV. 

But more so, potentially 30k Local, or nearly 80% more than $Wish Local current base. 

Showed this other day. Around me in Miami here’s Wish Local vs UPS

Wish Local: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E33NER-XwAIRylL?format=jpg&name=large

UPS Stores: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E33NESAXEAIf1is?format=jpg&name=large

I wonder how $WISH could continue this strategy. 

For one 
@jackiereses
 came from $SQ and we know the physical merchant base is enormous. 

Wish COULD / TRY / SHOULD partner with @Square to offer a marketplace for its merchants to sell into value conscious consumers.

This would drive top of funnel to $SQ merchants, if $Wish Local was turned on then it would drive foot traffic.

What one should notice here is how $WISH continues to use an asset light approach to driving higher quality fulfillment, and improving product quality on the platform. 

Through time and execution this COULD drive increased retention and spend per buyer.

I could find better products at my local dumpster. 

Pass"
2021-06-14 21:07:03,wallstreetbets,"I’ve been to AMC and shopped at GME, but I can honestly say that I have never and know no one who shops at Wish.  I do have a long position with $WISH and am currently holding a bag.  Hindsight is 20-20."
2021-06-15 00:36:38,wallstreetbets,"Yup, it's one of the very few meme stocks that is well below its analyst price targets and fair value.  This, together with the fact that it's also a growth play, makes it a much safe YOLO to get into right now."
2021-06-15 00:24:58,wallstreetbets,"Yes.

Here are more up-to-date price targets:

https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/wish/forecast

Average analyst price target is:  **$20.50**

Highest analyst price target is:  **$30**

$WISH is one of the very few meme stocks that is well below its analyst price targets and fair value, making it a much safer YOLO right now."
2021-06-15 00:31:52,wallstreetbets,"The Dollar Store company is a brick and mortars boomer version of selling cheap China quality ""crap"" and has 3x the market cap of $WISH.

Amazon also sells a lot of cheap China ""crap"" and offered to buy $WISH at $10 billion dollars back in 2015.

The current market cap of $WISH is $7 billion.

You may think it sells crap, but the customer is always right and they love their ""crap"", giving the Wish App a 4.7 rating from over 3.5 million ""crap"" buyers on Android and a 4.7 rating from over 2.1 million ""crap"" buyers on iOS.

The point being it doesn't matter what is being sold as long as there are a lot of people buying it.  I don't personally shop on Wish, but that doesn't mean I should ignore the millions of others who do and absolutely love it."
2021-06-15 13:35:20,wallstreetbets,"How much of sales from dollar tree and others alike are from groceries? Or how about things that you need immediately but don't want to spend a lot (greeting cards, birthday stuff, cups, plates etc). Wish takes 11-22 days to deliver, or you can drive 5 mins to your local dollar store and have it immediately."
2021-06-15 00:15:10,wallstreetbets,"Why would I need a burner account?  I'm the OP but not the author of this DD.  I literally credited the author in my post with a link to his twitter thread where I got the DD from.

$WISH isn't a pump and dump that needs to be pumped via burner accounts.

It's one of the very few meme stocks that is well below analyst price targets and fair value, making it a much safer YOLO at this point."

Hope today treated you guys good; I made a bit trading options. Below is the option statistics for today's most talked about stocks. As usual let me know if I forgot any.

2nd day in a row that **AMC** killed it on a 15% bounce. **CRSR** and **WISH** each ran hard today with 11% and 12%. Good job to anyone who played those correctly.

2021-06-14 20:09:28,wallstreetbets,"The one thing I want to point out to everyone is CLNE has had 7 red consecutive days on the daily chart on an uptrend! This is not a known or familiar candlestick pattern, I've never seen it before. The bears will not allow the stock to have a single positive day though the stock is still moving forcefully upward against the bears/shorts."

2021-06-14 20:32:13,wallstreetbets,"Good post. There are too many little kids on reddit that are all just trying to get rich and it's flooding the boards with MULTIPLE stocks, way too many. So many people are going to get burned that way. You have to always follow the money. Look at the call buying and stock volume on WISH today. That means the VERY BIG PLAYERS are involved. If there aren't big players involved, these little kids are going to get demolished, like in WKHS this week when the MM walks that straight down to $9. WISH has very very big players involved. Watch what that does over the next two weeks. It certainly looks like that's what they're going to AMC next."

But the TA looks good for another move up. The data looks good for another move up 

But since I think it will go up, it will probably go down, so I’ll buy puts tomorrow but then it will actually probably go up 

Fuck I just figured Clov out Fuck 

She does look good for tomorrow if she can get the volume. I’ll bet she won’t"
2021-06-14 20:00:04,wallstreetbets,Yeah but I'd rather see it move a little quicker upwards. Maybe even upwards to the point where it surpasses the price i purchased it at.

2021-06-15 01:13:22,wallstreetbets,"Its not ""red"" if it doesnt end below the previous day's closing price. 

The red on the daily candlestick just refers to that day's closing price being lower than the opening price, no relation to the previous day. It just shows you that day's range and movement, open and close.

3 outta 7 previous closing days have been red, including the -4% drop the day before the huge 40something% gapup which ended below the open price."

2021-06-14 20:50:51,wallstreetbets,Shares with a side of options. I might actually just hold it past 6/18 because I think it can go wayyy past $30 if it actually does become the next AMC. You never know and this is just my side money anyways so it's worth the shot.
2021-06-14 20:13:22,wallstreetbets,Exactly

2021-06-14 21:50:32,wallstreetbets,I honestly hope so. My brother bought BB calls at $25 strike price during that GME fiasco when IV was through the roof. I know he paid $2500 a contract and since then the IV crush has killed him.

2021-06-15 00:13:51,wallstreetbets,Honestly it looks like it has really low volume and it kind of just seems like it’s been largely ignored by the market for whatever reason they sell a lot of re-branded products I don’t know

&#x200B;

Lots of people don't really even know what an option is, just know how to take one out. They lose lots of money. 

&#x200B;

Further, its true. If you find an asset with low IV then buy in at the right time you can 10x your investment off volatility. Best of luck man!"
2021-06-14 21:38:16,wallstreetbets,Good man. Stick to what you are comfortable risking. My leaps are 2023s.  So are you saying you bought the $4 strikes?
2021-06-14 20:55:23,wallstreetbets,"Amazon HAS TO want the stock price to go above $13.50, which I think is the price they locked in at from April 15th +20%. They basically locked in a call option that I think triggers in Q3 this year, so by November/December. If the stock isn’t well into the teens or $20’s/share by then, I’d be pretty shocked.

I think they’ll exercise the option no matter what, but they’ll want to make profit immediately from it."
2021-06-15 00:11:33,wallstreetbets,Ugh fucking day trade restriction fucked me out of some money on crsr
2021-06-15 00:27:23,wallstreetbets,"I noticed the low volume too. It’s so strange. I think the fundamentals are there. I also see a lot of people saying it was a Covid play, like gaming is about to drop off now that things are getting better. I just don’t buy it. I’m long in this thing and bullish but damn if I’m not ready for it to do SOMETHING."
2021-06-14 21:25:24,wallstreetbets,Lol you dumbass realize that Citadel has a 5x larger position in AMC than Clove right??!!
2021-06-15 06:17:03,wallstreetbets,"This is why I've left options well alone, I get the basics but that's not remotely enough for me to start throwing money at things.

2021-06-14 22:23:18,wallstreetbets,Yea two 4$ calls expiration January 22 2021 I’m in the money at 15.50 I’m new to this so my lingo is probably wrong my fingers are crossed I can do good on this
2021-06-14 22:25:00,wallstreetbets,My average price is 11.85$

2021-06-14 22:54:26,wallstreetbets,"i think your lingo is wrong...on your portfolio positions, write exactly what it says about your 2 contracts."
2021-06-15 18:26:43,wallstreetbets,"if your calls were 4$ *strike*, they would be 'in the money'  already and  breakeven at 4$ + option cost. Did you pay 11.50$ per option (1150 per contract)?  or did you buy 11.50$ *strike* calls (if those exist) for 4$?"
2021-06-14 22:06:36,wallstreetbets,"Dude. Just look at total stock ownership. Citdeal owns 725,000 shares of AMC which is five times as big of a position."
2021-06-15 01:25:08,wallstreetbets,"BB 4$ call 1/22/22 
2 buys"
2021-06-15 19:17:43,wallstreetbets,Yes 1150$ per contract sorry for my ignorance the options thing is new to me. I bought a few other call options in different stocks for very cheap like 20$ per contract as a practice and did very well so figured I would throw a couple grand at one. my break even price is 15.85 and I payed a average of 11.85 per. I have 10k to buy more options but I’m just trying to get a handle on what I’m doing and any help is greatly appreciated
2021-06-15 01:41:52,wallstreetbets,"interesting. so its not clear to me if the $4 strike is a particularly good play.  

That is so deep in the money that it basically costs the same as the stock and move about the same as the stock because of the delta nearing 1.0. 

If it were me and I wanted more exposure, I'd sell those 4s and buy four 10 strikes instead at the same expiration. Puts you in a better position to profit if e.g. the stock goes to 20 at expiration: $3200 for your 4 strikes, and would be $4000 for 10 strikes; if it is 30 at expiry, 5200 for your 4 strikes and 8000 for 10 strikes and so on.   And thats not factoring time value if this happens soon which would increase the 10 strike value a bit more.

In the alternative if you want less exposure it would also make more sense to buy shares which never expire, and using which you can sell covered calls to generate additional premium."
2021-06-15 02:21:57,wallstreetbets,I see thank you for your help I may just sell these in the next day or two and get out

2021-06-15 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$SNDL CEO INTERVIEW POINTS This is what i’ve got from the interview with the CEO of sundial Zach.

• we’re closing this Inner Spirit deal on quarter three (over 80 retail store acquisition🤯)
• said he will do a STOCK BUYBACK in the future, he means it! Said he is not doing it right now because the returns on the capital will bring in more net revenue then stock buyback could ✅✅
• already 250 credit lending commitments, they are basically becoming a bank to the cannabis industry with almost a BILLION cash on hand. Essentially what i think this does is gives us one step ahead of the competition since we will know what they are trying to do if they are asking us to finance there project. (CANNABIS PRINTS MONEY + BANKS PRINTS MONEY = STONK🤯🤯🚀🚀📈📈)
• something BIG is coming but he just can’t talk about it yet 🤫🤫 the direction he has been taking the company and the stuff he’s been doing i believe it is truly something big he must remain hush hush about
• were already at 100 cannabis stores with millions in net profit  🤑🤑🤑
• 100% DEBT FREE
• RETAIL HAS NEVER EVER BEEN THIS GOOD
• Has new cannabis genetics in the works, supposed to be 🔥🔥🔥
• Not pursuing non profitable revenue to look good on paper
• Looking to find the right opportunities in the US and Mexico markets

It keeps lots of recent comments in memory (a few tens of thousands) and compares all new comments to the old ones, so in effect we've got a soft ""r9k"" setup from 4chan where your comment has to be sufficiently unique within the last couple days to not get auto-spammed.

Everyday look at the WSB daily thread and see which ""undervalued"" ticker with ""high short interest"" is being pumped in here. Don't buy the ones that have taken off already, buy the ones that are barely up, but are picking up steam in the daily thread. **Don't hold for more then a day or two,** take profit, at open - 30 minutes after open the day after a big pump. (Like WOOF, today it had a huge run up, and it likely will in the morning, a sell off usually follows around open-10 A.M.  Repeat this method, don't hold the bag for too long, make great profit."

Lets do some backtesting in Thinkorswim and find out

On March 23, 2020 the price of **SPY 6/18/21 $320** leaps calls was **2.50**. Lets say we used $25k to buy 100 contracts and hold until expiration.

**SPY 6/18 $320** calls are at the price of **105.59** which gives us a total value of:

#$1,055,900

No TA and no DD needed. Invest in a boring index **on a dip** and you can secure your retirement.

People say *""it was once in a life time dip""* blah blah, nonsense. If you bought just $10k in leaps during September dip you are already up more than $100k.

Since this date last week, it has been shown that when used in junction with $PGEN effectiveness has raised in the 79-99% range for various age groups. This only raises chances to pass FDA approval, especially considering they are trying to show that they are working towards cures for diseases without current cures this year. Approval vote is 7-2-21 and only expect price to fluctuate upwards until then. 

Do your own DD but its my PERSONAL opinion that the stock is a great opportunity even without considering it’s possible position if it passes FDA. Just trying to bring attention to a good opportunity incase it doesnt hit the big movers tab, even though it was up 13.24% today.

~to add to PRVB for those interested, typical dips to buy are usually between 9:30-11 and 3-4:30. This is probably typical but has been very consistent for this stock. Gl everyone."

2021-06-15 01:53:55,wallstreetbets," Want to know why I like Tootsie Roll, heres why

During the Korean War, the First Marine Division met the enemy at Chosin mountain reservoir in subfreezing temperatures.  Out of ammunition, Marines called in for 60mm mortar ammo; code name “Tootsie Rolls.”  The radio operator did not have the code sheets that would tell him what a “Tootsie Roll”  was, but knew the request was urgent; so he called in the order.  Soon, pallets of Tootsie Roll candies parachuted from the sky to the First Marine Division!  While they were not ammunition, this candy from the sky provided well needed nourishment for the troops.  They also learned they could use warmed Tootsie Rolls to plug bullet holes, sealing them as they refroze.

Over two weeks of incessant fighting, the 15,000-man division suffered 3,000 killed in action, 6,000 wounded and thousands of severe frostbite cases.  But they accomplished their goal and destroyed several Chinese divisions in the process.  Many credited their very survival to Tootsie Rolls

What the fuck do you care about this, you want to drive the price up for someone else?  No, the dude who already has calls and/or shares wants you to drive the price up for THEM.  Buy shares if you are a pussy and too afraid of getting burned on options.  Buy calls if you are confident the stock value is gonna skyrocket soon and you want to retire next week."

Does it mean that they are good positions to add to your portfolio because American infrastructure, particularly a shift away from a reliance on fossil fuels is going to be big business for a few years? In that case, yes, they are “meme stocks.” You know what else they are? Bullish growth stocks with somewhat of a moat against market correction."

The only issue I can think of is that they're business model isn't very defensible and that someone else comes around and eats their lunch in the future. But to say the analysts ratings are already priced in is ridiculous when the stock is trading at a 40% discount to their price targets.

2021-06-15 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"CLOV & WISH, DD regarding inflation. What’s going on shit hawks,

TL;DR inflation has little impact on these two companies who are essentially debt free. Bull horns on both CLOV and WISH.

I’m surprised no one is talking about this.

Figured, I’d discuss it and go over something important to know about CLOV and WISH. Super bullish by the way and here’s why:

People seem to not be chattering up about the federal reserve inflation meeting this Wednesday and Thursday. Personal opinion, whether it’s good or bad, it’ll still effect the market.

Every fucking time there’s something about inflation in the news, Ex: “Inflation meeting this week” or “analyst are expecting inflation to have a big impact on markets” etc. it fucking sends the market to drill to the Earths core like the Russians did.

But here’s the thing, why does inflation affect the market? It effects companies with large debt to equity ratios. Reason being is pretty simple, inflation goes up, interest rates go up, debt/loan interest goes up, larger payments cut into margins. Also, other factors like demand, economy, etc.

Now, why did the title mention CLOV or WISH? Well the reason why is because both these companies are pretty much debt free.

CLOV total debt: 55.94M

WISH total debt: 48.00M

With the size and revenue these companies generate, you can essentially consider them debt free.

Apart from these being considered “meme” stocks, large short interest, undervalued, and the works, which has been discussed a bunch on here by myself and many others, I believe whether the inflation meeting is good or bad news, it’ll have little to no impact on these two companies fundamentally as they essentially have no debt.

CLOV - debt-equity-ratio: 0.10

WISH - debt-equity-ratio: 0.04

The ideal Debt/Equity ratio for a business is to be under 2.00.

As you can see for CLOV and WISH, they have extremely low Debt/Equity ratio.

One company provides health insurance and the other is an e-commerce company focus on retailing products at the best competitive price possible.

I’m bullish af on CLOV and WISH and believe that with the inflation concern that will hit the market, it’s good for everyone to know the position CLOV and WISH are in financially.

**Edit:** I’m not an economist or a financial advisor nor should you take my ape post as financial advice. I’m just pointing out here that these two companies are debt free or have very little debt.

This is positive because let’s say inflation did hit, and the companies needed to take on debt to expand for instance, not only will they have a higher likelihood of being approved, (Debt vs Liabilities vs Revenue), just the general consensus that these companies have little to no debt, this is what’s important to understand. Financially, they’re very healthy.

Second, I’ve seen some comments talking about how the debts are at a fixed rate etc, and that’s true, to an extent.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Redditor** **Comment:** But the current interest rates that companies hold are fixed and those debts won’t be impacted by inflation.

**My response:**

Correct, and there’s also a lot more factors involved on what and how inflation can impact a business and economy.

But don’t think because they’re a company or business that they don’t carry or hold any variable or floating interest debt products. Whether it be loans, derivatives, securities, etc. Not all debt is at a fixed rate for x amount of time. The debt that is variable or floating interest, will be impacted. It also impacts the consumer, but here’s the kicker, one company provides health insurance (Not typically impacted by inflation) and the other is an e-commerce company who retails products at competitive prices which attracts a whole segment of consumers on its own. If inflation ever got really bad and us apes go broke, where do you think we’re going to get our products from? The places that sells it at the cheapest price, you get where I’m going with this? 😂

I don’t know, this ape seems to think this is looking good. I’m retarded, I’m not a financial advisor.

Edit: also, inflation is good for people with loans as they repay the same dollar value with money that’s now worth less. It’s bad for lenders."

Planet 13 is a sensation with the mainstream media, and has made headlines with its celebrity partnerships, such as the one with [Mike Tyson.](https://www.planet13lasvegas.com/2019/04/11/planet_13_mike_tyson_tyson_ranch_launch/) It also proved that it can be successful during the pandemic, and while COVID was affecting businesses everywhere, Planet 13 doubled down and committed to expansion plans at its [Las Vegas store.](https://www.newcannabisventures.com/planet-13-powers-through-pandemic-as-it-builds-war-chest-to-finance-expansion/) Its assets from 2020 to 2021, during pandemic times, increased from $150 million to $218 million.

I think this is an exciting time for Planet 13 as the store has carved out a niche for itself by catering to tourists. As the outlook on the pandemic continues to look more and more positive, Las Vegas (and now Disneyland) will undoubtedly start to see a surge in visitors. Couple that with the talks about marijuana decriminalization on a [federal level](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/house-reintroduces-bill-decriminalize-cannabis-create-social-equity-programs-n1269017), PLNHF could be set for the moon. Check out the stock history and the company for yourself. I’ve been tracking it since it went on OTC at $0.60 and it is currently sitting around $7."

2021-06-15 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"A firm, well-rounded DD for OTGLY Note: The company is traded on some other stock exchange in another country, so I'm not even sure if I bought the right stock.

I spent some time doing some deep analysis on this stock, and I came to the conclusion that it's a solid investment. Here are the results of my analysis:

* CD Projekt makes games.
* Games with titties.
* Last fall they released Cyberpunk 2077.
* CP2077 has titties, but it also has lots of bugs.
* People got mad.
* Not about the titties, but about the bugs.
* Their stock dropped from 31.00 to 10.11 over a few months.
* They're going to keep making games, though.
* Games with titties.
* I like titties.
* Other people like titties.
* I read somewhere that their low value means someone may want to acquire them.
* Makes sense. I'd like to acquire them titties.
* I saw some people complaining about the stock having ""low volume.""
* All I know is that those titties don't have low volume.
* Back in January, Musk said he liked the game. The stock went up a bunch, but then it dropped back down.
* Confirmed: Musk likes titties, but he couldn't keep it up for very long.
* That's fine. There's plenty of other titty lovers out there.

I'm not saying you should invest if you like titties. No, that wouldn't be very inclusive of me. What I'm saying is that you should invest if you think there are other people out there who like titties.

Postitions: 2579@17.00

Currently trading at 12.44. I'd buy more, but I spent the rest of my money tipping strippers.

I think my thesis is sound, though, so I plan to hold.

Hold them titties.

2021-06-14 20:38:15,wallstreetbets,"Depends on your ave cost (cost basis), shares and strike price you're selling at. What's your ave cost and what SP are you selling at?  


2200 / $14.90 Cost Bases   
\- I been selling weekly $15 CC  
\- After all the premium I collected, my ave cost is $11.87  
However, I would definitely say the premium we're collecting right now is not normal at all.   


BB is like NOK... slow moving and premiums just suck (because this stonk doesn't move). This was obviously prior to the pre-run up 2 weeks ago.  


I will be riding the $15 CC until the wave is over, which is most likely next week after ER. BB is like NOK... slow-moving and premium will be low AF. The goal will be to lower your ave cost to literally $9 if you can.  


The only thing I can say is, in the future this stonk will rise again because potentially there may be a lot of bag holders after this run. Give it another few months and this cycle will repeat again."

As I begin this DD I think it's important we establish my foolproof C.A.T.S. acronym system while evaluating a potential stock pick in todays environment.

**C**an it be memeable

**A** high market cap

**T**he IV is low

**S**hort interest is high

$WOOF passes all of these with flying colors. The ticker is $WOOF that's probably enough DD for some of you retards. Short interest is high 36%. The 6th most shorted stock on the market. IV is very low on this comparative to other meme stocks. Most importantly for you degenerate fucks 7/16 calls have 70% IV which means this thing has a lot of room to run. Most importantly Petco is incredibly undervalued compared to its peers and has great fundamentals and a bright future in the pet industry.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5j1qq4ya5a571.png?width=275&format=png&auto=webp&s=91c4f357302a4f661d2e19538e3ef2eb10d03bac

 

Petco acts as a one-stop-shop for pet owners in a very streamlined fashion. Competitors like PetSmart give Petco a run for their money, but they have found footing in a solid corner of the pet market. Petco has 1500 stores in the states, Over 100 of those have veterinary hospitals in them, and 85 of them have neighborhood pet spa & outlet locations. Petco is poised for explosive growth as they shift into the pet wellness section with higher margins and away from things like simply pet food. Because as we know you cant give you're four legged friend a checkup thru an app and if you do you'll eventually be looking for some one day shipping on a shovel. Petco is here to stay.

 Pet industry sales in 2020 surpass $100 billion for first time ever. That marks an increase of 6.7% over 2019 retail sales of $97.1 billion. 30% of pet owners said they spent more on their pet/pet supplies in the past year with only 10% saying they spent less. Obviously we love spending money on our pets. As you can see by the growth chart pet grooming and veterinary care takes up a majority of the market share and is expanding every year. This industry is booming and only getting bigger.

Not that fundamentals matter to any of you retards but Petco reported earnings on 5/20/21. They were as follows:

* Earnings per share: 17 cents adjusted vs. 9 cents expected
* Revenue: $1.41 billion vs. $1.27 billion expected
* Petco posted net income of $7.56 million, or 3 cents per share, compared with a loss of $31.2 million, or 15 cents a share, a year ago.
* Total revenue grew by 27% to $1.41 billion from $1.11 billion a year ago, also outpacing estimates of $1.27 billion.
* Petco’s same-store sales rose 28% from a year ago.
* Petco said it gained 1.2 million net new customers during the quarter, which is a multiyear high.
* The retailer expects revenue this year to be between $5.48 billion and $5.58 billion, up from a prior forecast of $5.25 billion to $5.35 billion.
* Petco said its partnership with DoorDash to offer customers same-day deliveries has allowed it to compete with online retailers like Chewy because Petco’s cost to deliver from its stores is lower than the cost to ship.

$CHWY isn't the only company who can sell products thru an app. Petco has a great eCommerce platform that supports BOPUS (buy-online, pick-up in-store), curbside pickup, and ship-from-store, finding 3x to 6x more sales than single-channel customers. As of Oct 31, 2020, they retain roughly 80% of their multi-channel customers. Coupled with loyalty programs (which account for 80% of transactions n the same time period), Petco seems to have built a dedicated fan base. With the strategic location of their physical network--within 3 miles of 54% of their customers--and expanding network of affordable veterinary services, Petco finds customers in deep reaches of various regions nationwide. HP vet Ron Coughlin took the CEO reins in 2018, and he is keen on growing cloud-facing technology. Ron has put focus on investing in data analytics to improve Petco eCommerece and physical store performance, spending nearly $107M over 2018 and 2019 to do so. $CHWY is currently trading at a forward P/E of 245 while Petco's is only 29. The value presented in Petco's current share price and shift towards Vet and wellness care is enormous. I'm not saying $CHWY is a bad company by any means, it's just that Petco is so much more of an attractive investment at their current valuation.

High SI: 36% of their float is currently sold short. The stock had a pop up this week with the other meme stocks and shorts went all in hoping this would fly under the radar.

Low Float: The public float is small on $WOOF between 16M-20M shares.

Lower Volume and IV: Has an average volume of 4M and the options are still priced cheap. 6/18 strike calls are still on the higher end around 80% IV but 7/16 strike calls have 69% IV. If that's not a sign I'm not sure what is.

Petco is an undervalued stock in a high growth sector with an unreasonable high amount of SI. Calls are still cheap, things could get wild if this thing gets moving and if you go with leaps you would be confident with you're investment as this company has great fundamentals and a bright future ahead. And who wouldn't want to invest in the ticker $WOOF that's just awesome.

Positions: 9/17/21 25 strike calls (9)

9/17/21 30 strike calls (5)

2021-06-15 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"ET - Value Play In a market with historically high P/E multiples Energy Transfer (ET) is trading at a P/E below 10 AND has a dividend yield of 5.3%.

Not only is the company consistently profitable but EBIT margins have improved EVERY YEAR since 2013. As of Q1 2021 ET had an EBIT margin of 19.3%.

The company also appears massively undervalued relative to its peers. ET is trading at a P/Diluted EPS of 8.7x. For comparison, it’s peers are trading at a median multiple of 18.4x and average of 22.6x (based on comparable companies identified by S&P CapitalIQ).

Even after it’s recent rally the current price of $11.15 is more than 60% lower than where it was trading back in July 2018 at $18.21.

ET seems like a no brainer value opportunity. I expect significant price appreciation but even if it takes a while I can sit back and collect the dividend while I wait.

2021-06-15 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Time to buy into VVV? Reopening trade, EV demands, and earning data. Valvoline.  The boomer stock you never knew you needed in your life and portfolio.

It's a really old company... founded in 1866... the year after the end of the Civil War (US).  So super well established... your parents and grandparents probably went there to get their cars serviced.

So why am I talking about this boomer stock?

They are poised to grow significantly over the next year with everyone getting back on the road and needing more servicing... I wish I had gotten into VVV last year, but it is still early for the growth they can achieve over the next year and beyond.

From late 2019 through early 2021 they have been rolling out new product lines and services for electric vehicles.  Since people are having trouble getting their older EVs to centers for servicing, this is an area of the market ripe for entry.  And Valvoline is poised and poising to do just this.

&#x200B;

Background:

VVV manufactures, markets, and supplies, engine and automotive maintenance products and services.

It operates Valvoline instant oil change service centers. It operates and franchises over 1,500 quick-lube locations in the United States and Canada. They also serve car dealers, general repair shops, and third-party quick lube locations, as well as through distributors. 

VVV operates in North America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, the Asia Pacific, and Latin America.

Sector: Material

Industry: Chemicals

&#x200B;

Earnings:

They have consistently beaten expectations since q2 2019... including during all of 2020!

[Earnings are amaze balls even during the pandemic](https://preview.redd.it/zap0ahp3x9571.png?width=1560&format=png&auto=webp&s=f11197a03e8766359cdd067eec21436a4b5fe14c)

&#x200B;

Analysis:

For analyst opinions, out of the 13 firms with opinions, here is the breakdown:

Outperform - 2

Buy - 4

Neutral - 6

Underperform - 1

And then when you only look at independent analyst firms:

Outperform - 2

Buy - 1

Neutral - 5

&#x200B;

The vast majority of stock is institutionally owned...

Shares outstanding: 181,078,000

Market Cap: $6.24 B

Institutional ownership: 94.86%

Top owners?  Vanguard and Blackrock.  Combined these two own over a billion dollars worth of VVV.  Probably because it pays dividends and is a super stable company with good financial data and potential for growth over the next year.

Volume is very low: 90-day average volume is only 1,378,434.  No one is selling, and there is a slight dip today marking perhaps an opportunity to get in before the next upswing.  If you like bollinger bands, take a look at the past few months... Bullish.

[Bollinger Bands](https://preview.redd.it/qai9fnw75a571.png?width=3055&format=png&auto=webp&s=df5bdd1cabb8a55e7ea41e3bdb35dc46b2f0d767)

&#x200B;

**TL;DR:**

VVV is a stable company with good financials, plans for growth to support the growing EV market, and tons of locations throughout North America for great positioning for general re-opening as everyone gets back on the roads.  On top of all that, the stock has been climbing for the past year steadily with positive reviews moving forward.  

&#x200B;

This is not a meme stock, and not a pump and dump.  This is a company with good fundamentals and opportunity for growth.  Re-opening will have more people on the road... and no one knows how to service their own cars anymore, let alone EVs.  Valvoline will grow consistently over the next year and beyond.  I am going long with shares and leaps.

&#x200B;

Cheers!

2021-06-15 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Insight into ZG's (Zillow/Trulia/Streeteasy) secret tactics may be the hidden reason why it continues to 'correct' way faster than other housing stocks. Is 'correct' the right word though? Here's a few of Zillow's  bait-and-switch tactics that I've shared with the Federal Trade  Commission and am doing what I can to make sure the SEC is aware of it  too:

To con thousands of real estate  agent's into contracts with Zillow that are a minimum of 3 months long  and cost a minimum of $10,000-$50,000+ ($300-$500 for each ""lead"") Zillow Sales Executives are secretly:

\-Describing Zillow's backlog of old phone numbers and emails as ""NEW hot vetted Buyer leads"".

\-Describing  contact information for people who already have real estate agents and  try to book appointments through Zillow as ""NEW hot vetted Buyer leads""

\-Describing contact information for people who are looking at rentals as ""NEW hot vetted Buyer leads""

\-Describing contact information for people who can't even get a loan as ""NEW hot vetted Buyer leads""

\-Describing contact information for people who haven't even applied for a loan as ""NEW hot vetted Buyer leads"".

\-Describing contact information for people who contacted Zillow on behalf of others as ""NEW hot vetted Buyer leads""

\-Describing  contact information for people who message Zillow things like ""I don't  understand what this is"" as ""NEW hot vetted Buyer leads""

Rather than spending $10,000 for 30 of Zillow's junk phone numbers sold to them as ""NEW hot Buyer leads"" any real estate agent can just pick up a phone book for free (and get thousands more numbers too.)

\-Zillow  also uses software to manipulate the ""lead"" interface numbers. This includes  calling some agents as many as 6 times in 90 minutes after not calling for more than a week to claim it tried  to send the agent 6 ""NEW hot vetted Buyer leads"". A cost to the agent of $2000-$3000+

\-The software also can't do math as it portrays percentages in Zillows favor  in an attempt to make an experienced agent look bad and further justify  Zillow's dark ways.

Additionally, Zillow's Sales Executives, Regional Sales Managers and ""Business Consultants"" refuse to acknowledge concerns about these tactics. 

Source: Dear friend is an experienced developer and residential/commercial agent and this is what I've seen ZG do to him. If anyone at Zillow reads this and disagrees, please DM me for proof. "

2021-06-14 20:03:50,wallstreetbets,"Sell the option when you're in the money. If you have profit, and your gut is telling you it's going to go down, then sell. If the stock does go down and you don't sell, you're fighting against two factors to bring yourself back ""in the money.""

First, you're fighting against the stock price itself, it's down and so it has to go back up to get back in the money.

Second, you're fighting Theta Decay. The longer an option exists, the less it is worth due to time decay or theta decay. So in other words, let's say you purchased 10 contracts at a cost of $1900, and the stock went up $1, making your 10 contracts worth $2100. If the stock goes down $1 again back to the price you bought your contracts at, your contracts now due to theta decay will be worth $1850 instead. So in order for those contracts to go back to being worth $2100, the stock has to go up (hypothetically speaking) $2 to catch up with theta decay.

The bottom line here is, never be afraid to take profit, especially if you get a large surge like a +50-100% increase. We are here to take profit, especially from options contracts.  Even if it may increase more, it's always possible for it to dive bomb even faster.

Cloudera agreed to being acquired at $16/share by Private Equity firm, KKR, but there's a 30-day shopping provision. Cloudera has to act in the best interest of its shareholders. They already posted earnings and showing growth. With rates being so low, we're seeing growth companies benefiting the most because they can borrow so cheaply. Cloudera's bid of $5.3 billion is pennies compared to what larger tech firms like $MSFT, $AMZN, and $GOOGL can afford. This will likely end in a bidding war leading up to July 1st.

2021-06-15 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"I'm taking CRON over TILRAY My decision is purely a long term out look and my own OPINION. In no way am I trying to sell you anything 

Ive worked in the cannabis industry for the last 12 years in Seattle. The landscape of the cannabis industry has changed so much but one thing that hasn't, is the fact that it's so flooded. Like insanely flooded, I don't believe we will ever see a ""Budweiser "" of in the cannabis industry. For sure some brands will be super successful, but for a few reasons I'm pretty certain we won't.  The industry is set up very insulated. Think about you're favorite craft beer. Now imagine if that was the only beer you drank for years and years, draft beer is usually regionally produced just like cannabis. Now out of the blue some huge company starts making beer and selling it. They might find some success, but it won't ever reach ""Budweiser""

So now why I'm choose CRON. These guys get labeled a CBD company but they are alot more than that. They isolate cannabinoids and sell them yes. But all cannabinoids are not created equal, and they are not equal in difficulty to extract and amount extracted. What has me bullish on them is CBG. CBG in my opinion will eventually become the most saught after cannabinoid. You ever smoke a certain strain and just feel filled with joy but other strains are kind of meh. That strain that made you feel super happy was probably high in CBG (terpene profile also plays a part) 

CBG is super hard to extract, and to do it on scale is even more difficult. The fact they have shown they can do this is huge. Vape cartridge companies will be begging for it, and really that's just the tip of the iceberg. Their customer base will be huge. They might even be selling to TILRAY eventually haha 

I hope TILRAY does well, I want my apes to eat with diamond fist.

But if their plan is just to grow weed, package it and sell it. Good luck.

Today Velodyne Lidar introduced the next generation of its Velabit sensor, which addresses the cost, safety, and design challenges of autonomous solutions while delivering state-of-the-art performance.  The solid-state Velabit sensor now has a simultaneously achievable maximum horizontal FoV of 90° and maximum vertical FOV of 70°, approximately three times more points per second than the previous model.

This lightweight and versatile Velabit sensor features a small form factor and low power consumption to maximize battery life and vehicle range. The small size and low cost allow the sensor the unique ability to be utilized in multiple industries and for critical safety applications, such as:

- Automotive and new mobility

- Autonomous mobile robots

- Industrial forklift and warehouse

- Infrastructure and smart city

- Sidewalk and last-mile delivery

- UAV mapping and navigation

Engineered to be an optimal automotive-grade lidar solution for autonomous vehicles, Velabit can fill sensing gaps, helping automakers achieve full coverage around a vehicle. The sensor enables robust perception coverage for autonomous driving and other features including Blind-Spot Monitoring, Cross-Traffic Detection, and Pedestrian Automatic Emergency Braking

2021-06-15 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$ELY DD – Round 2. Combined Valuation of Callaway and Topgolf $ELY (Callaway Golf + Topgolf) has done well so far, up 40% YTD, and currently had a market cap of $6.3B.  My initial DD showed how popular Topgolf has been, and how they are almost always completed booked up.  Despite the run-up this year, I still believe ELY is undervalued, especially when you look at Callaway and Topgolf separately.  
  
Callaway (excl. Topgolf) vs Acushnet (ticker $GOLF).  
Q1 Revenue: ELY $559M vs GOLF $581M  
Q1 EBITDA: ELY $113M vs GOLF $135M  
Qtr over QTR revenue Growth: ELY +26% vs GOLF +42%  
  
$GOLF’s current market cap is $3.7B, and due to higher EBITDA margin and higher growth rate, I am assuming $ELY would trade at a 15% discount to GOLF.  **Therefore $ELY (excl. Topgolf) worth ~$3.1B.**
  
Topgolf:  Pre-pandemic, Topgolf IPO valuation was estimated to be $4B.  On the last earnings call, CEO said he expects “the Topgolf business to meet or exceed its 2019 full-year results”.  They’ve opened 5 new venues so far this year, with 3 more to open later this year, so I think CEO is being conservative around Topgolf full year forecast.  Additionally, TopTracer installed 1,533 bays in Q1, putting total bays over 10,000.  CEO said they are on tracke to install 8,000 bays for the full year.  Now this isn’t a big $ amount, online says they cost $2k for a year, but I believe it is indicative of the strong growth we will see from Topgolf overall.  Based on my assumption that Topgolf will easily surpass 2019 results, **I believe Topgolf is worth ~$4.5B.**  
  
I’m not even factoring the synergies from selling Callaway products at Topgolf, or the cost synergies from the merger.  **But just adding up both valuations: Callaway $3.1B + Topgolf $4.5B = $7.1B market cap.  It’s currently at $6.3B, so 20% upside.  Price target is $41/share.**  
  
**Position: $ELY 1,000 shares; 40C Aug 20 at $35 strike.**  From my previous post, I sold my May call options for a nice profit, and have now gone back for more.  Holding shares long term.

2021-06-15 10:05:42,wallstreetbets,"I’m sitting on 1000 shares at $30 avg cost.  I think I might just hold them forever.

I think that the Topgolf by itself is worth $20B - full stop.  As you mentioned in your DD, they are always packed and their customers drop fucking mountains of cash.  I have personally never gone and spent less than $150 per person.

I had a buddy tell me he went to a bachelor party several weeks ago in Vegas and had to beg, borrow, and steal to get a bay at the location on the strip.  ON THE FUCKING VEGAS STRIP! Where there are so many options for bachelor party degenerates to go! 

I conservatively think that every NFL City could support 3-10 Topgolf locations.  They even recently opened a location in Waco freaking Texas which I’ve heard it is also jam packed, so even tertiary cities have demand potential.

To pair that, I’m only casually into golf as a sport, but my wife and I are absolutely down to go anytime we’re invited by friends or family.

Callaway also benefits from every Topgolf location acting as a retail location for their offerings, especially higher margin products such as custom club fittings.

I believe it was the CEO of Callaway that said that Topgolf is the biggest thing to happen to golf since Tiger Woods.

I tend to agree"

**TLDR:**

* Much more than a boomer value stock.
* Solid fundamentals, but who gives a shit. Has nice DDs.
* New [Big Dick CEO](https://bgfoods.com/investor-relations/news/article/14091/) starts *today*. He's literally led a company to Mars. Before that he was the overlord of tendies dipping sauces at Heinz.
* Priced at a discount to its peers, with significant Q2 and Q3 upside potential.
* Passes [the SMELL test](https://www.reddit.com/user/pennyether/comments/nzd2zi/whats_that_smell/): 2nd highest SI of dividend stocks (BBBY is #1), low liquidity, low IV.
* It cums with the meme stocks. Basically like BBBY but IV = 40% instead of 110%.
* Sloppy seconds short squeeze potential: 1) growth-to-value rotation *or* 2) meme stocks squeeze again.
* Runs [a brothel](https://bgfoods.com/brands/): Green Giant, Skinny Girl, Mama Mary's, Crisco, Cream of Wheat, etc.
* This is not financial advice and don't buy shit if the IV is through the roof.

# Preface

This post comes to you after after discovering [the SMELL test](https://www.reddit.com/user/pennyether/comments/nzd2zi/whats_that_smell/) which lead to WWE opening her legs at +10%, climaxing at +25%, and cuddling to +11% at close.  All this on a day with zero news, except my one [moderately successful WSB post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nvcyxf/wwe_can_you_smell_what_the_stock_is_cooking/).

WWE's IV of 35% implied a 2.2% stddev in daily price change... so an 11% close represents a 5 sigma event. My take is that WWE got pregnant after getting fucked by WSB wearing *five* condoms. I think MMs got defensive by pumping up the ask and IVs during PM, possibly due to seeing sentiment pop. (Unfortunately, it didn't take WWE long to start showing pregnancy sickness -- she regurgitated some gains in the last couple of days.)

WWE definitely came, and so did I. My FDs were up 2500%, and Jan LEAPs up 250%. However, in an act of sheer horniness after spending all day furiously writing the DD, I had posted it after close. So only those able to get in at open were able to appreciate the climax. **I'm not making that mistake this time.**

## My point is: if you're looking for a broad who is so fertile that even a modest amount of WSB autist-sperm can knock her up a few points, then go for a SMELLy broad... they get knocked up easily.

In this case, I'm going gay and hoping BGS's [Green Giant](https://bgfoods.com/brands/green-giant) shows us more of his giant green cock. The fun doesn't stop there.. he'll bring along [Ass-Clapper Girl](https://bgfoods.com/brands/clabber-girl/), some [anorexic bitch](https://bgfoods.com/brands/skinnygirl-dressings/), a [certified MILF](https://bgfoods.com/brands/mama-marys/), and hell, even [Grandma](https://bgfoods.com/brands/grandmas/)! They'll even bring some [Crisco](https://bgfoods.com/brands/crisco/) \-- anything to make you [cream](https://bgfoods.com/brands/cream-of-wheat/) or have a [perfect release](https://bgfoods.com/brands/bakers-joy/). If the thrill of evading the law is more your thing, they can bring along [some](https://bgfoods.com/brands/ortega/) [illegal](https://bgfoods.com/brands/buena-vida/) [immigrants](https://bgfoods.com/brands/las-palmas/), too.

The Aristocrats aside, BGS's **S**hort interest, **M**arket cap, **L**ow IV, and **L**iquidity make it one SMELLy bitch. As for **F**undamentals, I think they're solid. She's got a good heart, but who the fuck cares about that when she's got lovely DDs? Besides, ""f"" can't be jammed into a clever acronym. (Ok, I'm a softy and I actually care and I've included some fundamentals in this post.)

Add to that some aphrodisiacs:

* [New big dick CEO](https://bgfoods.com/investor-relations/news/article/14091/) that deployed a turnaround story literally to Mars, prior to that he led Heinz's tendies dipping sauce team.
* Q2 guidance teabagged the stock, so a surprise beat is very possible. Same for Q3.
* Market Tailwinds: ""growth to value"" pick, should the trend continue. High divs, underpriced wrt peers.
* Correlates with other squeeze stocks... is it still open season on shorts or nah?
* Options are cheap as fuck (IV = 41%).

...aaaaaand I'm hard.

Alright. Enough foreplay. Let's get sniffing.

# I. A Brief History of B&G

The [full history](https://bgfoods.com/about/history/) of this perverted company is actually quite interesting, probably, if you read it. I didn't read it, I just mostly looked at the pictures:

* In 1822 some Englishman started a condiment business in Boston in 1822, most likely to pay for the most advanced oral cosmetics of the day.
* He then sells canned goods to Union troops.
* That guy dies, but his freaky perverted goth sons takes over and make a deal with the devil to sell some unholy canned mixture of ground ham and ""special"" seasonings.
* By 1889 two of these perverts become street walkers in Manhattan selling pickles by yelling ""get yer edible green dildos, here!"" from a horse and buggy.
* In 1893 they they latch onto the BBC trend, and offer the not so subtle ""Cream of Wheat""
* While all this is going on, Mama Ortega squeezes out 13 kids, the 11th one establishes the ""Ortega"" brand.
* I guess the freaky sons decided it a good idea to conglomerate a huge harem of the freakiest sounding brand names. Something about bagel chips too.
* The rest is history!

In short, B&G has a solid history of selling phallic foods and acquiring [euphemistic memeable brands](https://bgfoods.com/brands/) to create some sort of weird food brothel:

* Green Giant
* Cream of Wheat
* Crisco
* Skinny Girl
* Clabber Girl
* Baker's Joy
* Moma Mary's
* Grandma's
* Accent Flavor Enhancer

A true hags to riches story, this pimp of a company posted a record of $505m in Q1 sales, even in the face of supply shortages.

# II. Fundamentals

## Comps

First, let's head to the red light district and do some window shopping:

You can see BGS is trading at a significant discount to her peers.

Why?

Well, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. One take is past company leadership hasn't been strong in developing and executing plans for growth or evolution of the company. They paid an unnecessarily high dividend at times (at various points it was a double digit % dividend), and prior management decided to accrue debt to complete deals even as it continued to pay high dividends.

They're also being shorted.

Their business is solid, though. From my perspective, I see a librarian with some light acne but with deep set sexual perversions just waiting for the right chad to unleash her. She's got nothing wrong with her, but she can't really sexually express herself comfortably -- until now she's just been dating some lazy ass cuck that can't find the clit.

Basically: It’s easier to fix broken management decisions quickly than to fix a broken underlying business. In BGS you have the former rather than the latter.

So how exactly will management get fixed?

## New CEO

Enter Kenneth ""Clit Killer"" Keller. Announced May 11th just before the Q1 earnings call, and starts this very day. Mans can find the clit.

You can read [the bio](https://bgfoods.com/investor-relations/news/article/14091/), or just get erect right now:

**☑ M&A of a larger, high growth business**

>Most recently, Mr. Keller served as president and CEO of JDE Peet’s NV, a $7 billion global coffee and tea company with over 20,000 employees based in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. He led the merger of Jacobs Douwe Egberts (JDE) and Peet’s Coffee, Inc. and the successful initial public offering of the combined company in May 2020.

**☑ Has literally led a company to Mars.** **☑ Can deliver a turnaround.**

>Prior to that, Mr. Keller served as global president of the Wm. Wrigley Jr. Company, a subsidiary of Mars, Inc., where he was responsible for delivering sales and profit growth across the global gum, mints and candy business. In the United States, the company’s largest global market, Mr. Keller led a turnaround of the Wrigley business, delivering growth well above the industry average. During the integration of Wrigley into Mars, Mr. Keller helped establish the global business units and strategy for the combined Mars-Wrigley confectionery business

**☑ Former overlord of tendies dipping sauces.**

>He also worked at the H.J. Heinz Company in both the United States and Europe, leading the ketchup, condiments and sauces division in the United States

This guy has a solid track record of both turning around and growing companies that deal with packages that consumers put in their mouths (packaged foods, that is). It's a great sign he chose BGS for his next gig.

## Q1 earnings, Q2 guidance

First a reminder that this company absolutely crushed it during the start of COVID, where doomsday prepping of canned and frozen goods took hold. So, YoY comparisons were tough to beat. But beat them off it did.

Net sales in Q1 rose to $505, from $449m last year, despite it being a tough comparison. The Crisco acquisition and strong net sales in the Spices and Seasonings brand area of $24.6 (47.5% Y/Y growth) more than offsetting reductions in Green Giant and other areas due to supply constraints (demand substantially exceeded supply -- a problem we all wish we had).

E-commerce pimpery of their products increased by 60% Q1 '20 vs Q1 '21 to $50m. They expect it to grow to $250m for full year '21, and are focused on growing that aspect of the business. They also have the option to put Skinny Girl on OF, though it wasn't mentioned in the call.

The guidance for Q2? They're limited by supply, costs have risen, and last year's Q2 '20 will be difficult to top due to people stuffing their ~~panties~~ pantries. **This is very likely priced in,** as management was quite conservative on their earnings call and transparent about the supply issues, which aren't particularly severe to begin with. It's a good problem to have.

[Further evidence this is priced in](https://www.barrons.com/articles/campbell-and-b-g-foods-have-outperformed-only-one-is-a-buy-for-this-analyst-51616436465):

>By contrast, he downgraded B&G Foods (BGS) to Neutral from Overweight, while maintaining a $31 price target. Lavery writes that he finds it difficult to see upside to the stock’s current valuation, especially as commodity-price inflation could lead to higher costs in the second half of this year and into 2022. That said, the company does have some ability to counteract this, like Campbell, via moves like hedging and price increases; even so, he estimates that B&G Foods could face between 15% and 25% earnings per share risk this year—and next—if current commodity prices hold.

## Addressing Risks

Analysts are treating BGS like it has ED, but **Green Giant is a grower not a shower**.

BGS' supply chain and sales are primarily integrated across US, Canada, and Mexico vs many peers' more geographically dispersed sourcing and sales. BGS is thus well-insulated against global geopolitical/market trends toward de-globalization and global supply chain disruption risk, and has less exposure to ongoing COVID disruption due to North America's head start on vaccination and reopening.

They also have a strong history and relationship sourcing their inputs, which should give them an edge over private brands that will struggle to source competitively in a supply environment that's tighter than your wife's hot friends.

In short, anything they can source is sold, they're fuck buddies with COVID-proof and reliable growers, and as industry costs rise they can price better than the smaller off-brand competitors.

Given the worst is priced in, a good growing season is all it would take for a significant impact on the share price.

# III. Macro Tailwinds and Catalysts

## On COVID:

* COVID lead to an unfortunate decline in eating out (pun intended, obviously). The upside to that is now consumers are slightly more apt at throwing frozen vegetables in the microwave. I expect that post-COVID people will remain more self-sufficient, and thus the demand for packaged goods will hopefully not decline much.
* Even if the above is wrong: BGS's foodservice sales, which took an ass pounding from COVID, saw the beginnings of an uptick in March. This corresponds to the start of general reopening across the US as vaccine availability accelerated. Foodservice were still at pre-COVID levels in Q1, so Q2 should capture much more of that recovery, which might surprise in terms of speed and scale.
* To the extent that people keep their COVID purchasing habits: As mentioned before: BGS e-commerce purchasing of their products increased by 60% Q1 '20 vs Q1 '21 to $50m. They expect it to grow to $250m for full year '21, and are focused on growing that aspect of the business.

## On the Growth to Value rotation:

* A further market shift from growth to value would be welcomed. BGS had no performance anxiety during COVID and offers a **6.3% yield**, and has authorized a **50m stock repurchase program**.
* On the related subject of interest rates possibly rising: While they do have debt, they have limited exposure. The majority of their long-term debt, $1.45b is fixed-rate vs $906m variable rate.

## Possible Catalysts:

* As mentioned above, growth-to-value swing would really butter the biscuit.
* If we see early signs of persistent COVID outbreaks, or vaccine-resistant variants, there will be another rush on BGS products. Also, as a stock BGS has proved resilient and a surprise upside performer, so it will be high on the list of defensive stocks.
* Q2 earnings
* Good crops of veggies throughout rest of year.
* A short squeeze occurring from growth-to-value rotation
* A short squeeze occurring in meme stocks (see below)

# IV. Technicals

## BGS SMELL Test

[You can read about my SMELL test here.](https://www.reddit.com/user/pennyether/comments/nzd2zi/whats_that_smell/)

>SMELL is my proprietary system scientifically engineered to maximize fear in the hearts of wall street. I identify tickers that have low liquidity (eg, their price moves up a lot per unit of inflow), but also have short interest and low implied volatility. I theorize this maximizes the chance that a squeeze or defensive posture by MMs happens, should a sustained inflow of capital occur. The result is, in theory, that buying inflows will lead to faster share price movements and rapid increases in IVs -- basically that options print.

* **S**hort Interest: Exchange Reported: 25% float (May 28), Ortex: 22% (Jun 8).
* **M**arket Cap: $2.14B
* **E**xtremely Memeable: Green Giant. Crisco. Cream of Wheat.
* **L**ow Liquidity: Avg Daily Volume: 1.18M shs ($39m), 1.8 % Market Cap, 72% inst ownership
* **L**ow IV: \~40%

Smells good to me. I like the 72% inst. ownership, as well.

## Boomer Fundamentals, Meme Price Action

I didn't really see this ticker mentioned back in Jan, or during this squeeze cycle, but take a look here:

[It tracks with the memes, like BBBY](https://preview.redd.it/2648ua3pu9571.png?width=1560&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ad31751c0d6634ac6fa8745ec435b6be14a4885)

It looks like BGS likes getting groped just as much as the other memes. If/when a squeeze happens to the others, I'm betting that BGS rears its Green Giant Cock again. This is with zero catalysts -- I didn't find any [posts for BGS](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/search/?q=bgs+flair%3Add&sort=top&restrict_sr=on&t=all) on or around Jun 2, when it last popped. So, most likely, this pop comes from short books being stressed elsewhere. This is good.

**In fact, BGS is the second highest shorted dividend stock.** First place? BBBY, which currently has an IV of 106%. Compare that to BGS's IV of 40%. Yeah, I'll be taking some LEAPs and seeing how squeeze season plays out.

The conclusion here: If meme season doesn't squeeze BGS, there's the possibility of sloppy seconds coming from growth-to-value rotation.

SI Peaked in mid May (before/during earnings), and has been tapering off as:

* Perhaps they fear the new CEO
* Squeeze season comes into full swing

One of those will certainly continue, and the other is to be determined.

# V. DeltaFlux (gamma/charm/vanna)

Let's head over to the deltaflux tables. I like to look at the options chain of tickers to approximate if/how deltahedging is likely to have an effect.

## Notes

In my personal experience, gamma (1% price flux) values of >0.30% float are significant, and I'm surprised to see them given that the option chain seems pretty sparse. I imagine more OI would extend this ramp significantly. It's also nice that vanna (10% IV flux) is currently positive. My read is that short term movement to $35.00 is easily possible.

2.75% of float currently deltahedged is a nothing burger. It's not tying up much float, and so I don't suspect the current option chain is subtracting from liquidity -- but I think liquidity is low to begin with. Of course, if OI blows up, this number is likely to skyrocket as well.

What's exciting to me is the % avg volume -- I'd consider >4.00% to be pretty sizeable, and we're waaaay past that. If one were to believe that average volume were indicative of liquidity, then deltahedging could certainly start pushing the share price around, should it naturally move up (or down).

For reference, here are some other tickers' current peak values:

|Ticker|% DeltaHedged|1% price flux % Float|1% price flux % Avg Vol|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**BGS**|2.75%|0.30%|11.43%|
|WWE (before pop)|19.19%|0.14%|5.75%|
|BBBY|6.74%|0.43%|4.55%|
|CLNE|11.10%|0.26%|0.65%|
|CLOV|28.38%|0.82%|0.27%|
|AMC|23.75%|0.25%|0.42%|
|GME|18.38%|0.39%|1.50%|

# VI. Positions and Closing Remarks

I see significant upside:

* Short Term: If squeeze season is still in effect, this currently tracks with meme stocks like BBBY. This is all without any significant coverage on WSB. If near-term rotation-to-value occurs, there is likely some upside there as well.
* Mid Term: Q2 guidance was conservative, and I believe the downside is priced in. Given that, a surprise Q2 is a major possibility. A slower rotation from growth to value would also work. BGS has a juicy dividend and is priced at a discount to its peers.
* Long Term: New CEO started **today**. Proven track record. For the foreseeable future, BGS will be limited only by supply, and not demand. I have faith on their ability to execute -- great relationships with suppliers and competitive pricing. Can reach price commensurate with its peers.

I think downside is priced in, given some analysts did some scat play with it due to supply concerns.

Other things I like:

* Passes the SMELL test
* Options are dirt cheap
* Green Giant, Crisco, Cream of Wheat

## Don't YOLO, etc

None of this is financial advice. Don't go crazy with this and don't blame me if it doesn't moon. If share price or IV spike, then wait for a better entry or the next opportunity.

## My positions

I'm playing a little bit of everything. Yes, I have a lot of different calls, but this isn't a YOLO. It's about 5% of my options book.

* 10% - Jun: $35 - Betting on miracle spike like with WWE.
* 30% - Jul: $35, $37.50, $40 - Betting on squeeze season carrying BGS, and/or growth-to-value rotation.
* 30% - Aug: $35, $37.50, $40 - Betting on Q2 blowout and/or growth-to-value rotation.
* 20% - Jan: $35 - Betting long term CEO, Q2 and/or Q3 blowout. Valuation approaches that of peers.
* 10% - Chance your wife has an STD"
2021-06-15 02:20:09,wallstreetbets,BGS will probably gap up 10% today.

I may be a smooth-brained ape but even I figured out how to make Taco Bell-like burritos at home.   
Here's a quick recipe:  
Mix homemade rice with Queso and salsa. Add whatever your favorite meat/vegetable is. Wrap it up in a soft tortilla shell. Put some nice taco sauce in/over it.  
Pretty sure Green Giant/Ortega makes 4 out of the 6 ingredients that I just mentioned and I now buy every week."

2021-06-15 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"AMD - constantly outperforming, constantly undervalued? 
**Basics**

As long as you haven't been living under a fucking rock for the last decade, you know that AMD is a major player in electronic devices. While it has a minority hold in its markets, it still has a considerable market share AND has a hand in both GPUs and CPUs. It's versatile.

While the silicon shortage is still big and doesn't show any signs of slowing, AMD is still most likely making a shitload of profit from the continuous buyouts of graphics cards for mining and the continuous selling of CPUs.

**EPS/Financial history**

AMD has been continuously crushing quarterly earnings targets for at least the past year, and shows no signs of slowing. It has consistently maintained a steady and rising profit.

[Constantly winning](https://preview.redd.it/qz0qs58rh9571.png?width=332&format=png&auto=webp&s=d615f35e833c3563f23d4de50afe3956f490d61b)

On top of this, the company has a total cash balance of 3.12 billion and a total debt of only 551 million, which is fucking great.

[It's doing great with managing its debt and total cash to say the least](https://preview.redd.it/vh2sh5xai9571.png?width=422&format=png&auto=webp&s=61451edd2ef36120f80b83aefbfbce123fe2813e)

Not made up your mind yet? If not, I have even more great news for you! The company has been constantly underestimated/undervalued despite all these great numbers. The past 6 months have been shit which isn't to say it's been terrible in the long run which it definitely has not, but for a company that holds so much market in two major component categories at both the business and consumer level it's ridiculous for the stock to be consistently falling.

[Constantly going down](https://preview.redd.it/j2pavto0j9571.png?width=434&format=png&auto=webp&s=26816d6c905488484879bc98f527d8ac15accef9)

**Shorts and shares**

The company is decently shorted with around 7% of the shares being shorted for a company with a solid background, which could be a disaster waiting to happen. Again, it's not heavily shorted by any means but I don't think 7% is something to scoff at.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Memeablility**

Now that we've gone over all the boring numbers, let's talk about the memability of the company. It's a fucking computer parts company. Computers=gaming, gaming=memes. It's simple logic.

&#x200B;

**More general points**

AMD has a solid community reputation, and while the performance its components put out is not on par with that of nvidia and intel, the products are generally more user/consumer friendly and cheaper, plus not everyone is looking to buy an RTX 6090 with liquid shit cooling built in for the unaffordable price of a kidney. AMD is geared more towards the average consumer which makes up a large portion of the computer market. Not only this but AMD chips are appearing more and more in laptops and pre-built computers. Another small point is that Microsoft is using AMD chips in their new generation of Xbox.

Again, all of this is speculation and I'm not telling anyone what decision to make, this is just my take on it."
2021-06-14 21:06:36,wallstreetbets,How do you post DD on AMD being undervalued without mention of the pending xlnx merger. The reason they are undervalued is because they are being shorted by the hedges who then go buy xlnx shares for the value of the converted xlnx stock post merger.
2021-06-14 21:26:32,wallstreetbets,AMD is being held down because of merger arbitrage with XLNK. They short AMD and buy XLNK. There was some really solid DD posted about it a couple days ago

First of all, I wouldn't buy either at todays price, I like to get a good deal and neither fit my personal qualifications today. They being said at the current price I see more value in Intel. We're both entitled to our opinion however I said why I think Intel is a better buy, what exactly makes you feel this way for AMD?"
2021-06-15 12:24:08,wallstreetbets,"It's always hard to nail the top/bottom but I definately feel like the AMD charts are reversing long term. Hard to say, it's done me well I will prob unload this week."
2021-06-15 10:19:39,wallstreetbets,The marlek share of AMD in the x86 Market is already worthy of calling it a duopoly in my eyes. There are a lot of reasons leading to the marketshare and I believed to have seen them in advance. And a Company taking significant marketshare from a big market is a good reason to buy.
2021-06-15 13:52:40,wallstreetbets,"Because AMD is going to generate massive profit on Epyc sales for the next two years.  Well in excess of analyst estimates.  They're going to make massive market share gains.  I don't think analysts expect them to go much beyond 30% of that market, and I fully expect them to get closer to 70% in 2 years time.

AMDs consumer chips will be in short supply now for a long time, because they are devoting fab allocation to Epyc to satisfy that sales channel."
2021-06-15 12:27:18,wallstreetbets,Yep I wouldn't sweat 100% optimal timing since it's impossible.  But I don't see AMD having another qualitatively higher peak any time soon without major new growth opportunities.
2021-06-15 10:33:16,wallstreetbets,"The last point is def untrue. Investing in a company because you believe they could take significant marketshare is a good reason, not because they've already done it. A good buy is in anticipation of growth, not after it already occurred."
2021-06-15 10:47:25,wallstreetbets,"Yes. I was talking about my decision in 2018. And now I still see reasons for future market share gains in both CPU, GPU consumer and enterprise markets. I don't trust Intels projections as they failed to deliver in the past. I trust in TSMCs strength and TSMCs strategic interest in growing its TAM through AMD which is fableds taking away marketshare from Intel which is a fab (and soon foundry and then even direct competition tp tsmc). I believe that the high prices will partially remain after the shortage because people get used to high prices.I believe in a growing market. We will see if I am right :)"

2021-06-15 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"There Will Be Blood And I'm trying to be Daniel Plainview and not Eli (Cathie Woods) getting smashed over the head with a bowling pin. I believe that Oil will be a great play for this summer as a result of a unique combination of macroeconomic trends. 

Inflation is here, climbing to its highest rate since 2008. And
as the U.S dollar continues to decline, we've seen oil reach the highest levels in years. The smartest thing that Nixon ever did was make the U.S dollar the world currency for oil. And therefore, as the dollar has declined, it has contributed to the increase in oil prices. 

However, another big factor is the increased mobility as a result of re-opening and vaccinations. Activity levels as measured by mobility have resumed their upward trajectory. In addition, we will likely see a seasonal upswing in transportation, manufacturing, and construction that accelerates into June especially if the transporataion/infrastructure bill proposed by the Biden adminstration passes. 

https://imgur.com/a/Lw8TKad

The likely reason why the future demand for oil and its increase on prices hasn't been priced in yet is because ""that commodities must price to equate the physical volume demand and supply in the market today – they cannot be forward-looking like
equities. Stocks must be drawn down before a commodity scarcity premium –backwardation – can be sustained. If time spreads become backwardated in anticipation of future scarcity and tighter inventories, the current physical surplus would be pulled
out of inventory and sold against the higher prompt prices, pushing the market back to where it started. Only physical scarcity can sustain backwardation, and importantly, backwardation is now in over half of all commodity markets (image below). This move toward backwardation across the complex also indicates a lack of inventories required to limit such rallies as physical markets get tighter. Precisely because commodities depend upon the level of demand, and only the level of demand exceeding the level of supply can create a physical scarcity premium in markets, can we be confident that sustained backwardation is showing us how commodity markets are becoming progressively tighter today.""

https://imgur.com/4NarTLA

Essentailly what they're saying is, when COVID hit, OPEC and oil companies in general were forced to stop spending on CAPEX and cut supply drastically. Now, as demand continues to grow for oil, these same companies and facilites will not have enough supply to meet the demand because the operational rigs have decreased as a result of the lack of investment.

Puts me right at a million bucks profit if we can get there before end of summer. Anything short of that will still be strong gains. Looks like $63 is next resistance level once it breaks $50. 

My theory is they knew the oil crisis was coming and the child tax credits were planned for this. When those roll out 7/15, they’ll be touted as the cushion to support families when gas hits $5+/gallon. Putin wants $200/barrel and Saudi Arabia needs $75/barrel just to break even.

https://www.westerndigital.com/solutions/automotive-transportation

> The automotive and transportation industries are on the cusp of a disruptive technology phase. Vehicles are not simply mechanical engines but are now data centers on wheels, driving a new generation of storage infrastructure needs. As cars become connected and autonomous, massive amounts of data are being created and consumed. This requires new approaches in data processing that improve communications and interactions between humans and vehicles, vehicles and vehicles (V2V), and vehicles and infrastructures (V2I), while enabling a better and safer driving experience. This places massive demands on data storage and processing at the edge while pushing the boundaries of cloud-based services in the core.

What we didn't expect was CHIA driving up the costs of traditional HDD storage. HD prices are going to end up going parabolic the way miners have strangled the shit out of the GPU space, driving gaming enthuiasts to desperation lengths and overpaying for GPUs. Just look at NVDA's price run over the last month.

The run-up for the storage sector is lagging but following the trend as Seagate (7/27) and WDC (7/28) prepare for ER next month. There will be a significant surge (5-10%) over the next week. Analysts have already lifted price targets; guessing this closes around $80 at the end of June. Easy weekly skimmings.

Fortunately it seems like there are a few solid picks swirling around, one of them being WELL health $WELL $WLLYF. 

WELL is one of the top providers of digital health services and is severely underrated considering its insane potential for growth. there are a couple key points making this so appealing. 

#1 Billionaire Investors. 
With direct investment from the 30th richest man in the world, Li Ka-shing, WELL has been buying up the competition with multiple 9-digit Acquisitions this year positioning WELL as the largest operator of digital health clinics in the country. In a space with such high barriers to entry, political power is king like we saw with Clover.

#2 NASDAQ listing. 
WELL recently announced their partnership with renowned law firm Fenwick & West, which helped companies like Facebook, Amazon, Cisco, and Coinbase with their IPOs. This is important because WELL’s equivalents in the US are currently trading at much higher multiples making this a unique opportunity to catch the rocket before it leaves."

However, after the market popped this morning, shooting the IV and premiums way up, I've decided to roll that money into more ASO calls. Similar metrics, but hasn't gone off yet. What do y'all think? Seems like more upside combined with a stable investment.

There's lots of great DD on ASO out there already, I highly recommend checking it out.

IMO, buying ASO now could be like buying CRSR a month or two ago. But I do want to hear everyone's opinions. Are you still going to be buying CRSR or looking for the next big thing?

If not ASO, I'm somewhat interested in F, M, and BMBL. My BMBL calls made over 45% today so far (the underlying stock has jumped 7% and is over $51 at the moment), so I'm started to get pretty excited about that one.

People who are familiar with the financial industry know that in his market operations, wisdom and DDs, Paul TJ is somehow the brother of Michael Burry.

So lets listen carefully to his words:

“Today only 0.75% is invested in commodities compared to a 1.55% historically. And because most asset managers are actually stupid and beliefe that inflation will be transitory, you also have a massive short in the commodity complex. A massive short. ... What happens if the reddit crowd ever gets into commodities? Commodities are finite supply. Small markets. God forbid if the bullies of the financial markets ever take this on.“

You can listen to his own words here: https://youtu.be/tgAV64RoPsw

PTJ is smart and exactly on point: If we would actually moon commodities we would force inflation and break the Feds irresponsible monetary policy. This story would be larger than  GME — by far.

Compare growth to HAL and SLB (the other 2 service majors). The street is discrediting their diversification of end markets and does not believe it should correlate with O&G space. >85% of revenue is O&G? This is a classic mispricing and I believe the intrinsic value to be closer to $44-45 based on low debt leverage and low/medium growth assumption. We saw BKR was very nimble through covid, it is poised to experience tremendous price appreciation if valued properly. Keep in mind half of the services companies went under during covid leaving soo much business out there for the majors to take….

It’s trading down because of management teams selling? During earning season? Havnt people learned that there’s timelines and requirements to exercise these contracts. It’s not fundamental whatsoever. Unbelievable buying opportunity.

2021-06-14 20:46:25,wallstreetbets,"It will be dilutive. However, the impact of the dilution should be far outweighed by the benefit of the agreement. Amazon will need to purchase $500m of fuel for several tranches of the warrants to vest. For a $2.3b market cap company, that is huge. Plus buy-in from Amazon is priceless for public sentiment about RNG

Additionally, would encourage you to read the BoD's rationale for why they think shareholders should approve the share issuance in connection with the Amazon agreement (which they did approve today):

&#x200B;

*Our Board determined, in its business judgment, that the transactions with Amazon as described above, including the issuance of the Amazon Warrant, and the possible future purchase by Amazon Holdings of the Warrant Shares issuable thereunder, are in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders. Our Board approved these transactions, subject to any required stockholder approval, and recommends that our stockholders vote in favor of this Proposal 4. In making this determination and approval, the Board considered, among other things, the factors and characteristics of the transactions described below.*

  
*First and most critically, the Board believes Amazon is a valuable strategic partner for Clean Energy.* ***Under the Fuel Agreement, Amazon will be purchasing low and negative carbon RNG from Clean Energy, initially through 27 existing fueling stations and 19 non-exclusive new or upgraded stations that we expect to construct by the end of the year. The new and existing stations will provide RNG in 15 different states across the United States, and we will own all the stations.***

  
*The Warrant Shares vest in multiple tranches, the first of which for 13,283,445 Warrant Shares vested upon execution of the Fuel Agreement. Subsequent tranches will vest over time based on fuel purchases by Amazon and its affiliates, up to a total of $500 million, excluding any payments attributable to “Pass Through Costs,” which consist of all costs associated with the delivered cost of gas and applicable taxes determined by reference to the selling price, gallons or gas sold.* ***Importantly, if all the vesting conditions of the Amazon Warrant are satisfied, Amazon will have purchased hundreds of millions of GGEs of RNG at today’s fuel prices from Clean Energy.***

  
***We believe a commercial partnership with Amazon will enhance our strategies, initiatives and efforts to achieve our goals to grow fleet and other consumer support for the use of RNG as a vehicle fuel for our target customers and geographies, and other contributions and factors.*** *The Board also believes the proceeds from the issuance of our common stock to Amazon in the event Amazon were to vest and then exercise the Amazon Warrant in part or whole for cash, would enhance our liquidity in support of our operations, as well as our ability to execute our business plans and pursue opportunities for further growth.*"
2021-06-14 21:28:46,wallstreetbets,"I don't think anyone is arguing that this an ideal form of fuel. But it is a large step better then drilling for oil. And, for better or worse, most people in this thread are probably less concerned with the climate and more concerned with the profitability of this company."
2021-06-14 21:25:50,wallstreetbets,"RNG isn't going to magically solve the climate crisis but do you realize the RNG that CLNE produces is carbon negative? They're using biogenic methane that would otherwise go into the atmosphere and making fuel for Amazon's fleet that would otherwise be running on gas. 

That's a big YEP for me."

2021-06-15 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"MINDMED(MNMD) BIG MONEY COMING IN 💵🚀💰 As a lot of you guys may already know, MINDMED was mentioned in the reconstitution of Russell 3000. 

Institutional holdings are gradually increasing, and in 3 weeks it went from .62 to .67 which is around 8% increase in institutional holdings. 


MINDMED will officially be added to the index on JUNE 25th. In the upcoming weeks holdings are gonna keep on increasing and I believe institutional holdings will be above .8 (20% increase) in just a few months. 

In February, before the stock was uplisted to NASDAQ the stock peaked at $4.20, and in December the stock peaked around $4.37. The only reason it went down was because market looked like it was about to undergo a correction. Again this was before Nasdaq uplist, and before it was added to Russell 3000. 
. 

What catalyst are people waiting for?? They're waiting on FDA approval for for LSD and their patented chemicals. The FDA already granted breakthrough therapy status for psilocybin therapy. LSD and PSILOCYBIN are the SAME THING!! Lsd just lasts longer. Most psychedelics are safe to use, and MINDMED will definitely pass FDA approval for AT LEAST ONE OF their patented chemicals as they have multiple trials going for them. 


More and more states are pushing for decriminalization of psychedelics. California passed a bill to legalize psychedelics for adults. A New York lawmaker introduced a bill on June 1st that would require the state to establish an institute to research the therapeutic potential of psychedelics. EVEN the nations capital DC passed a bill for the decriminalization of shrooms. 

A psychedelic REVOLUTION is upon us and the SHROOM BOOM will happen soon. 

Currently the MINDMED trades at 3.70 and I believe by the end of the year its gonna be above $5, because of increase in institutional holdings, anticipation of FDA approval, and I just like the stock.

2021-06-15 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Ocugen - massivly undervalued Back in December, Ocugen was a penny stock trading for as little as $0.28. However, its shares skyrocketed after it announced a partnership with India's Bharat Biotech to commercialize its coronavirus vaccine in the U.S. As a result, shareholders who bought Ocugen stock for literal pennies on Dec. 1 are now up a mouthwatering 3,320% on their investment. Is now a safe time to invest in this biotech?


A top-tier coronavirus vaccine

Bharat Biotech's COVAXIN is composed of inactivated virions (ineffective viruses outside of host cells). It differentiates itself from other vaccines in its ability to protect against multiple viral antigens. During an interim phase 3 analysis, 78% of patients who received two doses of the vaccine developed immunity against mild, moderate, or severe cases of COVID-19. Additionally, the vaccine protected 100% of patients against severe COVID-19.
Of particular interest is the location of the clinical study. Being conducted in India, patients saw exposure to the new mutant COVID-19 strains circulating in the country. The B.1.617 strain is at least 20% transmissible and 50% more resistant to antibodies than the original COVID-19 strain. It's very impressive that COVAXIN maintained its efficacy. The vaccine is also simple to transport because it can last up to three months at room temperature.
COVAXIN is authorized for use in India, where about 300 million doses have been supplied to date. To make it available in the U.S., Bharat Biotech has solicited the help of Ocugen. The latter estimates it will secure emergency use authorization (EUA) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) by the end of June.
My prediction - 15 dollars by september.

For what little its worth on this forum, they're an exceptionally well run miner with a superb eye for value acquisitions and efficient management. They were a gold miner in South Africa, a higher cost environment than competitors, so had to run more efficiently to break even, it came time to re-invest and they moved to platinum, which unlike gold is best mined in SA, buying in at the very bottom of the market and turning it all around. They're also 50% owner of DRDGold which processes old ore trailings, currently only gold, but their ceo says their partnership has only scratched the surface and with how it is only a matter of time before that tech can be applied to PGM trailings, I believe it.

I think platinum group metals are about to go on a run, soon, because we have a global new car shortage and when these factories all start making new cars 24/7 when they've been riddled with production problems, demand for PGMs from catalytic converters will go through the roof. There's been a lot of excess platinum production from 2014-18 that's been slowly getting burned off and current platinum production is a bit below demand. There's a big time delay between supply and demand, so when mines in 2014 were opened based on a 1400 price, they didn't get closed after the price crashed because all the cost was already sunk. Now we're on the other side of that, where price will grow as scarcity increases until new mines are opened (russians have plans to open one in zimbabwe sometime).

PGMs are also used in hydrogen energy.

SBSW also has displayed interest in a battery metal acquisition with downstream exposure, last month biden says US miners are a no go but internationals are good with domestic refining, I think SBSW has an acquisition in mind that will be right in line.

They're also a bit of a gold play, moderate exposure, and gold I think is more likely to go up than down. Could move a lot with the fed update."

NEWPORT BEACH, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jun. 14, 2021-- The demand for low- and negative-carbon renewable fuel has increased as more companies look for solutions to address climate change. As the leading provider of renewable natural gas (RNG) for the transportation industry, Clean Energy Fuels Corp. (NASDAQ: CLNE) is now well-positioned to turn their customers’ sustainability goals into reality.

This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210614005069/en/

(Graphic: Business Wire)

Today at its annual shareholders meeting, Clean Energy introduced a new company logo, a cornerstone of an entirely new brand identity that aligns with its growing commitment to expand its renewable fuel solution. This includes investing in the development of RNG from dairies and other agricultural facilities both independently and with partners TotalEnergies and bp.

“Clean Energy’s business has pivoted to focus on an extraordinary renewable, non-fossil fuel that can actually reduce fleets' carbon footprint by as much as 500%,” said Andrew J. Littlefair, president and CEO, Clean Energy. “The logo, color scheme, messaging, website and other brand elements that we introduced today denote a circular economy, where organic waste is turned into sustainable fuel, and embodies the role Clean Energy plays in helping our planet.”

Currently, RNG represents 70 percent of the fuel sold at Clean Energy’s nationwide network of stations, and the company is on a track to provide the fuel at all its stations by 2025, meeting one of its own sustainability goals.

As part of the new branding, Clean Energy also launched a new website with updated information about the company’s focus on being able to provide beginning-to-end solutions to meet the growing demand for RNG."

2021-06-15 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"I don't know what to do about this issue I'm having with Vanguard. It's made me lose thousands upon thousands of dollars. This keeps getting taken down in every sub I put it in. I don't know why.

EDIT: Since I'm banned from the sub but can still edit my post, I made an alt account to prove to the people commenting that they don't believe it that I actually made LOADS of accounts and hired virtual assistants to manage them. u/double5head 

&#x200B;

I  had one idea that led to another, and another, and another, etc.  After  speaking with a cpa I learned what I was doing was completely  legal and  not going  against Vanguard's TOS.

Well,    I made 600 accounts under 6 different people, all with their consent,   they are my direct family members, I would have made my own but I am a   minor.

Why 600 accounts? I will   tell you since I can't do it anymore and it will  probably be ""patched""   anyways. There are reverse splits which occur when  a company wants to   reduce the amount of shares that they have, for  whatever reason,  which  is like a regular split where the price of each  individual share  will  increase by the same ratio of the new shares  issued but in  reverse,  hence the name, reverse split.

Well    on reverse splits, if they are doing lets say a 1:10 ratio, you own 1    share, well they can't give you .1 of a stock. Sure, there is   fractional  investing that some brokerages offer, but in the real world   fractions  of shares do not exist. They will round you up, and instead   of owning .1  shares you will own 1 whole one, except it's 10 times as   valuable after  the split.

These happen on a weekly basis and are posted on the [sec.gov](https://sec.gov/)site before they do, so what I would do is I hired virtual assistants    from India to purchase 1 share of each splitting stock  to make me a    couple bucks, usually no more than $8 but some got in the $20s. I  would   make that bit of profit on each and every account, almost each  and  every  week (and sometimes multiple per week.)

Life    was great. I'm 17 and soon I'm going to be able to afford to purchase    rental properties with my vanguard money and start providing some  real   value. I kept the money in the stocks that split as I intended to  hold   them for over a year so I didn't have to pay fat stacks in  taxes, so I   never sold any of my assets. Looking back at it now I  think this was my   first big mistake, as with the knowledge I have now I  could have  easily  formed an LLC with my 22 y/o brother so I could  start leveraging  my  money with properties. Whatever, off topic.

Vanguard    closed all of my accounts without notice, and upon calling them they    said they simply did not support the activity. There is no limit to  the   amount of accounts anyone could have, but they said the method I  was   going about it was ""suspicious."" I was completely transparent with    everything. Everyone that I am working with is fully aware of what I  am   doing and trusted me enough to give me their personal information  to do   this. Vanguard told me they would call me within 2-3 business  days to   update me on their report on my account, well flash to now and  it's  been  THREE WEEKS. I can't withdraw my money or use the accounts  at all   because I can't even login to them. I called today and after an  hour of   being on hold, I was hung up on. I called again, hold for  around 30   minutes, yet again, hung up on without even being given the  CHANCE to   speak.

I think my best  option here   to at least retain the money I initially put in,  \~$3.50/account, via a   charge back through my bank. I have not allowed  these losses and  change  in structure to affect me, as I'm finding  other ways to do other  things,  but I really am concerned about the  $20/account annual fee  that each  account MIGHT be subject to next year  as well as the fact  that I have  thousands of dollars being held  hostage by a brokerage  company.

TLDR: Started making $30k/month with vanguard with reverse splits and a LOT of accounts. Vanguard closed my accounts for fun."
2021-06-15 03:14:01,wallstreetbets,Lotta doubters here but I actually used this same strategy like 15 years ago. I only had two accounts though. There was only one trade that really paid off. Made like $2k from a $20 investment. Other gains were small. But then the loophole got closed and it didn’t work any more.

2021-06-15 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"SOFI- Shorts close to folding (check out level 2 for a couple of mins as evidence)... jump in and help send them backing.. and send price immediately to $28+ ( also check L2).. tiny bit more volume. Only a small amount id added volume to crush shorts.  Some covering already started. Shorted over 20M shares the past 2 weeks (30% of volume)... and practically no short shares available now).

Total Volume today still under 2M.. so any added volume sends it over $30 today ($30 already showing up in order book- short sell offers drop off at $22.50).

If you can get a little buzz- it will be $40 by Weds. (agains look at SOFI level 2 for a couple mins for proof)"
2021-06-14 20:12:02,wallstreetbets,"Why is NOBODY on this?  They crushed their earnings AND avoided the crushing litigation RH is dealing with.  This stock is going to fly, by itself.  Nvm the SI"
2021-06-15 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Josh Enomoto Fri, June 11, 2021, 11:45 AM  

[ Source: ZikG \/ Shutterstock.com ](https://preview.redd.it/p4957h7a89571.png?width=704&format=png&auto=webp&s=b74851fa67d4bab2602160af6ea167dadf0910de)

I really wanted to talk about Clean Energy Fuels before the session of June 9, 2021 happened. Alas, the publishing schedule did not execute in my favor this time around. Nevertheless, CLNE stock remains under the $20 price target at time of writing (although that might not last too long). Therefore, I’m going to stick it in this list of cheap stocks, albeit somewhat regrettably.

As you’ve probably heard by now, CLNE became the latest target of meme stock mania. But I must say that with this idea, there’s a method to the madness. According to *CNBC*, “Newport Beach, California-based Clean Energy Fuels has a relatively small float at 66%, meaning the stock can be more easily manipulated. And about 8% of its float is sold short, according to data from FactSet.”

But do you need to hang around social media forums to justify your exposure to CLNE? As society starts to normalize substantively, Clean Energy’s business should become more relevant. Additionally, the company has a political tailwind in that it may provide a realistic, transitional source of clean energy as society progresses toward a comprehensively clean future."

2021-06-15 01:46:37,wallstreetbets,Yooo excellent DD. LFG!!
2021-06-14 21:24:41,wallstreetbets,"I read your DD and enjoyed it. The only thing that is incorrect is that Pet Co does still sell birds and lizards and shit. My girlfriend and I were at Pet Co a few days ago and saw the birds and I had to alert one of the employees that there was dead bird in the cage, very sad. Anyways, nice DD. I bought calls."

2021-06-14 21:39:17,wallstreetbets,Hoping we hit that $31 Citigroup target
2021-06-14 23:16:40,wallstreetbets,"With a ticker like WOOF and multiple usages of the word ""doggystyle"" this is destined to be a solid play. Take my money! Let's gooooooo."
2021-06-15 00:19:18,wallstreetbets,"Not convinced of the short interest being a large factor on this one. The average days in age for the short positions (according to Ortex) is 42. That means the average short position was started on May 3rd.

May 3rd closed the day at $24. 

Even after the massive $5 run up today (June 15) to $28, that only puts the short positions at a loss of $4 per share. (this is obviously a crude estimation the average short price, so take it with a grain of salt - it could be less, or it could be more)

The current estimated SI is 15.81m shares so that would be a total short loss of $63.24 million (15.81m\*$4). 

For a hedge fund with lots of assets and lots of margin, this is surely quite manageable.

Can't say anything about the rest of your DD for now until I research more."
2021-06-14 20:47:18,wallstreetbets,thanks chief

2021-06-14 20:08:36,wallstreetbets,"Guhhh, bought in at IPO and traded sideways since. Recently sold (at profit, albeit minimal) and *then, and only then*, will a DD on WSBs catch on and cause a rally I miss out on. 🤦🏻‍♀️ Third time. Granted, I do think this one is a solid value play; I just didn't personally feel like waiting around until others caught onto that too (as it was looking like it would take much longer previously)."
2021-06-14 20:38:48,wallstreetbets,"Good play eapecially when comparing chewy’s valuation. I think a 2-3x in price is achievable once they can address how to pay down their debt they barely have cash on hand and so many of their current assets are less liquid. The lower overhead of the online model is just more efficient and chewy is at like 4.5 p/s

Easily see this doubling in a year as pet purchases continue to rise"
2021-06-14 20:11:42,wallstreetbets,I bought shares a few months ago thinking about how a lot of business are gonna skyrocket now that all these depressed chicks I’m dating all have families of dogs and wanna be dog moms instead of real moms lol. Depression is at a high and everyone thinks dogs and cats are gonna fix that black hole in your heart lol. Might as well profit from it
2021-06-14 20:04:38,wallstreetbets,"Not to be a downer but, as a former petco employee of 5 years they really don't care about their groomers and force tons of unnecessary tasks/rules on them and stress them out. I was friends with the grooming dept and saw a lot of high turnover there. If you don't treat your groomers right they're going to leave. Esp because grooming is a really hard job I have seen people in the emergency room from bites and you're covered in dog shit/fur half 90 percent of the time. I hope they support their groomers more in the future."

I use a local vet, not a big box chain. Just like walmart, you get what you pay for. Only good thing about them is, they have ""supposedly"" stopped buying puppies and kittens from those disgusting over bred farms. I think this store and SeaWorld should be shorted to extinction TBH"

2021-06-15 07:43:11,wallstreetbets,Actually their leverage ratio isn't bad at all and they have adequate interest coverage ratio - debt isn't really a concern here especially after the IPO where some of the proceeds went to pay down some debt

It's hard for me to wrap my head around this, but I should show my wife because she understands this junk buying mentality like going to the dollar store to buy shit you don't need.  I get it, it makes her happy and it doesn't cost much, but ecologically it's a disaster.  I'm very much a BIFL person, I don't buy junk I don't need, and I don't enjoy going to a dollar store to look at the shit they have.  If I need something that is in the price range these places have, cost is much lower on the priority list and convenience (like 1-2 day amazon shipping) is at the top."

2021-06-15 01:40:57,wallstreetbets,"I have more in Tesla, of course not more than AMC, but this is just a Yolo account. Helps me separate my feelings when I make risky plays"
2021-06-15 16:04:58,wallstreetbets,God help you! Hope this works out! With you on this one.
2021-06-14 20:27:55,wallstreetbets,Wrong. 500k
2021-06-14 20:12:16,wallstreetbets,"Keep pumping it, it will all fall apart if you can't convince more people to buy the shares off you guys."
2021-06-15 02:48:20,wallstreetbets,Grandpa recommend it
2021-06-15 01:42:29,wallstreetbets,"I can't go negative, i've already gotten double my initial investment back. This is just house money."
2021-06-15 02:40:03,wallstreetbets,I got my initial investment x2 out at around $37. This is house money at this point
2021-06-15 01:44:47,wallstreetbets,Holy fuck they nuked you on the dislikes Haha.
2021-06-15 06:03:31,wallstreetbets,I wanna be like you some day. My yolo account has $1000 in it 😂
2021-06-15 06:23:15,wallstreetbets,All my accounts become yolo accounts… lol
2021-06-15 01:39:45,wallstreetbets,"This is the same thing that was said when it first hit $19 then dropped down to $7. Didn't sell then, not selling now"
2021-06-14 20:30:42,wallstreetbets,Wow… if that’s the case my entire portfolio was a meme.
2021-06-15 08:45:36,wallstreetbets,There are accounts that arent meme/yolo accounts?
2021-06-15 06:36:09,wallstreetbets,It's up because of wallstreet bets and nothing else I expected it stay at $7-12 up until black widow or James bond drops. Once the movies are declared back I know business will pick up but wall street bets has it so inflated that no one knows it's true value 🤦🏾‍♂️
2021-06-15 09:50:18,wallstreetbets,Y'all have accounts?
2021-06-15 11:45:24,wallstreetbets,"Yes but all the hype has increased the brand value. AMC has so many more options now and a lot of liquidity. Is the stock actually worth $50? Probably not, but I do think $50 is the floor with all things considered"
2021-06-15 10:43:10,wallstreetbets,I'm just here for the memes man
2021-06-15 05:51:43,wallstreetbets,Spastic.

2021-06-15 06:55:52,wallstreetbets,"Good one, ass wank 🥱"
2021-06-14 20:00:32,wallstreetbets,">167 MILLION IN SALES IS WORTH 30 DOLLARS A STOCK????

THE STOCK PRICE IS IRRELEVANT 

THE MARKET CAP IS ALL THAT MATTERS 

30 DOLLARS A STOCK IS LITERALLY A MEANINGLESS STATEMENT

YOU CANNOT GET ANY USEFUL INFORMATION FROM THAT"
2021-06-15 10:25:39,wallstreetbets,just threw 4500 at it lets go
2021-06-14 20:23:07,wallstreetbets,"I bought actual paper $wish shares on wish for $1, picked up 4000, will come in 6-8 weeks, get it boi!"

2021-06-14 21:32:31,wallstreetbets,"There is no shame in selling cheap shit.

Lots of people around the world are going to need their shit to get cheaper than before.

2021-06-14 21:49:13,wallstreetbets,Holding 5150 share
2021-06-14 22:01:29,wallstreetbets,I’m buying more ef jus cuz it’s wishful thinking
2021-06-14 23:45:29,wallstreetbets,Lockup period ended today. Let’s see if insiders dump after the pump. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|downvote)
2021-06-14 20:38:14,wallstreetbets,Poshmark is an awful company with trash customer service and that reputation is spreading along with piles of negative reviews and angry comments on their social media accounts by disgruntled customers. They're not going anywhere but down unless they make major corrections to their services and business model.
2021-06-14 21:03:26,wallstreetbets,"Hyping for your calls? This was 36 and took a nose dive to 7 after denying Amazon. What completely tanked it? Are they just hoping for a bigger offer? People seemed awful quick to jump ship but show other than another Amazon offer what is going to make this stock fly? 

&#x200B;

7 dollars seems awfully cheap to get in and I bet you really are bummed you bought those calls on 1/28 while you were on an adrenaline drive it's raining money bull run. Sell the rumor (already bought) the news."
2021-06-14 22:05:44,wallstreetbets,"Share price is arbitrary, market cap is what should be the focus"
2021-06-15 00:26:15,wallstreetbets,"I honestly thought this company would fizzle out inside a year. It seems like all Chinese cheaply made knockoff stuff. But clearly that doesn't matter.

I know other shops sell cheap stuff too. But this seemed even cheaper."
2021-06-14 21:09:59,wallstreetbets,do we really think this is hitting over 15 by friday
2021-06-14 22:08:16,wallstreetbets,OP is one of the really dumb apes that don’t understand that market cap is the only thing that matters
2021-06-15 06:23:30,wallstreetbets,Well that's a bad sign
2021-06-14 21:20:29,wallstreetbets,I don’t think my username would checkout if I didn’t
2021-06-15 02:10:36,wallstreetbets,All of that is more than priced in. There is plenty of cash on the balance sheet and even when you account for the gross revenue accounting on the logistics segment they still have decent revenue growth.
2021-06-14 21:57:28,wallstreetbets,🤡
2021-06-15 18:23:42,wallstreetbets,"So yes the OP did compare stock prices directly, which is silly. But they also included the market cap of all of those and when you look at it (50% market cap vs 10% of sales revenue?) doesn't it appear, still, that WISH is undervalued?"
2021-06-14 20:15:17,wallstreetbets,wish' value is measured in gigabyts
2021-06-15 18:22:25,wallstreetbets,"Okay, so, if you look at the market cap which they posted in the DD (even though, yes, they compared share prices) does that change the argument? Doesn't it still appear undervalued for how much it makes in sales vs the relative competition?"
2021-06-15 00:56:29,wallstreetbets,"I mean thats a huge portion of the GME/AMC crowd.

Gotta remember the sub gained around 8 million new members in January. Many of them may be bots, but plenty are legitimate smooth brained morons."
2021-06-14 23:37:13,wallstreetbets,Yeah it's very sus. I would rather invest in literally any of the competitors mentioned in this post considering I have actually heard of them elsewhere than wsb. I feel like this is a pump and dump/ marketing ploy.
2021-06-15 06:42:48,wallstreetbets,Hehehehr 🌮
2021-06-15 06:45:11,wallstreetbets,"In some way i think history will prove you kinda right. 

The coverup has been mindblowing, but time always untingle the lies."
2021-06-15 02:54:27,wallstreetbets,"Yes, I see the 1.9billion$ of cash that is restricted, there are no notes of what they are. I assumed they are apart of their revenue  but somehow couldn't recognized due to GAAP? (this is interim reporting, generally more loose than annual but still has rules) The litigation was specifically about the material overstatement of users and merchants increased which accounts for the largely increased in revenue in the current period. I'm not advising you to sell or buy this stock, just what is found on their financial statement."
2021-06-14 22:38:12,wallstreetbets,Looks like we got another financial illiterate victim here.
2021-06-14 21:19:45,wallstreetbets,That seems to be guaranteed at this point
2021-06-15 06:44:01,wallstreetbets,Or the ones burning up or going boom.. Did I read about a house even burning down and the owner couldent do shit bwcauae it was caused by a shitty china charger with no standards.
2021-06-15 02:57:28,wallstreetbets,"I see, thank you. 

It seems like not much dilligence was done by the underwriters of the IPO"
2021-06-14 23:01:50,wallstreetbets,"Are you the financially literate clown who is worried about sales and marketing expense of a hyper growth company. 
Also is “their website is shit” your literacy you 🤡? They operate mainly via mobile app."
2021-06-15 03:00:56,wallstreetbets,There's no need to pay attention to you. Continuing this conversation would only serve your betterment of financial maneuverings. I'll leave you behind with the free hand of the market. I'm pretty sure he will thin you out quickly and naturally.
2021-06-14 21:24:49,wallstreetbets,This sub is 100% fucked and I feel sorry for anyone who is coming here looking for easy ideas to make money. It used to at least be fun to read.

2021-06-15 09:00:23,wallstreetbets,"The reason most of you don't have money is because of the way that you view money.  You see a few million as something so far away when it's not (it's your view that makes it this way).  Enjoy you little minds and little bank accounts shitting on success.,"
2021-06-14 20:10:33,wallstreetbets,Lots of ppl spell AMC wrong around here..
2021-06-14 21:03:08,wallstreetbets,"I just remembered- You owe me $10. 

Congrats and fuck off. U lucky ducky. And ignore the haters on here."
2021-06-14 21:15:55,wallstreetbets,"Crsr has been on my WL since IPO. I've always thought it to be severely undervalued, but it has been in a long decay with no sign of the rest of the market realizing it's potential. Loaded up on the dips around noon and a few more into close. Mostly stocks, but a few weekly yolos. Here's to hoping the momentum continues"
2021-06-14 21:29:06,wallstreetbets,Sweet bro

2021-06-14 22:47:08,wallstreetbets,kind of not interested in the yolos from people already millionaires.
2021-06-14 20:01:19,wallstreetbets,"only believable if he said ""I lost $1 Million on CRSR this morning"""

2021-06-14 21:09:52,wallstreetbets,You can edit the page to display anything you want in developer tools. Screenshot doesn’t prove anything. Video clicking a URL to the page and having it display that way would be better proof.
2021-06-14 21:21:05,wallstreetbets,That doesn’t really prove anything. You can just open the dev tools and edit the HTML to make the page display anything you want. It’s really simple to right click on the part you want to change and make it say whatever you want. That’s how people make fake screenshots of tweets.

2021-06-15 09:27:52,wallstreetbets,Yessir! 🚀🚀🚀
2021-06-15 09:18:36,wallstreetbets,"I actually think WSB is going to help make a lot of people financially successful because they are exposed to people here that have made a lot of money. It normalizes it a little more which can lead to a paradigm shift of, “Hey, that guy made money - so can I”. Financial success is predicated on mindset (and hard work). Making a lot of money can take time (it did for me) but that’s okay. But I agree with you in that having a mind set that people with money are just lucky and didn’t work for it will prevent one from having it themselves. A mindset of resenting  wealthy people will make it really hard to become wealthy yourself."
2021-06-14 22:05:05,wallstreetbets,"""aged poorly"" Guy says after one day of trading which is still up 11%. Lmao"
2021-06-14 21:58:33,wallstreetbets,Thank you! Message me your venmo and the $10 is yours. Seriously.

2021-06-15 09:27:09,wallstreetbets,Thank you sir. It’s been a long while since I’ve got a compliment on my dong. Just what I needed to have the confidence to kick some ass today!
2021-06-15 09:27:32,wallstreetbets,It’s coming back my friend.
2021-06-14 21:03:06,wallstreetbets,CRSR is already pumped because of its massive 2020/21 sales from corona / covid. That isn’t going to be maintained in 2022+.
2021-06-14 22:20:58,wallstreetbets,Not really. There are a dozen or so trending pretty strong.
2021-06-14 21:02:44,wallstreetbets,"Whatever pays the bills for you buddy. Seriously, I’m interested in your investment strategy. Do tell."
2021-06-14 22:28:11,wallstreetbets,I was up 3% right after initiating the trade when I posted. This isn’t a gain post. So every trade you make is deep in the money day one?
2021-06-14 21:53:18,wallstreetbets,It closed below his cost basis lol
2021-06-14 20:45:12,wallstreetbets,I didn’t make $36k. I was just up $36k within a few minutes of initiating my position. I haven’t sold. This wasn’t a GAIN post. Just a YOLO post.
2021-06-14 23:13:49,wallstreetbets,Gotcha. I’m sure you will be kind enough to discontinue your participation in WSB once your OTM calls on AMC and GME print. Your yolos after that just won’t be interesting to anyone here anymore.
2021-06-14 20:53:28,wallstreetbets,"Nah, I still would have been accused of having a fake account!"
2021-06-14 20:55:27,wallstreetbets,Good to know. Damn you are funny.

2021-06-15 18:01:11,wallstreetbets,Grad school tuition at USC was $70k. We lived in a shitty ass apartment and my wife worked her ass off to keep us from digging any deeper while I was in school. We just lived cheap  plowed money toward paying down the loan until it was gone. I’m 41 btw.
2021-06-15 14:28:31,wallstreetbets,"Fair question. First of all, most seasoned real estate guys that I know don’t do a lot of hands on investing in the stock market. I’m different in that way. 

I still do a lot of real estate investing (mostly multifamily) and much of my net worth is in real estate. That will always be my main source of income and investment focus. But prices have run up so long and fast, especially in the last 18 months that good opportunities are actually scarce - unless I want to buy into the frenzy, which I don’t. 

When the pandemic hit, no one, including me, saw the insane housing appreciation that would ensue. Hell, it was already frothy in multifamily before the pandemic hit. When I saw that the pandemic would likely result in a market crash I realized there would be tremendous opportunity in the rebound - an opportunity that would result in a risk vs return much better than real estate, which was really frothy, even then. Even with interest rates as low as they are yield in cash flowing real estate at current values is extremely low. 

So in March of last year I went all in and margined up on value stocks and held through a ton of volatility but killed it on the recovery play. This is how I typically invest in the stock market (value plays, buy dips, hold). Recently, all of those value stocks are in my mind overvalued. That brings me to where I am now. 

I seek out opportunity. I am also an adrenaline junkie. And probably going through a midlife crisis. Haha! As an opportunist and a risk taker, I fairly recently decided to see if I could exploit the crazy volatility and “pumps” in the WSB speculative fervor. I don’t really do options, mostly just shares - which is obviously much less risky, even in large amounts. This isn’t a long term strategy for me and I don’t think it will be a viable one for many people once things get back to “normal”. 

I am literally quitting my day job in about 2 months, never to return to corporate life. How much I make or lose during this meme stock stint will have no bearing on my ability to continue to live comfortably and be financially secure going forward. It’s not that I have millions upon millions. It’s just that I have a sustainable skill set and confidence that I’ll always be able to make good money at this stage in my life.

All that said, I’m much more diligent with my money than I think my posts suggest. But diligent doesn’t mean conservative. I’m a risk taker but confident that my decisions in the aggregate will continue to grow my wealth."
2021-06-14 21:16:55,wallstreetbets,"Do people not use ""Acct""?"
2021-06-15 00:06:37,wallstreetbets,"Son, I will give you your start up money. But only if your business plan is to photoshop big yolo bets (make sure to leave out the “T” in “account”) and post them on WSB. Pump the stock after everyone jumps in after your yolo. Then don’t be a retard and miss selling at the top like your daddy always does. Fuck this diamond hands shit. We split the money 90/10. I get the 90. You good with that?"

But then I was watching some Milton Freidman propaganda film and he went to some shithole country where people were slaving away for 16 hours a day in a factory for pennies, and he's grinning and beaming and saying how their kids would be slightly better off. 

Just admitting that they themselves were going to be dirt poor slaves for life no matter how hard they worked. 

The guys pitching all that ""hard work makes you rich"" bullshit know exactly what the reality is. It's just a story to trick the gullible into grinding themselves into dirt serving capital in exchange for nothing."

Their mice are good, for example. Love my m65.

Their case fans are good, but overpriced.

Their cases are *okay.*

Their keyboards are fucking trash. Overpriced mechanicals with non-standard layouts and shitty caps with ""gamer"" font. Hands down the worst mainstream keyboards on the market.

Their AOIs are also fucking trash.

Their coolers: some are okay, some are trash. 

Very hit or miss. Corsair is one of those companies where you have to read reviews for individual products, because you can't trust that a product with a corsair logo is good, based on name alone.

They are very good at marketing, though, and somehow convince a lot of people to pay $80 for their shitty keyboards (which is amazing, honestly)."

When they issue a stock they 9-10 xs pump it for as much as a yr it just hangs and is in a trading range then it will go back down mathematically depending on each chart it’s different then advance. Growth stock really only make money 1-2-3 months a yr the rest they are range bound. That is why you need to learn how to read a chart.

Bruh, I was literally responding to someone who said all their stuff was good with a counter-opinion. Why didn't you call that person an asshole for being ""assertive?"" Oh right, because you agree with him and not me. Pretty lame to accuse me of being an asshole just due to that.

>These things are literally all subjective

Literally not, though. I mean, you're allowed to like whatever you want, but the quality of components (and the pricing of keyboards given the components) is very literally objective. Things like keyboard switches and keycaps are standardized products, so they can be directly compared. Corsair just uses cherry switches and ABS keycaps and charges 3x as much as anyone else for them. And because they use a weird corsair-specific layout, you can't use aftermarket keycaps on them."

Indeed a very good point and omg revenues increase of 72% yoy is a quite substantial argument to buy in (in my sole opinion). I am very impressed by the financial health of the company/ growth target, and honestly I didn’t know Corsair before.

Their mandate is to invest for 2-5 years. This IPO was their exit strategy. Their shares were locked until March, they did a second offering At $35 extending the lockup to April. Then the market crashed and they didn’t unwind. June 3rd they sold 5 million shares for $31.87.

It is silly to think they won’t sell at $35’s, $40’s etc. Frankly, this entire runup could have been orchestrated by them or a firm they hired. I’ve been a Corsair bull for a long time, since IPO. I’ve done multiple DD’s, many which were removed. The interest in Corsair felt very artificial. But I’m not complaining, I made $18,000 in gains yesterday and sold a bunch of covered calls when it was above $40."

One interesting thing that I've noticed with Corsair as a customer of theirs for 15 years is how much they have grown and diversified.

15 years ago they were THE computer memory manufacturer to buy. They had the best chips, the best quality, the best warrenty, etc. They largely grew out of that as others moved into that space. 10 years ago they were the computer power supply manufacture to buy. Then the computer case manufacture to buy. Then moved in to mice and keyboards with decent success. I think there's better options for each piece of computer hardware in each category they are in these days, but what excites me is where they are going compared to other similar companies."

2021-06-14 21:01:43,wallstreetbets,"I suppose the interesting perspective would be to look at it from the /r/pcmasterrace crowd.

Their hardware is competent but usually not absolute best and sells at a premium price.  Every niche they compete in, other individual firms do as well or better.  Crucial/Micron memory is less prone to surprise spec changes, Seasonic has a better rep for PSUs, Arctic Cooling sells five quality non-LED fans for the price of one Corsair ARGB fan, and their keyboards are undercut by a thousand other brands on the low end, and outclassed by boutique products on the high end.

What they can promise is an ecosystem.  Buy all Corsair kit and it can all be centrally controlled to light up like Pride exploded all over your desk, and you don't need 12 janky vendor-supplied packages to do it, just one.

But what happens if OpenRGB becomes a defacto standard?  You can buy whichever parts are most compelling on their own.  Corsair would lose mindshare and pricing power."
2021-06-14 21:08:27,wallstreetbets,"Bought 100 shares at 14.55 when they went public cuz I like their products. Would have bought more but the lack of founder led ownership made me only dip my toe in.

2021-06-15 03:56:05,wallstreetbets,"Corsair is competing with the likes of Logitech, HyperX, Razer, and SteelSeries, all of whom have a pretty solid track record and following within gaming. Logitech makes quality products and I know Razer is the quintessential brand. My personal favorite is hyperX because the quality is great and they’re up and coming. I’ve had steelseries products before but I don’t think they’re as popular as the others, same with Corsair. So for anyone reading this, they definitely have tough competition in that market."
2021-06-15 04:37:05,wallstreetbets,"Man I'm dumb. I wanted to grab corsair completely unrelated to the recent hype. Jumped on my broker to buy as it opens cos in Australia, NYC open is 11:30pm here so I just buy at open for long term. It's down 14% cos I didnt know about the pre-market shit."

Impossible to know if they sold any today based on the absolutely outrageous volume (no other day has even been close.)

Their holdings are part of the shares outstanding. They have sold on 3 previous occasions between 1M and 10M shares at much lower prices. Easiest way to monitor their holdings through SEC filings. Their cost basis is between $6-$7 per CRSR's S-1.

What bothers me is not the 5M shs sale but the 56.9M shs they still have. No doubt they want to lower their holdings and have a lot of selling to do. It was mentioned they sell twice a year but I would imagine they're not restricted from selling whenever they want... which would be whenever they want.

Yeah, AMC went up even after the company sold shares but it wasn't close to 60% of the company. You can't count on the whims of apes to hold things up. This is a huge chunk of the company."

The problem relying on future manufacturing to save you is eventually you hit a wall or things don't work out, and Intel's Soviet model of fab replication suddenly worked against it, holding it back from modern nodes. Their ""failed"" products were the ones that were cynically released with 1-2% better performance to try and win back the mindshare while pricing them double and triple what non-fanatic customers people would pay. 

I think we're going to see the same kind of negativity apply to Nvidia soon enough, with their cynical 3070ti and 3080ti in a market where you can't even buy the base card due to lack of inventory.

Corsair have been a market for 20 years and they still are a market leader. The quality of corsair memory modules and power supplies is on par with the best-in-class. 

Pretty sure if you did more than browse PCMR for the best looking led lights on dimms you would find they've consistently had the best class power supply and memory modules for as long as enthusiast PC gaming has been around and they still have a **significant market share due to perceived quality of their products**. IE, refuting your first post about them being outclassed generally, and your second more slothful somehow comparing them to Motorola.

EDIT** Lets try a random Google search: ""Best Power Supply 2021""

- Best budget Power Supply: Corsair Product

> Games are fun when played, and generally boring to watch.

Because of the amount of time and effort needed to keep up with gaming, I grew out of the gamer side and got much more cozy with watching streams. I think as those of us who used to game age out of the scene, we will migrate towards watching others play in our place. Or maybe I'm just old and enjoy the sentiment.

> [...] keyboard with pretty LED's is better than a $10 Walmart one

Just look at some [PC] Gaming subreddits and you'll see that, yes, a pretty LED lightshow seems to be a staple of gaming and enthusiast hardware. Even old game consoles get the LED accessory treatment.

2021-06-15 07:18:21,wallstreetbets,But this is my I invested in WOOF
2021-06-15 13:23:29,wallstreetbets,"I was in high tech journalism back then and I remember thinking that it could not last. I was one of the last people I knew back then to get paid in full. 

There's a difference between the rank and file and the Masters of the Universe. Maybe I needed a /s tag?"
2021-06-15 01:29:12,wallstreetbets,"Dude you suck at math.  Unprofitable companies have negative P/E, and negative numbers are super low, even lower than 0.  That's why they are the best investments; they have the lowest P/Es."
2021-06-15 00:02:26,wallstreetbets,Of course we're in a bubble. Trillions of dollars have been printed
2021-06-14 21:16:22,wallstreetbets,"That's not really how it works nor how it has worked historically.

Yes we *should* still be experiencing the recession from 2020 by all metrics, more accurately we should just have begun seeing the recovery since then around now. However we're not anymore and markets and the economy remained irrational long enough for GDP growth to catch up, so arguing that we should still be in a poor economy because of covid is now not really true since our economy is now *better* off by a large margin than it was pre covid.

As for a short term shit storm you would have been right if GDP growth was lacklust this year but it wasn't. Estimated GDP is set to **grow** by 7% this year, literally the highest it's ever surged since the '50s.

Expecting a bear market in the short term is just not going to happen and is literally just like the predictions that a 'crash was coming!!!!11' in 2010 when the GDP growth was 5%.

Moreover, historically speaking we tend to see economic **booms** after crises not pullbacks. We will see a pullback for sure maybe within this decade or at the beginning of next decade but first we're more likely to boom. 

Expect spending to rise as things re open not fall."

2021-06-14 23:00:14,wallstreetbets,Yeah I noticed that too. A lot of accounts made around January. Hmmm what else happened around January? Lol
2021-06-14 20:10:47,wallstreetbets,"I'm with you on this one. Long shares (won't sell those for a long time) and long Aug. calls and Dec. calls as well. Let's see what happens. Although the short interest isn't high, we've seen stocks without high short interest explode too. There aren't a whole lot of shares floating, which matters even more in my opinion. With the Russell Indices including UWMC, as well as the company's share buyback program, it could spark a run higher.  


We'll just have to wait and see what's up though. Pretty much just love the CEO and the share structure."

Interviewed for a job using his fake internet name instead of his real name. 

6 figure position in an EV SPAC (GOEV, the good one)

Mod of r/canoo

Worked at big time investment banks ( you know which ones) so he has the latest insider information.

**CallsOnAutism** can balance trade talk and shitposting. Most of us suck at both, rarity to be good at both.

**SpaceWasteCadet** does great DD, rare earth metals a few months back was fantastic and also used to write the diary posts for early unpinned days.

2021-06-14 23:49:19,wallstreetbets,You either live long enough to get the lambo or die starving on the street

2021-06-15 00:26:33,wallstreetbets,Thank you! May God bless you for good intensions!
2021-06-14 20:26:47,wallstreetbets,Are we talking about options where you can make up to 3 trades per day? If not aren’t you considered a day trader and thus must meet the broker criteria? Sorry I’m still so new to all of this. I too have a saving of 3k but so far I’m only investing a few hundred here and there netting to about $50 profit lol
2021-06-14 22:02:24,wallstreetbets,"No, not options, just stocks. I dont think there's a limit to how many trades you can make in a day but I'm also talking about more or less trading daily and selling high and buying low during the day and during open/close. Mainly if you're trying to make money fast fins high float stocks and watch them like a hawk so you don't lose your money."
2021-06-15 10:17:48,wallstreetbets,You missed 'Flip Over Rewind Daily'.

2021-06-15 00:53:20,wallstreetbets,People are dumb and jealous if it wasnt their idea.
2021-06-15 01:08:25,wallstreetbets,I just started in this investment “thing” but I hope I one day gain half the knowledge and confidence you have!

2021-06-15 16:53:52,wallstreetbets,"What, you got a problem with being held?"
2021-06-15 01:17:51,wallstreetbets,Probably a stupid question but what's gain porn?
2021-06-15 17:00:49,wallstreetbets,"OTM bruh... we're autists, not Investors.

Oh sure we might be ITM for a minute, but like a marriage... it won't last."
2021-06-14 23:17:02,wallstreetbets,"It works better for me, seems to last longer, too.  Regular Omeprazole doesn't seem to sh* 🤣"
2021-06-15 13:31:03,wallstreetbets,"LOL, probably. 

Either that or I play video games."

2021-06-15 17:05:50,wallstreetbets,That's what I meant but lasting 1 minute is generous
2021-06-15 13:27:08,wallstreetbets,"I have absolutely no idea.

The beard is the last to know."
2021-06-14 23:19:27,wallstreetbets,"I was having stomach issues for a long time and didn’t even know these things existed, so I took omeprazole every day for three weeks and it went away. It only pops up when I drink champagne usually, so I’ll pop an Omeprazole with a Pepcid AC simultaneously. That usually does the trick.

I’ll check out your recommendation though."

2021-06-15 08:56:20,wallstreetbets,"It may be silly, but in the words of the dude: that is just like your opinion man. There aren't any moral brokers, they are all corporate wasps that achieve maximum benefit upon inflicting maximum pain. I appreciate your concern for fellow trader's well being."
2021-06-14 22:21:52,wallstreetbets,"Never heard of thinkorswim. In your opinion, how does fidelity compare to RH with regards to ease of use? I want to leave RH but I’m not interested in a complicated UI."
2021-06-14 21:51:32,wallstreetbets,Buy calls on yum? 🤔
2021-06-14 23:49:26,wallstreetbets,I don't think I have high enough level to trade margin on TDA rn but I'm buying calls
2021-06-14 22:28:56,wallstreetbets,"For ease of use, RH is king. The tradeoff is that it sucks. Bad fills, super limited options, no futures or overseas equities, etc.

I think you'd like ThinkorSwim. Their mobile app and web UI rival RH's ease of use IMO. Just with all the power of TDA behind it. And if you already have a TDA account, you're good to go."

2021-06-14 20:35:43,wallstreetbets,"After seeing what $GME did and still doing nothing is impossible anymore. Social media platforms have brought a whole new game to the stock markets. I find it funny when they say the SEC is watching the media networks to see if they are breaking the law. Really??? Shorting stocks if that is legal then openly talking about stocks is legal too. If I say ""hey I like this stock"" you should buy. It's no different in my opinion than a guy telling his friend or girl telling her friend girl that they should short a stock. I am not a financial advisor. I mainly just sit on the sidelines and want to ask them ""you mad bro?"" 😂"
2021-06-14 20:12:49,wallstreetbets,"I’ve just about got the concept (budging in here). Based on your math and the “breakeven price” on RH, can one assume that that price indicates what price the stock has to be at to breakeven? So it’d have to be higher than $50 to breakeven?"

2021-06-14 20:10:26,wallstreetbets,Iv been watching and reading for weeks. But I'm about there to where I'm about to place some contracts. Research research research. If you have TD Ameritrade you can use think or swim and do paper trades and practice practice. I'm sure there are other ways to do paper trades with other programs. That's what I've been doing.
2021-06-14 20:20:15,wallstreetbets,"Correct. A call option is a bet that the price will go up. If you think the stock I own will go up, I let you pay me a premium for the right to buy my stock at a specific price. Say the stock price is $10, you think it’s going to $20 so you pay me $5 for the right to buy one share from me at $14 by this Friday. If the stock stays below $14, I keep your $5. If the stock goes to $19 you break even. If it goes to $20, you make a $1. Most option contracts are for 100 shares, if that was the case in this example, the contract could be exercised to make $100 if the price jumped to $20."
2021-06-14 20:06:34,wallstreetbets,Now this is truth. Everyday you can watch the stock go up right before the Bell. I guess it's like pressure form after hours trading. I used to get manipulated into buying before the Bell during the pre-market. Learned my lesson. Now I wait about 20-30 min let the cash burn off. Then decide. Today was a good day. My stock of $spce is putting the pressure on the shorts and finally is getting up there. Me and my 100 shares about to take flight ✈️

2021-06-14 20:07:43,wallstreetbets,"I don’t mean to be argumentative, but wouldn’t you, as the investor theoretically sitting on at least a respectable amount of liquid assets, benefit more from going very heavily into debt while interest rates are at rock bottom and trying to roll up as much of this free flowing money as possible before the actual crash - at which point your debt should consume far less relative buying power and be easier to pay off?"
2021-06-15 00:19:43,wallstreetbets,I’m always holding SPY puts to be ready for the next crash… when one die I just reload and take the loss then one day I wake up to 500% gain like March 2020…. Pay biggly moar than the cost
2021-06-14 20:13:10,wallstreetbets,"You good no worries. I look at debt as something that makes me a slave to someone or something else. You are correct in your understanding of dollar value during inflation and the possibility of “having more and paying with less valued dollars.” However if you were to lose your job, or have something bad happen and not be able to pay that debt then you and your loved ones are on the hook. If you were out of debt (especially from a large amount of asset gain) you could purchase things that would still hold value through devaluation of a dollar without being in debt. And if you lost your job or income you would still own your house, car, etc…which gives you a better opportunity to survive that kind of craziness. Again this is just my advice and perspective. Many other apes disagree and think I’m a retarded boomer…I’m ok with that."

I know Rolex’s are great investments. I’ve had 3 but just as watches to own, not sell. Rocking a gold/stainless submariner with blue face now. Like the rose gold date just with MOP dial. If I could get a good deal on a new platinum I might replace the sub but I’m
Hard on watches."
2021-06-14 21:14:55,wallstreetbets,"Passive income from those no. Passive income from farm land crop rental, commercial property rent. Hunting club leases on farm land. Dividends on stocks. You don’t have to make passive income on everything. You can buy, hold, let things appreciate and sell. Cash is king: cars, cattle, art is and can be cash. Wine profits are tax free. Buy. Let things appreciate: keep a portion of the profits and reinvest the proceeds. 10-31 land exchanges can help with taxes on land purchases"
2021-06-14 22:39:15,wallstreetbets,"I guess the safest way is either to buy from reputable re-sellers which there are a ton online or if you buy enough from Rolex, they'll let you buy the most ""popular watches"" 😂 And then you can quickly flip it for 50-100% profit right after lol or hold.

I heard eBay has a authenticator system now so every watch is going to be authenticated by them. If you purchase from someone, they must send the watch to eBay where they will help you authenticate if the watch is over $2000 and then send it to know. I know they are doing this with sneakers right now."
2021-06-14 21:21:32,wallstreetbets,"I get that, I was pointing out that your statement is incorrect. There is a difference between an asset that earns passive income and one that appreciates to create profit through capital gain. Passive income means you own something that is in demand so people pay you to use. Capital gains rely on the assumption that there will be higher demand in some future state and someone will buy it from you."
2021-06-14 22:07:13,wallstreetbets,"Farms, commercial real estate, land, all make passive income."
2021-06-14 22:38:25,wallstreetbets,"I know, but wine and old cars don’t. You stated they did when you included them in your statement about assets that make passive income. Your statement is incorrect."

2021-06-15 01:50:32,wallstreetbets,"After the pandemic bazooka was unleashed, pretty much every Fed conference was bid up early intraday with some unwinding at some point during the speech (Wednesday). 

But recently, market volatility has been relatively narrow compared to then, so that could limit the play. There’s an established range and the highs are getting slower to break. The only thing that markets aren’t really expecting is the Fed saying the labor market is tighter than the jobs numbers currently show because of boomers retiring early or pre-pandemic workers leaving the labor force—whatever reason. If that *doesn’t happen* I’d exit immediately, especially if the puts have a short expiry.

Even if the Fed just announces a cutting back of QE, that could be seen as bullish confidence in the economy, and most of that Fed money is currently being returned anyways. Honestly, if the latter happens and not the former I’d say we break up rather than down."

2021-06-14 22:22:11,wallstreetbets,This aged quite well despite the downvotes
2021-06-15 12:33:50,wallstreetbets,It popped off this morning. Just stopping for a refuel now!  🚀
2021-06-15 12:22:17,wallstreetbets,"They wouldn't do that to OP, he seems like a nice guy...

Just noticed op hasn't posted in the past couple days. This didn't turn out the way he'd expected I'm guessing, based on the average buy prices. Either he's smart and set S/L's or he's underwater by like $10K rn."
2021-06-14 23:31:11,wallstreetbets,Wait - is that before steel price went 3x. . . .
2021-06-14 23:25:39,wallstreetbets,Wait - we’re about to enter a steel super cycle. . . .   So we are going to meet you there at $94. . .
2021-06-14 22:04:08,wallstreetbets,"I wish I knew this before buying TSMC at their last high. I'm waiting to break even still, so I can re-allocate those funds."
2021-06-15 13:06:59,wallstreetbets,how much are you down now? Must be hard to look at :/
2021-06-15 13:27:00,wallstreetbets,Down a lot. I sold 100 of the 140 around $20 each this AM. I've put in a buy order to buy 160 of those contracts at $10 if the IV and time/price bring the value down that low. It's just a number. I've been broke for so long and the numbers I've seen over the last 6 months have completely ruined my concept of what 'a lot' is. IE my Schwab account is literally down $185K just today. Just chillin. I'm posting more updates on r/TheRaceTo10Million since I don't want to / can't spam WSB with marginal updates.
2021-06-15 15:16:51,wallstreetbets,"Good luck to you, don't fall into the house money effect"
2021-06-15 17:06:33,wallstreetbets,I've fallen and I can't get up.
2021-06-14 23:04:24,wallstreetbets,You must have had a good day today?
2021-06-15 07:40:55,wallstreetbets,"We're at the AMC (what?)
We're at the GME (what?)
We're at the Combination
AMC and GME!"
2021-06-15 02:32:39,wallstreetbets,Down voting you
2021-06-14 20:04:14,wallstreetbets,"You can't diamond hand calls, retard."
2021-06-15 00:27:52,wallstreetbets,😂😂
2021-06-15 00:34:51,wallstreetbets,How do you buy warrants? (Excuse my ignorance)
2021-06-15 00:36:17,wallstreetbets,"You search for the ticker “GOEVW” and you can buy it just like any other stock. You can’t buy warrants with Robinhood or WeBull, but you can with other brokers like Fidelity, ToS and etc."
2021-06-15 07:00:17,wallstreetbets,"Ah ok, I use RB that’s why I didn’t see it."
2021-06-15 07:00:41,wallstreetbets,So they’re like options but longer?
2021-06-15 18:29:47,wallstreetbets,Been loading up since the high 30s. Currently sitting on 2100 shares and 70 $50 leaps.
2021-06-15 19:14:55,wallstreetbets,What would you say are the Best call options to buy
2021-06-15 14:03:32,wallstreetbets,Bro please tell me you held still
2021-06-15 17:44:35,wallstreetbets,I sold - it would have been another 15k gain today
2021-06-15 17:45:02,wallstreetbets,"I sold above 20 on the 600s, and at 19 on the 650s"
2021-06-15 19:14:23,wallstreetbets,Sheeeeeesh. Good fuckn shit brotha
2021-06-15 11:40:53,wallstreetbets,Where's my love at?  I'm up 5% since this post and I believe we are about to see a huge dip this week... You have massive hedge fund investments that have to draw down before end of the quarter their positions.  This stock is going to get nailed.
2021-06-15 13:06:57,wallstreetbets,"I like horses. I like apes. I like to work. Therefore - I like to work with Apes and horses. Because horses are more common for interacting with humans - If I had a company, I would call it workhorse. From a ticker perspective, and if I was to IPO, I would select WKHS, as this ticker would allow me to closely mirror the name of said company.  Hypothetically speaking of course."
2021-06-15 06:44:22,wallstreetbets,Now you can look back and see it was fake news lol
2021-06-15 07:51:06,wallstreetbets,"Dude, the insiders are probably waiting for the cash open to sell like everyone else. You're pushing this weirdly hard. I think the $7 something the stock was trading for last week is fairer value, and I see no reason beyond a pump as to why WISH got higher. I'll wait."
2021-06-15 10:09:00,wallstreetbets,simply trying to call out the truth so people do their own research.  I think wish is a good bet.. much better than the others pushed on here and just want to help point people in the right direction to do research.
2021-06-14 21:26:13,wallstreetbets,Peak Boiz lol we gonna take you up higher tomorrow don’t worry bro
