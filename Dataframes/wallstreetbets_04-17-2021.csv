2021-04-17 19:20:39,wallstreetbets,"I've read the other posts and the comments in the other posts but I still think I'm a bit confused, hopefully you can help me understand.

So, first, I think I understand that as the market goes up, your leverage decreases and so you then use that leverage to buy more, that's the compounding part, right? But if it goes down, and you need to sell to maintain your leverage ratio, I guess it may not necessarily be at a loss due to overall cost basis, but it certainly could be, no? And if you're buying more on the way up, that just turns it into a wash sale, unless you wait 90 days which seems like way too long to rebalance. But you're not selling on the way up, so where are the profits coming from? Solely unrealized gains? So what am I missing/not understanding here?

Also you've mentioned this *could* be done with a smaller portfolio, but afaik, portfolio margin needs 100k minimum. I read in another comment you mentioned selling puts when the account was closer to 50k, but that doesn't generate buying power like selling a box spread with PM does, so I'm confused here as well, and almost all of those tickers have very very poor option chains with no liquidity to sell puts on anyway."

You'll have to think about it a bit to convince yourself but it's mathematically true. If you need to buy again and only recently sold, just buy a similar-enough ETF to avoid the wash sale. Or buy more of the other ETFs already in your portfolio that you haven't sold recently. It is more important to get the leverage-stock ratio right, than the specific ETF ratios.  
Profits come purely from unrealized gains and a little bit of dividends. This is very tax-efficient. You can see my unrealized gains thus far.  


PM is ideal because you can sell SPX for cheap financing. Otherwise, just use regular margin with a smaller account. I'm surprised I recommended selling puts, but I take it back if I did. That's very tax inefficient and would have to be on the S&P 500 only (low diversification). Better to just leverage on margin and upgrade to PM and SPX boxes once you hit $100K."

2021-04-17 19:10:47,wallstreetbets,There is some amount of leverage that leads to max compound returns given stock risk/volatility/Bear markets. That‚Äôs about 2:1 for the past 220 years and is called the Kelly Criterion. More leverage might look better during Bull markets but end up making less long term once you actually have bad times.

2021-04-17 19:40:26,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the explanation, a couple more questions if you don't mind!

> If you sell to control leverage, then by definition, there will be positions that have unrealized losses that you can sell. You'll have to think about it a bit to convince yourself but it's mathematically true.

Right, that makes sense.

Yeah you said you had sold puts when you were on another broker (https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mk71rt/wsb_leveraged_smartbeta_still_going_bonkers_up/gtga3i8/)

So you're just saying buy the stock using regular margin (so for an easy example if the broker initially gave you 2:1 leverage for most stocks, with $10k you could buy 200 shares of a stock at a price of $100), keep some cash in reserve so that you don't get margin called immediately if it drops, and just accumulate as the market goes in your favor, and sell if not?

So at the end of the year are you always sitting on realized losses that you can use as tax write-offs and then when you're finally happy with whatever number your account is showing that's when you realize the gains?"
2021-04-17 18:48:15,wallstreetbets,Can you explain how you use them?
2021-04-17 18:54:01,wallstreetbets,"Are you stupid? Stocks go up, stocks go down, and in options the price of it could go down while the stock goes up. Sunk cost fallacy is for day trading and not for investors with a set plan. You‚Äôre probably the type of person to laugh at people for buying GME at $45 only to say you thought $45 was a good buy point. Stocks go up, stocks go down and sometimes they just go sideways. Expecting to time volatility perfectly is like throwing darts while blind. Eventually you will be right, but you will have a tendency of being wrong."
2021-04-17 19:15:10,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-04-17 19:48:25,wallstreetbets,"I sold puts personally before, yes. But it's not what I recommend at all, it's just nowhere near as good.
Yes, buy 2:1 with margin. So with 10K cash, you'd end up with an account with 20K in stocks and a cash balance of -10K. THere's no need to keep cash, the account will have negative cash (that's what a margin loan is). You shouldn't get an actual margin call, you should sell positions if your leverage starts to rise, well before you ever reach actualy liquidation levels (leverage of 4:1). Accumulate as your account grows in value, yes.

And yeah, it's super tax efficient. I have losses realized for years from March that I will use to decrease my income tax, yet I'm sitting on a ton of gains. Some day, I guess I will retire and might actually start selling even if leverage is below 2.2. In other words, I'll sell and realize gains. But until then, this compounds nearly tax-free."
2021-04-17 18:49:02,wallstreetbets,"Here's a good thread on exactly that:

2021-04-17 17:25:36,wallstreetbets,I think the question is: how much is leftover after you take out insiders and long hold institutions like vanguard. Seems like insiders + institutions = 90 million shares ish. So that‚Äôs 50 million share float left over and 35-40 million shares of that is shorted. Can‚Äôt wait to see the updated short statistics
2021-04-17 17:50:46,wallstreetbets,"Reasonable reading of a very confusing filing. However, even if true, this still has a very good chance of squeezing next week due to the massive gamma ramp established in the options chain. GME/AMC squeezed a 2nd time with less on-paper short interest. Anything over 20% is high and worthy of short squeeze consideration but what gets picked is based on simple market psychology and short term belief in a ""story"". So, i wouldn't bet against clov but i don't think it will reach gme heights either."

&#x200B;

All you need to know about this company is this:

&#x200B;

* It's one of Chamath's many, many scammer endeavors
* There is a significant amount of short interest, which makes it a very volatile stock
* Volatile stocks based on this thesis are great for intraday scalps but are not investible.  Like, really great.  However, you will never see a significant gamma squeeze like you saw with Gamestop in early January, as most of the shorts are sitting in the $8-$9 range already, and thus aren't feeling any squeeze pressure.  This, for the record, is why the modern day Gamestop squeeze theory is complete garbage and fatally flawed.  Those shorts are all comfortably sitting at $350-400.  Not $3 like they were at the turn of the year.
* You should never hold this stock.  Ever.  If you want to trade it, put it on a watch list and if you see it starting to go parabolic, scale in for the ride up, and either use your ""Travelcenters of America"" (using that from now on cause the automod bans me when I use the acronym for technical analysis for quoting a sub billion company) skills to identify where the peak is (it's usually somewhere between 9 and 11 dollars) or else guess and hope for the best, then sell your calls right as the volume starts to dry up a little bit.  The trade should take no more than half an hour.
* Immediately go short and let it retrace at least 50% of the way back down.  If you're good with Travelcenters of America, you can probably let it retrace 80%.  If you were shadowing me yesterday, you saw me call a top at $10.02 (I was 1 cent off, sue me), told everybody to go into 5/21 9p's, and had them hold to $8.32 (so I was 4 cents off on the downside, double sue me).  Which means if you played my shadow right, you were in that trade for 2 hours, entered in your put at $1.30 and you exited at 1.70.  Intraday like that is the only worthwhile way to play this ""company"".
* If you ""just like the stock"", you might be the bad kind of retarded.

&#x200B;

Just my humble opinion.  I could be wrong....but it's really unlikely.

&#x200B;

All my love

2021-04-17 17:44:45,wallstreetbets,Um I don‚Äôt think CLOV squeeze is the play but holy shit Citadel doesn‚Äôt own S3. Where‚Äôs the tinfoil hat emoji?
2021-04-17 18:29:38,wallstreetbets,"You could just look at OPs post history to see its not it.

But sure, peddle your conspiracy theories.

And citadel owns s3? Lmfao. 2 month old account trying to spread conspiracy Bullshit over here."
2021-04-17 17:03:08,wallstreetbets,OP doesn‚Äôt care. Delusional
2021-04-17 17:39:05,wallstreetbets,They own less than half a percent
2021-04-17 17:06:16,wallstreetbets,Lol you must be losing money on GME.
2021-04-17 17:13:30,wallstreetbets,TLDR boring
2021-04-17 16:42:04,wallstreetbets,Summary is buy and hold
2021-04-17 16:47:02,wallstreetbets,"As opposed to Citron, Hindenberg is legit. They are the ones who blew the lid off Nikola. CLOV seems like it is up to no good to me."

2021-04-17 18:20:28,wallstreetbets,I kinda have problems understanding why we won't see a significant squeeze here. You said the shorts are sitting at 8-9 dollars and CLOV is currently at that mark. Are you saying that if it won't get significantly above this price level that there won't be any pressure to cover their short positions yet?
2021-04-17 17:41:03,wallstreetbets,"What an absolutely garbage take. Fundamentals do not matter in a squeeze. It has to do with forcing shorts to cover. Not investing because of what it does. Shorts can be forced to cover due to short borrowing fees. GameStop was never actually worth $450. Let alone the $1000 it was headed towards before Robinhood.

Also, we get it. You‚Äôre buttmad Chamath sold his GameStop and ‚Äúbetrayed the apes‚Äù I don‚Äôt care. This is easy money."
2021-04-17 18:40:37,wallstreetbets,Well said.
2021-04-17 17:07:13,wallstreetbets,They barely own any shares. You should be looking at Vanguards position.

2021-04-17 18:40:11,wallstreetbets,People just don't understand the game theory of the market. Not everyone can win. Most of the people in the aftermath of gme/amc would be bagholding just like they were back in VW days.

2021-04-17 17:16:56,wallstreetbets,"Hindenburg is anything but legit.  They've got that one good call in $NKLA and have been wrong about literally everything else.  They're just a hit operation, no different from Scorpion."
2021-04-17 16:53:21,wallstreetbets,They could be using the fame of their past trades to try and manipulate whatever stock they are shorting.

2021-04-17 16:55:35,wallstreetbets,"According to them they don't have a position in CLOV. 

How CLOV makes money is it inflates costs so doctors can charge more to Medicare. It is literally ripping off the government and increasing our costs for healthcare. It was under SEC investigation BEFORE the Hindenberg report--which is something that CLOV and Chamath failed to disclose and this ""DD"" gets wrong...."
2021-04-17 17:21:18,wallstreetbets,Look at the other stocks they've released short reports about. All wrong.
2021-04-17 17:02:44,wallstreetbets,How many of you guys are being paid to be here? This place is trash now. LOL. Flogging CLOV? LOL
2021-04-17 17:50:47,wallstreetbets,GME was pushed to $450 because people like me said it could be done. And doubters like you once again got left in the dust.
2021-04-17 16:59:09,wallstreetbets,"I should probably mention that I actually played puts on this (love you u/NrdRage) but I just wanna read actual fucking DD without a dude screaming out ""ITS A DISTRACTION FROM GMEEEE)"

2021-04-17 17:54:08,wallstreetbets,"""People like you"".

Yeah, I'm sure you're a market mover.

I'll tell you what hotshot:  Me, you, portfolios.  Loser pays the winner 25 million dollars.  I'll have my lawyers draw it up.

That's a 25 million dollar bet I'm calling you out on.  Call the mods.

And, for the record, I made 5 times what DFV did on the GME trade and singlehandedly stopped a short attack a few days before the RH shit by putting up a 14 million dollar buy wall to stem the bleeding.  It was widely discussed here.

Who's ""getting left in the dust now"", dumbass?"
2021-04-17 18:19:19,wallstreetbets,GME hasn‚Äôt even peaked yet lol
2021-04-17 17:28:50,wallstreetbets,Aww then don‚Äôt create a post if you can‚Äôt handle the comments sweetie

2021-04-17 18:04:24,wallstreetbets,Can you link that what you say was widely discussed?
2021-04-17 17:56:46,wallstreetbets,So you‚Äôre claiming you‚Äôre worth $150 million+ and jacking off on WSB?
2021-04-17 17:30:01,wallstreetbets,I'm getting trolled aren't I?
2021-04-17 17:58:18,wallstreetbets,"No, I'm claiming I consider Chamath's net worth ""quaint"", and jacking off on WSB.  My ""I don't care if I blow this account up"" fun money account is 9 figures.

And it's been verified numerous times.  You, on the other hand.

MODS!  I wanna make a bet and this fucker is pussing out."

But sure whatever you wanna tell yourself"
2021-04-17 17:59:15,wallstreetbets,Never claimed I was worth that. If you really dwarf Chamath and are worth a billion dollars I have no idea what you‚Äôre doing on here
2021-04-17 17:33:51,wallstreetbets,or I'm just getting frustrated that people like you dismiss every post that isn't GME. it's like you're in an echo chamber snorting copium all day.
2021-04-17 18:00:36,wallstreetbets,"Getting cheap laughs at people like you who talk out of their neck then crawl under a rock when real power shows up.

2021-04-17 18:05:19,wallstreetbets,"""only worth about 200 million."" Thanks for reminding me I'm poor."
2021-04-17 18:38:55,wallstreetbets,Real power? Did you decide to roleplay as a 10 year old on xbox live today? this entire comment thread is pathetic
2021-04-17 18:04:50,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm certainly not crawling under a rock. Your net worth has nothing to do with any of this. It‚Äôs interesting for sure, but I don‚Äôt understand why you think you can say ‚ÄúI have money‚Äù to win an argument. Besides the novelty I really don‚Äôt care"
2021-04-17 18:09:44,wallstreetbets,"Pretty sure ur the one who led with GME happened because of me like you were king dingaling. You just got put in your place.

2021-04-17 16:34:16,wallstreetbets,You fail to understand that the inflow of money into these ETFs has caused stock movements that no longer represent gains from the contained assets inside but of the etf itself. The ETFs have become too popular and too big for their britches
2021-04-17 17:25:53,wallstreetbets,That video of her farting this week didnt blow up as much I thought it would

2021-04-17 17:14:32,wallstreetbets,"I like me some of that... but let‚Äôs discuss for a sec. Recently she sold Tesla to buy COIN.

What was that about? Previously she had released a new higher price target for Tesla, based on the automated taxi service it could create. However regulators have said that there would still need to be drivers for now and essentially Musk can‚Äôt have AI robot taxis yet.

Is Mama still bullish on Tesla or is she pulling out before earnings? Or is she expecting COIN to moon üåô faster than Tesla? Or is she just reducing the etfs exposure to Tesla?

That‚Äôs my opinion, and why I‚Äôm thinking that I should probably buy Tesla puts before earnings. But idk I‚Äôm torn between calls or puts.

I hate it when mommy and daddy arent together..."
2021-04-17 18:23:23,wallstreetbets,"She got lucky with a few hits like Tesla and Roku that went up quite a lot. But if you match up fund volatility ARKK is is similar to but underperforms TQQQ, a 3x leveraged QQQ ETF. Similar gains with none of the Cathie Wood bullshit. :)

2021-04-17 18:08:44,wallstreetbets,Ok but what does that mean? The value of the etf is not accurately represented?

2021-04-17 16:06:29,wallstreetbets,"Damn homie, she‚Äôs 65"
2021-04-17 18:27:30,wallstreetbets,"I got in early last year and sold out near the peak, I can see this years trend continuing over the next 5 years with constant rates and tax hike talks haven't really been interested in re-entering."
2021-04-17 17:36:55,wallstreetbets,They took a big hit with everything else. Give it time. 2020 got everyone spoiled with almost daily growth.
2021-04-17 18:30:45,wallstreetbets,"Same here. I'm hoping it will eventually turn around. She's still buying this particular stock, so I guess she knows something I'm not seeing..."
2021-04-17 19:23:53,wallstreetbets,She tries to keep certain weights in the funds. She sold some Tesla not all tesla. Tesla had being doing well so as it's price increases its percent weight in the funds also increases. So she has to rebalance. It's normal
2021-04-17 19:22:32,wallstreetbets,"If god saves you thank god and especially her god....trump (not being political, just realistic), in the meantime...tesla is now making US space vehicles, just another wrinkle.

2021-04-17 16:48:19,wallstreetbets,Don't underestimate our horniness
2021-04-17 18:26:01,wallstreetbets,"Basically, as the fund has grown they own a large % of their small caps, they can't get out of these if something happens to them as they are the majority of the liquidity. They would be like an elephant trying to get out of a door (happened to a bunch of funds in the dot com bubble.)

When they have large fund outflows and are forced to sell small caps stocks they can totally kill them. Which can trigger bigger sell-offs in them. 

She has been trying to get more into larger caps but this will drop the performance over time."
2021-04-17 18:25:40,wallstreetbets,"Sort of, the argument made is that simply adding the security to the ETF portfolio boosts the ""value"" of the stock which kind of forms a loop which would eventually cause a fat correction. I don't know to what degree this is correct but I do see people get really excited for a security when it's announced it gets added to a ARK etf"
2021-04-17 18:36:12,wallstreetbets,"Super dummy way of saying it: if all the stock picks inside the ETF go up, this wont go up based on how those stocks went up. Right now the ETF performance is detached from its holdings"

2021-04-17 16:09:51,wallstreetbets,"These are percentages of their vested shares, not their total share amount. In other words, this is just a percentage of their total holdings.

So what this shows is the CFO sold 255K shares but she has over 1.7 million shares in total coming to her, most of which are unvested. So instead of a 100% sale, this is actually more like 15-20%. Which is a totally reasonable divestment when you're talking about this kind of money."

2021-04-17 14:37:14,wallstreetbets,"These are massive sales. Yes it's a DPO, but you'd think if they thought 400-300$ was a great deal of a price they wouldn't sell as much:

Brian Armstrong, CEO -71%

Choi Emilie, Pres -63%

Hass Alesia, CFO -100%

Chatterjee Surojit, CPO (Product) -97%

2021-04-17 19:53:34,wallstreetbets,IPOs like this are a printing press for money for insiders. Of course they are going to sell as many vested shares as they can because they can just print more for themselves later. :)

2021-04-17 19:48:03,wallstreetbets,"What did people expect to happen at $400 a share. Honestly, the valuation is still stretched. The only reason why they're priced at this is because the alternatives aren't great, now. If fidelity and TD step into this space, then things would get bad for them fast. An all encompassing broker for all trading is what's going to cause fear and selling. That's why at 50b+ this to me seems over-valued. I could be wrong, and $COIN doesn't see real competition for a long time, but I doubt someone isn't working out this market now. TD already allows currency pairs, this wouldn't be difficult to set up for them."

2021-04-17 15:09:45,wallstreetbets,"Why wouldn't they try to keep a more substantial or equitable # of shares though? 

Dumping 97% and 100% of your holdings doesn't show any confidence in the future of the business. 

Or looking at it another way, the company isn't ensuring that its top talent and leadership has any incentive to grow the business further; three of them have little to no skin left in the game."

2021-04-17 16:14:44,wallstreetbets,"Those percentages aren't correct relative to their total holdings. This is the percent of shares they have unlocked & vested that they're selling, not the percent of their total holding.  


So yes the CFO is selling 100% of shares available today, 255k of them. But she has about 1.7 million in total that aren't fully vested or are locked: [https://edgar.sec.report/Document/0001209191-21-024217/](https://edgar.sec.report/Document/0001209191-21-024217/)  


So it's not 100%, it's more like 15-20%. Which is a totally reasonable amount to divest when you hold such a concentrated position."

2021-04-17 18:08:40,wallstreetbets,Yeah there was a pretty good post the other day that explained how this insider selling is common for most major companies when you consider that the majority of the c suite comp is in stock options and they have to pay a fuck ton in taxes on these options. It comes out to around 20-30% of their shit and people don‚Äôt understand this.
2021-04-17 16:45:43,wallstreetbets,"True, but the 100% ones still sold basically all the shares they were able to sell.
The options are tied and vested to them if they are still working at Coinbase each month so they aren't fully owned yet."

Usually they sell some to cover taxes. But besides that you can just use that billion in stock as collateral to get a really low interest line of credit for $100 million and spend that on whatever.

The CFO is not the CEO. And in this case, I believe she's a relatively new hire. Again, selling 15% is the correct thing to do, for nearly any stock. Any financial advisor would tell you this. And people who pull in this much all have FA's.

The shylocks in both those pictures remind me of the paid advice specialists that take my money in RRSP's, TFSA's, etc. and stick it in their own pockets while looking for their next donation.  Unfortunately, the general public (including myself) have not very many options when it comes to trying to invest our funds.  In the small amount of time that I have been paying attention to some of these investing columns, I have received huge amounts of free advice on how and what to look for in buying stocks, and continue to do this on a daily basis.  ""**I only trust retards""** is what is making this a more pleasurable route to take my money, and for those out there that are willing to share their wisdom, I applaud them.

2021-04-17 17:02:37,wallstreetbets,"This subreddit is all about thinking outside of the box. Normies in suits don't think outside of the box. There's a reason they're dressed up like that and that's because they want to be accepted by society; hence their thoughts also match them of society. A great example is the big pension funds, look how boring their investments are. Govies, IG credit, property and low risk equities if they're feeling brave. Oh and they hedge a good deal of their rates/inflation exposure. YAAAAAWN. BORING.

Meanwhile, the guy dressed as a wizard already knows he's a complete screwball. He's free to think whatever he wants because people don't expect anything from him. Every day he wakes up knowing his only chance of winning in life is to throw a hail mary. That brings us to this sub. A bunch of guys who may as well be dressed as wizards. Keep swinging guys."

I don't know why the way you dress should be take into account when making assumptions of someone's capabilities. And people in what is assumed to be fancy clothes are the ones that always had lookes down on others from my life experiences..

If the meme was otherwise than I would he surprised."
2021-04-17 18:32:54,wallstreetbets,The left is def a gay porn shoot.
2021-04-17 18:34:10,wallstreetbets,"Okay, memes just have to be funny, not accurate necessarily, but did anybody imagine anything even remotely like the dudes on the left when they first discovered this sub? This isn't the daterape sub."

2021-04-17 18:43:33,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôll take advice from wizards over tooled up metro sexuals any day of the week.....
2021-04-17 18:48:02,wallstreetbets,I would 100% trust the guys on the right more than the guys on the left for financial insight. But I also spent all my stimmy on gme @300 (holding forever btw)
2021-04-17 18:49:56,wallstreetbets,"So good looking men know how to invest is the stereotype here huh? My experience is the exact opposite, and I‚Äôve never imagined anything otherwise"

2021-04-17 16:43:35,wallstreetbets,Probably for the same reason OP thinks that anyone here thinks we get advice from suits.
2021-04-17 16:45:25,wallstreetbets,Because it‚Äôs a retard!

2021-04-17 16:10:05,wallstreetbets,Waistcoat and no jacket outside...absolutely not people I would take advice from
2021-04-17 17:55:05,wallstreetbets,"and GOB sank the yacht, listen to his great advice!"

2021-04-17 13:47:03,wallstreetbets,"Never said it is negative. I would rather trust a wizard.
Also I am retarded, so it's not a financial advice."
2021-04-17 16:32:51,wallstreetbets,Yeah the second picture should be a bunch of pasty overweight/underweight guys with scraggly beards hanging out in their underwear in their parent's basement.

- Successful doctor who moved across the country but was still included in the wedding party for nostalgias sake
- Bottom level business analyst who day trades and always talks about his latest win but is actually down 20% if you up all his investments"

2021-04-17 14:08:38,wallstreetbets,True. Never trust a guy in a suit. I trust wizards. They are fucking muggles. They aint know shit.
2021-04-17 14:32:48,wallstreetbets,"Actually if you consider the definition of a basic bitch then yes. Yes I would agree these are very likely base-operational units with no DLC or personality mods enabled.

* Revenues were $309.0 million, an increase of 12.1% sequentially from $275.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, higher than the guidance of around 5-10% sequential increase. This represents an increase of 67.4% year-over-year.
* Gross margin was 40.2%, exceeding the guidance of around 37-38%. This represents an increase of 9.0 percentage points sequentially and an increase of 17.5 percentage points compared to the same period last year.
* IFRS earnings per diluted ADS were expected to be around 38.3 cents, exceeding the guidance of 30.0 cents to 34.0 cents. This compares to 19.5 cents in the previous quarter and 1.9 cents in the same period last year. IFRS net profit reached $66.9 million during the quarter.
* Non-IFRS earnings per diluted ADS were expected to be around 38.4 cents, exceeding the guidance of 30.1 cents to 34.1 cents. This compares to 19.7 cents in the previous quarter and 2.2 cents in the same period last year. Non-IFRS net profit reached $67.1 million during the quarter."

2021-04-17 14:53:02,wallstreetbets,In all fairness this shouldn‚Äôt be compared to gme other than it could short squeeze. Clover is a legitimate company disrupting its sector with tech. Even without a massive attack on shorts this would have proved itself by earnings. Anyone who owns this under $15 will double their money by 2022 and that again is without the massive short attack. The short squeeze is just accelerating what would have happened anyways.

2021-04-17 14:42:21,wallstreetbets,Check out the 'The Lucky Clover' DD on WSB. Yes the SI from S3 which is from FactSet has been debunked. But that is just a technical matter. The Public float is insanely small. Insiders hold 75+% of shares. the remaining amount of shares is a lot less than the amount of shorted shares.

I assume you apes have had a little exposure to the Cell & Gene Therapy (C&GT) industry when you're jerkin off on the couch to Cathie Woods and her $ARKG fund while your wife and her boyfriend are in the master bedroom, but then again probably not.  So, please read the preamble before throwing your shit all over my DD.

**Key Points on Cell and Gene Therapy Industry**

C&GT is a long time in the making and many (including several Nobel prize winning) discoveries had to coalesce but the industry is finally starting to hit major inflection points. One of the major subcategories within C&GT are ""cell-based gene therapies"" like CAR-T cell therapy. A patient's (or donor's) T cell is genetically engineered to express a CAR which drives the T cell towards the cancer cells. There are 5 FDA approved CAR-T cell therapies on the market. Below is a table from Wikipedia with more info on them.

https://preview.redd.it/wk1h7t06sqt61.png?width=2228&format=png&auto=webp&s=798b37452937b4018f93f1939d5794ca80d2fc1a

There are many other subcategories within C&GT and many other types of ""cell-based gene therapies"" beyond CAR-T cell therapy.  Not all of these require genetic engineering, FYI.

On January 15, 2019 commissioners from the [FDA issued a bullish statement](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/statement-fda-commissioner-scott-gottlieb-md-and-peter-marks-md-phd-director-center-biologics) on the C&GT industry and here are some highlights:

1. ""The FDA is witnessing a surge of cell and gene therapy products entering early development, evidenced by a large upswing in the number of investigational new drug (IND) applications.""
2. ""We anticipate that by 2020 we will be receiving more than 200 INDs per year, building upon our total of more than 800 active cell-based or directly administered gene therapy INDs currently on file with the FDA.""
3. ""And by 2025, we predict that the FDA will be approving 10 to 20 cell and gene therapy products a year based on an assessment of the current pipeline and the clinical success rates of these products.

&#x200B;

When you look at the [FDA's IND Receipts for Biologics](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/ind-activity/ind-receipts) in 2018, we see that 1594 INDs were filed. This was a below average year compared to the 1614 (+/-70) INDs that were filed, on average, from 2014 through 2019. It is important to remember that there was a ""surge"" of C&GT products entering the early development landscape BEFORE the pandemic because this implies that the share of C&GT IND receipts is growing in a pie of \~1600 new INDs per year. In 2020, the FDA received 2182 INDs.

The ""surge"" in C&GT products entering early development the FDA noted in their early 2019 statement was a mere prelude to the 2020 surge in C&GT therapy products entering early development as evidenced by large upswings in the number of new INDs.

Unfortunately, there are many risks involved with investing in early, mid, or late stage biologic drug developers because of their high cash burn rate and constant threat of dilution. Obviously the tendies can be nice if some of these companies get acquired but that's a tough game to play. IMO, you are much better off finding a company that provides the C&GT industry with all the reagents, consumables, and instruments that these developers and institutions use to conduct R&D and development work. **Enter, $TECH**.

[Bio-techne](https://www.bio-techne.com/) is a NE Minneapolis, MN based company that has largely grown through acquisitions. It's largest subsidiary is R&D Systems, a company that has been providing research grade reagents to the biotech industry for 50 years. That brand is well known and have a great reputation. They have quietly acquired many other brands quite strategically which will enable them to service the growing C&GT industry new ways like: GMP reagents for use in the expanding clinical and commercial landscape, gene editing technology (including CRISPR/Cas9 and other non-viral methods), contract development and manufacturing services, analytical instrumentation and assays, etc. [See here for full list of Bio-techne brands.](https://www.bio-techne.com/about/bio-techne-brands) 

 

**The Metaphorical Stars Align**

Not only is $TECH a fundamentally sound company with strong analyst reviews (see my E\*Trade snapshot below), but stars are soon to be aligning that you apes need to be aware of.

&#x200B;

**On 4/20, $TECH will break through its $420 resistance**. I mean come on, this is too good to be true right? See my shitty technical analysis below for confirmation bias. Everything seems to be lining up.

Here are my holdings of $TECH.

 **TL;DR:** If you like $EDIT, $ARKG, or any other hot cell and gene therapy companies like $CRSP, $FATE, etc. but do not want to invest in cell and gene therapy developers directly (because of risk), then $TECH is for you. Not only has $TECH supported the biotech field with reagents, assays, and instrumentation for 40 years, they will continue to take market share in the rapidly growing clinical/commercial (non-R&D) groups. Finally, their stonk will break through the $420 resistance on 4/20."

# TL;DR

`Heutagogy - self-determined learning, is a student-centered instructional strategy that emphasizes the development of autonomy, capacity, and capability`

`Pedagogy - the method and practice of teaching, especially as an academic subject or theoretical concept.`

Roblox is fundamentally an education company that encourages students to learn modern-day equivalents of typing on a computer. These skills involve things like learning how to code, develop art, or strong communication skills. =

As part of our business strategy, we have made and intend to make acquisitions to add specialized employees and complementary companies, features, and technologies. For example, in 2020 we acquired Ceebr Limited, a company that operated a platform that teaches children age 6-13 to design, program, and play their own games."" - Roblox S-1

# Purpose

To be frank, I was surprised by the hunger for knowledge and I really enjoyed debating some of the rather brazen people here. WSB has grown and in my view, our committed analysts can crush Wall Street analysts at places like Morningstar or M-Fool. We have on-the-ground experience as laborers, customers, and digital-natives that they often filter out of a privileged ignorance.

Part of this is also due to the fact that I believe that investing in securities will become increasingly complex yet accessible for a typical retail investor which will either result in isolation or cooperation.

* Does the average retail investor really understand the core regulatory influences in investments like Square, PayPal, or even rob-the-hood? **(Square DD Complete)**
* How do we compare social media incentives? **(Pinterest DD Complete)**
* What really is customer service? **(GameStop DD Complete)**
* Are we familiar with new international trades that increase Mexican-Texan manufacturing? **(Kansas City Southern Rail DD Complete)**
* What are elements behind US lagging industrial sector? **(Autodesk DD Complete)**
* Do we understand the consequences of STEAM education (Science, technology, engineering, arts, mathematics)? **(YOU ARE HERE)**
* Is the average retail investor familiar with the network models that govern software like Fastly and Twilio? **(Cloud Compute DD in Progress)**
* How knowledgable are we of fashion trends that make Nike and Foot Locker valuable?

At the end of the day, I am an educator and I believe that the goal of education is to engage a reader into a deeper curiosity or discussion, so that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm sharing my writing. I‚Äôm not here to convince you that this stock is even a good choice - but to explore the economics behind it.

# Video Games & Heutagogic Learning

It appears clear these days that video games are the most dominant form of media. This is because the video game industry can better access and more aggressively capture our high-barrier entry need for adventure and journey. Other industries compete with this element but ultimately place their customers in the spectator's seat. For example:

1. The short stories on social media like Snapchat, Instagram, Youtube, or Twitter.
2. The hero tales created by Disney or Netflix.

&#x200B;

[Gaming as the leader in entertainment or media](https://preview.redd.it/xms6g6ksvpt61.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=e84e0655c99280e464931f3da513e33404fbdee6)

One must remember that the attention-economy fundamentally depends on on key metric: **engagement**. It is no secret why organizations like Facebook, Google, Microsoft, or even Tesla have further intersected with gaming in aggressive maneuvers in recent years as a result of this economic condition. Gaming is a big winner of the attention-economy and often sits at the frontier of new economies.  When looking at age, gaming or other medias can be the shortest path to reaching new or lifelong customers. It is a lucrative and difficult position to acquire or maintain.

&#x200B;

Think of it historically; during the first iterations of the web, many customers were fearful of putting credit-card information online while online gaming companies have ventured into selling branded debit cards that sold to children and youth that otherwise did not have access to banking. Roblox takes this nature a step further by effectively defining and supporting Robux-to-fiat economy as the lifeblood of the company.

&#x200B;

[First generation fintech and banking services](https://preview.redd.it/72qme0crxpt61.png?width=353&format=png&auto=webp&s=cadb26b801c61afe73a8a96cb16a0024c66e316b)

I‚Äôve discussed internet media, user incentives, and their distinctions in a previous DD involving Pinterest. To highlight one of main ideas:

>""An internet forum may take on a different medium, but it is ultimately a forum none the less. In my view, it ranks like the following list, where the top rank is the most inelastic due to human behavior. If we try to categorize it roughly, the forums would look like this:

1. Google is fueled by customer‚Äôs need for answered information.
2. Online video games are fueled by a customer‚Äôs need for adventure.
3. Reddit is fueled by a customer‚Äôs need for community.
4. Pinterest is fueled by a customer‚Äôs need for ideas.
5. Facebook is fueled by a customer‚Äôs need to connect.""

In this DD, I would argue that gaming is one of the most comprehensive applications of internet forums that can encapsulate all of the needs above and dig deeper into the ideas that drive it.

&#x200B;

[The investment incentive: low barrier to entry & decentralized game development](https://preview.redd.it/hmibns2pzpt61.png?width=1303&format=png&auto=webp&s=a08c1a1680665d6f9272f3cff8ab19bb68f3f3ed)

I typically do not like to assert authority on a subject when I write DD, but I feel that in this case it is necessary due to an enormous complexities behind education technology, what's wrong with it, and what needs to be corrected.  In short, my view is that video games are one of the most powerful ways to engage students in a meaningful and long-lasting education, ranging from social to reading skills.

&#x200B;

[Heutagogic learning](https://preview.redd.it/rq9dxj9yzpt61.png?width=591&format=png&auto=webp&s=c4fbe53adde74b85313ca4dca53077e14de64983)

Online games fulfill a similar shortcoming that traditional medias fail in regards to adventure or journey.  In the same fashion, education and the art of teaching generally stutters when the student remains a spectator for too long.  What gaming achieves as an education service are all the critical requirements of a healthy STEM education:

&#x200B;

1. The ability to inspire curiosity and confidence.
2. The ability to deeply engage.
3. The ability to produce imagination or creativity.

Some of us may scoff about this, but there is a lot of truth to this sentiment that I believe many would agree with. For many early online child gamers, skills like typing quickly, bartering, multiplying, reading comprehension, or the desire to pursue arts originates from our time spent engaged by video games.

This is the goal and nature of heutagogic learning. This nature extends to adulthood, as many of us experienced this phenomenon while learning about advanced financial instruments for the sake of ""learning the game""  of stock market investing. We spend time scowering through forums and generating a community no different than that of popular online games.  Many of us have even acquired generational knowledge as a result of this media condition. We have met the proper requirements and incentives for a STEM education at scale.

[Andragogic\/Heutagogic learning at scale](https://preview.redd.it/gplo1bx41qt61.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=715bae2a0ff447bd5d21569bcac401c636c69dae)

I could talk length about this subject alone, but simply put, the world is not quite ready to accept such an idea. Games are still seen as entertainment, but it typically evolves each generation. In my generation, three societal transformations occurred:

1. It stopped being weird to purchase in-game cosmetics.
2. The idea of watching others play video games was normalized.
3. E-Sports became popular and inspired a new economy.

&#x200B;

[Second generation online gaming](https://preview.redd.it/4bt555i62qt61.png?width=570&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c281084802f3ff72cb8143b40761bde4fa9e5ed)

Some of these resistances are interesting when you look at it from a simpler lens. Why was it weird to watch others play video games online, when it was seemingly normal to watch someone play Dance Dance Revolution in an arcade or an older sibling progress through a game? Why was it strange to purchase cosmetic goods where we spend a large percentage of our time in digital worlds? Why was it bizarre to see dedicated players compete at global levels when gaming and online access became a worldwide normalcy? Usually there is no good reason for the psychological resistance to change.

Yet here we are, playing and learning effectively one of the most popular mobile games in the US.

&#x200B;

# STEAM Pedagogy - Arts in STEM

&#x200B;

[STEAM pedagogy for architecture, engineering, or construction](https://preview.redd.it/b57peu7j2qt61.png?width=2782&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e6ce51e01691091ff6dbeee88ff1dad985a2ff7)

With that idea covered, I want to transition to examine one of the leading pedagogies in US education, which is the inclusion of arts in STEM, known as a STEAM pedagogy.  It may not be immediately clear why the inclusion is such a drastic change to STEM, but one should consider several factors:

1. STEM education standards are poor with low engagement (a societal problem)
2. Good science and engineering requires confident students (resisting imposter syndrome)
3. STEM requires creativity and imagination (critical thinking requisites)

&#x200B;

[Game development, code, or design](https://preview.redd.it/556dqhnp3qt61.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=e6b4a2ac6c89a435890fcd01210026208aae9337)

What an arts education does is fundamentally produce new language and learning skills that are actively applied in a STEM education. Typically speaking, arts is also far more engaging to youth while traditional STEM learning models can carry less obvious inherent incentives.

However, slowly but surely, we are beginning to see students who seek to learn digital art, coding, investing and other STEAM-derived interests that can transition into other branches of STEM as a result of incentivizing the desire to learn these skills.

A young Roblox game developer is only a short path away from finding a passion in architecture or cloud computing. This strategy is not new and has had success for organizations like Adobe, Microsoft, Autodesk, and other technical skills. These are largely andragogic forms of learning, or adult-centered educations.

&#x200B;

One of the most significant accomplishments of the inclusion of Arts in a STEM-centered education is the inversion of a question that afflicted many classrooms for generations:

>‚ÄúWhy do I need to learn this?‚Äù

It turns out, the answer is not

>‚Äúso you can become a scientist!‚Äù

but to provide an environment that encourages and incentivizes a proper learner's mentality

>‚ÄúI need to learn this, so that I can create that.‚Äù

Engineers and scientists are simply disciplined creators no different than an artist or performer. However, there are significant and clear barriers to entry to STEM-based and Arts-based learning. It is far more pragmatic for a child to inspire creative behaviors with a canvas, skateboard, or instrument while the barrier to entry for engineering practices may be far less accessible.

Some of this is partially a consequence of time, where there has been less knowledge transfer on writing software vs. writing prose and some of these barriers have compounding consequences at the socioeconomic level.  For example, there is a large disparity in big tech hirings, and such consequences can carry over to other multi-trillion dollar industries driven by infrastructure and Green New Deal policies.

&#x200B;

[Socioeconomic consequences in education support](https://preview.redd.it/t2mh2ikz3qt61.png?width=987&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ed2aadf47bb21e36d44864efe58303c20119d74)

Another huge barrier to entry to STEM is simply the fact that many students do not believe in themselves or have not been encouraged to imagine that they are capable of achieving success in subjects like mathematics and science, so there is an enormous amount of undue self-filtering in the field. Learning how to dance is a far more engaging practice to a child, while learning how to code in some developer environment without the proper incentive may seem pointless. Organizations like Roblox can and are changing the equation for some students.

You may be at a loss at this point, but it's worth taking the time to simply ponder on this and what it means economically for Roblox. The language used here is directly aligned with the language used in the Roblox S-1 registration document:

1. Inspiration mentioned 9 times.
2. Create and inspiration mentioned 75 times.
3. Engagement mentioned 160 times.

This language is particular due to the game identifying with its original iteration, Interactive Physics, an education game that launched in 1989.

>""The story of Roblox began in 1989 when our founders, David Baszucki and Erik Cassel, programmed a 2D simulated physics lab called Interactive Physics, which would later go on to influence our approach to building the groundwork for Roblox. Students across the world used Interactive Physics to see how two cars would crash, or how they could build destructible houses. In starting Roblox in 2004, we wanted to replicate the inspiration of imagination and creativity we saw in Interactive Physics on a much grander scale by ushering in a new category of human interaction that did not exist at the time.""

# The Roblox Vision

>""We focus our business on our developers, creators, and users, and acting in their interests in the long-term may conflict with the short-term expectations of analysts and investors.""

&#x200B;

[EBP - Engagement Based Payouts started in 2020](https://preview.redd.it/z63prfzr6qt61.png?width=467&format=png&auto=webp&s=faad3efe3a156c1f26e4adadefb20346466bb37e)

Understanding the nature of modern-day cloud computing and its future direction will allow investors to understand the paths that Roblox will take. The fundamental theory of this economy is that a customer's data is an increasingly tangible asset. The way that I like to examine the economic output of this industry is by two core economic elements.

1. The value of work generated by machine-to-machine transactions (network output).
2. The value of data and services generated by human experiences (customer input).

[Serverless computing - network service architecture for real-time and powerful apps.](https://preview.redd.it/wl88yq547qt61.png?width=1376&format=png&auto=webp&s=618f6be99e0b7cc157065b4505cb82d7f89d5e36)

There are many organizations that capture the essence of this industry. Organizations like Square and Zoom will provide services that we're all familiar with, but we often forget the under-hood-details that exist and govern the infrastructure of these companies. What cloud computing organizations have realized is that as our engagement with platforms increases, the value of our data and needs becomes increasingly tangible. Our needs for financial technology or property rentals have resulted in regulatory or social challenges, which we typically refer to as ""disruption"". The disruption is rooted in the fact that our data is an authentically tangible good.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vpzpov6deqt61.png?width=845&format=png&auto=webp&s=0128b3dd2ee4912161dbfc99c9d312b8f57f9b6c

&#x200B;

This idea that our data and time spent on digital platforms is the central hypothesis behind creation of the robux system that Roblox lives on. There are many things that Roblox needs to accomplish in the near to short term to achieve long-term profitability and the leadership seems to have a clear vision on how to achieve that:

1. The company will continue to redistribute its wealth back toward its developers.
2. The company will aggressively invest in education sectors to incentivize students to learn valuable skills.
3. The company will support wildly successful games as a way to create a long-term identity for Roblox (like popular Nintendo games)
4. The company will continue to invest in its cloud platform and eventually develop its own hardware platform to reduce its expenses.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/jr21jf1b8qt61.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=8175cc302d2be55fe0e446f0b78dc71d6f1d4956

The reason that I'm certain of this is because the organization needs to accomplish the following incentives and financial feats:

1. Reached a large enough audience in order to maintain long-term relevancy.
2. Produced and support games that create enough incentive to join the platform.
3. Created enough incentives for developers to produce quality experiences.

&#x200B;

>""Roblox has a vibrant economy built on a currency called Robux, which can be purchased through the Roblox Client and website. Users can also acquire Robux through a monthly subscription to Roblox  
>  
>Premium. Developers and creators earn Robux by selling access to virtual content. Developers can also earn Robux by driving engagement of Premium subscribers through an engagement-based payout system. When Premium subscribers spend time in a developer‚Äôs experience, that developer earns a prorated share of the user‚Äôs monthly subscription fee. Engagement-based payouts incentivize developers to invest in the engagement of their experiences. Roblox allows developers and creators to convert earned Robux into the real-world currency of their choice through our Developer Exchange Program.""

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/h95ts6pt8qt61.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=0406e17772f8f302bfdc4beb4eee288509e07440

In my view, Roblox's 2020 premium payout system will be one the biggest shifts in media as it has many potential outcomes that we aren't fully implemented yet. This is the nature of certain powerful architectures like computing more data at the edge or leaning on services like Fastly, Amazon Fargate, or other serverless/back-end platforms. Roblox is no such stranger to this and I would say that they certaintly have a vested interest in pushing these kinds of interactions.

Some uses cases of engagement-based payouts are repeatable to other platforms, where organizations like Reddit could easily implement similar financial logic if they discover that Reddit Subscribers spend the majority of their time to a small concentration of subreddits. This already exists to an extent, where users represent engagement through coin-sharing and reddit emoji placements.

Another example, if a high-quality education game were to be released on Roblox, where the developer agrees to redistribute their earned Robux to schools in need, then Roblox has achieved an economy where a student who is spending time learning has resulted in the improvement or construction of other learning facilities. This is also reflective of the idea that data is increasingly tangible.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bb9j3yj7aqt61.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=8308e21dd05757fa74928a26560f665d0d61bf12

The possibilities with an engagement-based payout system are enormous for Roblox and produces added value to the ideas behind things like virtual concerts, streams, or other experiences that aren't fully realized in the gaming sector. For example, what is the economic consequence of children having a safe environment to attend concerts of their favorite artists? At the same time, the Robux payout system is a non-trivial distance away from creating applications of other alternative currencies like exchanging Robux with other digital assets like VBucks, tickets, or block-you-know-what-based applications.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1g33ivkwaqt61.png?width=300&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6ff4e2b37801f0ee02fa70d46b8fa636bc5455b

Another core element to Roblox's financial future is to ultimately secure its means of distribution. As it currently stands, the biggest expense to the Roblox platform is the fee processing it must agree to when it comes to doing business with organizations like Apple, Microsoft, Google, and other payment processors like Visa and Paypal. One way to reduce these costs and increase profitability is to develop products akin to the Nintendo Switch or Oculus platform. This idea is not too far away given the nature of Roblox's business, which has an enormous amount of various types of games that would be well-suited by Roblox partnerships. Overtime, the value of Apple or Google's distribution power weakens as the company cements itself into public consciousness.

&#x200B;

The company has alluded to this idea with an April fool's joke in 2019, with a console known as the imagination-powered Robox:

>"" At Roblox, we‚Äôre continuously exploring new and innovative ways to bring our platform to millions of people across the world. Just as we‚Äôve expanded onto phones, tablets, the Xbox One, and virtual reality, we believe that there‚Äôs an even greater potential just waiting to be unlocked. A new way to experience all your favorite Roblox games. A new way to connect with your friends. A new way to make your dreams a reality in stunning, 8K ultra-high definition graphics and at greater than 120 frames per second.  
>  
>Welcome to a new era of interactive entertainment. This is **Robox**.""

# Conclusion

There was a lot of ground to cover here so let's briefly review. Gaming is arguably the best form of media in the attention-economy where Roblox identifies itself at the intersection of education and digital media development.

A significant portion of the education sector is focused on STEAM pedagogy which aligned with and supported by Roblox goals long-term. Roblox is able to leverage cloud computing to disrupt traditional models in gaming, education, financial technology, and imagination markets.

2021-04-17 09:50:16,wallstreetbets,"Super interesting. Do you have a background in child education? I‚Äôve never seen the STEAM acronym before but it really nails what I‚Äôve been seeing play out in education/workforce/human capital debates - particularly in developing countries and places like China and Singapore, where there‚Äôs an abundance of STEM geniuses but a gap in innovation. Kids need to learn creativity along with their STEM. Video games are the training ground where that happens. I don‚Äôt know why schools keep trying to shoehorn art into STEM-leaning curriculums. Video game developers already have that figured out to the point where it‚Äôs entirely holistic.

My 5 year old is already using Whatsapp, playing Roblox and Minecraft and stuff (and trying to crack my Xbox account password, haha). He‚Äôs  light years beyond me - I just lack the neural plasticity as an adult to jump in and keep up. It‚Äôs pretty amazing what kids can pick up from playing video games. I guess I was the same way but never really thought about it at the time. I don‚Äôt see the reason parents still hold back their kids from too much ‚Äúscreen time‚Äù as long as it‚Äôs active learning and not passive. Play is a child‚Äôs work, as my mom says (she‚Äôs a child edu specialist)."

Everything else is just noise. The only important thing is the demand for Robux. And the only people who demand Robux are the gamers to purchase things on the platform or developers trying to advertise their game on Roblox/create groups/create avatar clothing etc. I have had a lot of experience with Roblox, it's a great platform but the stock is ridiculously overvalued."

2021-04-17 15:24:01,wallstreetbets,"Im of the opposite mind actually im not sure why they aren‚Äôt turning a profit and was surprised when that was revealed. 

I dont see any issues with their core product at all and they have an absolutely **massive** playerbase with 164 million *monthly* users.

Surprisingly too they have more older users than one would expect with only 64% of their users being less than 16 and a surprising 14% being 25 and over.

The product is definitely attracting the repetitive player-base needed to be a winner, if I were to guess there‚Äôs just either a management problem or they‚Äôre still in a huge growth period, the latter of which is fine and justifies their losses.

I think long term RBLX is going to be a winner, but its not worth buying at current prices. Personally im waiting for a better purchasing price."

It should continue to grow and penetrate many industries if not create one of its own, but it may still be met with some resistance because it‚Äôs new and seemingly ephemeral. In a lot of ways, it‚Äôs success is dependent on the general public being and remaining genuinely interested in new and obscure methods that enrich lives and not regressing to the status quo. The trajectory looks good but history tells us otherwise. It‚Äôs a crude example that I‚Äôm too lazy to expand on, but hopefully you kinda get the idea of the bearish case.

2021-04-17 17:25:41,wallstreetbets,"Roblox is amazing, my daughter convinced me to try it since one of her schoolfriends also plays with her dad. It's a lot of fun, some of it is really simple and remind you of older flash tower defence games (but they are awesome) there are tycoon games my daughter made me try one, the only reason I didn't start buying Robux after 15 minutes was that it kept giving an error when I was at the choose method of payment screen.

&#x200B;

I'm usually a total war gamer and a mount&blade and football manager gamer. But Roblox has some really fun stuff. And yes it's also immensely popular with kids her entire school and all the kids at her programming class (one of her hobbies) are very much into it. When she turned 10 she was allowed to have a sleepover party with friends and they all slept in the living room. At one point around 4 AM my wife went downstairs because she heard something. They had turned my pc on, and my daughter's pc and where playing Roblox on it and then 3 other girls where also playing roblox on their phones.

&#x200B;

I wouldn't underestimate it. It's obviously a question how the monetization will play out. But the market share conquering is locked down if you ask this gamer dad"
2021-04-17 15:57:51,wallstreetbets,"Yeah because they have already identified those artworks as part of their brand. GTA wasn't so clear 20 years ago. Roblox still has to formulate it's identified brand.

On that note, minecraft and roblox are one of most popular games in history and it hasn't seemed to slow down. The child market has also supported other behemoths like Disney and YouTube for example."

2021-04-17 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"SriusXM getting closer to being standard on US vehicles SiriusXM radios will be installed this year on about 80% of all manufactured autos in this country.  This means that about 13 M vehicles are going to have siriusxm radio with production at 16 M in 2021. 

What is even more exciting that siriusxm is now standard in a number of manufacturers.  The most recent is Jaguar/Land Rover.

Moreover, about 4.5 M autos of the estimated 16 M produced this year will feature 360L, an interactive wi-fi radio that will enable the company to increase retention and introduce targeted ads.

2021-04-17 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"The Lucky Clover üçÄ Edit: There have been multiple observations about $CLOV true short interest (different numbers from FactSet, S3 Partners, Bloomberg). As it's always the case, there is a lot of noise and the numbers I have are not watertight, so you should do your own work. What seems to hold though, is that $CLOV has been agressively beaten down by bears.

TL;DR  üçÄ go brrrrr üöÄüöÄüöÄ

Howdy degenerates!

I bet you saw the price action in $CLOV yesterday (+20%)? Turns out the shorts got greedy again -- close to 120% greedy.

What??? Haven't they learnt their lesson with $GME at once? Apparently not. The $GME squeeze has cost a bunch of hedge funds (Melvin, Maplelane, D1) billions in losses on top of their damaged reputation and 'prestige'.

These hedge funds hold a lot of grudge towards a few people that chipped in during the $GME squeeze of January 2021 -- namely Chamath. See excerpt from Greenlight Capital (David Einhorn's hedge fund) letter:

[Einhorn's April 15 letter to investors](https://preview.redd.it/f54gnkshapt61.png?width=1254&format=png&auto=webp&s=f408458520ba063250597ad9c2e270e73eddfb75)

Their weapon of choice -- shorting $CLOV, which was SPACed by Chamath.

Isn‚Äôt $CLOV a pos stock? No, and even if it is, this is irrelevant. As you already figured it out, most short squeezes are mostly math, however this may or may not unfold.

**$CLOV Short Interest:**

$CLOV has 118% short interest. Shorts will try an tell you that this is much lower. In fact that's exactly what Hindenburg tried to do yesterday. Hindenburg even e-mailed FactSet to counter S3 Partners data (although S3 calculation also seems to be incorrect). The table below is based on Clover's 10K + latest 13G filed by Vanguard, so should be very close to reality:

https://preview.redd.it/osbjmrweapt61.png?width=1324&format=png&auto=webp&s=77d1b36c6532e3d7e569cec2021a3fc7de03b37e

[This includes CEO's shares in the float -- it shouldn't. ](https://preview.redd.it/ypfw5kulapt61.png?width=862&format=png&auto=webp&s=49333325388e5108d6af6c4b6d5b9b15c797c210)

Shorts are intentionally including CEO's shares into the float to make it appear larger. This is boneheaded at best and intentionally deceitful at worst:

* The CEO (Vivek Garipalli) is the founder of $CLOV; the likelihood of him selling his shares is close to nil
* All his shares are Class B (10-to-1 voting ratio vs. Class A; only Class A shares are traded on the open market -- so they shouldn't be in the calculation in the first place), which means that if he sells or transfers his shares this will generally result in those shares converting to Class A (i.e. losing the supervoting feature)
* Even if he would decide to sell, the shares are still locked-up until July
* Management incentive plan is anchored at $30 per share. What this means is that the share price has to exceed $30 for 90 consecutive days in order for management plan RSUs to vest and be possible to sell

***What does this mean?***

What this means is that a very small amount of $CLOV shares are free to trade because \~78% of the shares are still owned by insiders, locked-up and not trading. It only takes a little bit of gamma fairy dust to make $CLOV move A LOT.

**Timing:**

Timing this is tricky. $CLOV is due to announce results on May 20th, so save for any good news, this would be our catalyst. 

To capture the biggest upside, the highest strike call options are the best for this. Currently the only May expiry options are 5/21 $30C (still cheap at $0.2). There is A LOT of calls OI for that date.

Inducing some gamma fairy dust so that MMs have to hedge with more shares, making the shorts cover, increasing the Delta of our call options further, would help getting there and beyond.

Remember $CLOV ATH was $17.45 -- even if ALL shorts opened positions at that level, they would be 70% underwater if it hits $30. If you add leverage (all hedge funds are levered), say 2x -- they would be looking at a forced cover / liquidation √† la Archegos.

Obligatory: I am a financial degenerate and this is for entertainment purposes only; not investment advice.

https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/msm6ik/clov_some_numbers_and_the_hope_of_another_squeeze/

I posted over here in case anyone wants further confirmation bias. All i got was a jackass who didnt read tell me to go read something completely unrelated. 

In all senses clov should fly. It has a bull flag chart pattern, it has the massive shorting, the low float and the crazy amount of call volume."
2021-04-17 06:26:36,wallstreetbets,We need more people to know about the data.
2021-04-17 09:25:41,wallstreetbets,It had 250 million volume on Friday. What to make of that? Was that covering of shorts or a gamma squeeze?
2021-04-17 12:42:11,wallstreetbets,"Guess I'm buying some of this in addition to my GME. I'm curious if this is a bait though where shorts know they have a two week window? Looks to me just by looking at the graph that they covered  when someone noticed the short interest percent, in 2 weeks it'll be known if they actually did. I'll pick some up but thats it"

2021-04-17 11:11:15,wallstreetbets,"Going to try to hijack this post to give those who don‚Äôt know what Clov is trying to do And what‚Äôs makes them different 
You ever go to a doctor (pcp) and the doctor send you to a specialist. A lot of the times, not all the time , they ailment is minor and could possible be taken care of by the pcp. Especially if they had a lot of data on there patient. 
That‚Äôs what Clov is trying to do. They are providing there software to the pcp‚Äôs. So that they can prevent patients from being sent to the over priced specialist. 
They are incentivizing the pcps by paying them more per patient to use there software 
Paying them more than other insurance companies that cap them at a certain amount. 
Spoke to my wife about this.  As she been in the medical field for 10 years. And she says the doctors are a lot of time limited to what the insurance companies will let them do. 
Limit the care to the patients. I believe Clov is trying to change this also 
If they can make this work the pcp will make more yes but insurance cost will go down do to the lesser need to go to specialist when your pcp has all the data they need to be your, most of the time, one stop shop. 
Hope I made sense"

2021-04-17 10:10:56,wallstreetbets,If you could go back and buy  GME at $9 a share you would be rich right now. This is your next best chance to get those kind of returns.
2021-04-17 07:01:42,wallstreetbets,"I like the stock, but these squeeze plays are very unpredictable. A few of the factors affecting this stock.

1. Hindenburg short report. CLOV responded to the report, but the market has not responded favorably. It‚Äôs rather beat down.  Your opinion may vary on Hindenburg, mine is that they are a bit of a mixed bag, and not reliable. 

2. It ran last Thursday (4/08) on news that they are in 10 states doing direct contracting (seems to be a test model for 2021) through Medicare. This seems counterintuitive that they would be included in this new model if they are under DOJ investigation. Source: https://innovation.cms.gov/media/document/gpdc-model-participant-announcement

3.  Demetrios Kouzoukas is joining the board. According to the CEO, ‚ÄúHe has an encyclopedic knowledge of Medicare rules and regulations, combined with an incredibly astute business and strategy acumen.‚Äù  What is interesting to me is that he will serve on the Audit Committee.  Source: https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/04/15/2210944/0/en/Demetrios-Kouzoukas-Former-Director-of-the-Center-for-Medicare-and-Principal-Deputy-Administrator-of-CMS-Joins-Board-of-Clover-Health.html

4. ‚ÄúShort Interest‚Äù  This is difficult to calculate. I agree with OP that CEO‚Äôs shares should not be in the float, since they are locked up. You should know that smart shorts will hedge their bet with calls.  So I never bet on a short squeeze.

Edited to clarify point 2."
2021-04-17 09:11:05,wallstreetbets,"Makes sense for the bears to force this down. The catalyst are on there side as of now.
DOJ investigation with PR quite as ever. But this is one of those stock that can potential flip to the bulls instantly. There has been positive catalyst coming out but none that outweigh the negative yet. And bears have gotten greedy. The pressure is building and it‚Äôs ready to pop. Once doj investigation is dropped this will run. It will run hard!
So whether it is squeezed or not. This is going to be good to those who are patient 
IMO"

2021-04-17 09:49:15,wallstreetbets,I love CLOV. I made the easiest 160% gain ever buying 0dte $9p near the peak yesterday.
2021-04-17 11:42:26,wallstreetbets,"CLOV Form 8-K from April 13 shows that their new board member, Demetrios Kouzoukas, has Call options at $11.50. Fintel shows Chamath has Calls at $10 along with the rest of the insiders. The big players are all vested in making CLOV successful, and the speculation that I've seen indicates a $19/share valuation by next year. **I already view CLOV as a company with strong growth potential, and I strongly believe it will be trading above $15 by Q1 2022.** The basis of my target is their expected customer growth and revenue increase. **This is regardless of a short squeeze, which will temporarily inflate the price of stock.**

CLOVer Health Investments is currently an ugly prospect thanks to recent bad press and a lawsuit. The company remains optimistic to double their customer base during the next year after hiring Kouzoukas (Do your DD. Personally, I believe this is likely in the current political climate). The mainstream media is trying really hard to connect Kouzoukas to Trump to make the company look worse. I view this as an obvious F.U.D. by the shorts and their pawns in the media.

On Friday night, Fidelity showed less than 1 million shortable shares available with 'hard to obtain' status. Whispers reported over 3 million short shares available. Saturday morning, [Fintel.io](https://fintel.io/ss/us/clov) shows 4.4 million short shares available. This signals to me that only a relatively small number of the short sellers (the smart ones) are closing their positions, which is driving up the price of the stock.

edit: fixed the fintel link. Fidelity and Whispers both require membership to access the data, but Fintel shows the most recent data for free (turn off ad block).

**EDIT: I literally got banned because ""SPAC"" so I guess discussing Clover is no longer allowed on this sub.**"
2021-04-17 05:56:26,wallstreetbets,"Doesn‚Äôt the fact that they are under DOJ investigation concern you? Or that this spurred a class action lawsuit? From a news article:

‚ÄúAs detailed in the complaint, on February 4, 2021, Hindenburg Research published a research report that revealed that Clover's flagship platform, Clover Assistant, was the subject of a U.S. Department of Justice (""DOJ"") investigation for a variety of issues, including illegal kickbacks, marketing practices, and undisclosed related-party transactions. Hindenburg discovered that Clover's sales growth was not driven by technology, but by deceptive sales practices. Following this news, Clover common stock fell $1.72 per share, or over 12% in value, to close on February 4, 2021 at $12.23 per share.

The following day, Clover filed a Form 8-K disclosing that the SEC was conducting an ""investigation and requesting document and data preservation for the period from January 1, 2020, to the present, relating to certain matters that are referenced in the [Hindenburg Research report].""‚Äù

This is not a case of ‚ÄúI like the stock‚Äù"

2021-04-17 16:29:03,wallstreetbets,"The obvious deceit and manipulation going on here is basic, and no different than what we saw with GME. The same tactic applies here: BUY AND HOLD! Its that easy"
2021-04-17 10:20:40,wallstreetbets,"Your caption on the second image is mistaken. Although the CEO is incorrectly listed as a class A shareholder, his shares were not in the float. You can see this out by observing that that image says 109.22% of the stock is owned by the top 15 institutions and top 5 insiders. That is obviously impossible. What appears to have happened is they said he owned A shares when he didn't and thus counted more shares as held than existed.  


So when you fix the mistake by changing his class A position to 0, that should just change the ownership number, not the total float. So his 57.51% should be changed to 0% and the total held by top15 institutions + 5 insiders should be correspondingly adjusted to 51.71% (from 109.22%) to fix the mistake.   


The total number of class A shares in circulation should not have been reduced. By reducing both the number of shares owned by him AND the number of shares that exist, it created a misleading impression of both the % held and the % short.  


PS - I'm not sure how to reconstruct your first image as it doesn't seem to match the 10k data"

If you add those 2 up you can see that it magically adds up to 30.5m shares. Which u have double counted. Also i believe Ian has sold most his holdings.. As per the factsheet he owns mere 5m shares.. So you are being played here into thinking that it will short squeeze. Also that B shares can be converted into A shares so think about dilution it will do when that happens. I bet they will sell ince the price hits 10..

2021-04-17 13:27:29,wallstreetbets,That volume was the shorts. They were doing massive buy and sell orders around the same amount to keep the stock from moving up. Then they were doing large orders to get everyone hyped and then drop the shares to hit stop loss limits and fear.
2021-04-17 11:18:41,wallstreetbets,My question as well. For that volume the price action didn‚Äôt match up. Shorts exiting?
2021-04-17 14:33:58,wallstreetbets,I traded shares on Friday... And It was a wild ride. Fridays trading was under SSR. Monday I think shorts come out swinging hard... Then we see a dip and they try to cover. If you can time the dip. That is the time to buy shares or options and leaves shorts fighting over remaining shares to cover.
2021-04-17 13:14:13,wallstreetbets,Keep an eye on the warrants also
2021-04-17 14:52:31,wallstreetbets,"It seems like a good time to buy shares and sell covered calls, although there's obviously some risk there if the price skyrockets."
2021-04-17 14:43:51,wallstreetbets,"Yep and the best way to get a squeeze going is ATM calls or shares. I picked up shares in mid-$8 yesterday and when I saw the heavy resistance at $9 I paper handed and bailed. I knew the shorts were attacking hard and the chance of a run was going to be slim. 

HF are watching this sub hard. Once tickers show up here, the chances of these things mooning is declining because so much market control is in so few hands."

I think a lot of people swing trade stocks that are skyrocketing and then start to tumble. I don't think the short volume means that bears doubled down necessarily.

Edit: I also accounted for 15k of the long volume on the way up, so I wasn't doing anything other than contributing to the momentum both ways."

It‚Äôs been hit or miss for me. Down overall on contracts but those SPY calls for 4/21 made me bank. It starts to make sense really fast once you try it out.

Buttttt don‚Äôt take my advice. I didn‚Äôt want to miss any boats so I jumped in without a life jacket. Not the greatest strategy."

Calls are easiest. Just remember they are sold for 100 options at a time, so don‚Äôt be surprised when they tally it up when you hit buy.  

Make sure you understand your brokerage policy on expiration and exercising. Some might cash them in at last minute if your ITM but account balance can‚Äôt afford purchasing the stock.  My only experience is them buying them and pushing my balance to uncomfortable levels before I can offload some."

2021-04-17 08:33:10,wallstreetbets,"The short volume was something between 90 and 150 million, depending on where you look. So there was a massive sellforce at the tops."

Whats even more fucky is Hindenburgs panic tweets yesterday (seems weird considering they ""didnt have a position"") - Wonder who they are trying to protect?"
2021-04-17 10:19:19,wallstreetbets,Bloomberg short interest is notoriously incorrect. This DD is accurate. Especially the calculation that subtracts restricted/lockedup shares
2021-04-17 07:24:08,wallstreetbets,"google says 30 million shares shorted,???"
2021-04-17 12:37:15,wallstreetbets,"yeah why not, they're cheap!"
2021-04-17 08:13:51,wallstreetbets,"My theory: 
 
1. Those insiders saw their shares go from 17 dollar to 6 dollar. The 60 million shares alone were therefore worth 660 million less than before.

2. Now they publish this 150 % short interest data on Thursday evening and the people are fomoing in on Friday and the stock is rising.

3. The short volume yesterday was huge (89 million up, ca. 100√ó compared to other dates).
There were never enough shares to borrow to get to this amount. There were therefore probably a lot of naked shorts.
These were probably sold short between 9 and 10 dollar. This would explain why the stock only rose 20 %.

I think the shortsellers are the insiders themselves and they want to secure their investment before it declines further. 
The data was published so they could sell for more than 6,7 dollars a share.
Now they can either buy back, when the stock is declining or they wait until they are no longer restricted to sell their long position.

This would indeed make the si much higher, even if the data of Thursday would be corrected.
But I am not sure if they would be margin called if their long and short positions are balancing each other.

What do you think?"
2021-04-17 10:53:05,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, this clov play is fucking retarded. Since when are shares owned by X not included in float numbers? You could do that with a lot of stocks to make the short interest look much higher."

2021-04-17 06:06:36,wallstreetbets,"The DoJ investigation was the start (and will be the end of shorts). That‚Äôs what enabled the shorts to pummel the stock, pile into this trade and short it to 120% of the float.

2021-04-17 13:55:13,wallstreetbets,Yea the updated number is correct but the important thing is that the public float is still insanely small. insiders own most of it and those shares are locked up until july 5th. the effective SI rate is 148 but the actual rate is around 40. The effective rate is all that matters
2021-04-17 13:50:34,wallstreetbets,Post the link and even if they did; they now include CEOs shares. Those shares don‚Äôt vest until $30 a share... so... they‚Äôre not even out of escrow. They can‚Äôt be traded. So SI is still over 100% of ‚ÄúFREE‚Äù float

>But the bottom line as this DD points out is the bulk of the shares are insiders 

The bulk of the shares are insiders that is correct. **Almost all insider shares are Class B**. These class B shares were never considered as part of the float. Together, there are 406,311,533 shares outstanding, 260,969,355 of which are Class B shares. Of the 145,342,178 class A shares left, around 40M shares are locked up. The rest are free to trade. FactSet and Bloomberg claim that the free, tradable, Class A float number is \~109M. 38M shares short / 109M float = \~35% SI as a percent of the float. Everyone who is doing ""DD"" on this subject are incorrectly subtracting institutionally owned, tradable, Class A shares from the Float saying that they shouldn't be apart of the float when they should because they can be sold at any time."

> a fucking shit ton of those class A shares as insiders.

According to FactSet\[[https://imgur.com/gallery/HocOE0G](https://imgur.com/gallery/HocOE0G)\],  Insiders own 35,500,000 shares of Class A stock. **These are the locked up Class A shares. (**Total Class A shares outstanding:  145,342,178 -  35,500,000 Locked up shares)/ 145,342,178 = .76 or 76% of all Class A shares outstanding are apart of the free tradable float. 

What the DD in this post does incorrectly is subtract Chamath's shares **and** shares from SCH Sponser III **and** shares from Cha Cha Cha SPAC C. Chamath's 30M shares and the shares owned by the two aforementioned entities **are the same shares just represented differently.** Under the table in the 10k which OP pulled the ownership data from there is a subscript explaining how Chamath's 30,500,000 Class A shares were calculated:

>Consists of (i) 20,500,000 shares of Class¬†A common stock held by SCH Sponsor III LLC, (ii) 10,000,000 shares of Class¬†A common stock held by ChaChaCha SPAC C LLC, and (iii) 284,891 shares of Class¬†B common stock held by The Social + Capital Partnership III, L.P. for itself and as nominee for The Social + Capital Partnership Principals Fund III, L.P. (‚ÄúSocial Capital Partnership III‚Äù). Mr.¬†Palihapitiya may be deemed to beneficially own the shares held by Social Capital Partnership III by virtue of his shared voting and investment control over Social Capital Partnership III. The address of Mr.¬†Palihapitiya and each of these entities is 317 University Ave, Suite 200, Palo Alto, CA 94301.

This shows that Chamath doesn't own 30M Class A shares **on top of** those owned by Social Capital and ChaChaCha yet OP subtracts them from the float. Same goes with the shares owned by Osborne. In total, 35.5M Class A shares are locked up, the rest (109M) are freely tradable."

FYI Rolls-Royce doesn't hold the same level of prestige in the aviation world like they do in the automotive world. More aircraft have engines by GE, Engine Alliance and Pratt and Whitney. RR has a small percentage of the wide body market. RR has the least reliable engines out of the three jet engine manufacturers."

And as we all know, Pluto was the god of the underworld so expect downside for the rest of the month. Mercury is in Pisces so fish prices should remain relatively stable, but Pluto is in Capricorn so if you are a goat herder, prepare to hedge. Both Venus and Mercury have formed sextiles, this will bring instability to contracts between businesses. The rest of the month could get bad according to my astrological analysis so please be careful out there retards."

I‚Äôm not sure it will play out as a crash and bailout a la 2008, mostly due to the political climate of 2021 amid the current president. It seems to me that he has built a platform on killing the wage gap, supporting minorities and generally supporting the average American (see insistence on latest infrastructure and direct payments.). If we had another environment where the hedge funds got bailed out of debt while the average American starved it would be no less that a catastrophe for the current political system, which needs to maintain credibility at least for the next year and a half or so. Just some more research to add on. I do believe a crash would otherwise be right around the corner."

The rejection set us back a quarter of a century, as it only now seems to be creeping towards this zone now. Either way, in 5-10 years we will have some insane shit go down.

2021-04-17 07:42:34,wallstreetbets,"Ironically that's the reason the inflation isn't as high as it should be.  It's an open secret to combat inflation during a stimulus/bailout, is to concentrate the money to the wealthy, as they keep the money in their banks/stocks, while the masses use them to buy goods, which increases the cost and demand while decreasing the supply.  AKA this is how inflation goes nuts.  Inflation is mostly based on costs of goods, not just how much people have in assets/liquidity.  This is the reason the stock market is so stupid high.  Majority of the money used during the bail outs/stimulus went to the market makers.  High stock market = lower value of the dollar."

Why set alerts and why stay tuned into financial news? Because you can't trust stop losses. 90% of the time they will work, but that's definitely not a guarantee during a flash crash. Meanwhile, your phone is always on you so an alert can get your attention.









Honestly alerts are a godsend for me because I'm fairly busy and don't have time to constantly check prices. I use the alerts for just about everything I'm invested in. Doing a swing trade? Set alerts, what if I go to the bathroom and it jumps up 15%? I've got my alert. Medium-term rumor investment? Set alerts. Long-term ""I plan on holding this position for 20 years"" - set a fucking alert. This is what saved me so much money during the covid sell off, and not only did it SAVE my money, it MADE me money because I was able to reenter these positions for WAY cheaper than I ever could have imagined.

This thing was stopped dead in its tracks on Jan 28, when RobinHood (and others) shut off the ability to buy more shares. This was done as it was steadily climbing the days prior. If you don‚Äôt think for one second that there weren‚Äôt a number of deals with the devil made in that time that GameStop was shut off by RobinHood and the like then I think your too naive to see through the bullshit. What if the clearing house issues didn‚Äôt shut off the brokers on the 28th? Where was this stock going? I think to the thousands, and I think that‚Äôs where it will go again when everything is said and done. 

Since then, that infamous 1/28/2020 date, the stock has been shorted again and again and again. Almost like the shorts were given a get out of jail free card and expected that lightening couldn‚Äôt possibly strike twice. They continue to short the stock, through dark pools there are thousands of shares borrowed daily until there are none left to borrow for the day. Additionally, ETFs containing GME have incredible short interest in them now. Gamma squeezes have caught the eyes of whales as well - leading to quick surges on weeks where OTM calls seem within reach.

Think about why this stock and company are still being talked about on a daily basis nearly 3 months after the supposed ‚Äúshort squeeze‚Äù took place. Look at the articles, read them. Listen to the talking heads on the news stations, watch the shows. Notice the amount of media coverage this gets when GME prints down but very little when it prints up. It‚Äôs manipulation at its finest. 

Diamond hands started this and diamond hands will see it through. 

This isn‚Äôt FUD, this isn‚Äôt confirmation bias, this is my opinion. That‚Äôs it. You don‚Äôt have to read it and you certainly don‚Äôt have to believe it - I don‚Äôt give a shit either way. 

30 shares at $178 cost average. My position is tiny. It would be cool to see this double or triple. It won‚Äôt matter one bit if it goes to $0, to me at least. But this thing is not fucking over. Nooooo way. In fact, I think it‚Äôs only just begun.

Remember too that back in January the transitions that GME is now taking with new board, finally getting more consoles (which was the thesis for the bullish outlook to begin with), free publicity for 4+ months, new SEC/DTCC laws, etc were not even on the table. They are now.

Have fun, it‚Äôs certainly entertaining.

To the original point of the thread and GME being the catalyst to the downtrend in the overall markets... clearing houses are going to have to pick up the tabs of the brokerages that get wiped out due to GME shorting. The clearing houses will sell long positions probably just about everywhere to cover these tabs. With the amount of short sighted ‚Äúcovid‚Äù investors currently saturating the market, I think at the first 1500 to 2000 point dip we see on the DOW, the covid investors will start to pull there funds in panic. Rinse and repeat until we are back to where we started. DOW 18k."

2021-04-17 19:57:58,wallstreetbets,"Diversify. I know, I know, this is wsb and we like to buy positions for only one company, and not stocks but end of the week options. But in reality, you should own STOCK in companies from most sectors. Within each sector, you should own several companies. Grab some that are leaders in the industry, grab some that give decent, consistent dividends, and then buy some that are up and coming (do proper research obviously, just those factors alone are not enough to buy the stock)











Diversifying splits your investments for a nice solid growth year to year. Will you become a millionaire? Fuck no, but by doing this it helps you maintain positive direction. It makes your money work for you, better than sitting in a bank, and it protects you from a sector crash blowing up your portfolio. Tech stocks crash, only a certain percent of your portfolio is affected, and not only that when one industry has a crash, the money usually is going elsewhere, so you could be neutralizing your losses, or possibly even outpace them.




This obviously doesn't work if there's a marketwide crash. Which is why you should always have an app on your phone that has alerts set so you can be warned when there's movement. Phone alerts saved me from incurring massive losses during the covid crash












>But we're here to YOLO






That's what 5-10% of your portfolio can be. 10% is still way too much in my opinion, but if you want to gamble losing 10% is better than going flat broke. But yea, leave yourself some cash to day trade with, so you can still YOLO with the boys when you'd like"
2021-04-17 17:33:41,wallstreetbets,"Yeah that my problem. I want to retire in 15 years and I have noticed that after the market high in 1926, it didn't recover to that number for thirty years almost. Very scary. I don't know if I could work for 30 more years. I certainly don't want to. Lol."

2021-04-17 18:10:18,wallstreetbets,I mean at least 25% or something cash is my goal. Hate to part with some losers before they flip though.
2021-04-17 18:06:32,wallstreetbets,"I think conventional wisdom says not to try to time the market, but be ready to act accordingly once it is moving a lot. Like stop loss orders on the way down and having money ready to buy up more stocks when it‚Äôs near or at the bottom.

2021-04-17 19:34:25,wallstreetbets,"no, GME will singlehandedly cause the crash when all the shorts get margin called and have to liquidate all their other holdings.  


Edit: just to be clear, what I meant was that GME mooning will cause a crash, not that it will be responsible for the crash.  Shitadel and Co. will be responsible, but the reason for the crash will be the moonshot from GME.  This is because when margin comes calling, all their other holdings will be liquidated and we will see Archagos multiplied by a very large factor."

2021-04-17 15:21:51,wallstreetbets,"I can‚Äôt figure out after reading it again whether they think it will stall at $450 permanently or that will be the begining of the moon.

They do mention it going up slowly during a margin call but I definitely disagree with that. I feel like anyone that has been involved with GameStop stock since at least January has seen how fast the price can rock it up. I personally have seen it go up $150 within the span of an hour or two. This was without a margin call, I don‚Äôt see how in the world that hedge funds can be forced to cover and it be anything other than an immediate and violent climb stopped only by trading halts."

$STLD gave [guidance](https://www.streetinsider.com/Corporate+News/Steel+Dynamics+%28STLD%29+Offers+Q1+Guidance/18143002.html) on March 17 of $1.88 to $1.92 per share.

They included future quarters in their guidance as their long term contracts are still hurting their margins short term. The guidance for the year of $3.5B EBITDA has them earning 40% of their current 8.98B market cap this year.

$NUE gave [guidance](https://www.streetinsider.com/Corporate+News/Nucor+%28NUE%29+Q1+EPS+Guidance+Tops+Consensus/18133252.html) on March 16 of $3.00 to $3.10 per share to be their highest earning quarter on record.

2021-04-17 14:33:47,wallstreetbets,"That was back when Bob Swan was at the helm. Dude was a literal accounting suit and corporate goon who crawled his way up to the top with corporate politics. So at the the top he just kept doing corporate goon shit like pushing out manipulated test results, running advertising campaigns about how the intel 10nm is better than the 7nm of others, suggesting share buybacks, looking to M&A, and other corporate goon shit rather than fixing the real problem which was Intel losing the lead on tech and catching up on 7nm/5nm/3nm chip development/production.

That might not be the case as much anymore now that Gelsinger is back at the helm. Intel is big and might take a while to turn ship so if I had to be I would bet they disappoint yet again, but don't expect another dip down to $45 now that Gelsinger has replaced Swan."

2021-04-17 19:25:05,wallstreetbets,"No, it's retarded not because of the stock valuation but because buying SHARES is actually a safer bet at this point.

At the time of acquisition by Cisco, he opted to take $1.5 millions of Cisco stocks (instead of $1.5M cash).  IRS treated the exercise as taxable income and he paid income taxes on full $1.5 millions.

Shortly after, dot-com bubbled and Cisco stocks dropped to 10% of the previous value.  His $1.5M stocks turned into $150K.

2021-04-17 18:54:55,wallstreetbets,"The way it should work (if his company did it correctly) is he should be taxed as ordinary income at it's fair market value when the options were granted, and then as capital gains on the change in value between then and when he exercised the option. that way he could sell the stock and offset the capital gains with a capital loss. 

Most companies, because they don't know better or because it's more advantageous for them, just tax you once as ordinary income on the appreciated security. that would be unfortunate in this sort of situation."

2021-04-17 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Why to buy Microsoft (MSFT) ASAP! As many know, Discord was in talks with Microsoft to be bought. Since the announcement there's been radio silence. Despite this, Discord was recently in the news again for banning NSFW servers from IOS. This could mean two things; A, Discord is scared of Apple taking notice and being banned from the appstore as a result of the ongoing lawsuit (Apple v Epic Games); B, Microsoft's top dogs are combing through every negative aspect that needs fixing before acquisition. I believe the ladder as Discord is definitely looking to get money ASAP but hasn't announced anything. In my opinion it'd be worth while to buy MSFT. It'd also might be worth while to hold on to the stock a bit longer while Microsoft would move Discord's server hosting to MS Azure hence strengthening their own platform. Take this with a grain of salt though as I'm in high-school and haven't invested in stocks."

[LOSS PRON](https://u.teknik.io/fkVQx.jpg)

The music for todays post is a tryptic. Play in this order.

**Hat in the Wind** \- **Themselves**

**Light Work - Prof**

**All that Glitters - Dead Elvis**

I spent today at work in a sort of elevated and removed state.  The feeling of wanting to puke in every trashcan you walk by mixed with the just-above-ground-floating-weightlessness of an empty portfolio. It was something akin to a cactus whose skin people drink in a jungle I was once in.  Truly my spirit is no longer burdened by excessive wealth. Was it even mine though.. Zen masters believe you reincarnate through every door you walk through, Someone real sensitive said ""May we always just begin to see our selves as something else and smile""

**Some of you, well let me correct myself, many of you will know this feeling.**  The brief apparition of gold that appears in the middle of a trade which does not deter you from continuing some sort of mad ascension, pressing the gas pedal to the floor as you rocket into Valhalla as fast as you smash out. I want to be with you and join your YOLO'd ranks. I know these 5 digits are nothing compared to the magnanimous losses that sit on red thrones much larger than mine but its all relative right.  Life is too short to be a bitch and chicks dig scars.

**The specific details are a blur.**  GOEV is a fast bitch.  She's got a lot to offer just not now.  What tony has in his hat will take probably months to percolate... Shorts are in control and will be now that retail has been absolutely beaten up.  They will probably bail in some shape or form one of the first chances they get.  **There will always be a core group of supporters which I am one of. I really believe in the tech.  I believe that they have the power to disrupt transportation like the Model T did.**

News will be released soon and I would say that its going to be on a scale of -10 which is Lawsuits have traction to 10 which is Apple Car.  Factory and manufacturing partner with some pre-orders is probably a 5-7 depending... You're going to need an 8+ to kick off a naughty squeeze... Or someone will have to take on the unified shorts in the sector. The big move will be convincing institutions to buy in and catch the paper hands of the bailing retail.  Canoo must have a better ground game.  This will either be Cloughvis (God damnit I cant even use your ticker you absolute piece of shit stock because your market cap is too weak for WSB)or CLOV, Canoo gets to pick.  (Watch news drop tomorrow lulz).  Most good stock value plays are pain trains until they are not.

**Personally I need to learn to take gains**, be a bit less believing in my own confirmation bias bullshit.  I need to add a few months if not more to most options plays.  I also need to dark side a bit more and also run spreads. I also have to realize. Shorts are fucking violent and can bring pain.  They don't give up easy and fight on multiple fronts.

**Anyways I would like to thank all of you who joined me on this descent** into a sort of infatuated madness that could only be described as the autistic form of dementia that Lewis Carrol suffered from.  The following is a list of names and by no means is exhaustive but its the ones I can find right now.  I will continue to add as I re-read all the kind messages people have sent.  It has been a strange and crazy trip friends.

I do want to leave this, let me dismount my one trick pony and talk about the past and the future.

**I've spent a lot of time in the past getting into fist fights with death** (and only sometimes winning) and I realized that money doesn't mean a lot.  There's a certain level of financial stability which gets you to a point where you have everything on auto-pay and that works as long as you don't piss off your boss or still like your job. But its really just another stress in life. Enough money will buy you a seat next to the window at the SNF or all the experiences in life you can want.  But that yellow stretcher doesn't give a fuck where it finds you...  It will be there for you one day just the same. Please don't fucking waste your time its all you have. My **Hurt Circus** people will know what I'm talking about all lights, sirens boots on and beard on fire.

But fuck it, I want to be rich.

**The future,** at least as it pertains to this particular writing project of mine will be a rags to riches project.  We'll see if I have what it takes.  I'm open to suggestions of tickers or if you want me to write on something particular send it over and I'll give it a look. I encourage you to upload your own GOEV loss porn in the comments. But also if you won. Maybe show that off to...

But in the meantime I'll see you there.

Be well.

2021-04-17 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Important: the $clov short interest doesn't seem to be around 150% as the news tell us. Around 400 million shares exist of clov. There are class a and class b shares.
Only 145 million shares are outstanding.
The other shares are locked.
The float is something between 110 million (yahoo) and 144 million (bloomberg).
What happened?
To calculate the short interest they reduced the float by the 83 million owned by the CEO.
This leads to a new float of 26 million.
This is the float the media is referencing.
Only the CEO shares are already included in the 255 million shares, that are locked.
The real float still is between 110 and 144 million.
So with 39 million shares shortet, the short interest is really between 27 and 36 %.

The volume today was 244 million and the short volume 89 million (fintel)
This would also be very hard to reach with a float of 26 million.

I think this is huge. People bought because of this data or closed their short positions.

Please excuse my bad English, I'm not a native speaker.
I am also absolutely no market expert, so if anything doesn't add up, feel free to correct me."

2021-04-16 23:30:03,wallstreetbets,Bro what you‚Äôre saying is out right a lie. Free float is 26m it would be 110m if you counted the CEO‚Äôs shares with that amount but it‚Äôs locked and is not a part of the free float. Furthermore it is not uncommon that with such volumes on a short squeeze/momentum/gamma play. Remember GME?
2021-04-17 14:57:47,wallstreetbets,Thank you so much for my first award kind stranger. I was literally very anxious while posting this cause I feared for some hate ‚ù§
2021-04-16 23:30:50,wallstreetbets,"Yes OP you are correct. Short interest isn‚Äôt 144% because FactSet screwed up the float calculation.

2021-04-17 08:46:29,wallstreetbets,Have you noticed in the media how so many stocks are about to short squeeze like GME? All bullshit to distract from GME. I have read a few articles this week that stocks like hyln or disc or some other share u never heard of r going to short squeeze. Fuck that. Buy GME and hold

2021-04-16 23:35:14,wallstreetbets,Nope. The 110 million number doesn‚Äôt include the CEO‚Äôs locked up Class B shares either. FactSet initially thought it did and subtracted the 83 mil from it but are now going to correct that number. Also GME is a black swan event. GME had very unusually high short %.

2021-04-17 00:04:08,wallstreetbets,"1. The original float number already excluded the Class B shares. That is what many people are misunderstanding. FactSet mistakenly subtracted the 83M CEO Class B shares from a float number that NEVER included them.
2. Also Vanguard owns 26,185,529 Class A shares (Also per FactSet) yet the float  is 26.3M (According to FactSet's miscalculation). Are you telling me that there are only 115k shares of tradable shares not including Vanguard?? Also as of Dec 31st 2020, institutional investors own 39,657,150 Class A tradable shares so that already exceeds the miscalculated tradable float...

FactSet is currently fixing the miscalculation."

[Not mistakenly, read the 8k to see that his 80m shares come with a variety of restrictions - the only non-performance based block I could spot is 16m RSU that vests 20% each year for 5 years starting 1/7/2022] (https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1801170/000119312521007348/d63659d8k.htm)"
2021-04-17 01:19:08,wallstreetbets,"My interpretation: 
They published the si data on April 15th in the evening.
Short volume on the 16th was around 100 million after that info.
So the price was pushed because of fomoing while a huge amount of shares were shortselled at high prices.
There were never enough shares to borrow for this volume, so this could have been naked shorts.
Someone used this situation to sell on top and get a huge amount of liquidity.

When they correct their data, many people will want to get out again, even though the short interest is now high because of the possible naked shorting that won't be in the corrected data, and then the shorts can buy back for much less.
And no one would ever know because they will have bought the shares back long before they have to prove the ownership."
2021-04-17 00:23:49,wallstreetbets,Those shares were never a part of the float to begin with. Also if they were explain how Vanguard got their hands on 99% of the tradable float?
2021-04-17 00:34:44,wallstreetbets,"idk, im just pointing out that class b shares being excluded doesn't pass a basic 8k check - maybe they fat fingered it? but to include the ceo's 80million shares in any free float is regarded and wrong."
2021-04-17 01:08:12,wallstreetbets,Yea I agree that the CEO's 80M shares shouldn't be included in the float. But they never were included.

2021-04-16 23:56:37,wallstreetbets,"So yes, I'm invested in Rycey/RR with expectation of staying in 2 years minimum.

But you have to understand that the the Rycey ticker symbol does not reflect reality. It's neither accounting for a past split of RR nor the dilution that happened in 2020. Long term you're looking at a 100% gain by 2023 if things go well for the company. If it rebounded to pre-covid levels it MIGHT get near $3 off hype. An ATH would be like $3.50.

There's an entire subreddit devoted to this and no one ever thinks to compare RR and Rycey and wonder why the ratios are way off, yet they are the same stock share for share.

Do your research."

EDIT: u/nafemp read his comment below and not mine. I gave that a half ass approach last night. I figured I‚Äôd at least try and give some kind of correction, when I should have dug deeper prior. You are right - no split, dilution through share offering. I think warrants came into play as well?"
2021-04-17 02:51:30,wallstreetbets,I used to work there.  Personally I don't think the company is agile enough to keep up when technology moves on.  My gut is that they will keep on ticking along as they are.  I think you're right about them getting taxpayer support if they need it.

If militaries are clocking hours, RYCEY is making bank.  If not, then no $.  They are also trying to come up with an all-electric jet engine, I guess to capitalize on EV.  RYCEY is a 2-5 year play.

Yes that's absolutely true. Just go look at any continuously reverse split micro penny stock with 'prior prices' in the millions(They never were actually priced that high they just consistently reverse split and then dilute shares and keep drilling) or just look at TSLA.

RR is also different than RYCEY."

2021-04-17 00:27:16,wallstreetbets,"The ADR ratio between Rycey and RR is 1:1, so how do you think they are fundamentally different other than pound dollar/conversion, liquidity, and different market timing?"
2021-04-16 22:55:23,wallstreetbets,"What he is saying, is that rycey is the aeronautic division of Rolls-Royce, not the cars. RYCEY makes jet engines"
2021-04-17 00:37:56,wallstreetbets,"Not really the two still have completely different mkt caps even after considering dollar/pound conversion. 

RYCEY also crashed from 11 loooong before RR did it's split and didn't follow RR's price action at all post split. Nor did it enjoy the same recovery that RR did recently. Same company(Not arguing that) but the ADR definitely trades completely differently. The ADR shouldn't in theory be affected by a split in the LSE traded stock anyways because splits don't effect market cap, therefore a theoretical coinciding drop in RYCEY would be reflected by a woefully smaller market cap for no reason which just doesn't fundamentally make any sense. RYCEY should theoretically be unchanged by a stock split in RR because the company value has remained unchanged and RYCEY doesn't require a different price to reflect the same relative value.

RYCEY's problems lay more in bad share dilution(Trying to find my source on that) but hasn't itself had a split since 2015.

EDIT: This also doesn't refute my point that stocks don't record a sudden dip every time a company does a split or vice versa for a reverse split. That's not why RYCEY nosedived from 11 at all(Even though it's still silly to assume it could hit 11 again anytime soon) and that's not how splits get reflected in charts."
2021-04-17 01:03:30,wallstreetbets,"A better TL;DR more to the point way to put it; 

RR post split is still worth the same mkt cap as a split doesn't effect that on it's own, therefore a split in RR would not effect the price per share of RYCEY or it's potential price ceiling because RYCEY's price would remain unchanged to reflect the ADR's same relative mkt cap.

RR's October split has no bearing on RYCEY's potential upside, nor was it responsible for the downswing(Splits generally bring investors in and are seen as bullish anyways), and it absolutely wouldn't be recorded in RYCEY as a drop."

2021-04-17 01:13:12,wallstreetbets,No that's my opinion as to why RYCEY can't see 11 again in the near future despite the price drop not being a reflection of the split and why a hope for a fast recovery bump to 11 is just not likely at all.(Although who the fuck knows really in a post GME world). Same reason why it's unlikely that CCL and a lot of other recovery stocks that issued shares during the pandemic can't see their pre pandemic prices again in the near future. The original commenter was still right about that it just wasn't because of a split.

2021-04-17 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"why you should be rock hard for $DIS, from a nerd Alrighty retards, I've been here since late January and I am amazed at how little chatter there is about Disney right now.  There's 3 key things that make me super bullish about it, and I'm gonna try to break them down without any of that technical jargon that you need to be actually smart to understand. Disney+, Disney Parks, and their merchandise.

So! let's start with the easiest one to dive into:

# THE THEME PARKS: 

 In 2019, Disney parks generated 6.7 BILLIONS in income, a little over 40% of their entire revenue.  With the pandemic, park attendance obviously plummeted, and several closed.  At the time of writing this, only 3 of the 6 parks globally are open, with one (Disney California) set to re open by the end of the month with reduced capacity (around 25% of the max).  With Biden's plan to have everyone able to be vaccinated soon, that capacity is going to back up to max, and as the entire world recovers the other parks go back to normal too.  with every park going back up, there's gonna be a massive bump in income.  That's before you consider that most everyone has been locked up for over a year now, and I am willing to bet my left nut that somewhere some little timmy and billy have been begging their middle class mommy and daddy to go to Disney.  I wouldn't be surprised if we see record attendance numbers for these parks this year.   


But wait, there's more! There is an Avengers themed area set to open in June this year, and Galaxy's Edge, the Star Wars themed section of the American Parks, opened May 31, 2019  to  rave reviews!  Given the new Star Wars content being announced and published, attractions like these are going to continue to expand and draw people with new experiences.  You can build your own lightsaber there, for $200! and that ties into...  


# THE MERCHANDISE:

Disney sells a LOT of shit.  I mean, a fucking lot.  Star Wars alone has entire series of novels, comic books, video games, apparel, and even a convention (Star Wars Celebration) .  And since the Sequel trilogy has ended, Disney has moved Star Wars into a new era: The High Republic.  Primarily as books and comics, this era is 200 years before the mainline series.  They have CENTURIES of timeline to play with, and without the restraints of existing material to confine them.  The Clone Wars is only a roughly 3 year period in the lore, and the amount of shit that happens in that period is insane.  Disney is going to milk this period for as much as they can, with some speculation they may bring in some fan favorite characters from Star Wars Legends (canon before Disney bought the rights and erased 90% of the timeline), namely Darth Revan.  I won't get into it too much, but Revan alone is a huge draw for Star Wars Fanatics.  Marvel is also killing it with comic books and collectibles, but my knowledge is admittedly less in depth on the MCU stuff, merch wise.  The universe, though?

&#x200B;

# DISNEY+:

Disney+ is an absolute gold mine that Disney is sitting on.  They have exclusive access to two of the biggest IP's, period, with Star Wars and the MCU, and both are built on movies and tv shows.  With how the Netflix MCU shows have had the rights revoked, the onslaught of new shows (Wandavision, Falcon and the Winter Soldier, Clone Wars season 7, Bad Batch, The Mandalorian, Book of Boba Fett, Kenobi...) Disney is setting itself up to keep those subscriber numbers up by slow feeding the horde of fans with content.  Add in how they've been doing movie releases on the platform with Mulan, where you paid an additional $30 to access the brand new movie, and how that model has also been confirmed for the upcoming Black Widow and Cruella films, and it's a safe assumption that Disney is gearing the platform up to be a theatre alternative.  why go buy a movie ticket and drive to theater, deal with a noisy crowd, and not be able to pause the movie when you can just buy it from home and watch it? This is likely going to happen for the entire future of the MCU.  The big ace up the sleeve though, is the Fox library.  Remember that Disney bought out Fox not too long ago? They have nearly all Fox content now on Disney+.  X-men, Avatar (blue aliens, not the cartoon) Night at the Museum, etc are all Disney now.   


In short, Disney is STACKED to make a killing these next few years, but especially this year."

2021-04-17 13:46:33,wallstreetbets,"People asli forget that Disney owns a lot of media content with ESPN, ABC, Hulu, FX, etc.  IMO the streaming bundle they sell with Disney+, ESPN+, and Hulu is a good value.

I think there is a strong bull case for Disney to have big run in the next 6mos to a year.  ITM leaps are pretty expensive though, so I've been selling put credit spreads."
2021-04-17 19:38:15,wallstreetbets,"DIS is the way.  the way i see it, their streaming business will be as large as netflix + merchandizing + parks revenue.  Netflix market cap 242 bn. Dis market cap was about 170bn before they announced entering the streaming business. 170 + 242 = 412 bn.  Current market cap for dis is 339bn.  Doesn't include the growth of their merchandizing and other spinoffs they end up doing.  

position 198 shares, long at average price $122"
2021-04-16 23:20:03,wallstreetbets,"Few counterpoints: I think a lot of what you‚Äôre bullish about has already been priced in. DIS hit their ATH right around peak COVID. If that‚Äôs not a signal of a forward thinking market I don‚Äôt know what is.

Globally, the helium supply is rather limited and these British guys are determined to monopolize the mining and distribution across Africa, with the Tanzanian government fully supporting their agenda.

2021-04-17 07:34:06,wallstreetbets,Exactly. And it‚Äôs fucking over a lot of real estate investors that buy property that‚Äôs off the MLS (which is most REIs) during probably the highest volume of investment properties in the history of the us because interest rates are so low for loans and everyone‚Äôs hedging against hyperinflation. I imagine this company will really only see success in earnings when the market tanks and more millennials/gen z can afford real estate let alone sell it lazily through the app.

He needs more shares to mess around with coveres calls."

2021-04-17 08:55:02,wallstreetbets,Have you looked at the 5 year chart?  Viac was in steady decline precovid.  It ended 2019 at $34.  It ended 2020 at $37.  The run from end of 2020 to Archegos was driven by Archegos.  If you‚Äôre buying because it was $100 share a month ago and you think it‚Äôs going back there you‚Äôre buying on a very bad theory.  No one else is stepping in to buy billions and drive up the price.

Premiums hyper-inflated from it being one of the most crowded trades in the market.

Only noobs looking to lose money are hopping-in

And plenty of call writers with dummy accounts hopping all over wsb telling kids $VIAC is great r/n.

It‚Äôs not.

It‚Äôs utterly fucking retarded.

You want money in OTM leaps? Buy something that no one‚Äôs talking about like $OIH 1/22 250c

$TSP shares are still trading around IPO price of $40.

Here is the story of TuSimple founded in San Diego in 2015 that already has partnerships with UPS, Xpress and McLane. Also did a trial run for USPS last year.

https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/21/self-driving-truck-startup-tusimple-will-haul-mail-for-usps-in-two-week-pilot/

From an article last year:

[https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/01/tusimple-kicks-off-plan-for-a-nationwide-self-driving-truck-network-with-partners-ups-xpress-and-mclane/](https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/01/tusimple-kicks-off-plan-for-a-nationwide-self-driving-truck-network-with-partners-ups-xpress-and-mclane/)

TuSimple already carries freight in its autonomous trucks (always with human safety operators on board) along seven different routes between Phoenix, Tucson, El Paso and Dallas. TuSimple said it will expand its service area with existing customers UPS and McLane. U.S. Xpress is a new partner. Penske will help TuSimple scale its fleet of operations nationwide and provide preventative maintenance for the self-driving trucks, the company said.

TuSimple said the network will be rolled out in three phases, starting with a focus on a service area in the Southwest where it already operates. Phase 1, which will launch in 2020 and into 2021, will cover service between Phoenix, Tucson, El Paso, Dallas, Houston and San Antonio.

This fall, TuSimple plans to open a new shipping terminal in Dallas. TuSimple said these terminals are designed to be shared by mid-sized customers. TuSimple will carry freight directly to a company‚Äôs distribution center if it is a high-volume customer.

The second phase will begin in 2022 and expand service from Los Angeles to Jacksonville and connect the East Coast with the West, the company said.

The final phase will expand across the lower 48 states, beginning in 2023. The company said it will replicate the strategy in Europe and Asia after the AFN rolls out nationwide.

Seems like a good follow through until Oct

TuSimple, has amassed a workforce of about 800 and raised hundreds of millions of dollars from investors. The company posted revenue of $1.8 million last year and a net loss of $177.9 million, according to the filing, reflecting how it is still in the early stages of developing commercial technology.

TuSimple has so far earned money as a traditional freight-hauler, not from selling its self-driving technology ready in 2024. It has customer reservations for more than 5,700 trucks, although those aren‚Äôt equivalent to sales revenue.

When you bet on a comp this early, you need to look at the space and team.

Autonomous trucking space is red hot. Trucking by far happens on the interstate highways which are easiest to automate for Level 4 and 5.

Trucking by far is very lucrative to automate. Cost of goods carried. No long stops, more safety, machines are less susceptible to fatigue. The merits of automating trucking need another reddit post all by itself. 

Now let's look at the team:

Well, it does have a connection to ‚ÄòChina‚Äô but the founder seems legit.

TLDR: Real autonomous driving technology startup that seems legit. Potential to be a runner like $NKLA (but with real tech)

Cap is > $1B. Potential 10x. Could deploy tech massively either in the US and/or China. 

Team and tech could also attract a buyout from bigger players

2021-04-16 23:17:28,wallstreetbets,Fuck autonomous vehicles of any and all kinds and fuck you for investing in them
2021-04-17 06:22:11,wallstreetbets,"Consider this: there are about 3.5 otr (over the road) drivers in the us. This group basically lives in their truck for weeks at a time. Many come from rural areas where alternative employment is not available or wages are too low to support a family.

When automation becomes both legal and adopted these jobs will disappear. Then we'll have 3.5 million men (mostly) with nothing to lose. Shits going to get tense and we should consider how that level of unemployment will effect the economy and markets.

I am one of those drivers. Honestly I hate driving a truck and will be glad to be rid of it but I'm not really qualified for anything else. I've talked to other drivers and there is a lot of fear and anger. Some suggest things like rolling protests where trucks drive slow on the interstate and slow everyone down to simply just parking a tractor in the road and abandoning it. Some hint at gun ownership of truck drivers and make vague insinuations.

My point is that 3.5 million men ain't nothing. It will likely cause some volitility, and create some surprise dips and losses. There's also the spectre of big daddy government stepping in on truckers' behalf, but honestly I think that's a longshot. If most truckers were women then definitely they'd get help, but men? Nobody gives a fuck about men who lose.

Also a lot of truckers in Canada and Mexico. They cross the border into the US all the time and operate here legally as part of NAFTA/USMCA agreement. If they get pissed and block ports of entry that could be an opportunity for puts. A lot of auto manufacturers use JIT (just in time) assembly. Instead of warehousing parts the trucks deliver them hours/minutes before they get put on a new vehicle. 

If a truck load of driver seats for Ford Explorers are sitting in traffic at the port of Nogales then that whole line at the Ford Assembly Plant in Louisville, Kentucky gets shut down. 

If the Ichiko plant in Shelbyville, Kentucky can't get the plastic beads for their injection molding machines then they may miss their scheduled deliveries of car mirrors to Toyota plants in surrounding states.

Now imagine Tesla missing a production goal because various components kept getting delayed. They can't put that internal component on later. It has to go on before the doors and windshield. Anyway, it could cause some dips in tsla already volital share price.

Every fucking industry relies on a supply chain of trucks. And we are investing in companies that will disrupt trucking.

Come to think of it Tesla is the most famous company that will disrupt trucking. Expect them to be a focus of driver rage. We know what's in our trucks and where it's going and how badly they need it. Oops, got a flat tire. Had to stop and get new turn signals. I've got the flu. Gonna sit at this truck stop for a few days and recover.

My personal favorite is to log everything I do as on duty. Wait four hours at a shipper and I log all four hours. Pretty soon I run out of hours and I have to shut the truck down for a day playing Playstation until new hours become available.

I won't get paid for that, but no one else does either."

But I would be very careful with the protest actions you are mentioning. Guessing it would be as a last resort of sorts, but as someone who works for a high volume shipper, if the company got word that their product was late due to a protest of some sort on the part of the shipping carrier, they would never use that shipping carrier again.  On time performance is huge (as I am sure you know), & there are rate agreements in place for backup carriers for every shipping lane that are ready to go. Sure it would lead to some disruption & maybe an increase in costs, but all of that is worth getting the product where it's needed (as you referenced downstream impact).

2021-04-17 13:39:55,wallstreetbets,"No, not entirely. It is also to normalize (/regulate) expectations of work hours, which is not just about fatigue, but ultimately standardizes scheduling (& in a sense rates) in the industry.

That's not to say that automated trucking & adjusted regulations won't effectively prompt an evolution/change in those areas, but more pointing out that it is not solely about driver fatigue.


Also, I would be less concerned about automated trucking on the highways (apart from endangering other humans) than I would be at a container yard or distribution center. That often requires maneuvering in tight areas going both forward & reverse & has the potential to cause damage fairly quickly.


Lastly, I work for a large retailer/shipper that certainly qualifies as ""high volume"" with agreements for shipping lanes all over the US (& some in Mexico & Canada), and this carrier does not currently have competitive rates (compared to what can be negotiated), or maybe they have such limited capacity that they aren't really considered in current rate bids (it's the time of year for annual rate agreements to be made). Shipping is a lucrative industry, but if they are having to put $ toward current shipping operations + prioritizing investment in this future tech, it could be difficult for them to accept competitive rates in the next few years before the tech is actually in place."

2021-04-17 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"I counted all the GME Yolos Part 3 Hi Everyone,

In case you missed my first posts on my efforts of counting gme yolos they can be found here: [Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mdex64/dd_i_counted_all_the_wallstreetbets_gme_yolos/) [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/me13xm/dd_part_2_i_counted_all_the_wallstreetbets_gme/)

To summarize I am manually recording every instance of people posting their positions.  I have dedupped the data and interestingly the only instances of repeat users has been users increasing their positions. This could be because the type of the user to post their position is fully committed or if they do decrease their position they won't post. Either way pretty interesting. I am making some pretty stupid assumptions that of all the positions I have recorded no one has paper handed. Previously I had recorded 261 yolos holding 339,958 shares.

**Updated Data:** Since then I have recorded an additional 212 positions for a total of **473** positions representing **576,433** shares. With current after hours share prices of $160.81 these shares represent **$92,696,190.73** or for those that can't read big numbers **92.7 million**.

As I had mentioned in my previous posts I personally believe the [rule of 1%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_%28Internet_culture%29) on the internet applies to these yolo positions and for every position posted there are likely 10-100 that are silent. Just for fun if we apply the 1:9:90 ratio for content creator, upvoter  and viewer. We can make a some what irresponsible estimates of  silent whales :

1:9= 4,257 Silent WSB Kongs with 5,187,897 shares.

1:90= 42,570 Silent WSB Kongs with 51,878,970 shares.

Either way retail owns a lot and can make an big impact by holding.

2021-04-17 14:06:06,wallstreetbets,i mean this is a cool idea but it needs some work. you can't just multiply the average 1% position by this ratio. it's a huge assumption that the people willing to share their positions are a random sampling of the whole population. they're not random and in fact some of them may be motivated to post particularly because they hold oversized (or over-average) positions

2021-04-17 13:30:24,wallstreetbets,I'm at 22 at the moment but would like that sweet 25 come next week
2021-04-17 14:02:38,wallstreetbets,I've had that same thought for a while and now even more so. I bet we own the whole damn flotilla.
2021-04-16 20:24:36,wallstreetbets,There are pretty wide ranges about the possible float the most accurate seems to be around 52m shares available. From Bloomberg terminal drops I think institutions own around 142% of float which is crazy.
2021-04-17 05:46:40,wallstreetbets,"20*4* here

Yeah that's right, petty"

2021-04-16 20:22:22,wallstreetbets,This is a fair question but I don't really think there is a way of knowing like anything else there is a good chance at least a % of them are fake but my guess is as good as yours.
2021-04-16 21:25:50,wallstreetbets,Please direct that question to Melvin and Shitadel.
2021-04-16 21:52:45,wallstreetbets,I mean retails power is in numbers. There was a post a while back about etoro confirming they have a little under 2 million users holding gme and that was just one broker. Even if all them only have positions like you shorters are fucked.
2021-04-16 20:57:27,wallstreetbets,Yeah I can't shitpost rn
2021-04-17 16:34:44,wallstreetbets,"Alright so more detailed break out: 1 holding 200k shares the the man the myth the legend. 2 holding 20k-25k shares 5 holding 10k-19.9k shares 9 holding 5k-9.9k shares 69 holding between 1k-4.9k shares 59 holding between 500-999 shares 207 holding between 100-499 shares 121 holding between 1-99 share *Mentioned wsb filters out this range so this number in reality probably would be much larger.

Excluding DFV mean average of shares held is 797."
2021-04-16 20:26:26,wallstreetbets,That is fair but I only started counting really in the last week of march and I think if you had held through the second peak I suspect you have pretty solid diamond hands and are never selling lol
2021-04-16 21:19:08,wallstreetbets,I mean I personally think it is big. Means a little under 500 people own more than 1% of the company float and there are 10 million people on this subreddit. Like I said I personally think for every person who posts a yolo there are probably 10-100 people who hold similar positions and are silent. That doesn't even really consider the hordes of apes who own small amounts which add up also.
2021-04-16 21:10:44,wallstreetbets,So I started counting in the last week of March and went back through all the available yolos which spanned into Jan but this is by no means a total accounting. I am definitely missing a lot and missed a lot but still shows a very small amount of wsb users hold a ton of shares.
2021-04-17 16:31:57,wallstreetbets,"It is def just a estimate and as I call out obviously somewhat irresponsible but if you think about it actually might make sense. So to clarify I am not suggesting my calculations represent every holder but only the largest holders and I actually do think it is pretty fair that for every person who is willing to share a large position there is some ratio that are private I am not positive but I really do not think 1:9 ratio is at all farfetched. Just to demonstrate if you believe there are 500k retail holders the 1% of biggest of holders would equal 5,000 people my calculation is 4,257. If you believe there are 5 million gme retail holders the top 1% largest positions would equal 50k my estimate is 42k. My calculations arn't really considering the other 99% of holders that might have smaller positions. It is def back of napkin estimates but the point is retail holds a lot."
2021-04-17 04:29:21,wallstreetbets,why?
2021-04-16 21:08:41,wallstreetbets,I don't think blackrock and fidelity are out in fact I think they are still two of the largest holders can refer to the guy who posts the daily bloomberg drops and look at holders.
2021-04-17 01:53:42,wallstreetbets,I recommend reading up on how ETFs work.
2021-04-16 20:56:27,wallstreetbets,Damn my 700 didn't make the cut.
2021-04-16 22:59:04,wallstreetbets,I remember reading an old thread with a guy who had $50 million worth of GME forever ago. Might be worth $100 mill now with 400k shares. There are really wealthy people out there don‚Äôt forget that
2021-04-17 12:24:10,wallstreetbets,Myself and a few others hold much more than 25k shares each.
2021-04-17 01:49:19,wallstreetbets,"w00t, in that 86"
2021-04-17 08:58:13,wallstreetbets,There was someone back in January that posted a confirmed 1.4 million share position. Not sure if he's still holding though.

2021-04-17 14:17:55,wallstreetbets,I think a lot of us don‚Äôt want to post our positions until after this is all over.

2021-04-16 21:50:15,wallstreetbets,**This is incorrect**. I can‚Äôt believe people are still repeating this misinformation. Most of the filings that Bloomberg shows are from *12/31/20* that is a lifetime ago for GME. We have no idea what the Institutional ownership of GME is and won‚Äôt know until 5/15/21.

2021-04-16 21:06:38,wallstreetbets,I mean I think the Bloomberg terminal is better than most. Obviously still limited by the filing time frames but best we can get. I saw some dd debunking the morning star 191% Institutional ownership but I think even that guy said he believed the 142% bloomberg terminal number.
2021-04-16 21:54:53,wallstreetbets,I mean they are as good as it currently gets and for the larger holders my understanding is if they change their position more than 5% they have to make additional filings so yeah it probably isn't 142% but it still is a shit ton.
2021-04-16 21:37:25,wallstreetbets,You can privately send me your ss# ...JP I have been using the screenshot method since there isn't really any other way to validate. Someone previously had mentioned lobbying brokers to add an anonymized way to share a link to a position or something like that which couldn't just be mocked up in photoshop. Probably won't  happen but would be cool if it did!
2021-04-17 12:26:09,wallstreetbets,Even if it was just 5 shares each that's another 10 million shares.. damn
2021-04-16 21:20:56,wallstreetbets,No worries. Like all the other data we have it is definitely not accurate or that useful but I do think it should provide a little confidence to those holding gme.

My understanding was ""Any changes to the information contained in a Schedule 13G form must be amended through additional reporting. Institutional investors are required to file an amendment to report any changes within 45 days of the end of the year or within 10 days of first finishing a month above 10% and then within 10 days of any month-end where the holder's ownership increases or decreases by 5% or more."" They are saying they sold their stake in Jan but wouldn't that mean at this point almost 3 months later and 2 months end since the original filing shouldn't there be an updated filing? Not trying to argue but better understand."

2021-04-16 23:21:04,wallstreetbets,Dfv is a king. But can somone explain to me why all the comments are essentially saying goodbye to him? Besides the moon where is he suppose to be going?
2021-04-16 23:26:51,wallstreetbets,This man. He streamed for 2 people. 2 fucking people. I remember trying to stream for 2 people before. It is so hard to do that and the fact that he seemed so grateful for them being there. Man this guy. Such a inspiration to everyone. This video makes me cry just a little bit.
2021-04-16 23:27:25,wallstreetbets,"Whether GME moons or not, this has been one hell of a ride.  No regrets.  I love the stock."

2021-04-17 01:11:03,wallstreetbets,What are the odds that Nicholas and Nick are the same person. There was only one true fan .
2021-04-17 01:46:43,wallstreetbets,It's not even that he picked a cherry of a company. His options contracts/timing was impeccable. Remember some of his January 2021 contracts literally boomed days before expiry.
2021-04-17 01:53:44,wallstreetbets,Watch it guys he took wall street for all its money and now hes coming for your karma badges for his trophy wall. But to be honest as I move into day trading I wish I had someone like him as a mentor pre gme not just for off the cuff financial interpretation but for his cool calm well spoken approach to a normally high stress job role.

Who knows what the future will bring, but one thing we do know is that FINALLY, a good, decent fellow won against the smug, arrogant elite, and never has to worry about finances again.

Best of luck to  you, DFV/Roaring Kitty.  You stayed steady through it all - I hope your future becomes even brighter."

On DVF's YOLO update yesterday, he wrote ""final update."" Was that only the final update from his DFV account/username, but he also has this one to post from going forward?"

The true difficulty lies in holding on for the ride and following your gut because you see the light at the end of the tunnel. 

DFV saw that light, shook the magic eight ball, and re-upped. Legend."

People either display top tier skill and draw in a crowd of people looking for tips from people at the top of the game they‚Äôre playing.

People build a following based on their personality and what they bring to the community. Sodapoppin has an established community that refers to him by name, Chance. This fan base has a personal connection to him and this is what all streamers aspire to. He can disappear for a month then come back playing a random indie game and hit 20k viewers easily. People like him as a person, also as a top tier WoW pvper but he‚Äôs more variety nowadays.

Brute force. Some people like Zizaran stream as much as possible as consistently as possible. Because they‚Äôre always online, they‚Äôre keep viewers and people coming back daily.

Timing. Some people got in to twitch early on when the streamer base wasn‚Äôt saturated. It was much easier to generate a following back then and some of those guys are still going strong today maintaining that following that they never left.

Having said this, if you take a break from steaming for any amount of time, even just a few days, your subs and follower counts will begin to plummet quickly."

He‚Äôs won so big on this one and been put on such a pedestal, there will be people who will go all in with life savings just based on what DFV thinks could happen. All it takes is one psycho to lose everything on a bad bet and they could put him in danger. If I was him, I would stay away from making any content at all that people could misconstrue as investment advice, especially now that he has the following he has. Even when telling friends about gme and it‚Äôs potential, I made it very clear that I am not telling them to invest and that they only should do so after further research on their own and if they find it to be worth it themselves. Money on its own is such a destructive thing and will drive people to crazy things."

Sucks that he's too old at this point but I always thought DFV looked a lot like Chainsaw aka [Dean Cameron](https://i0.wp.com/anatomyoffear.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/chainsawthumbsup.jpg?resize=590%2C348&ssl=1) from Summer School.

2021-04-17 03:29:25,wallstreetbets,"Yes. It‚Äôs quite simple. Before yesterday he owned 100,000 shares. He now owns 200,000. I struggle with how anyone can say he has cashed out, sold out, it‚Äôs all over. The figures speak for themselves, yesterday he doubled his position!!"
2021-04-16 22:50:45,wallstreetbets,You‚Äôre absolutely right. If you just made a movie of the last 12 months.. how fucking crazy. We will all have these stories to tell our grandchildren. It really is pretty wild.

2021-04-16 22:09:16,wallstreetbets,"Well over a year ago actually. He‚Äôd just started his YouTube channel, or at least live-streaming, so yeah no one knew who he was and GME was steady at like 4$ and again no one knew what was coming. Except for this madlad."

2021-04-16 23:40:11,wallstreetbets,"I think people are put off by the first book, not realising the repercussions that would come to further in the sorry arc, and stopped reading it before it gets better because it seems so light hearted, kinda like the first Harry Potter book, or write it off as a *little bit derivative*.. 

..and I couldn‚Äôt blame them for being put off by the fan base, who are toxic and condescending af on social media.

But, on the whole, *even if* it seems like a slow moving hack job full of plot holes, devoid of any nuance in attempting to craft a universe that instills morals like C. S. Lewis‚Äôs *Narnia* , and meanders at times to the point where it‚Äôs y clear what genre it wants to be - romance, horror, action, incest erotica, poetry, sci-fi, and hot takes that the main character would probably get *crucified* for these days - it does have some amusingly righteous content, *and* an important piece of fiction.

Several groups have been compelled to write shitty fanfic sequels to it (full of anachronisms), after all."
2021-04-17 02:03:12,wallstreetbets,"I saw the movie, but they say the book was better. A lot of action, betrayal and oh god is it gory. At the end you feel like they're setting you up for the sequel, but c'mon!       2,020 years is overkill imo."

Jesus told him that he was gonna get hung on a cross and Judas was gonna rat him out for some money, this shocked Judas and he initially refused. But this NEEDED to happen the way Jesus had foretold it. Ask yourself something. if your one of the 12 disciples following Jesus,are you gonna defy the holy father in human form when he tells you to do something? Fuck no.

Myself, I participate in a community where ideas are shared and discussed, and I enjoy discussing the view points of multiple individuals, not just one person.

If you choose a single person to view as a leader, all power to you.  Down that path lies blind allegiance and potential manipulation. Hard pass for me, but you enjoy your cup of koolaid."

You really need to work on your grammar. Care to explain what that word salad of a sentence is supposed to mean?

Are you suggesting that calling you a prick makes me one? Strong argument right there chief.

>Will you also correct me when I‚Äôm balls deep in your bitch mouth?

I can only imagine how small your dick is if you find it so easy to get balls deep in anyone's mouth. Average penis sizes struggle with doing that -- I suppose that must be an advantage of a mircopenis. You can proudly exclaim that you can go ""balls deep"".

Don't let the size of your tiny penis bother you. As long as you know how to work it or are good with your fingers, you should be able to keep someone pleased.

Plus, you don't need to exert that much energy with such a small dick. Only tiny movements required to jerk yourself off. 

Continue winning at life you magnificent crotch goblin you!"

See other ""meme stocks"" and you'll notice covid impacted them harshly (AMC no people no movies no profit for example) they went for the killing blow and banked on gamestop not being able to pay off its debt (they did) and now there's a nightmare setup for them in the works to get out of their positions.

If your companies share price hits 0 its game over and usually over before hand. People lose confidence and thats a wrap. DFV saw what many didn't and although was not in the spotlight originally it eventually picked up steam and now here we are with a company with an extremely loyal fan base and Ryan Cohen at the wheel. Its definitely helped for sure and also should do great things for the market after this gets untangled when it comes to fairness to the common investors like us."
2021-04-16 22:26:41,wallstreetbets,"I believe what happened is that so many people bought the stock that the company was able to sell some that they were holding on to specifically for selling when they wanted to and by selling that stock they were able to pay off a lot of debt and save their business more or less, in fact from what I understand they're off to a very strong start moving forward now"

> If your companies share price hits 0 its game over 

That's only for the shares, not necessarily the actual business (assuming there is one):

> If the stock reaches a value of zero, trading can cease and the company can continue to operate as a privately held company, or the company may file for bankruptcy. A company's stock reaching zero value does not mean that the company must file for bankruptcy. It simply means that the equity value of the company has been wiped out, and if the company wants to raise new equity capital, it must re-issue common shares to new shareholders."

Chamath stands to benefit whichever way this goes. It's just a tad better than Holmes' Theranos or Trevor's Nikola, but not that much better really.

I'd rather not  bet on something that can go either way short/ medium term but is a long term fail - and I have zero special knowledge about short term moves.

The GME case was totally different: you had a sound business being run down by hedge funds for a quick buck. Otherwise a sound business experiencing obvious temporary difficulties due to C19.

That being said, congrats to those who won some and sorry for those who lost some."

That 134% is based only on shares possible to be traded, which isn't wrong way of calculating it IMHO. In reality those 134% are like 30 something %, but again that's it if we include shares unable to be traded. 30 is a lot on it's own anyway.

That's how I understand the situation with the calculating mess we have now.

Do you think that there are exactly the same liquidity issues or just CLOv. An be popped just enough to try and Shake GME holders as DFV doubles down?

2021-04-17 02:04:44,wallstreetbets,"So I‚Äôm thinking way out here. I watched his first video from July 20 when he took an hour and talked about the stock at $4.  Yea yea lots of attention and insane volumes since but thinking about how this all started and the real potential for the company.  Ryan is going to turn this thing into something with serious value. Not just stock value but revenue to support it. Think about the long term goal here with moving away from the inexpensive used games and retail in the mall to investing in the cloud and global market online.  Many more services than just PS/Xbox.  They have invested in the talent and now have the cash thanks to us apes.  But I really think we fast forward 5 years and we will be like.... Holy shit...  DFV was right when it was $4.00 and no one was even really paying attention.  This was not just a meme stock it was really all about this company reinventing itself.  

Am I wrong here in thinking this.  My ass is holding long long weathering the attacks from shorts and market volatility thinking 2025."

2021-04-17 10:28:35,wallstreetbets,The number of actual shares in circulation. On thier 2020 year end fillings the float was reported as 65 Million.
2021-04-17 10:09:59,wallstreetbets,I think 200%+ is looking more likely; institutions alone claim over 100% and retail on top of that?

2021-04-17 14:02:14,wallstreetbets,GameStop also reports all major shareholds and is unique in that the vast majority of thier share holders are retail investors (about 65% based on thier latest ownership report). This large percentage is due to the shear number of retail investors more than any one individual. Apes are strong together.

The jump was two days and I was somewhere else. 

Fuck Robinhood and fuck that bag of douche Vlad."
2021-04-17 01:36:25,wallstreetbets,Nice portfolio diversity.
2021-04-17 01:56:35,wallstreetbets,Is this really the last day we can discuss GME'ing to the moon?!
2021-04-17 02:47:03,wallstreetbets,"But why RH , can't you transfer it so it counts on the big real world chart?"
2021-04-17 02:52:06,wallstreetbets,You could have a least cash out $1 million when you were at $5 million. But oh well
2021-04-17 02:55:50,wallstreetbets,"Jesus, I‚Äôm a peasant"
2021-04-17 05:35:06,wallstreetbets,"Here's is the thing.

Your floor is 35k from your mortgage, if it never goes below it holding doesnt hurt .
Everything is still a profit."
2021-04-17 08:54:00,wallstreetbets,How can this guy walk around with his massive diamond balls?
2021-04-16 20:31:42,wallstreetbets,"I'm scared you and many others might get screwed over by Robinhood and being restricted from selling when you want at the price you want.

Love the position though"
2021-04-16 20:16:27,wallstreetbets,You‚Äôre a crazy ape to not pull out at 5 mil.

2021-04-16 23:22:23,wallstreetbets,"That's double his initial investment of 30k, so even if he lost it all, he'd still be ahead of 99% of boomers with their 2% yield bonds."

2021-04-16 23:22:36,wallstreetbets,Math says it‚Äôs like 33k so probably just his initial investment.
2021-04-16 21:55:36,wallstreetbets,Just wondering why are these so much better? Also is Webull a good trading app?
2021-04-16 20:21:04,wallstreetbets,Hopefully things change soon for you
2021-04-17 07:08:51,wallstreetbets,Isn't it per day
2021-04-16 20:44:04,wallstreetbets,Betting my house twice!
2021-04-16 20:19:39,wallstreetbets,I did pay it. Then they crashed the stock so I took out my second again and bought more shares on a different brokerage
2021-04-16 20:17:13,wallstreetbets,Yes
2021-04-16 20:23:14,wallstreetbets,Seriously. Why can't we do this with amc?!?!
2021-04-17 02:22:35,wallstreetbets,Really?
2021-04-16 20:33:11,wallstreetbets,"idiot for not being able to tell the future, that shit should have gone to 1000"
2021-04-17 19:44:15,wallstreetbets,"The argument for ""you couldn't tell the future"" is true but they could have easily sold in the 300s. How greedy does someone have to be? The amount of morons in this sub is astounding."
2021-04-17 03:47:35,wallstreetbets,Nov/Dec
2021-04-17 16:47:16,wallstreetbets,You see the one who picked right here but you don't see the fifty  who picked wrong
2021-04-17 14:33:10,wallstreetbets,Bag of crap? What are you talking about?
2021-04-17 00:51:54,wallstreetbets,"I remember you!  Glad you bounced back from the post $5M crash!

Guys he is basically the biggest retard I‚Äôve ever seen on WSB. Can we PLEASE get him a sweet flair?"
2021-04-16 20:15:30,wallstreetbets,"Imagine not sacrificing over $3,000,000 for a meme and being set for life as a multimillionaire."
2021-04-16 21:23:40,wallstreetbets,Fucking well played bro. And it ain't even close to being over yet...
2021-04-16 20:26:10,wallstreetbets,"Can I ask why $5m wasn‚Äôt the time to check out?

Not being malicious or facetious.  Just curious what you were thinking there, and why you held out.

Edit:  love all the indignant and ‚Äúuh AKSUALLY‚Äù responses.  I asked the dude for his perspective, not your interpretations."
2021-04-16 20:26:39,wallstreetbets,How did you not sell at 5 million?  That‚Äôs soooo much money I can‚Äôt even imagine watching that go away.
2021-04-17 09:19:32,wallstreetbets,Imagine not selling at 5 million because a message board of retards told you to hold. You‚Äôre fucking useless
2021-04-16 21:21:43,wallstreetbets,Wow! I would had paper handed when my equity gone to a million dollars
2021-04-16 23:21:13,wallstreetbets,You're my favorite degenerate.

2021-04-16 23:32:26,wallstreetbets,What an ape...

2021-04-17 15:49:42,wallstreetbets,That is awesome. Congrats.
2021-04-17 11:41:39,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs robinhood but honestly don‚Äôt do it they are facing a lot of problems as a brokerage rn.
2021-04-16 20:38:29,wallstreetbets,"Shit, my wife wishes this guy would fuck her. In her dreams."

2021-04-16 20:17:13,wallstreetbets,You got it twisted. No prenup. His wife takes OP's money then this guy divorces his wife and takes half of hers. The playbook is sitting right there.
2021-04-16 21:35:09,wallstreetbets,"In my state prenups are really complicated when you include your wife and her boyfriend in the pre generated forms they have for these situations, you have to write one name in the little color coded boxes letter by letter and then her bf‚Äôs name above it and hope the computer can scan both pieces of info. States need to get with the time and embrace technological change"
2021-04-17 02:17:27,wallstreetbets,*starts building cross*
2021-04-17 09:12:36,wallstreetbets,Yeah but if you plan to buy more open a fidelity account. Mine was cash only and they let me do a good faith purchase with my deposit a day after i submitted it.
2021-04-17 07:34:30,wallstreetbets,That's the shibu inu's motto sir.
2021-04-16 23:02:18,wallstreetbets,"Many reasons. You need to understand payment for order flow because it helps you realize how a 0% commission could provide conflict of interest with companies like Robinhood, citadel, and Melvin. It‚Äôll also help make sense why all 3 of them were in a hearing.

Vanguard and Fidelity are the tried and true veterans without the corruption concerns you get from other brokers"
2021-04-16 20:22:15,wallstreetbets,"Thank you, I hope so. .my Option expired-7100. Still have 68 shares. Going to write puts to get more shares."
2021-04-16 20:36:34,wallstreetbets,Alright now that‚Äôs baller
2021-04-16 20:58:29,wallstreetbets,wow! do you have a screen shot with calls and price paud
2021-04-16 20:30:41,wallstreetbets,"It's a sentiment/ publicity thing now, plus there's no DFV-like entity to tingle everyone's balls. The story of Gamestonk is the one in the spotlight, no other."
2021-04-16 20:41:25,wallstreetbets,IBKR CEO stated it was going to Thousands before being cut off.
2021-04-17 17:03:45,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs a $15 stock at best. This is too much money to just sit and ‚Äúyolo‚Äù. It‚Äôs just foolish. Cash out. You got in nice and early and have now had several chances. Be smart. You have done very very well. Don‚Äôt listen to a bunch of kids holding 2.3 shares telling you to hold.
2021-04-17 03:51:29,wallstreetbets,MODS
2021-04-17 10:57:54,wallstreetbets,"Not a flair to spare, but he can have my upvote boop.  I'll do that with a flourish.  üíéüëêüèª"
2021-04-16 20:46:39,wallstreetbets,Ngl I would have paper handed well before 5 mil (which I did) so respect to ppl like OP who can ride thru these crazy movements.
2021-04-16 22:11:59,wallstreetbets,The guy just got 1.6m. He's still going to be a multimillionaire in 2-3 years as long as he stops YOLOing it on shit lol.
2021-04-17 00:48:05,wallstreetbets,Imagine knowing exactly when to time it to get out. Dude could've got out at 20 times his money and would've been behind a million dollars.
2021-04-17 02:09:02,wallstreetbets,There is someone not understanding value investing right here.
2021-04-17 08:01:30,wallstreetbets,"Well it‚Äôs easy to imagine because most people who make that kind of money *would never* hold and haven‚Äôt so far, not even on this sub lol."
2021-04-17 08:16:45,wallstreetbets,Ikr lol
2021-04-17 02:13:02,wallstreetbets,Blame it on dfw. Insane idiocracy
2021-04-16 20:31:30,wallstreetbets,You must be new here.
2021-04-16 20:59:03,wallstreetbets,5m is the peak in the hindsight. If he paper handed he wouldn‚Äôt have reached 5m.
2021-04-16 20:27:06,wallstreetbets,Because he's not a paper handed little bitch
2021-04-17 02:39:49,wallstreetbets,"You go from 35k to 70k. That‚Äôs a 100% gain, would you not sell? What about 35k to 100k? 500k? Why 5mil? It‚Äôs just hindsight talking. He had diamond hands so if he held through every milestone, why would he sell at 5mil lol"
2021-04-16 21:56:30,wallstreetbets,Because you don't know the top.
2021-04-16 20:35:54,wallstreetbets,Probably got greedy and believed everyone who at the time said the price would continue to $1k.
2021-04-17 16:44:10,wallstreetbets,Because gamblers on winning streaks never know when to stop and walk away happy
2021-04-16 22:17:06,wallstreetbets,Didnt hear?  The new floor is 1.375 Trillion per share.
2021-04-17 01:50:16,wallstreetbets,.
2021-04-17 02:46:04,wallstreetbets,Because he didn't hear no bell
2021-04-17 05:45:21,wallstreetbets,You‚Äôre  gay.
2021-04-17 09:36:51,wallstreetbets,Because the $5MM lasted about 15 seconds. It isn‚Äôt quite as simple as it may appear to be in hindsight.
2021-04-17 12:27:44,wallstreetbets,UH AKSUALLY he just liked the stonk
2021-04-16 21:58:36,wallstreetbets,Aaaaaaand you're a schill
2021-04-16 21:02:35,wallstreetbets,"Odds are you couldn‚Äôt imagine watching 1 million go away either, or half a million, but this guy had to hold at those values to make it to 5 million. See where I‚Äôm going with this?"
2021-04-16 21:39:36,wallstreetbets,">How did you not sell at 5 million?  

Probably because they thought it would go to 6 million."
2021-04-16 21:16:11,wallstreetbets,Because he knows he's going to walk away with 50 million when this is over.
2021-04-17 00:08:16,wallstreetbets,"Oh no how they allowed chernobyl to explode?! It was so simple...

Yeah.. create your time machine and make the best choices in your life... easy right?"
2021-04-16 20:16:54,wallstreetbets,My gf wouldn't fuck a dude using RH

2021-04-17 00:47:21,wallstreetbets,"I tried to transfer my account over to Fidelity and the whole transfer got denied because I have some fractional shares. 

Also, their app is pretty shitty."

2021-04-17 09:36:00,wallstreetbets,How much does vanguard charge?
2021-04-16 21:22:26,wallstreetbets,I would had paper handed when my unrealized gains went usd 1 mil
2021-04-16 20:51:37,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm not sure respect is the word you should be reaching for when he walked away from guaranteed retirement.
2021-04-16 22:41:41,wallstreetbets,Respect? He gave up $3.4 million dollars because dIaMoNd HaNdS
2021-04-17 01:07:41,wallstreetbets,~~stops~~ keeps
2021-04-17 02:22:12,wallstreetbets,Define ‚Äùshit‚Äù?
2021-04-17 16:42:49,wallstreetbets,Whats the saying? Casino always wins? He will give it back eventually lol i can do it again! Womp womp waaa
2021-04-17 06:32:17,wallstreetbets,Hes gonna lose it all. That's always how this end. I am happy dfv cashed some.
2021-04-17 02:27:47,wallstreetbets,lol you did a w instead of a V
2021-04-16 22:31:41,wallstreetbets,Because at 5m why wouldn't he assume it would just continue to move to 6m in another 10 minutes like it did to go from 4m to 5m!?
2021-04-16 22:28:28,wallstreetbets,"Nobody should be reaching for the peak. If I saw $5M I woulda sold no doubt about it. Even if the stock mooned to $10M I wouldn‚Äôt have had any regrets. $5M puts me in a position to retire at 40 rather than 62. Hell, I woulda sold if the stock plateaued at $2M for like 15minutes rather than exploding exponentially.

And stop saying selling is ‚Äúpaperhanding‚Äù. You guys have no idea what that actually means if you just say selling in general is paperhanding. You‚Äôre only paperhanding when you sell at a loss and you ‚Äúdiamond hand‚Äù when you hold through those steep losses and come out the other end back on top."
2021-04-16 22:26:47,wallstreetbets,Selling at $5M isn‚Äôt paperhanding... paperhanding is selling at a loss cus you panic. Get your definitions straight lol. If you sold at $5M after $36k investment you‚Äôre a legend not a ‚Äúpaper handed bitch‚Äù like you cucks like to keep saying. Stop trying to push the prisoner‚Äôs dilemma on people.
2021-04-16 21:43:57,wallstreetbets,Yes this guy has fucking dfv balls ... waiting for it to moon so he can save the world
2021-04-16 20:38:47,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm sure.  Was just asking the dude in a more fortunate position than myself.
2021-04-16 22:36:55,wallstreetbets,It hit 480. Everyday it was riding the options chain up as new calls were released. Thinking it would make it to the 800 strike wasn't crazy. And if they had not stopped buys I think it would've from the gamma ramp
2021-04-17 02:23:08,wallstreetbets,Yes but the thing is it most definitely would have gone to 1K or more if buying wasnt literally halted
2021-04-16 22:28:42,wallstreetbets,Not quite right to call him greedy when they stopped all buying of GME at that time.
2021-04-17 07:41:05,wallstreetbets,"Perhaps he's just in a different tax bracket than we are same like at a blackjack, craps table high rollers and low rollers... his play money gorilla and ape shitt strong"
2021-04-17 12:05:45,wallstreetbets,Believed? It WAS going to.
2021-04-16 21:59:43,wallstreetbets,"This guy DIDN'T make 5 million though. That, did not happen."
2021-04-17 15:12:51,wallstreetbets,Easy to say but not in reality. I took 25k to 250k that day and did not sell. Expectation was the squeeze was just starting. Had restrictions not kicked in it would have gone a lot higher for sure.
2021-04-16 22:45:23,wallstreetbets,"Well, still sell enough to get a million and let the rest play."
2021-04-16 20:24:36,wallstreetbets,"Now THAT'S retarded, at that size portfolio he prob has a share of AMZN"

2021-04-16 20:20:12,wallstreetbets,"You act like this is going to reach 10,000,000 by Wednesday lol dude the best time to transfer was yesterday and the second best time is now. Fucking do it. You have a 100000000√ó better chance of getting fucked by RH during the squeeze than you do of the squeeze happening during your transfer.

Edit: I'm saying this as someone who has absolutely 0 willpower and the worst procrastination habits you could imagine. I did a partial transfer weeks ago, and my second/full account transfer went through about a week ago. Please, please do not hesitate."
2021-04-16 20:16:21,wallstreetbets,Then you're in the completely wrong sub bubba.
2021-04-17 07:21:02,wallstreetbets,"I initiated a partial transfer of only my GME to fidelity at 1am yesterday, it was completed the same day. I  bought a call 4 weeks out and left that on RH to ease my worries, but it turns out it was unnecessary."
2021-04-17 10:37:23,wallstreetbets,I personally just started a transfer of 90% of my shares yesterday. I bought enough calls to cover myself if it happens this week just in case so I won‚Äôt be missing shit.
2021-04-17 08:52:35,wallstreetbets,I just did a partial transfer and it worked fine. I still have .8 shares in robinhood.
2021-04-17 10:30:19,wallstreetbets,Gotta hold til at least 2 mil.  You still want to be a millionaire after the government takes half.
2021-04-17 08:01:16,wallstreetbets,That's my end goal. I'm still a long way away
2021-04-16 21:01:40,wallstreetbets,"Uhh, well to get to 5 million he had to not sell at 1 million, 2 million, 3 million, etc., and if it hadn‚Äôt climbed so high people might be calling him stupid for not selling at 1m, or for selling at 5m when he could‚Äôve had 10m. Calling the top isn‚Äôt easy."
2021-04-17 02:55:08,wallstreetbets,Have you heard of this thing called taxes?
2021-04-17 05:44:28,wallstreetbets,ü§°
2021-04-17 06:30:46,wallstreetbets,Commenting to come back to this.
2021-04-16 22:35:24,wallstreetbets,Yeah man. That was a cracked 48 hours of chaos and he also had to deal with the anxiety of RH cock blocking his ability to buy if he sold that day. That alone changed a lot of minds about selling.
2021-04-17 00:53:01,wallstreetbets,remember it's all on RH and we all know what happened on that platform during those hours
2021-04-16 23:42:37,wallstreetbets,"Everyone has their target ""insta-sell"" number.  Perhaps his was simply higher.  I personally would have been out anytime after $1M at the first sign of trouble.

That was such a f'ing crazy day though!"
2021-04-17 00:28:23,wallstreetbets,"You would have sold if 35K went to $45K...Based on your logic he should have sold earlier, but when, at $50K, 100K, 200K, 300K, 3M, 4M? 
What‚Äôs your rule for selling on a gain? Whatever it is, you would never have made the gains this guy did.  I wouldn‚Äôt either, but I wouldn‚Äôt judge him for holding"
2021-04-17 00:01:35,wallstreetbets,Underrated reply right there.  ‚¨ÜÔ∏è‚¨ÜÔ∏è
2021-04-17 10:25:39,wallstreetbets,"If I cashed in $5M, I would literally retire on the spot. Done. Not working one single day longer."
2021-04-17 11:59:15,wallstreetbets,"He couldn't sell it because they halted purchases. You can sell if nobody can buy, right?"
2021-04-17 14:16:35,wallstreetbets,So true. Bunch of idiots
2021-04-16 22:46:55,wallstreetbets,"For real lmao.  Imagine turning $35k into $5M and being worried about a bunch of poor and stupid neckbeards with 5 shares calling you a ""paper handed bitch""."
2021-04-17 00:57:10,wallstreetbets,Stop pushing paper hands on people.
2021-04-17 03:16:16,wallstreetbets,"Paperhanding a profit because you're afraid to lose it or have lost some of it already is paperhanding.

Get *your* definitions straight, paperhands"
2021-04-16 22:08:31,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs simple really. He saw 5 but wanted 10.
2021-04-16 22:49:03,wallstreetbets,I agree. But to let 5 million dollars dwindle to $300k is just careless. Profit is profit.
2021-04-16 22:32:42,wallstreetbets,It's greedy when you make 5 million and you think that's not enough and you hold until it's back to 300k.
2021-04-16 22:28:47,wallstreetbets,"Right, but he also didn‚Äôt make half a million either. Or one million. My point being, perfect timing is incredibly difficult. Good timing alone is worth a commend."
2021-04-16 20:26:50,wallstreetbets,You‚Äôre fine on Robinhood if you make your account a cash account. The margin accounts will prob be screwed tho
2021-04-16 22:18:29,wallstreetbets,A lot of other brokers blocked trading on GME at the same time as Robinhood
2021-04-17 09:39:20,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, it just restarted the timeline though."
2021-04-16 21:14:00,wallstreetbets,I always find it so funny how judgemental people on this sub are on other people's decisions AFTER they know how it all plays out. Dat hindsight 20/20
2021-04-16 21:24:35,wallstreetbets,"exactly this. making $1m out of $30k is impressive as fuck itself, the man isn‚Äôt a psychic"
2021-04-16 22:38:07,wallstreetbets,"The issue is the declining marginal utility of the dollar - you don't need to get out at the top, you just need to get out when you don't need any more money.

Very few people wouldn't be comfortable living off of a $5 million portfolio for life."
2021-04-16 21:28:04,wallstreetbets,"This should be pinned in life, for all adults to see."
2021-04-17 09:34:18,wallstreetbets,"It's not about calling the top, it's calling it quits when you get to retirement money."
2021-04-16 22:49:58,wallstreetbets,Humphhh. I never looked at it like that before .
2021-04-17 00:24:40,wallstreetbets,"ThisüëÜ. A lot of people do not realize or seem to remember what happened those couple of days. I never actually got to see the 5 million except when looking back on my chart. 

Does no one remember the flash crash from $483 to $112?"
2021-04-16 22:44:42,wallstreetbets,"That was insane. RH fucked so many people. I have E\*trade and got fucked by them as they limited trading as well. That day made it blatantly obviously to me that retail traders could be fucked at all cost to protect the interests of the big machine‚Äîovertly, or in broad day light. People need to be held responsible for this. This was an open display of the bully needing to cheat and getting a head nod from the good ol' boys club."
2021-04-17 10:33:12,wallstreetbets,I would judge him he‚Äôs another legend. This is not done yet. IMO
2021-04-17 00:32:22,wallstreetbets,Nah the stock literally exploded exponentially. I would have sold at the first sign of resistance or when the spike would start to drop so probably around $1.2M assuming I had the same amount of shares
2021-04-17 00:06:58,wallstreetbets,"not underrated, overrated... as this is NOT the audience for that reply ü¶ß"
2021-04-17 13:45:17,wallstreetbets,What an awful way to refer to your fellow apes.
2021-04-17 03:34:09,wallstreetbets,Paper hands can't push anything silly
2021-04-17 10:08:00,wallstreetbets,"Yall are so stupid lmao... wtf is the point of ""investing"" any amount of money if according to you you're never allowed to sell it. 

Might as well just throw X amount of money in the trash because it'd be worth the same there as it would as an investment that you'll never cash out on."
2021-04-16 22:56:58,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I begrudgingly sold at 180 like a chump. Only regret is not buying back in under 50üôÉ

Also not selling at the original meme target of 420.69 which was damn near optimal"
2021-04-16 22:46:47,wallstreetbets,"Uhh I know what happened you don't have to repeat it, and it's not greedy. You just sound jealous dude."
2021-04-16 22:35:43,wallstreetbets,Whatever loser.
2021-04-16 20:30:27,wallstreetbets,You've got to be kidding me lmfao were you not around for the first squeeze? These assholes will do anything to fuck us over.
2021-04-17 00:28:40,wallstreetbets,LOL Robinhood doesn‚Äôt have the capital to trade GME at these levels. They can‚Äôt afford to put up the money if IV goes 400% again.
2021-04-16 23:18:44,wallstreetbets,If you trade options you can‚Äôt have a cash account on robinhood.
2021-04-16 22:20:16,wallstreetbets,Thats true. I switched to TD Ameritrade who answered questions about the potential squeeze and they said that they were making adjustments and expanding their team to be able to serve us better. Robinhood couldnt give a straight answer when asked if they would stop trading again.
2021-04-16 21:46:49,wallstreetbets,"Investing is so fucking easy, just put your money in stocks that are going to go up. Don't put your money in stocks that will go down. EZPZ. üêí"
2021-04-16 23:36:44,wallstreetbets,This is why the only right answer to what super power you would want is time control.
2021-04-17 00:22:55,wallstreetbets,Best comment
2021-04-16 22:28:33,wallstreetbets,"It ain‚Äôt hindsight if you‚Äôve gone through retirement planning, having savings goals, and know your number. I would have 2000% cashed out at 5m because that IS my retirement number.  Fuck fomoing 10m or chancing losing it, I‚Äôd have cashed no questions asked."
2021-04-16 22:29:04,wallstreetbets,I'm pretty good at turning 60k into 24k. Never seems to go the other way for me lol .
2021-04-17 00:52:20,wallstreetbets,"I would, you kidding?

Buy a house outright for like, $300k, keep 2 mil in a bank account for general living, put the rest in long term TFSA ETF investment plans. Guarenteed retirement for you and your kids.

I'd take the money in a heartbeat."
2021-04-17 01:31:43,wallstreetbets,"It was pure Guh

And then the flood of numbness after it came back to 300 plus. It was years of life leaving the body"
2021-04-17 06:35:03,wallstreetbets,The crash from 483 to 112 was 8 million volume only. How fucked is that.
2021-04-17 16:55:56,wallstreetbets,"Oh trust me I do. I was up $110,000 from a $15,000 investment in GME, AMC, BB, NOK. I woke up that morning and saw AMC at 400% increase, I had so many chances to sell it but I didn't. I believed that it would have went up higher after 9:30, then 9:30 comes market opens, and it went down, then it went down even more after the blockage from RH and other platforms. I was eyeing the stock price of GME, AMC, NOK, BB like a hawk that day. I even set my sell limit to $420.69, but I cancelled it because I got greedy and deleted that sell limit."
2021-04-16 22:58:13,wallstreetbets,"There was some fuck on cnbc saying they shut us down to protect the system. What the fuck does that even mean? You lost and couldn't pay up, that's what."
2021-04-17 00:26:18,wallstreetbets,"Everyone is after Robinhood. The day of the robbery I could not login into my TD Ameritrade and once I got in, I could not buy GME. Robinhood and several broker were part of this"
2021-04-16 23:46:56,wallstreetbets,I left E*trade because of this. Pisses me off that nobody talks about the other platforms outside of RH.
2021-04-17 09:05:39,wallstreetbets,i bought on etrade during the rocket ride up to 400.  i saw no restrictions at all.
2021-04-17 01:50:39,wallstreetbets,same here.
2021-04-17 10:26:28,wallstreetbets,"It's not about never selling.

It's about not selling out of ""what if it'll go down?!"" and missing out on a lot of money because your fear of loss is greater than your fear of missing out."
2021-04-16 23:14:54,wallstreetbets,How am I jealous of someone losing 5.7 million and only making back a fraction of it? You're not too bright.
2021-04-17 03:06:48,wallstreetbets,"Okay winner, gl with your portfolio."
2021-04-17 11:22:06,wallstreetbets,You lost the argument
2021-04-17 00:31:54,wallstreetbets,They have no choice
2021-04-16 23:30:45,wallstreetbets,"Yeah that‚Äôs true, idc about options though"
2021-04-17 00:26:59,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs about capital risk in counterparty default though, are they willing to put their nuts on the block for GME when the risk is their collateral (and how much collateral do they have). 
I‚Äôll say it, Robinhood didn‚Äôt have a choice. They were too small to sit at the big boy brokers table, and still are."
2021-04-17 01:07:05,wallstreetbets,"I could not login to my TD Ameritrade account on the day they stopped us from trading. When I finally got in, I couldn't buy GME."
2021-04-16 22:16:08,wallstreetbets,So you‚Äôre saying buy more GME?
2021-04-16 22:05:06,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm not sure if I would call this investing.
2021-04-16 22:29:55,wallstreetbets,Why wouldn‚Äôt you have cashed out at 2.5m? That‚Äôs half your retirement money and could have become your retirement money with a few years of more conservative investing. And why not 1m for that matter?
2021-04-17 03:38:20,wallstreetbets,"Sorry, this was basically a double negative. By ""few wouldn't be comfortable"" I meant ""most would find it very comfortable"" to retire on $5 million."

2021-04-17 14:16:18,wallstreetbets,Fidelity also wouldn‚Äôt allow selling. It would just spin and spin and spin then error out

""Never sell! It'll keep going up!"""

2021-04-17 00:35:01,wallstreetbets,"They have no choice but to shut down their platform trading in volatile stocks, so it‚Äôs best to have your shares in a platform that has proven stability for major market events."

2021-04-17 11:54:10,wallstreetbets,Exactly. Too many apes get swept up in emotion and don‚Äôt realize this. The groupthink is real and quite dangerous.

2021-04-16 22:37:50,wallstreetbets,"Well, to be frank, because that‚Äôs the goal of the money I invest in things like GME. It‚Äôs not a good investment, it‚Äôs a meme. I call my bets onto things like this assymetric investments. It‚Äôs a small part of my portfolio I‚Äôm willing to bet on stupid shit to try and hit my number. Not 1/5th or 2/5ths of my number. If you don‚Äôt know your goals then you don‚Äôt know when to get out."
2021-04-17 18:57:47,wallstreetbets,"Oh, alright. Yeah, 5 million is a nice number. With 1 million, half of that is gone after you buy a house and a decent car, and probably wont last for general living costs/buying stuff for your kids. 2 million might also be an ok option."
2021-04-17 12:13:25,wallstreetbets,"Thomas had never seen such bullshit before, eh?"
2021-04-17 16:26:13,wallstreetbets,He'll turn trading back on at the _real_ price of 40 dollars!
2021-04-17 10:50:55,wallstreetbets,"Right, at witch point you'll sell after the peak, not before it."
2021-04-17 00:43:08,wallstreetbets,Maybe for buying but they will allow selling
2021-04-17 03:05:09,wallstreetbets,Maybe this guy‚Äôs number was 6 million ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
2021-04-17 10:55:01,wallstreetbets,"Yea, and tell me Mr. Crystal Ball, when will the peak be? Because according to your logic, you shouldn't even sell ""after the peak"" because you never know if it'd go BACK up. So you'd be selling on the fear of losing money. The logic is infinite and convinces people to basically hold until they lose money because they'll NEVER sell"
2021-04-17 00:44:53,wallstreetbets,"The choice is not theirs, they do not have enough capital to make their own decisions. They do what they are told by DTCC."
2021-04-17 03:20:44,wallstreetbets,This is just the perfect response. Well done
2021-04-17 10:59:33,wallstreetbets,"Again, paperhanding is about *fear*, not taking profit."
2021-04-17 00:57:49,wallstreetbets,DTCC will give them the capital for us to sell shares. They NEED us to sell.
2021-04-17 11:17:15,wallstreetbets,"Except, once again, if you sell ""after the peak"" (assuming you somehow know its the peak), it means you FEAR you will lose money if you don't."
2021-04-17 01:13:30,wallstreetbets,"Eventually sure, but not necessarily during the most volatile moments. 

During major market events DTCC will tell Robinhood to sit down and shut up."

2021-04-17 04:51:13,wallstreetbets,Ok well you convinced me. Transferred my shares to my fidelity account. It‚Äôs gonna take 9 days thoüò≥do you think the squeeze will happen between now and then?
2021-04-17 05:14:24,wallstreetbets,"I haven‚Äôt done it myself, but I heard it should take 2 if everything is in order.

It‚Äôs a risk for sure, I left my position in my original shit-tier app broker and just started buying my shares in others to help manage that risk.

2021-04-17 12:15:17,wallstreetbets,"I have 1,000 shares over $10 that I‚Äôve had for awhile and been watching get dicked down hard by shorts. Rescue me brothers. I almost sold CC‚Äôs on price movement lately, but I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt."
2021-04-17 05:46:22,wallstreetbets,"Of all the post and comments on $CLOV not 1, not a single 1, discussed the fundamentals of the company. No discussions regarding the future of the company, its current financial position and possible growth in the future.

All I see are posts saying SqUeeZe buy ShOrT inTresT 140%.

GME actually had someone in RC coming in with a plan to transform the company and so much DD arguing for and against their possible turnaround. 

This company is a technology based insurance provider connecting PPO and HMO to customers trying to find a network that is accepted by their insurance. Its not a new industry and it's already fucking crowded with the big insurance companies.

Edit: I forgot to add that they are being investigated by the DoJ for illegal representation of sales by using kickbacks and other schemes to inflate numbers. They filed an 8-k about this last year."
2021-04-16 22:33:48,wallstreetbets,This is solid squeeze opportunity. Let get them shorties. üöÄüöÄüöÄ

2021-04-16 20:38:53,wallstreetbets,I debated buying a spread but the IV on this is killer.  If volume doesn‚Äôt keep up IV will drop - so will the option price.   I watched S0S run up last week for a day then came right back down so I‚Äôm skeptical on this one.
2021-04-17 12:19:00,wallstreetbets,"Rough times. I'm like that with Metromile. In the case of Clov you can fall back on the BOA valuation of $15, that no SEC investigation does more then a light slap on the wrist and that you got a bunch of apes who got your back and are coming. Hold!"
2021-04-16 21:07:09,wallstreetbets,"A gamma squeeze needs ramps at different price points.  I know you are probably abbreviating by saying how many shares if it gets to $20, but its helpful for others to know.  Luckily, there ARE plenty of ramps at $10, $12.5, $15, and then a bit more at $17.50 and $20.  

While I like the play, also keep in mind call prices went through the fucking roof today."
2021-04-16 21:32:45,wallstreetbets,21th lmao. ok mike tyson.
2021-04-17 08:06:36,wallstreetbets,"Appreciate the point. I will not there are already fantastic deep dives on WSB explaining the company, why it's great, why the SEC investigation won't amount to much at all, the extremely passionate CEO and the fact that this is one of the largest markets in the US to not have a disruptor over the last decade. Happy to deep dive, but this was just a news post."
2021-04-17 12:41:12,wallstreetbets,"I can give it my best shot. It went up, then it went down, now it's going up. In the future I believe it will go up or down."

2021-04-16 20:28:14,wallstreetbets,Seems to me that PLTR is a defense play.  Could be huge with tensions w  across borders.
2021-04-16 20:45:10,wallstreetbets,"Pltr is such a dog.  I‚Äôm bag holding at 35.  

AAPL has the highest chance of all .  Product reveal next week and we may see an earnings run up too.

I like tsla but man is it volatile/ unpredictable.

Spy has had a hell of a run and due for a correction but with all the positive economic news it may continue to run.

Edit - thanks for the solid TA .  Nice work!"
2021-04-16 20:35:28,wallstreetbets,"Would love to get your thoughts on VIAC, can't seem to find support anywhere and RSI in the oversold ranges day on day. Are the banks still dumping??"

2021-04-17 09:18:46,wallstreetbets,"It had a run last year and you could make easy money out of it. It was fine to make something out of it.

But the company is really fucked up in the longterm. Not because of the product, it is more like the fucked up financial construct behind the company. It is created to make Soros and friends rich, not people like us."
2021-04-17 16:22:14,wallstreetbets,"As long as the correction doesn‚Äôt come too soon (which it doesn‚Äôt look like, since big tech earnings are still coming) your calls might actually break even and even go significantly in the green depending on your expiry. Good luck"

2021-04-17 14:24:22,wallstreetbets,Didn‚Äôt they do this in February?

2021-04-16 20:08:56,wallstreetbets,Right on. Formatting.
2021-04-17 12:22:24,wallstreetbets,"Thank you....the first honest, straightforward answer. I see clearly a WWE event here, with Soros-Thiel tagteamming working with WallStreetBets ""operatives"" to keep the sheep buying or holding PLTR. Like you, I also see long term disaster for this company, and I'm looking for some intelligent people to prove otherwise. This constant chatter about apes and retards and crayons and other moronic speech makes this place sound like an insane asylum."
2021-04-17 16:19:15,wallstreetbets,"General rule of thumb is you want to have 60 candles+ on your chart to identify a trend. On the 30 minute chart, there are 13 candles per trading day, x7 days is 91 candles. So he‚Äôs just making sure to have more than 60 candles, and negate any chart volume bias by going back 1.5 (trading) weeks, unless he has some other more specific reason. Hope this helps!"
2021-04-17 16:37:05,wallstreetbets,"Sorry, so they did. Research note I read was an update on double click day and just reiterating their price target."

I'm so fucking stoked for DFV, by the sound of the congressional hearing he has had a fucking tough time. His wife's boyfriend can retire now and it couldn't have happened to a nicer bloke. 

What a great example of self-belief and generosity with knowledge. Not in an arrogant or showy way and he never got defensive when challenged. I haven't looked that hard but from what I've seen from his past posts before January he was just always himself. 

It's all played out so publicly and my mind is just blown. Regardless of the money I take from this play I think that's the lesson I learned through this wild ride. Self-belief and generosity with knowledge. It's so simple."

Even though I'm one of those background, inconsequential apes with only 7 shares, what's transpired here makes me feel like I'm part of history now. Not named, like you'll be, DFV, but I'm there. And that makes me happy and feels like it's given my life a purpose. Maybe I really can break out of this wage slavery bullshit. Maybe I really can go ""where lambo"" and have it **not** be sarcastic. And for all of that, I thank you, u/deepfuckingvalue . Thank you."

This is the 2nd to last comment in that thread, and when I read it, it gave me goosebumps, especially after watching the cheers video from today. Talk about full circle.

You have brought light to a dark world. You have shown us all how to fight against our oppressors in a way many never thought possible. You alone started what will certainly be one of the most defining points in all of human history. You have done the impossible. Thank you for everything.

All hail DFV!"
2021-04-16 21:33:09,wallstreetbets,"Keith,

You are an absolute legend! You have inspired an entire generation of investors. You probably didn't realize what you were getting into when you started posting on WSB and streaming on YouTube. This is bigger than anyone could have imagined. I've watched your videos, and I understand you like the stock. This was never about trying to cash in on a gama squeeze, take your profits and run. You like the stock! You see it has VALUE! But some things generate thier own momentum, and once started they can't be stopped. In the process the hedge funds have been exposed for what they are, the SEC is being called out, and some positive changes are in our near future.

I like the stock as well! I see good things for it in the future and plan on holding some of my few shares even after the squeeze and reinvesting when it settles down. I'm hoping our fellow apes feel the same! I doubt you'll see this buried in the thousands of responses you've received, but if you ever find yourself in Western Mass sometime, I'd love to buy you a beer!

Best of wishes to you and your family, from me and my family!"
2021-04-16 21:33:23,wallstreetbets,Thank you sir! When this is over I hope to watch you streaming some awesome games. All apes that game can hit me up for my gamer tag (I play on most systems). Love you all! What a time to be alive/own GME.

Its not often you see 2000% returns on an investment, and even though I didn't sell all my shares at the top, I was able to turn my $1600 investment into 25k in only a few weeks as a noobie investor.

I‚Äôd exercise that shit too! I don‚Äôt imagine why he wouldn‚Äôt have actually exercised every damn contract, and turned around and sold all but 200k shares to realize the gains... I‚Äôm very confused why people buying more shares was a separate act than exercising, smfh.

Basically if you do the opposite of what the majority will think will happen, you stand to gain the most money. Of course that means you are also likely to lose money. Right now everyone is focused on GameStop, and the poster here was the big voice who put his money where his mouth was and said that game stop wasn't going to go bankrupt like the majority thought would.  DFV has rode the stock from $2 to $150, and with this update revealed that he actually bought more saying yeah, I might have just won the lottery, but I'm going to bet it's going to happen again."

2021-04-17 19:36:01,wallstreetbets,"He purchased 500 Call option contracts with a strike price of $12 many months ago, which gives him the right to exercise the contracts if the share price in the market are above the strike price. As these contracts are now deep in the money due to the share price being much much higher than the strike, he exercises the contracts to purchase 50k shares (500 contracts x 100 shares/contract) at $12 per share."

Compare the ridiculous amount of stock covered by OOTM options against the float and the average daily volume.  It's clear that an absolute shitton of people were buying calls on this thing months ago when it first hit the market for no reason.

This is just the mechanics of OOTM calls being unwound that has caused this thing to continually drift lower for almost a month.

**SPY 6/18 $320** calls are at the last price of **98.00** which gives us a total value of:

2021-04-17 15:02:22,wallstreetbets,"Looking for some feedback from the weekend people.

I've been thinking about the whole megathread thing for a while. I think when we make long-term megathreads we end up creating a silo of users that can be out of sync with the rest of the sub.

I stickied a comment in the non-gme daily two days ago about how we were going to cut down on spammy GME-related content, that was upvoted fairly vigorously. Meanwhile, the comment ending the gme daily thread was downvoted to oblivion (earning me an inciteful comment trophy) and drew a lot of flak from other subs, was seen as a betrayal, proof of selling out, etc.

To me, that says that we have two large groups of users and they're congregating in different threads, yet they're forced to share the same submission queue. That can't be ideal.

In the future we think we're going to declare megathreads more sparingly and give them an expiration date up front so nobody is surprised and so we don't create more compartmentalization.

Whatcha think?"

2021-04-17 01:27:13,wallstreetbets,"One time when I was working as a lifeguard, the pool was going to be opened for the evening on a very chilly night with some light rain.  Regular management wasn't around, so assistant manager was in charge.  The dude only wanted to open because he hadn't had the opportunity to be in charge before.  It was his first time, ever.  We knew the pool shouldn't have been opened for the late shift, nobody was coming to swim, and we were going to be miserable... so we revolted.

We needed someone to take a shit.

On our dinner break, assistant manager went home and the rest of us stayed.  We brewed coffee and chain smoked cigarettes in the parking lot.  Someone went to pick up 20 McDonald's $1 cheeseburgers.  It was a race, of sorts.

I won the race.

I took a dump and scooped out some of it with a Styrofoam cereal bowl.  My coworker, who went on to become a Navy SEAL, gloved up and held out a Ziploc bag.  I dumped the turd nugget into the bag with some water, he sealed it, and the bag was tucked away.

AssMgr came back, we opened up for the 2 hour night shift,  and we were handed guard chair assignments.  The bag went with the lifeguard stationed at the top of the slide, and she dumped the piece of shit down the current.  The guard at the bottom of the slide blew twice for manager attention

""I think we have fecal in the pool!""

It was scooped and confirmed fecal.  We must have missed it in the afternoon shift.

So, the assistant manager was furious.  While it had been soaking in water in a baggie for an hour, it was still pretty clearly a fresh shit, and it hadn't just been rolling around the bottom of the pool in perfect turd shape.  It doesn't escape from swim trunk poop catcher nets that neatly.  But, there was nothing he could do.  He couldn't prove it, and procedures are procedures.  We shocked the pool with chemicals and closed up shop.

Then we went and drank some beers in someone's back yard. üçª"

2021-04-17 17:38:16,wallstreetbets,"We all have neighbors in our neighborhoods or apartment buildings or cardboard boxes. As different people, most of us respect the differences of other people in good faith and tend to be tolerable neighbors. However, when the neighbor has a raging party that spills onto your property, hoards trash in their yard, and disturbs the surrounding community so much that it becomes objectively intolerable then it is time to draw the line.

High risk bets and speculative DD is one thing. Propagating absolute insanity and borderline fraud to rescue bad positions or, at best, proliferate financial ignorance is bad faith and toxic for this community.

It‚Äôs hard and people bitch but this is long overdue. Too many good ideas (and memes) have been smothered by a long dead play. Hold your ground."

2021-04-17 01:10:23,wallstreetbets,"I feel like this is the end of a long summer camp vacation - that greatest one you had during middle school. The one where all your best mates were with you, the one where you had daily talks around the campfire, maybe waxing about if growing up was all it was cracked out to be. Maybe it was the first one where you mustered enough courage to tell that blonde girl you've always seen in your town - but always scared to talk to - that you have feelings for her. Whatever exact thoughts or physical touches you had then might be gone, but that warm feeling of fuzziness will always stay with you. 

&#x200B;

The details of what has happened two decades ago has largely faded away, but you will always remember those small things - your friend's honest and scared confession of not knowing the future, the girl walking over to you after seeing you smiling, the day DFV came back after the initial drop from 300 to 100 and showed you he not only diamond handed, but added more. Remember how one loose band of internet keyboard warriors with but a hundo to their name came together to make some money, but more so showed the world that diamond handed apes were here to make a statement. Yes some of our friends - who only had fleeting screenshots of their April $400 calls - are no longer with us, but you will also remember them around the same campfire, relishing in the same thoughts and sharing the same fears. 

&#x200B;

The camp might have ended. The campfire discussion thread might be nothing more than a pile of bricks, smoothed by the encouragement, discussion, and empathy shared by everyone who was around it at one time or another. But the ring of sequoias, if you look hard enough in the forest, will always be there. Maybe one day, after finding everyone again or by inviting new friends, a new prayer circle just as lively  will rekindle the flames of auld. 

Whatever the new topic is going to be, it's not going to be Palantir.

2021-04-17 18:45:16,wallstreetbets,"Hello. I'd like to share my thoughts, even if I get hate for it. I have been on reddit since 2005 (this is obviously not my original account). I joined WSB like so many others because of all the hype. I have been in the GME megathread every day for weeks now and it is a crazy place. Almost everyone is having a great time. When the stock rises, the energy is amazing. When it goes down, we act like the cool kids that don't care. If it goes sideways, I myself will post stupid things like magic tricks or silly songs to keep people from being bored. I just love the community that came together. Unfortunately I never dared to post anything in the daily thread because I saw how GME people were treated. I also got extremely sad when daily thread people would come in droves to comment thing to bring down the mood. We are just trying to have fun. I will not ""invade"" the daily thread out of protest. I don't want to ruin a place where people want to be left alone about GME. I respect that. But now the sudden removal of the thread has left most of us out in the cold. We had no time to figure out where to go so we can all stay together.  I have always been a person that wants everyone on reddit to make money with whatever they choose to invest in. I cannot even imagine not liking people for the stocks they choose. I will continue to root for each and every person and hope they make it big. I also want to ask if you would consider giving us the thread back for even a week or two so that some of us can figure out a new place to all go together. This would also allow us to inform people of the move with enough notice. If you choose not to do that, I still want to thank the mods for their good work and for giving us a place to have fun while it lasted.
I hope everyone here has a good weekend and a great market open on monday, regardless what you invested in."
2021-04-17 17:26:51,wallstreetbets,"Bit late to the party but here's my 2 cents. I don't want the daily full of Apes talking about the stock move up or down 2$. The palantards do that already but thankfully there's like 3 of them lol. Daily should be about options or plays that are hot right now imo. I'm also an ape but i don't have my whole portfolio in GME. I enjoy the daily to throw some money this way or the other based on literally nothing but 1 guy being like ""üåàüêª's are fuk"".

I think while the Megathread still hits the frontpage everyday it should stick around. There's clearly high demand still but it will die down, just like these things always do. It's not the people's fault that just when we had like 1 very boring week and things start to slow down, the stock gains 20% again in a day, or DFV buys another 100k shares. Or earnings drops it 70 bucks for one day and shoots back up the next. But it will normalise eventually. I just think the timing to remove it right now was kinda bad.

The subs frontpage is definetly a mess though and feels like i'm seeing the same 10 posts over and over, especially with the gains/loss posts. But i think there's much better ways to counteract those. Like ban unrealized gains/loss posts on GME for example. That would already cut down on like 40% of the posts (If it's good enough to screenshot it's good enough yada yada)

Basically what i'm getting at is that i think you should keep the thread around for a while longer. It'll just die down naturally as the stock normalizes and things stop happening. Yeah it's a bit of a special treatment for GME but it's safe to say that atleast a big chunk of people joined the sub because of it, so it is a special situation and based on the amount of upvotes and comments on the megathread the time to end it just hasn't come quite yet.

sorry for the long read, i know you're busy. Would love to hear your thoughts though /u/zjz"

To ban talk of it is ridiculous. Just because some people don't like the company, or are salty about missing the boat, that's no reason to ban. Things like GME or the doggy thing are perfect examples of how we all could be working to change the market and force things to react to a collective will rather than sit here and let ""fundamental"" forces decide how things are gonna move. You know what I want to ban? AAPL. People getting all hyped about a stock that goes up or down by a few bucks each week. I want talk of stocks that move, huge percentages in short times, based on how people decide they should move. I want meme trends. I have never made this kind of money trading traditional. Ban GME?

When bullish investors jumped on after seeing the initial rise from covering, they could have just shorted at $200+ again (which is what I've seen some companies trying to estimate the short interest over time say they believe happened)

Edit:  if you‚Äôre curious, the following networks are all dealbreakers:
ESPN, CBS, MTV, TLC, AMC, Lifetime, CNBC, FOX Business"

2021-04-17 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Biotechs : Market completely missed the news of the week LONG $XBI $LABU You all are familiar with $XBI it's a whole freaking ETF that is equally weighted and has all the bio techs inside of it.

LABU and IBB are all takes on the same sector with different flavors

XBI is down 25% from highs and keeps crashing. some context :

**What usually drives $XBI ?**

* **M&A** Premiums, only $XLV big large cap healthcare companies can really put a $ price tag on XBI and recently we have been having Great volume.
* Interest rates, $XBI companies mostly never generate cash flow in the short term, it is a promise of future cash flows far in the future and only if the something within the pipeline crosses the FDA approval process. Just like the Nasdaq thus.
* Regulatory challenges

The suits have started shorting this thing because they think Papi Biden gonna screw the industry to 0. These greedy pigs accumulated a short interest of ABOVE 100%. A lot of them are just here on momentum let's face it.

**This whole short started because there were rumors about the viability of the AZN / ALEXION deal well guess what, the relevant reg bodies just approved it today. I think XBI should jump 10% on this news**

**I have a whole lot of theories as to why it didn't today but suffice to say it will likely happen next week.** 

Small pharma companies are the backbone of American innovation, without them there is no covid vaccine, there are no cures. Pfizer & Novartis haven't made shit in a while, they rely on these yolo ventures to fill the pipelines with new molecule ideas. it's bad to kill them like this.

TLDR : XBI 150 3 Months out. Long RTY in futures (which includes XBI)"

2021-04-16 21:02:19,wallstreetbets,Works great until the stock goes down and you gotta choose between risking a big loss or scraping pennies from selling OTM calls
2021-04-17 10:24:42,wallstreetbets,Imagine Monday it hits 600+
2021-04-17 02:11:35,wallstreetbets,"Not necessarily. Options are pretty complicated when you're brand new to them, but I'll try to explain it well.

A call option contract gives you the right, *but not the obligation*, to buy 100 shares at a given price for a premium per share. If the listed price for a contract *per share* is 5 dollars, the total cost of the contract will be $500 as you said. You are not signing up to pay $500 later, you are essentially paying $500 upfront to control 100 shares. Say the share price is currently $100 and you think it will be over $120 in a month. Normally you would need to pay $10,000 to buy them and then sell them later at $120 for a profit. In this case we've made, you only need $500.

Contracts have an expiration date. If the share price has risen beyond $120 as you predicted, you're doing well! But, you are still at a loss. You paid $500 to begin with. The price now needs to exceed your prediction for you to break even. Once it has, you are making money. However, if the stock does not meet your prediction, that money is 100% gone and the contract expires without any value.

At this point there are two things you can do. You can exercise the option, meaning that you are buying $12000+ worth of shares for $10000, essentially getting a discount. These shares are now yours and you can sell them immediately. Alternatively (and this is what most people do), you can sell the contract itself for its current value. You might consider it being like selling a coupon for the amount that it saves you."
2021-04-17 05:18:52,wallstreetbets,yea - since each contract consists of 100 shares
2021-04-17 07:29:02,wallstreetbets,Your broker will do the math for you before you confirm the trade

2021-04-17 16:56:45,wallstreetbets,This is why I don‚Äôt touch options.
2021-04-17 13:44:10,wallstreetbets,I noticed a huge uptick in premium prices and volumes on various tickers ever since the initial GME surge.
2021-04-16 20:17:00,wallstreetbets,Yeah I‚Äôm trying to build up enough capital to start wheeling GME. I never took profits when GME spiked huge the first time. If I would have taken profits I would have had more than enough to wheel a couple contracts. Live and learn ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

2021-04-17 18:51:51,wallstreetbets,How y‚Äôall feelin for my 200 calls this week?
2021-04-17 13:16:14,wallstreetbets,Listed price is always per share. You multiply that by 100 to figure out how much you pay for a given contract. If the option costs $1 you pay $100 to buy the contract which gives you the right to either buy or sell (call and put respectively) 100 shares at the strike price at anytime until the option expires.
2021-04-16 20:29:52,wallstreetbets,"I got in with 50 shares at $14 and paper handed it when it dropped to $12 and then didn't buy back in at $40..... 

my avg cost is currently $120 so if goes to shit I at least don't lose the full 12K I have. Also I can afford a deep OTM put to cover if it goes tits up so I at least am only out 1-2K."
2021-04-16 22:09:00,wallstreetbets,"Wait you sold a cover call were the break even was below your costs basis? fuck that is dumb.

The only way to lock in a loss and get assigned is if the stock is in the money and you sold something that was a auto lock. 

If you buy a stock near the top you have to make sure the option is going to expire above your cost basis or yea your kind of fucked."
2021-04-17 07:21:37,wallstreetbets,Why in tf would you sell an ITM option below your avg price
2021-04-16 20:35:24,wallstreetbets,"I owned 100 shares @13.18 and sold around 18. I never heard of wallstreetbets back then. Boy if I did, I would have been sitting pretty decent with those shares. Oh yeah... and I had 1000 shares of amc back then too at around 3.14 average. Fuck me right? Lol

**DESCRIPTION**

Charge Point is an electric infrastructure company that designs, develops & manufactures hardware & software solutions for electric vehicles at large. It offers a portfolio of hardware, software, & services for corporate, public, & residential customers. Company was founded in 2007 and operates in 14 countries.

**History**

In June 2017, $CHPT took over 9,800 electric vehicle charging spots from GE. Prior to that point, $CHPT managed 34,900 charging stations across Mexico, Australia, Canada, and the United States.

The current CEO and president as of 2018 is Pasquale Romano. On November 28, 2018, $CHPT raised $240 million. At the time, $CHPT maintained 57,000 charging spots. In 2019, VW's [Electrify America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrify_America) and $CHPT agreed to provide common access to their US customers. Company reached 100,000 chargers in September 2019, while adding more than 2,000 charging locations per month. Currently $CHPT offers 132k charging station network. Which accounts for 72% market share of total level 2 charging in North America. New entity was formed from Legacy Charge Point combined with Switchback late Feb 2021;

**What is the business model of CHPT?**

Charge Point sells hardware & software (equipment¬†& network subscriptions) to property owners. The company doesn't own the majority of stations. It doesn't monetize energy. It only monetizes the driver, thus capital light business model.

üì∑

$CHPT enjoys the [largest share](https://investors.chargepoint.com/why-invest/default.aspx) of Level 2 chargers in the US. Data from [AFDC](https://afdc.energy.gov/fuels/electricity_locations.html#/analyze?fuel=ELEC) shows that $CHPT wields the largest market share at 42.8K L2 chargers out of 92.8K total of which 11.5K are ""non-networked"", carving \~53% market share of ""networked"" chargers. No 2 competitor is Tesla with 16.8K, No3 largest, is SemaCharge Network at 5.2K, followed by Blink with 3.1k which is 4th. In terms of L3 'Superchargers', where Tesla leads the way with 10.7k of 19.6k units. $CHPT is competitive with 1.5k with only Electrify America coming in higher at 2.5k. Superchargers account for \~22% of the market pie, L2 \~75% and L1, \~3% of market share.¬†People keep reiterating that L3 is the future and no one should bother with L1 & L2. Well, that's wrong. L3 is obviously the option for the highways, commercial and service transportation. Even larger segment though is found at: parking lots, restaurants, cinemas, sports arenas, malls, corporate offices and other mass conglomerations. This is where L2 comes to play much cheaper than L3 to install, but with longer charging times - perfect fit.

**Products**

Comprehensive Hardware Portfolio Delivers - Solutions for every use case, all vehicle types and brands - High efficiency in power and footprint - Modular, scalable, secure architecture designed for serviceability- Unparalleled quality; advanced testing (vehicle, functional, climate, environment) for long-term reliability - Options for site hosts to use custom branding

**Software Enables** \- Control of who can use stations and when - All vehicles to get charged on time - Multiple vehicles to share power - Drivers to get in line when ports are occupied- Roaming integrations with other charging networks

**Challengers**

* $VLTA; Claims to go beyond just charging EVs, their chargers are used for ads and their charger placement is based on data analytics in collaboration with $PLTR. When company compares itself to the competition, they do it all - they own the gear, they sell the electricity, they provide software and networks, they do fancy data things, they do advertising. The things they don't do, are manufacture and sell the chargers. They cherry-pick a bunch of stats to show that their chargers have better ""engagement"" but given they only have 1.7k Level 2s & 6 L3. It's like chargers-as-billboards, selected to prime locations. *Anyone can replicate it, if it provides substantial revenue boost, competitors will emulate it*.
* SemmaConnect: Company boasts 3rd largest market share of L2 chargers. SemmaConnect also manufactures chargers and sell software. SemaConnect chargers are OCPP compliant. Sema appears not to have a L3 offering, nor do they appear to offer sales to individuals (single-family residential).
* $EVGO; EVgo claims to have made the first 150kW and 350kW L3 chargers, and base their business largely on L3 chargers. AFDC data says they only have 403 L2s but 1.4k L3 which garners 4th market share. Company also offers drivers a membership for reduced charging rates (\~0.04/min assuming you spend 7.99/month) and they have integrated Tesla connectors on their newer L3. EVgo also has a nationwide infrastructure roll-out deal with GM and are entirely powered by renewables. What differentiates the company is the L3 focus.
* $BLNK: Overhyped POP stock. Blink sells L2 and L3 chargers to business and individuals. Claims to operate on an owner/operator model. From EC:*""The Company made continued progress with its owner/operator strategy; the number of commercial Blink-owned charging stations contracted or deployed during the quarter grew by 51% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year period.""*
* $VWAGY Subsidiary:(Electrify America): L3 focused company, it enjoys 2.5k L3 chargers. EM also sells a L2 for the home. EM offers an app, membership for drivers with a monthly fee that gets you a good discount on their charging costs. The membership and cost to charge suggests that they own their chargers. EM also have an electric vehicle subscription service and have some relationships with Jeep and Hyundai. All its reports seem to be released to the California Air Resources Board. Company doesn't appear to build their own chargers, instead relying on procurement, using third-party hardware and software.

**Near Term Catalysts**

In relation to upcoming US government infrastructure bill: ""AlixPartners estimates $300 billion will be needed to build out a global charging network to accommodate the expected growth of EVs by 2030, including $50 billion in the U.S. alone.""

It's not too late to make bets on upcoming infrastructure bill. Yes you can dabble into construction firms and commodity plays, but you don't know which companies will win lucrative contracts and sizes of those contracts. Well the biggest companies you might say? It's not that clear cut. What is clear cut, is that the focal point of this infrastructure bill is transition to renewable energy and overhaul of pivotal infrastructure. $CHPT has the most experienced (14yrs) company with largest manufacturing capacity, technical know how and ability to take on large scale projects like, building hundreds of thousands of charging stations across all states (500k by 2030). Oh yeah one more thing, former $CHPT board member is in current administration.

That's only US. $CHPT operates infrastructure in the hub of world's renewable energy aka Europe. (Also, Canada, Australia, UK, Mexico among other places) You find yourself at the erection of the infrastructure that you and your kids will be utilizing down the road. Just like, railways, roads, telcoms and internet.

**Long Term Catalysts**

\- Fossil fuel bans - Transit electrification dates - Incentive programs - All major auto OEM brands committed to electric + Further EV cost reductions with advances in battery technology.

$CHPT Growth Directly Proportional to EV Penetration, $CHPT Estimated $1B Revenue at 3% EV Penetration.

**Miscellaneous**

$CHPT Apple Store rating: 4.6.

$CHPT also has the #1 bestselling home charging station on Amazon with hundreds of 5 star reviews.

$CHPT offers access to hundreds of thousands of places to charge with one account via proprietary app.

In collaborations with Daimler, Toyota, BMW, Siemens etc.

No1 choice for Fortune 500 companies. Customers include: Google, Target, IKEA, NASA, GM, Pepsico, Disney, McDonalds, FedEx, Stanford etc.

Shareholders lock up period ends on September 1st.

**MOAT**

* First Mover Advantage (With 14 years of experience in a nascent industry, this is where big contracts will go)
* Asset light business model ( Selective ownership of charge stations, outsources maintenance & responsibilities to the owner)
* Economies of Scale ( $CHPT has largest manufacturing capacity)
* Network Effect ( \~75% of charging network market share & operations in 14 countries)

**CONCLUSION**

All in all $CHPT stock is a pure EV exposure, with light CapEx business model. Company is the ecosystem player with defensible MOATs, recurring revenue streams and visibility. $CHPT finds itself in ESG friendly category and attracts premium valuation due to penetrance in multiple domains: EV Ecosystem (Hardware), Software Powered Solutions and Energy Technology.  Yes most of its network is L2 chargers, but it's where most of the money is to be made. As users go to restaurants, malls, sports events/concerts, office, cinema, universities or just a Parking Lot! There will be L2 charger not L3 due to: Charger Cost Basis/Time Parked. Pretty straightforward formula.

**Why am I interested in $CHPT?**

Because it's an entrenched leader with tremendous experience in a nascent industry.

Because it's a clever business model based on light assets which will subsequently offer high margins 5 years from now. And is literally replacement of GAS stations no matter what happens! And is a home ""GAS station"".

Because EVs are the future and I am catching the momentum and inevitable supremacy and prevalence of charging stations.

A small market cap in the market that will explode no matter what.

This is really well rounded company with superb fundamentals & \~13% institutional ownership, what's going to happen to the stock when institutions commence adoption of it? Let me use a technical term you''ll understand, the valuation will go - bananas.

Average target price $38.21"
2021-04-17 02:44:55,wallstreetbets,"Someone pointed out that even if chpt seems to be the leader in lv2 charging their whole business model is in no way the futur ‚Äùgas station‚Äù for EV, car owner rather charge au home at night for discount price than a charging station, and for long travel they Will probably use lv3 charger that are way faster from tesla or evgo"
2021-04-17 14:45:52,wallstreetbets,"I like chpt, the market seems to be going the other direction though in terms of ev/charging.. still I‚Äôd imagine it will rotate back to this sector soon enough."
2021-04-17 06:32:33,wallstreetbets,Yes but I think charging stations will be everywhere in the future and will be good business. Traveling and stopping to eat? EV station. Going out shopping? EV station. Staying at a hotel? EV station. Etc...

Puts are nothing more than pre-agreed sale prices. In order to exercise a put you have to buy shares first. If you sold the put you aren't entitled to any shares."
2021-04-17 19:01:44,wallstreetbets,"The guy you're replying to literally just did the math in front of you indicating OP could have had double the number of shares he does today, and you're like ""Maybe he believes in the stock""?

2021-04-17 19:04:51,wallstreetbets,That's pretty cheap as far as options courses go.
2021-04-16 21:57:36,wallstreetbets,"If you sell the contract do you only get a percentage of the value, if so what percentage?

Exercising = 3000$ initial cost, gets you $15500 in share value.

Selling the contract = ??? Do you just walk away with the profit of 12,500$ or is it some percentage less?

When you sell the contract what actually happens? Are you just selling the right to buy 100 shares @ 30 a share to someone else and they pay you 12500 to do so?"
2021-04-17 01:49:06,wallstreetbets,"Cool.

If you don't mind, let's say I buy a contract on ISRG when it drops to 750 next week. In the app I have (limited selection here in Denmark), I can pick 'Buy to open', quantity (1 which means 1 contract for 100?), expiry date, strike price and a price.

In the cost details I have a ""cost"" and ""premium"", that's what I pay now? If I put in let's say 985 as strike on 21/5, the app says cost: $3,03 and premium $10. That means I pay $13 now? And if it doesn't hit 985 by 21/5 all is lost and if it passes 985 I can either buy at $985  or sell the contract before expiry

Edit: Better numbers, let's say cost  $3.03 + premium: $105, current price $750, strike price: $790.

If by expiry it's 805 I can sell the contract and net 150 minus expenses making $42. If it's $780, I lose $108.03"
2021-04-16 21:52:05,wallstreetbets,you were still out of the money at close on that though right?
2021-04-17 18:20:43,wallstreetbets,If you have no idea what options are (and you clearly don't)  save your comment.   Jesus you guys really are retarded.   I'm wondering if the put will get exercised because I sold the put meaning the shares will be put to me.  A unique thing happened where the put became out of the money after the normal time in which a retail holder of the put would be forced to choose whether or not to exercise and put the shares to me at the agreed upon price of 160.
2021-04-17 01:08:45,wallstreetbets,Start safe. Sell covered calls. You'll start to understand pricing. Worst case scenario you'll sell your stocks for a price you already decided was ok. Best case is free money from premiums.
2021-04-17 18:45:07,wallstreetbets,Yah I had to stop after taking a 10k loss last month lmao
2021-04-16 22:48:22,wallstreetbets,When you sell you get the value of the contract which in this case would be the shares value above the strike. Because at expiration Delta goes to 1 so each dollar of stock value above the strike is worth 100. Before  expiration the value would be different  depending on the situation... Delta and time value would be in play.
2021-04-16 22:45:55,wallstreetbets,"Hahaha its all good!  We're all retarded here and I mean that in the nicest way.   Was well in the money at close,  think closing price was 154 something"
2021-04-17 18:30:10,wallstreetbets,"Which of these two points do you disagree with?

1. If a put is out of the money then there's no reason to exercise.
2. If a put is in the money, then this means that the current stock price is lower than the put value (it's opposite to in-the-money call options). The owner of the put can, if they have the money to buy 100 shares, buy the shares and choose to exercise the put, meaning that the original issuer of the put will be forced to buy 100 shares at the pre-agreed put value."
2021-04-16 22:11:02,wallstreetbets,"Got it. So selling the contract doesn't mean selling the contract to another person, it just means selling the shares on the contract and taking the profit as shown on the calls, in this case $12500.

Versus exercising and having 100 shares of GME with a value of $15500 but not physically have the money."
2021-04-17 18:52:55,wallstreetbets,I agree with both of those points.   As I've said multiple times the put was in the money at 5 eastern time and went out of the money after normal retail traders need to indicate whether or not they want to exercise.   Hence the question of whether or not the put will be exercised or if i should buy 100 shares premarket.
2021-04-17 02:00:57,wallstreetbets,hummmm I hope OP posts an update. ill be happy to see gains or loss.. but  i kinda want to see where it goes.

2021-04-17 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Marathon Oil - $MRO - Market Manipulation? Oil prices have been going up, but oil stocks have been dropping, some like MRO quite substantially. There doesn‚Äôt seem to be any reason for it, demand is increasing, production is steady, inventory is dropping, and economic data has been increasingly positive, with Covid downturns in Europe already priced in, and the US/travel beginning to open up.

While there are undoubtedly risks to oil itself dropping such as the OPEC+ production increases slated for may, it doesn‚Äôt make sense why oil prices would increase while oil stocks, which are almost solely dependent on oil prices, drop. 

I believe this coming week will see one of two things, a correction of crude oil prices themselves, or a massive gap up in oil stock prices.

A massive gap up to me makes more sense, as until may there are not many major sources of strife outside of a massive covid spike or rapid production increases from Russia/Iran (which is definitely possible but I don‚Äôt believe likely)

It seems that the prices may be pushed down in order to create a panic sell slide which would allow a better entry for larger positions for institutional investors. 

I‚Äôve also seen several ‚Äúprepaid forward contracts‚Äù vehicles that went into effect this week from Citigroup and UBS listing MRO as one of the underlying stocks, I‚Äôm wondering if they are driving prices down to hedge their bets so they could be in a better position when the interest payments for these contracts come around. Using the initial funds generated by the contracts to purchase cheaper shares and simply pay out comparatively smaller interest on them to their customers. They make money from the purchase of these forward contracts initially, and they make more from the purchase of cheaper shares that they are pocketing, rather than those who purchase the contracts.

For reference the Citigroup contract has three underlying assets: MRO, WYNN, and BA. All of which have dropped 1.5% or more this week despite better outlooks economically. 

The Citigroup filing is below, this is obviously all speculative, and I‚Äôm not trying to sound conspiratorial, but I truly don‚Äôt know what else it could be, what do you think?

2021-04-16 20:16:06,wallstreetbets,What you're supposed to do is keep trimming as the price goes up but keep your stop loss at break even after your first trim.
2021-04-16 20:21:55,wallstreetbets,That's assuming the price goes up after you buy it instead of down. And market stop losses with options will most likely lose you money if it's at the price you bought it.
2021-04-16 20:26:22,wallstreetbets,"Well it depends on what type of trading you're doing. The strat i mentioned is the best for day trades. However, its also decent for other trades as well. If you get stopped out then that means more often that not, you'll be able to buy back in at a lower price anyways unless you get extremely unlucky. Lets say you buy a leap for $30. Now lets say you put a stop loss at $26 and it gets triggered. A few days later its trading at $23. You just saved yourself $300 of losses and can buy back in if you want now at a lower price. What most people cant overcome when they trade is that when the price drops, you've already lost the money. If you bought a stock at $30 and its trading at $20 now, you've already lost $10."

Let me start with I am not a financial adviser, I am just a lowly engineer who likes numbers.

**MRNA**

Projected sales for 2021 $18 billion (from MRNA last Quarter)

Projected doses sold in 2021 600 million to 1 billion

Price per dose $32-$38 per dose depending on how many you buy.

Just using these numbers MRNA will gross $19 billon to $38 billion.  This gives us an EPS of $46-$96.  At its current price the P/E ratio would only be 1.5-3.5!!  I know I am not figuring in costs but they cant be that bad.  I would guess $2-3 billion to ramp up production?

Moderna reports earnings on the 5th of May, I expect this to be a total blowout from what I can see above.

So why is the price so low still?  I am guessing that the fear of something going wrong with the vaccine  is still priced in.  If something goes wrong it would be catastrophic but so far so good!  I have yet to see any zombie reports...

**Why I am investing heavily in MRNA:**

\-I believe in the company.  I am double vaccinated with Moderna and everyone I know that had it had very mild side effects.

\-I believe in the science of what they are doing with messenger RNA.

\-Booster shot sales in the future?  AIDS vaccine?  CURE FOR CANCER??

Am I missing something here?  Please let me know what you guys think."

2021-04-17 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"MSOS YOLO and DD - Why I'm betting on next week to change the game for cannabis in the United States # Trying to be the Prophet of Profit

There's been a great deal of talk, trading and speculation about the cannabis sector in the past few years. Over the past few years and more interestingly few months we're seeing a staggering increase in legalization of recreational cannabis in the united states at the state level.

More importantly keeping a close eye on the activity of the Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer there is a continuous promise of reform legislation being introduced ""soon"". Soon is a dangerous word and this is an invitation to time the market.

Normally don't ever try to time the market like this. I'm a big believer in leaps on principle. From a few key data points being vast increase in legalization legislation at the state level and the echoes from Schumer's twitter feed about the very soon incoming reform legislation I'm finally ready to make my bet.

If you've kept up on the posts of my sub(I will not mention the name of my sub because that's not the point. I just needed a place where I knew my posts would NOT BE REMOVED.) you'll see I'm pretty consistent about watching Schumer's moves and also the new state legislation. All the news is good news. I want to cover one data point that I haven't really mentioned in the past. Schumer in 2018 introduced the MORE act. It obviously didn't go anywhere with McConnel running the senate but this is a very different situation. It is my firm belief that Schumer will actually do what he says he's going to do. The interesting data point about MORE act in 2018 was that it was introduced on the most meme date: April 20th.

I think Schumer is going to be apart of the meme and reintroduce legislation on this day next week. I also expect to see more robust edition of the legislation that handles many of the concerns of both the right and the left with regards to gracefully transitioning to a legal cannabis market.

Schumer Wyden and Booker worked together to build something so I am concluding that it's extensive, robust and addresses concerns around the war on drugs and the effects on POC in the United States.

There are some concerns around risk of the vote passing and avoiding it going nowhere due to filibuster. After doing research on the senators on the right wing and also watching unexpected support for the SAFE act I am now convinced that the legislation will be passed in the Senate this year.

I have covered every concern I've had about cannabis in my past posts be it on my sub largely or on r/wallstreetbets. If you want to see some of my DD go look for it. I'm not cross posting or linking them.

# My Expectations

I expect the announcement on the 20th next week and a sharp price movement upward. The following day there may be a selloff as there are always scalpers to shake out the FOMO buyers. I expect the price to either stagnate or slowly rise until the legislation ultimately pass and then a sharp selloff of 10-20%. This will be the day traders / short term traders exiting for profit.

I think it's fair to expect at least a 25% increase in the price of MSOs and relevant ETFs that carry those holdings. (MSOS and some yolo holdings). Yes I'm speculating and no that isn't a math-derived number. MSOS currently sits at $40. It has taken hits over the past few months as pretty much the whole market.

I think the whole sector will jump but ultimately non multi state operators will see a brutal selloff depending on what's in the bill. My expectation with the legislation is that MSOs and smaller competitors will be the greatest beneficiaries. POC and people who want to enter the sector on a small retail end will be considered in the bill as they historically were a target of the war on drugs and will likely see special consideration in the bill.

Why?

Licensing isn't going away. This bill will not make a 'wild-west' scenario where anyone can enter the market. Licenses aren't free and aren't unlimited. Each state will control who has a license to interact in the sector. This isn't new and I'd be completely shocked to see any reversal of this trend. More so the states are ultimately going to be in control of all of the rules give or take a few federal stipulations.

# My Bet

If you've followed my posts you'll see I'm already very long on MSOS and the industry as a whole. I will get calls for either May or June and hold them for a bit. I will before the final vote is taken get some puts. I expect the sell off so I expect to ride it up by entering calls before announcement of the legislation and getting puts before the vote as I expect a selloff. This will also help me insulate my self from some of the risk of holding a completely one sided position.

I simply don't have enough money to exercise all of the calls I can buy so I will be selling a large portion of the short term ones after announcement. The strike on my long calls will be around c50 or c55.

# In short my play

* Buy calls before week ending 4/16 (expiry either May or June depending on risk and price)
* Sell calls after 4/20
* Buy puts before the final vote is taken in congress
* Close puts after vote confirms legalization
* Buy shares with any profits I've made

Here's my current positions as I don't know exactly when I'll enter my new calls. obviously I'm doing it today.

I have to warn you, apester, this is a super duper long read and it will take a considerable amount of your time as well as about 140% (several estimations state that the percentage might even be as high as 420-696.9%) of brain resources. However, it is completely worth it to read it in full, I promise you - ap~~e~~ transcendence is imminent upon completing the reading. Also, do it for the love to memes, because I genuinely handcrafted about 15 memes and put it here for your satisfaction.

My fundamental idea behind this colossal, voluminous piece of work was to build a framework for myself (and other interested apes), as to be aware of where it all stands now, how it all got here, and the likely outcomes of this spectacular show you have all been observing and participating in. Furthermore, I tried my best to make the language as simple as possible, using **ELIA**s (**E**explain **L**ike **I**'m an **A**pe) where possible, and doing my best in elaborating on difficult financial concepts and terms for this intellectually limited individuals with extraordinary small brain capacity that you all are. This work is structured in such a way so that even with zero knowledge in the subject, you will be able to grasp all of the important concepts from the first go. It is especially important for the newcomers of this sub, influx of whom might happen, should any major potential catalyst unwhale. So, do not hesitate to share this even with 1/10 brain-wrinkled individuums.

The story addressed is as old as this world, and it involves greed, manipulation, exploitation, corruption and decay; as well as unity, bravery (abreast retardation), optimism, support and and creative forces. The eternal battle of good and evil, no matter how corny it sounds. Compulsory buckle up and eat a crayon apefriend, that's going to be a ride!

# Chapter I. The Short, the Squeeze and the Ugly

The story begins with a hedge fund (HF from here on), and there is really nothing particular about this HF. For general understanding of an ape that knows nothing: ""A **hedge** **fund** is an investment partnership - the marriage of a fund manager and investors who pool their money together into the fund, with the objective of earning active return."" - The **game** is that simple, thanks, Inve **stop** edia, you are always spot on! The HF might have been named by whichever name exists, it really does not matter for history. What is actually important, is the setting in which it operated, and the rules, according to which this HF played (and also exploited). In this particular case, the antagonist is called Melvin Capital Management LP (MC thereafter). However, I would encourage you not to get attached to names; but instead view the antagonist as a collective image, as an intrusive parasite, which appears as soon as a suitable environment exists for that. And where there is one parasite, there will come many.

&#x200B;

**""ButT wat did di Hedgehogs do so that ther is sO mutch indiEgnation boUt t?""**

You are asking the right questions here, my little ape-man fellow. Only the lazy haven't scolded the HF, and as a matter of fact there are solid grounds to do so. Briefly, the antagonists exploited the loophole (do not confuse with the loop hole in your head, apemeister) in the short selling mechanism, which effectively allowed them to severely manipulate the market for their benefit. Furthermore, the bad guys have been doing that for years and even decades. GME is a very indicative, even whistleblowing example of the wrongdoing being done. All of these issues will be **D**ug **D**eeper into and discussed in detail further on, but let me start from the basics for half-wrinkled beginner apes to catch up with us, one whole wrinkle elitists.

**SHORT SELLING ELIA.** You are a smart entrepreneurial ape, and you obtained the information that led you to believe that the banana market will be aplenty this year (banana harvest go BBBRRRRR) and as a result the prices will drop significantly. The ape progress is so advanced, that you are able to enter a contractual relationship with another apedividual. This guy is known to have a big bulk of bananas just laying around, so you use this opportunity to borrow those for a period of time and agree to give those back later with the premium. The other ape sees you as a credible partner (understandable, as you went to Apeuke University and received MBA there - Master of Banana Appreciation degree)  thus lending you 100 bananas for one ape dollar each. You then rush to the local ape banana market 'ooh ooh ahh ahh'-ing all the way in great cheer for what a businessape apemomma raised. You sell the goods for $100 and wait. Because your due diligence was apegod-tier, the plan worked and one banana now costs 0.5 ape dollars. You then buy 100 banananas back from the market for $50 and give it back to the apelender, as well as a small premium agreed upon previously. ???? **PROFIT!!!!** (of about 50 bucks)

https://preview.redd.it/x0hwq95cujt61.png?width=503&format=png&auto=webp&s=353e830d77c215761c0b595610eac2e2e98a9c65

However, the example above only illustrates the perfect world, where all apes are honest apes and the ape market does not have inefficiencies. The current problem with short selling is that at one moment GME had the highest percentage of float shorted in the world, amounting to about 140% (and by many it is considered to be a rookie number, even currently). Yes, it does mean that more shares were sold short than shares existed. It is a big issue, let's discuss it in detail. One important point before we dive deeper, though. Lately I saw many honorable 'traders' ( ' ' marks mean that the word is used as an anagram) in comments criticizing the short mechanism as a whole, viewing it negatively and in some extreme examples even advocating the prohibition of it. And even though,

https://preview.redd.it/xt8bt34hujt61.png?width=488&format=png&auto=webp&s=e6506e88f0d417c5c62cde5ba20cd2c7ac39b170

, at this point it is important to mention that short selling is an integral part of the markets for a variety of reasons. In addition to creating liquidity to help make a market, short selling allows people to benefit from a stock price going down (as explained in the bananas ELIA above) leveling the playing field for those looking to make all types of investments. Short selling is an essential component of market stability (as long as it is not exploited, surely): hence sometimes longs are blinded by euphoria and optimism and there‚Äôs no one to hold these companies' feet to the fire, short sellers look at companies with a bit more of a critical eye than the average investor. Ooh, I'm starting to sound like a üåàüêª, so forgive me permabullapes, as I have sinned, forgetting and ignoring the only autistic postulate to live by here, and that is: ""STONKS ONLY GO UP"".

&#x200B;

**""k Shortz IMPOrTENT but hoW iZ 140% bananana sell? Ape iNfinit maniy go BrrrRrr?""**

Yeah, you caught it right, smoothie-brainie. The main components to that are so-called IOUs, settlement cycles, leverage, excessive borrowing, failures to deliver, and, most importantly:

https://preview.redd.it/rgbvoyrlujt61.png?width=488&format=png&auto=webp&s=00239d43b35be1f158734b19e14fedb4be05bcf2

I am sorry that your head exploded after looking at the words aforementioned above, I really am! But this is how the evolution works, and you just fell victim to it. Nevermind, just collect the shattered pieces of your brain (about two grams, should not take long), put it back into the empty vessel that your head is, and fix it with some duct tape, I dunno. Jokes aside, let's continue, and now I will explain the cornerstone concepts of IOU obligations (abbreviation of I Owe You) as well as FTDs (failures to deliver), as these will be prevalent through the entire discussion. Starting from the basics first:

**IOUs ELIA**. Your ape grandma lived a busy life and she has a lot of ape-dollars as her savings. She heard about the banana price increase hype as everyone's been talking about it, so she decided to buy some for her own. Luckily, there is a decent broker called Bananality, and because she feels like really shaking the old days, she YOLOs all her savings into the bananas of BanaNonStop Corp. So far so good? üêª with me. As soon as apema pays for the banana stock, the money and the bananas have to change hands, and this is called 'settlement'. In many ape countries money and bananas change hands two days after the trade, and that is called 'T+2'. Ideally, this processes have to take place simultaneously. But in the current ape financial system bananas are divorced from money, thus her money may settle independently of  bananas settlement. Before the trade settles, ape grandma will be holding banana IOUs on her account, and importantly these are IOUs for BANANAS, not for money. Furthermore, the system sees her IOUs as normal stock bananas. In the perfect ape world, the blockage does clear up after T+2, and Bananality is able to send the banana stock through the system hence the IOUs are wiped out.

**Failures to Deliver (FTDs) ELIA**. Now let's imagine that apema was not so lucky in choosing her broker and ran into a crook, who wants to deliberately exploit the system of settlement and the broker is called Bananaked. The grandma enters the trade, the money settles, however, something blocks Bananaked from settling its shares through the system. And this something is nothing but a malicious intent, as all the the broker did was issuing banana IOU's with no real intention of covering it according to the rules. It might even be the case, that Bananaked never held those shares which he sold. If at the moment of T+2 settlement the IOUs are not covered by the banana stocks, it creates a deliberate, strategic failure to deliver. FTDs will be involved in the discussion later on, as these are the main vehicles through which the loophole is exploited (still, not as bad as your hole is exploited, though). Well, fuck you, Bananaked, the day will come and you will be dealt with for messing up with apema, mark my ape word!

Puts on your brain then. Just eat a banana, or a Crayon, you will be fine... Allrighty, you convinced me. Lets dive out of theory and discuss GAMEEESTOOOOP, finally! We will jump back to the concepts elaborated upon above as soon as the context is necessary for that. Here, Wen Moon got your back and he will cheer you up for your dedication to reading!

[\\""Camon ape ya can do it, read and evolve!\\"" - Wen Moon.](https://preview.redd.it/cboe9744vjt61.jpg?width=1059&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cffb0db75e9a238bd26bb7d36b2b78b509be34ec)

**""oKay i candO yit, fUkc mah braIn wit moore nowledge mtfakeRr!""** \- an ape.

That's the approach I needed. Remember about antagonistic MC? No, not the one who performed at your ape party last weekend and did it pretty bad. I'm talking about Melvin Capital. So, the main story line begins in 2014, the year when MC started to short the stock that I like very, very much. Gabe Plotkin, MC manager stated that fact proudly himself, during the first Congressional Hearing. There were several big fundamental reasons to bet on GME decline at that time, among which: company's debts and financial position, digitalization of the gaming industry, consoles sales \[big part of the revenue\] super-cycle moving away from its apex (and later on, the pandemic happened, which added dramatically to the negative sentiment). Let's take a look at the chart of GME:

[GME Monthly Chart, 2014-2019 highlighted](https://preview.redd.it/fr7lat7kvjt61.png?width=2129&format=png&auto=webp&s=b93e9ba2885b5093a8687aa249fdb2dce0bc5676)

As you may see, the chart covers a relatively long period of time, and the big red REKTangle here highlights the fat and nasty, steady downward trend. From the current outlook on things, it is obvious that MC made a correct financial decision, shorting the stock from its highs of about $45 a share, all the way down to about 3-6 dollars per share diapason starting in the middle of 2019. That is a whooping gain of more than ninety(90)!!! %, or more than forty dollars per share gain! Impressive numbers, aren't they? Yeah, you won: you were right betting against the company; you've made shit tons of money; your wife's boyfriend accepted your dominance as an alpha 'trader' (anagram) ape and voluntarily left the family, now FIX YOUR FUCKING PROFITS AND CLOSE YOUR POSITION! Why did the shorters not cover when they had a perfect opportunity window for that LASTING FOR MORE THAN A FUCKING YEAR? Because of the bankruptcy jackpot.

As it was explained previously short selling is an important market instrument and it may deliver net decent profits for investors who thoroughly calibrate the risk; the 'bankruptcy jackpot' is a relatively uncommon situation which promises a much larger pay off should it occur. And it is an extremely risky bet, the one that only the epic 'traders' are willing to undertake (so, to some extent it is possible to say, that MC belongs to WSB). The HFs were driven by the fact, that in the event of insolvency, any collateral provided to back up the shorted shares has to be returned to the short seller. Furthermore, as it is no longer necessary to return the shares shorted, the shortist takes it all, the whole profit. As soon as the it became obvious for HFs that the copany should soon go buncrupt, the MHFs decided to 'help' Gamestop and invoked their dirty trick of naked short selling to the full power (the mechanism is discussed below). Before the Ryan Cohen updates, the consensus and the market sentiment on the greatest stock of all time was severely grim. So, why not go all in if you had already won it all (HF reasoning)?

They dared to YOLO, 140% or more type of YOLO...

And soon the shitshow of an unimaginable scale begins to uncover itself. But before that...

&#x200B;

**""WatT hapenT nExt telL meh rn ya cheeKY wahnKerR!1? How dit dey YOYO?""**

Everything has its time, young padawan, don't hurry. The second half of 2020 brought several substantial catalysts for the dramatic shift of GME consensus towards being positive, accordingly, pushing the price of the stock to the upside. And to a great extent it has to be attributed to one fellow, and you all know his name. Yes, apeladies and gentleapes, this is your hero and savior, <in Leeroy's Jenkins voice> RYYYYYAAAAANN COOOOHEEEN. If by now you do not know this guy, then you can't really call yourself an ape, things don't work like that here, go and duckduckgo him or something!

By buying a big stake of GME \[12.91% currently\], RC (and his Ventures) brought a lot of attention to the company, giving the market sentiment a powerful bullish impulse, and then accelerating it even further by getting deeper involved into the business operation and the development of GameStop. At this point, it is fair to say, that many of the pioneering bulls were jumping into the market buying rumors.

[Many, but not u\/DeepFuckingValue of course. This guy is out of this world.](https://preview.redd.it/v7m84mkqwjt61.png?width=486&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5bbbf5afcba1ec73751912ce860f7bc397ee640)

It is with the new updates that were being poured out of the bucket, the investors, ‚Äòtraders‚Äô and general market participants found out that: GameStop is underway towards its digital transformation (online sales increased in 300% Q3 2020); internal restructuring bound to the new growth strategy, resulting in CFO replacement; new consoles supercycle starting with PS5 and XBox Series X/S releases (historically very strong periods for *GME*), and many, many more under the hood developments of which we are not even aware of, or only start to find out about (just type the word 'delivery' into the search of a friendly *sub*). To conclude on that point:

https://preview.redd.it/bm94jyf0xjt61.png?width=468&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ec245cad38eb6d05c47ee5d168e5e498c45840a

When a general market sentiment changes from negative to positive, it is usually a bad idea to bet against it. Even WSB 'traders' understand this fundamental principle (correct me if I'm wrong), and this is where you, honorable 'Trader' with capital later, started to outplay the 'Big Guys'. Literally, the  üåàüêª HFs fell victim to their own relentless greed and stupidity, forgetting the golden trading rule that the trend is your friend until the end, and they did it spectacularly. Furthermore, instead of closing the positions and cutting the losses, they kept YOLOing and shorted more and more, in an attempt to suppress the buying pressure. And literally, now all that it takes you to show an awesome 'tradering' performance this year, is to buy, and hold.

&#x200B;

**""Okeh ape undeErstant now GEEmeEe go BBRRRRR. How about shorts, though?""**

Dafaq, you are evolving ape, look at how you are able to communicate! That's one whole correctly structured question with no 'TrAdEratIon'. Keep it up! And yeah, what about shorts? Briefly:  


# shortz r fuk

&#x200B;

**Short Squeeze ELIA**. Finally, it is time to discuss the most juicy squeezey piece of the puzzle. Let's refer to the short selling ELIA now. Remember how the businessape from the first ELIA happily brought the bananas to the ape market and in anticipation of the prices falling, sold his borrowed banana stock. Now, imagine that the forecast was not justified, and the things went according to the worst scenario possible: the banana harvest was poor and these became scarce; having bananas is now fashionable, and every ape wants to put their hands on what's hot; poor harvest, but because of abundant sunlight the bananas left are very delicious, so apes are ready to fight for putting it in their mouths... and etc. The businessape rushes around, panicking, begging for bananas, but these are nowhere to be found, because apemeisters hodl precious with their diamond ape hands; or, are only willing to sell 1-2 bananas for a ridiculous price of 500.000-1.000.000 ape dollars. The businessape now understands how screwed he is. He also recalls that the ape-guy he borrowed bananas from is an apemafiozi with a very bad reputation, because of punishing his failed debtors by putting LARGE bananas into their ANALysis. Fiasco, isn't it? The businessape now has nothing left to do, but to buy the banans back with any price available. Fortunately, the fortune he earned through decades of successful business is sufficient for covering his debts. And if not, you better recapitalize, ape pal, before bananas play a cruel joke on your ANALysis.

Apemeister! Don't hesitate to pause the reading and eat a Crayon if you need to. I know, that's a lot to digest, so take a proper care of your brain, currently working on 69420% of its capacity. Ready? Finally, this is the part where everything discussed above converges to one point. Quick ape recap: market sentimet bad, GME shortz short go BBBRRRR, Ryan Cohen buys GME to make it likable, market sentiment good, shortz r fuk, GME go BBBRRRR.

Oh, I see you are coming back to your natural state of an ape 'trader' again. I started to worry about you evolving too fast, now we're back to normal. üêª with me, this is the most interesting part.

https://preview.redd.it/gnxvi3bgxjt61.png?width=487&format=png&auto=webp&s=86b3a89e5c245e5ba1a22fb09df4ac9cbb120dd7

Remember IOUs, FTDs, HFs' YOLO 140% SI? Pepperidge apes remember. Ok, so, basicly short interest is a number that indicates the proportion of the shares in circulation (also called a float) sold short. Based on the businessape example, it would mean that he borrowed 100 out of 100 bananas available to being borrowed, went to the ape market and sold 140 bananas. Dafaq? How is that even possible? This is a complicated process, which I aim to discuss with a very in-**D**epth **D**ive, but in a separate post, Chapter II (as this post is voluminous enough already), alongside with dark pools, payment for order flow, sales restrictions, and other fuckeries for that matter.

For now, take a look at the following, and refer back to IOUs and FTDs ELIAs if necessary. According to T+2 settelment, the share has to be setteled no letter than two working days after the trade has been made. Before the settlement, what you hold on your 'tradering' account is an obligation for this share that you just bought - IOU. On a properly functioning market and not being exploited, T+2 has its positive effects too, providing additional liquidity to the system. However, when we talk about short selling, its effects can be destructive. Particularly, the loophole is used as an instrument to leverage the short position, without providing the adequate collateral in the short selling process which has to be, well you guessed, a share! And this process is being made three times cheaper for big players, as market makers operate based on T+6 settlement rule. That is to say, T+X makes it possible to back up your short position and create additional, artificial selling pressure by using IOUs which, in the nature of this mechanism, work as counterfeit collateral, and in its essence being nothing but

https://preview.redd.it/05e17wklxjt61.png?width=485&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b19d340a5a2d1f6ebd7af4da14cc9e953fad2ae

Furthermore, if you overuse or even overabuse this mechanism (to 140% and more), you may find yourself in a very unfortunate situation, similarly, to the one that MC and shorters found themselves in. Literally, by repeating this process over and over again, they put themselves into the trap, resulting in an inability to cover the excessive amount of shares borrowed, breeding FTDs in an futile attempt to fight the buying pressure. The key point to be made here is that it is often more profitable for big market participants to pay a fine, rather than letting the FTD game get loose, because the rules and laws in this area are not strict enough. Then, when nobody looks at the problem, well, the problem goes away. –°ounterfeit IOUs morphing into FTDs allow shorters to manipulate the market by artificially decomposing the buying pressure, but as it is a double edged sword - there is a high chance that the accumulated compression will fucking blow in your face at the inevitable moment. Once, ONCE in the history of 'traderation', the 'BIG MONEY' YOLOd against you, respectable 'trader', and they fucking lost spectacularly. When it is obious for everybody that you lost, it is probably a good idea to cut your loses and close the positions. Can you see the beauty of their YOLO? It is almoast as good as GUH (if you don't know what it means, YT it urgently - GUH WSB!). The artificial selling pressure that is accumulating into a ticking atomic bomb is just crazy, and oh boy, would I not want to be on that side of the trade now, getting my ass torn apart by this blast, as soon as it is no longer possible to constrain it.

Furthermore, and most importantly, if they can use these pesky techniques now, how do you know that they did not use that in 2014, when the initail GME mega downtrand was born? With the media being used as a manipulation instrument currently, it might have also been used as a tool to formulate the negative outlook on Gamestop starting from 2014 too... That is just crazy and mindblowing, isn't it?

More than that, many new fuckeries were revealed: RobbingHood trade restrictions, cheating with ETF's and calls, short attacks, you know the list. This is utterly unfair, so the only available option for me in this delicate situation everybody found themselves in, was to buy and hold, because I like the stock. The end. Or is it?

**TL; DR:**

2021-04-16 21:20:40,wallstreetbets,Right - that's how selling covered calls works. I do it on a bunch of stocks. You're betting against a massive spike in price within the time before expiration.

2021-04-16 20:39:33,wallstreetbets,i do options because I remember how tax they were when I wanted to buy more around $450. besides options are the only way to leverage on game without broker autoliq risk. and the main reason for me personally is if you buy enough of the right ones you can start a path to a whaleass position like dfv
2021-04-17 19:45:02,wallstreetbets,Yes. Never go full retard.
2021-04-17 05:09:43,wallstreetbets,"Buying short-term (weekly) options is a fools' game right now, IMO. With IV so high, options become really expensive. It's also a fact that 80% of all options expire out of the money (just like it's a fact that 90% of all startups will fail. Only the brave / foolhardy will have the hubris to think they're the ""special"" 10% that won't fail).

If you want to establish a long position in GME, you might wanna consider selling puts. That way you make money instantly. And then if it expires ITM, you buy the shares at the strike price, which presumably you were comfortable with anyway.

$150puts were selling at $10 earlier this week (ie $1000 per contract), so I myself sold a few."

2021-04-16 20:25:34,wallstreetbets,Probably because I have a very memorable pfp and profile name. Also because I've been stuck at the dmv for the last 5 hours and was on reddit the whole time.
2021-04-17 00:08:01,wallstreetbets,"Just cause there‚Äôs a lot of hate flowing around the DDs lately and DD with actual real info to make decisions on is appreciated. 

here‚Äôs my experience with his DDs. 
I‚Äôm not an ape, and never go full retard with my positions. 

But with my fun money account, I will shadow-ish trade & play the pre-operation mall based retailer for free tendies. (Nrdrage get back in for fun plz; you were in the other one with the big screens and they act literally the same)

Info in regards to previous DDs:

1. Cruises - I missed the boat and didn‚Äôt believe at first. Should have since they continued to run. 

2. Semiconductor play: $NXPI was before S&P announcement I think. Would have paid big if so. I joined late when $ON was $39 with $41 June strikes. It hit $43 a week after. Fast 100%. 

3. $BE, took 10% down on entry (late) avg‚Äôd down. Only at -3% today. Sector is beaten up can‚Äôt really blame him. 

4. $CLNE, late entry, not doing any worse then FCEL (i hate that i own it from chasing IV theta) / Sector or plug gang. Currently 10% down, but at one point it was 10% up. 

5. $CAT on a dip -> bounces right back to $230. $250 June calls were up 20% week after post. It‚Äôs now -20% since I didn‚Äôt take gains. I‚Äôll avg down if it hits 220. Still has time for Biden‚Äôs plan to be officially approved and priced in. 

6. $RYCEY: basically flat. Not big enough to cry about. 

7. $NVTA: I hate biotech. I took nibbles. First week up 5%. Has early morning scalp opportunities that I missed and his down -20%. I avg‚Äôd down. Only -5% now. (I went shares & options here since I hate bio). Should have bought $NVDA instead like the guy who couldn‚Äôt read. Would be up 500%+ on those if purchased that week. 

6. $NEE. This one is GOLDEN. Up 100% on my first call. Bought more options and averaged up. Up 60% this week on the new options. June $80, $85. 

7. $BB. I was in before it was a meme. Made money on the spike and will get back in now at $8-$9 with $20 leaps for 2023 because ceos never miss their targets. (Unless they are the soon to be former ceo of a game store)

Overall good info weekly. Shadow trade with caution, average in, and don‚Äôt buy at the peak and it‚Äôs been consistent wins. 

I probably won‚Äôt play this one cause the PUTs don‚Äôt have enough volume. Kind of like $DASH puts. Just waiting for that to hit near $200 again so their stupid salad robots can make me some green."
2021-04-16 20:56:17,wallstreetbets,"I did a little bit of DD on this guy's post history. 5 out of the last 8 'Friday DD' he wrote, you would've lost money. And if you would've followed the FD's route, you would've died. Maybe his plays really are good in the long term, idk, but short term his DD is no better than flipping a coin. His plays are at the whim of the overall market as every other retailer.

Everyone's a genius during a bull market. I'm not trying to diss him, I'm just hoping others realize that.

2021-04-16 20:26:03,wallstreetbets,"Nice suggestion, didn't know about them. Checked out the website and a video presentation of 2020. Apparently they know quite well what the issues are; the guy presenting certainly knows what he is talking about.

For me, there still appear to be some issues though; only two arms, so you still need extra incisions for auxiliary instruments, the camera looks quite fragile, and the changing of instruments / cleaning of the camera look like they could pose problems in terms of fragility / time consumption. Also VR for the surgeon instead of a classic console, hmm. VR can be quite nausea-inducing, and I say this as a gamer for over 30 years who owns 2 VR systems at home. You don't want to have this on a 3 or 4 hour procedure. But yeah sure, maybe for shorter procedures, this could be a nice in-between between classic laparoscopy and the 'overkill' of a Da Vinci. Still, as a hospital manager, you would have to choose (I don't see a lot of hospitals buying TWO different systems) so I would still prefer the gold standard of the Da Vinci. It depends on the price and budget I suppose.

Also haven't seen them in the field. I can ask around with my colleagues and while it does look promising, at this point I 'm afraid it is still only that, a promise. This seems to be a bit typcial lately with these SPACS. Personally I 'm not doing it until I hear more about them in practice, but will keep an eye out for it.

Edit: I found a presentation with their timeline, it will be years from now untill it is even applicable for practical use. I don't believe they will be able to make up for the headstart that Intuitive has. So for me it is a no. Only hope IMO maybe to make some money off it as a retail investor would be to sell the hype, or maybe if Intuitive bought them up for a nice price..."
2021-04-16 21:09:18,wallstreetbets,"Yet most of us here have made a ton of money off his calls. Just for kicks and giggles I looked at his last 8.  In order:

1:  $NEE has made me 50%.  Won money

2:  $NVTA:  I'm down like 5%, but this is why he told me to buy leaps I think and he warned in his DD that it was volatile

3:  $RYCEY: I didn't buy into that, but it's about flat and he said that you had to tuck it away and wait for them to have their chance at the recovery table

4:  $BE:  I made some money, took profits, and am down on the 2nd attempt but every green energy stock out there has been getting killed so that's hardly a knock on him.

5:  $CLNE:  I made like 300% the first time after he posted it and I'm basically even the 2nd time even though it's been getting beat up lately like every other green energy stock

6:  $ON was a 500% win for me. On that same vein, I made over $40,000 on a small handful of Nvidia 545 June calls he said to buy

7:  $NCLH and $CCL both have made me 500% total and I've played them 3 times each now following his guidance as to where their resistance and support is

8:  $BB:  He flat out says to tuck it away and don't look at it for 2 years

&#x200B;

If that's losing money I'll take it. And he basically never says do FD's. The biggest thing he has taught me is to not hold options to the end, so I'm constantly taking profits instead of just hoping the green number gets bigger and bigger every day, and to buy them far enough out that if they go really red it's not the end of the world. I was losing money almost every time I played options before. I've already made more than any year in my life this year and it's only April"

It‚Äôs a roadmap to the author‚Äôs shiny, tendie-laden destination, but you also need to look for good entry points. I‚Äôm still 100% on board for CLNE, but had I been patient and waited until today to buy my 6/18 13c I would be in a much better situation. It hasn‚Äôt taken me long to realize that the road to riches isn‚Äôt paved with FDs."
2021-04-16 23:28:47,wallstreetbets,"\^100% this. He only posts one these things on Fridays. And with the size positions he has by the time he posts them he's usually been in the trades for weeks because it takes him a long time to even get positioned. it's not like he's saying it's the perfect entry point the minute you read it or he just bought 5 minutes before he posted. His DDs aren't about squeezes or imaginary cup and handle patterns or something that is expected to happen the next day but more about slow burns. He does that in daily comments and you have to refresh his user page to see them. Just today he told everybody to buy May puts for $9 on Chamath's fake health company when it was at like 10.01 and if you followed him, you got in at like 3 cents from the top and he walked everyone through holding it until the trade was about over and made some comment about holding for something like 18 more cents down and then selling. Worked perfectly, made 20% gains in like 20 minutes and the stock only went down like 4 more cents from where he said it would and then it bounced back up. The DD's aren't for nailing a trade in a week or even a month that's why he's always saying buy more expensive contracts months out."

2021-04-16 21:17:29,wallstreetbets,"They're still lucrative, even if it moons. The only time you really lose with them is if the stock goes up past your covered call strike, then down below your cost basis for the shares you're covering before you can buy back your call. That's why people at sub 50 are perfectly legitimate fleecing fuckwit cultists for strikes north of 200 right now. They undercut the gamma squeeze since a market maker isn't hedging a retail covered call, and they still collect premiums.  


Its a win-win for existing holders that aren't part of the failed moon shots, and this is where apes don't fight apes. They skullfuck them, steal their wallets, and leave them bleeding on the road of $348.90 on March 10th."

2021-04-17 01:12:23,wallstreetbets,"I've held between 1475 and 2300ish shares, (starting a tiny bit at the first upswing at 280, a tiny more at 330, a lot more at 48, and a LOT more at 94, then accumulating more shares via re-investing daytrading swings.)  I've held back about 50% of my shares at any given moment from daytrading to sell covered calls - I sell at the morning's (high volatility) peak about $10 to $15 OTM, and usually buy them back at quiet dips, sell again at peaks. RARELY have I had to sell shares due to exercise, and those instances have usually been lucrative and I'm happy to have sold (As it was $15 OTM at a daily peak and I'd likely purchased way lower anyways, and it usually is just barely ITM anyways.) Yeah , 20% of my transactions suck and I lose, but never huge, and overall I've made a killing doing this. \*note - I've been asked to post tons of screencaps about this, which i have, I'm just done digging thru history and doing that."

This autistic argument of who is right or wrong about the mechanics of options contracts ""assets"" that in sum end of all things are nothing more than worthless pieces of paper. But fuck me sideways, I am having fun and that's why I keep coming back.

It reminds me when I was younger and we argued about why Enhancement shamans and Ret Paladins weren't allowed in a raid because their numbers were shit relatively."
2021-04-16 21:19:01,wallstreetbets,Lawyers can‚Äôt spell? Bar association in shambles
2021-04-16 20:08:32,wallstreetbets,"This has to do with the brokers that lend buyer's shares to HF. Such as Robinhood, and a few others.

Oct. 22nd a SEC rule was passed saying that brokers now gotta insure being able to back up (cover) for the total price of the loaned shares when a buyer wants their shares back. But they allowed for a six months waiver period to give brokers the time to get enough collateral for covering. Six months ends... next Thursday.

More ape speech?

By buying GME through bad brokers, they were using your money to pwn you by lending it to HF crooks, so they use it for doing things like putting it in dark pools and short selling, making tendies on you in the process.

So now the brokers doing that will be forced by law to fully pay you at whatever's the price when you decide to sell these stocks. Regardless if the stock's gone at 500, 10k or 1M.

Then you got the new DTCC rules that are about to get approved around the same time."
2021-04-16 20:15:52,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôve done good on selling covered calls on things like apple and Facebook.  Enough upward potential to sell a few strikes out and make a hundred bucks on a weekly and still absorb the movement and not a lot of downside depending on what you believe.  It‚Äôs chump change compared to big yolo moves but I also don‚Äôt obliterate my own asshole like the op.
2021-04-17 01:53:17,wallstreetbets,if you made YouTube videos I would definitely watch them
2021-04-16 20:32:47,wallstreetbets,"as a guy who did CCs A lot over the last year (i mean sell weeklies on multiple things). I only got assigned once (i don't deal in highly volatile equities). 

That assignment was on SPCE the week someone decided to make a space ETF. i got assigned at 27.5. One could argue ""you dummy, you could have sold at 60"". I could easily argue back ""i made $10/share on covered calls in 6 months, and spce is trading at 23 rn. What's to say i didn't ride it all the way down?""

In the end covered calls isn't a one size fits all. It can be insanely profitable in any market if you pay attention. or you could just end up giving up gains after gains.

And if all you are doing is selling CCs. Set alerts on your phone, once a week check upcoming catalysts and roll positions on friday or when an alert triggers. Selling CCs is not exactly rocket science that needs absolutely attention."

Obviously you can yolo $100k on PLTR weeklies and that is wsb material but there are always the commenters who are huge fans of PLTR (as I am) that will say, ‚Äújust buy shares and hold it for years‚Äù. I agree with them and I think that‚Äôs the right move but I also don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs in the spirit of this sub. But hey, that‚Äôs just my humble opinion."

2021-04-17 12:17:04,wallstreetbets,"That's not good. :(
For the longterm, my best play is nvidia. They literally killed Intel with the announcement of their ARM based Grace CPU. Maybe consider that stock.
Or if you like big data, Qualtrics is pretty interesting (cloud based subscription model. It doesn't get any better than that. Software as a service is the best). Maybe take a look. :)"
2021-04-17 12:34:15,wallstreetbets,"Bear case: all the major share holders are selling shares because they know that the company is overvalued or worse, insolvent.  They keep issuing shares to employees and themselves to rip us off and get rich. 

Bull case: insiders are taking profits after waiting 17 years to go public, finally paying themselves.
The company is compensating their talent with stock to conserve cash until they reach profitability."
2021-04-16 22:14:02,wallstreetbets,Relax. Pltr will be 100 eoy.
2021-04-16 21:26:42,wallstreetbets,Sadly made the mistake
2021-04-16 21:13:59,wallstreetbets,"You don't recall correctly lol, his calls had a strike price of like $12"
2021-04-16 22:28:57,wallstreetbets,"Already in, at a loss lol ü¶ç"
2021-04-17 14:39:42,wallstreetbets,Funny enough I tried to play AMD but got burned.  Straight down from almost $100 and fails to regain much ground.    I had Nvidia back at $96 and sold at $250 lol.  I‚Äôm trying to convince myself that somehow the doubled price is ‚Äúworth it‚Äù. I think I‚Äôm going back to my cruel mistress Tesla.  She‚Äôll rip your heart out but then drop a dozen roses on your doorstep.
2021-04-16 21:55:02,wallstreetbets,"A 67k mistake, my condolences"
2021-04-17 03:23:25,wallstreetbets,They do that to shake people out to get a good entry.
2021-04-16 23:09:01,wallstreetbets,Yeah but I think he has been in since 2019 and had calls from earlier that expired worthless.
2021-04-17 15:00:24,wallstreetbets,"I would strongly advise against Tesla. I see a lot more downward potential than upward potential.
It is really hard to justify the high price for nvidia (actually it is way cheaper than Tesla) at the first glance. But if you take a closer look at everything they announced at the GTC this week, it becomes very clear that they most likely will dominate the next 10 years. They are not a chip company anymore, they are a full service computing company.
And there is still the ARM deal pending. When that one is approved, the stock will skyrocket.

But that are just my 2 cents. It's your money :D"
2021-04-17 00:03:57,wallstreetbets,"Sick proof fucking retard lol.

2021-04-16 23:26:35,wallstreetbets,"don't despair - and no need to say goodbye - it's going to work out one of three ways, all good ones:

1. we're cool, most of the peeps on the megathread are cool, we kinda mostly get along like brothers that have to share a room, but we all come back to our roots and the megathread folks put up with us and realize what we've known all along - most of us are actually smart and fun, and they are reminded GME either did them a huge solid or their bitter fomo turns to dipping a toe back into the GME pond again. (I actually have some hope for this.)
2. everyone gets so sick of us we get our daycare back, and the mods stop worrying about SEC/liability/market manipulation concerns, cuz ***we just like the stock*** like sports fans like their team, and we need a place to simply cheer our team on - we're not here to plan how we will win, because that's clearly out of our control. ***MODS TAKE NOTE!!*** that's literally what we're doing here - cheering ourselves - and our team - on.
3. GME portfolio screencaps, memes, and posts occupy at least one spot on the main wsb page. If we need to go there, that will be our daily megathread.

I'll see you all on one of these three options monday, and/or up until we hit the 100k limit on this thread. No one is going anywhere. Aloha."

* A legend was born here because of GME. 
* The sub got 7-8 millions of new users in a month because of GME. 
* On the day of our Legend posts his final goodbye in the GME saga, you decide to close the daily megathread of GME on this sub.

I undestand your reasoning, but the action taken i do not. People are still interested in GME. GME is still a YOLO bet for many. So this sub fits. 

If you're concerned of GME threads overtaking everything else, why not create a GME flair? YOU GAINED EIGHT MILLION USERS BECAUSE OF GME. A flair is the least you can do for this.

2021-04-16 21:14:35,wallstreetbets,"Saw people posting stories what got them in. Funny enough it was AMC

I JUST got into investing in October. I‚Äôm 25, started my own business, just moved into an apartment with a roommate

I turned $11,000-$19,000 in about 4 months in the stock market joining some discord I found and they slightly started talking about AMC and then one day my roommate Comes home........


DID YOU SEE GAMESTOP?! I‚Äôm laughing like ‚ÄúHA that one is a joke no way I‚Äôd buy that so risky at that price so high‚Äù I bought in AMC hearing about the squeeze at $4.50!!!!! When the tip of January happend I went all in from my other portfolios and bought a ton of AMC around $17. 

I was down $4,000 on AMC

Then I find WSB from my discord


I find THE DFV

I FIND THE DD, the Roaring kitty YouTube 

And I realize what I‚Äôve done

At $50 when he has his hearing then updated he doubled down.... 2 days before it exploded... I‚Äôm like I ducking missed the first one but after my research this guy was up how much and didn‚Äôt sell?!?! He knows something....

I then bought about 60 shares @ $50 & still was bagholding like $14-15K in AMC of most of my money

2 days later.... KABOOM last 30 min of power hour 

I knew he was right, I knew I was right. 

I unloaded all my AMC took the L and bought in the rest around $185.

I now have $22K (every penny of my savings basically & money)

Holding 162 shares @ $140 and ready to change my life when this shit rockets.

From literally laughing when I heard it was $40 to now having just about every dime I own at $140. What a time. Love y‚Äôall"

One time for DFV and one time for the ape tribe üçå

Things may look a little different after this is all said and done but the system was broken before, in a big way. I hope the individual actions of my fellow man/ape/legend are able to break the chains of systemic poverty thrust upon the working class and poor during an economic depression and global pandemic.

I am hopeful of a transfer of wealth from the greedy who have hoarded obscene amounts of dollars and influence to do nothing good for the world and blamed the poor and working class for their 'unfortunate situation.' 

I know that my entire generation has the drive to fix the opportunities that have been left for us, but will we get the opportunity? Will this be our Great Opportunity or our Great Downfall? If I fail, know I gave it all I had and so did many of these other beautiful, diverse apes from all over the world. 

The volume has been turned up to eleven and this ride ain't over. I'm gonna give em hell. I'm gonna give em hell for my fellow apes and I'm gonna give em hell for the future. Strap in and prepare for some turbulence. Much love. üöÄ

Well, s*** hits the fan real quick when you remove the cages at a zoo because now you've got crazy ass monkeys running all over the place having a blast and even the people who hate monkeys have to put up with them now."

Unfortunately it seems as if the front page of wsb is still gme nonsense, and the unpinned thread was still getting heavily used, so I wish it would stick around, but alas, all good things must come to an end...

I've found that personally, I can focus on my life better when I'm not constantly checking reddit so I've been trying to take some time off. With the death of the Unpinned comes a sense that most of what I had been coming to wsb for is gone, so I will be going down with the ship, as they say. Once the unpinned is done, I'm done. I wish the best of luck to everyone here, Fanny convinced me to try Fizz again, Rich motivated me to hit the gym harder, and countless others of you helped contribute to all the good times.

I may check back here every now and then, but for the most part, I'm planning to stay away from reddit in general. If you see something interesting, don't hesitate to ping me :)

2021-04-17 09:53:11,wallstreetbets,"When people give up individual thinking and give in to group think, they are essentially looking for acceptance and if you objectively deny that acceptance you appear to them as everything that is wrong in this world and thus become a mortal enemy.  Unfortunately this further solidifies their group thinking because their hate for you unites them further and keeps them in their echo chamber. This is why it's important not to lose the idea of self even when identifying oneself with a cause."

Go up a higher percentage?Do they think AMC is better long term?Only thing I can come up with is they are mind fking themselves thinking because AMC is lower cost they will make more.If u think gme will go up a higher percentage, why are u buying AMC??Lol I don't know anything and I hope AMC and GME go to the moon.Just think it's much more likely with GME, BTW that ceo Aron is a hypocrite he gave bonuses to execs instead of investing in his company and basically screwed apes at the same time."

Maybe the bonuses are for them to donate to other people who may invest it right back into AMC. Who knows. To much speculation on that.

When I was invested I had a $10 price point longer term (a couple years). Doubling the stock count immediately cuts that in half. In order for that value to increase the company needs to use that money correctly. I simply don't think they can."

2021-04-16 22:01:01,wallstreetbets,"> BEV unfortunately will have some corner cases where it won't be the best solution.

Perhaps.  But with the Tesla Semi on the horizon, assuming it's not vaporware, the use cases are vanishingly small.

At some point, almost 10 years ago, I thought home fuel cell generators might be a thing... but with the Powerall (and Enphase's offerings as will as Sonnen, etc.,.) -- that use case has been eviscerated as well.

I'm not saying there's not a use case, and I'm not saying that two technologies shouldn't be allowed to exist simultaneously. 

But PLUG had @ a five year head start on Tesla back when Tesla started out as just a car company... and look where they are now."

Nobody has ever heard of them before but it's not hard to pay for a pr to get put out and wildly distributed. It doesn't cost that much. We release PR for our products and stories at work all the time. Guy probably spent a few 100 to crush a company without any facts to back up his vague lies as well as repeated info QS has already made publicly released. Crazy how easy it is to manipulate things. Hope $QS goes thru with the lawsuit.
2021-04-17 14:47:48,wallstreetbets,But QS has responded and also have provided evidence of their tech as well as demonstrated and given VW the samples to test back at their facility. Started at 1 cell layer and up to 4 layer cells now. It will continue to improve after they got a production facility capable of producing significant more cell layers last month. This guy on the other hand is a uknown hedge that they mentioned on the news and he also works out or a small home with 1 other employee and dashed around all the damaging comments. He put in small print he is not responsible for losses and if the information is out of date or inaccurate. Just a creep short trying to make a quick buck looking at slander charges now.
2021-04-17 13:06:59,wallstreetbets,Dude the short report had no backing evidence except what they claim and the short on CNBC would not answer any questions that were damaging. He just went around everything. His Hedgefund is 2 people and is a sham. $QS is already looking at legal action as the guy has nothing to back up his statements and $QS does. Also in his report in small print it writes he takes no responsibility for losses and claims and that some of it might not be accurate. Guy is as shady as they come.

You are contradicting yourself in your own comment, saying the tech is different, then saying no one knows their tech. QS might have it all figured out, but that is highly unlikely at the moment.

There are hundreds of startups working on breakthrough tech but not all of them get in the spotlight. QS did and people never stopped to actually ask some basic questions, they just followed the crowd and now QS is worth more than a lot of their potential customers (old school OEMs)"

But this is just intentions, nothing about the earnings per share o value of the company has changed yet... only the potential of it has been put into place. And let me tell you, increasing earnings and growth takes YEARS and an inordinate amount of effort. 

I agree the ‚Äúpotential‚Äù of the changes may increase its value a bit (maybe till the 35s), but for now, the earnings, profits, EPS, projected growth, etc is basically the same as before, maybe a little bit better but definitely not justifying a 100+ dollar plus valuation."

2021-04-17 06:28:00,wallstreetbets,"When you see that happening, it's usually the spoofers trying to induce buyers to move. No stock will have a 10:1 bid ratio at any given time. Very very infrequent. It has more chance of being a sell spoofer trying to get buyer to move to his determined price. Say you have a bunch of stocks you're trying to get rid of. Actual size of say 1m. You don't immediately put 1m on the offer. That's just revealing your cards. What you do is put out feelers of 10-50k and if the volume is too large to be absorbed, you then spoof the bid side by putting out huge volume order of say 1m. This has the psychological effect of getting real buyers to budge on their bids (fomo essentially). When they see your large bid, they will offer 0.01 higher so that their bid is now ahead of yours. Since you're the only real seller, if you didn't budge on your offer price, the trade won't transact. Keep repeating this until the real buyer raise the price high enough to hit your actual offer price. Spoofing done. Btw this is illegal and SEC can bring criminal charges on you. Read how many of the bank traders have been charged (some successfully) with spoofing trades."

* Call it 30 million shares there after some paperhanding, 30 on reddit, 10 for the 1 percenter whales and mini-whales, 15 foreign retail.  

* = 85 million minimum.  And that was a while ago. I'm saying Retail owns 1.5 - 2.5 x the float by now.     

* Institutional generally up. Blackrock likes the stock. Everyone does."

2021-04-17 14:10:52,wallstreetbets,"I don‚Äôt think kids need to be involved. Depending on the marriage and how they lived. 

A housewife with no kids who is basically ‚Äúemployeed‚Äù by the husband to be a home body and put her career on hold/cancel it altogether due to the husbands actions/requests should merit the same thing as a stay at home mom. Just because there are no kids doesn‚Äôt mean that the marriage didn‚Äôt effect her ability to have a career; at least that‚Äôs how I think the courts look at such things. Marriage comes first before careers, I‚Äôd you had to move across the country for your husbands career and threw away your own in the process, I would hope the court would honor your sacrifice after/when things go bad. You sacrificed for him, now he sacrifices for you. Kids or not. It‚Äôs really a big scam. #sayno

Edit: Alimony and child support are different. Figured I‚Äôd use the legal words."

2021-04-17 14:58:47,wallstreetbets,"Oh idk, but in general, women are awarded money from the court for less. I saw a case a year or two ago where a guy was fighting for Alimony because his career would have been less beneficial than his wives so he quit to be a stay at home dad while the wife made the money. They made a huge deal out of it. Equality.."
2021-04-17 16:20:48,wallstreetbets,As a woman that seems fair.
2021-04-17 16:34:59,wallstreetbets,"His wife didn‚Äôt feel the same, courts sided with him. Same family dynamic, just reversed genders. It makes sense that he‚Äôs be awarded some help given his sacrifices. Depending on what his career path wise he may or may not be able to recover financially."
2021-04-17 17:58:00,wallstreetbets,"Ugh, sometimes some women make me look bad..."
2021-04-17 10:50:41,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I'm totally sure you won't ever bring up that your financial bulge being bigger than his.  I'm also totally sure you won't ever override him on items, since most of the money is yours.  I'm also sure when you all do get divorced you will happily give him alimony since he was accustomed to a better lifestyle than the one he would have if just single."
2021-04-17 10:53:11,wallstreetbets,"If he makes the most money why shouldn't he be in charge of it?  Unless he is terrible in finances.

2021-04-17 11:27:39,wallstreetbets,Because some of it is not his money. This isn‚Äôt hard
2021-04-17 13:20:02,wallstreetbets,"Whats hard to understand about the money maker being in charge of the money?  You act like marriage if 50/50 on everything but you are stupid as fuck.  It is never like that, and especially so for women."
2021-04-17 13:26:35,wallstreetbets,"I make 60% of the money therefore I should control 100% of the money?

women making less than a man in the same position with the same seniority (on average) does not equal men in man/woman households making more. And that‚Äôs Mr. White knighting cuck"

Or google "" didi –≤ —Ä–æ—Å—Å–∏–∏ –æ—Ç–∑—ã–≤—ã "" )
You are saying that its worth now more than a billion already (or more than 5.5 million users in China as its 100th of 550 mil users  just like a billion is 100th of valuation).

There is always that chance that Sumit won't deliver but it does seem however that his precise wording indicates that they are on track. 8k filed as well. SS has consistently stated for the shareholders. The available short shares was over 2mil to 10k the other day with a rate of like 5%(higher now i believe). Seval oz frok google. Sumit is from google as well. Ford droppes velodyne and took stake in mvis. Buyout has been talked about for some time but this all could not happen and it could tank. I am a small guy but I feel pretty confident that this is going to have a jump before may. The deal with army ar/vr googles. Was an unexpected jump ($4) that since the shorts have walked down.
