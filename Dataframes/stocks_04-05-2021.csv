&#x200B;

All dividends are payable on May 3, 2021, to stockholders of record of  the respective shares at the close of business on April 9, 2021."

04/05/2021,stocks,But...but... but QYLD is 12.5%
04/05/2021,stocks,"and the Breakout to $32+ is hopefully happening soon:

BREAKOUT

**WATCH** for possible breakout above 31.07, no resistance in area just above.

Type: **True** breakout from double resistance. 

Target: **32.46, 5.7%**  Stop: 30.22  Loss: 1.6%  
 P/L ratio: 3.6 : 1 - **Excellent**"

04/05/2021,stocks,Do you think I can increase it even more if I were to have 100 shares of QYLD and sell covered calls against that? Then I get dividend and premium!
04/05/2021,stocks,Thank you for that ticker. That's the first ice ever heard of it and it sounds fantastic!
04/05/2021,stocks,You're afraid of pictures of our president automatically uploaded not of my own accord. I don't trust your opinion
04/05/2021,stocks,"That's a good ticker definitely
I just think AT&T is one of many smart investments to diversify your portfolio and invest in America's future as we plan to reopen and recoup losses during pandemic; vamping up production and hiring with the boost of Biden stimulus package and fast track of rolling out vaccines"

04/05/2021,stocks,"I think it's important to invest in stuff you believe in. This actual company I know nothing about, except that it looks like they're planning to offer at 90 cents a share which itself isn't too inspiring. Ideally you'd try to keep position sizes small and it doesn't sound like 1k is a small percentage of your total investments. However if it gets you started and motivates you to continue to invest in other things it could be a net benefit. Be aware that money in this is likely to have a liquidity issue, making the stock hard to sell if you need the money back."
04/05/2021,stocks,What’s the company?
04/05/2021,stocks,"Death & Co is the bar with the parent company being Gin and Luck.

04/05/2021,stocks," Nice. Looks like a decent company. As for what you need to know to invest, does as much research as you can, what do you think of the management? How fast so they plan on expanding? Are they currently making profit, if not, when do they plan to do so? 

If the money means a lot to you, only invest what you can afford to lose. Al investments are risky, especially with smaller companies like this that are not public yet. 

I’m far from an expert however, hopefully someone else comes along with solid advice!"
04/05/2021,stocks,Sell the news... it’s already priced in
04/05/2021,stocks,How much did you anticipate it going up? MSOS is up 10% since the NY announcement
04/05/2021,stocks,"Well, for starters, you're in the wrong weed stocks... The US ones are doing fine"
04/05/2021,stocks,"Cannabis is a commodity, nothing proprietary about weed."
04/05/2021,stocks,"Before the market takes shape and steady/predictable revenue streams are rolling in, there’s no way to tell what is and isn’t priced into the market already. It’s quintessential speculative investing. Once the senate turned blue, the market appeared to react as if it would become legal at the federal level. Why would state-level action move the needle at all?"
04/05/2021,stocks,"Why would they go up? They've already had massive run up over the past few months to a year. Especially the RH favorites like APHA and TLRY. Most of these companies are still struggling financially, and tax laws surrounding them don't lend to any optimism until that changes. They have none of the luxuries of standard banking, and are subject to intense regulations. There's still a small handful of quality investments in cannabis, but it's not like legalization is noteworthy or unexpected. There's no fundamental difference in any of these companies from last month this, and won't be until revenues, and profit, improve."
04/05/2021,stocks,"Yea, might be right. Hoping that the merger happening will be my last chance to hop off."
04/05/2021,stocks,When APHA and TLRY I will be invested in a US one.  Honestly though I’ll probably dump before that.
04/05/2021,stocks,"Right... but APHA/ TLRY is set to be a giant (biggest?) company that sells this commodity, right at the moment of legalization.  Are you eluding to the black market or competitors?"
04/05/2021,stocks,"> Before the market takes shape and steady/predictable revenue streams are rolling in, there’s no way to tell what is and isn’t priced into the market already

Yes... I was looking for an opinion, or guess.  I don’t expect anyone to read the future, sorry for confusion.

> Why would state-level action move the needle at all?

Because it’s the actual event taking place vs the rumor. Unless your under the impression federal legalization hype has increased the share prices to the equal value of federal legalization.  In that case actual federal legalization wouldn’t move the needle much either."
04/05/2021,stocks,"So to be clear, you don’t expect them (APHA/ TLRY) to move up before the merger?  

Also I believe there is legislation being passed for the standard banking point. 

Would you not include APHA/ TLRY as one of these quality investments?"
04/05/2021,stocks,I'm buying all types of Marijuana stocks because I think that the reason that stocks are so low compared to tobacco stocks is due to the lack of high powered lobbyists. I do think it will be 2030 before we see the real numbers like tobacco has. Especially when marijuana is able to advertise like tobacco does. I can easily see the next generation turn from tobacco to marijuana just due to the health risks that tobacco has.
04/05/2021,stocks,"Only if they can breach the market over others, Curaleaf for example."
04/05/2021,stocks,I’m alluding to the fact that it’s a low margin business with tons of riff raff speculating on a narrative that everyone is aware of already.
04/05/2021,stocks,">Because it’s the actual event taking place vs the rumor.

The rumour is always what is being traded, always. You can believe it or not depending on whatever you're comfortable with but you need to accept and acknowledge that this is what the other people who are buying the same stocks as you believe and do. They buy the rumour, and sell the news."
04/05/2021,stocks,"I don't think they're bad investments necessarily, I just don't see them taking off on news like legalization that everyone saw coming a year ago. The real issue is federal tax laws that don't allow them to harvest any tax deductions on their product. Every other company uses these laws, and it's often the only thing separating profitable companies from money pits.

Those two companies in particular have been run up hard from retail investors, and there's not much more room for them to go until there's an actual shift in the fundamentals. Legalization was priced in months ago, this is just confirmation. You'll need to wait for improved revenues and a better macroeconomic for serious growth."
04/05/2021,stocks,"I do think cannabis is a lucrative sector for the future, but it's just not going to pogo off small time news like state legalization that's been expected for a year or more. I'm still concerned that several companies will go bankrupt, more will merge, and there will be an overall consolidation in the market, but it's reasonable to expect at least a few to end up succeeding. But until such time that these companies can 1) grow revenue enough to outpace expenses, and 2) take advantage of future tax changes that allow them to operate like a normal business and write off losses, I see a cloudy market. Getting in now is obviously the opportunity to yield the best gains, but at a higher risk. And is may be a decade or so before the air clears. But yeah, the sector is gold if you're patient."
04/05/2021,stocks,">  riff raff speculating

This feels like a personal attack... a kid and high school swore this would make me money!

No, I really agree with all of this already.  I’m just speculating on how much of of the share price is pure hype vs actual value.  If I see 26 before merger I’m out."
04/05/2021,stocks,"On the most basic level your obviously right.  But when the rumor tends to be more and more speculative over time, an actual event popping out of nowhere almost always effects the share price...

The share price saw more action when Wyoming passed bills for legalization than NY. It’s just weird.  I understand the possibility of legalization is very built into this stock, I literally say that in my post.  That doesn’t mean that actual legalization happening in a state that has the most populated city in US shouldn’t have an effect.  Are you really completely in disagreement with this?"
04/05/2021,stocks,GL ✊
04/05/2021,stocks,"You can argue that legalization in super blue states like California, New York, etc are a foregone conclusion. Its better than 50/50 odds so why not bet on the rumour early? 

>Are you really completely in disagreement with this?

This is what im trying to get at with my original comment, it doesnt matter what we think or what conventional wisdom says. Lets say you and i and a million other people all stoutly and strongly agree that it doesnt make sense that the stock price of weed production and distribution companies doesnt go up much when the actual bill is signed into law in New York, it should theoretically be up say another 10-15%. What exactly does it matter if the price is still doing what its doing regardless of what you or i or anyone thinks? What would change? Yes you might be absolutely correct in you assessment, the certainty of a bill signed into law is a more comfortable environment to buy into weed stocks vs the simple rumour months earlier, but what difference does it make when the vast majority of people are not trading or investing under those principles? They are trading the rumour because the risk/reward equation of getting in super early is more valuable to them than the lowered risk scenario of post legalization."
04/05/2021,stocks,"Markets typically drop fast and climb slow, we’ve only had 5 or so green days after a wash of a month. Check at the end of April with some hope! I will be"
04/05/2021,stocks,"I’m red and I guess that’s mostly my fault for picking mainly EV, tech, and small cap stocks."
04/05/2021,stocks,"""after so many green days""

What are you talking about? I've had like 3 in a row after a month and a half of red dude. The last time I had 2 back to back green days was around like February 16th."
04/05/2021,stocks,Every decision i made in my first month of investing is still red. Pretty much everything i picked my second month is green.
04/05/2021,stocks,Ark is still in the red if that's what you are holding mostly.
04/05/2021,stocks,"I was -$1,200  off my $8,400 investment. I came close to breaking even today. I'm hoping after this week I'll see some green"
04/05/2021,stocks,If you bought in at all time highs in tech like a month ago you will probably be in the red for a while longer.
04/05/2021,stocks,Nah still down 17% lol
04/05/2021,stocks,Red cuz my options expired. Lost 40% of my account
04/05/2021,stocks,Still down about 10%
04/05/2021,stocks,"QQQ is not at ATH. 

If you own ultra high multiple stocks, you’re down."
04/05/2021,stocks,Down 25% 😕
04/05/2021,stocks,"Green days and red days shouldn't matter to you that much. Buy stocks you like that you think are at a good price and when they are in the red consider that a sale. 

Hyper Growth stocks you can eat up the red days and consider that money gone until the business takes off but this only works if u love the company."
04/05/2021,stocks,Extremely red. Only covered calls are green.  Actually recently it was worse than early March for me. I am 100% speculative growth stocks tho.
04/05/2021,stocks,Everything is green for me except PLTR and SFT but overall my portfolio is doing really well so far.
04/05/2021,stocks,Still down about 20 percent
04/05/2021,stocks,"Most of mine is green rn except for my one shitty spac, which today I decided to cut in half at a 20% loss. It was just too weighty on my portfolio and I got tired of seeing it red every day regardless of how the market is doing"
04/05/2021,stocks,I'm up 4% after a rough couple of months.
04/05/2021,stocks,"I was in the red around 35%, I just got back into profit due to cutting losses and reinvesting on the run up. Very happy I’m out of all that garbage I was in"
04/05/2021,stocks,"Still down, holding mostly NIO and CTXR. Got into NIO at avg cost of 47 so not down too badly. I’ll be back up soon enough I am not worried. Just holding those 2 stocks and getting some options gains"
04/05/2021,stocks,Everything is green for me that I have grabbed  this year except 1.  Overall still very green.
04/05/2021,stocks,"Oh yeah, majorly red still and probably for a couple more weeks even with mostly green. I have 3 that are up from where I bought them, but a whole bunch that fell a lot during March and will require some solid weeks to get back to even.  Even today on a mostly green market I only had 3 that went up, 10 down"
04/05/2021,stocks,Up 1% and feeling thankful.
04/05/2021,stocks,Woke up like 10% further into the green today lol
04/05/2021,stocks,Red
04/05/2021,stocks,"I’m in SLVO for the most part, only time I have red is when the sell offs happen. 

Correction; waiting for AMC to dip so I can offset the 30 shares I have at 18.61, really should have bought in at $5 when it was down 😂😂"
04/05/2021,stocks,"I’m -5%  to -12% on  things like AMD, ARKG, and ARKK. 

I’m -2% on PLTR and green on Apple. 

To be honest, I’m trying to move away some of these stocks once I break even. Think I’m going to focus on my winners. 

Apple, ARKF/X, and index funds. 

I’m very wary about investing now as I’m in this position from investing at all time high."
04/05/2021,stocks,You're never alone
04/05/2021,stocks,"I’m still 5% off my personal ATH from mid-Feb, but I’m still green by 30% YTD."

04/05/2021,stocks,Sorry just edited it.
04/05/2021,stocks,"Arkx is Cathie Wood trying to spin a relatively decent (well for ark standards if u were to look at it from value perspective) portfolio into an ""innovation"" fund. A lot of its holdings arent ridiculously overvalued and plenty of fair / under valued picks."
04/05/2021,stocks,"All good. Either way, you’re likely in high flying positions ie. things that worked last year and mostly the entire market cycle.

As challenging as it is, it’d be a good idea to try to catch the next trend towards higher quality names and value. Value can be tough, best off buying IWD/DGRO to give yourself some stability in the event that we are early stages in a multi year high multiple underperformance environment. Mega cap tech still seems ok. Smid cap tech is getting demolished."
04/05/2021,stocks,"Thanks for the input. I started investing this year. I have 45% VTI, 26% ARKK,  13% ICLN,  16% PLTR. I bought ICLN at ATH, not sure what I should do. Other two are close to breaking even but they haven't been able to. My portfolio is just $1000 so I'm just starting. I plan to buy QQQ to balance everything."
04/05/2021,stocks,Just hold. You need to take the long view and don't look every day.
04/05/2021,stocks,Go cash and buy the dip when it happens will be the most sensible
04/05/2021,stocks,"puts on spy/qqq/growth companies such as tsla, calls on volatility (vxx, uvxy), calls on inverse etfs (sqqq, spxs)"
04/05/2021,stocks,"I would forget about shorting and focus on picking up really good companies at really good prices.  Prepare beforehand.  Make a list of companies.  These don't have to be growth companies; a slower grower at a fantastic price can result in growth stock-like returns until the stock comes up to fair value, and the slower growers are usually less risky.   Calculate the intrinsic values of the companies then come up with dream prices that will give you fantastic returns.  Wait.  During the crash use limit orders to capture an extreme inter day price.  Maybe you get lucky with a few of the companies.  The stocks you do buy are good for above average returns for at least a few years, and maybe they turn into long term holds."
04/05/2021,stocks,lmao we can't have a couple of green days in peace
04/05/2021,stocks,Very pleased to see plenty of bearishness out there still. SPY $420 it is..
04/05/2021,stocks,Buy alcohol stocks lol. At the beginning of all crashes those go up.
04/05/2021,stocks,"I feel like right now is a terrible time to be shorting the market. But, hey, thats just me."
04/05/2021,stocks,"Well the real question should be ""how do I predict a market crash"". Knowing who to short is pretty pointless if you don't know when the market will tank. They happen so quick. Hence why so many get fucked"
04/05/2021,stocks,Somebody watched a big short once looks like it
04/05/2021,stocks,"The easiest way is to just buy inverse market etfs. There are more than a few good options.

04/05/2021,stocks,"There is a play that has emerged so far for this year, but it might be starting to get too obvious. 

I'll just say that based off this pattern, unless you're trading intraday, you DO NOT want to be short or buying puts right now unless something gives you confirmation of it. Now, I'm not a charter, so anybody that is interested is going to have to develop their own idea, but what I've seen so far this year is that outside of that one-off tantrum in early March (where SPX and the Dow somehow still managed to finish green for the week anyway), is that this market is weak after options expire every month (which is the third Friday of each month) and at its strongest early in the month.

Edit: The only thing that's different right now is SPX is already pretty stretched, but that could well just not matter."

Naked puts on our case is just profiting in case that shareholders may want them, nothing more. Getting a fair price and actually capitalizing off them at the right time is the hard part, and unless you are buying an inordinate amount of them, your profit as their additional cost is still negligible to someone with, say, a million shares.

I’m a pretty big believer in growing all the market but sometimes the undergrowth gets out of hand and the whole thing can burn down. No sense in not clearing out your back yard in anticipation."

That's fairly terrible advice. Puts and shorts are not just gambling. They have a very respectable place in any fundamental investor's portfolio. 

Think the broad semiconductor market will outperform TXN? Cool, short $100 of TXN and long $100 of SOXX (or vice versa if you think TXN outperforms SOXX).

Got a portfolio of equities you're needing minor vol insurance against? Great, grab OOTM puts for cheap vega hedges.

04/05/2021,stocks,those 3 stocks weren't trading last year so there's no reference point. TSLA lost -50% from March 1 - 18
04/05/2021,stocks,[deleted]
04/05/2021,stocks,Right now I may load up my yolo otm puts. Fuck Elon the scammer.
04/05/2021,stocks,"Delicious, can’t wait till it crashes to zero. Wish I could afford the March 2023 $200 puts."
04/05/2021,stocks,"you're talking about Barrick? bro - I'm looking at the chart and it lost -40%  at its lowest. From March 6-16 

gold and gold miners bounced with the rest of the market thereafter."
04/05/2021,stocks,which share price?
04/05/2021,stocks,[deleted]
04/05/2021,stocks,"lol first you said gold now tech - everything crashed last year

you don't know how to read a chart do you."
04/05/2021,stocks,"Got in at 180 after earnings drop. I didn't think it would break 200 before dropping lower. Hard to know what the future holds. I feel more comfortable holding my walmart stock than Target even know target is the better store to shop at. Costco, Walmart, Target all have woken up finally."
04/05/2021,stocks,"The store pickup where they bring stuff to your car is super popular and the ""I need this today"" crowd are still stopping by Target after work vs. e-commerce.    

Also Becky's love shopping at Target.    Stock itself didn't get whacked too bad by COVID.  Solid investment imo."
04/05/2021,stocks,Idk I would personally bet e-commerce. I have no chips in TGT or any e-commerce
04/05/2021,stocks,180 was a great time to get in. I agree all three are waking up and are great buys in their own rights. I just feel strongly TGT has huge growth potential and is gaining momentum
04/05/2021,stocks,"TGT’s growth has been their embracing of e-commerce. They have same day delivery, quick in store pick up or someone will bring it to your car. They acquired Shipt to organize people with instacart/post mates type orders that need to be filled and delivered today (grocery orders).

TGT is a long term winner who will keep growing. Look around your area - general shopping needs are probably limited to Walmart, Target and some regional things (Meijer is an example around me)."
04/05/2021,stocks,"I think TGT has hit a sweet spot where they are an essential business and keep foot traffic that way. They have great same day pickup too. So those are 2 areas I think are tougher for e-commerce to penetrate. They are not without their own e-commerce, but it’s the brand loyalty and complete set of offerings that really creates value"
04/05/2021,stocks,Your case seems kind of similar to a bet of urbanization vs ruralization
04/05/2021,stocks,"My perspective: 
Target, similar to CostCo, has the ability to make shoppers love their store - unlike Walmart. They, along with Walmart, offer good pickup services. However, target “targets” higher-income consumers. This sort of eliminates growth in the Walmart consumer area. E-commerce is now also having 1 day shipping and, in some cases, same day shipping. Once same day shipping becomes a regular basis, I do not see how brick and mortar can compete. Target has been trying to deliver on e-commerce, yet they are not where Amazon is. Additionally, E-commerce offers more selection than brick and mortar."
04/05/2021,stocks,"Damn I will say compelling points. I can’t get away from my belief the in person retail experience will continue in spite of e-commerce, covid or what have you. There is a psycho social element to it. Most people want to see more than their own living space on any given day. They want to go out and do things and spend money. This is also what the economy as a whole wants too. 

I think we are (hopefully) moving politically towards higher wages, more affordable education and better quality of life for all. TGT meanwhile, is pretty competitive on their prices especially for having their own chic. I think those two elements actually position a business like TGT exceptionally well"
04/05/2021,stocks,"I’d agree that people generally want to be outside of their own living space on a daily basis. Though this can be anywhere: work, sporting events, restaurants, bars, etc. Also, higher wages are not necessarily good for the business at all. Higher wages = increased prices. Target customers can take the higher prices but this prevents target from acquiring Walmart customers. Will target be a decent investment 5 years from now? Probably. Though, if I am stock picking and have options of 1000s of companies, is it the best, or anywhere close to it? I would say definitely not."
04/05/2021,stocks,"I think TGT already paid on the higher end so if for example we adopted a national $15 minimum wage they would be less affected than say Walmart (Costco virtually not at all). 

I think I have a particular affinity for them because I first got in at $90 around 18 months ago and just kept watching them grow. I have a very conservative portfolio so I’m usually happy with slow and steady growth, I just feel Target provides the security of a blue chip with a growth potential closer of a mid cap"
04/05/2021,stocks,"I fully understand the “ride the winners” mentality. Their PE will allow them to not be obliterated if a crash were to occur. It’s just their margins are so damn low. Personally, I have a 50 year horizon on all my stocks, so my outlook on stocks like target are definitely a little peculiar. They a large stock, not as much room for growth as a small cap, of course. Perhaps if they converted their stores to warehouses I would be more intrigued. Best of luck 🤞"
04/05/2021,stocks,Thank you best of luck to you too! 🍀
04/05/2021,stocks,Liquidity doesnt matter too much when its an investment. Choosing between NTO and NTDOY is just a matter of currency risk. Would you rather be exposed to the euro or dollar? If its a long term investment i wouldnt worry about any of this too much and just buy any
04/05/2021,stocks,Because you’re inexperienced and young. It’ll take some time to find more comfort.
04/05/2021,stocks,"Michael Burry predicted the ‘07 housing crash in 2005. Sometimes you can predict something but it takes time for it to actually happen. 


Also.  Let’s not forget bears predict the last market crashes 20 out of 3 times."
04/05/2021,stocks,"50% cash is not advisable crash or no crash. Give it ten years, you’ll see the rationale to override the fear you have now."
04/05/2021,stocks,"It’s understandable to be weary of a potential loss. I’m twice your age and also expect a crash but there have been crashes both major and minor throughout history. Just do a ton of research on the securities You want to invest and hope for the best. Don’t check your account hourly or daily. It’ll drive you crazy. I have an ETF sitting in a Roth account. I don’t plan on touching it until I’m retired. Or if I die it’ll go to my beneficiary. Most is also on blue chip stock and few stocks I “gamble” with, short term.  Good luck on your journey. Baby steps. It’ll all make better sense with time in the market."
04/05/2021,stocks,"First off I want to applaud you for entering the market at your age, there’s an incredible opportunity to build real wealth by letting compounding interest do its thing.

In general, trying to time the market is not a successful long-term strategy. If you’re interested in a multi-sector ETF like S&P 500, dollar cost averaging is your friend. Setup recurring purchasing with your broker and forget about it.

If your dead set on picking individual stocks, than you must challenge yourself to have a fundamental understanding of each company in your portfolio. Otherwise it’s not investing, it’s speculation — which is fine, just know the difference.

Purchasing good companies today at a reasonable evaluation, with a 30+ year investment time horizon... you’ll do just fine, regardless of the market downturns along the way.

Continue improving your financial literacy, continue investing in yourself to better your earning potential, and continue broadening your circle of competence — the wealth will follow.

Not financial advice, just my opinions from bad and good decisions ✌️"
04/05/2021,stocks,The thing is I've been thinking there was going to be a market crash for the last 5 years...it had Absurd growth last year. If it crashes it might legitimately just go down to 2018 prices...But who's to say it doesn't crash for another 5 years and then it just crashes down to 2023 prices...also who's to say it doesn't crash tomorrow and plummet down to 2008 prices. Truth is we don't know. If I were you I would put in a certain amount every pay period...and when/if the market crashes increase how much you put in. If it crumbles and burns cut expenses all the way and put in double and triple. If it crashes a little bit bump up your contributions by whatever you feel comfortable with. The march crash didn't really last long enough for me to make too much money off of it. Only a couple pay periods. But I tripled my contributions. And then in June I dropped it back down to regular. I don't know if every company offers the ability to change contribution amounts so quickly and easily. I know my small company pays a small fortune for the person we have handle our accounts so that might or might not be one of his perks.
04/05/2021,stocks,"Whaaaat?!!! You've just decided to stereotype a whole swathe of the population! Those 50 - 90 year olds. All hanging out together, doing the same thing without a care in the world and oblivious to the imminent market carsh. Thank goodness for the 18 - 49 year old to show us the error of our ways!"
04/05/2021,stocks,"My opinion a crash is coming, does that mean you shouldn't buy, no absolutely not. Not buying in due to fear of a crash is not a good financial decisions at all, just buy stocks that are at fair value and are not super overextended, also look into emerging markets for less risk. The main reason I say not buying is nor smart is because you don't know how long this euphoria can last. However the sentiment right now is extremely bullish and many permabears I know are throwing in the towel, these are general signs of a late stage bull market."
04/05/2021,stocks,"Here’s a fundamental truth: a crash is coming. No one knows when and no one knows how bad. Just assess your risk appetite and risk capacity most importantly and just keep plowing money in regularly. 

By the way 50% cash is excessive. It’s not a productive asset by itself and inflation is eroding your purchasing power. Hedge by drawing the cash down to a comfortable level and buy equities."
04/05/2021,stocks,Bears are pushing this theory right now. Personally I don’t see any logic behind it - at the end of the day life will be getting back to normal and growth will be the best it’s been in my lifetime. Add in low rates and tons of liquidity being out of the market seems like a massive mistake. I see zero catalysts for a potential crash.
04/05/2021,stocks,"Diversified portfolio and 10-15% stop losses can probably protect against a crash somewhat decently. I also bought a handful of cheap put leaps for more hedging, because there do seem to be a few more indicators than usual of a bubble bursting.

10% drop isn't so bad. That's recoverable within a year, or 2 max, even in a very tepid market. You just don't want to ride down a 30-50% crash if that were to happen. If you lose 50%, you'd have to then be up 100% to break even. Stop losses prevent that scenario."
04/05/2021,stocks,"IMO, we won’t see a crash per sey, what we will see is a lot of juvenile traders who got hooked on the whole meme fiasco end up going bankrupt in the next 12-16 months, and the market volume will decrease as they lose capital, the market will dip accordingly and stabilize. That’s the issue when uninformed/uneducated youths start “gambling” their student loans away"
04/05/2021,stocks,"ok so what? being early is the same as being wrong. you can hold cash or have short positions all you want (and lose money until you're right) but the reality is, it doesn't matter unless you time it right and 99% of the time you won't. this is why DCAing will always win."
04/05/2021,stocks,a crash is always coming. and when it comes you should keep enough liquid in place so you can BUY like there is no tomorrow.
04/05/2021,stocks,Even if it crashes you wont time it correctly.
04/05/2021,stocks,"Will it grow without hiccups? I’m very sure that that won’t be the case. There will be many speed bumps — especially because we’re at a crossroads economically, socially, and environmentally. The roads ahead are rough, but the feds will time and time again defend and protect the market above all else."
04/05/2021,stocks,"Genuine question - do you truly believe the market will hold for the next 5 years? Solid growth, no crashes?"
04/05/2021,stocks,Woah! Twenty out of three times? They must be really good at their jobs! /s
04/05/2021,stocks,Especially considering that even cd’s won’t give you a decent rate on your cash.  Past an emergency fund it has made little sense to keep much cash for 20 years.
04/05/2021,stocks,Thanks for the advice.
04/05/2021,stocks,"That's why I'm going with the 50/50 route for the time being. Just want to stay prepared. I also tried to address the problem of ""fear"" by recognizing that a crash is unlikely to bring a stock down to it's 5-10-20 year lows."
04/05/2021,stocks,"My main concern right now is 40 years ago, the stock market was doing well because of genuine economic growth. It just doesn't feel like we're growing non-artificially anymore."
04/05/2021,stocks,"Here's the problem the cape ratio on the s&p is at 37 the second highest in history. The market is up 20% since pre covid highes. And the froth is not limited to tech and growth stocks like John deere are up 100% when revenue declined or how Hilton is at all time highes despite all the new debt they took on. Add to the the fact that good news is bullish and bad news is bullish, basically news is bullish, these are all indicators of a late stage bull market. Also if you what a catalyst look at SLR"
04/05/2021,stocks,"in order for holding cash to make sense youll have to be a lot closer on that guess than ""next 5 years""

oh, and youll have to effectively time your buys during the crash. it isnt particularly easy to time the bottom, or even get near the bottom .


crashes and pullbacks arent uncommon at all historically. ofc therell be a crash at some point."
04/05/2021,stocks,"Oh yeah. 


Over here on Reddit, back in April 2020 all the bears predicted the market to continue crashing due to COVID. 


Then in May 2020 all the bears said to hold out to avoid the bull trap. 


Then in September 2020 the bears were sure of a September crash. 


Then in October 2020, everyone just knew a major October crash was going to happen. I remember everyone was saying they’re selling out to buy the double dip recession we were going into and our stock market was going to end up like Japan’s."
04/05/2021,stocks,"Technological advancement are exponential the human brain has been proven to have a difficult time understanding this, iv studied exponential algorithms in my uni courses and i still sometimes am amazed by them. We will keep growing because we will discover technology that you simply cant comprehend in your current frame of mind. Of course it will crash along the way but statistically that doesn’t matter. You are far more likely to fuck yourself by trying to outsmart the market then The actual crash will cause, providing you don’t panic, are able to stay rationale and have a long investment horizon."
04/05/2021,stocks,There is a drop of 10% or more every 2 years I believe
04/05/2021,stocks,I'd say getting a stock 10-20% lower would be a huge win in my book. Definitely not trying to time the bottom.
04/05/2021,stocks,youd hold cash for up to 5 years to buy a 10-20% dip?
04/05/2021,stocks,"Hmm. Probably not 5 years. That was just a hypothetical. I would say I'm probably expecting a crash early 2023. I'm still working out the numbers for what would be the most effective hedge, but at the end of the day, it's a hedge, right? Potential growth is capped in return for limited potential loss. Please feel free to correct me."
04/05/2021,stocks,"Not one person know the answer to your question however, it might or not happen. Each individual has a different strategy when it comes to investing. If you want more stable growth and less swings i would say go with the ETF if you want quicker profits go with individual stocks. I’m think we are fine at least for another year."
04/05/2021,stocks,"No, the stocks you have in your taxable brokerage account will not transfer over into the IRA."
04/05/2021,stocks,"WeBull is the China version of Robinhood. 

Stay away from it.

Go to a real brokerage."
04/05/2021,stocks,"You need to do this: >> open IRA, transfer money into that, and purchase stock then to get  tax benefit

The stocks you have purchased now are sitting in a brokerage account and you will pay capital gains tax if you sell < a year. It's best to trade in an IRA because only your contributions (the money you transferred in) and withdrawals (if you don't meet certain criteria) are taxed. Any gains you make in the account aren't touched.

That being said, I wouldn't use WeBull."
04/05/2021,stocks,Why WeBull? Personally I couldn’t be caught dead using them.
04/05/2021,stocks,"You sound new to stocks (if so, welcome!). IRA is for retirement, and so it grows tax free. You should look into if a traditional IRA or Roth IRA is better for you. It all depends on your tax bracket, and how much you have saved for retirement.

Don't put money into an IRA unless you are willing to let it sit until you are 65. There are penalties for taking it out early."

I mean just look at their revenue growth. It's ridiculous. MuddyWaters has a short report on the company and is famous for uncovering chinese scams. You might want to look into that."
04/05/2021,stocks,"If you're wanting to buy the floor, you should wait for the bounce."

Don't like the stock but it may come back."
04/05/2021,stocks,"I don't know much about GSX, but my question is did you buy just because it fell or did you do your own research and valuation on it? Maybe it was way overpriced because Archegos had pushed it up and now it is still falling to a fair valuation. This may not be the case with you, but I encourage all investors to do research on a company and then come up with what they believe is a fair price before buying - because the market is not always rational."
04/05/2021,stocks,"Did the same thing. But got out last week took a small loss. 

Was a risky play. I never checked the price since so seeing this makes me feel better..... for now lol.

Anything can happen I suppose. The company is fraudulent it seems. Only thing to make it go back up would be more shady activity I imagine.

But then again I dont know much of anything so. Do your thing."

04/05/2021,stocks,"Its a little difficult because the reported revenues are insane. Too good. But as someone else said Muddywaters did have a report on this company, claiming fraud. I was aware of all that had happened last year before investing. Its really just a gamble at this point, and i don't think i want to be in anymore. Will closeout my position premarket tomorrow. Thank you for the help"
04/05/2021,stocks,"Chinese stocks are so non-transparent. It's incredibly hard finding out if they are a scam or not. That's why I always adjust the fair value of chinese stocks with a possibility of fraud lol

I would be lying if I didn't think about buying GSX, but I did not put any effort into researching the company. 

So, I can't give you an elaborate opinion on GSX. Like I said, it's more of a feeling. You know - the good old ""If something looks like it is too good to be true, it probably is.""

Anyhow, I think there are probably a bunch of very nice chinese stocks out there. One of them (I hope) is DOYU. That's the only chinese stock I own and makes up only like 5% of my pf. They are also very cheap atm."
04/05/2021,stocks,"Honestly i stay out of most companies based in Asia, for the same reason you just said, the non-transparency. I made this buy against my better judgment, lesson learned, thanks for ur thoughts."
04/05/2021,stocks,It’s not just Chinese companies that are fraudulent though so I wouldn’t lump all of them together. If someone is intentionally cooking the book it can take a very long time before they’re discovered despite how transparent they may be to auditors.

04/05/2021,stocks,"I have a good amount of EPD, in my opinion it's significantly undervalued for a highly profitable and cash producing business with outstanding management. 

That said, it's a publicly traded limited partnership, so there are tax implications for holding. You'll get a K1 and have to file extra tax forms. Also you won't be taxed on the distributions until you sell, but when you do sell, all the distributions you've received will be treated as if they reduced your cost basis and you'll end up paying capital gains on them."
04/05/2021,stocks,"Never invest based on dividend alone. EPD has a history of 20% drops regularly over the last 5 years. If you invest for an 8% dividend but lose 20% on the stock price, it was not worth it."
04/05/2021,stocks,"I have had a ton of EPD in my Roth IRA for over a decade.  No tax on the K1 dividend, nor do you need to file K1 on taxes as it is in your Roth.  Has worked well thus far. When it drops, re-invested dividend buys more shares."
04/05/2021,stocks,Look at ETV.  Slightly higher yield
04/05/2021,stocks,"I bought a significant amount of this back when it was \~$18....one of the investment analysts I subscribe to did a detailed workup on them, and I was convinced that the risk of reduced distributions was negligible and the risk of price reduction over my holding period (probably >5 years) for this would be low relative to potential upside (possibly doubling).  

It doesn't pay a dividend, it pays a distribution.  It's a distinction with a difference, because you'll be a limited partner -- you're actually getting a return of invested capital as the distribution *and* a share of the income (which should be a loss, because of depreciation).  The tax implications are a bit complex (and I *look forward* to doing complicated taxes, because I'm weird) -- you have to track your basis which goes down with distributions and up with net operating losses, complexity when you sell, complexity if your basis drops to zero, and taxes owed if the partnership shows net income not offset by distributions.  

But....it's possibly 2X undervalued, and I bought it late last summer when I could make 10.5% in tax-deferred distributions in a company that has never, ever reduced its distribution.  It was one of the things I rotated into last summer that looked undervalued, and it's doing well (of course, in this crazy market, everything looks like its doing well -- we'll have to wait for a correction to see what bets were right).  It's a good income producer and a way to get tax-deferred gains in non-retirement accounts."
04/05/2021,stocks,"I thought that too so I bought 100 shares or so. My fundamentals research has me on the fence on if it’s a value trap or not tbh. I haven’t sold but I’m also not going to buy more right now. 

All this to say, I don’t think the company is in trouble but I also don’t think it’s div payout percent is sustainable based on the most recent few years of earnings."
04/05/2021,stocks,"If you’re holding for a year doesn’t seem worth it. You have to deal with the K-1 and return of capital portions of the dividends lower your cost basis, increasing your capital gains. Park it somewhere else to lessen the hassle or hold it forever imo."
04/05/2021,stocks,I think a lot of pipelines are fantastic investmentments. There are pipeline cef like tyg and ntg and kyn that are discounted to nav but be careful they are leveraged. U won't have to do k1 but will have to pay taxes on dividends if u do cef
04/05/2021,stocks,Always amazed when people will buy something just for the dividend.
04/05/2021,stocks,Someone told me that You  are  taxed once  your distribution gains equal your cost basis ( basically how much you invested ).
04/05/2021,stocks,So as long as it's in the Roth you don't have to worry about extra tax forms?
04/05/2021,stocks,"It’s called dividend investing, look it up sometime :)"
04/05/2021,stocks,"Haven't run into that yet, might have to research more. Either way, OP would have \~12 years until it became an issue."
04/05/2021,stocks,Correct
04/05/2021,stocks,Any guesses why renewables across the board were down? Just a rougher time for small caps compared to FAANG?
04/05/2021,stocks,Thank you!
04/05/2021,stocks,GameStop was down like 3. I wouldn’t say it sank. It was attacked by hedgies then bounced right back. No one is selling.
04/05/2021,stocks,"Hard to say really, either it's some kind of profit taking in the clean energy sector or maybe like you say it was just a day for mega caps to thrive. IMO there are a lot of headwinds for clean energy, so today's industry wide dip was quite the surprise"

04/05/2021,stocks,Profits are profits good job
04/05/2021,stocks,Can't go broke taking a profit!
04/05/2021,stocks,I’m a fan of taking profits. Should’ve/Could’ve will kill you. Take your profits
04/05/2021,stocks,"I can give you 2 personal examples of my own trades to solidify the meaning behind profits are profits. 

AMD - Purchased 90C on 2/1, 4/16 exp. 

* If you follow the technical and fundamental analysis of AMD, the stock has been looking for a breakout since forever. I thought I did well for myself timing close to one of the bottoms. Little did I know there would be an inexplicable crash after a great Q4 earnings, a tech overvaluation with an industry rotation, etc. I was up 50% at one point *very early* on in my option (within days), decided to hold for a month instead, and ended up realizing a 90% loss.

BABA - Various calls and puts after the drop from 300 back in Nov 2019.

* I *was* and *am* still super long on BABA. I don't see how this stock is not 300+. What I didn't *appreciate* properly was that the FUD surrounding BABA would far outweigh the fundamentals at least in the ""short term"" and not the other way around. I thought BABA found support after the initial drop from 320 to 250 in a 2 weeks timespan. Boy was I wrong. The FUD was just beginning and it's still going on. I went from +25% unrealized to -90% realized.

No body ever lost money taking a profit."
04/05/2021,stocks,"You are a winner. Take this story about Doof Us. Doof bought calls for ~5k. Stock zoomed 100% and Doof was looking at 15,000% return. Doof in his infinite wisdom vigilantly watching the stock price decided gains weren’t enough gains so he held. He kept holding even as the returns sank further and further, it will come back up he said. It will and it did, it made a modest return, but Doof still wasn’t satisfied because it wasn’t quite that sexy 15,000%. So he held and held some more until poof, the calls opened and eventually expired out of the money that Friday magically after bad news. Don’t be like me... Doof I mean"
04/05/2021,stocks,I say take your money and run.  For my first calls I turned 350 into almost 600 and thought I had robbed a bank.  For a quick turnaround that's great money.  Keeping your risk as low as possible will be a great way to learn instead of losing everything because you got greedy.  Slow and steady usually wins this race.
04/05/2021,stocks,"Are you happy with the gains? If so fuck everyone else and their opinions.


Now keep in mind you may think you're the best at trading now and prepare to post all your loss porn. Go slow and play slow.


Always remember 90% of options expire worthless and don't gamble what you can't lose."
04/05/2021,stocks,Trust your gut. Nice job taking profits.
04/05/2021,stocks,"You did good.  Since it's your first trade, the most important thing was to learn how to trade an option.   You got an education and made money.  Most people have student loans after doing that.

Now you only have about 200 more hours of reading and thousands of hours of trading to learn if you actually sold too early."
04/05/2021,stocks,First ones on the house bud
04/05/2021,stocks,"You will drive yourself crazy trying to pick the exact best time to make a profit. You make your decision, take your profits and move on.,, That's a win"
04/05/2021,stocks,Nah you're good. I have been buying small contracts every 2 days and selling. Double my money every time. Granted it's only about $60-$180 I am playing with but to get that amount back plus the same amount through profits is nice.
04/05/2021,stocks,"When you’re starting out, take profits. Don’t stress about leaving too early. For all we know, the stock can be $0 tomorrow. Build that foundation of cash."
04/05/2021,stocks,"Do that 30 days in a row and mathematical you become a millionaire (if you constantly roll over your profits and subsequently your bets).

04/05/2021,stocks,"Can anyone explain call options to one who’s never done or even attempted to execute a call option, don’t you have to have enough money for Atleast 100 shares to perform a call option?"
04/05/2021,stocks,"As someone who often tries too hard to time the peaks and has learned his lesson not to - trust me, take those profits and revel in them. Trying to perfectly time things will more often than not end up with you losing out.

Start making yourself some sell rules based on the Greeks and your best / worst / average case scenario. Even if your predictions aren't perfect, you'll at least know what to look for."
04/05/2021,stocks,25 cents is great. Don’t feel bad just always average a profit.
04/05/2021,stocks,"What I have learned in the last month is that (pain from hypothetical profits of profitable positions) < (pain from watching your account in the deep red for weeks).

So yeah, nice job."
04/05/2021,stocks,So the addiction has begun. See you in the WSB DT next week. Godspeed
04/05/2021,stocks,Options trading will make you feel like you second guess yourself a lot. Trust your gut and don’t look back.
04/05/2021,stocks,"Congrats on the profit.  Never regret deciding to take a profit.  At that moment, with thr information you had, you made a decision.

It's easy to look back and second guess, but note:  looking back you have more information than when you originally made it.  It's not apple to apples.

The only thing you can do, is analyze the data, do a DD of everything right up to your decision making point.  Disregard everything after.  Justify your decision based on the information at hand up to the decision making point.  You'll likely make thr same choice, buy you might find new places to get data for your DD from."
04/05/2021,stocks,I was up ~$10k on BTO GME 4/16 400c for $4.00 but didn’t sell and it’ll probably expire to nothing soon enough. Taking profits is always a win
04/05/2021,stocks,"My personal rule is establishing price targets where I take profits or cut losses before each option I buy. It will keep you from getting emotional in your trade, set rules and stick to them and you’ll be fine."

04/05/2021,stocks,can anyone explain how call option trade works please?
04/05/2021,stocks,I dont understand options. I would like to apply for it on webull and learn. Any good starting tips?
04/05/2021,stocks,Not to that level but we’ve all been there 😭
04/05/2021,stocks,"Couldn’t agree more with this. Profits are profits.   Don’t risk more than you’re willing to lose for internet friends/points. Know what your goal is with each trade and if something doesn’t look right, there is absolutely nothing wrong with taking a small loss to avoid a more disastrous trade. 

Some of my best decisions were taking a loss when a trade went sideways (lost XX instead of XXXXX)."
04/05/2021,stocks,"You know what, you’re right. 30% profit isn’t too shabby."
04/05/2021,stocks,Why not just *sell* small contracts every 2 days?
04/05/2021,stocks,Statistically the chances of this happening are extremely slim. Prob loses his ass by the end of week one.

04/05/2021,stocks,Same. Been wanting to do it but scared I'm choosing the wrong put/call buy/sell for what I actually want to do lol
04/05/2021,stocks,"In most cases (i.e. brokerage you use) you don't. You can pay a premium ($X.XX) PER SHARE for the option to sell or buy at a specific price by a specific date. Minimum you can do this in is blocks of 100 (so if you see it listed at 50¢ premium, that means a qty of 1 [really 100] costs $50). Should your option end up ""in the money"" (e.g. share price hit $55 and you had an option to buy at $50) you can either sell the option itself (provided not expired) or you can exercise. My brokerage offers the option to either fully execute (buy options at strike price then immediately sell them all at market price for a profit) or to execute and sell enough to cover the cost of the shares and allowing you to keep the remaining shares (about 10 in this example). Or if you have the funds (or margin), you could exercise and buy all 100 shares and hold."
04/05/2021,stocks,"Can’t tell if you are trolling but please don’t use options if you’re asking these questions. Please do some reading off of Reddit first. You need cash for 100 shares if you’re selling a cash secured call or put. Otherwise you need enough to buy the premium if you’re buying to open the contract. If you want to exercise the option then you would need cash for those 100 shares at your strike price on the contract. If you buy the contract and just sell it, that’s the end of the transaction."
04/05/2021,stocks,"If you intend to exercise the option, yes, you will pay for 100 shares at the strike price.

But most people who trade options close their positions before expiration. In this way, options are used as leveraged exposure to a stock's volatility without having to purchase (or sell) 100 shares."
04/05/2021,stocks,You mean buying for 80.00 and selling for 10.50?
04/05/2021,stocks,Look up in the money on YouTube. Will explain to you better than Reddit
04/05/2021,stocks,"Buy options 6+ weeks out unless you are scalping (hold less than like 30 min). Time is more important than buying ITM, although it helps. Consider learning about spreads. Not everyone needs to gamble with naked puts and call. I’ve turned $300 into $1500 in an hour but I’ve also done the other way around. Learned my lesson. Take profits. Set AND NEVER MOVE a stop loss. Manage risk carefully. Decide what price you will enter based on what reasoning, and figure out your exit points (take profit level and stop loss). Don’t change it and get emotional. You will lose I guarantee it. Trade with a plan and make sure the math works out with the risk/reward ratio. Good luck."
04/05/2021,stocks,"Inthemoney on YouTube has a great beginners options playlist. He's very good at explaining things in a simple manner so you may want to watch those. Also selling options may be a bit easier to start with. CSP can be a way to buy the stocks you want to hold, instead of a regular limit buy order. Set a strike for your CSP at the limit you'd like to pay, and pick an expiry at least a month out if you can wait. You can collect some premium while you wait for it to hit the price you want. Rinse and repeat until you get assigned."
04/05/2021,stocks,"Agreed, don't try to play this hypothetical compounding game with options."

04/05/2021,stocks,"Price movement is combo of both institutional incompetence and stock offering however I think overall the fall was inevitable. Their most recent 3 billion dollar offering triggered the majority of events that lead to its slide. A large hedge fund was way over leveraged and betting on Viacom when analysts downgraded it and the offering news came the stock slid which triggered margin calls for the hedge fund and forced the liquidation of hundreds of millions of shares. If you look at the 1Y chart on Viacom you can see it made an outrageous run. 

In regards to future outlook, they are considered to be behind in the streaming game and are definitely still piecing together their vision while other streaming giants are already off the runway. I am not personally very bullish on them however there are a lot of arguments to be made for CBS given they do have a decent content lineup.

If you don’t mind me pressing a little further, was there some catalyst for the crazy run before they got decimated?"

04/05/2021,stocks,Article I linked speculates that part of the run up was due in part to Archegos (the hedge fund mentioned above) cranking the price. Allegedly Archegos was pretty much 500% leveraged. But this is all speculation however I think it accounts for a solid portion of the run. I also think a lot of people had optimism that CBS could hang with the big boys with the tools in front of them and then they issued 3 billion dollars worth of stock and it made a lot of investors rethink just how long the road ahead was for CBS. But that’s how I see it personally!

04/05/2021,stocks,"Posted elsewhere in this thread, and then had a 2nd thought.  


If you get margin on your apple shares, you can leverage the equity you've built in your apple stocks to get $$ for options"
04/05/2021,stocks,"Personally, I don't like this idea. 

There is approximately at 60% chance these expire out of the money. If you keep your shares, your gains might not be as high, but you also don't run a not insignificant risk of straight up losing your money.

It is much safer to buy long expiration options deep in the money. Yes, these contracts are more expensive, but there is less risk of them expiring worthless."

04/05/2021,stocks,If apple stays flat for 2 years that would be concerning for the world economy
04/05/2021,stocks,It was a great suggestion if he had 100 shares though.

04/05/2021,stocks,"I haven’t dug in to the IPO filing at all, why have they consistently been losing so much money? Unless they turn profitable, with above the average retail margins, the stock looks overvalued still."
04/05/2021,stocks,Petco has went public in the past before doing a cut and run. Also the stores suck. I think Chewy and Tractor Supply are much more attractive picks.
04/05/2021,stocks,I hate shopping at overpriced petco. I like chewy.
04/05/2021,stocks,"This company is still 75% owned by a private equity group. The balance sheet is quite leveraged and that is before the $1 billion of long term lease obligations. Do not ignore lease obligations when evaluating balance sheet risk for a retail chain. This is not to say it is dangerously leveraged.

It was taken private for $4.6 billion in 2015 and is currently worth $8.5 billion (before leases which are not usually counted in enterprise value). Personally, I think 14x EBITDA is a bit steep  for this company. FCF generation is also on the very low end for a mature retailer at 2% (FCF/revenues). HD is double that, for comparison, and pays a dividend and has none of the balance sheet risk for only slightly slower growth and a 16x EBITDA multiple.

I think WOOF is a much better risk/reward 20% cheaper from $21, \~$16-17.

As unfair as it is, even if the internet sales are growing fast, investors will always penalize a legacy retailer trying to grow internet sales versus a pure online retailer like Chewy."
04/05/2021,stocks,every stock is not a short squeez
04/05/2021,stocks,It won’t compete with Petsmart/Chewy.
04/05/2021,stocks,"WOOF and CHWY and the like have come up before: https://old.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/let9wd/chewy_dd_insight_from_a_vet/

Here's what I wrote there about WOOF (I own both WOOF and CHWY now, and like both online experiences and the in store pickup option for Petco). And this was before most recent earnigs, which showed doubling of online sales revenue for WOOF. The pickup in store option is gaining a lot of traction, too. 

Also, I'd ignore the anecdotal reports of ""ew, Petco"" in the thread. Hundreds of stores. Hundreds of employees. Hard to deliver uniform in person experience, but Petco is working on it. Look at the numbers, particularly when it comes to the valuation as well as potential as ""stay at home/covid play"" pegged vs ""reopening brick and mortar"" pegged. I like the underdog.

> ""I like CHWY a lot. But I wouldn't recommend it right now. Valuations do matter. 

> WOOF is priced at around an eight of what CHWY is by price to sales. Contrary to popular belief, it also has a website that's pretty good, physical storefronts that continue to do well, and both grooming and vet services in house, something CHWY cannot have by nature of its model. Same day pickup for me is better than getting something shipped, especially heavy stuff like dog food. Not good for planet, and often I want or need it now, particularly with meds and some specific dog thing. WOOF has been leaning into this, as has Target, to great results.

> If you're investing for growth and management, CHWY makes sense. But at this point, unless they expand overseas or something, I can't justify its valuation, in comparison to that of WOOF anyway. I also like Petco's management -- good appearance on CNBC and excellent omnichannel strategy execution so far."
04/05/2021,stocks,Yes pet smart owns Chewy
04/05/2021,stocks,"I'm watching it, but holding off. This is one company I want to see earning from before I think about investing too much. In the comments you can see some people say the store sucks, and others say the one near them is great. These are things that need to be known to be honest. Just watching for now."
04/05/2021,stocks,"I do all my shopping at Chewy... but I recently went into a Petco because I was forgetful in ordering food and went in to grab a small bag since I needed it asap.   


I was pleasantly surprised by the selection, cleanliness and inviting atmosphere of that particular store. They price matched Chewy as well so I had no complaints.   


As mentioned, I won't really shop there (Chewy is #1) often, but I wouldn't hesitate dropping in again if I need a brick & mortar pet store."
04/05/2021,stocks,"Heavy shorts don’t indicate a short squeeze, they indicate it will fall. Only overly shorted can squeeze."
04/05/2021,stocks,Chewy and Amazon are taking over. Lol
04/05/2021,stocks,"All I know is I work for a non-petco pet store... the petco closest to us just closed. I’ve never gone into a petco and seen it busy or “slammed” as I’ve seen it at my own store. 

Sure they benefited from the pandemic pet boom, like basically every other pet retailer. Unsure if this trend will continue. They have good things and bad things like any company. Pretty much every company’s online sales have gone up from the pandemic, that doesn’t mean a lasting trend."
04/05/2021,stocks,Pet supplies plus is kicking thier ass.
04/05/2021,stocks,"I just bought 25 shares today at $21. This stock is overlooked by the market. They've got a lot going for them. Good e-commerce, lots of brick and mortar locations, and future plans for expansion into health care services. Really big upsides here."
04/05/2021,stocks,I’m small potatoes but I like the company. The new whole pet mentality is a good one.
04/05/2021,stocks,"Logically, they should grow as more millenials get pets and spend money on them, but I find all the small animals in cages depressing everytime I go. They also just charge more than target and Amazon for the same stuff"
04/05/2021,stocks,Chewy by Cohen
04/05/2021,stocks,"I hate my local petco. There’s always a long line, everything is ridiculously expensive, the people that work there are polite but condescending 18 yr olds who feel some sort of animal knowledge superiority. I’ve seen too many horror stories to use their grooming services. Twice while vacationing in FL, the petco there couldn’t ring me up because their computers were down."
04/05/2021,stocks,"Idk chewey has a lot more potetional for growth
Petcos changes are just an attempt to survive, they will never beat Amazon's speed or cheweys prices"
04/05/2021,stocks,Oh I saw an ad for them last week yeah they're trying to pivot into some kinda weird territory ad was forgettable so I can't remember what it was but didn't sound plausible iirc
04/05/2021,stocks,"PetCo has a lot of Chinese made things which Americans are wanting less and less, they want american made 

Also, they used to exclusively have Blue Buffalo and other high end cat and dog food brands, but that’s just not the case anymore.

those same high end food brands, at least some of them, are in big box stores such as Walmart now, and for lower prices"
04/05/2021,stocks,"Nah bro fuck petco heres my story.

When i was like 8 or something there was this show called ""out of the box"" they would jump into this box and it was a huge clubhouse.

I was going to build my own.

Behind the apartments i lived in was a little strip mall that had a pet co in it.

I went to the dumpsters to get some boxes and i pull out a box that is heavy open it up and tied up in a ppastic bag are three LIVING KITTENS. I go get my mom and shit and shes taking care of that but im a kid and want a fucking bix fort so i go grab another box. Kind of heavy. Bunch of living lizards in there.

Pet co throws away fucking living animals tied up in bags hidden in boxes."
04/05/2021,stocks,Serious question—how do you find out how much a company is being shorted?
04/05/2021,stocks,"The main benefit I see to Petco over Chewy/Walmart is that Petco is expanding the inclusion of Thrive vets in their stores. Thrive is much cheaper than other vet services, which expands their pharmacy capabilities as well."
04/05/2021,stocks,"PetCo is a Hood company, AMA about their shit aquatics dept (livestock or dry goods)."
04/05/2021,stocks,"Petco and for that matter Petsmart as well charge more for the exact same food and toys you can now get from other local and big box stores or online. Pet owners have known this for years. I don’t see them improving anytime soon because theirs b&m stores, high prices for the same products, and awe full customer service hasn’t changed in decades."
04/05/2021,stocks,"> and just recently cut out raw hides from their stores.

Is this supposed to be a good thing or a bad thing?"
04/05/2021,stocks,Debt load from the original LBO is going to crush it. They were always the second tier pet supply place and simply from their CEO stating that no one does what they are doing with e-commerce and the rest of the jargon (when CNBC had him on during the IPO) I wouldn’t touch the stock with a 10 ft pole and only thing I want to do is buy puts
04/05/2021,stocks,[deleted]
04/05/2021,stocks,I guess it’s all about location. The petco around me is great. Just got renovated and is clean. They even have self check out machines at ours. too. Never seen anything like it. They are doing a remodeling of stores. You shouldn’t be too far behind.
04/05/2021,stocks,Thats the feeling I get going into petsmart... petco is always active and bright with good items
04/05/2021,stocks,Your way off! Petco is thriving..even more then ever before. Lots of people in south Florida support Petco and will spend a few more pennies rather than go to Wal-Mart these days for old product.
04/05/2021,stocks,Huh mine is in the same kind of area and the store is great and usually busy
04/05/2021,stocks,Petco They just reduced their debt by %49 and their digital sales grew %90... Chewy at 33 billion market value I would say is a little more overvalued. Petco has huge potential and upside in my opinion. Next earnings will be very interesting. But I like the direction they are headed.
04/05/2021,stocks,Tractor supply is amazing. I bought pine litter in bulk and they delivered in one day for $20 more and it still ended up being cheaper than chewy.
04/05/2021,stocks,Quick thought on Tractor Supply?
04/05/2021,stocks,[deleted]
04/05/2021,stocks,"You must be from California, huh?"
04/05/2021,stocks,"I know , I was just surprised to see a company like petco so shorted that’s all."
04/05/2021,stocks,Maybe they should finish Artifact Foundry before making another game.
04/05/2021,stocks,"PetCo and PetSmart have different owners, or they did the last time I checked"
04/05/2021,stocks,So also shorting there stock would be a solid play here
04/05/2021,stocks,"It really is and people spending money on their pets isn’t going anywhere. People like their pets, more than they like other people. FACT."
04/05/2021,stocks,"This is pretty close to my PetCo experience as well.
They are understaffed to save $, I get it, but nearly half the time I go to check out, the 1 cashier builds a line 8 people long and every transaction takes fucking forever, especially since they are encouraged to talk about your pet shit (which would be fine if they EVER has enough people on register)

Had the PC system go down a handful of times as well.

It's very hard to believe in this company from my experience in their stores."
04/05/2021,stocks,"I would be curious to do a comparison on the amount of china based products being sold in Petsmart, Chewy, Petco and other big brand pet suppliers. That would be interesting."
04/05/2021,stocks,lol
04/05/2021,stocks,AYA uh? How bad was it over there homie
04/05/2021,stocks,"As a pet owner, I'm a very loyal customer of Chewy.   


They have insanely good customer service. They sent me (by surprise) a hand painted portrait of my dog. Shipping is ultra fast and selection is fantastic. I had issues with an order and they refunded instantly no questions asked. They are big on customer retention.   


I'll buy pet supplies from them forever unless they change something."
04/05/2021,stocks,That same CEO has helped double online sales this past quarter. Please do short
04/05/2021,stocks,Petsmart owns 63% of chewy not pet co?
04/05/2021,stocks,"It maybe...Their earning were above expectations and their website is set up exactly like chewy. If they could possibly take over a company like Bark box or create something like that, I think they could really start doing some great things. I like the ceo’s vision for the company in health and wellness."
04/05/2021,stocks,"The PetCo close by me is one of the most popular/profitable in the U.S.

They have setting up to be remodeled for years - hasn't happened.

I admittedly haven't done a deep dive on their financials, but because of my line of work have had a pretty close knowledge/relationship with one of their stores..and it's shit.

The stores themselves are aesthetically pretty depressing. They do stock dog food and overpriced pet toys (where I assume they make their money) but the other sectors  (small animals - Aquatics especially) aren't very good.

And for real, overpriced as shit, and not just cheapely made toys, their Aquatics equipment is like half their own house brand that is ineffective and the rest like 2x + prices of Chewy and Amazon.

PetCo by me feels like it is being propped up by people that either don't know what the internet is, or are otherwise financially unable to properly utilize an online ecosystem or better local pet store.

They can talk online sales increase and ""pet services"" by why in the hell choose PetCo for that? From ALL the PetCos I've ever visited, they hire nice folks, but for the most part, not super skilled at all - some have absolutely no idea about their store ""specialities"".

You really trust PetCo to do grooming/nails/dog training/online sales compared to Chewy/Amazon/Local stores?

Also, they are cheap as a company, regarding pay and equipment, and customer service sucks and employees look exhausted.

Also, don't buy your fish/inverts/corals from there."
04/05/2021,stocks,I'll definitely take another look if they remodel.
04/05/2021,stocks,Yea mine looks clean and brand new. Every time I go in there’s people
04/05/2021,stocks,"Just my thoughts about the one store near me.  We ended up getting the items for our new puppy on Amazon. For around the price of one wire crate at Petco (\~$120) we got a wire crate, dog bed, leash, collar, poop bags, and food bowls.  All about the same level of quality offered at Petco."
04/05/2021,stocks,"Me personally, I’m not looking at the most expensive stocks in a sector to determine if something is undervalued.

I’m not buying Chewy either, but I can see the appeal because all growth for them is growth, with online margins. Petco meanwhile may have done 90% growth online, but what of that was at the expense of existing brick and mortar? Moving buyers online is beneficial, but less so if they aren’t also downsizing their physical footprint to reduce cost. That’s a tricky balance.

You seem to have your mind made up it’s a good investment based on other comments, I hope it pays off for you, just doesn’t look appealing to me."
04/05/2021,stocks,The difference is that chewy is thriving
04/05/2021,stocks,"I own the stock so of course I like it. I like to store even more, I got my ducks and get my poultry feed there."
04/05/2021,stocks,">Chewy’s horrendous customer service 

What?!  Chewy's customer service is best in class. It's one of the primary drivers of them taking on Amazon."
04/05/2021,stocks,"I have never heard anybody say anything bad about Chewy's customer service until reading your post. It is the complete opposite of that. I hear nothing but constant praise for Chewy's customer service. Their customer service is one of the things that people love most about Chewy and why Amazon can't stop them.

Maybe you were unlucky to have a rare bad experience with Chewy, but that is definitely not most people's experience with Chewy. Of all the companies that I can think of, Chewy is probably one of the top 5 when it comes to customers just loving their customer service."
04/05/2021,stocks,I think chewy has the best customer service of any company i have dealt with - your experience seems to be the outlier
04/05/2021,stocks,"charts dont lie, if buyers saw potential then the chart would prove it imo"
04/05/2021,stocks,Petco is petco and Petsmart owns chewy.
04/05/2021,stocks,In my experience Chewy’s customer service was far from Exceptional.. And Taking on Amazon? You have 2 much time on your hands.
04/05/2021,stocks,"People suck, my pets rock.  Multiply that mentality out by a few million and you've got some real earnings."
04/05/2021,stocks,"I get that people spending more money on their pets isn't going away, but is that trend going towards more money at PetCo vs other better pet stores?

I mean, what I see is regular folks having less kids and spending more on pets and more affluent people spending even more money on pet shit, but neither of those shopping at PetCo."
04/05/2021,stocks,It would because this guys' post is just so inaccurate. Must like to feel included. You can only listen to a few here on Reddit.
04/05/2021,stocks,"Generally just bad. The equipment used to maintain the welfare of the fish is inadequate for the numbers of fish kept. And generally speaking as well, the employees aren't really trained/knowledgeable enough to adequately care for the livestock.

There is a lot of death at even the best PetCo stores. Far far more than any local fish store or online fish retailer. They mostly sell a lot of freshwater fish (because saltwater fish deaths are far costlier) and even then they almost never look good, health/color wise. BUT, the one near me is actually busy, but thate leads to dead fish sitting around in tanks.

Can never purchase saltwater fish from them, because the tanks are full of ich, and you risk getting that into your system at home. Really, I imagine the aquatics section is really a just a convenient way for you to buy other overpriced aquatics dry goods from the store."
04/05/2021,stocks,"Your reasoning is because he doubled online sales? Look, firstly I said puts, not shorting anything... it's called risk management. Secondly, there are plenty of companies that are public that shouldn't be. 

I'm just stating that they were taken private in an LBO so they're laden with debt, aren't best of breed in the area, have no real moat with Petsmart (private) and Chewy doing just fine. If you want to put your money in, cool, but in the long term there are MANY other places that are better for your investment"
04/05/2021,stocks,definitely misread that! you are correct
04/05/2021,stocks,">Also, don't buy your fish/inverts/corals from there.

All big box stores that sell aquarium fish do it completely wrong. I feel like I'm witnessing a slow mass murder whenever I walk by a Walmart, Petsmart, Petco fish section.

As someone whose first job was cleaning aquariums at McDonalds then working in  aquarium shops, don't buy these creatures at anything but a specialty store or trusted dealer. Sadly, decent aquarium shops can be hard to find.

I need to scrounge up the investment capital to install myself on their boards and fix their fish sections."
04/05/2021,stocks,"Not 100% related but I wouldn't trust buying anything for an animal on Amazon, besides toys. No telling what you're gonna get."
04/05/2021,stocks,"Petco's here had the same depressing Kmart feeling and high prices. I haven't been back much, but the one closest to me is renovating and re-arranging the store. An anecdote that supports OP's thesis."
04/05/2021,stocks,In my experience Chewy’s customer service was FAR from Exceptional.. And Taking on Amazon? You have 2 much time on your hands.
04/05/2021,stocks,"Yeah, Petco had another bad day on the market. It has a lot to prove to me personally."
04/05/2021,stocks,I’ve never had anything but exceptional service from chewy....maybe look inward at the problem?
04/05/2021,stocks,"You've lost me here. Chewys customer service has been exceptional for me, consistently. They even send out little 'Best Wishes' cards a few weeks after I order medication for my cats. 

This reeks of pump and dump."
04/05/2021,stocks,yesssssir!!!
04/05/2021,stocks,"I think the recent IPO, the recent statement from the company on their new direction and the remodeling of their online space, stores, and focus on whole pet health is going to grow their market share. 

Like I said earlier, my position is tiny but I do like the company and I do think they will grow. It’s a drastically different mentality than they had a few years ago and I think for the better."
04/05/2021,stocks,What kind of McDonald’s did you work at that had an aquarium  ?!?
04/05/2021,stocks,"Yes, you are totally correct.

Buy local or from trusted online retailers. (Hopefully) in the future, the treatment of aquatic livestock by these stores will be seen as animal abuse.

Fish, at least at several enormous shipping  companies in the U.S. still don't have adequate provisions as animal cargo and are still tossed around as well :(

Edit - if you scrounge up that capital we can do our own fish thing ;)"
04/05/2021,stocks,"Yeah, you're right. Amazon isn't very good for a lot of aquatics products either."
04/05/2021,stocks,"That's your experience though. There are more experiences than purely your own. 

With saying that when I lived near a petco I liked it. Now I live near a petsmart. Much the same but petco felt better. 

Now I just buy what I need off chewy and save the trip."
04/05/2021,stocks,Lol - You are the one on Reddit getting into the depths of customer service about a company that is utterly regarded as having great customer service...  🪞
04/05/2021,stocks,"Dude what are you talking about lol, that's at least one reason people hype Chewy is b/c they did take on Amazon in a particular space, and came out ahead."
04/05/2021,stocks,"They are literally known as the only company to roll amazon.

Also known for insanely good customer service. Incredible experiences so far for us"
04/05/2021,stocks,I would agree. Chewy's customer service is absolutely fantastic. Refund/exchanges no problem or questions asked.
04/05/2021,stocks,Isn't Chewy's exceptional customer service literally an officially recognised moat in SEC filings?
04/05/2021,stocks,"I gotcha. I mean that would be great if they can do that, I just def consider this a turnaround play, tons of shit would need to change.

Thanks for your input.

Edit - Also, have they stated anything about vision for aquatics dept.? 

It's also worrying to me that they are talking about future online sales, but they bought, didn't manage to do anything productive with, LiveAquaria.com and then sold it."
04/05/2021,stocks,The kind built in the 80's.
04/05/2021,stocks,"I worked for the guy contracted to clean these aquariums. All the piedmont cities in NC- Greensboro, Winston Salem, High Point, Burlington. Think we cleaned for ~10 stores, probably just one or two franchisee owners."
04/05/2021,stocks,"Exactly, And that’s all it was (In my experience). Never denied that. It’s all about convenience"
04/05/2021,stocks,You should definitely do your DD before you publicly comment on Reddit
04/05/2021,stocks,"Yeah I don’t see it as a fast play for sure. It’s a ~5+ year play for me. 

I haven’t seen anything specific to aquatics."
04/05/2021,stocks,That's wild

Plenty of healthcare decisions can't be determined virtually also, or is completely useless. An example would be pretty much all surgical cases. Its not hard to tell if someone has a cavity on an x-ray. Its pretty hard to figure out how to remove the decay and place a filling virtually (if thats possible at all).

Plenty of healthcare decisions need to be made person to person. Is that lesion raised? Flat? Does it smell? Is it pus filled and squishy or is it hard and firm?"
04/05/2021,stocks,"The why is because it’s a hard stock to value right now. Was it a COVID stock, yes. Was telehealth growing before, and will continue to grow after, also yes. TDOC gave fairly light new member growth projections for 2021, which is the simplest way to identify growth, and it’s hard to forecast short/medium term usage numbers given the uncertainty of how people respond to the “new normal”. 

Add in the still relative newness of merging in Livongo and it’s almost impossible to identify what their earnings mix will look like. As others have said, TDOC still has fantastic long term prospects, but fact is it’s likely going to be under appreciated for a while yet because investing in telehealth on the COVID downtrend isn’t sexy. They’ll probably need a few reports to give the market clarity and maintain direction."

From a non-DCF standpoint, no one knows if tdoc is going to continue growing like it did during the pandemic. Growth rates will greatly affect the valuation on a shorter term basis."

2021-04-05 19:59:06,stocks,"My attempt at a 50K portfolio allocation I've been a day-trader and option market trader for approximately 7 years. Honestly my previous year record as a swing/day trader was very poor, and so I educated myself about trading options and spreads in particular. This year alone I've done almost $40K in profit, and I've enhanced my technical, fundamental and macro analysis to make decisions on whether to go long/short etc and then initiated vertical spreads from there. (30-45 DTE)

Having said that, I'm thinking about finally creating my own portfolio. I've never done this, despite having a finance background.

My goals are quite simple: 1) Set a sector weight cap limit for each sector, so that if there's a breach, I sell some stock and bring it down. Also setting a ""stock"" weight limit, etc. So I'll be watching those carefully and then I'll know when to take profits or rebalance my positions.

[Stock Portfolio](https://ibb.co/n7bqn9H)

This is just a sample portfolio, and I'm going to do more research on the names... But I'm just wondering is 16 stocks too much for $50K? Should I increase the Value per stock to $5K instead of $2.5K?

Ideally, I'd like to generate a dividend yield of near 3-4% per year, while getting between 5-10% per year on my portfolio. Again, I have to assess my portfolio for these characteristics, but for now that's the plan.

Q1) What are your thoughts on my portfolio structure so far?

Q2) Should I decrease my sample size? What would you recommend if so.

Q3) What are your thoughts on the sector allocation? Too many sectors?

Also feel free to recommend some stocks in the sectors that you're familiar with, and any other advice. I'm honestly doing very well with the Spreads and I want to continue doing it, but I'm also aware that I could return to my old losing habits."

That's the cigar-butt-strategy, that's not a goal. But why the focus on sectors? And why would you sell a company when you made a profit? I mean, if Apple announces new iPhones and iMacs and MacBooks, they report that their sales doubled in the last year, increased their profit margin and the dividend payout, and so on, selling for the sake of rebalancing doesn't sound like the best idea?

&#x200B;

Dividend yield: You should also check the dividend history. Lots of companies don't pay a dividend or pay a smaller amount when they had a bad year. Some don't. And getting dividend when the markets are down to average down is also great...

> This is just a sample portfolio, and I'm going to do more research on  the names... But I'm just wondering is 16 stocks too much for $50K?  Should I increase the Value per stock to $5K instead of $2.5K? 

Well, personally I think 16 is too much, but that also depends on the company. You could buy Apple and probably forget about them for the next 5-10 years. But when you buy AMD now, you maybe have to check what for instance Intel is doing, what CPUs smart phone manufacturers are ordering, and so on.

&#x200B;

Q1) 

Why oil? Oil prices are cyclical and can be very volatile ... and imho clean tech is a better long term investment.

Why four tech companies? Why do you think those four listed will make you more money than for instance Nvidia or Microsoft?

Q2) Well, you don't have to start with 16... If you want to research thoroughly: the annual report of one of my companies is 178 pages long. With \~4 competitors, times 16, that's 14k pages. You know, you can also start with 4 companies and 1/3 of your available money. 

Q3) I wouldn't focus on sectors. I mean, just imagine you picked 10 companies that you like, that are in a really good financial position, growth predictions look wonderful. Now you miss a position in a sector and you have to find a company just for the sake of having a position in that sector. What if you can't find one with the same or better outlook? Just buy a company for the sake of having a position in a sector, even though you're sure, it won't perform as well as the companies that are already owned by you?"

Is your finance background in stocks/investing? 


What’s the point of shooting for 3-4% in dividends? If you’re from finance them I’m sure you’re aware of the paper “Dividend Policy, Growth, And The Value Of Shares” by Miller and _____(I don’t know how to spell the second guy’s name). 


IMO it seems like you’re approaching stocks the way a trader/novice would. “Make ____ much money by ____.”  Which we all know stocks don’t work like that. 


If you want the best return, there’s tons of data showing the simple index fund is the way to go. 


> Q1) What are your thoughts on my portfolio structure so far?


Seems like you put a lot of thought into it. 


> Q3) What are your thoughts on the sector allocation? Too many sectors?


I think you should do a basic index fund portfolio and allocate 20% to be towards individual stocks. For that 20%, invest in what you know and what you deem to be undervalued. 


> Also feel free to recommend some stocks in the sectors that you're familiar with, 


This is your money. Invest in stuff **you** know. Who cares what I’m familiar with.

2021-04-05 19:16:39,stocks,"Reasons to be Bullish about Novavax (NVAX) I have been following NVAX for a while and think that it will be the big winner at the end of all this COVID stuff. I found an excellent writeup/summary which touched all the important points and thought it would be useful here, which I'll summarize below.

[https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5edc0eff6a4d6a35f30f4869/t/606805acba16b241de2b06be/1617429937628/NOVAVAX+-+An+Overview.pdf](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5edc0eff6a4d6a35f30f4869/t/606805acba16b241de2b06be/1617429937628/NOVAVAX+-+An+Overview.pdf)

**Novavax's vaccine is crazy effective, cheap to make, and easy to transport.**

""The way Novavax’ vaccine works is different even from the ones previously mentioned and approved for use in the United States. NVX-CoV2373 (the formal name for their vaccine) is a protein-based subunit vaccine candidate engineered from the genetic sequence of SARS-CoV-2. The vaccine was created using Novavax’ recombinant nanoparticle technology to generate antigens derived from the coronavirus spike (S) protein. It is adjuvanted 4 with Novavax’ patented saponin-based Matrix-MTM which enhances the immune response and stimulates high levels of neutralizing antibodies. This vaccine candidate does require two doses, spaced three weeks apart. ""

"" Second-generation vaccines, of which Novavax is one, are identified based on their potential to provide protection with a single dose, exhibit stability in greater temperature ranges, remain stable throughout the manufacturing process, yield an improved or differentiated immune response, and use a diverse range of antigens. They are historically cheaper and have had higher levels of efficacy and safety. ""

**They already have over a 200 million orders and they have a worldwide supply chain and distribution already set up.**

""To date, Novavax has increased its projected global manufacturing production rate of NVX-CoV2373 to be over two billion annualized doses when they’re at full capacity, which is expected to occur in mid-2021. Of this anticipated capacity, approximately one billion doses will be manufactured by the Serum Institute of India Private Limited (SIIPL). Novavax has developed partnerships with entities across the globe to increase its manufacturing capacity and vaccine supplies ""

""Novavax has entered into advanced purchase agreements with various countries globally that, if the vaccine is approved, are expected to result in the delivery of approximately 200 million doses of NVX-CoV2373 throughout 2021 and into the first half of 2022 ""

**It looks like coronavirus is not going away, so people will continue to need boosters and shots to take care of the variant strains.**

""From what I’ve learned about Novavax, they seem to be well-positioned to give COVID-19 the knockout punch. Their underlying recombinant nanoparticle technology has the ability to accurately target viral pathogens and create protein antigens organized around a polysorbate-based nanoparticle core, the assembly of which resembles the native presentation of the pathogen being targeted. This process creates highly-immunogenic, long-lasting, yet safe, vaccines that can tackle not only COVID-19 and its variant strains, but also a wide variety of other disease organisms. One of Novavax’ near-term clinical development work is evaluating the viability of certain combination vaccines, which, if successful, could potentially lead to a seasonal 3-in-1 or 2-in-1 vaccine shot that would take care of influenza, COVID-19, and RSV ""

TLDR: Honestly, no company has the combination of (1) 90%+ efficacy, (2) easy transport and storage, and (3) easy modification like Novavax does. I think this vaccine, along with Pfizer/BioNTech (which I owned last year) will end up the big winner from all this. Moderna is behind Pfizer, AstraZeneca is an absolute mess (the clots appear to be real), and Johnson & Johnson is simply not all that effective.

Price targets on eTrade on average are $323, that's 74% upside. Catalysts coming in April (UK) and May (US). Obviously, all vaccine plays carry risk, but there's no logical reason for the recent downward pressure on NVAX's price. It's part of my well-diversified portfolio. 

Position: 50 shares."

04/05/2021,stocks,"I like NVAX, but one thing to be aware of is that their vaccine is less effective against the South African “EEK” variant (60%) than Pfizer (90%). Also, MRNA vaccines are much easier to update. Not to say that NVAX won’t be successful, but there is some level of competitive disadvantage there. 

Aside from Pfizer and Moderna, I think Nvax is far better than all the others."

Has been a roller coaster but I'm sure it'll pay me off big time in the end. The world is overestimating how COVID won't be a thing of the past after the vaccine, and I want to be patient enough to bank on that overestimation."

04/05/2021,stocks,"It’s worth considering that the JNJ vaccine study was done at a different time to PFE, and JNJ also involved other countries in the study whilst PFE kept it mostly in the US. The exposure to other countries meant other strains that may have been more resistant to the vaccine likely meant that JNJ appeared to be less efficacious.

In my opinion, the JNJ results are more accurate, rather than less impressive.

About $GLSI

&#x200B;

Greenwich LifeSciences (Nasdaq: GLSI) is a public clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of an immunotherapy to prevent breast cancer recurrences in patients who have previously undergone surgery, that is developing GP2, a novel peptide immunotherapy, and is planning to commence a Phase III clinical trial ([https://greenwichlifesciences.com](https://greenwichlifesciences.com)).

GP2 is derived from the HER2/neu protein, which is expressed in a variety of common cancers, including breast cancer.  Tumors with elevated expression of HER2/neu protein are highly aggressive, resulting in an increased disease recurrence and a worse prognosis.  In a Phase IIb clinical trial in the HER2/neu 3+ adjuvant setting, no breast cancer recurrences were observed after median 5 years of follow-up if the patient was fully immunized.  In addition, GP2 treatment is well tolerated and no serious adverse events related to GP2 immunotherapy were reported.

&#x200B;

Upcoming Potential Catalysts for 2021

April 9-10- Greenwich is to announces more GP2 data on at the AACR (American Association for Cancer Research) annual meeting, where the company will release the final 5-year immune response results from its Phase IIb trial ([https://investor.greenwichlifesciences.com/news-events/ir-calendar/detail/7476/american-association-for-cancer-research-aacr-annual](https://investor.greenwichlifesciences.com/news-events/ir-calendar/detail/7476/american-association-for-cancer-research-aacr-annual)).

The AACR plans to publish two Greenwich LifeSciences abstracts on April 9, 2021 at 12:01 am EST and posters on April 10, 2021 on its Phase IIb clinical trial's final five year immune response data and its planned Phase III clinical trial updated design.

Obviously I can’t predict the future, but  I hypothesize- determinate on the outcome of the results- that price action will be fire in the premarket and could start as early as 04:00:01 est. For that reason I am planning to set a GTC, extended hours, limit order the night before (04/08) with a lofty price target as things can get crazy in the premarket with low volume and high volatility. 

Planned Phase III Trial: 9 amino acid HER2/neu peptide + GM-CSF immunotherapy for breast cancer in adjuvant/neoadjuvant setting (postsurgery) in HER2/neu 3+, HLA-A2 patients in Y2 following Herceptin or Kadcyla. 

You can see the clinical trial design here: [https://greenwichlifesciences.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GLSI-SABCS-2020-GP2-Phase-III-OT-13-03-Poster.pdf](https://greenwichlifesciences.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GLSI-SABCS-2020-GP2-Phase-III-OT-13-03-Poster.pdf)

Breast Cancer

I’m not going to go into an overview of what breast cancer is, if you want to know more->[https://lmgtfy.app/?q=what+is+breast+cancer%3F](https://lmgtfy.app/?q=what+is+breast+cancer%3F). But here are some easily digestible facts to illustrate it’s likelihood, frequency, and most importantly the unmet need for improved treatment

One in eight U.S. women will develop invasive breast cancer over her lifetime, with approximately 266,000 new breast cancer patients and 3.1 million breast cancer survivors in 2018, all of whom have the potential to experience breast cancer recurrences (Source: American Cancer Society).

HER2/neu 3+ (“HER2-positive”) breast cancer patients comprise approximately 25% of all breast cancer patients (Source: American Society of Clinical Oncology).

For women in the U.S., breast cancer death rates are higher than those for any other cancer, besides lung cancer.

Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among American women. In 2021, it's estimated that about 30% of newly diagnosed cancers in women will be breast cancers.

Breast cancer became the most common cancer globally as of 2021, accounting for 12% of all new annual cancer cases worldwide, according to the World Health Organization.

About 85% of breast cancers occur in women who have no family history of breast cancer. These occur due to genetic mutations that happen as a result of the aging process and life in general, rather than inherited mutations.

The most significant risk factors for breast cancer are sex (being a woman) and age (growing older).

This is significant because these are not factors one can necessarily change, as opposed to being able to reduce your risk for lung cancer by not smoking, avoiding radiation, and radon, etc.

&#x200B;

So what does that mean?

$GLSI isn’t trying to replace current therapies, but work in tangent with them and is designed to be compatible with future derivatives:

		“GP2 can be the treatment that will naturally overlap with or follow Herceptin, Kadcyla, or Enhertu or any of the other Herceptin derivatives being developed” (pg. 6)

&#x200B;

So the way I see this, GLSI isn’t trying to come into the marketplace as a competitor to the current treatment options available (which would be a much harder pitch to doctors who are currently using Herceptin, Kadcyla, or Enhertu) but as a supplementary treatment. 

&#x200B;

“GP2 & GM-CSF starting in Year 2 act synergistically with Herceptin to prevent cancer recurrences, if fully immunized, reducing recurrence rates from 11% to 0% at median 5 years follow-up (p = 0.0338), with minimal to no side effects & no SAEs.”

“In the initial GP2 indication, approximately 17,000 new patients could be treated per year, saving up to 1,500 to 2,000 lives per year.” (pg4)

Side note: notice that the quote above didn’t really need to be said; and definitely not included in a presentation of clinical data (presumably every doctor scrutinizing the results can do simple math). As an investor, this is one of the many things that make me very bullish about GLSI. A company could get fantastic clinical results but as the average investor doesn’t know how to interpret the results, if the company doesn’t present them in an easily digestible form, many investors will (rightfully so) pass on trading that position.  And GLSI does that. You don’t even need a GED to open their PR, see “0% recurrence of breast cancer in 96 patients over 5 years” and “results indicate  GP2 could save up to 1,500 to 2,000 lives per year” to know that is great news and hop in a position trading on that news. More people trading => more volume, and on a low float stock like GLSI (2.69M shares according to yahfin) it will not take much to get the share price moving. If GLSI comes out and shows that the rest of their data is as good as their top-line, it will be a very profitable day for trading. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Instead of cancer, imagine GLSI was focusing on migraines and their medicine gets FDA approved. Now why would the doctor prescribe GLSI over some other company that he has been prescribing for years and years he knows works fairly well (so harder to get into the marketplace = less sales = less revenue)? Not to mention the doctor’s probably got connections and fiscal incentives already connected to the current treatment options, so again there would be less incentive to prescribe GLSI. 

But what if you went to the doctor’s with a migraine, got treated for your migraine using your doctor’s preferred treatment options (so he’s still happy) and then as a patient was provided with an option to take a booster pill. The doctor tells you, so far about 100 people have taken the booster pill and NONE of them have had ANY migraines in the 5 years since taking it. On top of that, there have been little to NO side effects after taking the booster pill.  So would you take the booster pill to safely and effectively eliminate the possibilities of a migraine every coming back (or at least, for the next 5+ years)?

Now replace migraine with breast cancer, and that booster pill is $GLSI 

&#x200B;

Breast cancer (ALL cancer) is extremely scary, I don’t even pretend to know what kind of impact that diagnosis  can have on one’s life. I am apart of a family who has been horribly affected by cancer and I know we would do anything to prevent having to relive that experience nightmare. And as breast cancer is the number 1 common cancer globally, I know my family is not alone in this feeling of desperation.

Additional Details

4 clinical trials. 138 treated breast cancer patients. ​

No cancer recurrences if fully immunized.  No reported serious adverse events.  Well tolerated safety profile.

Thus far, the safety and efficacy of the GP2 immunotherapy have been tested in four clinical trials, where 138 patients have received treatment to date. The past trials consist of three Phase I clinical trials and one Phase IIb clinical trial. 

In a prospective, randomized, single-blinded, placebo-controlled, multi-center (16 sites) Phase IIb clinical trial led by MD Anderson and completed in 2018, no recurrences were observed in the HER2/neu 3+ adjuvant setting after median 5 years of follow-up if the patient was fully immunized with GP2 (p = 0.0338). 

Full immunization was received in the Primary Immunization Series (PIS), which included the first 6 GP2 + GM-CSF intradermal injections over the first 6 months.  The PIS elicited a potent immune response as measured by local skin tests and immunological assays.  Further, booster injections given every 6 months prolonged the immune response, thereby providing longer term protection.  In the Phase IIb and three Phase I clinical trials, there were no reported serious adverse events related to the GP2 immunotherapy. 

89 patients treated with GP2 + GM-CSF, 91 placebo patients treated with GM-CSF

17 patients treated with GP2 + GM-CSF + trastuzumab

14 patients treated with GP2 + AE37 + GM-CSF

18 patients treated with GP2 + GM-CSF

Top performing IPO in 2020 ([https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/this-was-the-top-performing-ipo-in-2020-2020-12-28](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/this-was-the-top-performing-ipo-in-2020-2020-12-28)).

On December 8, 2020, GLSI share price closed at $5.20 per share. Then GLSI published its 5-year breast cancer data from a Phase IIb trial on December 9, which showed 0% breast cancer recurrences over 5 years of follow-up. On that day, the company's stock spiked to $158 per share and closed at $57 per share, surging the next day to $128 per share and closing at $72 per share. 

This shows huge (positive) market sentiment towards the data and it is reasonable to assume the market will react similarly on similar news. Perhaps even stronger since this data set will be the complete results. 

The company experienced another spike in share price on March 8, 2021, opening at $23 per share, spiking at $53 per share, before finally closing at $37 per share when it was announced that Dr. Jaye Thompson would be brought on full time to lead the GP2 Phase III trial in the fight against breast cancer. 

A 130% increase in share price just on the news of HIRING someone for phase III shows the market is still very much interested in Greenwich’s GP2 trial.

Greenwich LifeSciences Announces Option Agreement for Pre-clinical Coronavirus Vaccine Candidates

“Snehal Patel, CEO of Greenwich LifeSciences, commented, “While we are focused on the upcoming GP2 Phase III breast cancer clinical trial, and are also exploring how to expand the use of GP2 in additional indications through supplemental clinical trials, we have decided to explore the addition of new immunotherapy product candidates to our pipeline at both the pre-clinical and clinical stages of development. The objective of the coronavirus vaccine program is to leverage the development team’s experience in achieving 100% protection against lethal levels of pneumonic plague infection to increase the percent protection and duration of protection of coronavirus vaccines under development. It is not clear how long one will be protected by the current Covid-19 vaccines and none that have been developed to date offer 100% protection. We are hopeful that our approach, which showed 100% protection against pneumonic plague, may lead to greater and longer lasting protection compared to existing Covid-19 vaccines under development.”” [https://investor.greenwichlifesciences.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/23/for-pre-clinical-coronavirus-vaccine-candidates](https://investor.greenwichlifesciences.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/23/for-pre-clinical-coronavirus-vaccine-candidates)

Personally- is this a reason to buy GLSI? No. Is this a reason to hold GLSI? No. Is this bad news for GLSI? Absolutely not. This holds no impact in my position of GLSI. It is definitely bullish news.

Cash

 As of December 31st, 2020,

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

In September 2020, the Company completed its initial public offering and raised $7,250,002 in gross proceeds and $6,207,502 in net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses. In December 2020, the Company completed a follow-on offering and raised $26,400,000 in gross proceeds and $23,959,000 in net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses. The Company met and exceeded those predictions thus mitigating any substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern as defined by ASU 2014-05 and its ability to satisfy the estimated liquidity needs for the twelve months from the issuance of the financial statements.

&#x200B;

As of December 31, 2020, the Company had cash of $28,660,375.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

There’s never anything wrong with securing profits. A low risk strategy would be to secure profits on the run up by selling before the catalyst drops. 

One optimal approach is sell enough shares to cover your cost basis and let your remaining shares ride into the catalyst. 

Curiously, GLSI has waited until circa 1:20 pm est to run on multiple occasions- I can’t even begin to speculate why but unless GLSI hits over $150 in the morning I will most likely be hanging out in the position until at least 2pm est. 

Obviously, I’ll use TA to monitor the situation and will adjust my current strategy depending on new data. 

With such a low float, low volume stock, poised to release such great news, it makes a realistic price target very hard to chart out or even predict with any confidence. If $GLSI can break past resistance in the low 50s, it could easily gap back up over 100 with enough volume. The possibility is there, the likelihood is unknown. 

I will be watching GLSI closely on 04/09, and will use indicators to help navigate the best exit price. Note, on their topline data, RSI went well past 95, so if one sold at 70 there would have been a lot of money left on the table.

Couple final tips to help you determine when to sell:

Don’t be greedy.

No one ever went broke taking profits.

If it’s worth screenshotting, it’s worth selling. 

&#x200B;

Insider Trading

From [https://fintel.io/n/us/glsi](https://fintel.io/n/us/glsi) we can see there were several insider purchases of the stock before the initial topline data was announced and have not see any selling of the stock, even during it’s 3000% run. This makes me very bullish. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Institutional Ownership

&#x200B;

Institutional Ownership (cont’d)

&#x200B;

All of the highlighted institutions opened positions for the first time in GLSI (17 out of 19). Institutional buy ins from major players like Vanguard, Blackrock, BAC, and Wells Fargo makes me extremely bullish."

04/05/2021,stocks,">I have around $5,000 a month I can save/invest.  My plan was to retire eventually and live off dividends.  

That's a very straight forward goal :-) - With that amount of money and the idea of early retirement, I suggest you get real financial advice from a financial advisor. I did that with less money to invest and other goals, and it was free at my bank, maybe around 4-6 hours of talking and figuring out what's best for me and what I want to achieve. They also ask really important questions, explaining all the possibilities and risk, and so on. A fund that invests most of the money in equities is not always the best idea."
04/05/2021,stocks,"This comment isn’t financial advice: 


> I am very new to investing. 


Stick with index funds or target date funds for the absolute best results, and do not panic sell. 


> My plan was to retire eventually and live off dividends. 


Harsh truth: Probably won’t happen


For Fun: By the year 2053, you will need $132,225 a year to have the equivalent of $60k in today’s money. The current yield of the S&P500 is 1.43%. This means you’d need $9.2M invested by the age of 65 to be able to live off dividends. However I assume you’re used to a much more expensive lifestyle because 5k a month is what you’re willing to throw at stocks. At 5k a month until you’re 65 you’d end up with around $6.5 million. 


Another harsh truth: Honestly there’s no logical basis for you to prefer cash from a dividend over cash from selling shares before taxes and fees.

> I saw someone mention the Eaton ETV fund on here but after doing a lot of looking online etc I don't see it mentioned much. Given it's over 8% dividend etc why isn't this fund more popular? 


Because it’s had a historically poor performance. You would’ve blasted yourself in the foot by investing in that. 


Also don’t take advice from here very seriously. This sub and Reddit in general is full of novices who think they’re better than Warren Buffett. That confidence is often borne out of ignorance. 


> Is it worth investing thousands a month into this fund? Is there something else more attractive?


It would be better to invest in a good balanced portfolio of index funds or a target date fund or two depending how hands-on you want to be. 


Target Date Funds, the most hands-off approach: 


VFIFX: 2050 Target date fund 


VFFVX: 2055 Target date fund 


VTTSX: 2060 Target date fund. 


If you want a more hands-on approach that will give you the best results, go with index funds: 


https://www.bogleheads.org


r/bogleheads 


VTI: US Total market fund


VXUS: Total International 


AGG: US Aggregate Bond Fund 


What I’ve heard some people do is look at the Target date fund’s holdings and then mimic it with their index funds for a cheaper expense ratio. Example: 


VFFVX’s holdings: 

54% in VTI 

36.3% in VXUS

6.7% in BND

2.9% in BNDX"

I’ve tried swing trading off and on. For me the opportunity cost of time wasted and capital lost is not worth trying it. 


> I personally feel that deploying a rigorous system consistently is a great approach, 


And this is often where the lack of learning stems from. Often I hear the advice of “stick with a strategy” from traders, and if you do that, and you’re losing money, then obviously you need to change something. 


Just in my opinion, this logic of “follow a strategy” falls into the gambler’s fallacy. 


> but it’s not as easy as sticking your cash in an ETF as you presumably do? It’s probably easier than picking stocks though - I’m terrible at that!


Trading is probably the hardest form of generating wealth with stocks. 


Individual stock picking: Finding good undervalued stocks is hard. Often people over complicate thing by holding 30+ stocks and investing in things they don’t understand. 



Index ETF: The easiest and statistically the best strategy for everyone. But people over complicate this as well, I have in the past too. People also panic sell which hurts gains. 


Sector/Factor ETFs: Harder to use, but easier than picking stocks. 


Trading: Oof. Timing markets, finding good stocks to trade each day, bear markets and the list of why it’s difficult goes on."

Sub 1% of professional traders make more than minimum wage. 


And earning $80 a week depends on what you’re starting with.


IMO, setting a goal like “I need to earn ____ in ___ amount of time” is a great way to lose money."

Secondly, while they are the brand leader in cola there are areas they have easy wins. Powerade only holds a around 30% market share but is now partnered with the Olympics and FIFA and there are rumours of CC forming a new business unit in Africa.

The main reason for me is their sustainability (or lack thereof), the industry itself is one of the worst polluters and creators of plastic waste and CC is the worst within that. But as the market leaders CC are positioned perfectly to lead a transformation in the industry. They’ve already started in Europe, for example they’ve partnered with one of the largest retailers in Europe to trial refillable bottles instead of plastic (https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-53406881) The technology is probably still 5-10 years away from being sustainable but this is a long term medium/low risk hold from me"

04/05/2021,stocks,"Broadening this topic to green tech as a whole. Some weird dynamics all over the place.

**Hydrogen**: Hydrogen's obstacle is that storage is still heavy compared to petroleum (reducing range) and it is more [expensive](https://cleantechnica.com/2019/04/26/hydrogen-cars-have-4x-annual-fuel-cost-2-70-times-the-carbon-debt-as-electric-vehicles/). Hopefully more research will help, but it isn't ready. It also isn't nearly as environmentally friendly as any of the other green tech out there.

**EV**: EV's obstacle is manufacturing to scale of the big automakers (see Tesla's struggles), and the looming threat that one of those big automakers will get serious about EVs (think the Chevy Bolt). It is possible both that EV's dominate the market in 2050, and that most of those EVs are made by today's big automakers.  That said, regardless of who wins the EV world, it will be a win not just for climate, but also for human health. Reducing air pollution will have a big impact on people who live in cities. 

**Renewables**: In my opinion, the bad news train stops with renewable energy. There is a really good business case for both solar and wind ([they are cheaper than competing fossil fuels](https://ourworldindata.org/cheap-renewables-growth)). In many cases, putting solar panels on your roof is cheaper per mWh than a nuclear plant. Utility solar and wind can be cheaper than natural gas plants. Solar is an interesting case because it has a smaller footprint in the current US grid, but prices are dropping very fast. So its growth potential is very high in the coming years. Wind is a slower and steadier horse, but I don't expect its price per mWh to fall nearly as fast as solar. The good news is that the companies today will likely reap the windfalls. The reality is that while Toyota could pivot hard to EVs and compete with small cap EV manufacturers, Exxon can't similarly pivot and become the dominant solar panel manufacturer. So tomorrow's Exxon in renewables is probably out there today. 

But right now, price movements for all of the above have been correlated. I find this confusing for the reasons listed above. In the long run I expect renewable energy to have sunnier days ahead compared hydrogen or EVs because the wind is at its back. In the short term, I expect a very bumpy road ahead for green tech."
04/05/2021,stocks,Because everyone knows “green” energy is bullshit. It doesn’t provide the amount of energy needed to run city wide infrastructure like coal or nuclear does.

04/05/2021,stocks,"yes the sun is useless...  

Coal and oil is stored solar energy that we are depleting faster than we can regenerate it and most modern open societies are abandoning nukes as uneconomical and unsafe.

Some renewables can provide baseline power, while other sources are variable and benefit from storage.

Most green energy is now cheaper than coal oil and nukes, especially if the massive subsidies are removed."

04/05/2021,stocks,"I didnt say it was just about using it safely. Cars blowing up has been an issue for decades. Fix this loophole and more will be spent on harnessing and using it.  

   If people weren't so scared of nuclear power, we could supply plenty through electrolysis. Heck. you can do this at your house with electricity and water. reforming through gas is used but too much carbon emission and not the only way. Blows my mind how many people don't know this."

04/05/2021,stocks,Sure they can be back ups and help. But the tech isn’t there yet for 100 “green”
04/05/2021,stocks,"Exactly. People confuse it for a fuel source, but it's really just an energy storage method that is a pain to store. There's some interesting potential there to help renewables store power when peak generation doesn't line up with peak demand, but I don't see it being useful for transportation."
04/05/2021,stocks,"The efficiencies, when you look at the energy used to move a car a mile, are much lower: 

Electricity -> electrolysis -> compression -> fuel cell -> electric motor, vs 

Electricity -> battery -> electric motor. 

It turns out that you need about 3x as much energy input for a FCEV then BEV, to move it a given distance:

https://insideevs.com/news/406676/battery-electric-hydrogen-fuel-cell-efficiency-comparison/

Hydrogen wins out range per weight, and time to fuel up, but its lead in both is shrinking."
04/05/2021,stocks,Yes I don't believe the hydrogen is great for passenger vehicles. Warehouse vehicles are different story and stationary power as storage and backup is a good use case for it though
04/05/2021,stocks,"Exactly you can produce or harness any form of energy. For fuck's sake there is this supermarket in S Korea where the pressure of the people moving on its tiles is used for lighting.
The problem is in the storage. Why what Tesla did is remarkable."

For this vote to take place, shareholders must vote for a reverse stock split as well as the change in control and issuance of new shares. 

Should these votes be positive, the two companies will merge, creating Palisade Bio. In the case of a merger, Seneca shareholders will own about 26% of Palisade Bio and enjoy a contingent value right, or CVR, giving shareholders rights to 80% of proceeds from Seneca Biopharma’s legacy assets. 

In the video, the CEO explained that the merger would be beneficial to Seneca shareholders, who are frustrated with historical stock performance. He went on to explain that through the merger, Seneca shareholders will enjoy ownership in a company with a world-class management team, several valuable ts, and a focus on providing shareholder value. 

Leading BioSciences has a strong pipeline of gastrointestinal drugs and a management team that has a strong history of performance. Moreover, not only will Seneca shareholders receive access to this management team and pipeline, should the merger be approved, shareholders will also enjoy an 80% share in legacy assets, So, you’re really not giving up much here.

This man was charged 800k in taxes even tho he only made 40k in profits. Because of the wash rule, you are only allowed to claim losses if you hold for a period of over 30 days. 

He transacted 45million dollars worth of trades and was taxed for every dollar he was gained and was unable to deduct any loss.

04/05/2021,stocks,"I studied this way back when. NNOX's claim to fame is inventing a cheaper lightbulb.  But when you look at the bigger picture, it doesn't make complete sense why this would matter to clinics that would be their potential market. 

In super-simplified terms, Xray machines have two key parts: an emitter (which I'll call a light bulb or light tube) and a receiver/detector.

NNOX has apparently only invented a cheaper lightbulb (emitter), not a new detector.  Sounds great, right?  But in reality, the ""light bulb"" component of legacy X Ray machines virtually never fails, and if it does, it's always covered by the seller/leaseholder of the machine for free.  So they're effectively replacing something that nobody who thinks it through will care about.

And supposedly their light bulb is very limited in what parameters it operates, whereas the legacy light bulb sources can be dialled in for all kinds of uses.

If NNOX had invented BOTH a cheaper light tube AND a cheaper detector, then that would be compelling.  But apparently they haven't.

Maybe that take is wrong, and maybe there's some opportunity for slightly lowering the capital cost and the necessary building wiring for a new clinic install.  But it's apparently not as revolutionary as the company promoters make it sound."
04/05/2021,stocks,"Sounds like a solid thesis. I do wonder though, are the markets going to understand this and value accordingly? Or will the market miss these nuances and overvalue? Could be profit in it either way"

I bought it because I anticipated SPY going up along with the rest of the S&P this week. I feel like we'll have a good green week across the board after things have been slow.

I had done a couple of options before on AMC and lost...so wanted some advice for people who actually do this stuff.

SPY looks like it will open at or around $403.00 today, and I think that it could go up. At what point does it make sense to consider selling the option...it could potentially be ITM as of today, so of course it will increase in value, and will also have the whole time value as well.

Obviously, it could go up as well during this week, but what do people usually do in terms of deciding when to take profits/cut losses? I don't want to get too jumpy, because I do feel like it could have a good week, but I'm also a newbie so I'm kind of nervous as well. Any tips for a reasonable strategy for determining when is a good time to stay / cash out?"

That being said, I’d be surprised if you made any money off of this option even if SPY does close above your strike, simply because of theta decay.  Depends on what the price of the option was.

04/05/2021,stocks,Spy can be volatile so even a 20-30% profit would be good to get out. It just depends on what your game plan is. Could it go higher? Sure. Could it go lower? Sure. Pick a percentage you’d be happy with and sell.

04/05/2021,stocks,its not about where they are right now its about where they will be in years time when states start legalizing. they are doing a lot of partnerships and acquisitions to set themselves up to being one of the biggest players in the game. their present day value and financial statements and profits obviously wont reflect that since they are spending a lot.
04/05/2021,stocks,Its a bookie and the biggest coolest one you cant lose
04/05/2021,stocks,"Market cap is simple: it's the number of shares times the price per share.  

A company with a billion shares, trading at $8, means it's an $8 billion market cap.

NEVER compare one company's share price to another company's share price, because each company will have different amounts of shares."
04/05/2021,stocks,"Haven’t done any research on penn but for Draft kings I don’t see a whole lot of upside potential in the next 2-3 years. The stock has had a crazy run up but I expect a large drop if the company has any issues. They also don’t really have a competitive edge or a moat to protect their business for their competitors.
 
As for your question about the correlation between market cap and share value, market cap is just the share value multiplied by outstanding shares of a company. When looking at a stock, the stock price tells you nothing, all it does is show you how much you have to pay but when you’re evaluating a company you don’t have to pay attention to the stock price only the market cap."
04/05/2021,stocks,"I'll offer a counter opinion.  DKNG has had stair step moves up as various states have signalled positive prospects for online gambling.  

It's a land grab right now, so whichever companies establish themselves earliest and most well known will succeed long term.

Draftkings is probably the best of the breed operator and marketer, the biggest, and becoming a household name.  That's their moat.  To say they won't have a moat is kind of like saying Coca Cola doesn't have a moat because anyone can sell sugar water.  It's sort of true but mostly not.

An investment in Draftkings is a play on whether one thinks that budget-strapped states will be looking for creative stealth ways to tax people through discretionary gambling.  If you think that's a likely trend going forward, then $25 billion is probably low.

Penn is slightly different in that they have the kooky Barstool tie-in that will get them publicity, sometimes positive, sometimes negative.  Penn also is involved in physical casinos so as those re-open or re-close, that drives Penn."

Makes no sense unless who ever was selling did so this prewritten bloomberg article in mind.

GameStop filed an ATM in December which they completed by the way. Nobody here even knows that because they don’t know how to find that information

04/05/2021,stocks,If they do issue the full amount this essentially guarantees a floor of probably 30-40. Very good for DFV

This doesn't affect anything and you properly know it. They are not releasing any new shares right now, this is a utterly normal process."

04/05/2021,stocks,"Or they can sell shares tomorrow and then the squeeze is kaput. Or they can sell the shares during a squeeze and the squeeze is then kaput. 

If you’re a trader waiting for a short squeeze, the possibility of having the company increase the size of the float is most definitely not bullish as hell

For GameStop on the other hand, being able to sell more equity at levels much higher than its fundamental value is bullish as hell"
04/05/2021,stocks,"Share dilution is always a bearish signal, it means the company feels their stock is overvalued AND they are cash poor."
04/05/2021,stocks,"Just curious, If so bullish, why is price dipping so hard? Don’t understand that."
04/05/2021,stocks,This is no way bullish news lol its just delirious to think diluting shares is bullish
04/05/2021,stocks,"What’s misinformation? If they release more shares, then the float increases and a short squeeze is more difficult. 

Do you know how stock dilution works? This is just common sense."

04/05/2021,stocks,"Correct.  The fact that the hedgefund sponsored news networks only focused on this, and not the other gme newsroom pub release this morning that said march sales were up 18% YOY.

It’s down less than 5%"
04/05/2021,stocks,"It's not Bullish.  Management know marketization is outrageous and want to sell shares to finance future operations based on it.  For shareholders it means long term the value of shares are diluted and short term that the price will go down because no matter how many redditors ""HODL"" to reduce sell side demand the company will just issue shares depressing the price."
04/05/2021,stocks,"Another short ladder attack they’re coordinated, today there was apparently a market watch article talking about the dip way before it actually happened"
04/05/2021,stocks,"Because it represents a potential dilution. Eg let’s say your ownership was previously 5% of the company, but after new shares are issued your ownership would be smaller"
04/05/2021,stocks,"**They didn't release more shares however my friend,** they only reserved the right to do so in the future.

That is why I called it missinformation. The Amount of shares is also not siginificant, even if they would be released right now. I mean, total shares and how many new ones there are are both easy to check numbers, so I doubt you can argue that point."

04/05/2021,stocks,I would urge you look up the ownership of gme stock. The vast majority is owned by institutions. Retail owns around 10%.  So how the hell can retail manipulate the stock with such low ownership?
04/05/2021,stocks,You’re a tool. Stop spreading misinformation.

04/05/2021,stocks,Please provide your source of over 100% of float is shorted.  I have seen nothing even close to that number.
04/05/2021,stocks,The source is the two months worth of DD spread out across multiple subs on reddit. Source is the immense amount of misinformation and FUD shared by the media and seen daily on Reddit.

04/05/2021,stocks,Source of it being shorted over 100%? Apes still drinking the kool-aid

04/05/2021,stocks,"I never said that they released more shares, but they are obviously thinking about it by filing the paperwork and that’s why the stock is down. It could happen at any time."
04/05/2021,stocks,Do yourself a favor and research what stock dilution means. I’m not sure what information it is you think I’m missing. I have no stake in GME but you should educate yourself a bit on some fundamental investing concepts
04/05/2021,stocks,"“As of Dec. 8 Gamestop had closed 462 stores in 2020.  In addition, the company announced in a Dec. 8 presentation to investors that it will close more than 1,000 stores by the end of its fiscal year in March, according to Yahoo.”

The decision to close all stores for covid was made on 3/22/20, so it wasn’t the whole month they were down.  They’ve since permanently closed at least 10% of their stores since then according to their Dec ‘20 presser quoted above, and according to wikipedia as of 2/20 they had 5,509 stores pre covid.  No final tally but as per the above announcement - as of today’s date approx 25% of the stores that existed just before covid, have now been closed permanently - and yet March sales are up 22%.  

Coupled with the fact that the previous filing for share issuance had a 3.5m share cap and $100m cash cap - and this updated filing has it as the same 3.5m shares but with a $1b cash cap, suggests they’re basically valuing their stock at a minimum of around $300 per share.  

Bullish."

04/05/2021,stocks,"That's not the situation with GME at all. Over 100% of the float is owned by institutions alone, so while someone buying up more shares might drive the price up somewhat, it's very unlikely to play a significant role in the triggering the squeeze.

Volume tracks shares traded, and the same shares can be traded multiple times and thus are counted multiple times. Not sure why you WSB/meme stonkers go tinfoil hat when confronted with things you don't understand."
04/05/2021,stocks,"Listed at 18% short now, there’s all kinds of wacky DD happening on WSB."
04/05/2021,stocks,"From what I understand that was a gamma squeeze, which is technically a squeeze but think of it as the appetizer to the main course which is the short squeeze. We would have experienced the short squeeze as well during that time had robinhood and other shady brokers not taken away the ability for people to buy the stock. Had they not done that the stock price would have been in the thousands. This was confirmed by some brokerage or hedge fund manager during an interview on CNBC"
04/05/2021,stocks,"Posted 27min ago.  

You’re fearmongering. In the grand scheme of things it barely moved."
04/05/2021,stocks,"I'm honestly mindblown that people here are pretending stock dilution and share issuance by a company is bullish for investors when it objectively isn't. Either they know better and are hoping to convince less knowledgeable new traders otherwise so they have someone to hold the bag on the stock or they don't know how this works.

Bottom line: expect $900M more dollars of sell side demand than you knew about previously.  It's possible there are enough buyers at these prices to match it.  But this is not bullish for investors."
04/05/2021,stocks,"Stocks down?

It isn't. 

Are they thinking about it? Who knows, but why ignore my obvious: Its not siginificant even if they would information?"
04/05/2021,stocks,"Hahah yes okay, thanks for the advice comrade. Stock dilation is a simple concept. The degree of the dilution is relevant, I suggest you grab a calculator and try to explain to yourself how that works :)"
04/05/2021,stocks,🚀🚀🚀
04/05/2021,stocks,"It's an update of something they posted in December. Back then it was for up to $100 million. Now it's up to $1 billion.

Which means, they also see the squeeze incoming and not the other way around. 

It can also mean they see their fair market value of $285/share. ($1B divide by 3.5 million shares.)"
04/05/2021,stocks,Awareness is the plan.
04/05/2021,stocks,His comment is revealing truth. That's one of the most powerful things anyone can do.
04/05/2021,stocks,"True. I don't know many people whose sole purpose is to hurt hedgefunds, though. Most of us are hoping to make a profit, I think, although I'm sure that's not 100% of people."
04/05/2021,stocks,True and you also didn’t answer my question.
04/05/2021,stocks,"Well, being a shill and trying to manipulate others out of their gains is super mean so they deserve it dammit!"
04/05/2021,stocks,Which would be the new dtcc rules right?
04/05/2021,stocks,Yikes
04/05/2021,stocks,"Can I attempt to interject some logic into your thoughts for one minute?  If this was really true, why would the “hedgies” not just buy some call options to you know, *hedge* their short position?"
04/05/2021,stocks,Ok I see. Imo it’s still a pretty high volume given the whole motto for the stock is diamond hands and hold. Nobody is actually selling for $180 except day traders
04/05/2021,stocks,"Asking a question  to someone smarter than me isn’t fearmongering. It was down over $20 pre market and someone saying how that’s a good thing. Idc one way or another whether it dips or raises I’m holding either way. But was curious to know from someone who has a clue, unlike me, how it dipping is a good thing."
04/05/2021,stocks,"It is bullshit to the long term investor playing a transition in a company. It also is bullish for a company with only 300 million in debt but potentially 1.6 billion in cash. That is a lot of money to fund a transition as well as potentially acquire other business. As well as simply raising the floor of the stock as their balance sheet looks significantly better. 

If they sell those shares at 500 a share or the like its also a significantly smaller share dilution. Share dilution can be bad... but context is important. 

This isn't AMC quadrupling their share count in a year. This is a company that spent the last decade buying back stock and cutting their float by over half. Releasing potentially as much as 5 percent back into the market.. but most likely much less."
04/05/2021,stocks,If you were right they would already sell in december but they didn't. It's just an option to sell and they upped the average sale price to $285 from $17 that they wanted in december.
04/05/2021,stocks,Stop trying to argue with these people - you are 100% correct but people are so desperate for a squeeze they will take a bear and call it a bull.
04/05/2021,stocks,"The amount of shares they are able to sell stayed the same, all they did was increase the maximum amount of money those shares can be worth. It is now capped at 1 billion which means, assuming they sell all the shares they are allowed to, the price would have to be around 285 for that to happen. They are showing that they think the price would go up, otherwise there is no reason to increase the dollar cap."
04/05/2021,stocks,"Not significant to who? It should be significant to you as a shareholder because its potentially 5% more shares on the market, reducing your ownership and putting sell side pressure on the stock."
04/05/2021,stocks,Short float will be sub 10% after they sell more shares. Keep clowning yourself. lol
04/05/2021,stocks,Thanks for sharing the info!
04/05/2021,stocks,"I don't know enough about it to say for sure, but that's my understanding as well. I've also heard a reverse split could be another method."
04/05/2021,stocks,They WILL sell. It would be stupid not to. They most likely need money to implement a new business plan.
04/05/2021,stocks,"Again, bullish for the company that can boost their balance sheet but not for shareholders of GME. 

A stock dilution reduces your ownership of a company. E.g. you used to own 5% of a company as a shareholder but now own 4% because of a dilution as there are more shares available."
04/05/2021,stocks,"They increases the dollar cap so they can sell more shares now while the price is high.  But that sell side pressure will effect the price all the way down.  I think management have decided that they need to do more to take advantage of this bubble. That's really smart and will help the company stay afloat in the long run, but it won't help the reddit traders whose hodl strategy is threatened by the issuance of new stock."
04/05/2021,stocks,"This is like buying a can of coke and being suprised it comes in a can, then insisting the can is leaking.

There are no shares released and even if, its a completly normal process. People that trade stocks know this, thankfully, but they are rarly on this sub."
04/05/2021,stocks,That's a crazy math you've done here lmao
04/05/2021,stocks,"Oh, I see. You're also part of r/gmemeltdown.

I guess you bought in at $300 like a true FOMOing r-tard and couldn't hold on because obviously you don't have diamond vagina.

You can easily hide short positions through options by hiding it into deep ITM calls. You already played yourself, leave it while you still have negative dignity. I don't want you to end up like short sellers and be morally bankrupt too."
04/05/2021,stocks,"Umm, they went from potentially selling 6 million shares at 100 million dollars to potentially selling 3.5 million shares at 1 billion. Sounds bullish to me. 2.5 million less shares that might get sold"
04/05/2021,stocks,"I don’t understand your analogy at all. 

They made the filing to signal that they are going to most likely issue some new shares. If they do release shares then your ownership percentage of the company decreases. If this doesn’t bother you, then fine, good for you"
04/05/2021,stocks,Oh no I sold during January squeeze 🤣🤣 for juicy realized gains.
04/05/2021,stocks,"It's a renewal of an agreement they had a while back. It doesn't signal anything, it simply gives them the possibility."
04/05/2021,stocks,You keep telling yourself that 😂.
04/05/2021,stocks,Bet you don’t know realized gain is 🤣🤣. GME meltdown is great sub. We are just making fun GME apes and bag hodlers there
04/05/2021,stocks,You clearly need a better hobby. Maybe the pandemic hasn't been so nice to you. Wish you all the best.
04/05/2021,stocks,"Subs like that and people like you that frequent them are cringe. Get a hobby. Some of us made 6 figures + on the GMEs run ups. 

A quick look tells me half the members of that sub are butt hurt people who got burned in January or worse, sad people who missed the opportunity."
04/05/2021,stocks,How did we sell during the Jan run up considered burnt?? Lol GME meltdown are full of memes. Enjoy!
2021-04-05 15:24:11,stocks,"CVM (CEL-SCI). Pharma Play for April. **Who:** 

CVM (CEL-SCI)

&nbsp;

**What:**

 CEL-SCI is a biotech company running a Phase III clinical trial with its flagship compound, Multikine.  Multikine (Leukocyte Interleukin, Injection) is an investigational immunotherapeutic agent being developed as a potential treatment for head and neck cancer, and cervical dysplasia or perianal warts in HIV / HPV co-infected patients. If it were to be approved for use following completion of our clinical development program, Multikine could be part of the next generation of cancer immunotherapy because:
•	It is being developed as an off-the-shelf investigational therapy making large scale manufacturing at a reasonable cost possible.
•	It is being developed with both active and passive immunity, which means that no external antigens are needed; and
•	 It is being studied for administration prior to surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, when the immune system may be more intact and thus with greater potential to be activated.

&nbsp;

**Why Now:**

In April 2020, CEL-SCI announced that the last event required to complete the trial had happened. The data lock phase has taken longer than expected due to COVID constraints and for the length of the process required to gather the data of this 10 years lasting multi-center and multi-country trial. CEL-SCI management has stated the 298th event has not occurred which hints that Multikine is effective. Survival of cancer patients going through S-RT or S-CRT is 57.4% at year 3, and 48.2% at year 5 in America. Based on current information we can safely conclude that patients are living much longer than they should already. There is speculation that the expected survival rate could be increased to 74.4%!

&nbsp;

**Why CVM:**

CEL-SCI says even with new treatments being researched and discussed. The use case for Multikine will remain because it is administered BEFORE starting any other treatments. The objective is to extend the life span with a certain quality for patients to receive treatment and prevail. This is also the largest study of head and neck cancer to date. 

&nbsp;

**Positions:**

300 Shares. Planning on upping to 500 EOD. 

&nbsp;

**Additional Stats:**

Short Interest: 20.70%

S3 SI Float: 17.15%

Unusual Whale Activity: None

I initially wrote this for another sub that I frequent more. However, due to the market cap, I am unable to post there. I didn't want this to go to waste I initially wrote this on Wednesday (4/31) before it jumped over 8%. But if the data is as good as they hope this thing is going to sky rocket in my opinion."

04/05/2021,stocks,"Maybe, but I have a feeling it could come and go with no news and cause a huge dump in share price.

2021-04-05 15:17:36,stocks,"Janet Yellen to call for global minimum tax rate Janet Yellen will use her first major address as Treasury secretary to argue for a global minimum corporate tax rate, Axios has learned, as she makes the case for President Biden’s plan to raise U.S. corporate taxes to fund his $2 trillion+ infrastructure plan.

Why it matters: Convincing other countries to impose a global minimum tax would reduce the likelihood of companies relocating offshore, as Biden seeks to increase the corporate rate from 21% to 28%.

“Competitiveness is about more than how U.S.-headquartered companies fare against other companies in global merger and acquisition bids,” Yellen will say today in a speech to the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, according to an excerpt of her prepared remarks obtained by Axios.
""It is about making sure that governments have stable tax systems that raise sufficient revenue to invest in essential public goods and respond to crises, and that all citizens fairly share the burden of financing government.""
""We are working with G20 nations to agree to a global minimum corporate tax rate that can stop the race to the bottom.""
The big picture: President Trump lowered the U.S. rate from 35% to 21%, arguing that U.S. companies were at a global disadvantage and were being incentivized to relocate offshore.

The average corporate rate in the G7 is 24%, with some nine countries recently lowering their corporate rate, according to the Tax Foundation, a conservative tax group.
Biden’s plan would also raise the international minimum rate for foreign profits from U.S. companies from 10.5% to 21%, which would still be lower than the 28% domestic corporate rate.
Driving the news: Biden has tapped five Cabinet secretaries to explain — and sell — his plan to the American public, including Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Marcia Fudge, Labor Secretary Marty Walsh and Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo.

Yellen’s task is to make the international case. Her speech also is designed to set the tone for the annual spring International Monetary Fund and World Bank meetings in Washington, which will begin virtually this week.
Between the lines: Biden has been relying on Yellen to convince the business community and reassure Wall Street that his $2 trillion+ infrastructure proposal, on top of his $1.9 trillion stimulus package, won’t lead to inflation.

Now he’s deploying her to convince international finance ministers and central bankers that the world’s biggest economies need to act in concert on corporate rates to avoid a race to the bottom.
Go deeper: Yellen will also challenge the world’s economic powers to focus on climate change and on ways to improve vaccine access for the world’s poorest countries.

She will call for $650 billion in new “Special Drawing Rights” — essentially lines of credit at the IMF that can help developing countries access more U.S. dollars.
The Trump administration was skeptical of new SDR allocations and many congressional Republicans are still opposed.
The bottom line: By trying to convince other countries to impose a global minimum tax, Yellen is acknowledging the risks to the American economy if it acts alone in raising corporate rates.

“Together we can use a global minimum tax to make sure the global economy thrives based on a more level playing field in the taxation of multinational corporations, and spurs innovation, growth, and prosperity,” she will say.

04/05/2021,stocks,Why any country would agree to this is beyond me.
04/05/2021,stocks,so were all moving to Africa and the Cayman Islands?
04/05/2021,stocks,Can someone explain how this makes any sense at all? Why would another country agree to this?
04/05/2021,stocks,"To me this screams that they know raising the taxes won’t do what they say it will for the US economy. If they are scared of businesses leaving to lower taxed nations, why not just leave the tax rate low for the time being? Am I missing something?"
04/05/2021,stocks,"Why is it that America collects taxes on its citizens living in another country but not on corporations housing money else where?


Seems like the simple solution is that if you want to do business in America you have to be financially located in America."
04/05/2021,stocks,"Companies look at more than the tax rate when deciding to relocate (even though of course, tax planning is probably 70% of the reason)."

04/05/2021,stocks,"Biden gonna ask Xi politely to charge american companies more to operate in china hoping it'll bring back everyone or even the playing field

It's like a landlord raising your rent 28% then demanding the other landlords raise their rates to prevent tennants from leaving

Either way expect higher prices on everything by Christmas"
04/05/2021,stocks,"Yeah no country is gonna agree to this, she's just using it as a scapegoat to blame when ultimately corporations leave to avoid higher taxes, this is such naive crap"
04/05/2021,stocks,These people say the right things but the actions.... are disaster. And of course the minimum percentage will increase over time.
04/05/2021,stocks,This just shows the Biden administration fully knows hiking taxes will lead to corporations leaving US. Now foreign leaders will be focusing on tax cuts to gain some economic advantage and welcome some fleeing corporations in open arms.
04/05/2021,stocks,Lol it would be equivalent of losing sovereignty if u agree to raise tax to American level. How fucking stupid and naive can Janet yellen be
04/05/2021,stocks,"Was reading through the comments thinking, “Wow, there are users in r/politics with a brain”.

It is single handedly one of the stupidest ideas I have ever read.

Let's be frank, the WTO needs to be disbanded. It is clear, and has been for many years now, that the WTO is a blow hard organization that is full of rhetoric, but zero bite, and how could it have any? It doesn't have a standing military or should it, it doesn't patrol trade routes, it doesn't have the authority to...do much.

It is a joke of an organization, whose sole purpose is to waste tax dollars from around the globe, where self proclaimed important ""experts"" have discussions that lead virtually no where."

The proposals are complex and there has already been pushback about the administrative burden and complexity of calculating this but it does seem to be the direction of travel.

The developing countries don't have much incentive to do so off the bat. 

But it isn't hard to imagine that if the developed Bloc does this, they would act together and leverage developing countries into coming to the table.

Large US Corps still have something like a couple Trillion in profits held off shore."
04/05/2021,stocks,The only way they'll agree to it is if each country agrees to a different minimum corporate tax rate with the US being the highest.
04/05/2021,stocks,"If countries acted as rational actors then it is mutually beneficial to everyone. This of course noting people aren't rational at the best of times.

So in our fantasy where there are rational state actors, a minimum corporate tax rate takes the bargaining ability away from large corporations and gives the power back to the nation states.

Taxes are necessary to run a government. You can get taxes from people, property, or companies. All countries get from all three buckets to varying degrees. Currently, if a big company wants to offshore their headquarters, there is incentive for the large company to locate on the country with the most favorable tax rate. It's quite rational on the corporation's part. If you setup an international minimum corporate tax rate then no country has to fear their biggest companies leaving just for a lower tax amount.

The second thing it solves is the current billions being hoarded in offshore accounts by big corporations. Everyone from Amazon to Apple outshores their money to avoid the corporate tax. Now if there was international minimum tax then tax havens go away as there is no longer any incentive.

Now, this will never pass because certain countries love being tax havens and let's face it, changing a system that would benefit the average person at the expense of the rich and powerful is dead on arrival."

You just need a bloc of developed countries to all agree to this and they can push around smaller countries into stopping the race to the bottom."
04/05/2021,stocks,Commonwealth of Dominica
04/05/2021,stocks,"Sure, countries want to be able to tax corporations that are in their country.

Right now a insane race to the bottom is happening where companies are saying “whoever has the lowest corporate tax rate gets our headquarters”.

This plan would set a minimum tax rate so countries can tax their companies with less fear of flight."
04/05/2021,stocks,No country would unless they were already planning on raising rates for their own political purposes. Which is what this is for the US. This is political fodder for the Democrats left.
04/05/2021,stocks,"The muscle of big countries has pushed a lot of small countries into agreeing to unfavorable terms and international agreements before. 

See the Investor State Dispute Systems put into some trade deals as an example of this. They've increasingly become a hot-button issue in recent trade deals because of how it can threaten a nation's sovereignty because it lets foreign businesses sue over new legislation that hurts their business. The whole system was originally created as a way of making sure small countries with a history of seizing the assets of foreign businesses behave themselves. They agreed to those unfavorable terms because otherwise they were unlikely to get any foreign investment.

Obviously this proposal is completely different from ISDS, but the point is big powerful countries can push smaller countries into agreeing to seemingly unfavorable terms if they have the right incentives to do so. If other first world countries agree with this proposal and want to push for it to become a worldwide thing don't count it completely out just because it would seem to go against a bunch of low tax countries interests."
04/05/2021,stocks,"This.  The global minimum tax is an attempt to prevent capital flight.  It is a clear admission the increased taxes will decrease business activity in the U.S.  It is also an acknowledgement that they are reaching the end of the line as far as how high taxes can be raised without serious business consequences.

Why he would push it, who knows, they aren't useful now or it wouldn't be a dying breed over the past 40-50 years.  A globally set corporate tax will only serve  to drive our prices up and there'll be no way around it.

Agreeing to a tax plan such as this would remove a fundamental advantage smaller nations have to attract and keep businesses that do business internationally.

The problem with the US tax code is that revenue earned overseas is taxed if they want to bring it back into the US. Sure, that's a good solution to combatting fraud of someone saying they earned the revenue in another country and using subsidiaries to work around, but it's also the reason so many large companies are holding so much cash. If FB earns 100 dollars overseas, they're taxed if they want to reinvest it back in the United States.

04/05/2021,stocks,Yes it does because if they would get taxed on corporate profits at 10% in country X it changes the math on whether to bring that money back to the US at 28%. That's like saying interest rates don't effect the market. What's your favorite flavor of window?
04/05/2021,stocks,"It’s stupidly foolish to think that only the 1% benefit from Ireland’s tax haven status. The money there creates jobs, just like it does in Switzerland.

04/05/2021,stocks,This wouldn't just benifit the US. It would benifit every single nation except ones that won the race to the bottom and change no corporate tax.  Like I said before it's up to the people of Ireland to decide if if having Chinese military bases in their backyards and losing access to Western markets is worth the benifit of allowing companies to come in and pay no tax.

04/05/2021,stocks,"Watching GME for entertainment today. With the offering people are freaking out.

Tbh there were discussions about offerings weeks back but I don’t think many of them read actual news.

Whether it’s being oversold on the news we’ll see, but the commentary is top notch"
04/05/2021,stocks,"Microvision is the stock people wish they bought few weeks, months, years from now at 15."
04/05/2021,stocks,Decent volume on GME so far. IMO that is a good sign. I wish I could have bought more a few hours ago. If this volatility keeps up I am hoping to sell and then buy back in when it drops. Been doing it the other way around so far.

04/05/2021,stocks,"Genuine question about the whole hedge fund/game stuff, a lot of people are claiming that it has been impossible for the hedge funds to settle the shorts and they are still 100%+ shorted. But could they not have just skimmed shares from the daily volume the past months and covered their shorts? When they deliver shares they don't just dissapear, they enter the market again right?"
04/05/2021,stocks,"What's a stock/etf/whatever that is a guranteed up for the next 30 days. I dont care if its .01%, I jus want a winner"
04/05/2021,stocks,I think they’re not allowed to pay attention to the news. It’s FUD.
04/05/2021,stocks,"Personally I don't believe they will exercise the option to sell more shares. For one thing, that would screw Cohen and other insiders holding shares, and for another, that would screw all the people that joined the frenzy that drove the price up in the first place. That would be a low blow that they would never be forgiven for. Although if we start seeing a lot of insider stock sales I'm out."

2021-04-05 14:53:48,stocks,"i don't think i can beat the market, maybe short - term but not for many years. so what funds should i just buy and forget ? I have come to accept that there's no way i can beat the market atleast not at the current prices of things since everything seems way overpriced to me but maybe that's just me. 

I'd like some suggestions on what are good managed funds you guys recommend buying ? i'd like investing 80-90% of my portfolio in funds that beat the market consistently and with the rest of the money i'll save for dips/market crash/golden opportunities if i think i can find any."

04/05/2021,stocks,VTI
04/05/2021,stocks,You are not alone 91% of actively managed hedge Fonds underperformed sp500 on a base of 15 years. Outperforming the market generally means outperforming a representative stock index. Which one is a personal conviction: I recommend not putting all your eggs in one basket: besides American indices invest a part in international Indices. Mostly let time play its game and reinvest cashflows to catch the compounding effect
04/05/2021,stocks,The thing is: over the long term it's almost impossible for funds to beat the market.
04/05/2021,stocks,"Vanguard , look no further."
04/05/2021,stocks,QQQ and you are done. If I could do it all over I'd put 70ish percent into that and forget about it for a few years.
04/05/2021,stocks,"How about birkshire hathaway ? 
(Brk.b or brk.a if you enough money)
They seem to being quite well"
04/05/2021,stocks,"Semi-strong form efficiency suggests no one can reliably beat the market over time without insider trading. 

Warren buffet made a $1m bet with another hedge fund manager that the vanguard index would outperform any fund that other guy picked over a 10 year period. Guess who won the bet lol.

Momentum trading is always possible, but that’s riding with the market instead of beating it, imo."
04/05/2021,stocks,VTI
04/05/2021,stocks,ETF
04/05/2021,stocks,Nas100 is probably the more reliable fund that consistently “beats” the market.
04/05/2021,stocks,RVRS
04/05/2021,stocks,"My choice is 70% VTSAX, 20% VGT, and 10% VTIWX,

This got me the best regression test on Portfolio Analyzer, and corresponds to my biases and comfort level."
04/05/2021,stocks,"VOO, VTI, VT, QQQ, preferably a mix of those are all good options IMO depending on your time horizon. 

I threw a lump sum in those around may of last year and I’m up 47% in that account. Of course this year was very unique, but I’d be comfortable adding to those over time any day."
04/05/2021,stocks,SPY
04/05/2021,stocks,You should look into wealthfront or any robo investor. They will help you get consistent long term gains.
04/05/2021,stocks,VTI and put some money on INTC (Intel) .
04/05/2021,stocks,"I use ITOT for ETF and FZROX for a mutual fund. Both have performed well and have low or no fees.

I use fidelity as my brokerage and back when I bought them these had no commission fees (back when that was a thing)"
04/05/2021,stocks,CTXR
04/05/2021,stocks,"can you elaborate on your reasons why you think VTI is a good choice ?

does VTI consistently beat the market ? I consider SPY as the market.

does it carry low risk ?

is it paying dividends on time ?

do they have good reputation ?"
04/05/2021,stocks,Which American index tracks a foreign-listed ticker?
04/05/2021,stocks,"Some funds **do** beat the market, take Peter Lynch fidelity magellan fund for example. the guy was beating the market by more than twice in a period of 13 years."

04/05/2021,stocks,Pretty tech heavy
04/05/2021,stocks,"Not during last 10 years. Check out latest annual letter from Buffet. Last year they had 2.4% return, to compare 20% to S&P."

04/05/2021,stocks,"Now, is it ? the same companies I didn't want to invest individually are in Nas100 and overpriced from my point of view. I do consider some of them, even most of them quite good but their P/E ratio is just so irrationale."
04/05/2021,stocks,"Reverse cap weighted large cap.

Interesting. It *loved* the election results.

I'd prefer reverse P/E weighted, but that could be hard to manage if one posts a negative number..."
04/05/2021,stocks,"If you can’t beat the market, buy the market. 

SPY is not the market. VTI is. 

VTI has been better than SPY historically and contains 4000 stocks vs SPY which has 500."
04/05/2021,stocks,"As an aside, there is basically no “low risk” way to “beat the market” in the long term. Having those questions back-to-back is a little concerning. Even if you believe individuals can beat the market over the long term, and you attribute that to skill rather than luck, they are still 99% of the time needing to take on additional risk in order to do so. So figure out which one you want, because you really can’t have both."
04/05/2021,stocks,"The folks at r/financialindependence have spoken extensively on VTI and VTSAX (same thing, ones an ETF and other is a mutual fund). A search for those funds will link you to blogs and other analysis.

You can also look up VTI's historical performance with your broker."
04/05/2021,stocks,"dozens, depends on what you're looking for, most of them are heavily exposed to china."
04/05/2021,stocks,"This is true, but it's nearly impossible to identify these funds before hand, only with hindsight. Meanwhile, there are far more funds that underperform the market, overperform for a bit and then underperform, overperform for a while and then underperform. It is nearly impossible to know beforehand which will do what. Managed funds come with significantly more risk than indexes if they're not just closet indexers.

If you're looking to beat the market look into Factor Investing, it gives significantly higher long term returns with a bonus of some diversification benefits. I do this with 1/3 Large Cap index, 1/3 Large Cap Value Index, and 1/3 Small Cap Value Index. Keep in mind though that the higher returns are because of increased risk, it may be a while before you see a pay off, but you will eventually see a pay off."
04/05/2021,stocks,"Performance metrics like that are measured using historical data. In 20 years you will be able to look back and pick dozens of funds that beat the market. Forward looking performance is what really matters, and there is no way to know which funds will outperform vs underperform the index. You can do your best research on funds, sectors, and money managers that have good track records, but it’s not a guarantee that they will outperform the market. Past performance is no guarantee of future results."
04/05/2021,stocks,Tech is going exponential :)
04/05/2021,stocks,"Well .. good years and bad..
I joined august last year..
I'm up 49%"
04/05/2021,stocks,"It sounds like you want the impossible. It’s either vti, spy or qqq if you want good performance long term. If you want to gamble there are plenty of etfs for that like arkk but no one can tell you what the market will do."
04/05/2021,stocks,"I believe most of the p/e’s are around 30-35. Which is on the high end sure but that’s nothing new for that space, It does provide high growth. 

if you’re looking for growth and value, you may never find that as people would be there long before you’d find it on Reddit.

Edit: beating the market on an etf is pretty difficult, you’re going to have to go to high risk areas"
04/05/2021,stocks,"I’ve made similar statements elsewhere in regards to the p/e. If I had the software I’d run a scenario excluding negative eps companies to see how it would have performed (rebalancing every quarter). Unfortunately, I don’t have that"
04/05/2021,stocks,"By that logic, VTI is not the market, VT is ;)"
04/05/2021,stocks,"
>historically

Mid-term.

Short-term, SPY is doing better.

[Long-term ](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/VTI:NYSEARCA?window=5Y&comparison=NYSEARCA%3ASPY) they just track each other, except in the pandemic runup, which is ending, and could mean retracement is coming for VTI.

Bottom line: you can't expect it to outperform unless you know a specific motivation for a divergence."
04/05/2021,stocks,"""heavily exposed to China""

Meaning US ADRs or just US companies that do most of their manufacturing in China?"
04/05/2021,stocks,"i have no doubt that many tech companies are fantastic businesses, but recently imo their stock prices are outperforming the underlying business"
04/05/2021,stocks,He underperforms more then 10 years in a row
04/05/2021,stocks,And how does that compare to rest of the market? Everyone's portfolio is up a decent amount since last August.
04/05/2021,stocks,"I wouldn't exclude them. I'd find a way to scale them so there isn't a singularity in the weighting.

It might always take manual intervention, to evaluate whether the negative earnings are their new normal and then they'd have to be excluded. But then that breaks the notion of a strategic fund and makes it actively-managed..."
04/05/2021,stocks,You are right of course. I was assuming US only as the comparison was to SPY.
04/05/2021,stocks,VTI outperforms VOO because it has ~30% small and mid cap exposure. VOO is less volatile though. You can't go wrong with either one (70% crossover) but VTI has my vote between the two.
04/05/2021,stocks,"And over-performed for decades before that.  So perhaps the way to ""beat the market"" is to buy something of very high quality (like Berkshire) that for a time is selling at a discount compared to the general market."
04/05/2021,stocks,"Right. That’s sort of the rub. Ideally, a very low negative p/e is more attractive than a higher one (a negative p/e of -1000 is more attractive than -10) because it reflects a lower absolute value of the denominator relative to price (they are losing less money). It’s easy enough to weight that, but finding a way to compare that to positive p/e’s is something that isn’t immediately evident.

There’s probably some sort of configuration that could work, but at that point, like you said, it’s creeping into the territory of an actively managed fund."
04/05/2021,stocks,"I know: scale by revenue/cost ratio, not delta income.

Then instead of -3% earnings you have 0.97 efficiency.

Price/efficiency is then a positive number that varies inversely with valuation and you can normalize weightings simply after that.

Kind of duh, now I look at it."
2021-04-05 13:43:26,stocks,"Best stocks for Biden's infrastructure plan This is great article from Seeking Alpha but since it's against the rules to link SA articles here I'll just copy/paste.

##**Engineering & Construction.** 
Analyst Sean Eastman says ""the reinforced focus on infrastructure stimulus and on climate resilience will be powerful multiyear themes.""

1. **AECOM** (NYSE:ACM) can expect a tailwind to its all-organic-growth strategy and ""transportation, environment, and water design/engineering"" represents 65% of revenue.
2. **Quanta Services** (NYSE:PWR) is ""a major enabler of the electrification of the economy, the interconnection of renewable power generation, and the modernization of the electric grid.""
3. **Dycom Industries** (NYSE:DY) is essentially a pureplay on telecom infrastructure specialty contracting and ""should be a beneficiary of rural broadband build-outs.""

##**Machinery & Equipment Rental.** 
Analysts Steve Barger and Ken Newman see ""particular upside potential for our construction machinery OEMs, equipment rental companies, and rail transportation manufacturers.""

1. **Oshkosh** (NYSE:OSK) and **Terex** (NYSE:TEX) are picks with a view that ""new and/or replacement buildings and infrastructure would drive increased utilization for AWPs, telehandlers and scissor lifts, cement mixers, crushing and screening equipment, and potentially fire and emergency trucks.""
2. **Federal Signal** (NYSE:FSS) will benefit from spending on replacement lead pipes and building affordable housing.
3. **Wabtec** (NYSE:WAB) should see business from modernizing public transit and investment in passenger and freight rail.
4. **United Rentals** (NYSE:URI) will get a broad boost from infrastructure spending because of the ""fungibility"" of its fleet.

##**Metals.** 
Analyst Phil Gibbs says the spending program will offer a demand catalyst in the ""intermediate term,"" but the size of the package will likely be closer to $500B to $1T.

1. Along with the broader group, direct beneficiaries with ties the infrastructure or earth-moving equipment will be, in order: **Commercial Metals** (NYSE:CMC), **Nucor** (NYSE:NUE), **Reliance Steel and Aluminum** (NYSE:RS), **Steel Dynamics** (NASDAQ:STLD), **Olympic Steel** (NASDAQ:ZEUS) and **Schnitzer Steel** (NASDAQ:SCHN).

##**Diversified Industrial.** 
Analyst Jeff Hammond thinks the entire group would benefit for fundamental and sentiment reasons.

1. **Colfax** (NYSE:CFX), from welding, **Harsco** (NYSE:HSC), **Eaton** (NYSE:ETN) and **nVent Electric** (NYSE:NVT), both for EV chargers, **Helios Tech** (NASDAQ:HLIO), **Gates Industrial** (NYSE:GTES) should benefit in transportation.
2. **Parker-Hannifin** (NYSE:PH), **ETN**, **NVT**, **Nordson** (NASDAQ:NDSN), **Altra Industrial Motion** (NASDAQ:AIMC), **Rexnord** (NYSE:RXN), **Regal Beloit** (NYSE:RBC), **CFX**, **Enerpac Tool Group** (NYSE:EPAC) will benefit in manufacturing.
3. **Carrier Global** (NYSE:CARR), **Lennox International** (NYSE:LII), **Trane Technologies** (NYSE:TT), **Watsco** (NYSE:WSO), for HVAC, should benefit in housing.
4. **CARR, LII, TT, WSO,** for ventilation upgrades, will benefit in schools spending.
5. **CARR, LII, TT** should benefit from federal building upgrades.
6. **ETN, Generac Holdings** (NYSE:GNRC) should benefit from alternative energy.

##**Auto Suppliers.** 
Analyst James Picariello says the plan is well targeted for the blueprints for mass EV adoption, which are ""strict and consistent emissions regulations, generous consumer tax incentives, and a determinable charging infrastructure buildout.""

1. **Aptiv** (NYSE:APTV) and **BorgWarner** (NYSE:BWA) lead EV supplier opportunities, followed by **Dana** (NYSE:DAN), **Meritor** (NYSE:MTOR), **Magna International** (NYSE:MGA) and **Lear** (NYSE:LEA), but the latter two would be disproportionately hit by higher corporate tax rates.
2. **MTOR** and **DAN** will also benefit from the impact on truck and off-highway markets.

##**Vertical Software.** 
Analyst Jason Celino thinks the plan would ""accelerate digitization opportunities across the architecture and construction industry.""

1. **Bentley Systems** (NASDAQ:BSY) gets 60% of total revenue from infrastructure, so the plan could lead to ""meaningful multiyear tailwinds.""
2. **Autodesk** (NASDAQ:ADSK) exposure to infrastructure of 15-20% of revenue and the ""completion of its Innoyze acquisition, providing solutions for water infrastructure assets, gives us incremental confidence.""
3. **Trimble** (NASDAQ:TRMB) has 25-30% of revenue from infrastructure ""geospatial, construction, and civil engineering offerings are well positioned.""

##**Chemicals.** 
Analyst Aleksey Yefremov highlights benefits for ""industrial coatings, polyurethanes, epoxy, PVC, and chlor-alkali.""

1. **Huntsman** (NYSE:HUN) will see higher end-market demand, with the most upside in polyurethanes.
2. **Olin** (NYSE:OLN) is a pick as the ""proposed spending package laid out plans for manufacturing spend, a key end market for caustic soda. Industrial coatings and adhesives is also a major end market for the Epoxy segment.""
3. **Westlake Chemical** (NYSE:WLK) is ""a beneficiary of strong PVC, building products (mostly pipe), and chlor-alkali markets.""
4. **DuPont** (NYSE:DD) has the most compatible portfolio for the spending bill.
5. **Albemarle** (NYSE:ALB), **Livent** (NYSE:LTHM) should benefit from a pickup in EV support.

##**Communication Services.** 
Analyst Brandon Nispel says the bill ""is positive for infrastructure providers (tower operators) and neutral to negative for network providers (wireless carriers and cable operators).""

1. **American Tower** (NYSE:AMT), **Crown Castle** (NYSE:CCI), **SBA Communications** (NASDAQ:SBAC) are picks in towers, which will be helped by improving investment in wireless networks.
2. **Altice USA** (NYSE:ATUS), **Cable One** (NYSE:CABO), **Charter Communications** (NASDAQ:CHTR), **Comcast** (NASDAQ:CMCSA), **WildOpenWest** (NYSE:WOW) may see a hit to discretionary cash flow due to a higher corporate tax rate.
3. **AT&T** (NYSE:T), **T-Mobile U.S.** (NASDAQ:TMUS) and **Verizon** (NYSE:VZ) are the most at risk of a corporate tax rate hike, with T and VZ seeing incremental taxes of $1.5B to $2B.

##**Entertainment and Video Games.** 
Analyst Tyler Parker says the plan for bringing high-speed broadband to every American will help domestic online vide games

1. **Activision** (NASDAQ:ATVI), **Electronic Arts** (NASDAQ:EA), **Take-Two Interactive** (NASDAQ:TTWO) and **Ubisoft** (UBISFY) could see tailwinds.

##**Semiconductors.** 
Analysts John Vinh and Wes Twigg say ""expansion incentives would likely be a tailwind for semiconductor equipment demand while easing the capex burden on manufacturers.""

1. **Applied Materials** (NASDAQ:AMAT), **ASML** (NASDAQ:ASML), **Advanced Energy Industries** (NASDAQ:AEIS), KLA (NASDAQ:KLAC), **Lam Research** (NASDAQ:LRCX) and **Teradyne** (NASDAQ:TER) would benefit in equipment names.
2. **Analog Devices** (NASDAQ:ADI), **Intel** (NASDAQ:INTC), **Micron** (NASDAQ:MU), **ON Semiconductor** (NASDAQ:ON) and **Texas Instruments** (NASDAQ:TXN) are picks among those with domestic manufacturing footprints.

##**Utilities.** 
Analyst Sophie Karp notes the majority of the impact on the sector would not come from direct spending, but from fiscal incentives.

1. **American Electric Power** (NASDAQ:AEP), **Southern** (NYSE:SO), **Duke Energy** (NYSE:DUK), **Dominion Energy** (NYSE:D), **Entergy** (NYSE:ETR) and **Edison International** (NYSE:EIX) can benefit from incremental grid investment initiatives and electrifications trends from an EV tide that will ""lift all boats.""
2. **Eversource Energy** (NYSE:ES), **Avangrid** (NYSE:AGR), **Public Service Enterprise Group** (NYSE:PEG), **NextEra Energy** (NYSE:NEE), **Xcel Energy** (NASDAQ:XEL), **AEP**, **Sunrun** (NASDAQ:RUN), **Sunova Energy** (NYSE:NOVA) will be helped by the extension of the investment tax credit and the production tax credit further boosting commercial solar and wind.
3. **Public Service Enterprise Group** (PEG), **Excelon** (NASDAQ:EXC) and **Energy Harbor** (OTCPK:ENGH) would benefit from any concrete federal program to support nuclear energy.
4. **First Solar** (NASDAQ:FSLR) may get a boost if solar installers can bypass Chinese tariffs.

##**Oil and Gas Exploration and Production.** 
Analyst Leo Mariani says the plan ""is likely to have a bit of a long-term negative for traditional U.S. oil E&Ps if it accelerates the transition away from fossil fuels for transportation purposes, but we generally think that other variables that normally impact the price of oil over the next few years are much more likely to affect energy stocks as opposed to the impacts of this bill, which will take a healthy part of this decade and into the next to make a material impact.""

##**Life Science Tools.** 
Analyst Paul Knight says ""a specific call-out of 'biotechnology' as a key technology investment is positive."""

04/05/2021,stocks,"The error in the videogame play is that monthly data caps are a very real problem. What good is broadband when modern games have 75gb+ downloads, 1+gb patches and require constant internet access?

I regularly get dangerously close to my 1TB cap and I'm a moderate gamer who likes to stream tv in the evenings. 

I had to stop my twitch activity because it triggered my cap warnings every month. I'm 1 person, it has to be even worse if you have multiple people in your household.

04/05/2021,stocks,First what is the plan? Is it 90% pork and 10% actual investments in infrastructure ? It’s hard to know until some clarity around details are announced
04/05/2021,stocks,US Steel up 33% since end of Jan
04/05/2021,stocks,"My holdings in this space (mid term investing, not trading): 

- Mfg bump: ROK, ETN, PH, JCI
- Materials: CLF (vertically integrated)


Still looking for more. This admin/congress will spend and spend and spend. Taxes come with this so you have to be invested in the companies that see some return back from the govt for what they’re putting in. You need to pick the winners and avoid the losers."
04/05/2021,stocks,None of this will matter when the great reset is in full song and dance

04/05/2021,stocks,FLXS Flexsteel U.S. Already up 15% in less than 10 days. Only going to go up.
04/05/2021,stocks,Is there any evidence whatsoever that such broadband expansions lead to any increase in video game revenue? It's not like bandwidth was ever the bottleneck... The gameplay networking is usually custom and really optimized to not need a lot of bandwidth. Do they expect more people to buy videogames because they'll be able to download them in an hour instead of overnight?
04/05/2021,stocks,Thoughts on XLE?
04/05/2021,stocks,[LUFF Brands](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LUFF.CN/community?p=LUFF.CN) and [High Tide](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/quote/HITI.V/).  Buy and hold for 3 months.  Simplest 2x you'll see.
04/05/2021,stocks,"Just keep in mind that the infrastructure deal is not guaranteed. There are enough opponents to it in both parties to put a stop to it, at least the way it is now. This reminds me too much of the ""shovel ready jobs"" that were never even started and all the money given to green energy companies that failed, Solyndra ring any bells? On top of that, most of the money in that plan has nothing to do with infrastructure (9% of last Covid bill actually went to things that had anything to do with Covid) and even if it somehow passes, even what is for infrastructure probably will not be spent for a long time due to planning, permitting, arguing over priorities, and red tape, Personally I would be very careful about making investments based on this bill that probably won't pass in the first place, Just an opinion from a skeptic when it comes to government spending."

04/05/2021,stocks,Seriously!!
04/05/2021,stocks,"US steel is not one of the big boys in the US despite the name. 

What Im curious about is why analysts never seem to mention CLF the literal biggest vertically integrated steel supplier in the US right now.

Thats also why i think CLF is very undervalued because it seems no major analysts have caught on yet. Everything else is already pretty mega pumped."
04/05/2021,stocks,Won't they use Chinese steel?
04/05/2021,stocks,There is nothing to indicate it wont pass. Printing money benefits the asset owning rich (congress and the senate).

People still think it’s gonna happen? Yikes."
04/05/2021,stocks,"Definitely this. Some have complained about the pork barrel spending. Political and governmental comments aside, the play on pork barrel spending could be whichever pet companies the Congress is invested in.  

Towards that end, there was a site making the rounds recently which tracked congressional stock holdings, maybe this one? https://senatestockwatcher.com/ Something to look into for sure."

04/05/2021,stocks,"My thought exactly. I’m not rushing in, every politician seems to promise this one when they’re on the campaign trail..."
04/05/2021,stocks,Probably more money to be made in companies that will profit from the pork than the infrastructure. Although personally I do not think the bill will pass. Every President tries and they all fail. Biden does not have the massive benefit of overwhelming majorities in the House and Senate that Obama had for his first two years and his infrastructure plan was a flop.
04/05/2021,stocks,"So vanguard etfs and spy, got it."
04/05/2021,stocks,"Great website that shows Congress insider trading:

04/05/2021,stocks,GME has already squeezed. The short ratio is still high but it's no where near where it was. We might see some minor volatility to come but the trend will be down from here on out
04/05/2021,stocks,"Not technical or financial analysis, but if extremely rural places that don't have fast enough internet access were to gain that access, than there would be more ppl playing multiplayer games (which tend to be more profitable due to microtransactions).

04/05/2021,stocks,Yes. I can only use 1tb worth of data before I get heavily penalized with a huge fee. Or I could pay a crud ton more per month to have a higher limit or unlimited.  I already pay 90$ per month now for 150/10. It is never actually that fast.

04/05/2021,stocks,"I completely agree and in particular think this is a scenario where waiting for more info is the right call even if it means missing maybe some absolutely bottom price somewhere. However, I personally believe that this infrastructure plan is the necessary piece to actually get Biden/Dems to capture the next term. He's fulfilled on some promises already, but nothing that's still going to be remembered in 3 years time.

But it's not going to get close to happening before the fall. So this feels more like a watchlist scenario than a buy in."
04/05/2021,stocks,"You have that backwards. Nothing is free, and the rich pay a ton of money to avoid taxes. That leaves the middle class to pay. Maybe not directly through taxes but, have you heard about all the user fees they are considering and looking for more? That will hurt middle and lower income people more than the rich, just like sales tax does. Not to mention gas prices and higher utility bills."

04/05/2021,stocks,For sure I can see that. Betting on govt action in general is pretty frustrating though.
04/05/2021,stocks,"Depends on where you live. Most expensive areas are already paying $15 or more. But if you live in an area with lower costs in general two things could happen. Prices go up to cover, or some employees get the raise and others get the boot to be able to pay it. Just because somebody owns a business doesn't mean they are wealthy. Competition for workers should be what dictates what they get paid. Also, many places have higher minimum wages than the Federal minimum. I live in Alaska, prices are higher and so are wages."

04/05/2021,stocks,"**Daily Stock Market Forecast**

Today is about as bullish as it can physically possibly be.

The [job report](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/u-s-gains-916-000-new-jobs-in-march-and-signals-strengthening-economy-11617367042?mod=home-page) exceeded expectations.

We are in a full breakout. You can [draw a triangle](https://i.redd.it/0xymvakltcr61.png) around our recent correction and you'll see that stock values have bounced between those lines. As of Thursday, we have fully busted out of that triangle and are rocketing upward, and, as of open, we have broken through our last resistance line.

Today's going to be a beautiful day.

I'm forecasting a **green day** with a NASDAQ **high of 13,754** and a **low of 13,598.**

04/05/2021,stocks,Want to buy a share of AMZN. Wondering whether i should buy it now in anticipation of another rally day or wait for a slight pullback. Long run shouldnt matter much esp as its been trading sideways for months but def doesnt hurt to try to get a cheaper entry

04/05/2021,stocks,"What are you thoughts about owning only blue chip stocks like Google, Microsoft, Apple, TSM, Visa?

It seems to me to be the best way to make good profit with little risk. They go up alot faster then average stocks and they are consistent with the returns. If i would go with a safer stock in long term i would get less return and even if the blue chip stock drops after holding it for a while, it probably would still be worth more then the safer stocks."

04/05/2021,stocks,Very unlikely to outpace the market anytime soon... if ever.
04/05/2021,stocks,"Yep, looks like a bunch of stocks rode up in pre-market and then sold off at open. Hopefully they'll climb back up soon."
04/05/2021,stocks,Lol woof
04/05/2021,stocks,"IPOs almost always go down over the first several months. If you think it's a good company, just hold on"
04/05/2021,stocks,Chewy is the way to go
04/05/2021,stocks,"FAANG popping off is probably causing it. And based off how poorly most of my other small growth stocks are doing today, it seems to be big money being moved from the smaller ones to the big ones."
04/05/2021,stocks,The FAANG have been flat since august they are finally rejoining the rally.
04/05/2021,stocks,Yep. I’m taking profits today. This is not natural.
04/05/2021,stocks,Do you know how much cruise lines are losing each day?
04/05/2021,stocks,"I'm banking on Cruise Lines too, I think they'll be big once things open up, but they're definitely hemorrhaging money right now. Don't think I'll celebrate until they're actually running again..."
04/05/2021,stocks,"Kinda starting to feel the same lol. I am glad that my portfolio is rebounding but the last months showed how much it sucks when everything is plummeting and you don’t have spare capital to capitalize. I basically made my big start to proper investing in late January so I didn’t have enough spare capital to comfortably keep buying dips and largely just had to sit on my holdings outside of rebalancing and grabbing a bunch of VTI shares when it was 198-200. 

It’s made me generally less eager to try and snap things up when everything is blasting and instead just sit back and watch my current holdings rip while looking to build capital for the next time things pull back a bit. Even when the market generally trends up, it just feels better to buy something you trust when it’s down. One of my favorite purchases recently was TGT when I got it at sub-180. It was a ticker I was interested in and it actually took a notable dip. It’s since recovered and I’ve gotten to enjoy all the upside for it."
04/05/2021,stocks,I started off +1% and have been dropping steadily since market open. At this rate I'm expecting to end slightly negative today :-/
04/05/2021,stocks,"In a correction small cap growth stocks usually get hit first then they're last to recover. 

I'm in the green today because of Google, Amazon, and Tesla but the smaller caps are doing their best to spoil the party."
04/05/2021,stocks,AAPL seems healthy
04/05/2021,stocks,"Mine broke even today. I'm longterm on it, but still is nice to not lose money"
04/05/2021,stocks,Because it's no longer in vogue now that the economy is reopening.
04/05/2021,stocks,AMD is green by a thread. I was told there would be cake!
04/05/2021,stocks,"This is because the leak was  from 2019, it's old news as far as investors are concerned"
04/05/2021,stocks,Because nobody is going to leave FB because of it.
04/05/2021,stocks,Damn. What stocks do you have lol
04/05/2021,stocks,How though.
04/05/2021,stocks,Me too. I'm only 1.1% up today while bag-holding some stocks that are just dumping today.
04/05/2021,stocks,There might be bad (for AMZN) news about the union vote in the next couple of days that could cause a little dip.
04/05/2021,stocks,u can buy partial shares so maybe buy like .2 of a share over like 2 weeks
04/05/2021,stocks,"Apple is really more of a consumer goods and services company, whereas Microsoft is more of a software/actual tech company IMO. Apple has a lot of business customers for their goods and services, and I think they’ll expand their hardware segment once M1X hits.

I’m not really sure you can say that either one is specifically geared for consumers/businesses, because that distinction is a little dubious. The two companies have very different ways of making money."
04/05/2021,stocks,"Very accurate from their traditional offerings. Microsoft owns enterprise and Apple is dominant in retail and consumerism.

I'm not sure how you figure out which side is better, or if it even matters when talking Apple vs Miscroft. I would say it's easier to penetrate retail than enterprise, though. Good luck training your workforce how to use an Apple computer after they've used Windows and O365 their entire work life. And it's impossible seeing Apple servers ever being a thing unless you work at Apple.

Apple needs EV in order to make another stock boom (I mean boom, the stock will be fine no matter what), but they have enough cash that I wouldn't doubt them."
04/05/2021,stocks,Nah. AWS
04/05/2021,stocks,We are rotating into big tech.
04/05/2021,stocks,I think it was just another victim of today's rotation into big tech.
04/05/2021,stocks,!remindme 1 week
04/05/2021,stocks,"PYPL, Z"
04/05/2021,stocks,"Roku hand's down, just search this sub for the quality DD, then go on Finviz and read through all their news... they've been crushing it and are set to dominate a market that is only mid-game (not too young that we are guessing, Roku already spent the money to ""win"" and has won, but not end game so plenty of room to run and still gain name brand stage), and it's far from its ATH which was during a very good earnings report, but then they got crushed along with the rest of the market and people needing/wanting to liquidify gains.

It's also a stock that seems very popular among trusted investors who are looking more at a 5 year timeframe than the shorter timeframes that are currently a mess of volatility. Roku's not going anywhere, in fact they already gave guidance that they are going to beat earnings again for Q1."
04/05/2021,stocks,Etsy
04/05/2021,stocks,ADBE
04/05/2021,stocks,Why would you buy Viacom? I mean if the nightly news rustles your jimmies then by all means.
04/05/2021,stocks,I’m still invested so you should’ve waited. It’ll probably dip to $35 with me around.
04/05/2021,stocks,"I don't think we'll see a sell off

Facebook is growing in users and revenue rapidly. Im definitely not selling my shares"
04/05/2021,stocks,I have 5 shares lmao. I think I'll keep those for a decade or so.
04/05/2021,stocks,To infinity and beyond
04/05/2021,stocks,You could buy those and go to sleep for 30 years. Those are amazing companies and will be dominate for years to come.
04/05/2021,stocks,"It is fun to buy individual stocks and I have done that myself. But the more I look at my portfolio, the more I realize I should just have money in VOO, QQQ and DIA. The companies you mention are all blue chip stocks and I own some blue chip stocks myself. On a given day they will outperform the market, but I suspect over the long term even with blue chips, it is just smarter to own the index funds."
04/05/2021,stocks,"Sold my msft position today. But I'm swinging so whatevs. Its ATH.
If you want to buy in I'd wait for a pullback."
04/05/2021,stocks,The highs are never high enough and the lows are always too low.
04/05/2021,stocks,Not really haha
04/05/2021,stocks,I'm down 2%
04/05/2021,stocks,"Good job having the patience to weather the fluctuation.  If you believed in the stock, holding was the right play rather than panic selling."
04/05/2021,stocks,"i bought NVDA 505 call, and I thought the market was gonna tank, and sold it for minimal profit.

Since I sold, one contract gained $3000 in value due to biden euphoria

i always leave money on the table."
04/05/2021,stocks,That’s amazing!! Congrats. Take those fucking profits and don’t look back or roll over into new calls.
04/05/2021,stocks,Wish I bought more of each. When I break even on some of my growth stocks I'ma cash out and buy more.
04/05/2021,stocks,"Feeling good, out of ARK, lol. Had 2 positions (9/2020 & 2/2021 lol) netted about 15% overall."
04/05/2021,stocks,At this point is ICLN a buy?
04/05/2021,stocks,Leaked personal data is all the rage these days $$$$
04/05/2021,stocks,"Not all green energy sources are equal, and prices are still on the high side relative to earnings *and* growth."
04/05/2021,stocks,When you say future I hope you mean years from now. ICLN looks like it’s run it’s short term course
04/05/2021,stocks,"look up the youtuber ""inthemoney"" on one of his videos on coverd calls/wheel strategy, he links to an excel document you can use. it's very straightforward and free."
04/05/2021,stocks,AAPL covered calls are solid income
04/05/2021,stocks,"We are just rotation into large caps, might be a while before you see it paying off."
04/05/2021,stocks,I’m in QQQJ and small cap indices. QQQJ hasn’t shown any gains for me yet. But I’m optimistic. I think it’s a good ETF. Small cap indicies have been good for me.
04/05/2021,stocks,I don't think that volatility is done with.
04/05/2021,stocks,"Bro, don’t worry. There will be many more opportunities. It sucks though. I hear you for real. I’ve been on microviosion’s rollercoaster since early February and could have made over 200% just from the fluctuations. I really hope that A sample blows this thing past the stratosphere so I can finally feel like this wasn’t for nothing"
04/05/2021,stocks,"The market can still crash in the next few weeks, S&P 500 continues to rise at insane valuations. The S&P 500 is up 10% in the last 3 months.."
04/05/2021,stocks,"Same. I could have doubled my MSFT holdings and didn’t. Luckily, I put it in mostly good places. But I regret not following my plans."
04/05/2021,stocks,Why
04/05/2021,stocks,CHWY
04/05/2021,stocks,I’d consider PSFE a good buy right now. I continue to accumulate
04/05/2021,stocks,Nio at $40 isn't terrible.
04/05/2021,stocks,DKNG maybe
04/05/2021,stocks,"Perhaps profit taking from Wednesday/Thursday rallies? Also it's a holiday for a lot of people, not everyone is playing the market today."
04/05/2021,stocks,Euhm my stocks are all flying i don’t see a selloff at all.
04/05/2021,stocks,"Etsy has the best financials tho i wouldn't say speculative.
The rest yeah."
04/05/2021,stocks,Picked one up the other day and already up 200 bucks!!
04/05/2021,stocks,Rates are down and dollar index is down.
04/05/2021,stocks,OPEC agreed to increasing production levels slowly.
04/05/2021,stocks,Big rotation into large caps atm.
04/05/2021,stocks,Energy stocks are explanation
04/05/2021,stocks,Is FAANG driving Nasdaq? Seems like a lot of the smaller/speculative tech stocks are all down today. Yet Nasdaq up 1.5%
04/05/2021,stocks,Really weird given that the Russell's futures were up by like 2% last night.
04/05/2021,stocks,"down. makes me sad. bought some more lol.

Even with Bidens plan Oil will come back as travel does."
04/05/2021,stocks,"OPEC meeting last week. Production cuts are going to start being rolled over so more production, not enough demand yet."
04/05/2021,stocks,Yes. I use Fidelity and their main app and I can buy fractional shares.
04/05/2021,stocks,"They've got 2 mobile apps, so maybe their newer one (Spire?) has it; I don't really use either, though. Not a fan of their apps."
04/05/2021,stocks,Seems like old news as far as AAPL is concerned. LG stopped being a serious competitor years ago.
04/05/2021,stocks,Apple is having a lot of bullish sentiment lately. I believe we will see a a lot of action going into the next earnings.
04/05/2021,stocks,"That explains the upward trend...
The ONE time I go all in on Options Apple decides to be a bully."
04/05/2021,stocks,Or past due rent and utilities plus some meme stocks...  I am liking AMZN though.
04/05/2021,stocks,"It's absolutely amazing, for bond yields"
04/05/2021,stocks,[deleted]
04/05/2021,stocks,Here’s to regaining the money I lost buying 10 shares at $135 lol
04/05/2021,stocks,"It's not like the pandemic caused the majority of Americans to change their lifestyles to be healthier.  Americans will continue to be diagnosed with obesity, diabetes, cancer, etc.

In my opinion, nothing has changed for the healthcare stocks.  If anything, they could even grow higher if the long term effects of Covid on the body start to cause problems later in life."
04/05/2021,stocks,Something something rocket
04/05/2021,stocks,"I got out of ICLN a few weeks ago at a 10% loss. Hated to do it, but I have 0 faith in it now. Its gone down since then, and I used those funds on stocks that are up 5% now. Extremely happy I did it. If it's still down even now, then I'm even more confident in my decision."
04/05/2021,stocks,Just wait. Fundamentals are ok.
04/05/2021,stocks,Bulls have been roaring since last week.
04/05/2021,stocks,Not sure but got out of my position. There were some union talks lately and i guess it may be a bit volatile
04/05/2021,stocks,I like GenZ investor on YouTube. He goes through weekly picks looking at both price and fundamentals.
04/05/2021,stocks,Tomorrow is already promised green. It’s up 5% in the after hours lmao
04/05/2021,stocks,Right here! This thing is literally a bull machine moving like 8-10% a day with basically no drops. 40$ eow!
04/05/2021,stocks,"This thing guna grow to the size of Dicks? You know, big ole' dicks?"
04/05/2021,stocks,They are both already massive. How much more do you think those behemoths can grow without being broken up.
04/05/2021,stocks,Not a huge fan of WMT but that dip was too tempting. Cheers!
04/05/2021,stocks,Bought HD in that same dip and couldn’t be happier.
04/05/2021,stocks,mommy's stocks are 5 years hold
04/05/2021,stocks,Cathie herself says 5 years for her funds. Also people like her actively hire and promote people who will follow her goals.
04/05/2021,stocks,"I bought BJ at near its ATH, and at one point was down about 20ish%. Pretty much never green. Reevaluated the company, deemed it risky (significant debt) but still worth the play. Right before they released their last QR, I doubled my position. Now comfortably in the black."
04/05/2021,stocks,"OSTK, $30 down to $3 up to $120.

I wouldn't recommend doing that.  CEO was a bona fide crazy person and the only thing that saved the company was a global health disaster.  For a year prior to the parabolic recovery they were trying to give away their online store, but nobody would take it off their hands."
04/05/2021,stocks,You can try being up 420% again next year.
04/05/2021,stocks,IMO ABNB is fantastic at any price at this point. The company almost has a monopoly on travel destinations...I know people still use hotels but Millenials and younger generations always use ABNB and it is the present and future. Just do it.
04/05/2021,stocks,Love the company. Hate the price and current valuation. I want to make an entry but won’t be doing it at this price
04/05/2021,stocks,Short term?? That’s a long term play!!
04/05/2021,stocks,Hold VOO as long as possible
04/05/2021,stocks,Why....
04/05/2021,stocks,I'm waiting for a slight pullback. I missed it a couple weeks ago.
04/05/2021,stocks,"put it rhis way. I Put it in at like ATH on January. Feb and March was rough but today Im above where I was in January.

Put it in and forget it"
04/05/2021,stocks,I dumped 6K into my account.  Invested 3K in VTI and held 3K for inevitable corrections.
04/05/2021,stocks,Wait for the next red day and then just dump it in.  DCA is a form of trying to time the market which is less successful than time in the market.  Unless you're into that kinda thing.
04/05/2021,stocks,It really depends on whether or not you want the increased risk of basically saying that this one company will outperform the index. My personal opinion is that it’s perfectly sane to have all 3.
04/05/2021,stocks,One benefit if you plan on holding 100+ shares is that you can then sell covered calls on MSFT and AAPL to act as an extra dividend. I do this a lot.
04/05/2021,stocks,"go in on a pullback

i'd be surprised if the market doesn't pull back a little this week.

if you're gonna do QQQ, might as well do TQQQ, since it looks like we're heading back to nasdaq all time highs again with all the euphoria this month.

and it's earnings season again. Shit will be grinding up"
04/05/2021,stocks,"In most situations, lump sum works best. However, the market has been heavily green for a few days in a row, so maybe half and then wait? Ultimately, in the long wrong it will likely make little difference."
04/05/2021,stocks,Put half of it in tomorrow. And then begin averaging down.
04/05/2021,stocks,I added some baba this morning.
04/05/2021,stocks,ER date is 4-20. It’s bounced back strongly from its recent dip. I think another leg up is going to depend on the report and outlook. I’m hoping to get in on a post ER dip. Good long term value.
04/05/2021,stocks,Spot prices for uranium are rising . All uranium related stocks shot up at least 5% across the board. What's making you think it's a pump and dump ?
04/05/2021,stocks,I wonder this myself
04/05/2021,stocks,"It makes sense though, right? Everyone assumed a dip so they piled on. Plus FB was already a Buy generally speaking."
04/05/2021,stocks,With gains as incredible as that I would sell ASAP. I am not a financial advisor so take what I say with a grain of salt but I’d sell.
04/05/2021,stocks,Nobody knows... Last Wednesday and Thursday were very nice green days for me. I hope for the same rally today :)
04/05/2021,stocks,SPY
04/05/2021,stocks,psfe deserves a look.
04/05/2021,stocks, If i felt emotions it would bring a tear to my eye.
04/05/2021,stocks,The whole energy sector is taking a dive. However come May the infrastructure plan should bring em back.
04/05/2021,stocks,OPEC increasing production and increasing prices to Asian customers
04/05/2021,stocks,"I hear nothing but good things about ARRY, and it was one of my favourite stocks for months, yet it has been absolute trash for two months now.

Usually it doesn't fall as much as other solar stocks but today it decided to drop twice as much as TAN just to tick me off.

I will continue to hold out of spite."
04/05/2021,stocks,Here’s a tip that will save you money. Don’t buy US solar companies. It’s hard for them to make money and they can’t compete with the Chinese. They pretty much just rise and fall with US subsidies.
04/05/2021,stocks,Tqqq
04/05/2021,stocks,"buy calls with it. MRVL, AMD, NRG, GNOG... or if you want REALLY risky buy calls of AMC. Or buy puts on BBY."
04/05/2021,stocks,look at the morning gapper penny stocks.
04/05/2021,stocks,The act (activation) price is the price that the order will begin filling at.  The limit price is the lowest price you are willing to pay for it.  So if you have a stop limit for $30 and $35 activation to sell 100 shares of XYZ it will fill as many as it can once it hits $35 down to $30.  If it sells only 50 shares before it hits $30 it will stop filling orders until it goes back up to $30 again and begin selling the other 50.

04/05/2021,stocks,Buy spxs today.
04/05/2021,stocks,Fuck that dude
04/05/2021,stocks,"Yep, that narrative is over."
04/05/2021,stocks,They crushed the delivery numbers for Q1
04/05/2021,stocks,Deliveries surprised to the upside on Friday and the market was closed so the reaction couldn't happen then.
04/05/2021,stocks,"Huge beat on q1 deliveries, they crushed the estimates. Tesla bears are lining up for the slaughterhouse today."

04/05/2021,stocks,"There's nothing more American than being ok with your personal data being used by private corporations or the government. Should have been seen as a bullish sign.

04/05/2021,stocks,day aint over though.. been less than an hour... stop claiming victory so quick its like begging for it you know?
04/05/2021,stocks,"Analysts IMO are like so called psychics so say they can predict the future.

1) they cannot even if it’s an educated guess

2) I don’t trust their educated guesses since they are there to make money for HFS not you"
04/05/2021,stocks,"People just have a hate boner for Zuckerberg, don't understand anything about FB's fundamentals, and it probably felt cathartic for them to argue that FB fucked up big time and ""this was the last straw"" or something dumb."
04/05/2021,stocks,"Lol yeah.
Still waiting for pullback. Nice runup"
04/05/2021,stocks,"Came to ask the same thing. It's been correlating with Amazon and Pinterest for awhile now, but it's down 5% today while the other two are +2%.

Probably just means it's a good spot to buy while other stocks start to lose some of their value relative to March lows."
04/05/2021,stocks,I was wondering what's going on with it
04/05/2021,stocks,I read AMD and was happy for a sec lol
04/05/2021,stocks,"Not sure this is the only reason but this is definitely a factor...

The YouTuber who started the whole BNG0 hype did a DD on them today. Every time he does a new stock a lot of people buy in like crazy on the first day."
04/05/2021,stocks,It was down like 10% on Thursday so it’s back where it was on Wednesday last week. No big deal.
04/05/2021,stocks,"I mean it can't just keep going down perpetually, at some point it becomes too cheap!"
04/05/2021,stocks,"Yep. I’m pretty much set on the idea of opening a second account just put a couple thousand on TQQQ, UPRO, and SPXL each and don’t look at it for five years."
04/05/2021,stocks,literally can't go tits up
04/05/2021,stocks,"Very generously priced. Have a look at forward earnings. Don't just buy based on company name and share price. Look at market cap compared to expected earnings. In other words, do your DD"

04/05/2021,stocks,"Lots of Tech growth stocks are down, actually. Not as much as ETSY, but still down, or barely green.

04/05/2021,stocks,FB i would challenge you to find a more impressive financial balance sheet in any established company....the stock market is driven by fundamentals in the long run not wild speculation.
04/05/2021,stocks,Because the company makes gobs of money and has insane growth ahead?
04/05/2021,stocks,That leak happened a while ago. It was just put up on another site but the actual leak was in 2019 iirc
04/05/2021,stocks,Idk but as a shareholder I'm happy about it
04/05/2021,stocks,"Why should it go down? 

That data was already stolen years ago. Wall Street doesn't care what a bunch of editors at Vox think."
04/05/2021,stocks,Nobody cares about privacy.

04/05/2021,stocks,"As general rule of thumb its recommended not to sell unless something fundamentally changed in your thesis.

Market price and day to day movement is irrelevant if you are long.

Also March is known to be red due to first quarter, tax season etc..."
04/05/2021,stocks,"No.

I put a significant amount of effort into trying to create an algorithm that would predict earnings a couple of years ago. I looked at everything I could find that was considered a predictor for earnings results and calculated their accuracy. A drop before the earnings report date was not a significant predictor either way.

Nothing I identified, by the way, was a particularly reliable predictor. The best earnings play is not to play at all."
04/05/2021,stocks,Earnings almost always have a negative impact on stock price.

04/05/2021,stocks,"I think she's overrated as a fund manager, outside of her Tesla bet (which is an absolute bubble) she performs on track with QQQ going back like 6 years. And before that she wasn't anything special as a fund manager either."

04/05/2021,stocks,"Tech Breakout was bound to happend, big institutions fear mongered and bought tech cheap."
04/05/2021,stocks,"Nowhere super useful. Most day traders don't make very much money from it, and the ones that do aren't interested in doing courses to teach how because it takes away from time they can spend researching the markets. And the traders charging money for courses aren't going to teach you anything you can't learn by reading investopedia. Humbled Trader on YouTube has some pretty good videos for beginner day trading. But you're probably best off reading books"

04/05/2021,stocks,"the young generations favourite social media is tiktok tho, Snapchat is not that popular anymore"
04/05/2021,stocks,"If you're calling them the 'young generations,' I'd recommend actually asking some people in that group. Pretty sure their growth rate is declining, though they may have potential in other global markets."
04/05/2021,stocks,"Snapchat isn't cool anymore.

I still use it though."
04/05/2021,stocks,"Thats a risky play, I do hope it works out for you.

My bear case for snap is that its business model doesn't leave much room for profitability. They don't run ads in the same way nearly every other social media does, only promotional posts from news/blogs/influencers. I think if Snap can find a solid revenue stream then it will do very well, but it isn't exactly set up for that right now


EDIT: Why are people downvoting tyler? You may not think it's a good stock but that doesn't mean OP's comment is bad"
04/05/2021,stocks,It's all tiktok now
04/05/2021,stocks,Wow...out of all the stocks you YOLO Snapchat? Why? At least slowly average into it instead of dumping it all in there at once...
04/05/2021,stocks,"Not just users, but mega revenues.  I think they came in 0.99 billion last quarter and would have broken a billion if not for a blip.  I think that makes them (quietly) number three for social media plays.

With re-opening driving loads of advertising, the coming quarter should also have strong revenue.  

SNAP's net could be better, but they're redirecting revenue into attracting people to the platform.  It sounds like a questionable idea, but apparently it's been working like gangbusters for getting quality advertisers.  

Also, today's price action notwithstanding, there's a trend away from toxic social media (Facebook, Instagram) and toward the more harmless, family friendly social media (SNAP, PINS). Advertisers don't want their money spent just to find out their ad is accompanying hate speech or insurrection, they rather put it somewhere where controversy would burn their dollars."
04/05/2021,stocks,":O can you give me suggestions please..how does one have that much balls to just drop in 1 stock at one shot ? genuinely asking, please..suggestions :) if you can, maybe give your age range or income. or any range is fine if you dont want to share specific details."
04/05/2021,stocks,"I disagree. I think Monday will be a slow day. Not to forget a lot of people are still on holiday, not everyone is playing the market today."
04/05/2021,stocks,You're killing it with Tesla and are thinking about the doomers making stupid posts on reddit instead of being happy and positive and enjoying your earnings?

04/05/2021,stocks,memestock stuff is on /r/wallstreetbets
04/05/2021,stocks,Meme stocks are for gambling not investing. Analysis doesn’t work for these stocks.
04/05/2021,stocks,"Huh, I would think with COVID slowing down in the states, more people would go back to gyms, perhaps this would lead the stock to go down some. 

But with this stock market it would probably shoot up lol."
04/05/2021,stocks,"Because it's a speculative company with $238,000 in revenue for 2020 but with a valuation of billions of dollars that promises to make the money back somehow in 2030. Good luck."
04/05/2021,stocks,The new tax hike is going to leave the corporate tax rate lower than it's been at any point in modern American history except for the past 3 years. I think these corporations are going to do just fine.
04/05/2021,stocks,"I hope so.  I have about half of my portfolio on VTI for slow and stead gains.  ETFs like SOXL, PAVE, and XLF I have multiples"
04/05/2021,stocks,Boy I hope so because I have 500 shares of ARKK and 500 of ARKG. ;)

04/05/2021,stocks,"Do you already have a stop loss sell limit in place or any kind of other limit sell order?  If so, you can't initiate another sell order since those would compete. 

You can go in and cancel any other existing orders for that stock and then you should be able to sell."

04/05/2021,stocks,It's down 1%?
04/05/2021,stocks,"A lot of these were heavily diluted, especially airlines and cruises, don’t let the low prices fool you. 30$ today could be what 50$ was pre-covid. They might not have as much room to recover as you would think looking at the charts.   If you don’t know about dilution I would read up on it."
04/05/2021,stocks,"Reasons it could be a while:

* until a serious majority of people are vaccinated both doses, things can't reopen all the way, and that's still going to take time.

* once things reopen, months will need to go by until earnings reports are all out reflecting the change in statistics

* there could be a lot of ""things are inflated with this post covid rush"" priced in and a lot of profit taking after these reports so it could take 2 or 3 quarters for things to stabilize

That said, in not making a hard prediction. The stock market is a casino and things could bubble really fast with the first states starting to gear up for reopen as people get hyped and price in expectation of an immediate resurgence. Nobody knows for sure what will happen."
04/05/2021,stocks,Arent most already above pre covid levels?
04/05/2021,stocks,"Many cruise lines won't go back to pre-Covid travel this year. They aren't only active in the US, and there won't be much cruising in e.g. Europe this year...

Also, many of them reduced fleet sizes and won't be able to reach past revenue and earnings for a long time. It could take years for the cruise industry to truly recover. 

That doesn't mean shares won't go up simply because people believe in them, but they could also go down once it becomes clear that cruise companies aren't what they used to be. It's really a gamble."
04/05/2021,stocks,Remember to watch debt! Some companies got a lot of debt while idling. And also lockdowns and 4th wave in europe (it's Easter now so gonna probably explode again next week)
04/05/2021,stocks,"it’s honestly not risky, they completely dominate multiple markets. I used to work with them and bought through their ESPP. For years I had 100% of my portfolio AAPL and made decent money. I bought hundreds of apple shares for $25 each.. Possibly the best stock to hold on the market :)"
04/05/2021,stocks,"Oh absolutely.  I'm geeked and finding small goals to celebrate along the way.  Rest assured the last 3 months have sucked based on what I see for everyone but damn what a shit time for new investors.  So for me, after the last few months, 1.3% has me over the fucking moon today."

04/05/2021,stocks,Be patient. As I mentioned it took almost two years to really pay off from 2014. I think once MSFT crosses 2 trillion and FB hits the trillion it’ll help and the market will let it run. Once they release the new VR it’s a wrap. All aboard. There’s nothing like an Apple bull run.
04/05/2021,stocks,Right? As someone who has held from right after the 2014 split it’s eerily familiar. I bought in 2014 at $100 a share. It went to 115-120 and I thought I was a god. Then a tech selloff! Analysts bashing it left and right! It’s too big! It’s almost worth a trillion!! It’s too much!!! It ended up trickling down to mid 60’s and I was like oh no what did I do??? It took two solid years before it crept up to 200 and another 3 to get to 300. In fact it was like 290 February 2020. Then the VID hit and bang back to 212. Then from April to September 212 to 535.
04/05/2021,stocks,Damn you timed that nicely. Good job.
04/05/2021,stocks,"give me an example, why do calls go up so much as compared to stocks?

mrvl is up 28 percent since early march so why is your call up over 200 percent??"
04/05/2021,stocks,please make it red. I want more.
04/05/2021,stocks,Why do you think that?
04/05/2021,stocks,"My only red stock is ETSY, everything else is up over 1% except ETSY -2% and getting worse as the minutes go by.

04/05/2021,stocks,Give them to your kids. I got my IBM stock from my old man. Damn thing is one a piece of paper
04/05/2021,stocks,That's exactly what i want. I think my plan would be to buy individual stocks for a while and then slowly add into a safer etf like QQQ and then a even safer etf like VTI later in life.
04/05/2021,stocks,"Yeah, it's riskier to go for individual stocks but you can make alot more then QQQ for example. I bought QQQ, Apple and Google at the same time during the covid and i made 85% with Google and Apple while QQQ is at 55% without paying fees like an ETF. That's the reason why i rather go for individial stocks as a new investor just because i'm young and i can afford more risk. Also the bigger amount there is in the market at the start is of course gonna have a huge impact later on."
04/05/2021,stocks,I won't be buying in since i have almost 15% of my portfolio in it.
04/05/2021,stocks,"Yeah, I've dropped .4 since posting that."
04/05/2021,stocks,My trust in WMT was gone. Today was the only day during the entire time that it moved so much so quickly. I anticipate a drop between now and next Friday. I hate waiting until the last minute on options. And most importantly I learned a long time ago that a 20% gain is something to be happy with no matter how much better one could have done if only foresight worked the same as hindsight.
04/05/2021,stocks,"My rule of thumb with options is to gain 20%. I choose not to kick myself when I accomplish that, no matter how much better I could have done. Had I a month or more before the target date I might have looked into riding it longer. But less than 2 weeks makes me too nervous."

04/05/2021,stocks,"My sibling called the landlord to give notice because they bought a house and were moving out. They had sent notice earlier but hadn't gotten a response so was confirming. They found out they had been one of the only tenants paying rent during COVID. This guy is not a mega corp, just a regular dude with a few properties. He said he was just happy it was a move out and not a, ""I can't pay no more"", so he can hopefully put another payer in there. Crazy. I'm thinking most are thinking they will never pay it back... that's like a year+ of overdue rent. They will just get kicked out (when it's legal) and find somewhere else to live but that will probably take time to (getting them out)."

Also amazon and google have different areas of growth independent of their current ones and you can’t split up a company for having footholds in multiple different segments of consumerism. 

Both amazon and google have multiple segments outside of their moat they can rely on to fuel for multiple growth. 

Google especially is structured like berkshire as a conglomerate ranging from different areas outside of search. 

In short don’t count on them being split, fined yes but not split."

Also that seems extremely tech heavy, unless you mean those are the ones that down today."
04/05/2021,stocks,"Yeah, unfortunately my bags have an expiration date since I bought deep ITM leaps. They expire in 2022 though. I break even when it hits around 139 I think. Worst case I can afford to exercise them or roll them into 23 though."
04/05/2021,stocks,"Calls cost less than the underlying stock but they expire so there is a lot more risk.  If they go down, you can't hold on to them indefinitely, hoping they turn around. If they expire out of the money they are literally worthless.  If they get in they money, they go up just as many dollars as the underlying security.  
So, let's say you bought AMD calls with an expiration of 4/09 and a strike price of $77.  And you bought them two weeks ago when AMD was at $75.  You could have bought two contracts (worth 200 shares) for $420.  If you let them expire because AMD is worth less than $77 on 4/09, and you held onto them then you lose your $420.  Every last penny.  If AMD goes up so do your options contracts.  Two option contracts for AMD allow you to buy 200 shares at $77 a share.  Instant profit (as of today's close) of $860 minus your original premium of $420.  Double your money."

Right now, and for the foreseeable future, the costs to produce green energy are EXTREMELY high.

It might be profitable, but if it doesn't outpace the market, then there's really no point in investing in it."

04/05/2021,stocks,I have SQ calls that's prolly why
04/05/2021,stocks,I meant holding when it was down was the right move.  I would've done the same thing you did of taking a profit before the option expires.  You also get some time value by selling now instead of waiting until expiration.  It can easily go up or down in the next 2 weeks even if the stock is a good long term hold.  26% gain is great for a 1 month investment.

04/05/2021,stocks,"ohhhhhh! Ok. So lets see. 

So to break even on the 2 calls you bough, the stock would have to hit 77$. And for every dollar it goes up, each call goes up 100 because each share goes up a dollar? So you have 2 calls(200 shares). This means that since AMD closed at 81.43 which is $4.43 dollars above $77, that your 200 shares gained $4.43 each which = $886? You said $860.

Is this correct?

Also, is this how every call works? That if it hits the strike price, every buck is a $100 for your call?"

04/05/2021,stocks,"Yes, that's how it works.  I looked at the aftermarket price of $81.30, sorry.

04/05/2021,stocks,"During COVID there was a law/order put in place to make it so people couldn't get kicked out if they couldn't pay rent. The landlords could apply for assistance to get reimbursed what they would have been getting but it doesn't mean you would always get it or the full amount. Of course anything like this could be abused by those that could pay but just didn't want to but it was there to assist all the people getting laid off. In theory you still owe that rent (I'm guessing for the amounts the landlord didn't get reimbursed for, each application had to be for a specific tenant so it was tracked) so it would dissuade people from abusing but I doubt they will ever have to pay it. I don't know all the intricacies of how it worked but I think there was assistance for the property owners but I'm sure mega corps made sure to get to that cash flow first. My apartment building (owned by a corporation) sent out many emails asking people that couldn't pay rent to contact them (and not just not pay) so they could fill out some forms to get this money."
04/05/2021,stocks,"Due to Covid landlords were not allowed to evict tenants for not paying rent. As far as help for landlords, they were protected from foreclosure or having their utilities Turned off. I can only speak to my mother's situation, but there was no assistance available to her to cover lost rent because she is an individual renting out her duplex and not a business. The eviction and foreclosure parts are still in effect, but she is having to make payment arrangements for the utilities right now. (Utilities were included in the rent of the tenants). Personally I do not believe that people who didn't pay their rent are going to suddenly going to come up with  a year's rent and bail her out, so she is stuck. She also has huge penalties for not being able to pay her property taxes for last year yet and has to come up with that with no consideration being given for lost rent. She is 85 and lives on Social Security and rent, Her Social Security is less than her utilities..."

04/05/2021,stocks,what does that have to do with anything? above comment is right correct?

The problem is, holding this expensive stock prevents me from purchasing more blue chips and ETFs. Having 0 dividend is another thing. 

Would it be a mistake to sell GOOGL now? If I sold it, I would buy some ETFs that have a fair share of GOOGL in it, but not too reliant on IT&Tech. I already own enough of those and I would like to buy more blue chips I already own (JNJ, PG, WMT to name a few) and also look for dividend-paying ETFs (currently own VIG).

I held it for many years which also prevented me from buying other promising stocks. Some of which did quite well, some didn't. Added more Google stock. Stock split. Ten years ago I sold half to put towards a condo. Sold that for a 6 figure profit after holding for two years. Sold a few more to live in a new city for a year without having to work. Bought more Google stock. My return on Google is 729.80% and 721.80% on Alphabet. I could say I wish I never sold any but it helped me LIVE well. Isn't that the point of investing?

Google has an absolute Monopoly on Search engines in the western world (give or take a little bit of BING ect), the own youtube, they maybe make the run with self driving with waymo, and have other investements.

Bearcase:
The burn a lot of money with projects that lead nowhere
no dividend and no voting rights that matter (50% is the founders, no matter how much stock you own)

I think it will be compounding over the long run, a lot of cashflow will be burned on the hobbyprojects of the company but eventually some will work out.

Alphabet might have a bunch of investments going for them, but it's very unsure if those will ever move the needle. 

They make something like 130bn+ in revenue just because of advertising. This includes google search, youtube and other google apps.

Their cloud business has been growing decently in the past, but they are only the third largest player behind amazon and microsoft. 

Their hardware business is quite sobering. 

They had to pay 3 antitrust fines in europe already and are facing a lawsuit with the DOJ in the US.

Looking at multiples, the company doesn't look cheap. They have a price to sales ratio of about 10 and a PE ratio of about 36.

I also did a dcf valuation a few months ago and the fair value is at about $1800 per share with my assumptions. 

So IMO if you are buying Alphabet, you are betting on Google beeing able to keep their monopolies via Google Search, YouTube and Android, plus one of their many investment projects will be a gamer changer.

It's definetly a great company, but the price already incorporates quite optimistic views.

Just to be clear, I am neutral on the stock, I just think there are better risk-reward opportunities out there."
04/05/2021,stocks,"Yes it would be a mistake

04/05/2021,stocks,"You can consider selling some of your shares or going fractional too. Diversification is good but you should only be selling out completely if your sentiment on the company changes.

Edit to add: I bought 1000 shares of MSFT back in 2013. As it ramped up, I started selling bits of it at a time to diversify. I'm happy that I did because I pushed that money into other strong, growing companies but I still hold a lot of MSFT and that was the right choice."
04/05/2021,stocks,I’m about the same % return but I would never sell and I have just 1 share
04/05/2021,stocks,It's doubled in value over the last 12 months. Hold it!

04/05/2021,stocks,"As bigger it is as louder it falls. The risk you assume with just one stock, in comparison of 10/15 other well diversified stocks...i think is bigger by the fact, as much they are valued, more eyes are behind, more speculation...Anyway is a flagship that have different markets and has their cache. I don't understand too much but i prefer mid term OTC than an already Tier 1 stock. The probability that they go down is higher than still being number top 5 over and over."

04/05/2021,stocks,">I think it will be compounding over the long run, a lot of cashflow will be burned on the hobbyprojects

I have mixed feelings on this. On one hand, I fully agree with you.

On the other... I look at these as R&D projects that are essential to growth and culture that other companies aren't taking. If 1 out of 10 of those projects hits, they will hit big and pay for the 9 that failed fast without a problem.

The killedbygoogle site is cute, but says nothing for business cost/value. Even if consumers loved a project, if it isn't making money, why should google continue to support it? 

I have a bigger concern that google doesn't seem to know how to make money other than through ads. 

Unfortunately, I/we don't know how much is being wasted on those projects vs the potential for one of them to hit big."
04/05/2021,stocks,Can’t argue with that :O
04/05/2021,stocks,I just wish they could take that research and actually execute a product with it. They need some cohesiveness and less real world A/B testing.  They can't even figure out a fucking messaging app.  They have their OS running on billions of devices and let WhatsApp and iMessage eat their lunch.  Disgraceful.
04/05/2021,stocks,Good points. In response to the P/E I feel a little more comfortable buying google than other big tech companies at a higher ratio because they're not as leveraged. They have the cash and ability to leverage themselves into a heavyweight in anything they want to pursue in the future.
04/05/2021,stocks,what about buybacks
04/05/2021,stocks,what hasn't doubled in the last 12 months...
04/05/2021,stocks,"Same company in 2015 google restructured into alphabet to become a conglomerate rather than everything under google. 

So alphabet encompasses:

Google (android, youtube, search, map etc..)
Waymo
Verily
Nest 
Calico
G finance (has many investment holdings here)

There is more but you can google the rest if you want more in depth then that."
04/05/2021,stocks,"I don’t hold any, but it’s definitely one of the tech stocks to have as they have their hand in multiple venues and their presence and reach can’t be ignored. . They have risen 21% YTD my question would be if you took money out and invested in the other stocks do you think those are at good entry points ? We haven’t had a permanent correction or something that stuck there is just too much cash flowing into tech so any 10-15% correction is just bought up in a week or two."
04/05/2021,stocks,"I see that as a negative actually. Debt in general is cheaper than equity and they can get it for as low as 1%. They only took on like $20bn last year and that was mostly to help other businesses?/communities? through covid. (I don't remember exactly what it was for)

It's also a shame that they are stacking so much cash. They make very small returns on their cash because it's mostly in safe securities like bonds. To me it feels like they have a hard time finding good projects to make good use of so much cash. 

That could be the reason why they bought back like $30bn worth of shares last year.

At least they already increased their R&D heavily and invested much in PPE for data centers. 

Btw they are only making small acquisitions. Everyone always says Google is buying everything. Which is kind of true. They are buying talent at early stages, but they are not really buying mid to large sized businesses. Their largest acquisition in most recent years was FitBit for $2bn.

Btw they have $135bn in cash."
04/05/2021,stocks,"I think the buybacks in 2020 were reasonable. They bought below my estimated fair value and the stock went up. So a good timing so to say. 

Then again, I don't know if you can expect them to continue buying back shares. I don't know managements take on this. Could be a temporary increase because of rona or part of long term payout strategy. 

If anyone has information on this I would really love to hear it!"
04/05/2021,stocks,Oh shit. Did not realize Google owned Android
04/05/2021,stocks,"Good points. I hadn't been following their acquisitions that closely and didn't realize how modest they have been. 

I didn't really mean to say that not using leverage is a good thing, but that if that accounts for a lot of the P/E then I'm not too worried about the earnings: the core business is very profitable. Having a cash pile that's not being put to use is a lot better than having a lot of resources tied up in things that aren't making much money, and easier to fix. Or I guess that's the bullish way of looking at it. 

I have no idea if the executives have ever addressed this or talked about why it is. But it jumps out pretty quickly in even pretty simple accounting comparisons to other companies, so they're obviously aware of it. But you'd think they'd put some more cash into venture capital or something just to get some sort of return, spending a lot on internal R&D is great but not something you expect to scale up really quickly."

They had about 4 to 5 more deals this year with another Chinese ev, Hyundai, strengthend their deal with Amazon, and a Scandinavian company. But their er flopped and now I'm starting to think was this a horrible mistake.

I don’t know when you bought in/ avg cost, but that is something that everyone should have considered when buying/ investing into a company. People who blindly bought in are going to be in for a rough ride.

It’s also entirely possible that there’s a meme rebound that offers a selling opportunity or a better earnings report later this year that drives price up. But what do I know? I was predicting a floor at 11 as of weeks ago."

04/05/2021,stocks,"Their revenue for this quarter was impacted because of ongoing negotiations. Investing in BB is also a long play, maybe 1-2 years. We arent buying into this company for what it currently is, but the potential it has in a year or so. The recent er is completely irrelevant."

That is the huge if though. and nothing that will be answered this year."

04/05/2021,stocks,"Even the ding dongs over at WSB will tell you this is a long play. BB has some of the best potential for growth out there, but it's gonna take time. If your thesis hasn't changed, then you shouldn't be considering selling."

I doubt that BB will rise again like good old days but you never know. I don't look into BB because there are other good stocks that has lot of growth potential.

You're probably comparing android auto with QNX CAR Platform for Infotainment, which is also an infotainment OS. This, however, always was a low priority system for BB. BB actually is actively pushing car manufacturers to use QNX (as embedded OS) + android auto (as infotainment OS) since they're integrating it through QNX Hypervisor: https://blogs.blackberry.com/en/2021/02/blackberry-qnx-working-with-android-open-source-project-to-drive-advancements-in-connected-and-autonomous-vehicle-technology"

04/05/2021,stocks,"Warrants are great. They give you the opportunity to buy shares of great companies for far lower cost. A few things to consider:

Most warrants have a 5 or so year duration before expiration and have a strike price of $11.50. This strike price is only if you want to redeem the warrants for common stock. Redeeming for common stock is great if you are in for the long haul. 

On the other hand, you can trade warrants as warrants. No strike price, nothing. This gives people the ability to trade some great companies they wouldn't normally be able to afford. Don't let people trick you telling you that you can make money off warrants unless you redeem them - its just not true. 

You can still make plenty of money before the warrant expires without redeeming them for commons. 

In your case, make sure the warrants are 1/1 with commons and fking send it."

Also, for every charger you stop at you will have to a. Have an account with the charging company and b. Go into the app and activate the charging c. Pray it works because there are tons of QC issues with them. 

VS you buy a tesla and you will wait is 15- 30 minutes and all you do is plug in and walk away. Every single time. No registration. No credit cards.

Level 3s less ubiquitous but they’re mostly only in shopping centers/gas stations.

Lots of cities/utility companies have rebates for home charging as well.  Most users charge at home so I don’t really see the issue with the “overnight” range to charge on a standard outlet.  Level 2s charge many EVs in a few hours, not just Teslas, no?  

My sources are pretty much my neighbor’s older BMW EV, everyone’s Tesla and the Nissan Leaf.

VW existing EVs can handle all levels of charging"

If you need to travel with the EV and arent staying overnight at your charging station than you are pretty much SOL. Level 2 is just unacceptable for many common scenarios that people are used to with ICE vehicles and is a complete regression. 

Tesla superchargers are all level 3. Its a completely different situation and does not significantly affect your traveling or weekly in town fill up like all the rest do. 

TLDR; Level 2 charging is too slow in many common situations except for at home. Tesla's don't have this problem since their superchargers are Level 3."
2021-04-05 05:08:56,stocks,"Microsoft wins U.S. Army contract for augmented reality headsets, worth up to $21.9 billion over 10 years The U.S. Army said Wednesday that Microsoft has won a contract to build more than custom HoloLens augmented reality headsets. The contract for over 120,000 headsets could be worth up to $21.88 billion over 10 years, a Microsoft spokesperson told CNBC.

The deal shows Microsoft can generate meaningful revenue from a futuristic product resulting from years of research, beyond core areas such as operating systems and productivity software.

It follows a $480 million contract Microsoft received to give the Army prototypes of the Integrated Visual Augmented System, or IVAS, in 2018. The new deal will involve providing production versions.

The standard-issue HoloLens, which costs $3,500, enables people to see holograms overlaid over their actual environments and interact using hand and voice gestures. An IVAS prototype that a CNBC reporter tried out in 2019 displayed a map and a compass and had thermal imaging to reveal people in the dark. The system could also show the aim for a weapon.

""The IVAS headset, based on HoloLens and augmented by Microsoft Azure cloud services, delivers a platform that will keep soldiers safer and make them more effective,"" Alex Kipman, a technical fellow at Microsoft and the person who introduced the HoloLens in 2015, wrote in a blog post. ""The program delivers enhanced situational awareness, enabling information sharing and decision-making in a variety of scenarios.""

The headset enables soldiers to fight, rehearse and train in one system, the Army said in a statement. The contract, which was awarded on Friday, has a five-year base period, with a five-year option after that, an Army spokesperson told CNBC an email. The Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The deal makes Microsoft a more prominent technology supplier to the U.S. military. In 2019, Microsoft secured a contract to provide cloud services to the Defense Department, beating out Amazon, the leader of the public-cloud market. Amazon has been challenging the contract, which could be worth up to $10 billion, in federal court.

This is number ONE on that list."
04/05/2021,stocks,"From what I understand one of the big winners of this deal is a relatively small company called Microvision, who make some of the key components of the headset. They went from being a penny stock to being worth $15 a piece, and there’s evidence this is a floor rather than a ceiling. Turns out they’ve been working on futuristic tech for years and amongst their designs they have some useful components for self-driving cars.

I’d say worth a small play at least. I’m queued up to open a position"
04/05/2021,stocks,I can't understand why there is no money in the US for universal healthcare.

Great post! Do you know if the global chip shortage is affecting Microsoft though? I know they’ve used chips from Qualcomm and intel but are moving away from Intel and are designing some with AMD rn. However Qualcomm and AMD have both have short-medium supply constraints and intel don’t have the tech needed to make industry leading chips atm and it’ll probably be more than a year before their new investment in chip manufacturing capacity comes online. Given all this, can Microsoft even produce more chips atm?"

What about the other 99.9%? Enough of the memes about free healthcare like it’s so cheap to the taxpayers. Do your research and know how much stuff truly costs and where it goes. Fun fact, for every dollar spent on the military, 2.5 dollars goes to some form of welfare already."

reason: AR provides the ability to inject software/code into ones real life which offers a significant more capability than standard VR while ALSO allowing the ability for straight VR by creating a complete, opaque overlay across a users area of view.

&#x200B;

I also believe we're more like 20-40 years away before AR/VR is well developed and integrated into standard life as TV's, PC's and cell phones are today. We're currently in the AR/VR equivalent of the birth of TV. It's available, but has very little use as the tech is still too new and under developed.

04/05/2021,stocks,Their Leading edge technology that is better than any other competitor’s product is what makes the Hololense possible.

04/05/2021,stocks,"Yeah scrubbing buoys, running fire drills, and sitting in an air conditioned office doing clerical work is totally assisting in the killing of people on behalf of the government. Like really man you sound so uneducated, do you really think all of our military is just full of indoctrinated killers? Because it’s not, it’s regular folk like anybody else in our society. People who specifically do jobs making ID cards, or filling out requisitions for food supplies, travel reimbursements. A very small percentage of our military will ever see violence, let alone condone it. These regular people are joining not because of some nationalist propaganda, but because they want free health care, a stable paycheck, and free college tuition."
04/05/2021,stocks,"I had friends get doctors to lie about their asthma to join the army. I had friends get their congressman to maybe let the navy look the other way on some medical history.

And the army doctors diagnosed one friend’s chronic health problems which had put him in the hospital many times."

04/05/2021,stocks,Because Crimea is definitely the same as Canada. You need to be severely paranoid to think that Russia would invade Canada.
04/05/2021,stocks,Check the demographics of Crimea and it made sense for it to be part of Russia.

04/05/2021,stocks,"The reason Russia won't encroach into Canada is because the US spends 3.4% of its GDP on the military, not because of anything Canada does."

NO! I don’t WANT zoo support KILLERS

04/05/2021,stocks,Idk I served and was stationed on an icebreaker that went to Antarctica to support the NSF and their scientific missions. How did my service support any injustice? The only injustice is how much they paid me for having absolutely no skills and being a total idiot kid. I’m now hooked the fuck up with benefits for the rest of my life. 0/10 sucked ass but I’d do it all over again if I had to.
04/05/2021,stocks,"Definitely. 

The friend didn’t need an army doctor, he needed a healthcare system that was determined to make him healthy, not just treat his symptoms and send him back out to get sick again.

It’s a shame that for many people that’s the only way they can access it."
04/05/2021,stocks,"Exactly my point, the name of the countries surrounding the US are irrelevant here."
04/05/2021,stocks,"I mean, if a single country had a superior military with no competition, we would all be ruled by it. This isn’t exclusive to Russia.

For Russia, that is IF they had a superior military to go through USA controlled waters and bully a neighbouring country to the US. That’s not happening any time in this century."

04/05/2021,stocks,"Like I said, it's fucked up that you have join the military to improve your life.

Why can't the government just guarantee jobs that actually build up America instead of guaranteeing military jobs?"

04/05/2021,stocks,"They do, it’s called state and federal jobs. Most just don’t want to work for the government lmao.

I think I’m way better off than most people on Reddit. I don’t need to get in debt via student loans or nothing. If you look at my posts, you can see what I wasted my money on, if I didn’t I’d prob would’ve have cleared 200k."
04/05/2021,stocks,"No lol being ignorant would be continuing to have this conversation with you, it’s just not constructive. You live your life and I’ll just continue living mine, I don’t have time in my life to argue with people on the internet."
04/05/2021,stocks,"It's not that easy to get a state and federal job. Lots of people want that job over joining the military. But you're obviously in love with the military so you wouldn't admit to that fact.

Not sure about that bro. 100k over 3 years ain't that great. Especially if you gotta work your ass off in the military for it."

That's ignorance."

Now they’re paying me 3200 every month for 3 years to go to school so when I graduate with my masters I’ll get hired before most civilians because they give military vets preference lol. I worked so hard delivering medical supplies in a hospital for 6 years. They got me."

Now the 200 shares on margin were purchased after the initial 1000 shares. So I guess I can choose to close out 200 shares as last in first out.. that would work right?

I would imagine the tax would be the same as in looking to fully close out this position in 1 to 2 months anyways, so its a short term gain regardless no matter how I close out."
04/05/2021,stocks,Sell 200 shares?
04/05/2021,stocks,[deleted]
04/05/2021,stocks,"Just sell enough to match the size of the margin debt. Any cash added to your account cancels debt, including cash from share sales.

Note: if the price has changed since you took on the debt, it will probably not be 200 shares."
04/05/2021,stocks,"Can you sell shares via SpecID in your brokerage? This let's you sell only the shares you specifically choose.

I have no idea if that'll sell the margin shares but just FYI."
04/05/2021,stocks,"Find out how much margin you are using in $. Divide that amount by the current share price and then sell that many shares. Done. 

If you have concerns about taxes, you have 3 days to determine which shares are sold. Example you can sell the first shares (uses FIFO) or you can sell the last shares you bought (LIFO - last in first out). If it’s something else just call your broker and see what you can do. But you only have 3 days before the sale settles so you need to do it quickly."
04/05/2021,stocks,Wouldn't selling OTM covered calls get you out of margin and allow you to keep your securities?
04/05/2021,stocks,"That should work, change to LIFO but don’t forget to change it back!"
04/05/2021,stocks,"I just have never dealt with margin, and am up.. so I wish to close it. I believe the stock has more room to run in the month, so I don't want to sell my cash bought portion of it just yet."
04/05/2021,stocks,This is neat. I didn’t know you could do this.
04/05/2021,stocks,"I've been in a similar position on webull and for whatever reason they don't allow selling options on margin (even if it's covered by shares), not sure what it's like on other platforms"
04/05/2021,stocks,[deleted]
04/05/2021,stocks,"Yup, is pretty handy too for selling only shares that have a Long holding period to take advantage of the lower-taxed Long Term Gains for example."
04/05/2021,stocks,"The stock is currently at about $35, I bought the cash portion of the shares a lil over $36 a share and the margin shares at $32 a share. So I don't want to sell the shares I have at $36. An when I sell on Ameritrade it sells the first purchased shares first. Considering the margin shares were bought last.. if I want to just close out those $32 shares, I assume I can sell as LIFO... Last in first out?"
04/05/2021,stocks,I can definitely see how this can be very beneficial.

04/05/2021,stocks,"TSM is a menace, but has geopolitical issues that may hurt its' position over the long term. I really like the company and their execution is top-notch, but, if you invest for the coming decade, stability is a factor you should take into consideration. Intel is absurdly cheap for a semiconductor stock but is a terrible company that has severely dropped the ball with regards to their leadership position. I like AMD as it has steadily grown its' market share in the all-important pre-built, server & notebook space. Nvidia has mostly a monopoly in high-end computing cards but is shady and, just like intel, engages in anti-consumer practices.

My personal bets would be AMD > TSM > Nvidia. I really would not bother with Intel. Also consider checking out Supermicro, which engages in the datacenter space."

My idea would be to wait a bit (FOMO is killing me) to see if MU breaks the 95USD barrier and if so it will very likely breakout and go to the moon. I also want to see what happens with AMAT since its in its ATH and tends to have some days of sideways movement, hopefully I can get it a little cheaper. Although price forecast is better for MU, I tend to invest in AMAT since they invest in solar and AI and to me that has a lot of potential in the future. Thoughts?"

It’s up 22% since I bought into it a week or so ago. It’s super volatile though and I know there are going to be some terrible -10% days from time to time, but this is more of a longer term hold so I’m not worried. And yes, leveraged ETFs are meant to be short term, but SOXL might be the exception."

OP look up TSM in the search function. Someone did some great DD a couple weeks ago on it."

04/05/2021,stocks,"I really believe in TSM. I received a job offer from a community specific recruiting firm, they're hiring quite a few skilled professionals. I was mildly impressed with their unique accommodations and training opportunitues, and decided I believe whole-heartedly in their business plan for the next few years.
I'm going to be placing a large ammount of my expendable income on TSM, without any worries about likely short term losses due to stock market volatility. Once their US facility comes online,  they will literally be top dog in a very important field... I feel very fortunate to have become aware of them as early as I have.

On one hand, I want the market to tank, and less people to know about them, so that I can buy up more. On the other, well... this is going to be on the mainstream news one day, regardless. It will be a household name."
04/05/2021,stocks,"Ha, this got me to laugh out loud. Agree here. Worked in the semi manufacturing space, I don’t think people on here understand how far TSMC is ahead of Intel. They’re going to have pricing power for years and their CapEx is staggering. I think the only thing that stops them is Moore’s Law hitting its quantum limit."
04/05/2021,stocks,"If you like AMAT, pick up LRCX. Those two have nearly half of the market between them."
04/05/2021,stocks,"Intel just had a new CEO,  what’s wrong with Gelsinger?  He is a self made guy who work for Intel over 3 decades and putting himself to school while working getting his graduate degree at Stanford.  His technical pedigree is unquestionable as he is a chip architect and his tenure was successful as CEO at VMware where he tripled their value in his helm?"
04/05/2021,stocks,"But isn't TSM the main supplier for AMD? Not that it's relevant, I just feel that everyone who is computer savvy has already heard about AMD, while TSM is only just hiring in the US."
04/05/2021,stocks,Add in AMAT and LRCX and you've got a great manufacturer-agnostic trio.
04/05/2021,stocks,Every portfolio that has AMAT should also have LRCX in my opinion
04/05/2021,stocks,SMH holds both MU and AMAT
04/05/2021,stocks,"Nicely done on buying the dip -- I bought it roughly sometime pre-split meaning my per-share was in the low 40s. Shouldn't matter though, I don't see the semiconductor industry or the SOX index contracting significantly in the next handful of years"
04/05/2021,stocks,This is your chance
04/05/2021,stocks,They are already a household name. The financial times said not long ago how popular semi conductors were. It said to watch out for intel too.
04/05/2021,stocks,"There's nothing particularly wrong with the CEO but Intel as a company has severely drifted from its' intended course. They had no meaningful competition from AMD since their AMD Phenom days and they absolutely blew it in every way imaginable. They've lost consumer goodwill (AMD is now the saving grace of the performance desktop market), lost Apple as a customer and their business partners are choosing AMD more and more for their outstanding value. 

Add to that their chip production issues which also aren't solved overnight, my only question remains: why would I buy this near its' all-time high? Their 11th gen desktop launch has been disastrous (Gamersnexus called it 'pathetic', HW Unboxed labeled it shit) and AMD just keeps knocking it out of the park with their high-efficiency, high-core count SKU's. Sure it trades at a premium but that is also reflected in their future earnings and profitability. I really would not bother with team blue. For shits and giggles, check out Linus's video titles on youtube for both AMD and Intel. The amount of goodwill that they have lost over the years to AMD is laughable. AMD was dead in the water and the only reason they found a log to hold on to is that Intel allowed them to."
04/05/2021,stocks,"Intel needs to add a rule to their company bylaws that they’re not going to let anyone from finance, sales, or marketing run the company ever again. You’d think they’d of learned after Otellini but nope, they didn’t.

Gelsinger is the single best pick out there. It is not even close. Will he right the ship? That’s a bigger and more difficult question."
04/05/2021,stocks,But tsm has a way bigger market cap. Doesn't that mean more people hold them and that more people know about them?
04/05/2021,stocks,"Are the two companies complementary, or competitors?"
04/05/2021,stocks,"Their ATH does not really give them justice because their PE is 13, way below semiconductor averaged which is 35-40.  They are way undervalued.  Intel is still a leader in semiconductor market and has been awhile now around 15% of market share.  They still generate 8x more times revenue and 21.5 more times profitable than AMD even with the chip flopped.  Now they have invested 20 billion on chip manufacturing with US government backing.  Chip shortage is very critical to US economic competitiveness and national security and our government will definitely do everything in their power to get that done.  Payout is bigger and that is why I trim my position on TSM and AMD and go balls deep with Intel."
04/05/2021,stocks,"Competitors, but they have nearly half the market between them. And I’ve read that many chip manufacturers use multiple machine suppliers so as not be too dependent on one. So any news of factory openings/expansions generally lifts both stocks."
04/05/2021,stocks,"You are correct, they are very cheap and chips as a whole have a bright future. But I do not think they are in a strong position to capitalize on the sector as their competitive edge has severely eroded. I understand that it's unlikely to go much lower but I just don't see Intel as an unrivaled proposition. That said, I hope I'm wrong and you will receive a handsome reward :). Competition in this space always benefits the consumer."
04/05/2021,stocks,I appreciate the summary.
04/05/2021,stocks,"The fact that Intel is down with the chip flopped, yet they are still racking profits and near ATH, that’s a very good reason for me to roll with them.  Anyone backed by our government is in strong position.  

Like Buffet said, Never bet against America."
04/05/2021,stocks,"TSM is ""coming to America"", I speculate like most good immigrants, to get away from commies. So they'll be ""Taiwanese American"" shortly, lol."
2021-04-05 04:19:16,stocks,"Dell Exploring Chip Manufacturers Other than Intel for Servers >Dell Technologies CEO Michael Dell said although Intel has been “a great partner” with his company over the decades, the $94 billion server and PC giant will use the most innovative processors inside its solutions moving forward.

>“As the No.1 provider of servers in the world, you can be sure we’re taking advantage of all the latest ingredients that allow us to provide the best solution out there,” said Dell in an interview with CRN. “[Intel CEO] Pat Gelsinger is a great friend and the Ice Lake generation of microprocessors from Intel offer remarkable improvements across all the performance characteristics that are super important. Having said that, there are other microprocessors out there.”

This is some very important commentary. Dell has historically produced a few, more niche, AMD-powered bare-metal and edge options, with Intel as the default chip manufacturer/architecture for their broader server offerings. It sounds like they may be reconsidering that which would be an absolutely monstrous blow to Intel as their consumer chip business is already eroding significantly.

04/05/2021,stocks,Big uh oh for intel.
04/05/2021,stocks,"Totally inevitable since Intel parts are super power hungry and underperform.  Total cost of ownership is abysmal with current parts, and that seems like it will be the case for some time."

04/05/2021,stocks,AMD LESSSGOOOOO
04/05/2021,stocks,"Intel has so much money, will come out on top eventually.  Might flatline like Microsoft did for years, but they'll be back."
04/05/2021,stocks,"Didn't AMD just release processors for Data centers with the Milan series, shits looking up for them rn and I'm a shareholder lets gooo"
04/05/2021,stocks,"Meanwhile, AMD will grab more market share in 2021 with Zen 3, 7nm EPYC, and there is nothing standing in the way of AMD grabbing still more market share in 2022 and 2023 with 5nm EPYC"
04/05/2021,stocks,inb4 AMD
04/05/2021,stocks,I think he's talking about ARM products.
04/05/2021,stocks,"I would hesitate to think that Intel's consumer base is ""eroding significantly,"" as implied here. It has for the past 3 years logged persistently strong earnings albeit with minimal *growth*. It boasts financial stability and a more or less healthy balance sheet. It has paid a dividend for a long time and continues to do so. It is viewed by the speculative eyes pessimistically against its oft-mentioned chip competitors, AMD, NVDA, etc., which probably explains its very low valuation multiples against most of these such competitors. Still, despite this, this excerpt here doesn't preclude Intel as a future/ongoing account payable for Dell. It merely suggests that Dell will keep their options open going forward, as they well should. 

Sidenote: In a glancing view of AMD, I will mention that I noticed that if you look in certain places (like Yahoo finance) it would appear that AMD's earnings skyrocketed in Q4 2020. In the income statement, this appears due to a **$1.2 billion** negative tax provision, which they tacked onto earnings for the quarter. I haven't yet confirmed where this huge tax break comes from, but I would hazard the guess that this is a manifestation not of actual growth but of accounting wizardry."
04/05/2021,stocks,"Anyone here still remember back in the mid 2000s Dell was flirting with using AMD during the Athlon days? They never really did, everyone suspected the public ""rumors"" were just a bargaining play to get better prices from Intel.

We see if history repeats itself."

04/05/2021,stocks,I guess they dont trust intel anymore
04/05/2021,stocks,"Indeed. It seems to me that Intel's strategy with their new US-based foundries is to bet on protectionist legislation to support domestic chip manufacturing. That seems like a huge gamble in the long-term that, even if it pans out, would result in a business model highly vulnerable to political headwinds. 

If this strategy doesn't pan out, we could see a massive shift in the industry."
04/05/2021,stocks,Guh.
04/05/2021,stocks,Almost everything will likely be positive at open tomorrow due to jobs. Maybe a chance to get out.
04/05/2021,stocks,"I'm not so sure SecretUsername2000, a big ol pile of cash is obviously an enormous advantage but CPU architectures are not developed overnight and they have severely eroded the trust of both consumers and their business partners. They chose to release quad cores for 10 years straight and sit on their laurels collecting cash during the absence of any meaningful competition. Good for your shareholders but AMD has taken all of the air out of the room with their outstandig products."
04/05/2021,stocks,"Well problem for Intel and also AMD is also that ARM and soon maybe RISC-V are a real threat against x86 CPU's.

In a time where they need to invest in R&D heavily to keep their lead they suddenly get less and less money. It could also be the beginning of an eternal downward trend. 

The next 1 or 2 years will decide that."
04/05/2021,stocks,"They also have enormous debt.  
It looks safe because their profits have been steady (though not increasing lately), and they have been grossly under-investing in their future business relative to TSMC (looks great for short term profits), but if profits decline, even if they cut stock buybacks (or perhaps even dividends in the worst case), things will not looks nearly so nice.  

It seems like a solid steady safe stock, but if you look closely, one can also paint a story where it is just a stagnating mess."
04/05/2021,stocks,The way they invest that money will determine whether or not your hypothesis is true. Microsoft could have just as easily faded like so many other companies.
04/05/2021,stocks,Microsoft came back around by admitting they missed the boat on some markets and doubling down on new revenue streams in growing markets. Not by trying to claw the established market from the iPhone.
04/05/2021,stocks,"Lol ice lake is finally shipping, that's going to stand in their way for sure /s."
04/05/2021,stocks,"FYI, ""consumer chip business"" refers to sales of chips for consumer electronics which have, in fact, eroded significantly over recent years in terms of market share. The most obvious example being Apple moving to ARM chips in their laptops. That's relevant because this article refers to the other portion of Intel's business, where they are currently much more dominant -- enterprise server chips. If their market share starts to degrade in that space as well, Intel will be in very real trouble."
04/05/2021,stocks,Bingo
04/05/2021,stocks,"It will work though. America is a protectionist nation. Example: Boeing/Lockheed, oil/gas even coal"
04/05/2021,stocks,"Nah, I’m still going bullish on Intel. I’m actually heavily invested in index funds and cannabis ETF’s, Intel is one of my few individual stocks, mostly because I’m a fanboy. I still think they can make a come back, even if they slump for a while. Who knows, they might be all over that GaN refinement at their new foundries and then explode in 2025."
04/05/2021,stocks,They don’t have the lead... AMD tech has surpassed Intel.
04/05/2021,stocks,"One or two years? Fuck that, try one or two decades. Until the software stack changes in any meaningful way, it's x86 for the foreseeable future. Maybe for generalized workloads you may see cloud vendors picking custom arm or risc v CPUs, I'd imagine that with nvidia's pending purchase of arm, you're going to see a lot of vendors start pushing more on risc v and moving away from arm. Nvidia buying arm is sort of like a death kiss."
04/05/2021,stocks,"True, but both companies are so big and core to their ecosystem that their future cash flows/balance sheet will provide them endless opportunities to re-engage.  If I was a top chip designer/manufacturing expert and was offered stock options at these levels, Intel looks like the most compelling opportunity today.

Not long any semis at the moment."
04/05/2021,stocks,"That's a big and loaded **if** at the end, there. By the letter, Intel's chip inclusion in sold computers has fallen while AMD's inclusion has increased. That is true. However, for that trend to continue, Intel will have to continue to sit on its hands while its competitors pick up more steam. Possible, but it's equally imaginable that instead of sitting on its hands, Intel puts its superior financial footing and staying power to use totry competing with rising competition, as one should expect any company worth its salt to do.

Bottom line is that from **hard numbers related to their finances**, Intel's outlook is buttressed by financial stability, relative undervaluation, and persistent earnings. Its competitors have the potential to grow into the next juggernaut, but it's inherently speculative and largely based on hope and promise---not numbers."
04/05/2021,stocks,"Yes, the FTC remembers that ""flirting"" too.  Geslinger was at Intel during their darkest and most corrupt days.  If he decides to flirt, as you call it, or illegally coerce as the FTC calls it hopefully the FTC won't sit on their hands and punish Intel years after the damage is done this time."
04/05/2021,stocks,TSMC and the Korean conglomerates also come to mind. America is protectionist but they are not alone in that respect.
04/05/2021,stocks,They still have the market lead hands down.
04/05/2021,stocks,"Fair enough. I think it's important to recognize though that Intel's departure from exclusively owning both design & manufacturing is a partial acknowledgement of defeat. They're shifting to manufacturing of both their own architecture and others because their designs are being beat by ARM. If eventually they become only a manufacturer, their competition is TSMC, not AMD. That's really critical, as their margins will be determined by the role they play in the production roadmap. 

Personally, my position is that Intel will be around for decades either way. That doesn't mean their valuation couldn't drop by 50% over the next decade though. Shifting to a lower margin business model, essentially becoming a hardware supplier, is not ideal and could very easily result in far lower multiples."
04/05/2021,stocks,"I mean, this article is about the largest server manufacturer in the world literally saying, ""Intel has been a great partner, but..."" 

Regarding your ""hard numbers"" comment, Intel shrank YoY in both revenue and income in Q4 while all of their major competitors saw double-digit growth.

*If* the current trend continues, Intel is in trouble. Maybe they'll buck that trend, but *the article in question* indicates that trend may be accelerating.

In the context of this thread, I couldn't care less who takes their market share. The topic is Intel."
04/05/2021,stocks,"Yeah the market, and we know the market is irrational... AMD products have been slashing Intel what do they have to show for it on the Intel side? A new CPU that can’t beat amd’s top of the line, this applies to server grade processors and retail. Yeah Intel may lead “stock wise” but if you understand the market place and do your research... Intel is stagnating, they announcement of new in house fabs doesn’t really do much when you don’t have a product that can beat competitors especially in the tech world. I’m not trying to shill Intel, but I just think it needs to be brought to attention that AMD has been making moves"
04/05/2021,stocks,"I don't necessarily agree that they've acknowledged defeat, or what that even means.  They are building new factories in the US.   Being Ford when others are BMW doesn't mean you don't both make money."
04/05/2021,stocks,"I mostly agree with what you're getting at, FTR. The fact that Dell is basically like ""eh we're shopping around"" **should** warrant Intel's attention. I felt compelled to put forth a counter instead of letting the thread be bombarded with concern posts."
04/05/2021,stocks,"AMD is winning technically, there is no doubt on this.

Intel has had such an incredibly dominant market share for so many years, it's very hard to overcome that. AMD is succeeding, but progress is gradual. They have to wait for all of their OEMs to relearn how they do business in order to buy from more than just one CPU provider. Not to mention the practical limitations of ramping production capacity."
04/05/2021,stocks,That metaphor would make sense if Ford started building cars for BMW alongside their own because their own designs were falling behind competitors and losing major customers as a result.
04/05/2021,stocks,"Fair enough. I'm not trying to suggest Intel is doomed. There is plenty of opportunity for them to turn this around. However, this development at Dell paints a much more concerning picture for their enterprise processor business which is their bread and butter at this point.

I don't disagree with you that it's a pretty *big if*, if Dell will switch to another architecture as their primary, but the fact it appears to even be in question is very worrisome for Intel. A shift like that could spark a very fast, very brutal decline for INTC"
04/05/2021,stocks,"Yeah I understand, I’m sure we’ll see AMD chip at that market share more and more as Intel has been complacent. Lisa Su isn’t about smoke and mirrors, she only knows results and she delivers. I’m biased towards amd as a consumer and an investor. I like the whole semi market as a whole and Intel switching to their own fabrication is huge for AMD’s priority at TSMC. I just really struggle to see the pull towards Intel, is everyone betting on their comeback? Do we really believe they can pull it off? The new CEO is a good step but is he really enough to change the stagnation we’ve been seeing?  I see a lot of uncertainty yes they’re financially sound as of now, but in terms of tech I’m all in on AMD. The xilinix Merger will open them up to keep pushing forward into intels market cap."

04/05/2021,stocks,"Overvalued atm and I am very skeptical with their core business.  I was wondering why they are treading water with their EBITDA with high revenue growth and it looks a lot of those revenues are from their Bitcoin transactions which they count as “revenues”,  bit deceiving but clever.

Bullish:

Read up their business model. It makes sense and it's somewhat vertical integrated. Their clearly doing more than most companies in the financial sector. Strong brand, visionary CEO, people like the product. Engineering wise this company is very good and has a distinct advantage over its competitors. Invested in crypto. 

Bearish:

As of right now crypto. This stock is tied to the success and adoption of crypto and if it tanks I would expect a major pull back.

04/05/2021,stocks,It's very hard to short companies like Square. They may look expensive but they can also keep going up at what a reasonable investor could consider an unreasonable level. Also Square is not a broken company and is growing fast so shorting would not be a good option for me..

2021-04-05 03:38:00,stocks,"Leaving Robinhood I am a brand new investor with $1k in Robinhood —a wide variety of stocks, many fractional shares. I want to move everything into Fidelity but it looks like there would be a $75 transfer fee. My question —  can/should I just sell everything in RH and then immediately buy the same amount in Fidelity (which also has fractional shares)? Wouldn’t that achieve the same result with costing me $75. Am I missing something?"
04/05/2021,stocks,You will pay tax on stocks that you sell. Make sure you don’t end up losing lot more more money trying to save $75
04/05/2021,stocks,Nah just start using Fidelity and don't open any more positions in RH. No need to pay money to transfer or liquidate everything.
04/05/2021,stocks,"The only real consideration is that you will be realizing all of the gains and losses in your portfolio when you sell in RH. This could mean the difference between paying higher taxes on short-term capital gains (for stocks held less than one year) compared to long-term capital gains (for stocks held longer than one year), for instance.

Most importantly, if you sell any stock at a loss, you can't repurchase it until the 31st day after the sale or else it's considered a wash sale, and the capital loss is disallowed. Selling at a gain and repurchasing immediately isn't a problem.

There's no need to sell everything at once. You could gradually sell positions in RH, wait for the trades to clear, then transfer the cash out and into your new Fidelity account. If you don't care about the tax implications, selling everything and transfer the cash all at once is certainly easier -- just postpone repurchasing any stocks that were sold at a loss until after 30 days."
04/05/2021,stocks,I’d recommend using Fidelity regardless of your Robinhood situation.  Just because you currently have Robinhood doesn’t mean that should stop you from using the platform of your choice
04/05/2021,stocks,"I b Eli eve RH will liquidate all fractional shares in an account transfer, meaning that you’ll get the money but they don’t transfer fractional shares. It might be that they can’t transfer them."
04/05/2021,stocks,"If I had to do it over again, I would liquidate RH and rebuy in the new broker. My tax situation may be different than yours. 

I transferred to my new broker. I am still waiting for my cost basis to show up at the new broker. I could manually calculate it myself and ask my new broker to update my account, but with fractional shares, multiple buy dates, and DRIP, it would be a headache.

The cost basis transfer issue from RH is a known problem. I have my doubts that they will ever send it."
04/05/2021,stocks,"If you’ve lost money, you won’t be taxed so you can liquidate and repurchase in Fidelity. Note though that funds can take 3 days to clear before you’re able to buy again. If I were you, I’d open the Fidelity account then call customer service and ask for their help — they might cover the fee but you won’t know unless you call!"
04/05/2021,stocks,"Fidelity will reimburse you the $75 transfer fee. But, I understand if you're trying to stick it to RH and not let them make $75 off of you. 

&#x200B;

As far as selling off to buy back, will you be selling at a loss? If so, I'd just do the xfer. But, keep in mind that some are saying it's taking a ridiculously long time to xfer."
04/05/2021,stocks,"If that $1000 started at $100, then you may have to worry about the tax implications of selling. If not, the taxes will probably be less than the transfer fee."
04/05/2021,stocks,Just drag the transition out and do it slowly. Wait until each stock reaches a peak high and then buy it back low in Fidelity. Transfer your money as you go. You may want to load some other money on Fidelity first and pull it out of Robinhood as you sell off.
04/05/2021,stocks,Call around because you might be able to take an extra step to get it reimbursed
04/05/2021,stocks,"Something to consider with a transfer: fractional shares don’t transfer.  They’re sold and transferred over as cash.  You may want to consider squaring up and getting a full share of what you hold, or if you’re good with potentially owning less than you do now, go ahead and transfer.  I didn’t see a few when I transferred, so you may want to check with Fidelity’s customer service."
04/05/2021,stocks,"Yeah I would keep the Robinhood account and start a new account with fidelity.  Makes no sense to close the account because what you will realize later on is their options trading, which is large, has the easiest UI."
04/05/2021,stocks,"If you transfer to Fidelity,  call them afterwards and they'll reimburse the $75 fee"
04/05/2021,stocks,I would just open a new account on Fidelity and sell my shares on RH in a dip and buy back on Fidelity. That way you are minimizing your profit (and therefore tax). Paying $75 when your account is worth $1000 doesn't make sense.
04/05/2021,stocks,"For just $1K invested, I would sell and rebuy. There is no rush so move when you have two spare weeks. You can even do it slowly, little by little, if you want to."
04/05/2021,stocks,I've heard it's better to sell and move money to your bank account v. another broker because RH will screw you over.
04/05/2021,stocks,"F fidelity.
Some of their customer service is crap and their UI sucks.

(I get it, people don't like my comment. I'm just still sore from my last interaction with them. If you all like them, I'm happy it's working out for you.)"
04/05/2021,stocks,"The only way ssues is you'll have to wait for the money to transfer.  So if you sell for a lose or gains, you may not have the cash in your fidelity account to buy at even, on the dip, but may get stuck buying high.  Bit yes it is basically the way to go.   I am waiting for the time to sell and will be transferring the cash as well."
04/05/2021,stocks,I’m right under the 30k for taxes in Cali so I’m vary cautious that I don’t go over endless it’s worth it which it hasn’t  been yet. Most of my stocks are long term retirement type stocks. Because with 3 kids I’m usually getting 10k every year for tax return and if I go over it’ll duck that up. I’m self employed so I’m able to make it that I earn just under the 30k ever year.
04/05/2021,stocks,Capital gains tax if the difference.  If you transfer its not considered a sale.
04/05/2021,stocks,"That's the cost of ""free trading""."
04/05/2021,stocks,"Which one is better Chase bank or Fidelity ? I’m planning to leave Robinhood and I checked with Chase and they told that if there’s any sell greater than 1M$ , than I have to first call them and it needs to be reviewed by them and after that only I’ll be able to sell, so that means I won’t be able to sell anything greater than 1 M  by Sell button."
04/05/2021,stocks,Fuck robinhood!
04/05/2021,stocks,He has $1000 in RH...also we dont know how much he profited. Probably best to sell and rebuy.
04/05/2021,stocks,Fidelity will take care of the $75. Sell your fractional shares and then transfer your account. It will take about 2 to 3 days. All stocks are down or at a loss right now so that’s not worth it. Wait it out in fidelity.
04/05/2021,stocks,"THIS^^^ OP if you don’t want to transfer make sure you understand what a wash sale is. 

I agree, there is no reason to immediately dump or jump ship, do it when it best suits your position. 

I think everyone should move out of RH but not at risk to your investments."
04/05/2021,stocks,"What’s so bad about a wash sale? Would you get taxed more? If so, he only has $1000 so I doubt the extra taxes would make a difference"
04/05/2021,stocks,I doubt that 1k sale is going to bump it into a higher tax bracket.
04/05/2021,stocks,Narrator: They can't.
04/05/2021,stocks,I have a cash account and get access to my money right away similar to RH. I’ve never used margin on either account.
04/05/2021,stocks,i don't have margin and my money is available instantly. think it depends on the bank.
04/05/2021,stocks,"You do have access to the money instantly, they just warn you about good faith violations."
04/05/2021,stocks,No they won’t - unless you’re transferring 25K in assets
04/05/2021,stocks,"It started at $1000 and, thanks to tech stocks, is a little less than that now 😢"
04/05/2021,stocks,Yeah I would say that with savings of $1000 that I'd just stay with RH. It's not worth the hassle.
04/05/2021,stocks,Call them *before* to see if they will.
04/05/2021,stocks,"It's okay to be upset, they got smacked pretty hard with all of those transfers and much like Vanguard, it's sometimes a pita to get someone.

That said, I think well of their ethics and you might want to look at active trader pro, which is their free desktop app and isn't half bad. I do wish the big fellas would step up their mobile game though. I hate to admit how much I liked the Robinhood UI."
04/05/2021,stocks,"Unless you’re low income , I don’t think you’re taxed"
04/05/2021,stocks,They will not actually. I just transfered in. Only if you have 25k plus will they cover the fee.
04/05/2021,stocks,"When you transferred to fidelity, were you still  the cost basis info? Like how the average share price and percent gain"
04/05/2021,stocks,"Yes, a wash sale will in effect increase your taxes (in a taxable account). Since a wash sale eliminates a capital loss, that loss can't be used to offset gains, so you'd be paying more in capital gains taxes than you would if the loss hadn't been wiped out.

It may be true that the extra taxes might not make a difference in OP's case, but minimizing the impact of taxes is an important concept in maximizing portfolio after-tax returns."
04/05/2021,stocks,In the case of selling and rebuying a full portfolio the WSR guarantees that all gains will be taxed since the losses are all deferred.
04/05/2021,stocks,"Are you positive? I just called the other day and was denied. I was told it was over 25k, and my portfolio is well over 2.5k."
04/05/2021,stocks,"Or if you generally have a sizeable account with them already. 

I transfered 80k into it a few months ago and had it all available immediately.  Don't have margin on my account."
04/05/2021,stocks,Oh. Interesting. I may have to look into that. Thanks for the heads up.
04/05/2021,stocks,You have that backwards
04/05/2021,stocks,Good to know. I didn’t realize that. I only saw the possible fee and never had to cover it. Now I know why.
04/05/2021,stocks,It’s 2.5k not 25k lmao
04/05/2021,stocks,Unfortunately none of that information transferred to Fidelity. It was my understanding that Robinhood didn’t actually own your shares and when you transfer they then go to market to buy them. Im most likely 100% incorrect in that thinking. However I don’t see average cost or any of that info from my transfer.
04/05/2021,stocks,"Yea but it’s only $1000, so the taxes shouldn’t be that much, right?"
04/05/2021,stocks,"im seeing people say 2,500 and 25,000 in here so if you want to make sure you should just call"
04/05/2021,stocks,Same
04/05/2021,stocks,25k for me
04/05/2021,stocks,"Nope they don't. Individuals making under 40k a year pay a 0% long term capital gains tax. It is corporate tax shenanigans that you are thinking of. That is where companies regularly avoid paying any taxes using foreign subsidiaries, accelerated depreciation, and other things."
04/05/2021,stocks,It was 25k in Feb. Was able to talk them down to 15k
04/05/2021,stocks,"this is wrong, I just called them days ago and was told it was 25k"
04/05/2021,stocks,Where can I find this info? Interested in moving to fidelity as well
04/05/2021,stocks,I transferred in February and can tell you from experience it was not $2.5k.
04/05/2021,stocks,It’s 25k bruh
04/05/2021,stocks,"We don't know.

He could be up big in one stock and down on the rest and still have 1k net in the acct. Rebuying would tax him on the gains and defer the losses."

I was going to transfer them into my margin account to leverage for extra BP but the process was not worth it and I would have lost my fractional shares, plus there were dividend tax implications and an overall loss of security imo.

2021-04-05 01:37:16,stocks,"I'd like to invest in electrocardiograms (manufacturers etc.) and am looking for some ideas I'd like to invest in companies for whom a large proportion of business revolves around EKG usage. Publicly traded companies I've looked into so far either:

1. Have too wide a range of products & services, or
2. Are medical device manufacturers who have already seen a Covid boom.

I think that the next big long-term wave in medicine is going to revolve around treating those with long term cardiovascular issues from Covid. I might be late to that party, but I'd like to at least be able to analyze what growth potential there may be."
04/05/2021,stocks,Hospitals are not making bank off covid and probably won’t off the lasting effects of it either. Most of the testing will be done in outpatient settings and doctors offices. Covid greatly reduced the number of elective procedures being done and even kept out people who really needed to be there because they were afraid of catching it. May get a bounce when and if covid is truly under control from all the people who have been putting off knee/hip replacements etc.  Many smaller hospitals where close to financial ruin prior to covid and will likely not survive without help from the government. Bigger corporations may swallow up their business when they close and benefit.  So it is a complicated play as far as hospitals are concerned is the point I guess I’m trying to make. 15 yrs working in hospitals...
04/05/2021,stocks,"I'm curious why this seems like a win to you; this seems like an overly-narrow focus on one area of health care. Where do you see the incoming money boom coming from? Equipment? Probably relatively minor additional investments; retail on a machine looks like ~$6k. Consumables like electrodes & gels? Probably a tiny overhead/profit margins on consumables. One AKG 12-lead test needs 12 electrodes, right? They sell for 20 cents each, according to google.  

Earlier in the pandemic I started going after testing & therapeutics companies like Abbott & saw some decent returns but honestly it was like playing whack-a-mole so I gave up (my Abbott: up 51% Gilead down 18%). In retrospect I wish I'd put heavy bets on things like UPS & Zoom instead. Hindsight is 20/20, eh?"

04/05/2021,stocks,"Frankly I’m a pretty unsophisticated investor and am just looking for ideas. I know EKG training courses are becoming more common among lower levels of the medical field.

I'm 24 and well employed so I have a fairly high risk tolerance and long time frame, but naturally I don't want to be making any obvious mistakes borne of inexperience.

How does the following look?

25% VUSA (VOO)

25% VHYL (not sure of the US equivalent)

30% ARKK (buying the positions directly rather than the ETF)

10% INRG (ICLN)

10% Individually chosen and mostly highly speculative stocks, none making up more than 2% of my total portfolio. Most likely chosen from the best of the SPACs I've been trading the last 6 months.

Thanks"
04/05/2021,stocks,"I started off buying VOO/ VTI every month and gradually began to spend more time reading about stocks. I've recently begun buying individual stocks as well. Depending on how much time you want to spend / your risk tolerance, consider investing a % in individual stocks for the higher upside. I would definitely start off small. For example, you might try buying 1800 in vti and 200 in a different stock each month, then compare your returns after a year."
04/05/2021,stocks,"I buy at least one share of VTI every month, regardless of price."
04/05/2021,stocks,OP you can do a split VTI and VXUS or you can grab a mutual fund that does both + bond market via [https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/VFFVX](https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/VFFVX) or VFFVX.
04/05/2021,stocks,Yes.
04/05/2021,stocks,Always VTI. VOO is good too. Depends on what you want to track. VTI is whole market and VOO is SP500 companies.
04/05/2021,stocks,"Regardless of current price, VTI is an excellent choice if you just want that money to grow slowly and steadily for decades until retirement with very little risk.

If you're looking to build a lot of wealth over a shorter period of 5-10 years, then your best option is to try and beat the market with high risk, high growth stocks. You could lose a lot of money that way, but if you want to make a lot of money in a short amount of time, it's the only way as VTI is far too diversified and stable."
04/05/2021,stocks,How does this work? I thought VTI tracked the market as a whole and VOO was SP500.
04/05/2021,stocks,"You meant QQQ, right?"
04/05/2021,stocks,At that point why not VT?
04/05/2021,stocks,"I enjoy VOO as my set and forget.  It’s paid for some other plays for me.  On a good run I might cash one out and buy a little adventure someplace else.  Of course that other pick hopefully plays well with VOO.

I like NVDA as my expensive tech ticker. 

Apple of course is a good long that plays nicely with VOO."
04/05/2021,stocks,VTI is about as diversified as it gets other than VT for total world.
04/05/2021,stocks,"My brokerage charges a fee per transaction. Cheapest that I can get.
  
Im sad that I cant do DCA."
04/05/2021,stocks,VOO is an SP500 based choice.  And sp500 is currently super tech heavy. Suppose that could adjust.
04/05/2021,stocks,I don’t know what QQQ expense ratio is but VOO is like 0.03? Hard to beat.
04/05/2021,stocks,"Vt is a great option.

I like having the individual etfs to be able to tailor my percentages."
04/05/2021,stocks," It is important to realize because Apple and Microsoft alone make up almost 10% of vti holdings. Add in FB, Google, Amazon and Tesla and those 6 tech companies alone are like 20% of it. The fund is like 40% tech because that is what the biggest companies tend to be right now. 

Real diversification means limiting exposure to any one company as well as limiting exposure to any one sector and also having exposure to different non correlated markets. That is how you limit non systemic risk.

Holding just VTI gives you zero exposure to the bond market. Practically zero exposure to commodity markets. Utilities, energy, materials, real estate, all these sectors comprise less than 11% of the fund total."
04/05/2021,stocks,"... like, are you serious?

You know there is more to the investment world than stocks? You know that VTI is weighted by market cap and not sector?

lol ok"
04/05/2021,stocks,Is it 1988 where you are? :)
04/05/2021,stocks,"My point was that VOO tracks the S&P500 whereas you were talking about tech, which is mainly listed at NASDAQ so therefore QQQ is the relevant ETF."
04/05/2021,stocks,"Europoor here our analysts have been predicting that the last 10 years, not holding my breath at this point."
04/05/2021,stocks,This
04/05/2021,stocks,"It's mirroring the stock market.  Historically there's always a handful of the Apples of the world that make up roughly a quarter of the market. This is nothing new. The fund is self cleansing in that any one company can go bankrupt - even Apple - and you'd only be down 5% at most. Systemic risk is a non issue.

Also, unless you're nearing retirement / drawdown there's little point in having bonds in a zero rate environment. If I had to guess OP is likely in their 20s or 30s, which means they're in an accumulation phase with 10+ years to ride out volatility."
04/05/2021,stocks,I dont get your joke.
04/05/2021,stocks,I could’ve explained better.  I wasn’t suggesting VOO was the heaviest tech ETF.  But it is heavier tech than VTI solely because of the current makeup of the sp500.
04/05/2021,stocks,"I Know right, only markets that have been performing quite well this year are the main indexes for the Netherlands and Germany."

04/05/2021,stocks,"OP asked about VTI and for 95% of retail investors it's the best choice for equities. It doesn't mean you can't look to diversify into international or other asset classes.

What I've learned over the years is to respond to your audience in a way that they understand and will be receptive to. Otherwise it defeats the purpose if they become disinterested with more complicated than necessary strategies to diversify any further for marginal long term gains. VTSAX/VTI is the Pareto principle in action. 

Also worth pointing out many of the same people looking for returns on taxable accounts also have retirement accounts, some of which have limited options and will have to choose between options. There's a comfort in seeing familiar funds and institutions, most cases being Vanguard mutual funds. 

My bottom line is I'm not trying to overcomplicate my answer for someone asking a simple question. If they asked about diversification with a tilt towards small cap exposure then we can go down the rabbit hole further."

Most probably the company will go through a prolonged stagnation like Microsoft did in the early 2000s when it faced similar antitrust challenges. Google won't be able to aquire competition like it did before and won't be able to leverage its strong positions as much as it used to.

Google Cloud is running way behind AWS and Azure and provides notoriously poor support. Companies today by default go to AWS, but because Amazon directly competes with so many companies, a lot of them choose Azure instead and get other Microsoft services as a bundle. Google Cloud is lagging behind and losing billions and billions trying to catch up.

Google's moonshots never paid off. Their ""X"" division lost billions and never materialized any products. Like Microsoft in the 90s and 2000s, Google invested into great ideas too early, wasted a lot of money and couldn't make viable products out of those investments. For example, Google has been investing into self-driving tech for 12 years now, no automaker is using their tech, and competitors are on the same tech level even though they started much later.

Many products that Google releases show signs of poor management, internal disorder and lack of vision. Google Stadia and Google Pay are perfect examples of that, as well as endless list of short lived chat apps.

Overall, in the past decade Google did not produce any new impactful products like it used to. All their cash cows are coming from the 00s. Google Search, Ads, Maps, Docs, Android, YouTube, Gmail, Chrome - are all from that time. The company scaled and improved them really well, but hence the antitrust issues.

Google is not very good at actually competing. It either has 80-90% market share or nothing. Everything in-between gets cancelled.

Most of the revenue growth comes from the internet itself growing and ads moving online, but that is slowing down and there's not much else Google is good at. And the good old monopoly positions are at risk of being crippled by regulators."

04/05/2021,stocks,"They will come back when they're older and more mature. Every youngster wants to focus on their pretty faces and maybe turn them into silly faces on Snap. But once you get older and develop wrinkles, and your young and taut skin becomes no so much so anymore, you quickly come back to Facebook so you can stay in the loop on who's dying and swap recipes with others."
04/05/2021,stocks,"By ""not going anywhere"" I think he meant they are solid companies that are here to stay."
04/05/2021,stocks,"No dude, like Kamala, he said it right"
04/05/2021,stocks,"I’m not arguing anything, I like their products, and I’ve gained by investing. 🤷"
04/05/2021,stocks,🙄
04/05/2021,stocks,Bruh i hate how people shit on google they are a literal conglomerate of tech. It’s like owning a mini etf in and of itself.
04/05/2021,stocks,Thank you.
04/05/2021,stocks,Yeah me too!
04/05/2021,stocks,[removed]
04/05/2021,stocks,"Yeah so.. people also gained from investing in Yahoo at some point, doesn't mean shit"
04/05/2021,stocks,Whoa whoa whoa. You sure you’re on the right sub? r/stocks doesn’t do this “valuation” stuff you speak of; we prefer to speak of story stocks.
04/05/2021,stocks,"This, facts"
04/05/2021,stocks,Because of the post is about FAANG stocks and thats the topic dum dum
04/05/2021,stocks,I don't have a problem with bears. People with contradictory viewpoints have actually talked me out of trades I would've lost money in before. Where I have a problem is when people start talking out of their ass like this guy did and provide *literally no justification* to their statements.
04/05/2021,stocks,Won't those same headwinds affect every single other app on Android and Apple?  So what are Apple and Google going to do when all the third party apps on their platforms go out of business because they're no longer making any revenue?  We all going back to flip phones?
04/05/2021,stocks,I agree with you
04/05/2021,stocks,It’s my money bro. Lol.
04/05/2021,stocks,Not anymore :D
2021-04-04 21:41:55,stocks,"How to invest in agricultural & Vertical Farming? Agricultural land is subsidized by the government here, so i am looking for USA based AG stocks, and global vertical farming tech. 

I see a massive market for Vertical Farming Tech, and institutions building these vertical farms.

Land is becoming scarce, population is growing and vertical farming saves a tremendous amount of fresh water. You can grown food year round, and they could potentially grow specialty foods that are not native to the area (expensive). 

Any thoughts on a long term strategy to capitalize on this?"
04/05/2021,stocks,"Here are the ones I know and like and the one I REALLY like because of its valuation, small float, recent earnings, and how established it is as a company while being new to the market:

APPH, AGFY, HYFM. And UGRO

All are fairly recent IPOs. They all seem worthwhile and I've owned them all at one point. SV with Aerofarms is another, it seems. But to me, the very under the radar and now best valued pick is the last one -- UGRO

It uplisted recently and got mentioned in some newsletter it seemed and had a ridiculous run. Now it's settled down. I've been accumulating simply based on the fundamentals and because it remains deeply undervalued despite having a sterling balance sheet now, great earnings, and expansion into Europe and more backlog than ever. Market cap of 69 million, with tiny float of 4.75 million (https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=UGRO -- all the PR and news is listed here, too). It's also notable that they don't seem to specialize (or even mention) cannabis and are focused on all manner of ""controlled environment agriculture"": https://urban-gro.com/ To my mind, this gives them more pick and shovels appeal as a ""pure play"" agriculture company, not a ""weed"" one with all the baggage and gyrations that carries.

""long_investor"" at ST (https://stocktwits.com/symbol/UGRO) has done amazing DD and here is a comment from him laying out the details:

""revenues grew 115% from 1st half of 2020 to 2nd half of 2020: From $8.2M to $17.6M (once Covid lockdown supply issues resolved). 

$9.2M reported today for Q4 alone is 30% growth over prior Q4. And most recent two qtrs UGRO turned EBITDA positive. 
$50M
 in cash still, as of yesterday 3/30/21. 

In Q1/2020, 
$UGRO
 had $4.3M in revs. Fast forward one year, entering Q1/2021, UGRO already had 
$14M
+ of signed contracts. What % growth will the next ER show over Q1/2020? And in Q2/2020, UGRO had 
$4M
 in revs. How about the YoY growth for this Q2’s ER? 

Depends on how many projects they completed. Though given they just reported $9.2M for Q4 revenues, odds seem good for our tiny micro-cap to show very significant growth compared to the $4.3M and 
$4M
 from Q1 and Q2 of 2020."""
04/05/2021,stocks,"Iron for farmers, John Deere $DE, case IH like $TITN, inputs like potash $PTAM, seed and chemical like $BFASF, $CTVA Corteva (Dow & DuPont) and Bayer $BAYRY.

If you’re looking into vertical farming, I’d check into LED light suppliers.  Sunlight might be free, but the variability in a greenhouse is crazy, too hot, too cold, not enough sunlight or too much.  Confined growth facilities are cool and consistent."
04/05/2021,stocks,Im in on GMEV. I got in a little higher but it fluctuates and i feel like it might grow soon
04/05/2021,stocks,As others have said App Harvest (APPH) & there's also a spac Spring Valley (SV) that's merging with Aero Farms
04/05/2021,stocks,SV just announced reverse merger of Aerofarms
04/05/2021,stocks,"Plenty of food can be grown on existing land; a lot of it is just fed to livestock, which also uses land. I see shifting dietary trends away from farm animals and towards plant based products being a threat to vertical farming. Right now we are just farming unsustainably which isn’t really a land issue but a distribution issue."
04/05/2021,stocks,Possibly GRWG?  It’s one of my marijuana picks but might fit your needs.
04/05/2021,stocks,BEE bee vector tech
04/05/2021,stocks,I'm personally in GMEV. It's more of a lottery ticket than an investment. Size appropriately. Foundation farms is pretty interesting.
04/05/2021,stocks,Thank you for the detailed reply!
04/05/2021,stocks,"Potash margins are about to take a hit for the next few years.  A lot of the new lithium supply from South American producers has potash in their brines at values that are economical to produce at these levels.  Once they spend the Capex to put it as a part of their extraction process, the floor gets even lower.

Phosphates or another mineral might be better plays.  Blenders will do ok, like refiners do during a down oil market.  Scott's Miracle Grow or Bunge might be better plays."
04/05/2021,stocks,"UGRO also does this, but is unlisted recently from OTC land (I believe) so it carries some more risk. 

Just had good earnings though..."
04/05/2021,stocks,I’m in on GMEV as well
04/05/2021,stocks,"You are right. You would not profit from technological advances through Farmland REITs immediately but in the mid and long term you would because you will still need land for such technologys. In my opinion Farmland looks quite attractive in the current makro condition (inflation, rising population,  kinda a light swift to deglobalization through corona) and Farmland REITs are at least now not at outlandish evaluation like some Tech companies."
04/05/2021,stocks,"Tyson, $TSN"
04/05/2021,stocks,Fair assessment but APPH has formed deep connections in KY and both local/state governments are committed to helping them expand. Their overhead and risk is much smaller in comparison as a result of the support they have garnered. APPH is even expanding into KY high schools through their FFA programs and helping them build out vert farming facilities.
2021-04-04 21:09:11,stocks,"Are stock trading courses mostly bullshit? Someone told me that stock trading courses are bullshit 95 % of the time, their reasoning being the following:

1. If the stock trader actually has a good strategies, they won't bother spending time on teaching other people.
2. Teaching other people their strategies is harmful to their business because ""it's pretty much just a war of different strategies"".

I don't quite see the logic here. First of all, the traders can have time to both trade stocks and teach courses. Surely with all the algorithms and with partners/assitants, they can make time to teach courses. Now, maybe the money they'd make from these courses would be such a drop in the bucket compared to their stock earnings, making it again pointless. I'm not sure about this, but a friend of mine is paying a quite sizeable sum for a trading course, and in this digital age, he could be one of many. So, perhaps there is a lot of money to make on this.

As for the second point: surely there are many instances where cooperation is most beneficial. As a teacher of a course, one has a lot of influence over the students, being able to perhaps tell them to invest in certain businesses that would benefit them all.

So, from my point of view, it doesn't make sense that being a teacher in a stock trading course means that one is most likely scamming the students. What do you guys think about this?"
04/05/2021,stocks,"For starters, it would be extremely advantageous for a trader to have people make similar trades as they do. As you and other purchase stock, it's price increases."
04/05/2021,stocks,Any course purporting to teach you how to do short term trading is bullshit because that sort of trading is bullshit.  It does not work over the long term (read that as many many trades) unless you have an edge.
04/05/2021,stocks,"Its bs, if the strategy worked that well, they would never need to sell it."
04/05/2021,stocks,Stock trading courses are 100% bullshit most of the time.
04/05/2021,stocks,"There is some truth to it, however you will most likely lose money, and you don't need to pay money for it there is so much free stuff online.
I've found most success using technical analysis with trades that land several weeks to years rather than day trading."
04/05/2021,stocks,"Im not saying these stock market gurus CANT trade, but selling YOU and thousands of other people a monthly subscription fee has 0 risk for them, and they can make exponentially more money with subs than trading.  

These penny stock guys use their platform to pump shares.  Having an army of people following your trades is incredibly lucrative and certainly helps you appear like you know what you're talking about.  

You absolutely CAN profit from following some of these trades, just keep in mind their buy and sell orders are filled before they enter them in chat.   They are artificially pumping demand on the buy side AND supply on the sell side and their trades benefit from this.    

There is a lot you can learn by being in the chats and following along, I just don't think its worth several thousand upfront and/or monthly paid subs."
04/05/2021,stocks,They are mostly coaching and stock psychology with a bit of TA and FA. If you can find a mentor you trust then go for it. But most of what they teach can be found on YouTube and webpages
04/05/2021,stocks,"I always say and maybe it's part of me not being a great student, and always preferring practical to theoretical knowledge, but especially if the course already costs something in the $500+ range, you're more likely to learn more from taking that $500 and doing investing, along with free resources, than having to sink $500 on a course, before you actually even make anything at all."
04/05/2021,stocks,"InTheMoney is pretty good too if you want to trade options, probably one of the best finance YouTubers out there"
04/05/2021,stocks,That's what I thought as well.
04/05/2021,stocks,That's exactly what I did 11 days ago and it's incredible how much I've learned. Put a little skin in the game and you'll be at full attention.
04/05/2021,stocks,"This is 100% right. No amount of reading will prepare you fully for the markets. The best teacher is to just jump into the ring with a small amount of money and play the market, all the while reading all you can. As your confidence grows, you can add more money to your account to play with. Just start trading is the best advice. In a year, you can get a pretty good handle on things, but there will still always be plenty more to learn with experience."
04/05/2021,stocks,"They're allowed to make money, just not by selling *us* stuff, for insane prices."
04/05/2021,stocks,"Are you the product or the consumer? 

Thanks."
2021-04-04 21:07:13,stocks,"Help find DCF website I'm looking for a website I saw on reddit 2 days ago that I can't find for the life of me.  It was a lot like [TrackTak](https://tracktak.com).  You could search for a stock by ticker and it would load information about it.  You would enter the assumptions and it would give you a intrinsic stock price at the top.  I believe it was black and green and just wanted to try it out, but again I haven't been able to find it.  Any help would be appreciated!"

04/05/2021,stocks,I have been looking at CRDF also. Going to jump in tomorrow.
2021-04-04 20:35:04,stocks,Moving stocks question I have almost 2.5k shares of a stock using Robinhood. Because RH lacks phone support I am looking to move to maybe TD Ameritrade for another broker. My question is what’s the process like to actually move the stocks you own to another platform? Anyone done this? And what wild you all recommend moving to from RH? Thanks
04/05/2021,stocks,"Lowball an aftermarket limit order and you might get lucky. 

I lowballed a call a few weeks go and it filled, still lost money, just.less of.it."
04/05/2021,stocks,"Always wondered how that could happen.  On extremely low volume maybe?  That essentially means there were no sell orders between 53 and yours (at 57) right, so the dude's broker just took what was available?"
04/05/2021,stocks,"I have no idea. It happened in after hours when the stock price jumped about 75 cents so I put the order out thinking it would maybe reach 60$ sometime this week, and it looks like it will."
04/05/2021,stocks,I just looked at the charts and it literally traded sideways for 2/25 years
04/05/2021,stocks,"You can make money on it, you have a say in the company's future. Most established companies have no majority shareholder, so if you had enough shares and worked with others, you could be a deciding vote in the company. Mostly, it's just that you make more money."
04/05/2021,stocks,"We all fall victim to learned helplessness from time to time, OP will be fine"
04/05/2021,stocks,"TLDR version

Greed, lots and lots of Greed. 


There you go."
04/05/2021,stocks,Anyone know how he amassed that wealth prior?
04/05/2021,stocks,Can this have any consequences for the market or lead to a financial crisis? (I'm not bearish just curious)
04/05/2021,stocks,"Why not just invest assuming everyone is lying to you..because you know, that’s kind of the truth."
04/05/2021,stocks,I mean in vancouver and where i live an average 30 year old home is 1.3 mil so if you were a billionaire here a 3 mil home isn’t anything too special
04/05/2021,stocks,What everyone is thinking.  Calls premiums probably already reflect that
04/05/2021,stocks,Exactly
04/05/2021,stocks,Worked a hedge fund called Tiger Capital. Look it up. Huge.
04/05/2021,stocks,"No. The fact that something was happening and banks were selling like crazy is a bit of old news (more than a week). Market handled it quite well actually. We all knew there were huge block trades and luckily it didn’t trigger huge sell off across the board. I just didn’t know why it happened. And now we know. 

I hope the result of this fiasco is that they tighten rules so that it doesn’t happen again. It could lead to something positive if actual changes are made. 

BTW, I can’t believe S&P is already up 1% this morning."
04/05/2021,stocks,Stupid question incoming: are you suggesting that by looking at instutional ownership status it could be a hedge not a hold? I watch some small cap stocks that I think are undervalued especially once they start getting large institutional buying and thought that was a good thing.
04/05/2021,stocks,I got in on TME with a small position.
04/05/2021,stocks,Where can I invest in this LUCK?
04/05/2021,stocks,You could make a 10 billion+ (minus the amount he made after he left) working there?  I get he was a high up but didn't know it was that lucrative.
04/05/2021,stocks,"That’s not how it works. They didn’t own shares, they owned total return swaps. He was borrowing from multiple banks and each bank didn’t know about the others. The fund is not required to disclose its deals with other banks. In addition it was a family office not a public fund so even less regulation and disclosure. It’s not really any particular employees fault."
04/05/2021,stocks,"Yes.
It LOOKS bullish if big tutes have big holdings but turns out that may not really be their position and instead they’re selling credit default swaps and other dervs to clients....."
04/05/2021,stocks,Spin the bottle
04/05/2021,stocks,"Hes actually one of the richest men. Hes totally loaded beyond the stock value.  And no the workers are not, unfortunately"
04/05/2021,stocks,Morgan and CS lost their own money on this. There will be flensing.
04/05/2021,stocks,">The fund is not required to disclose its deals with other banks.

The TRS risk is backed by collateral pledged by the hedge fund.

All other claims against the same collateral are disclosed or it's fraud.

If the bankers didn't even ask, especially knowing this guy's dirty history, that's when the trap doors open."
04/05/2021,stocks,Holy shit... that changes a lot. And this doesn't have to be revealed even though it is supposed to be ?
04/05/2021,stocks,"Ask yourself, why Viacom rose so much, so fast?
Because Archegos was buying lots of it.

Archegos is now bankrupt and won't buy lots of Viacom anymore.

So who do you hope is now going to buy lots of Viacom in their place, to push the price up again, for you to ride their coattails?

Reportedly, the banks Margin called Archegos because they realized that the fund had been a large mover of the stock price.
They could have waited for the stock to recover, before selling, but with Archegos now out of money they saw little chance for it to happen.

Before then and now the price has fallen more, so you may consider it a buying opportunity, but notice it's still way above where it was just at the start of the year. And the big buyer is out of the game."
04/05/2021,stocks,"They always say only invest what you're willing to lose. Assuming he followed this, that means he was willing to lose $30 Billion..."
04/05/2021,stocks,Workers are paid 17 an hour. That’s really good
04/05/2021,stocks,"Flensing -  strip (skin or fat) from a carcass.

Brutal."
04/05/2021,stocks,"He didn’t need to pledge the same collateral though. If he had $3b, he can pledge portions of it at different banks and have high leverage on each pledge because they might have assumed the other portions werent pledged. So if he had 5x leverage on 100m, in the scale of the 3b that’s really almost no leverage. But if he shops around and gets 5x leverage on all of it then he ends up with total leverage of 5x which is much riskier than any one bank would agree to."
04/05/2021,stocks,Say no more :)
04/05/2021,stocks,They're still treated like shit and 17 an hour doesn't justify that sadly
04/05/2021,stocks,Maybe he was covered. I suspect he pledged the same margin to everyone though.
04/05/2021,stocks,No one I know gets paid that. Quick search shows the dismal conditions of Amazon workers
04/05/2021,stocks,I honestly dont know how much they get paid.. It's way worse.. Isn't it? God damnit
04/05/2021,stocks,How much would I be losing in taxes about?
04/05/2021,stocks,"I've written DD this weekend on the subject that you may find useful.

https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mjcpfw/understanding_the_infrastructure_bill_the_federal/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share"
04/05/2021,stocks,Please buy and buy a lot as my wife and I are planning on user her autodesk shares as a down payment on a house.
04/05/2021,stocks,"This is a narrow minded view of the AEC industry. I've written comprehensive DD on the subject here.

https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mjcpfw/understanding_the_infrastructure_bill_the_federal/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share"
04/05/2021,stocks,Cool I’ll check it out!
04/05/2021,stocks,"Funny you say this. AutoDesk and Adobe have the same BS policies of charging clients ridiculous subscription fee’s for bloated software and no innovation.

Adobe is going away as well. Their moat is smaller than AutoDesk and there are a ton of competitive or superior products out there. As a designer who 3D models, does presentations, animations, photographs for clients, etc. the only Adobe software I still use is InDesign."
04/05/2021,stocks,What's narrow-minded? I'm just talking my experience. Never said anything which way to go with it
04/05/2021,stocks,"I totally agree, I just don’t think they’re going away as quickly as AutoDesk is. Photoshop definitely has competition and the subscription model will definitely push people away, but it’s still king and won’t be going away anytime soon. Plus they have other products like Substance Painter that I really don’t know if there will be an alternative for in the near future (besides maybe Blender as well, I don’t know). 

But seeing them pull moves like Fresco, charging a monthly fee which is the same as the one time payment for ProCreate and barely even competes with ProCreate when ignoring the price, yeah, I agree, they aren’t looking too hot. If I were to buy shares I’d only plan on holding for a few years."
04/05/2021,stocks,"I think it’s the opposite actually. Adobe gets by because they’re engrained in a lot of peoples workflows, but I can’t think of many if any programs in which they are the “best” or there’s not a reasonable equivalent. Photoshop is bloated and there are many competitors...easy to replace. They don’t have what I’d consider a top 10 sketch program, illustrator, Premiere, etc. can all easily be replaced. Even InDesign has direct competitors of repute.

I think people keep moving forward with Adobe because they are part of their workflows, which is powerful and has value, but 1:1 there’s no reason to choose an Adobe program for any specific job.

Autodesk on the other hand is more entrenched in their fields. You straight need AutoCAD to run a lot of tooling equipment, and there is no real competitor to Revit. Revit is also a contractually required deliverable for a lot of municipal and federal work.

Autodesk will be harder to unseat IMO. But regardless, when that day comes for either company I’ll tip back a beer and savor the moment. Absolute leeches those two companies.

Edit: for clarity, I know a ton of photographers who have left Adobe altogether because they went to a subscription system for Lightroom. (Me being one of them). Literally moved my entire library off of Lightroom and will never go back. Just not worth it."

The other week I woke up to emails from Facebook that first, a suspicious log in was attempted and then second, my password was changed. This person managed to change the password, email address and phone number associated with the account, completely skirting the two factor authentication. My decades long data no longer was my property. When I searched how to get in touch with Facebook to fix, there is no direct hotline. Other people online had complained it had been over 6 months without hearing from Facebook about next steps. 

I am just lucky that my friend works there and there is an internal tool for escalating issues for friends and family.  

I’ll be downloading my data and deleting the account."

04/05/2021,stocks,"Strangely no one seem to be questioning certain fundamentals of the company. Why does a company with a claimed 2.7Billion users only has data on 500M people leaked? Barring Indonesia (which records has not fully leaked), I would say Facebook has closer to 750-850 million users globally. Even then many users have stopped using Facebook or migrated to other platforms. This is the third time its been somewhat hacked.

04/05/2021,stocks,"I'm not sure about recent(ish) changes, but I remember a few years ago there was stuff circling around the data security community about how facebook retains your data even after you delete your account. Confirmable data was stuff like pictures you posted but had other people tagged would remain on that person's facebook in the tagged photos section. Beyond stuff like that, who knows what data they kept, but I assume close to everything useful for analytics. So, everything. There was a related claus in their ToS that nobody reads.

Back then to truly delete your account, you'd need to email support and make a formal request.

**I do not know if that's still their current data retention policy.** I will need to update myself next chance I get."

I just don't see a long runway of growth ahead of them, but I do see plenty of opportunity to either buy back stock or offer dividends, otherwise it feels like investors are being taken on a ride"
04/05/2021,stocks,Only time will tell I guess. And thanks man. It's not an investment for everyone but we'll see how it works out
04/05/2021,stocks,"What evidence do you have that they’re “losing high income users”? 2020 revenue: 86 billion vs. 70 billion in 2019 (+22% YoY). 2020 net income is up to 29 billion from 18 billion in 2019 (up 61% YoY), though 2019 net income was an anomaly due to fines. 2018 net income was 22 billion. Their huge cash positions allows them to not even blink an eye due to these “controversies”. Zuck keeps FB marching on.

Edit: I also want to add that they virtually have no debt, which is obscene for a company this size. FB has roughly 10 billion in debt (comically low) vs. apple (100+ billion in debt) vs Microsoft (70 billion) vs. intel (36 billion in debt)."
04/05/2021,stocks,"Facebook and IG are both seeing  declining user bases in North America and Europe. That is what terrifies me.

Agree that they are in a phenomenal financial position. Which is why I ask, yet again - why no dividend?"
04/05/2021,stocks,"Did you not see the earnings numbers I posted? Have you ever even looked at their quarterly reports? Why the hell would they destroy their fortress of a balance sheet to pay a paltry dividend? A huge reason for their success is because their management are masters at allocating capital while avoiding debt; I say keep that damn money and keep making me more money as a shareholder. I’m not a 60 year old retiree; wtf am I gonna do with a 1-4% dividend yield that I have to pay taxes on every quarter? I’d buy Coca Cola or McDonald’s if all I care about were dividends.... My FB position is up >120% in just the past 3 years alone and FB is still only trading at the same PE as Coca Cola, which actually does have declining revenues and earnings! I got decades of accumulating and holding left to do since they haven’t even monetized their messenger app yet, along with tons of untapped markets. Lord knows Zuck the robot lizard king has a plan for that shit.

Asking for a dividend from FB is the most boomer thing I’ve ever heard of. Cash is damn near worthless in this environment of unlimited money printing. If I got a dividend, I’d just end up buying more shares with it, only now I have to give Uncle Sam his cut..."
04/05/2021,stocks,"Lol I'm probably younger than you. 

I'm just saying if their balance sheet is so phenomenal than why aren't they taking care of their shareholders? Have they ever done a buyback? They're a mature company at this point. More so, I'd argue, than Google and Amazon, despite being younger. 

Great, Facebook is improving their ability to capitalize on existing users. I am legitimately impressed with how well they have done on this. 

This does not change the fact that the number of users in OECD countries is going the wrong direction. I'm not investing in a company that is losing users in America on the off chance the billion people if Africa will be able to all afford an iPhone some day."

04/05/2021,stocks,"Best advice i can give is to make sure your investments are diversified. 

In there you want some blue chip stocks, some stocks that are popular that are also relatively cheap at the moment but with good market caps and business models. Maybe put in 10-20% in more risky players.

A lot of people are interested in semiconductors and EVs at the moment, i would also consider averaging into tech over the course of the year, i think there are going to be a few more ""corrections"" where the whole market seems to dip by about 10%. I also wouldn't be surprised if there was a larger market crash, which i would be keeping some cash around for to buy tech deals like TSLA if it hits a big dip. 

Some stocks i am currently interested in, AMD, DQ, TSM, PSFE, PLTR, CRSR, Etsy, Apple, Disney, Spotify. Honestly shop around, there was a good post on here earlier where someone asked for peoples long term plays, plenty of ideas. From EVs to Asia plays to Tech and Genomics, Semiconductors is also the precursor to EVs. 

You could also look into investing in some ETFs, honestly it all depends on how you feel about risk. I am not very risk averse as i dont have a great deal invested (relatively young/new investor), if you go down the blue chip/ETF route which is extremely safe in the long term, then you can predict that you'll make decent gains year on year (better than in a bank account anyway).  

Also buy the dip, if you see a stock that fluctuates between 220$ and 240$, dont be a sucker and buy immediately just because you dont want to miss out (FOMO), the likelyhood of massive changes with a stock in a week are slim. So be patient, put buy orders in for the dips and wait it out. Or set alerts on stocks you like, IE when Etsy hits 200$ you get a notification and you can instantly go buy that stock, or PSFE at 14$ and buy it. 

Don't buy the peaks, always buy the dips, first lesson i learned that helps to keep my portfolio green :)"

04/05/2021,stocks,GME. All of it on GME. Fuck all the other boomer stocks mentioned here. You joined the stock market at the perfect time to witness history. GME
04/05/2021,stocks,"This is not financial advice whatsoever, you are the one in charge of choosing so. But with that said, it looks like I’m just in time since the stock market ain’t open 😉 I believe the best investment for your money on Monday is GME. This is due to, technical bullish signs, Fundamentals uptrends, and a potential for a great All Squeeze. GME on Thursday hit the oversold territory mark. When this happens, chances are likely that a bullish uptrend is about to happen, so when you hear the saying ‘buy low sell high’ this is the bread and butter of it. Buying near the current price will literally be buying the dip. Secondly, GME is undergoing massive structural changes in the leadership of GameStop and GameStop is being very bullish towards it. With good news coming every month so far since this year started. Plus, the e-commerce side of GameStop is really booming and is growing rapidly. The hedgefunds have heavily shorted GameStop at less that $2, and they still haven’t closed their positions yet. I believe GameStop will never hit less than $10 ever again this some form of squeeze is inevitable legally speaking. Though if the squeeze doesn’t happen, some illegal shenanigans is happening and that’s fine since you’ll still have good long term growth to fall back on and still make you good money on the stock as long as you hold. Thus, as long as you hold and not sell, either way I believe you’ll see gains through GME. And with a chance of a gigantic squeeze. Me personally I really like the risk to reward ratio. That’s personally why I’m all in on this with conviction. So me personally, I recommend $GME, though it’ll be down to you to pick what you do with your money. You are responsible for your investment choices"

I'm in deep position with NIO as well, and regret it as I didn't do my DD.  Tesla's strength isn't in it actual auto sales.  Longer term they're going to get a serious beat down in that arena.  If you want to post a more persuasive argument FOR Tesla, then talk software.  Fully autonomous driving is where they are ahead.  But don't tell a noob to get into TSLA as a car company play.

04/05/2021,stocks,I believe this may be because you bought at the top of the stock price which is a rookie mistake. You should always buy at the dips. Just hold out on your stocks.

I personally think this company will do very well in the future as technology further advanced and evolves with 5G technology and cyber crime evolves alongside it. This is a long term play. That means that it shouldn’t matter what the current price is since your not looking to sell right now. This is a company that made me 30% gain last year, sold all my shares to go all in on GME because I’m very bullish on its outlook. But I’ll be jumping back on to crowdstrike once I’ve made my profits. Just HODL if you believe in it as a company. If you think it’s a failing business then sell. That’s what it should come down to at the end before considering other factors. Good luck on your investing. This isn’t financial advice"

I work at Amazon and have something similar, guess the only pro is it automatically invests for me where I would have to get online and actually purchase my fraction of a share each week if I did it myself. I also notice they seem to buy at its highest that day. Amazon had mostly been under 3100 last couple weeks, the last purchase computer share made for me was 3165.xx and it was like the high for the entire week. March 23 or 24.

Now there may be some other perks at fedex that Amazon doesn’t offer, like a discount on the stock price"

04/05/2021,stocks,"Nintendo aren't really reinventing the wheel anymore. They seem to have learnt lessons from their failure consoles like the U and now have spoke about plans of basically just improving the base console each cycle. It's sorta what Apple have basically done this decade with the iPhone. Just making something familiar more and more powerful. 

I think this is the right move to keep a very loyal base. I grew up playing their games and have seen my decade younger brother playing the games and now see kids still playing the Switch. My mom is a childminder and I always ask what kinds things the kids she looks after are playing. I think Nintendo are onto a winner now and will continue to improve and add to their userbase as they go. 

I have a kid now and although he's too young for video games right now I can't imagine him not playing the Nintendo games over this next decade. Their old games are pretty evergreen unlike some other consoles and their new games should be exciting as the technologies continue to improve."
04/05/2021,stocks,"Not at all. First I think Buffett chose and groomed excellent successors. But more importantly Berkshire is essentially a self run behemoth.

Typical passive/aggressive behavior.

When the behavior is explained, then you lecture on how they are wrong, that is just a bully.  Bullies need to be called out for their boorish behavior.

Really am sorry that your home life, where no one listens or respects you, forces you to pick on strangers.  But alas bullies are shallow like that.  Always looking for a weaker person to try and dominate.  Particularly when the bully feels compelled to ""teach"" a stranger that the stranger is wrong.   And then when the stranger, you are attempting to ""educate"", does not heed your infantile tirade you resort to utilizing the same bullying that has been used on you.    Sad (notice the DTism).

There's going to be asset price inflation and stocks have already risen considerably, but actual real estate still has some more room to run(?). What do you think about this?"
04/05/2021,stocks,"Well, as I said, mREITs are a special case because of the extreme leverage and bright blinking sign of impending doom on their assets.

Other REITs are holding companies for actual real estate, which feels toppy because of the runup in RE prices in the last year.

But the way I see it, REITs involved in residential rental property could get a bit of a whack when eviction moratorium orders fall away; if that isn't priced-in yet. But there will be a reshuffling, and the infrastructure push will have people relocating and getting better jobs in droves, which is good for the rental and long-term stay and corporate-apartment businesses. So it depends on timing. CDC extended its moratorium rules until after June. The infrastructure deal is being haggled over.

Office REITs I'm unsure of. I just don't have insight into that market at all.

Retail REITs are probably screwed as long as Amazon exists. That business peaked the day Bezos said ""what if we sell more than books...""

Farmland REITs will stay solid.

I wonder if there's a beach condo REIT...short-term will sky, long-term will lose everything to rising sealevels..."
04/05/2021,stocks,"I would not be too quick or put too much in REITs. 

I did a bit of research. REITs made a ton of money from 2007 to 2010 because they had cash on hand to buy when everyone and their mother was selling. So they got really good deals. 

I would particularly stay away from office REITs for now until you can figure out whether people are going back to office or not. Cause if people shift to working from home and stay at home, I'm not sure how much office space will be worth."

04/05/2021,stocks,"Sure people could ""go somewhere else"" but it doesn't change the fact that specifically the graphics card market is insane and will remain that way for the probably a while given the perfect storm of issues.

Only Nvidia is using the Samsung 8nm process because they had a problem with TSMC and trying to book slots. It is evident when you compare how power efficient the RTX3000 series compared to the AMDs GPUs.

Also, it will be very difficult for AMD to produce their own chips. Even Nvidia, with their massive budget, does not produce them. Intel has been trying for years and have fallen behind because they are stuck with their 14nm++++++++++ process. They couldn't get the 10nm process working and they are considering going to TSMC until they are able to produce on a new process.

Keep in mind, Lisa Su just turned the ship around. It would be suicide if they tried to make their own chips at this point."

04/05/2021,stocks,"BB is Canadian, not only is Canadian but carries with it a iconic heritage. The government will not let it fail. I believe they will help support it up before it falls."
04/05/2021,stocks,"You still holding out hope from a 2 years old article?  Waymo and Tesla are throwing more money, more engineers AND are able to recruit better talent but somehow BB is going to sneak in there and beat them cause the feds gifted them 40mil and a bit of land (which the local universities also get to use). C’mon.

What BB/QNX have now with their level 2 autonomous vehicle platform has been done by many others.  There’s nothing novel about it.   I’m sorry but I don’t see them making the jump to level 3 or higher for various reasons.   GM released supercruise for Cadillacs a few years ago and that was already above level 2 and it’s fucking GM, yes GM, who’s not really known for this sort of thing.  QNX has been in  Ford cars for years now and judging by how often my truck’s lane assist loses track of the lane I sure wouldn’t rely on it for much."
04/05/2021,stocks,"Then why didn't the government help Blackberry when it was cratering after the iPhone destroyed its phone division?

04/05/2021,stocks,"you're missing my point, im not worry BB going BK for many of the above reasons. Plus to reach full autonomous driving like level 5 it requires 5G and the cloud network with zero latency. When that day comes all the work and effort put into cybersecurity  IOT QNX will converge with EV and autonomous driving."
04/05/2021,stocks,"i think this time around everybody knows it's a different ball game. BB was bold and cared less about what others had to say at the time. The lack of innovation in the cell phone era had had turned back the clock for alot of these companies not just BB. Now with new CEO and business BB has   setup new strategies, it's more open in approaching and receptive in their business model. ie partnerships."

No, Tesla didn’t beat the dealership model because of a lack of production- otherwise that reasoning would say that thousands of small companies could get a following and sell online. They don’t.

2. Yes, rare earth minerals are rare- they are in lots of places, but they’re hard to mine and China produces 90% of them because of a lack of environmental regulations and slave labor- so yeah, that makes them rare.

3. I said “Jaguar and others...” the second part of which you ignored because you’re not making arguments in good faith."
04/05/2021,stocks,"If Tesla was larger, no way could it support a build-to-order business model.

No, rare Earth metals are not rare. That's practically an idiom. The USGS says ""The rare earths are a *relatively abundant* group of 17 elements composed of scandium, yttrium, and the lanthanides."" There's more cerium than copper.

The only thing keeping them from being mined in most places is that China mines so much it's cheaper to buy from them. But their trade militancy is making other countries look at just paying more to be independent of them.

I'm making holes in your arguments in good faith towards the people you're trying to lie to."

04/05/2021,stocks,Lol you do know people said that nio and Tesla would fail before they were famous
04/05/2021,stocks,">What I'm saying is how much of Tesla success is Elon's management versus his hype and PR. Could Tesla have been even further ahead if someone else was in charge of actually running the company? I think they only exist as they do today because of hype for the companies and products versus the products themselves, as Elon has consistently over-promised features and delivery dates and his people caught up later.

It's his management. He has built several companies. He wouldn't have been able to do that if he wasn't successful at executing on his plans.

For example, Tesla is the first startup auto manufacturer in decades that has been able to survive. A lot of others have tried and failed.

How would ""hype"" be able to make a company successful? Hype for more than a decade?!

Your argument isn't even making sense.

>Elon is not actually that good at building cars or rockets. His entire management style appears to be come up with a crazy idea while all the employees around around him works 80-120 hours a week to make it happen. He's a notorious micromanager, and you can wonder if that's to the detriment of his businesses.

Actually, it's the other way around. He is very open to

That tent at the Fremont factory that all the nay-sayers are ridiculing? That was actually something Jerome Guillen came up with, not Musk.

Detriment of his businesses?! Uh, again, Tesla is the only new American car manufacturer to survive since **decades**.

>His companies are also notorious for abusing his people, making them work excessive hours under incredible stress to get things done. His hype and PR work, people want to work for those companies, but I do wonder if it's sustainable in the long run.

Yeah, those stories were debunked a long time ago. Actual employees beg to differ:

[https://www.glassdoor.com/Overview/Working-at-Tesla-EI\_IE43129.11,16.htm](https://www.glassdoor.com/Overview/Working-at-Tesla-EI_IE43129.11,16.htm)

Also, what does this have to do with PR and hype? Seems like you are just making up stuff as you go in order to smear him.

At some point, you have to ask yourself if your own position even makes sense. This guy started with his own skills, and built several successful companies, and is now one of the richest people on the planet. He is launching astronauts into space in reusable rockets, and is disrupting the auto industry.

Only hype and PR? Really? Hype and PR built several companies?! Do you really believe you own nonsense?"

04/05/2021,stocks,Are they like a temp agency? They place people into jobs?
04/05/2021,stocks,"Definitely not, even when talking about active investing etf like ARK funds or MOON etf, they are actually 50% active and 50% passive. They hold 30+ stocks and the mostly stick to their highest conviction stocks for 5-10 years cycle. Real active investing is really go all out and rebalncing nearly all the portfolio to stocks that will likely see the biggest short term gains and keep rotating. So when people talking about active etfs they are actually not really full blown active investing.

Another thing is that value investors are actually way more active in their trades than growth stocks investors. Because most value investors are investing what is most undervalued at the current moment while growth investors usually have a 5 year window. Thus value investors rebalance their portfolio extremely aggressively and frequently to try and capture the stocks that has the most gain in the within a short timeframe."

04/05/2021,stocks,"Lol my guy do whatever you want, all I did was tell you that 1% per day is ridiculous because it is, as confirmed by the fact that if you actually get 1% per day that's 1200% per year which no one gets, including the guy you're trying to use as evidence that you could. I havent downvoted anything of yours, I dont care enough to."
04/05/2021,stocks,"That guy as you so quaintly put it created the fidelity magellan fund, the most successful mutual fund in the history of the stock market. His book, “one up on wall street” is a good read. He is a contemporary of Warren Buffet, who also loves the idea of compounding."
04/05/2021,stocks,"Lol dude I know who Peter fuckin Lynch is, which is why I used him as an example of an exemplary investor who still didnt get 1% per day returns. 

Also, it sounds like you dont understand what compounding is, because you're using it to defend flipping between stocks as if that's how you get compounding. You know literally everyone in the stock market gets compounding returns right? Even if you park your money in an index fund for 30 years those returns are compounding returns.

Finally, you seem to think I said you cant make any money trading stocks. I never said that, you can make money trading stocks. What I criticized is that you were aiming for a 1% per day return and thought it was ""doable"" which any investor who's spent any time trading knows is ridiculous which is why you got downvoted."
04/05/2021,stocks,"Well, you never mentioned him before, so a reasonable assumption that you may not have heard of him. 

If you park your money in an index fund, only if it pays dividends that are reinvested do you compound. No dividends, no compounding Then its just growth. So any stock that does not pay dividends, there is no compounding, such as tesla. You park 1000 in it and the value increases by 25% year on year you only grow 25%. Thats not compounding, so I think the data you have about that subject is wrong. 

Finally, I have neither stated nor implied what you think about selling stocks. I was wondering about your negativity and seeming anger."
04/05/2021,stocks,"Dude you really dont understand compounding. If I have a stock worth $100 and it grows by 25% and gains $25 it is now worth $125, then the next year it grows by another 25% and gains $31.25 and is now worth $156.25, then the next year it grows by 25% and gains $39, and is now worth $195.31. You see how the amount it grows by keeps going up? That's compounding. By year three it is worth 100% more, even though you only had 3 periods of 25% growth, meaning it had an annualized 33% return each year even though it never returned more than 25% in a single year.

https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/compoundreturn.asp

Like I said in my original comment, this is really incredibly basic stuff, the fact that you dont understand it means that you should be doing way more research before you fully dive in.

04/05/2021,stocks,"I’m surprised and not surprised at the same time. I sort of expected a couple of Wall Street AI developers to pop up in this thread and tell us how this all works.

We are left with speculation.

I imagine that the first “level” of a stock market AI would be the high speed trading systems we all hear about when they go wacky. A set of rules that say, if you see the stars align do this. All those technical chart things like double bottoms and such.

The second level might be an AI that can discover those rules (and relationships) that have not yet been discovered.

A third level might be an AI that becomes a part of how traders trade.

A open source project intending to produce such a system would be fascinating but might have some headwinds.

The people that know how to do this might be constrained by NDA’s.

These systems work because they have very fast access to the trading backbone and have lots of very fast storage and processing requirements. A open source project would need to provide these expensive requirements somehow. 

Something very interesting to think about."

04/05/2021,stocks,"Sector rotation into utilities and defensives while spy was trending up everyday and Arkks was tanking strangely enough despite growing in followers? Who would have predicted that?  

Hedge funds and Wall Street have the most to lose if Cathies Ark continues to succeed.  Why pay 50% commission when you're outperformed by a nonhedgie who charges 1/20?  Hedge funds could be and will be wiped out in the next few years except maybe Renaissance.  

I buy calls and puts based on TA and DD on wsb for years, and when Dec - Feb almost any decently well written DD that hadnt experienced huge options activity already could be moved easily by just a few hundred RH users simultaneously buying calls.  Even 1 billion + market caps!!

Now we have 5 times the members since Jan, and even the best DD is much more risky and requires a longer time frame.

This in conjunction with the fed repo market allowing anyone with the right registrations to borrow billions at .01% in overnight funds is a recipe for shorts to over leverage themselves short on Arkk plays.  

The utilities were already sitting at all time highs, basically prior to renewed interest in Bidens infrastructure bill, fear of inflation is leading to speculation I fail to see how such a drastic swing could have occurred naturally into defensives without the above as prerequisite."

Obviously from the data you could pretty much throw a dart at 5 stocks with a Reddit score under 500 and end up profitable in a week, but that doesn't help when you're looking at 450 stocks and you aren't sure which ones to pick.

So starting tomorrow I'm going to include conversation % increase/decrease into the sheets and see if that can narrow down the categories.

04/05/2021,stocks,"That's fucked up man, a dying wish is one of the most important things for someone, death is a passage, and tho the body is just a vessel, it's a vessel for one of the most sacred energies that exist, the soul. The dead deserve respect no matter what.
