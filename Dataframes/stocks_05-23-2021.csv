2021-05-23 19:25:29,stocks,People can recommend stocks just fine but you gotta figure out how to calculate 1k a years from dividends yourself. No one knows how much you’re investing a month or literally any other details.
2021-05-23 19:29:46,stocks,"Just use the dividend yield x invested amount and you'll get your estimated dividends/year. ~$33,000 @ 3% is about 1k per year."
2021-05-23 19:51:13,stocks,I prefer PEP over KO because they are a more diversified business and you also see more share appreciation than KO. Don’t get me wrong though KO is still really good and I don’t see them going anywhere in the future.
2021-05-23 19:51:22,stocks,Check out $OKE

2021-05-23 19:32:51,stocks,At&T dividends are 6.93%
2021-05-23 19:30:30,stocks,My favorite slow growth dividend stock is Flower Foods
2021-05-23 19:49:33,stocks,Damn very high dividends for the price
2021-05-23 19:45:26,stocks,"Not anymore bud!

Slash that in half! I own 150 shares. Discovery merger/company spin off."
2021-05-23 19:33:29,stocks,Is that the most bang for its buck? Ko is cheap and pays pre good dividends
2021-05-23 19:33:45,stocks,Whats the ticker?
2021-05-23 19:36:02,stocks,Currently T is at$30 with 6.93% and KO is $50 with 3.08% but this is not advice. Just opinion.
2021-05-23 19:42:59,stocks,At&t just cut their dividend in half
2021-05-23 19:45:55,stocks,Very true
2021-05-23 19:45:49,stocks,Is it now 1 dollar or what?
2021-05-23 17:54:37,stocks,I’m buying AAPL to hold for the next 20 odd years. What do 10 months matter?
2021-05-23 19:07:09,stocks,"Depends on your goals if you want to continue being 100% specialized in a good stock like AAPL or if you want to diversify to minimize risk while still maintaining some exposure to AAPL through an ETF.

Honestly, AAPL is a pretty safe company to invest in because of their increased dividends, massive profits, and growing subscription services which might warrant their higher P/E. I think AAPL is doing the right fundamental changes to their business like the Apple M1 chip to their Mac products, weareables, and growing streaming services like Apple Music and Apple TV. Sure, they might not be as popular as their competitors but Apple is certainly diversifying their influence across their user base to provide more consistent revenue in the future.

I think AAPL is also objectively a long term hold due to their massive influence in most ETFs like the SPY, DIA, and QQQ. Their massive market cap makes it difficult to swing up or down too quickly and should be a stable long-term hold for investors. The fact that AAPL hasn’t done much since August 2020 is actually bullish given the stock could be ready for a massive move upwards since investors could look for opportunities for more upside from Apple in terms of technicals and fundamentals. I believe AAPL’s financials look extremely strong and any more weakness in the stock price will actually lower their P/E ratio substantially to look like a value play for a growth stock. Remember their last earnings were so good the P/E dropped from ~36 to 28 right now. For comparison, MSFT’s P/E still looks more inflated than AAPL at the moment."
2021-05-23 18:12:10,stocks,"You bought almost at their peak for this year. If you had bought it in July 2020, it would have been anywhere from 91-96$ range. Apple is worth the investment, and a pretty safe bet to rebound if the market crashes. It should be a long term hold, if the stock didn’t go up the way you expected this year, hold. If it goes down next year, hold and buy more."
2021-05-23 19:32:49,stocks,"I don't want to be rude but isn't that exactly the wrong way to invest? You are considering VTI 'because it has gone up 24%'. I don't even know where to begin with criticising that statement. 

Plus, Apple was at a price of 40 at the start of 2019, so that's a 3x gain in 3 years. If it was the start of 2019, wouldn't you want to buy more while it's consolidating, not sell it because it hasn't gone up?"
2021-05-23 18:39:42,stocks,Ive been in since 2015. Over 400% Returns and is almost 50% of my portfolio. Just put your money into it and forget about it.
2021-05-23 17:52:35,stocks,If I’m buying Apple I care about the 10 year growth not what happens in 10 months
2021-05-23 18:11:10,stocks,"Time of entry matters, I was in before 2020 epic bull run on Apple. Still holding, though it is trading sideways for a while but that’s a much needed consolidation. During this consolidation phase many good things happened with Apple, for me most important is it’s service revenue grew. I am loaded and ready for next bull run."
2021-05-23 18:16:15,stocks,I don’t mean this in a rude way everyone has their own investing style but if this is your mindset you should just go to an etf. Almost all of my multibaggers have had bad/losing periods as well as consolidation periods for months or years. If anything a long consolidation is a necessary step for the stock to move higher. These companies have to grow into their hefty valuations.
2021-05-23 17:59:27,stocks,Post the minute you do this. Please and thank you.
2021-05-23 17:55:23,stocks,Do you need the money now or in 10 years?  If it is a long term hold you should be fine
2021-05-23 19:42:22,stocks,Bought it for my 401k long term hold
2021-05-23 18:05:42,stocks,"Biggest best company on earth
..I'll take a few hundred shares"
2021-05-23 19:42:00,stocks,"You’re clearly insanely short sighted.. probably a new investor.

50% of my portfolio is Apple & it’s staying that way."
2021-05-23 19:44:20,stocks,"The main reason I continue to hold 90 shares of Apple is I'm a bit worried about a stock market crash and I figure with the $90 billion buy back program, that should protect me from much of the impact of a broader crash. That, combined with the fact the stock is likely to continue to grow, makes it a fairly safe place to store some safety money.

On the downsides, I don't think most people are going to continue to be willing to pay $1000 for smartphones every year when you can get great smartphones for $250 that will last you several years. But people may continue to surprise me.

Also, I feel like I increasingly hear about problems with Apple products that I don't experience with the similar products that cost 1/5 as much. I'm a software developer and very technical so I don't recommend discounting my opinion there.

I don't see how the M1 chip is going to be a game changer when computers are already much more powerful than people need. The processor is almost never the bottleneck anymore, it is usually the hard drive for most tasks or the graphics card for gaming.

Apple TV by most accounts is lame except for Ted Lasso. Apple Music isn't as good as other options. 

But I've owned Apple since 2003. I have, unfortunately, sold half my shares several times and have made lots of money from it. There is no question it has been an amazing stock but it's continued dominance are far from certain as its current products are in commodity areas now.

So, there's my thoughts."
2021-05-23 18:06:04,stocks,"I worry about apples long term growth, I mean if you have to stop giving out headphones to squeeze more money how much growth can be left..

I suppose there next move will be eliminating hard drives so people have to subscribe to a cloud storage netting them monthly profits..

It is a great company, but they have had 0 innovation since Steve Job's and I would say quality has declined as well..

I think they will grow more, but unless they make some break through into other revenue sources outside of phones there is only so much that can be squeezed..

I would hold, though I wouldn't expect monster gains..."
2021-05-23 17:58:10,stocks,"While the decision to move funds into VTI may be a good decision, I don’t agree at all with the reasoning. 

Do you have a target price for Apple? If so, what factors and assumptions have you made to arrive at that target price? I ask because this would help you understand (what you believe) the intrinsic fair value of the company is today. If it’s undervalued in your eyes, I wouldn’t “sell low” and would in fact consider adding to my position. If it’s fairly- or overvalued, you might have more of a reason to sell if you see a better investment."
2021-05-23 18:27:27,stocks,"No one can fault you for switching AAPL with VTI. That said, I think you are being too harsh on AAPL. Give it more time please. If it helps you sleep better at night, why not sell 50% in favor of VTI and hang onto both?"
2021-05-23 19:00:01,stocks,Better not to touch it.
2021-05-23 18:05:25,stocks,Can you take this Apple concern to a Boomer section. Apple is sitting at 2 trillion market cap and 200 billion in cash reserve. Other stocks need more love and attention
2021-05-23 18:11:34,stocks,The apple watch and the m1 chips are pretty innovative..
2021-05-23 18:35:32,stocks,"First of all they didn't ""have to"" they decided themselevs to stop giving out headphones (which was innovative and all major smartphone brands decided to follow suit!) And in hindsight it was a great decision as this definitely contributed to how well the air pods sold. 
I'd argue there is still a lot to be squeezed. they've just started to focus more on subscription based services, which could and in my opinion will greatly increase revenue.
And also the m1 chips, if you understand the capabilities of this chip you'd know that this will change laptops forever. if that isn't Innovation what is?"
2021-05-23 18:12:27,stocks,I never liked iPhone. I like Steve Jobs but not Tim Cook. However those didn't prevent me from owning AAPL. It's a cult. Don't try reasoning. Just hold it.
2021-05-23 18:41:34,stocks,"Oh and to add, that actually sounds like a great idea. If in the future somehow they could somehow c̵o̵n̵v̵i̵n̵c̵e̵ force people to pay a yearly fee for cloud storage and their hard drives are only solely to run IOS. 
I wouldn't put it past them, this is the same company that had their phone sell in record numbers even though they didn't include a charger"
2021-05-23 18:25:01,stocks,"Not really, iPod was, iTunes was, iPhone was..computer quality was...iPhone was more of a replacement to iPod...
The watch is on par with the apple desktop, it is really a commodity item...not really something people need...not something that is going to drive profits forward..and the smart watch was in the works since jobs was alive.."
2021-05-23 18:39:49,stocks,"“Change laptops forever” is a overstatement..M1 is not that innovative...

Oh and they squeeZed by removing chargers.."
2021-05-23 18:47:11,stocks,"Yeah, but you can only expand the business so much by eliminating chargers and headphones..

I’m not knocking apple, just seems there profits are limited to just compounding on what they have...and how much they can cut to expand...I’m sure they will grow more but there are many opportunities in the market that will likely give you better returns."
2021-05-23 18:49:30,stocks,"How exactly won't they change laptops forever?
Do you understand what these chips are capable of?"
2021-05-23 19:14:26,stocks,"Yes, I’m very well versed on computers and technology.."

2021-05-23 18:22:51,stocks,"Each share gets its own hold period---it's not the entire ticker. For instance, if you buy 2 shares of XYZ today and sell 1 in 4 days, the one that you sold in 4 days would be a position held for a short term. If you sold the other 3 years later, it would be a position held for a long term.

&#x200B;

IDK if it's really FIFO as others have suggested bc you can actually change lot assignments."
2021-05-23 19:04:32,stocks,"Check out FIFO, LIFO and HIFO. It's up to you how you want to calculate gains"
2021-05-23 19:53:41,stocks,"Each time you buy it sets a holding period for those share you purchased.  So your first purchase of, say, ten shares is held for over a year, those ten shares are long term.  If your last purchase of say, two shares, is held for less than a year those 2 shares are short term."

2021-05-23 19:18:30,stocks,Calling robinhood a brokerage is generous
2021-05-23 18:25:02,stocks,"Even more reason for ppl not to use them. ""Yes, use our app and make money, but screw yourself over in taxes bc you can only sell FIFO."" WTF? But, if you stay with them long enough to make a few trades and not even realize that this feature isn't available, you probably wouldn't know what you're missing anyway. That's the sad part."
2021-05-23 18:01:14,stocks,"To expand further, this is called your 'cost basis method' and most brokerage firms will let you chose from several options. The default is usually First In First Out but there is also things like Highest In First Out (HIFO) and Spec ID, which lets you pick the specific shares you want to sell. If you go with Spec ID, you could exclude the shares you bought in March from the sale so you don't get hit with short term cap gains tax."
2021-05-23 17:48:02,stocks,"If you're reinvesting dividends, the last purchase will be a trivial part of the whole sale. Thus, you can add  all dividends to the cost basis and determine the difference between that and the sale price.   It's a long term profit (or loss). 

Purchase *date* is listed as *various*

Your DCA strategy falls under FIFO reporting."
2021-05-23 18:11:43,stocks,You can go and click view tax lots and it'll show you each lot and I believe you can sell each lot separately.
2021-05-23 19:56:50,stocks,"I use E*TRADE and can confirm you can view tax lots and choose which to sell (as others have said).  Keep in mind though different stocks can have different tax liabilities, especially if the stock is foreign."

2021-05-23 19:02:17,stocks,"""ish."" From a long term/short term perspective I've, FIFO may be beneficial enough. If it's a long term holding, you might hold shares you picked up @$50, and the stock is now at $380 10 years later (see: $COST). You might preference shares you purchased a year and a day ago (re: ltcg) as opposed to FIFO to save on th actual gains."
2021-05-23 19:01:50,stocks,"Yeah theyre thinking LIFO, Last in first out."
2021-05-23 19:03:53,stocks,"Shouldn't they do it on cost basis, which is different from FIFO."
2021-05-23 19:08:46,stocks,What do you mean? Why would it be to your advantage to sell your newer shares? Isn’t it more beneficial to sell the first shares you bought? Or do you mean something else?
2021-05-23 18:16:41,stocks,There is also minimum tax method. Which is basically HIFO if you have cap gains but long-term shares take precedence.
2021-05-23 19:28:51,stocks,They don't even process your shares they just give you an iou and they can liquidate your account without notice. So one of your stocks is going up they can sell it if its not in their best interest for you to make money on that stock. Read the fine print in robinhoods terms and conditions. Its there.
2021-05-23 19:34:17,stocks,IBKR has less than 1%
2021-05-23 19:55:11,stocks,"That rate sounds nice and it's better than the rate that I have, but it's not even worth the worry that they'd screw up my acct. The extra money is worth the peace of mind, IMO."

2021-05-23 18:58:37,stocks,"But why when Fidelity gives you your money quicker, easy ACH withdrawal/deposits, and good customer service if you have questions about your account. 

Only draw backs to Fidelity are the fewer stock options under $1 and the app looks like it was made for a boomer. I prefer using the Webull app for looking at tickets but place the trades on Fidelity. Also Fidelity’s app is delayed 15mins for some and Webull is market time. I’ve made a small trade a few times and it was immediately up tens of dollars just because I saw the ticker on Webull, saw an increase and it wasn’t registering on Fidelity yet."
2021-05-23 19:13:19,stocks,Username checks out
2021-05-23 19:31:23,stocks,"Most people here, but not most people."
2021-05-23 19:15:55,stocks,"I don't think stocks can be sold that way, due to IRS regulations and the fact that each stock is itself a complete unit of ownership.

Each unit has its own purchase price and associated gain/loss that is taxable.  

This is different for mutual funds which are taxed on overall cost basis.

At least this is my understanding of it all, based on my tax statements from fidelity."
2021-05-23 19:48:23,stocks,FIFO isn't always the best option. It depends on your tax strategy. You should research tax loss harvesting and wash sales. I bet you're paying more taxes than you need to.
2021-05-23 19:26:12,stocks,"Yes, but Robinhood doesn’t allow you to do that because they’re fucking garbage."

2021-05-23 15:20:49,stocks,"Airlines are incredibly risky to invest in currently. Many have substantial debt accumulated in the last year as a result of the pandemic. Air travel has still not recovered to pre-pandemic levels and it's not clear when/if it will return 100%. 

I'm not saying you couldn't get lucky and pick that one airline that flourishes, however, more than likely you're looking at an early 2000 airline fiasco all over again. Consolidation, changing routes, changing customer demands, etc."

They are generally my fav airline (southwest isn't big at my local airport) They let me cancel a flight to FL with almost no issues. I prefer their service and conditions  so I at least believes in the company too. But also it was down a lot under $16 dollars at the time and I figured stuff would come back some day. I bought some more at $30 but now at $44 I'm not sure i want to put more in. I'm more confident in people flying now and it sounds like there's still a lot of pent up demand. I am less sure in huge long term potential or what companies did the best with saving, and loses during the pandemic, have you looked into which airlines you were interested in and how they are fareing"
2021-05-23 19:17:47,stocks,"I'd not call them cheap. They have little runway (pun) left before reaching their ATH pre-covid. Remember how much debt they had to take on to survive Covid. International travel is not coming back until the rest of the world catches up with vaccination. 

This is based on fundamentals. Short term hype and momentum can make anything happen."

2021-05-23 16:07:51,stocks,"I think you're on the right track, anything that deals with entertainment and travel should have a decent comeback over the next year.

I got into Cruise stocks about March and April of last year. They've kind of stagnated awaiting for cruising to kick off again.

So I started exploring different airlines, looked at American and united, looks like United might be a better bet.

But to go along with the airlines, if they start flying, they're going to start ordering airplanes... So I chose to invest in things related to the purchase of new aircraft.  I chose to go after boeing, and whenever there's a few dollars left in my brokerage account, I buy a few shares of Rolls-Royce.

Boeing has had an order of f-15ex aircraft for the United States Air force, an order of f-15QA for the Qatar Air Force, an option exercised on 15 more refueling aircraft for the Air Force, and a contract for up to 60 commercial aircraft... Along with a bunch of maintenance and logistic contracts.

Rolls-Royce is in the running for the contract for re-engineing the B-52 aircraft, supposed to happen second half of this year. If they win that contract, should be 600 plus engines for that.

Anyhow, I do think that long-term the airline stock will pay off, or anything to do with entertainment and travel."
2021-05-23 17:57:57,stocks,"There is so much uncertainty right now with airline stocks that it feels more like a gamble than an investment. While it’s highly unlikely that any of the major airlines will go belly up, how exactly they’ll fare post-COVID is anyone’s guess. How much have they already lost? How will they recover those losses? Will price hikes turn customers away more than bring them back? I’m avoiding airlines until some degree of stability returns. I’d rather not try to blindly “get lucky” with one of them."

If not and CCL stagnates about 40, I'll start looking for a new investment to replace it."

2021-05-23 15:34:09,stocks,"Here's a helpful [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/gl6zrm/a_historical_look_at_the_airlines/).

If airline travel is down then their is a trickle-down effect on the economy. Rental car companies will suffer. Hotels will suffer. Local restaurants/shops will suffer.  

The rental car industry is an ideal example right now. They sold off significant portions of their fleet when demand evaporated. They're now struggling with too little supply and increasing demand. The industry will recover, but at what cost to individual companies. 

Unless you're an industry insider, the entire travel industry should be avoided by the novice retail investor. If you want exposure, consider what others have said and invest in a sector ETF."
2021-05-23 15:27:22,stocks,"Or bet on an airline, or buy into an airline ETF so you invest in all airlines."
2021-05-23 17:00:10,stocks,"I just invested in what I was familiar with.  Kind of got lucky in my timing and the cruise stocks that I picked.  I think cruise lines stock share values are over inflated for where they are right now...bleeding money... But I think there's still another 25 to 33% left for it to go up when they're full up and running...however long that takes.

If you are into cruising, look at whatever company you normally Cruise with. Appears many have Perks for shareholders.  CCL and RCL require you to have at least 100 shares. I'm guessing the other cruise lines have the same or similar.   So if nothing else, you'll get some extra onboard cash or whatever from your investment."

2021-05-23 14:22:44,stocks,I think TSM is the clear winner of the three. Intel is finally losing market share in server and until they demonstrate that they can scale their current and next nodes I won’t buy. Their business is built to run on very high margins so a fab spinoff for them would be a disaster sign. The fact that they are buying wafer capacity from their only real rival is a bad look.
2021-05-23 15:49:55,stocks,What? TSM does not have 80% market share lol. Its more like 56% Samsung has 18%

2021-05-23 19:10:00,stocks,"TSM is the best one long term in terms of fundamental picture. I’d add LRCX and ASML as long term holds in the semiconductor industry.

2021-05-23 15:47:30,stocks,This applies if you're looking only at the semiconductor foundry industry/market. However samsung is not a bad choice as a whole just due to its massive size and diversification. And their foundry effectively has a captive customer in the form of their mobile division (exynos). Also qualcomm would rather get their chips manufactured at samsung rather than TSMC because Apple has priority at TSMC.
2021-05-23 18:39:29,stocks,"US is blocking ASML from sharing the important tech right now......gotta see how long that keeps up.....

2021-05-23 19:39:17,stocks,IBM while this foundry competition in their backyard heats up is enticing. The manufacturing IP companies have yet to see the competition for their IP heat up with it.

To do a successful land invasion and occupation across the sea is a D-Day level event in terms of logistics and military capabilities, especially considering Taiwan’s entire military is specifically built around repelling an invasion across the Taiwan straight. And these days that’s especially not easy to do considering how far military tech has come. A handful of drones, well placed artillery, and something to launch torpedoes and missiles would be able to sink any ships that try to cross. 

As if invasion wasn’t difficult enough, trying to do an occupation would certainly lead to almost the entire population unifying in resistance, probably along with the US, Japan, Australia, India, Western Europe, among many other countries. While if an invasion happens it’s not guaranteed to bring down unified international sanctions or counterattacks, that’s still too big of a risk for China to take on considering how integrated they still are in the global economy."

If you've been interested in the stock market from october 2020, seen the incredible climb of those stocks till january/feb then realise that with covid opening up inflation is going to spike as the globe realises manufacturing and production isn't what it was, then you need to assess how and when you take profits and come up with strict guidelines.

Especially when you hear about the big boys like buffet, burry and dalio collecting cash since september 2020. Some of these guys did pre-empt it, Buffet missed a massive bull run on some positions.

As a British investor with US stocks, inheritance is a little complicated, but where liable, I will pay tax on the value of my estate. Depending on where my shares sit (ISA, private pension, taxable investments), what age I die, whether my wife is still alive, and whether I use a trust will all determine what I pay. But it will all be subject to UK regulation, not US."
2021-05-23 16:39:42,stocks,I'm Canadian so things are similar here with US stocks. My understanding is that US estate tax doesn't apply until you have over 5 million dollars.

2021-05-23 19:52:10,stocks,Hasn't the squeeze already happened on these stocks.. Seems like dead money now or what. Surely hedges will not make the same mistake again and will learn from it.. I dunno but seems unlikely IMO for any serious movement of 100%-300% moves in one day again right?
2021-05-23 15:18:35,stocks,I want to agree with you but then you had to bring up naked shorting.  What happened with GME wasn't even naked shorting.  There has been zero evidence of naked shorting.  If you borrow shares to short a stock it is not naked shorting.  Failure to deliver does not necessarily mean naked shorting occurred. It can also occur if you sell your shares that your broker has loaned out and they cannot get the shares back in time for settlement.  Eventually the person they loaned them to has to close their position if they cannot locate other shares to return.  I bring up failure to deliver because that is what all the conspiracy minded people bring up as proof of naked shorting and GME had a high rate of failure to deliver (mainly because the volume was such a high % of the float at the same time the short interest was so high).  I am not saying that naked shorting doesn't happen but it does not happen as frequently as people on reddit think it does.  The fact that you think they can do it legally through loopholes would mean that it would not be illegal.  Those loopholes you describe are what makes the shorts not actually naked.
2021-05-23 13:47:42,stocks,So then how the hell was/ is their short interest 140%. If they can do it in the short direction why not in the long direction

2021-05-23 15:32:44,stocks,"Ok that makes sense, but I swear I've read that there are avenues to be ""naked short"" without technically doing anything illegal. But maybe thats just the terminology that sources have used to describe what you stated, where they can use those ""loopholes"" to mimic a naked short without actually doing it.

I think in my other comment back to OP's reply that quote explains it better with the settlement time and the amount short on paper vs in reality."
2021-05-23 13:54:31,stocks,"Literally if you google ""how can over 100% of the float be shorted"" the first link is a reuters article explaining it. It would have taken you 5 seconds to google your question and get an answer.

From that article: 

""Once the short seller borrows the shares from the lender and then sells them back into the market, the new owner of the shares is free to lend them out, just as the previous owner did, and have no idea they are on the other side of a short sale

Settlement time is two days after the transaction. In that time, the same shares can be lent out again, and again. This makes it possible, on paper, for more than 100% of the float of a stock to be shorted.
According to financial analytics firm S3, GameStop's peak short interest was 141.8% of its float on Jan. 4.
S3 argued in a recent research note that the traditional method of calculating the percentage of float is flawed because it uses stale data. U.S. investors are required to mark their shares shorted and regulators report these figures twice a month, with a 10-day delay, S3 said."""

2021-05-23 13:54:26,stocks,"Hedge funds can essentially can short as many shares of a company as they want - it’s not that difficult. But it’s still kept in the books as a short position, so someone is long on the opposite side of the trade. You can imagine if the company bankrupts then there’s no need to cover. Reciprocally, if the company survives the short attack (there haven’t been many, but overstock OSTK is a good example), then there will be an inevitable squeeze."
2021-05-23 13:54:28,stocks,"They cant just keep naked shorting the stock. 

As a market maker they are allowed to do some naked shorting in order to keep the liquidity in the stock (which is strange as it kind of defeats the purpose of buy and demand) but they need to have the intention of getting a stock and keep a record for every transaction. This means they cannot keep the position open for long and they need to get a stock. This means they cannot just create shares"
2021-05-23 13:50:41,stocks,"Fair enough, essentially companies like Citadel aren’t shorting companies based on float, they’re making deals with other companies with more unconventional contracts to maximize their downside/short exposure. I’m sure they could settle some of their shorts strictly with cash rather than shares if they wanted to. Might be something I’d have to look into further though"

2021-05-23 13:59:49,stocks,"So that sounds like a feedback loop. They borrow from a guy that loans, they put that into the market. Someone else gets that new shorted share. What if they also got a loan to short? So they shorted too. 

What if all those shorters is just one person or hedge fund. What if they’re using proxy’s or the dark pool to secretly make the trades. 

If they can borrow and short, couldn’t they just borrow as much as they want if the bank or loaner is in on it and is 99% confident that the loan will result in a huge pay day on top of the return of their original loan amount?

And now that people are aware; they could mask it more by dark pool trading the direction they want it to go, but trade in a public brokerage to make the level 2 data look like the opposite of their intentions, creating extra profit through manufactured bull/bear traps?"
2021-05-23 13:53:18,stocks,"The basic thing I do understand is that there are people in our markets with more power than should be allowed. From stopping the purchasing of shares, to manipulating prices, to having trade data on the users. 

Then on top of that they have dark pools where they can make transactions that nobody can see.

So what if they’re able to make deals with MM to push agendas like suppress certain stocks/company’s/ inventions. Whether it’s for agenda reasons or just money making.


With dark pools what if they’re hiding the “fake” shares they buy/sell against a stock and watch the dominos follow in a delayed manner after their original transaction is executed (on the dark pool)?"

2021-05-23 14:04:10,stocks,"I dont really get what you're trying to say to be honest, so I'll just give a quick example.

Person A: Borrows share from Person B and then sells it to Person C.

Person D: Borrows that share from person C that was shorted by Person A and then sells it to Person E.

So you can see how these shares can circulate quickly and one share can then count as 2 shorted shares, leading to high % of float shorted."
2021-05-23 13:56:28,stocks,"I mean look at the history of shorts, it’s not super uncommon for good companies to be driven into the ground. The problem lies more in the way that the SEC punishes big firms. It’s less punitive and more a wrist slap. The best thing you can do is to vote for politicians that you think will push for new financial legislation. All in all though, it’s not something that’s big enough to crash the market as a whole. It’s definetly possible that some individual holdings of struggling investment managers may struggle as a result though.

Once they are back operating at normal capacity, I don't think there will be much trouble for them to sell out cruises. I don't fear their debts cause there will always be a demand for cruising.

Regardless of vaccines, there’s still a ton of people out there saying F going on a cruise anytime soon. I wouldn’t doubt if they have challenges with hiring an stuff too. In addition to all that, there’s always the risk of a virus resurgence that tanks cruise lines again. Sell or take profits and diversify a bit."

2021-05-23 19:06:06,stocks,I agree - even if they do go up another 20% from these levels it will take longer and honestly I'm interested in higher returns (I know it's risky) because I'm not playing with a lot of money.

anecdotal evidence. These companies didn't become giants by accident. They offer an incredible service. I've spoken with people that do want to go to cruises. That is anecdotal evidence as well. But, I would bet there is more people that would love to go on a cruise today than those that don't."

2021-05-23 14:00:21,stocks,"Similar to above for me but it ith nclh. I've been selling covered calls at around $29 or $30 as an exit to try to get more premium. Because they're at the money can get a significant amount of premium but, I agree with you, the company's effectively at the same pre-covid market cap but is unquestionably worse off than before covid just based on the pure fact of delays and more debt now than before. Has been a strategy for me though to basically try to milk as much money as possible off it."

2021-05-23 15:43:44,stocks,"I didn’t read anything in squirrel’s post denying that there’s a lot of people waiting to cruise again. His point is that all the debt incurred has to be serviced and repaid, costs will be much higher, if only because of CDC requirements, and post pandemic valuation exceeds precpandemic valuation."
2021-05-23 16:38:39,stocks,"They’ll certainly see a temporary increase. But after the initial travel surge, I tend to think that demand for cruise ships will be lower than it was before. I have trouble adding cruises into the travel and entertainment demand at the moment."
2021-05-23 18:42:55,stocks,"While you’re probably right with your last statement, there is still sure as hell less people that want to go on a cruise today than there were a year and a half ago. People are simply worried about getting sick while stuck on a ship and or having a ship be quarantined for whatever reason. There will probably be some strong initial demand, just my opinion that that demand fades once people spend their savings on an initial trip."
2021-05-23 14:26:12,stocks,"Good for you selling covered calls - that's a great idea with these stocks, it is just so hard imagining them somehow going up another 10-20% more than their pre-pandemic market cap!"
2021-05-23 16:10:05,stocks,Completely agree.
2021-05-23 12:33:38,stocks,"Your first argument is based on anecdotal evidence and assumptions that are baseless “customers who are buying a $70k car are willing to spend another $10k” How do you know this?

More competition is good for the EV industry because that’s what drives innovation and development. Whether Tesla can compete with ICEs and more tech companies entering the EV industry is pretty hard to tell since all the other companies are still in its early stages. You’ll likely see more clearly by the time 2023 rolls around because that’s the timeline that almost every company put out as their expected release date. To be fair, you’ll likely receive more news about it in 2022 so it’ll be more likely to be clear by next year. 

Competition is good for the consumer and industry, but bad for individual companies. By bad, I mean companies typically dislike competition. If you control a monopoly, you’ll have no incentives to push you to innovate (/speed up innovation)."

2021-05-23 17:32:59,stocks,"I’m reading a bunch of rationalization that is moot when you consider Tesla’s financials. It’s way overpriced even if you believe they’re going to take over the energy and insurance industries (neither will happen in 10+ years if ever). 

They’re still a car company when a significant majority of their revenue comes from car sales. Auto manufacturing is a low margin and capital-intensive business and it shouldn’t be priced as if they’re ending world hunger. 

As of today, their P/E ratio is near equal to its stock price! Even if Elon fanboys’ wet dreams comes true and they’re the biggest company in the world in 10 years, they will no longer be priced as such."
2021-05-23 12:43:39,stocks,Completely agree...I own a Tesla Model S Plaid and tbh its cheaply made. The interior door panels are falling off and the screen is fucked. I also owned the reg model s before this and its quality was also severely lacking.

2021-05-23 11:55:20,stocks,Depends on the daily volume. Imagine that 50% of the daily volume was 1 guy buying/selling those shares. that will definately move the share price. Even to the point that you would be working against youself.

2021-05-23 12:02:17,stocks,Dataroma.com has a good list that's automatically updated with new 13f's
2021-05-23 12:41:31,stocks,"I do look at some, but I don’t think it’s necessarily helpful to base investment decisions off of them. You have to keep in mind that these filings are based on the past quarter, so you’ll always be 4 months behind them. 

As an example, some of my friends follow Warren Buffet’s filings and they scrambled into buying GOLD (Barrick Gold) the moment the news reports reported he was buying it - just because “WB never buys gold and now he is” only to find out in his next 13F filing that he was selling. So they essentially were buying at the time he was selling. 

The above is just an example of people I know that just blindly invest what these investors report, not shaming the company nor WB - I actually do like the company and bought it earlier this year after a thorough analysis. 

Main point is - it gives good insight on what their though process might be like, but you need to think of what the economy/ market was like during that quarter to find out why they were buying them."

2021-05-23 19:36:11,stocks,"I think ""smart money"" as a large group is not worth tracking. What I like to look for are specialists. If you are going to do this, you must align your investment period with how the managers invest. You also have to understand if the manager has different types of investment products that invest differently. For example, in biotech, Orbimed Advisors is one of the best in venture biotech. But positions can be in the hedge fund (shorter holding period) or the venture funds (longer holding period). For large, diversified asset managers like Fidelity and TRowe, the 13Fs are useless because they have index funds. You cannot take any real investment opinion away from quarter to quarter changes in holdings. 

It is also important to not just buy the largest holdings. With good managers, the largest holdings have grown into the largest positions through appreciation. You will want to track the new positions and see if the manager is adding to them over time. 

For what this forum is looking for, you want managers with one or two products that invest for the long-term like us. I like the following: 

Cantillon (growth), Kopernik (deep value), Whale Rock (tech), Pier 88 (small cap growth)"

2021-05-23 16:01:51,stocks,Even if you don’t trade options looking at the large bets that are made can help with the possible future direction of a stock. Obviously looking at its historic P/E range is first then looking at its growth and debt and finally options bets. Always good to get a complete picture before you buy. Plus it forces you not to make quick decisions but well thought out ones. There are a few you can pay money for that track them but if your just looking at a couple of stocks it’s not hard to do it yourself.

* They used the data at the time to decide what to buy, hold and sell
* They can leverage via options, low interest borrowing and of course dark pool trading.  Things you can't do.

2021-05-23 13:20:55,stocks,"It seems like you’re on the right path. I do similar things like you said analyzing the company, industry and competitors. 

I personally also do financial modelling to map out price targets a few years out (my targeted holding period). I won’t say they are accurate, but they give a rough estimate of what you can expect if the company meets your projections. 

I use multiples based on current and historical data and sometimes average them to get a final multiple as “base case” (assuming the multiples in the future will remain the same as multiples I calculated). Atm the multiples are usually on the higher side, so if there are high multiples, I might make an average excluding those years (2020/2021). 

Projected growth I usually use based on historical growth. If it’s not consistent, I look towards their annual reports, meetings, analyst projections and see if those align. I might gather these and then make my own projection on a more conservative rate ( better to be conservative imo). 

Current quarterly reports I usually update into my financial model to see if they are on track with my target and if not they’re adjusted. 

I do this with all the companies I own and in my watchlist. I also do this as a way to skim through companies to see if they might be worth investing if they are cheap. It takes a bit of work in the beginning, but if you can consolidate everything into 1 excel file to make a dashboard, you can keep a good eye on all your other excels and see if there are good opportunities during corrections. It might be a lot of work for some, but it’s something I like doing on my spare time. 

Just like to also note that what I do isn’t necessarily the “right way” to analyze a company. Analyzing a company and investing is more of an art than a science because there are so many ways to get a “good enough” answer to investment decisions."

2021-05-23 19:19:01,stocks,"I respectfully disagree. 
The real estate bubble is a part of strategy employed the Chinese government to keep money from outflowing to the US when the fed raises interest rates. If you are from Asia, you’d know firsthand how the US manipulates currency and strips countries of their economic progress every decade or so. This will remain as is so long as USD remain the world reserve currency.
Regarding China’s demographic problem, yes it is a concerning issue. But the US isn’t much better off too when you compare the fertility rates of the two countries.
Regarding incompetent politicians: I hope you take a good look at how the world handled the pandemic before judging governments and politicians in terms of competency. Also, China’s always had problems with corruption but that hasn’t deterred their progress. Career progression through the CCP ladder is based on true meritocracy, not through some sort of popular contest where presidency becomes the hobbies of billionaires."

2021-05-23 17:10:23,stocks,"How does that compare to margin per vehicle sold? My understanding is that a large component of the valuation difference is because Tesla sources everything themselves whereas the big auto manufacturers buy many components and even outsource production which means profit sharing. Also, the market potential of selling software updates in perpetuity to Tesla owners translates into that part of the business deserving a valuation consistent with other tech companies - scalable, high-margin business with lower capital requirements."

2021-05-23 00:00:00,stocks,"selling and buying back the same stock to reduce capital gains I made some good gains this year, but one of my stocks crashed really hard. I still believe in that stock, however I was thinking of selling it, and buying it back right away to reduce my capital gains. Is this common practice or legal?"
2021-05-23 10:36:42,stocks,"If you sell it for a loss and rebuy it within 30 days it is a wash sale, and you can’t claim those until you sell it again. All those losses will roll into you buying the new lot of that stock."

2021-05-23 10:44:18,stocks,"I was thinking of doing it the other way around. I've had a few investments that have not done well that I have closed out.  Others that I think will do well later on.  But I have some investments that I got into around March or April of last year, one that's almost three times the original investment, another that is about two and a half times the original investment. I thought of selling the ones that are doing well, and then repurchasing after 30 days, to balance out the capital loss I've had on other investments."
2021-05-23 10:56:39,stocks,This is a decision we usually make at the end of the year. Anything you want to cut loose you sell Dec.1st and don’t buy back till after 30days or sell it Dec.31st and wait 30 days. I’ve been trading full time for 12 years and I always do this. I basically sell Dec.1st and take the month off to enjoy the holidays.
2021-05-23 12:30:37,stocks,"You have to wait at least 30 days to buy it again if you want to use the losses in your taxes. Otherwise, you sold it for a loss and will not gain any benefit from it tax wise. 

People, understand short term gains and long term gains. Even if you reinvest the money in stocks, unlike real estate, you will pay taxes on them. Short term taxes will be higher than long term taxes (owning the stock for at least 1 year before selling it). Be very aware of this, cause it is all fun and games now, but come tax season, you could be looking at owing the federal government money that you may not have at hand.

EDIT: Let me add: first in-first out. So, if you purchased a stock and you sold it for a loss. Let's say you purchased 10 shares of KMB at 200 and it's now trading at 100. You held KMB for over a year, and they've have paid you dividends, and you reinvested the dividends in to the company. When you sell your shares of KMB, the ones your originally purchased will be counted against your long term gain taxes. The partial share purchased through dividends will be counted against your short term gain taxes. There's a $500 limit that you can claim on losses. If you have $700 in losses, you can use the $500 total this year and roll the $200 to next year's taxes. That's the most I am going to contribute to society for the year."
2021-05-23 12:08:04,stocks,"Question: Say I made a ton of profits this year on one trade, like 700% my account value, but have now given back like 500% on a position I’m still holding and would like to continue holding long term. I basically can’t afford to pay taxes on the 700% gain without locking in the 500% loss. Assuming no further appreciation in current position till end of the year, can I sell December 31 and rebuy on January 1 2022 so my 2021 profit is only 200%? Or would I still be taxed at 700% if I repurchased the position January 1?"
2021-05-23 16:52:24,stocks,"If you sell the whole position and buy it back within 30 days, the wash sale rule prevents you from taking any of the loss. 

There's really no way around this except to wait the 30 days to buy back. 

And no, buying a new position first, then selling the old one doesn't get around the wash sale rule. Its 30 days on either end of the sale. So if you buy 30 days before or 30 days after, it triggers it."
2021-05-23 10:39:24,stocks,I have no official advice to give but I have heard this is not good. Not sure if this is in a tax free or tax sheltered/deferred account and what that would change. But if not then I think there is some rule that exemption for losses would not be allowed if you repurchased the same stock within a certain time frame after a loss. Maybe look into that rule or ask about it. It might be referred to as a wash sale. Not sure if it would be okay if you bought something else.

2021-05-23 14:16:26,stocks,"What happens in this situation: I buy one share of a stock at $100. It drops to $50. I buy a second share at $50. Then I sell a share at $50. Is my loss considered to be $50 (first in, first out), or does it average the cost to $75, making my loss $25 while I retain one share? Or is it last in, first out, so there's no loss recorded at all?"
2021-05-23 19:58:04,stocks,"if you sell it, and wait until it drops, then it makes sense, but selling right away to rebuy makes zero sense. even without wash sales, where would you be gaining an advantage? youd have a paper loss, but it would offset any gains, same as a wash sale."

2021-05-23 15:53:26,stocks,"Rather than hypothesize various scenarios you should refer to your cost basis.  You'll be taxed on that value.   

As I understand it, each time you buy or sell a security you reset the 30 day clock on that security - the losses are rolled into the cost of your next purchase (each time you buy back in) until they are covered by your most recent sell of that security.  (feel free to correct me if I'm wrong)"

Sell it for a loss and then buy the next day and keep it will it grows. It'd be an insane tax hack. Honestly, the FEDS should make it 90 days without repurchasing it if they don't want people to be trying to manipulate their taxes. For now, 30 days? Great deal, I think."

2021-05-23 15:42:35,stocks,"Yes, if it’s the same stock within 30 calendar days (calendar year does not matter).

If it’s an ETF or MF, it’s considered a wash sale if you buy back into something that is considered to be a “substantially identical security” but that definition is loosely defined and rather easy to avoid. 

See [here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/substantiallyidenticalsecurity.asp) for a couple examples such as selling SPY for a loss (tax harvest) then immediately buying into VOO – the ETFs are essentially identical for investing (S&P 500 index funds) yet considered different enough to avoid a wash sale and can be used for tax harvesting (a bit of a loop hole for now).

Note: this is not professional, investing, or tax advice, it's just something for interesting reading."
2021-05-23 16:42:25,stocks,"You are correct.  You'd be taxed on the $1,000 not the $8,000.

I thought, shit this is good news. If it happens, great, if not oh well… so I quickly bought a $20 strike for the following day. 

Realizing the news would be better the following week, I bought a 2nd option at $20 for May 28. 

The first was executed because E*TRADE automatically executes a contract if you’re in the money at close, which I was. So that was kind of dumb luck.

This makes or breaks your whole argument. YouTube is filled with self proclaimed influencers ""teaching"" options and DD without even passing third grade maths. YouTube is *as bad as tiktok for knowledge* since you got no idea who's legit, you'll get recommendations based on who's *popular* not who's smart.



Compare to a book in a library. If you go to the economics sections you'll find *knowledge*. Each book has to be accepted and publishes which weeds out the worst, further more the writer and their skillet is usually presented. Old books only renin on shelf if they have *solid information* otherwise they get replaced. In a library you'll never look for ""option trading for beginners"" and find a book written by Pussy_Slayer88, but you'll find him on YouTube with millions of views. Millions who took his word for truth and ""learnt"" from a charlatan.



Tdlr: If you have knowledge you can weed out bad YouTubers, an amateur has no way to do it. They'll fall for flashy intros and charismatic personality, not knowledge (Warren Buffert is boring, but knowledgeable. PewDiePie/Pokimane are fun rathe then knowledgeable)"

2021-05-23 17:25:42,stocks,Meh. I wouldn't discourage anyone from learning options trading on YouTube. Maybe tell them to stick to tastytrade's YouTube videos until they have a firm grasp on the basics
2021-05-23 19:21:58,stocks,"I do 100% agree with you. But the whole sentiment of ""you cant learn anything from YouTube"" is wrong. Don't use YouTube as your only source of knowledge but rather one of many. Gather information from the internet, books, your peers, and your elders in order to form your own opinions"
2021-05-23 15:20:57,stocks,"well, we make money off the people that aren't educated...so I'm happy all these newbies are entering the game. I actually find it funny how people on reddit actually share their trading ideas. It's not my goal to help you make money...so why would I be honest\\truthful with anyone. (Same applies to youtbers\\influencers...they want people to think its easy, so they and others can make money off them.)"
2021-05-23 12:44:46,stocks,"For a beginner, there’s no way to tell the difference between someone who knows their shit about investing, and someone who is just a good YouTuber. YouTube (and all self-learning really) is best navigated by someone who already understands the basics, or is looking for a very specific explanation. 

That’s not to say you can’t find good resources for beginners on YouTube, because you definitely can. You just won’t necessarily KNOW if it’s good info or WSB YOLO shit unless someone helps you choose the right source."

2021-05-23 14:30:35,stocks,"I see where it can go wrong. But anyone who is gonna care about their money won't take some random guys word for it. You can get a basic understanding from youtube videos. At the very least, it's a good start."
2021-05-23 13:05:24,stocks,"Anyone who's been around for more then a year know its the polar opposite, $ROPE and loss porn used to be common for good reasons.



There is one verified millionaire on WSB and that's DFV. When he posted his DD he was *ridiculed* and mocked by the community, no one believed him. Once he was rich then people changed their tune, not before. WSB didn't believe him, his DD got downvoted. The shit that actually gets high, from silver to oil tankers, from grout features to Purple, has lost people millions. People have comited suicide due to bad deals following ""DD"".



If you're lucky, buy a scratch ticket and win due to luck. If you're skilled, work in finance and get rich. If you're neither, use bogleheads and rely on the *statistically proven way to get rich*. Without skill, or luck, you'll never know solid DD from shit."

I keep reading posts saying the one coming is going to make 2008 look like child’s play. I have all my life savings, around $170,000 invested and granted I don’t know jack about investing, I have been trying to learn more. I have thought about selling and putting it it all in my savings for the time being, but on the other hand I feel like that’s just a dumb move. I’m losing sleep over it. Any advice would be greatly appreciated."
2021-05-23 10:19:36,stocks,"Just make sure you have cash on the side to live off if there is a cash. Many like to say have 6 months worth of salary in your savings account to live off.

2021-05-23 10:19:23,stocks,Were u invested before pandemic? That was a crash and u survived. If u r losing sleep u need to take ur money out of stocks and put it in a bank.

2. Trust your own judgment.
3. Ignore noise, figure out what truly matters.

2021-05-23 11:02:43,stocks,"Always always always leave some assets liquid.

As far as a crash goes (I've invested thorough a few one major and some minor) You can only really loose if you sell in the red so the best position to bet on is one where you can sit on your hands and wait."

2021-05-23 13:16:42,stocks,"There's a lot of money to make on keeping people clicking on sensational title. You can see CNBC rotating the bulls and the bears according to what the market was doing on that particular day so that bulls and bears can say ""I told you!."" 

I will tell you an open secret: no one knows what's gonna happen, least of all the media entertainment. What they neglect to tell you, because it does not make good tv, when they talk about the potential crash is the opportunity cost lost to you if you miss out on a run up if the crash never comes. And it gets increasingly more difficult the longer you stay out of the market to get back in, I have friends who sold around May 2020 and have still not got back in because, if you're married to a crash thesis, a 4100 point SP 500 looks a lot more scary than one with 2700 point."
2021-05-23 12:20:41,stocks,"In the 20th century, the United States endured two world wars and other traumatic and expensive military conflicts; the Depression; a dozen or so recessions and financial panics; oil shocks; a flu epidemic; and the resignation of a disgraced president. Yet the Dow rose from 66 to 11,497. Now in the 21st century, we've endured another attack on America, two wars, a financial crisis which led to the Great Recession, protests ranging from occupy  Wall Street to police brutality, The most divisive president in US history which led to an attack on the American capital...by ""Americans"", and is currently at the tail end of a near 2 year pandemic. And yet, the Dow continued to climb from 11,497 to 34,207. 

Simply put: Don't bet against America. A crash is simply a sale. Think long term."

5 years after 2008"
2021-05-23 10:20:30,stocks,"You invested for a reason. However, never invest all of your money, keep some liquidity on the side. Remember, you don’t suffer material losses until you sale. Don’t worry about it, take out your investments if you feel uncomfortable. It’s not worth the stress. On the other hand, if things go up you will be like dang I missed out. It depends on your risk appetite and tolerance. Also, if you believe in what you are investing in. Hang in there and make the best decision based on your situation."

Apply research, make sure beyond any doubt that the stock you are investing in, isnt over-valued and will grow into the future."
2021-05-23 11:02:39,stocks,Don’t worry about a crash just protect your money when we have parabolic moves like this. Stay away from speculative investments and either keep a large cash position or learn about options and buy long Calls on the VIX. Other than that I wouldn’t worry. I’ve seen many “ corrections “ in the 12 years I’ve traded full time and some like 2018 took almost 2 years to recover but it always does.
2021-05-23 12:02:17,stocks,Just buy some shares over time
2021-05-23 12:08:31,stocks,"Ignore the media they are infotainment only.

If you are risk adverse then split your portfolio between stocks and high grade bonds. If the market looks to you to be over extended go 75% government/municipal or high grade bonds. Then if the market corrects you can rebalance to more of a stock weighting."

2021-05-23 15:50:35,stocks,"You always have to have cash on hand man. The market will also always be back, and stronger. You just need to wait. If you do not have enough to survive a couple years, pull some out maybe. Man I would love a huge crash. I didn't have the funds in March at all. I will buy everything when we find the bottom."
2021-05-23 16:00:53,stocks,"If all your investments lost 50% of their value tomorrow, would that be intolerable? If so, you are over allocated in the market and should pull out enough for a safety cushion (6m of all expenses should do it)"

2021-05-23 17:38:41,stocks,Take out $70k and put it in the bank for when the market crashes.  I heard it may crash in 2 weeks down 70% or something!
2021-05-23 10:43:19,stocks,"If you are worried, you can go all cash on a savings account. In six months or a year you can re-enter the market when either the crash happened or the situation stabilized to the point where you are comfortable re-investing. Or you can go all bonds to still reap some profit.  Or you can ask your financial advisor to build an extremely defensive portfolio for you. 

Plot twist: I sold everything in February and waiting in cash (USD and EUR) and gold for the market crash to be able to hawk in on the sweet discounted shares."
2021-05-23 11:55:04,stocks,"if you're losing sleep, begin selling.  I have about 8% of my wealth in stocks."
2021-05-23 12:10:29,stocks,And moved the date of the end of days every year accurately to the next year!
2021-05-23 10:57:44,stocks,"Liquidating 50% wouldn't really be a great idea, considering that its buying power devalues by about 3% each year to inflation. Assuming they have their money invested in an index fund, the best thing they can probably do is take a history lesson and/or delete their brokerage account. We've recovered from every crash to date, and I highly doubt that will ever change."
2021-05-23 12:04:00,stocks,"Agreed. You need to know whos got your money. If you have conviction in your holdings that will help immensely. 

Take pepsi for example. if you are going to convince store grabbing a pepsi and lays every day, then if the stock crashed you will laugh it off because you know the product rocks."
2021-05-23 10:21:49,stocks,"Well I figured letting someone who’s job it is is to invest money, invest my money, while at the same time I try to learn more about investing was a better idea than just keeping it in a bank account making absolutely nothing on it...but thanks anyway"
2021-05-23 11:54:39,stocks,"Oh I am paying a professional to invest for me. Im certainly an idiot, just not a complete idiot lol"
2021-05-23 18:55:23,stocks,"I invested $250k and I know nothing either . I feel professionals are over rated , they sell high fee products . My strategy is simple , invest in VTI 80% and believe in America. VUG for some growth 15% ( though lot of overlap with VTI) and 5% in VO. If recession comes , depression , another pandemic or whatever 3-4 yrs I will be safe again . It’s America man , it will innovate and survive. ETF’s are lazy investments and many a times they will beat the so called professionals easily"
2021-05-23 18:01:08,stocks,“When we find the bottom”...we all wish it was that easy :) the true bottom is only obvious in hindsight. I too will want to buy everything at the bottom ! Crossing fingerz
2021-05-23 11:00:36,stocks,"This is an aweful idea. They're in it for the long run. If they're worried about losing money on an index fund, imagine how worried they'd be seeing them puts go red if nothing happens. There's a time frame you have to choose and the farther you push that time out, the more premium you have to pay"
2021-05-23 11:01:17,stocks,Many sold last March and then missed the recovery waiting for the bottom.  Don’t try to time the market.
2021-05-23 11:24:54,stocks,"Yea I said sleep better, not it’s the best idea."
2021-05-23 12:57:42,stocks,Is there any low yielding safe things to invest in? Most high yield savings I’ve looked at only provide .5% or less and like you said it would devalue 3% every year.
2021-05-23 10:30:30,stocks,"Same boat, except I plan on keeping my life savings/retirement money with the experts in diversified funds and play around with/learn with money I would otherwise spend.  This makes me worry less about a crash because I think of my life savings as for when I need it  25 years from now at age 70. I reason the market is well beyond operating with fundamentals in mind so what am I going to actually learn anyway, and rich people who manage large funds know how to protect the wealthy from total destruction."
2021-05-23 10:42:13,stocks,"This is fine. I won’t pretend to know how much research you did picking those experts. If it wasn’t much maybe take another look around and see if a “Bogle Three Fund” “Dave Ramsey Four Fund” or just SP500 is right for you. 

Often these experts take about 1% per year and there are frequently stories of people being sold complicated products that were only recommended due to a higher fee. 

If you start looking into the advice from some of the world most successful investors you’ll start to see a pattern of them recommending very simple investment strategies that track with the market vs. trying to beat the market. 

Your concern about crashes is well founded. We are at an unprecedented high. Do you need that money in the next 3-6 years? If so you should sell and go to cash or some alternative. If you can let the money stay and it’s more for retirement, then leave it there, a crash will come, when a crash comes NEVER SELL AT A LOSS, after a few years the price will stabilize again. You also need to be DCA dollar cost averaging into the ups and downs, so that yea you’ve invested in only up trend for a while, but you’ll now be investing in only down trend, don’t be scared off. All you’re doing is lowering your average cost per share."
2021-05-23 17:41:23,stocks,Just put it all in VTI.  I'd keep maybe 50% in money market.
2021-05-23 12:23:42,stocks,I'm glad of that lol
2021-05-23 19:14:28,stocks,Sounds like you know a bit there to be fair and in that instance I too would not give money over to a professional. You've a good strategy there my man
2021-05-23 11:57:52,stocks,Yupp. Timing is everything
2021-05-23 11:28:19,stocks,Many kept on holding their stocks in 2000 and watched as their investments evaporated into nothing.
2021-05-23 13:29:21,stocks,"You can invest in safer vehicles, like AAA/AA Municipal Bonds, etc. I don't know what they're paying right now but a few years ago those were paying interest of 4-5% with 5-20 year repayment."
2021-05-23 13:57:27,stocks,"TIPS are the only good protection against inflation. Don't fall into the belief that Gold and Silver are good hedges, because the reality is that they're not as good as many proclaim."
2021-05-23 11:33:49,stocks,"Many?  If you are talking about those that bought single stocks in the dot com bubble, then sure.  For those invested in index funds like s&p 500 for example, they recovered and have been rewarded handsomely from this 10 year bull market."
2021-05-23 13:34:00,stocks,Does that mean your money is tied up that long? That wouldn’t be liquid enough
2021-05-23 16:10:58,stocks,And they only had to wait thirteen years to start to see those handsome rewards.
2021-05-23 13:35:56,stocks,"Correct:  


It is relatively low risk (you can get higher risk municipal bonds) but pay more than a CD, Bond, Savings, Money Market, etc. I wouldn't use it is as a primary investment vehicle at all but if you want some very safe growth that is the best option I know."

2021-05-23 00:00:00,stocks,"Question: How do Triple leveraged ETFs lose money? I was reading an article, [https://www.thebalance.com/leveraged-etfs-lose-money-357489](https://www.thebalance.com/leveraged-etfs-lose-money-357489), and it basically explains that holding things like TQQQ always lose money over the long term, but if I look at it's graph, well you can see it has profited, I know this isn't how it works, and I know i'm missing something, can someone explain to me like i'm 5 how this works? 

&#x200B;

I did read the article but it wasn't really helpful, and claimed rebalancing was the reason I believe? but i'm confused how that hurts the value."
2021-05-23 15:52:11,stocks,"Firstly, there are fees associated with the leverage these etfs provide.

Secondly, volatility is killing them. Let's look at an example. 
Let's say the underlying is in a very volatile phase. It is going from $100 to $90 in a day. That's a 10% drop. The ETF will tripple it and fall 30% to $70.

The very next day the underlying will completely recover and go back to $100. That's a 11.1% gain. The ETF will tripple that again and gain 33.3%. But 1.333*$70 is not $100, but $93.33

While the underlying is exactly where it started, the ETF is still 6.6% in the hole.

A real life example would be QQQ and TQQQ durring the corona crash. QQQ made a new ATH on the 3rd of june 2020. At the same time TQQQ was still 28% below it's own ATH."
2021-05-23 12:23:15,stocks,"It's not a cut and dry issue, there are instances of people making money long-term with leveraged ETFs.

2021-05-23 09:42:51,stocks,Leveraged ETF must rebalance on a daily bases.  Buy/Sell this causes a small loss each time.   The QQQ has been going up TQQQ has been ok.  Must other leveraged funds have been losing over time.  These funds are designed for a short term play.
2021-05-23 10:29:53,stocks,"Check out this article with a short math example that explains how leveraged ETFs may lose money; [https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/know-what-youre-buying%3A-leveraged-and-inverse-funds-2020-05-11](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/know-what-youre-buying%3A-leveraged-and-inverse-funds-2020-05-11)

Basically if an index is negative over a period a 3x leveraged fund could lose more than 3x over the same timeframe.

[This article from the SEC](https://www.sec.gov/files/DERA_LETF_Economics_Note_Nov2019.pdf) puts it another way and shows how the risk profile of these leveraged ETFs is basically the same as buying options. Not saying options are evil, but you (presumably) wouldn't fill up your portfolio with options and treat it as a set and forget investment like a standard index tracking ETF, right?

Remember that our markets have been on a tear since \~2009 thanks to QE, so the 10yr performance of a 3X leveraged fund can look deceptively consistent. Also, most of these leveraged funds haven't existed before that time so there's little hard data on the losses they can incur during a bear market."

2021-05-23 09:48:27,stocks,">Question: How do Triple leveraged ETFs lose money?

They don't. It's all just a weird scare tactic that spread like a wildfire. People think they're smart when they find out about volatility drag, but it's only one small factor of a leveraged ETF.

There are risks to holding TQQQ shares, but volatility drag is negligible. Read the prospectus to get a list of risks. The one I'd be the most afraid of is a liquidity problem where the banks might not be able to fulfill their side of the swaps they sell to proshares."
2021-05-23 15:48:30,stocks,Look at the 5 year on TQQQ it’s up over 1000%

This video has a good explanation."
2021-05-23 08:38:40,stocks,"It’s due to those ETFs using options and other derivatives to mimic triple leverage. Over time decay will eat away at your bottom line.

TQQQ is a bit of an anomaly because the nasdaq has performed so strongly since TQQQ inception that it’s been an ok asset to hold long term. 

Look at SQQQ if you want to see what decay does over time. Last year’s covid crash is barely a blip in the 5 year chart.

Edit: comparing VIX to UVXY (leveraged) is probably better. VIX remains relatively level while UVXY has plummeted infinitely since its inception"
2021-05-23 11:39:58,stocks,"http://www.ddnum.com/articles/leveragedETFs.php

A bit long but a very good read. Around 2x leverage is the optimal IIRC."
2021-05-23 09:58:03,stocks,3x faster Than 1x funds?
2021-05-23 15:20:22,stocks,"Som there are 2 ways to leverage

1. either you borrow from banks and invest 3x (yearly returns also are 3x - interest cost). Either you make 3x money or face margin calls or end up owning money to bank if assets decline significantly.  
Too risky but they amplify 3x annual, daily and monthly returns and annual returns

2. TQQQ only 3x your daily return on nasdaq.
So instead of owning the money to bank to 3x your returns, etf buy derivatives to replicate 3x daily returns. 
This means your monthly and yearly return don't amplify 3x, only daily returns do without owning additional money from the bank."
2021-05-23 14:07:52,stocks,Stocks never go down
2021-05-23 15:11:00,stocks,"easy but extreme case: 

underlying asset loses 33% and then gains 50%, its now at -> (100 - 33)*1.5 = 100.5

3x leverage etf therefore loses 99% and gains 150%, its at -> (100-99)*2.5 = 2.5

this is called volatility decay"
2021-05-23 15:26:57,stocks,"Simplest way I can put it: if you invest $1, then lose 10% (value: $0.9), then make 10% (value: $0.99) you have less than the original investment. That’s the effect at its core."
2021-05-23 16:57:05,stocks,Main thing is a 5% gain isn't the same thing as a 5% loss. Now triple it bc of leverage.
2021-05-23 17:15:22,stocks,"Fees are much higher.

Loss of 1% requires a gain of 1.01% to get back to your starting balance.

Loss of 3% requires a gain of 3.09% to get back to your starting balance.

Stack losses like this one on top of the other and hopefully you can see why that can be bad.

Liquidity of some leveraged ETFs can be a problem when trading. But not *super* serious when holding long term. i.e. no Paper hands. If your plan is to hold long term. Hold.

The volatility decay many are siting magnifies losses in a bear market, but it also magnifies gains in a bull market (beyond the leveraged amount).

Checkout [Hedgefundie's Excellent Adventure](https://www.optimizedportfolio.com/hedgefundie-adventure/) for a more in-depth look.

If used intelligently, and with some serious diamond hands, they can lead to staggering long term gains. That's not to say you won't get staggering long term losses either though.

Do your DD. Leverage of any kind is not to be taken lightly."
2021-05-23 17:17:57,stocks,"Check the changes in 2X funds vs 3X funds and you'll kind of see what they mean. 3X is dominated by wild swings, so it's harder to see. Also look at how much money they lose being on the wrong side. TQQQ lost almost 3 years of its gains during March 2020 vs QQQ which lost ~1.5 years"

2021-05-23 17:39:42,stocks,Shouldn’t the etf be at 300 to start (ie also tripled) because then a 10% loss gets you to 270 at a 11.1% gains get you back to 300.
2021-05-23 10:09:43,stocks,"yeah i don't have a comprehensive answer but i have had the same question a while back and this is my take on it:

As others have stated there's really no reason to see volatility decay as a major risk to leveraged long etfs in an uptrend. In a downtrend you're gonna lose regardless. But there's not just TQQQ. Check out FAS or any other long leveraged etf to get a better picture.

Leveraged Inverse etfs decay at such a rate because index funds have a natural upwards drift and because a poitive % return > % Loss is required to recover from drawdowns.

With that being said i'm gonna buy some JNUG on monday."
2021-05-23 14:31:52,stocks,"^ this. 

My first investments were IJR, UPRO and MVV. I started investing in September 2011. Had I not listened to others and kept my MVV and UPRO, life would have been much better for me today. But I listened to “wise” advice and sold UPRO and MVV on 30-40% gains each."

2021-05-23 13:47:50,stocks,"This is so wrong. While TQQQ has a higher expense ratio and does not actually return perfectly 3x returns every day it gets close to it. 

Volatility drag affects all instruments. Assuming a normal ticker with 1x leverage such as QQQ has a 3% loss it needs about a 3.4% gain to fully recover from the loss. This drag is further pronounced with TQQQ as a larger loss needs an even larger gain to recover from. This isn't just a downside though as consistent daily positive returns will have a larger than 3x total return.

Assume QQQ starts at 100 and has two 3% days in a row 

QQQ would return $106.09 for a 6.09% return while TQQQ would return $118.81 for a 18.81% gain which is greater than 3x6.09. 

In addition TQQQ primarily used total return swaps which do not have time decay but have a fixed fee associated with them. The fund does have a high expense ratio at .95 but it pretty consistentently meets the fund objective of daily 3x returns and should be treated as performing as such but with the extra risk that it might not in certain environments.

UVXY does invest in contracts with time decay but this is more of a result of trading a VIX derivative which perform differently than normal funds."
2021-05-23 11:13:24,stocks,"UVXY tracks VIX futures though, which themselves decay. So the decay in UVXY relative to VIX isn't just due to UVXY being leveraged."

If its 300 for the triple leveraged, why the hell would a 10% drop in the underlying bring it to 270? thats your mistake. It would bringt it to 210. You literally forgot the leverage. Its a 30% drop.

If this unfortunate chain of events still unravels, the fund will be forced to cover outstanding swaps at the moment when their negative value is close to the ETF net assets value, analogous to margin call.

2021-05-23 19:14:27,stocks,40-50% SPY crash? Has this ever happened aside from 1932?
2021-05-23 11:44:14,stocks,It looks like you want to give your money to the wall street.
2021-05-23 09:21:24,stocks,"Think of it like insurance. Insurance allows you to buy or repair after a loss. Do you want to insure the whole potential loss or would you be ok with insuring half or whatever?

Look at strikes - premiums. What combinations payoff the amount of loss you want covered? 

You’re more likely to lose the premium just like with other insurance. So how much is your peace of mind worth? Is this strategy going to prevent you from selling at the bottom? How much is this psychological crutch worth?"

2021-05-23 08:06:47,stocks,"What you are looking for here is a strike that would offset your losses. Let’s say the market is at 200 sometime before next year but you don’t know when then you would buy a leap. The amount of money you make if the spy corrects to say $200 (seems extremely unlikely) would depend on the premium you pay. If you buy a 3/22 405p right now the premium is $25 so if you hit 200 that premium now becomes 405 - 200 = 205. So you have almost 10x a return there. You make a better return the more OTM your put is. 

The percentage you would allocate here is fully dependent on the size of your portfolio. You should also know on average tail hedge provides a bad return."

2021-05-23 10:44:23,stocks,"I have been tracking the cost of buying ATM index puts of different durations, with the initial plan being to roll quarterly to reflect the new index value. This kind of (almost) 100% protection was far more than I can bear. Now I am looking into 0.3 delta puts, which (I think) would protect only against black swan crashes.

The approach for calculating the number of puts needed to protect your  capital, cash needed to buy index puts, and profits/losses from index changes (when rolling) can easily be found on investopedia."

I guessyou  could do 1% of portfolio in deep OTM puts so you have a tonne on convexity in the next 50%crash but who knows when that'll be"

Sure, Paysafe is currently not profitable right now; but if Bill Foley manages to do 1/10th of the job he did at Fidelity National, PSFE should be worth more than 8.6B $, no?

Given Bill Foleys track record at Fidelity National and D&B of downsizing costs and multiplying profit margins it seems very tempting to buy more shares/warrants but I’d love some more input regarding the potential downsides to PSFE (besides it’s lackluster performance the last 15/20 years).

2021-05-23 00:00:00,stocks,"Has Elon changed his mind about lidar? Tesla is on the road apparently testing Lidar sensors on its cars.

“Because of operational limits and cost inefficiencies”... care to elaborate?"
2021-05-23 05:37:22,stocks,"Unfortunately for Elon, it’s the only solution that can actually get anywhere near full self driving"
2021-05-23 08:10:40,stocks,"LIDAR is ***very*** good at measuring physical distances accurately in good weather, in settings where cost & energy efficiency are not primary constraints.

This is why SpaceX is using LIDAR when the Dragon spacecraft approaches the ISS & docks, 100% autonomously.

Tesla uses LIDAR to calibrate their camera based pseudo-stereoscopic distance measurements with LIDAR measurements.

The various disadvantages of LIDAR  are not a problem in such calibration runs:

- **High LIDAR unit cost:** not a problem, because there are only a few calibration units.
- **Poor LIDAR performance in rain & snow:** not a problem, as the calibration runs are done in good weather.
- **Interference of many LIDAR units:** since they'll never scale this up, there's no interference in practice.
- **Health risks of LIDAR:** they don't need high power LIDAR, nor are there multiple vehicles for the LIDAR laser beams to add up & cause eye or equipment damage.
- **High mapping & map maintenance costs of 3D HD LIDAR maps**: not a problem, because Tesla is not using HD 3D maps at all - they compare LIDAR return to the neural network stack distance estimates to calibrate.
- **Poor ability of LIDAR to distinguish between surfaces, detect curbs, etc.**: not a problem either, because if Tesla's camera FSD system is calibrated for large objects that LIDAR sees well, it works for small objects and surface features as well.
- **Necessity of LIDAR units to be mounted high at the top of the vehicle to maximize angular resolution & object detection - hurting aerodynamic profile & efficiency:** not a problem, as the energy efficiency of R&D cars is immaterial.

Tesla basically uses these high-end LIDAR units - probably the highest quality ones money can buy - to establish an independent ""ground truth"" to validate their own camera + neural network ASIC based 3D object recognition & tracking technologies.

Basically all of the disadvantages of LIDAR go away in an R&D setup - which is why such a mind-blowingly high percentage of autonomous vehicles startups got caught in the ""LIDAR trap"" - involuntarily conceding the FSD/autonomy mass market to Tesla."
2021-05-23 06:07:42,stocks,Lidar isnt true Fsd its just robot following programmed lines in mapped area. Your put that car in the middle od nowhere and it wont even be able to drive straight.
2021-05-23 17:02:16,stocks,"Exactly where do you see ""FSD/autonomy mass market"" as such, let alone it being conceded to Tesla?"
2021-05-23 06:10:15,stocks,The only systems under development that have actually achieved autonomous driving are Lidar systems.
2021-05-23 06:40:25,stocks,"That's true - just like there wasn't a mainstream, user-friendly smartphone without a keyboard, until Apple created the iPhone."
2021-05-23 06:42:32,stocks,"And that will be a fine argument if Tesla ever actually delivers an autonomous vehicle, but so far, they haven't, while their competitors are way ahead"
2021-05-23 07:02:41,stocks,"How are they “way ahead”? Who is they? And define “way ahead”? Genuinely curious. I am a shareholder of TSLA but afaik, TSLA has the most real world data for autonomous driving, almost millions of more miles more than the next competitor which is Waymo. And Waymo lost a few key executives in the past few months."
2021-05-23 07:24:47,stocks,"Not exactly, rather than true autonomy, the competitors are basically building out park rides that have to ""follow"" specific ""tracks"" (mapped out roads and drivable areas) that locks them into a single area. Since they only follow the tracks it's an easier problem to solve computationally. 

Eventually, the competitors will be able to map out everything, but there's a finite limit to how quickly they can do so, and there are a lot more roads that can be mapped out. The competitors will do well as long as the driver's stay within the park, but it'll be quite dangerous to go outside of it.

Tesla seeks to be able to drive pretty much anywhere. This is a much harder problem computationally and will take longer to solve. So it certainly does come down to which solves which first.

I live in a fairly rural area, I would be very surprised if any Tesla competitor becomes located in my area within the decade, as they will be focusing on cities, so they will likely become available in every city, then start mapping smaller and smaller towns before they have full coverage. Perhaps they can do something like Tesla and put mapping systems into the cars that are already driving and thus speed up the process. But in the end, the scaling problem isn't something that can be quickly resolved, though the issues on Tesla's side are certainly not trivial either, though they don't have any scaling issue. They are already operating at scale, they just need to get the software (and perhaps hardware) working as well as they would like. That is just a matter of continuous improvement.

Overall, I believe I'll see a Tesla robotaxi in use in my area before I see a non-Tesla robotaxi, though I'm certainly hard pressed to say whether it'll be a few months from now or a few years from now, though I think it is likely to be 2-5 years, mostly for regulatory reasons. Even when it is considered truly FSD, it will require probably at least a few months of data to act as evidence that it truly is better than a human before it get's regulatory approval.

And yet there are people going around acting like Tesla has already finished making a fully autonomous vehicle, completely ignoring that even Tesla admits their system is still level 2, and is explicitly not autonomous.

All the evidence points to Tesla being far behind and their technology being incapable of safely driving autonomously.

The reason I don't think the technology works is because I'm familiar with the limitations of computer vision. It is appropriate for snapchat filters and object detection in non-critical applications. It is completely inappropriate for real time autonomous driving, where failure to detect an object (which happens all the time) can result in death."
2021-05-23 10:15:09,stocks,I’m sure you feel this way and I’m sure you are very bright but if you understood the technology better than Tesla engineers you wouldn’t be commenting on a Reddit post but working on fsd technology yourself. Agree to disagree
2021-05-23 10:18:35,stocks,"What the fuck kind of logic is that?

I don't have to work on FSD technology myself to know that the current state of the art in computer vision, and specifically Tesla's implementation, falls short of all the necessary requirements to safely operate a vehicle, primarily, it has to be able to detect objects immediately in front of the vehicle, which the Tesla self driving computer vision system is demonstrably unable to do consistently, as per demonstration videos posted by real users. All computer vision systems are unable to do this to the consistency that is required to safely operate a motor vehicle."
2021-05-23 10:32:29,stocks,"Well I think the logic is perfectly fair, you seem to claim to be smarter than every engineer at Tesla, which based on that last response and this claim makes me feel that you are no more than a narcissistic asshole. Vision will be safer than any human operated vehicle, Tesla will solve autonomy and will continue to have the safest vehicles on the road. You seem to think you know everything about learning but seem to be missing the point that data is extremely important which Tesla has a massive lead in. Tesla bears are always so immature..🤦🏻‍♂️"

You can see the current state of the vision system on the panel - where the car is, what objects the system is aware of etc.

You can see that when the other car passes in this incident, the system is completely unaware of it until \*after\* it has practically already passed! Despite the car being clearly visible!

A Lidar system would not have done this - since it can accurately range objects without having to derive spatial information from non-spatial data."
2021-05-23 11:11:24,stocks,"Watching through that video was definitely concerning, points to add. The driver is very quick to take over and not allowing the car to fully make decisions, that being said when the car was passing in front the driver was right to take over as that could have been messy. At the same time this is also one of the worst “close calls” videos I’ve seen where the car continues to make mistakes much more often than I’ve seen in the past and the driver really does not give the car a chance to correct itself as he takes over control way to quickly. Either way I can understand where you are coming from in saying the car is incapable of driving safely, as more data is collected and more competent beta testers allow the vehicle to drive I believe it will continue to improve. Thanks for sharing"
2021-05-23 11:15:49,stocks,"Also regardless of all this you still seem to be claiming that the LIDAR systems are self driving, yes they are better when dropped in a sandbox and told exactly where to go. But that’s where it ends, non of them can do what this Tesla in the video is doing. This video shows a car trying to navigate a busy city, it does not do very well obviously, but no other car can do this without the route being spoon fed to them. This is where Tesla will win."
2021-05-23 11:22:42,stocks,"The problem is that it's fundamentally flawed to try and do this using computer vision. You simply cannot reliably take a 2D image and extract spatial information from it, because that information isn't there in the first place. You can throw all the data and AI in the world at it, but all you're doing is *guessing* what the car is seeing.

These guesses can be very good and it can work very well a lot of the time. But when it's in a car, it has to work *all the time,* because if you guess wrong, the passenger is dead. A car needs to be certain of what is around it. We have the technology available to do that reliably, it's called Lidar. A system that guesses is not an improvement on that."
2021-05-23 11:29:19,stocks,"They *are* self driving, even if they can't self drive anywhere in the world. What Waymo has realised is the idea of a self driving car using AI that can drive anywhere at all is simply not possible. They are being sensible and developing a car that drives where most people want to drive, because that is possible.

What Tesla is doing so far is self driving a car dangerously. This is not very impressive. I will always prefer a car that safely drives me to 99% of the places I want to go over the car that will take me down dirt roads but might kill me in the process."
2021-05-23 19:02:22,stocks,"Valid points, but a human has the same issues. A human is roughly guessing the distance, but we can work around that most of the time (optical illusions being the exception) via stereovision.

Also tesla does use stereovision as humans do, so they should be able perceive depth about as well as a human can in theory. So it's not using just a single 2D image (which indeed has little depth information), as you seem to be implying.  


If anyone else really wants to clear about how FSD really likely works, here is an interview with an AI expert discussing it:  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHskNXI37yg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHskNXI37yg)  


The key one relevant to this is the two sections on lidar, which start here:

2021-05-23 02:49:17,stocks,Itt: people pissed off that a “cash reserves” list lists cash reserves instead of net cash.
2021-05-22 23:52:05,stocks,It's crazy that a company like Apple has a larger cash reserve then the GDP of practically the entire balkan region combined.
2021-05-22 23:26:31,stocks,Sweet! Have a number of these. Thanks for sharing.
2021-05-23 00:20:19,stocks,"Why do these lists never subtract debt?

BRB maxing all my credit accounts to increase my cash position

I didn’t check most of these but the Berkshire number is blatantly wrong.  Unless they’re only showing the A shares number or something weird."
2021-05-23 01:03:10,stocks,Well doesn’t say much if we dont know what is the debt and market cap
2021-05-23 00:17:13,stocks,Kind of misleading for IBM at least... they’ve got a ton of debt so this cash is basically vapor.
2021-05-23 14:33:16,stocks,"I'm really surprised that Alphabet and Facebook has so little debt relatively to all of its peers. Like not even close. Alphabet has a debt to equity ratio of around 0.06 as of March, 2021 (that's near it's historical high). Facebook basically has no debt. 

Comparatively, Apple has a debt to equity ratio of 1.76, MSFT is 1.3, Netflix's is well above 2. Amazon is the closest but still at 0.3. 

All these companies are obviously generating incredible revenue and net profit. But I'm wondering how the debt ratio would actually impact operations and long term strategic decisions."
2021-05-23 02:54:30,stocks,"I'm confused.  Yahoo lists Apple as having 70B in cash (and 135B in debt).  What else are they adding in?

2021-05-23 03:06:37,stocks,"This can also be seen negatively. 

Why don't they invest it? Are they out of ideas for R&D or investing it into acquisitions / growth?

If they have short-term or long-term debt additionally, the question would more be: 

why do they think not paying off the debt is smarter than being debt-free as fast as possible?

Holding ""a lot of cash compared to market cap"" is a luxury problem of developed companies or ones with an immense cashflow. 

It could be a sign of a management out of ideas or not using it for growth."

2021-05-23 03:13:57,stocks,Tesla should be number 12 shouldn't they?
2021-05-23 07:48:03,stocks,"I was thrown off that the list seems backwards.  So the company with more would be on top.

At least with the first four, Apple, Google, Microsoft and Amazon it is in the same order as profits.   

Apple makes more than Google and Google makes more than Microsoft and Microsoft makes more than Amazon.

BTW, I think a better number is offset with debt.   So for example Apple has over $100 billion of debt compared to Alphabet that has $14 billion."
2021-05-23 10:58:29,stocks,"Wait, Ford's cash reserves are roughly equal to its market cap?"

2021-05-23 04:20:16,stocks,"Ok not your little buddy but thanks for the info but the Forbes article is already outdated. I didn't list any gains or losses on my 1040 because I don't own any. I simply am stating what I have observed. I had to use Turbo Tax premier because I have a rental property and that's the first time I've seen anything about crypto in my tax returns. And maybe I didn't pay attention before because all I had for income was my W2 from my one job. 

Things have changed drastically in the last few months, Gary Gensler, SEC chair,  is a crypto expert and seems to be OK with regulating it and what I'm wondering is where this is headed. 

I'm on the fence about it, think it's got some issues with scalability and it's crazy volatile but I like the decentralization and I also know people who have made money off it so for me the jury is still out on it. 

What I'm wondering is that once the US government gets involved how is the worth going to be any different than fiat which is just as worthless when you analyze it? 🤷 

Plus it seems when one block chain gets completely used up, another crypto appears. Aren't they each on their own blockchains? Am I missing something? I admit I don't 100 percent understand it."

2021-05-23 02:07:02,stocks,I know this is strictly cash. But to better understand how much cash & cash equivalents a company has its best to include bond & equity investments since they could ideally be liquidated for their value very quickly.

Edit; I just read the and securities part... which leads me to a second question. Why are securities held counted in cash for a company?"
2021-05-23 04:05:59,stocks,So these companies are potentially losing billions a year from these reserves due to inflation.

2021-05-23 08:33:35,stocks,"I know high inflation is a nice easy thing to point out and suddenly every talking head on TV uses it to sound smart…

We are experiencing instantaneous inflation because of a downsized supply to demand, not due to hyper consumption demand.

Businesses have spent the last 14 months downsizing overhead and variable expenses to survive the cratered demand from the pandemic, and can now not come close to meeting the nationally synchronized increase in demand as vaccination allow us more freedom.

For Example: my colleague was freaking out about hyper inflation last week, b/c her rental car for summer vacation cost her $95/day for a sedan. Rental Car companies decimated their fleets when they realized there would be little to no demand for months if not year(s). Now as travel even picks up a bit (most people are still not getting in a plane for a family vacation), even the small spike in demand is creating a supple gap which will fix itself over the next six months…stop freaking out."

It's basically a matter of preparedness."

These things are unrelated, and plenty of companies do not receive bailouts.

Right, this just isn't true from a corporate lending perspective. Investors are not purchasing new debt at anything considered close to friendly rates for companies that are either defaulting on their debt or over leveraged to the point where they're no longer considered investment grade. 

>They can't pay, they get given more loans.

That kind of thing gets permanent real quick. People are not usually willing to take pay cuts after they've been hired, so if a company starts raising what they pay their workers, that is a permanent increase in their costs. That drives up prices and spurs inflation."

2021-05-23 18:53:28,stocks,"I don’t think it’s as simple as one dimension. There are many different things happening and they all have their own story. 

Some examples:
(1) Money supply has been high, but it’s mostly with banks and velocity isn’t (yet) high. 
(2) Technology and automation put downward pressure on inflation. 
(3) Supply issues in some sectors is temporary and should resolve, so inflation there is likely to be temporary - sawmills causing spike in lumber.
(4) Unemployment benefits disincentivizing some people to return to work, leading to lower output or increased wages. 
(5) Shipping costs much higher due to container shortages. 

Some things have not yet, but could cause inflation, some things have caused inflation but it’s temporary, some things will counteract inflation, and some things will drive inflation up. I think that’s why there are so many opinions and it’s incredibly hard to predict."
2021-05-23 08:04:28,stocks,"Yes to a point but higher inflation actually benefits companies with debt (assuming it serviced below the rate of inflation) more than companies with cash on hand.

At minimum, need to cover the basic reoccurring monthly expenses plus an emergency fund.  If you anticipate having some expenses or big purchases, you want more on hand.  Some of the emergency fund and spending money could be in slightly less liquid instruments for the purpose of yield depending on the situation.  

But other than that, any cash on hand will lose its value over time due to the never ending inflation machine.  You want the money to work for you, or at least retain its value regardless of inflation."
2021-05-23 08:03:46,stocks,"Yes. But in this particular situation, you‘d rather have 10000 houses which raise their value with inflation by 10% rather than cash which decreases in 10% because of inflation.

The result is that you see a lot of overnight investments with banks, money market funds, etc. With $50 B, they're probably pushing out tenors and getting some more uplift there, but I would be shocked if they're investing in anything too long term, or anything below investment grade CP of other companies or the like. The result is that their investment portfolio is earning something like <0.50% annually. Overnights are below 10 bps right now, money markets are below 5 bps, and low investment grade CP is like 20-30 bps for month long paper. It's a terrible time for yields.

2021-05-23 09:37:55,stocks,"Oh yeah on a macro scale the conditions for hiring are marginally better than they were. However if you look at the debt many Americans have, and the amount these companies are offering to attract employees, I don’t believe it’s inflationary. The minimum wage if it kept up with inflation properly would be $24, finally getting $15 after years of underpayment doesn’t undo the residual damage. In addition, $15 an hour still isn’t much in most areas. And you’re still bogged down from years of incurring debt, or not being able to save. Then we have the eviction moratorium still active and student loans not active which artificially inflated outstanding cash. I currently have $7k extra cash in my account just from loan payments I haven’t had to pay. I can’t spend that money, it’s for loans, but if you look at the money supply that’s “consumer funds and savings.” Plus, back to my earlier point about supply lines not being caused by currency inflation, the price increase from supply contraction is still very real, across utilities, groceries, transportation, and a vast number of products. That increase in prices lowers the amount you have left over to produce proper spending on consumer discretionary (which is the only spending that leads to actual inflation.) If grocery prices and electricity go up 30-40%, that is money I’m not using to shop and dine. 

I do hope that this issue leads to a more competitive environment that favors workers in all fields, but if it does cause inflation (which I doubt), it will take time."

My point was, those who choose not to invest might still believe the price might go up, in the short term of course, but the reason they don’t is because they don’t trust the company, the board of directors which is partly made up of CCP members, and the CCP itself which pretty much has entire control over the company, so in the longer term, it is not a fundamentally good company to invest in.

2021-05-23 00:00:00,stocks,"$CWH Camping World Holdings DD & Analysis A bit of research of one of my newer positions of my portfolio. Take all of this with a grain of salt. I am not a financial professional. I'm barely a Finance student (but I will be this Summer), Graduated with an International Business degree, and decided to double major and get a degree in Finance from 2021-2022 for personal reasons mostly. Having said that, here is my Bull Case for Camping World Holdings:

Overview: Camping World Holdings benefited in both the short and long term from the pandemic due to the lockdown creating a larger market for it's signature products, RV's, camping supplies, and other outdoor recreational products. With two consecutive years of warm seasonal pandemic swings occuring, Camping World Holdings has been in the position to capitalize and increase its Earnings Per Share drastically over the last 2 years. Despite this, the stock is still trading at a PE ratio of 8.47, despite its recent wave of earnings justifying a price of over twice it's current price of 40, as it's 5 year average justifies the stock trading at a PE Ratio of 20.47. With another pandemic summer occurring with another round of stimulus checks in many people's pockets, and with potential post-pandemic economic growth, CWH is in a position to benefit from it's recent growth and continue to deliver strong earnings into the next few years. CWH is also starting to emerge as a sneaky dividend stock, as it has recently increased its quarter dividend from .23 a share to .25 and has a current dividend yield of  2.5%, which is above average in its industry. 

Pros:

Trades at a very attractive valuation currently: It's currently trading at a PE ratio of 8.47. Over the last 5 years it's Earnings have been consistent with a PE ratio of 20.47. At it's current share price of just under 40 dollars a share, this stock is very undervalued in my opinion as both a growth and a value stock. 

Starting to emerge as a dividend stock: The market median for a dividend stock in its industry is a yield of 2.28%. With CWH's recent dividend hike, their yield is reasonably above this median at 2.5% and is likely to grow higher in the future. 

Q2 Hype: CWH is set to report 2nd Quarter earnings on the 3rd of August, a good bit of time from now, but it has high expectations to live up to. The current Low/High ranges between 8 Analysts range from 1.77 to 2.65 per share. Having said that, there's no reason to think that CWH won't deliver. It beat it's Q1 estimate average of .70 by 1.40 a share, and the upcoming hot weather mixed with pent up stimulus spending is likely to help this company into the next Quarter. Regardless of the Earnings outcome, hype around this quarter is likely to drive up the price as the earnings date comes closer due to speculation. 

Cons:

Traits of a Cyclical Stock: CWH runs the risks of other stocks with cyclical traits. While I believe there is enough short term substance to pent up stimulus spending and access to cheap debt to justify a short to medium term recommendation, for long-term investors the stock may be prone to cyclical downfalls.  Seeing as a large part of their revenue stream is RV repairs, and current RV sales growth will mean more RV repairs down the road, I think the cyclical nature will somewhat even out. 

High Q2 Expectations Mean High Volatility Risk: If the stock fails to deliver relative to what's priced in during Q2 earnings, the stock might take a dive. Anyone who may need this money within the next few months might not want to deal with the potential volatility. 

Conclusion:

I believe Camping World Holdings is great as both a Value and a Growth stock and has the potential to be a strong performer for years to come. Already trading at a great valuation and poised to benefit from a post-pandemic economy with extra stimulus money to be spent, I believe this is a great stock to own at it's current price point, and to pick up during a dip for any medium to long term value/growth investor."

I gather that this risk minimizing effect as a result of diversification also leads to less exposure of swings in currencies (when buying instruments in currencies other than that of your home countrys). However, if you live in country A with currency A, and buy a world tracker instrument in country B with currency B, will this cancel out the diversification effects, as my purchase would now be subject to swings between currency A and B?

Example:

\- Citizen in Denmark that has a local currency DKK  
\- Buys *iShares Core MSCI World UCITS ETF* (due to low 0.20% expense ratio) in USD

Would the above person cancel out the positive effects of diversification in regards to currency swings because he would now simply be subject to DKK/USD swings? Or is the entire premise wrong?"
2021-05-22 20:34:35,stocks,"You are subject to FX risks every time you buy and sell your ETF. You are also subject to FX risks if USD will drop further in value to DKK. Conversely, if USD rises strongly, your portfolio will gain further in value after DKK conversion but buying more will be painful. If you decide to DCA it may or may not be troublesome. And you have to look at a long time frame, 5 years, 10 years, 15? How will the world be like then? Will there be a decline in the economy? You can evaluate and look at some DKK denominated index funds though and see if their expense ratios vs the risks and trouble of doing it yourself , buying ETFs during US market timing vs a daily NAV price etc. Look at all options, see what other DKK people are doing before jumping in etc.
   
Add on, diversification is a different term. Instead of buying one single stock, you buy the range of top 500 eg S&P 500 ETF (as an example). So that if one single stock goes down, the rest doesn't rock too much and so does your investment portfolio."
2021-05-23 13:57:42,stocks,"Is it any benefit to own different ETF/ Mutual Funds of similar structure? Let's say you want to invest in s&p 500. Obvious choices could be VFIAX, FXAIX, VOO, SPY, SWPPX, etc. They mainly vary in expense ratio, net asset, and liquidity. Someone can just invest in one of those and that's it. While others would have two or more of those funds in their portfolio. Is it bringing any benefit?"
2021-05-23 17:35:05,stocks,If the US dollar goes into the trash as it should then holding other currencies will be a good move
2021-05-23 06:33:23,stocks,"But when I sell my stock, the exchange rate that my broker offers me, would be a result of current currency values. So, if the USD happens to have tanked at the time of selling, I get a horrible exchange rate that possibly cancels out the returns I made from the stock. No?"
2021-05-23 03:49:08,stocks,Exactly what this man said. So you should buy the USD one if you think the TER and bid-ask spread difference compensate for the initial and final fee for switching currencies
2021-05-23 18:31:27,stocks,"Suppose you have US$100. You exchange your US$ for XYZ$, at a rate of US$1 = XYZ$1. So you now hold XYZ$100.

Next, you use that XYZ$100 to purchase a share of ABC.ETF, conveniently priced at XYZ$100 per share (or, equivalently, US$100 per share).

Suppose that, for various economic reasons, the exchange rate falls to US$1 = XYZ$2 over the time during which you hold your share of ABC.ETF. 

Let's say the value of a share of ABC.ETF  increases to US$150. Due to the currency exchange rate, that share is now worth US$150 \* (XYZ$2 / US$1) = XYZ$300. Because you not exposed to XYZ$, the nominal value of your investment tripled.

What if the value of a share of ABC.ETF had dropped to US$75, losing a quarter of its value relative to US currency? It would be worth US$75 \* (XYZ$2 / US$1) = XYZ$150. Even though the value of your investment fell relative to the US$, the nominal value of your investment still increased in XYZ$, because you were sheltered from currency fluctuations while invested in ABC.ETF.

One big reason people invest in equities is that it eliminates most of the risk associated with inflation and currency value fluctuations."

2021-05-23 00:00:00,stocks,"How to actively manage a watchlist and information? Hi all, I’m hoping I can get some advice on how to actively manage my stock watchlist. Without getting to deep, I am primarily a US stock swing trader with a small (~5k) portfolio, though I also invest a good portion of my $$ into ETFs & lower risk/reward funds. I work part time and it’s lucrative enough to pay the bills and give me a bit of extra $$ to invest. 

I’ve been splitting my spare time between learning and trading. My strategy up to this point has been creating a spreadsheet of ~120 companies who’s charts I check every 1-3 days (depending on momentum of the trend), and never go longer than 2 weeks without checking a company’s chart. I spend 4-5 hours on weekdays reading charts & news, and journaling my arguments as to which way companies will move.

 However, I am starting to get a bit burnt out because I am constantly seeing new tickers, news, and significant movement within different market sectors. I am having trouble connecting all the dots and organizing information for the companies in my watchlist. I believe they all have merit, but I am getting overwhelmed trying to keep track of all the moving parts within. Right now, I use TD to trade & paper play, TradingView to chart and journal, Excel to keep track of my watchlists & when to check. I also use website like the S&P heat map, an economic calendar, and greed/fear gauge for news & overall market observation. I also use a trading discord but only listen to people I know are informed & reliable. 

I guess I feel overwhelmed by my strategy’s time frame / deadlines and the amount of potentially pertinent information I receive. I’d be grateful to hear from anyone with similar experience or understanding that could offer any tips, tricks, or advice in general."
2021-05-23 13:17:23,stocks,"Keep it simple my dude. You’re over complicating the matter. We are here to make money not stare at charts for 5-6 hours lol.

2021-05-23 00:00:00,stocks,"Thoughts on China, their economy and major stocks from their people follow (BABA) As you may know, BABA has been fallen 30% since it's high in October.  But their financial are just too good.  I spoke with several Chinese people yesterday who are living and working in China.  I wanted to get a feel for what the situation is on the ground, how they see the economy, future and thoughts on BABA/Jack Ma.


BABA Has 5 Operating Segments


China Commerce (65%): Segment revenues are derived from retail e-commerce and associated marketing services in China.


China Wholesale & Other (12%): Segment revenues are derived from wholesale commerce and logistics services, primarily driven by Chinese consumption.


Cloud Computing (8%): Segment revenues are derived based on customers' duration and usage of Alibaba's service.

International Commerce (8%): Segment revenues are derived from retail and wholesale operations as well as from advertising services outside China.


Digital Media & Innovation Initiatives (7%): Segment revenues are derived from content subscription, software subscription and merchant advertising offerings.

Alibaba (BABA) is one of the largest companies in China.  It's hard to truly understand everything they do, as they are involved in just about everything.  When Chinese pay for something, they don't use credit cards.  They use either WeChat/WeiXin (Tencent) or they use Alipay (BABA).  Nearly every Chinese person has these 2 apps on their phone.  It is essential.

----------
View from China

In speaking to Chinese people, as I have done for years, you have to understand everything is always going to be optimistic. From TV news to social media ""influencers"", the government is always sending messages to the people about how great...everything is and how not to trust outsiders.  So at first everyone was overly optimistic and diffused any thoughts I had of negative impressions.  This was to be expected.  As you dig further traces of truth open up.

First, China has done a decent job of getting the virus under control...but it's not as far a the US.  The population is so large it is going to take a full year from today to get 70% vaccinated.

These vaccines are less effective than what the US has.  They are in Phase III trials of their own mRNA vaccine which should be better.

Tourism won't come back this year as China is requiring everyone to have taken the Chinese vaccine to enter china as the moment.  

There is general optimism but I would call it cautious optimism.  The economy seems to be holding well, virus seems to be holding well...but many fear this could fall apart if something goes wrong.  

BABA

When asked about BABA and Jack Ma everyone heard about the fine paid by the company.  The said China is trying to crack down on monopolies and thus considered Alibaba as such.  All remain positive about Alibaba and Jack Ma but understood the government wants to protect the people.

What they think will happen?

Many felt Alibaba will continue to do well, but due to China's warning to them about Monopoly, they feel Alibaba will slow it's pace of growth.  Either intentional or mandated, this wasn't sure.  Alibaba can not continue on the same path forever.  It will not be allowed.  The fine was a warning to them.  Next step would be much drastic (prison for executives, company take over).  

---

Conclusion

Chinese are optimistic on their economy and Alibaba but with caution.  

I better understand the drop in BABA now.  It's not about how great they were in the past, but the fear of what will happen if they continue this way...and realistically they can not continue.  
A few speculated that the company will now be more controlled by the government but this is speculation.

Hope it helps."

2021-05-22 22:02:38,stocks,"From what I understand being Chinese and speaking to the non-investing relatives, the whole Jack Ma situation is personal and not fully related to the monopoly crackdown. The general rumor is that Ma’s backers were Mao’s descendants , who has been very outspoken and arrogant towards the current president. With the recent years of anti-corruption crackdowns, the descendants who use to have a great influence in the CCP has greatly lost power.  Jack has used their influence and arrogance to get where he is. The current president is taking advantage of their lost of power and the excuse of the monopoly crack down to show Ma who’s the “real” boss."

2021-05-23 04:11:43,stocks,"i think that getting back to 50 a share will almost be impossible until they send branson up. You have to remember that there was an incredible plethora of good events that got it up there in the first place.

- Cathie started the space fund, signifying to retail investors that space might really be the next frontier . She also bought a ton more shares. 

- Then the whole short squeeze started happening, and any stocks that hedge funds had so much as a single bad thought about rocketed. Not to mention, the whole short squeeze brought in a ton of new ""dumb money"". 

- Then, test flights were rescheduled. 

- All while nasdaq was going absolutely nuts to start the year.

- and SPAC euphoria (and by extension anything having to do with SPACs) were on an absolute tear.

- and growth stocks as a whole were the place to be.

Now, growth stocks are dead. Cathie has sold off all her holdings of SPCE. Nasdaq is treading water and barely up on the year, while having a terrible run the last few weeks. Inflation fears have killed growth stocks with no/bad balance sheets, and SPACs, once the darling of the retail investment community, are dead. 

By comparison, in january,  you wouldn't find a single SPAC trading under NAV. Regardless of what SPAC you were, an LOI whisper sent it up at least 10%. Now, without a DA in place, very few SPACs trade above NAV. heck some are even still at NAV with an LOI."

2021-05-23 10:35:41,stocks,True but I would rather take profits and pay taxes on a 4x gain verses hold and only have a 2x gain sitting. In speculative names you gotta take profits when your up big. Paying taxes mean you made money and over the 12 years I’ve traded stocks for a living I’ve paid a ton of taxes but that is the goal......

2021-05-23 09:12:28,stocks,"Me too, there's a lot of things I could of sold high and bought back in for less then my original price but there is no guarantee you will get a chance or that you will have the money or even see the opportunity. I think that's why they say you have a better chance just holding and adding on dips historically because you wont catch the bottom everytime. I think I'm only going to try it when there is absurd volatility like a 65% gain in a day because there's a good chance volatility will bring it back down. Just got to plan on buying back in for potentially a higher price."
2021-05-23 12:27:10,stocks,All good. I must still be a little annoyed by that loss :) I’m glad I sold even at a huge loss but I’m still curious to see what the stock does Monday!

I intend to hold long term because I see it going way higher than that eventually, but I'd be lying if I said I wouldn't be tempted to sell as I could really do with the money now - and it will inevitably dip again as it has after every single major piece of news, so I could buy back in if I wanted to"
2021-05-22 21:21:33,stocks,"Oh, certainly, the strike is above what I paid for it and I've already got the premiums."
2021-05-22 21:31:48,stocks,Pharmacology grad student. I like BIO and TMO
2021-05-22 21:58:48,stocks,"Right on. You can think that CRISPR is gonna cure all ailments and diseases in 15 years (which is an ambitious claim - if something sounds like science fiction the reality is often much much more nuanced and has a long way to go), but even if that was true, that doesn’t mean the small companies looking into it now will be around forever. Biotech companies are notoriously difficult to start, don’t return profits for a long time, and are dependent on the FDA, and I’m sure the owners are just hoping to sell to Merck, Pfiszer, etc. once the time is right. Trying to commercialize something that is intrinsically out of your control and left to nature (scientific results) is extremely stressful cause you can do everything completely right for 2 decades and wind up with absolutely nothing. If I started a company like that and it wound up becoming profitable, I wouldn’t start calling myself the new Bill Gates and stick with it. I’d sell to the highest bidder ASAP.

Also love what you said about TMO. If there is one constant in my life as a graduate researcher, it is absolutely Thermo Fisher. If there is an option to buy something with Thermo, I will, even if it’s 50% more expensive. Their partnerships with research institutions like mine just make it easier to order from them than from competitors. Don’t even need to use a purchasing card - it’s all in the system. And they sell almost everything. They’re not going anywhere and if biotech grows, a small biotech company might not, but Thermo sure will. Cause almost every single item that went into conducting every experiment was probably purchased through Thermo or Sigma. And they are the masters of upchargjng for items, but have a customer base that cares less about being upcharged because “that’s just how it is in science.”"
2021-05-22 21:02:41,stocks,"Ive been holding TMO since 2017


Ive got great returns"
2021-05-23 11:28:13,stocks,"You're hugely simplifying the supply chain side of things. VWR and Fisher (owned by TMO) are the most commonly used catalog services for consumables, but that doesn't mean they make all of them. Corning and BD, as well as brands owned by Thermo like Pyrex and Nalgene, are big in lab plastics and glassware. For chemicals, in addition to Fisher and J.T. Baker (owned by TMO and AVTR respectively), MilliporeSigma (Merck KGaA outside the US) is huge and there are a lot of smaller brands. For things like gloves and paper products, it's mostly KimTech (a Kimberly-Clark brand). For more specialized things there's always a variety of providers. Eppendorf is synonymous with microcentrifuge tubes. Cytiva (Danaher), MiliporeSigma, and BioRad are big providers of chromatography resins and Repligen has kind of cornered the market on prepacked columns. Filters vary based on types with the workhorse ones mostly provided by MilliporeSigma or Sartorius in my experience. I've mostly seen depth filters from 3M, viral filters from MilliporeSigma or Asahi Kasei, and TFF filters from Pall (also Danaher).  

I'd also say that you're simplifying the equipment space, particularly downplaying how big Danaher is (especially since the Cytiva acquisition). Mettler Toledo definitely deserves a mention for scales, pipets (Rainin is one of their brands), and pH meters. Sartorius also makes equipment of larger scale for manufacturing. There's also a ton of more niche equipment made by more specialized brands."

2021-05-23 16:22:28,stocks,"I work in biotech, my facility buys from, collaborates with, and even provides to multiple of the companies you mentioned. My advice? Don't invest in biotech. Don't get me wrong, the whole sector wouldn't exist if capital investors didn't give us money to make and do incredible things for the biomedical field, but investing here is nothing more than putting your money in a slot machine. For the average retail investor, you'll lose 99% of the time, it just is not worth the gamble. I myself manage several projects/collaborations with multiple companies, we get approached by probably 6-12 companies EVERY YEAR who want to use our facility/collaborate/do clinical trials/etc and maybe 1 a year is truly in a position to take the next step. Even the companies that have all their shit together, all their ducks in a row, capital backing, basic research done, advisers and connections in the field...maybe 10% of them actually succeed and make it past phase 2. 

&#x200B;

Biotech is a huge future for every single person on this planet, in reality the vast majority of the human population will directly benefit from advances in biotech made over the last 30 years and the future 50+ years. But investing in biotech will more than likely make you a loser."

2021-05-22 20:42:04,stocks,I agree with all that it may not have found bottom yet. $200 seems more of psychological round number support then technical support. I would want to see some consolidation happen before starting to average into this security.

How about when we went to war with Vietnam because hurrdurr communism?

we put Japanese people in camps on us soil. We have done so much horrible shit in other countries but we don’t even educate our population on the atrocities we have committed. Matter or fact right now the GOP is trying to remove slavery from being taught in our schools, so our young generation can be even more ignorant, wonderful.
Our government is just as bad trying to whitewash history and always make ourself look better than we are. 
History is written by the winners and white colonialism has been dominant on the globe for many decades. During these times I guarantee we left out horrible shit we did to poor people from the books.

2021-05-23 05:29:07,stocks,"Indeed, January was the last month where everything did go up."
2021-05-23 09:16:38,stocks,"Sad but true.  I think a lot of the ""missed"" dates were because of TA (which there was A LOT of), which doesn't really apply to GME because of the manipulation and it's not going off of fundamentals.  But at the same time, it's fun to look at wedges and triangles and breakouts etc. etc. So it gains traction.  
The real DD always alludes to ""no dates"" because the real DD's prediction of when things could pop is based on margin calls or share recalls.  The latter being more likely which requires Gamestop themselves to do something (Merger, dividends, etc.)  
Personally, I'm not going to be concerned with the DD being wrong until a week or two passes after the shareholder meeting (June 6th) and nothing happens.  If that comes to be, then I'll need to see some convincing explanation why.  
But at the end of the day, the entire market is a gamble and there are options available to literally do just that, gamble.  So I'll happily place a bet on GME. *Not financial advice*"

2021-05-22 20:00:29,stocks,"A stock split would be incredible. With all the hype around the stock, it would definitely shoot back up at least to current levels, but with retail having 10x or 5x or whatever shares (and shorts shorting their pants)"

I don't have a particularly large position, low XX, but the Robinhood stuff didn't sit quite right with me. I felt that enough people were still invested in this that it was worth taking a chance on. I'm not a 7 figure believer but I think the stock can get in to the low-mid 4 figures during a ""squeeze"" before we start to see the massive sell offs. I think those who truly believe in 10 million a share are true idealists and realistically going to get burned. That being said I'm fairly committed to just hanging on to half of my shares. Best case scenario, the folks over at Superstonk are right and I accelerate my financial planning a couple decades. Worst case, I break even or lose a couple hundred dollars on it. It's been fun either way. I wouldn't be hugely disappointed losing my money and considering it payment for entertainment haha.

I pray for the people who are refinancing their homes or selling their cars. This has potential to be a life-ruining event for them if they lose out."

All the speculation you are calling a conspiracy has actual data that has led these individuals to come up with a certain conclusion.

2021-05-22 23:36:59,stocks,"$ASTS - AST SpaceMobile.


It's a company that uses satellites to allow a 5G signal to your phone from anywhere on the planet (similar to Starlink but for phones). 


The killer features are that you don't need to buy ANY additional hardware like you would for Starlink, it works with any phone in existence right now.

AND they partner with existing carriers, so you don't need to switch carriers or anything to get 5G everywhere. You just pay an extra dollar a month on top of your normal bill. 


The reason why it's down is that it was recently brought public by SPAC, and the institutional investors dropped their stock as soon as it went public. Secondly, while they have launched test satellites, the full satellite fleet has not been launched (will be by the end of 2022). So since the market hates pre-revenue companies recently, it was a victim of the tech/growth slaughter."

I’m not saying your suggestion is poor, but it’s also coming from the same person who posted 3hours prior to this comment asking if those specific stock choices were good? I like your choices but maybe some background would be nice as to why not ARKK, and why your choices. ARKK/Cathie Woods portfolio has dropped significantly over the past few months and have also stated to be prepared for this ETF to be volatile. I love MSFT as AWS has been growing out the wazoo, AAPL and GOOG have the highest cash reserves of any company to do/invest however they’d like and even during COVID have had incredible growth so could absolutely fit into OP’s individual stock choices leaning towards growth sector. ARKK is as speculative as it gets as Cathie invests in disruptive technology, not a bad choice specific to OPs thought process and request for alternative ETFs specifically."

I believe these have less risk than actually shorting (as long as you are careful about which you use and how long you hold it for).

Generally you don't want to hold those for long, so unless you think the S&P is going to tank within a few days.

Of course, holding this will offset some gains, so more useful if you can buy just before hand or you are 100% sure it's going to tank and you are just waiting for it to so (in which case, the 1X or 2X wouldn't be bad, as loing as you don't go too heavy into it and sell near-ish to the bottom)"

It could be that economies continue to reopen and earnings continue to bounce back. Which would still leave us at high multiples, but those would be more easily explainable by current yields. 

Put another way, the other times you saw PEs like this, we were at the end of major economic expansions, not at the tail end of a contraction.

There is an awful lot of deferred spending out there, be it automobiles, travel and leisure, dining out, etc. If we're going to point at today's P/E's and say that's unsustainable, I'm only going to point out that there is a torrent of cash that's eager to be spent.

Of course, a lot of that money will probably come from cashing out investments made in the stock market last year:

[https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/09/investors-have-put-more-money-into-stocks-in-the-last-5-months-than-the-previous-12-years-combined.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/09/investors-have-put-more-money-into-stocks-in-the-last-5-months-than-the-previous-12-years-combined.html)

For myself, I've moved away from more of the speculative assets and really cut back my QQQ exposure, though I do continue to hold Apple and Microsoft. But companies like Target only benefit from more people returning to work. I've recently bought both Toyota and Ford, thinking that the semi shortage will eventually come to an end and a lot of cars will be bought as that's cleared up and as people feel more confident in their jobs remaining stable.

I'm not a fan of bonds at these yields, but am a fan of TIPS, so I've got a decent allocation (nearly 10%) to TIPS, and another 6% in gold as my inflation hedges. 

On the other hand, I'm around 7-8% cash as my hedge that I'm wrong and buying opportunity arises.

Again what happens next is anyones guess. But you can't only look at P/E of the market and conclude that we're on the precipice of another meltdown. People love to look back at the recent history and position themselves for a repeat of that. Witness everyone that stayed in cash during the last rebound. Witness everyone who piled into crypto AFTER its huge run up last year. Witness everyone that's in that certain stock which certainly went through a short squeeze, eagerly awaiting a repeat of that event."

The entire point to ""cloud"" is you can leverage the cloud provider network for easy scaling. Otherwise, if you dont need scale, its really no different than a traditional setup. But governments have unlimited funds, value security over efficiency and their scale is limited to their own country and possibly a few other nodes.

In other words, government moving to 3rd party services will be limited. You are asking them to risk security (more eyes who can see data) for convenience... governments generally dont do that except for less important data. For instance when I worked for them, they would use 3rd party servers for things like the monthly defac menu or for sports events or sales at the local retail store. But nothing vital ever leaves the military networks.

Again growth will come but I think people are over estimating the growth potential. Government shouldnt be counted on to generate more growth. Cloud is more useful for commercial purposes to provide high performance on large scale."

2021-05-23 08:58:04,stocks,I agree especially since I keep buying this nonstop dip in that other market on Coinbase. Little increments here and there to amass more.
2021-05-23 10:30:55,stocks,Which coins are they?
2021-05-23 15:14:41,stocks,"I tried using their paid service one this year, been down around 50-70% for all their reocmmendation"
2021-05-23 18:09:45,stocks,Why’s that?
2021-05-23 16:39:26,stocks,"This is a fair point.

Why is nvda trading at such high multiples? It seems bloated"
2021-05-23 18:16:11,stocks,"Great insights.

What do you think of Yahoo Finance moving into the brokerage territory (like Robinhood), allowing people to makes trades on their app -- not just monitor their trades. Either done by building out their own brokerage platform, or by partnering with 3rd party brokers to make trades via Yahoo Finance?"
2021-05-23 14:47:39,stocks,"you cant help ignorant people, dont waste your time"
2021-05-23 11:21:25,stocks,zing!
2021-05-23 14:10:52,stocks,Because the supply has stopped because of covid and it’s a matter of time until suppy catches back up.
2021-05-23 15:48:55,stocks,60 :)
2021-05-23 11:47:42,stocks,"Home sales are down because there is not enough supply. Demand is still high. I am in Chicago. My two friends are in TX and Utah. We all see the same situation - cash offers with $30-50k over asking. 

I lived through 2008 - that was different because people were buying who shouldn’t have been buying with 100% loans expecting to make profit in 2 years."
2021-05-23 13:36:55,stocks,City folk are going back to the city? Where did you see that?
2021-05-23 15:58:51,stocks,Yea they are high growth and growth is out of flavor right now. But the ones they picked that are down a lot have tons of potential long term
2021-05-23 03:49:49,stocks,So opinion of European do not interested you I guess? Outside Europe I'm eyeing a India based ETF for long haul.
2021-05-23 18:21:38,stocks,"Look at their pricing history and their respective valuations. It is evident that since the pandemic began, enthusiasm for having these stocks has skyrocketed. There are several reasons for this that make sense, including increasing earnings, but a large component is speculative fervor on the part of new tech- and gaming-happy investors, IMO. Keep in mind that these companies likely enjoyed increased profits because of the stay-at-home lifestyle as of late, and it's hard to imagine that the trends will continue upward at a similar rate as the pandemic wanes. It's not as if people are buying new GTX's or processors every year. You could say that these companies, particularly NVDA, are priced for perfection. There's simply not much juice left to squeeze out of them at this point, IMO. That's why I would just wait for a better opportunity.

Like all market manias, the present one will end eventually, either dreadfully slow or with a violent bang, and the stocks hyped up the most are the ones most vulnerable to loss as enthusiasm turns into fear."
2021-05-23 17:09:50,stocks,"NVDA trying to push more into the high growth markets like crypto (GPU), self driving cars, AI makes it more speculative. But personally I think AMD can steal Intel’s market share easily so it’s safer easier money."
2021-05-23 18:30:13,stocks,"I mean, I don't know. I am pretty much set with my broker. If I was starting out, I'd definitely, definitely consider them. I looked at a lot of apps, and none seem to satisfy me. How easy would it be to make a trade? How fast are they with depositing money? Will they be secure? Yahoo has a history of not being secured. A lot of variable. I am very happy with my current broker and will keep using Yahoo finances as a supplementary app to dig further on companies I am interested in."
2021-05-23 15:48:42,stocks,"That's only half the story. There was an increase in demand, especially since more people were doing projects at home. Housing has been in demand as well. I don't see the prices dropping anytime this year, if they ever do. Inflation may just keep them at the current price."
2021-05-23 18:17:31,stocks,I meant in front of the 3 but yes lol
2021-05-23 11:54:18,stocks,"How do you know that? The data still shows it went down. Furniture sales went down. Apartments are getting filled up. There are folks that havent paid their mortgage, and the relief ends in June 30. Supply is about to go up way more."
2021-05-23 15:26:48,stocks,These are interesting anecdotes.  I wonder how in the world there's so much money sloshing around to be able to make these types of offers? Any idea?
2021-05-23 16:35:21,stocks,">not enough supply

&#x200B;

that's not gonna last forever. People are cashing in now when supply is low.

but like overpriced stock, those who wait will get COIN-like deals."
2021-05-22 20:28:04,stocks,"True but consider this from a growth portfolio perspective. Apple has a 2.1T market cap, the largest of any company. To even get an annualized return of 20% over the next 5 years, Apple would have a 5T market cap. I just don’t know how likely that is."
2021-05-23 12:01:30,stocks,"You're seriously pulling strings here trying to twist things.

>can these institutions **stop fucking my Himax $HIMX**? I'm never going to sell and I'm going to keep buying **every dip**

I'm not going to sell when the prices has been repeatedly dipping. I don't think I need to be very specific on such a common sense comment relative to the stock markets. I'm sorry if you're trying to push for every word to be taken literally. Point being: I'm never going to sell on these dips\*

Are you happy? Do I need to be more precise on anything else?"
2021-05-23 16:41:25,stocks,"And do you expect this demand to continue for forever? 

There's only so many homes to be bought and projects to do."
2021-05-23 15:55:15,stocks,I want to know that myself.  Our neighbors sold their condo and ended up making over $100k in just 3 years. And that’s a condo. Cash offer. Sold in low 7 figures. I don’t get it.
2021-05-23 16:38:14,stocks,I am waiting. I have my home but have been waiting for years to get an investment property. It is only getting worse and worse. I hope it dips at some point. Not going to pay a million dollars for a garden unit condo.
2021-05-23 17:15:22,stocks,"Considering we expect another 3 billion people to be living on this planet I  the next few decades... yeah, I think the demand for lumber and housing will continue due to increase. Do you have any graphs of longterm downtrends? I'm guessing it always goes up."
2021-05-23 16:43:31,stocks,"same. I'm looking for fixers with good bones.

I'm not doing stupid shit like fighting to pay over-asking.

sellers are greedy now because they see the insanity in the market"
2021-05-23 13:22:24,stocks,"This is not the case. Most oat milk contains amylase (an enzyme) that converts starches into sugars.
 They also use a centrifuge to keep solids from seperating and add oils for texture and better steaming in barista versions.

 I work in a zero waste coffee shop (how trendy I know) and making commerical grade oat milk in even a good blender like a vitamix is not viable, it just tastes like a sad bowl of porridge.

I grew up on a dairy farm so I can honestly say I have nothing against good ol' fashioned moo milk, but after drinking strictly oat milk for a few months I seriously don't enjoy a latte or milk itself anymore, just tastes like straight up titty juice."
2021-05-23 11:33:14,stocks,"I have been wondering this for awhile but what is the difference between draft kings and a normal betting site (besides the fantasy sports)? I have been using a regular betting site for awhile now and works just fine for me. 

What is Draft Kings offering besides a guaranteed win amount of $ that you cant cash out unless u place like 1000 bets or something. that was my impression. please let me know where I am wrong? thx"
2021-05-23 11:25:17,stocks,why is this a bit of a touchy subject for people?
2021-05-23 11:34:54,stocks,DKNG is one of the stocks on this sub that people get kind of aggressive about on both bull/bear cases.
2021-05-22 20:57:03,stocks,Do you think they are worth an investment? This can be a hit or miss bigly lol
2021-05-22 23:13:28,stocks,"Look up Dan Loeb who dropped Palantir shares and picked up Paysafe.  I don’t know anything about this game but if the big boys are making moves like this, must be something to it."
2021-05-23 04:12:28,stocks,"You said self driving tech is not possible. It's not possible to prove that. I'm trying to show there are self driving cars, it is possible, and will happen."
2021-05-23 11:46:08,stocks,"If there is a human who has to correct for errors then its not self driving. If it has to be placed in a controlled environment then its not self driving. Its at best, assisted and its value plummets."

2021-05-22 21:50:58,stocks,CLOV is solid
2021-05-23 02:02:26,stocks,VVPR is a hidden gem
2021-05-23 08:52:29,stocks,SFT. It’s a little gem in the making. Crushed last two quarters. 3k shares deep. I think it will continue to blow out earnings. Just slowly accumulating at the bottom here patiently waiting. 5 year hold minimum
2021-05-23 08:54:14,stocks,Holding a large position in SFT. It’s going to do well. Hoping the word doesn’t get out for a while so I can keep buying the bottom here. Revenue was huge last quarter
2021-05-23 14:00:31,stocks,Have you looked at BLDE?
2021-05-23 14:06:01,stocks,"I like Ehang more, because they are doing autonomous drones. So, I already have exposure in this industry and I don't think helicopter person transport is something with that much future. 

With that being said I don't know much about BLDE. It's probably a decent stock/company, but I did not do enough DD to tell."
2021-05-23 14:27:10,stocks,"Well, it just merged from the SPAC EXPC. Blade already has a large and growing market in medical transport and posted huge revenue growth just last week, despite it being pandemic time still. 

It's cheaper than EH by price to sales. eVTOL has a big future -- it's literally flying cars. They're not helicopters by the way! And they fill a niche especially in places like the Northeast. With distances and pricing"
2021-05-23 16:06:24,stocks,"Sounds decent! Although, I wouldn't use price to sales to compare them. Both are super early in their corporate lifecycle. Revenues are simply to small to be a decent measure for future potential. Besides, I think Ehang has a way bigger TAM."
2021-05-23 14:59:55,stocks,You the man
2021-05-23 17:03:59,stocks,"It's not a great time to be buying stocks or anything imo.

I would wait until the fall personally."
2021-05-23 18:01:40,stocks,"Thanks for sharing. Particularly on the biggest mistake looking back. It's hard to time when to go in, but can control emotions on the way out.

Once it hits a sufficient size, I can see the comfort in having a professional planner deal with it."
2021-05-23 18:06:54,stocks,"I appreciate the insight, great advice. Similar challenges and errors I make on sunk costs and not knowing the right purchase splits."
2021-05-23 01:51:30,stocks,Then you ll lose it all in your next all in son
2021-05-22 20:30:45,stocks,But its based on shares issued. So if Ford had half as many shares but double the price it would have the same market cap at double the price. So share price alone is not a good measure of the company's value.
2021-05-23 14:07:40,stocks,"Think what a lousy piece of shit you have to be to root against America, as a supposed American."

2021-05-23 09:00:51,stocks,"One thing you might consider is the geopolitical situation in Chile, where SQM is based.

Chile is in the midst of political crisis since mid 2019 and its not looking good.  Far-left politicians just cleaned up in the most recent elections and the private sector is very fearful.  See the 10%+ dive SQM took the day after the election results.

Chile is in a better economic situation than many other Latin countries, but it's not clear how long that will hold, particularly with the new party coming into power and the people becoming increasingly restless for major political and economic reforms.

With a lot of other lithium miners to consider, I'd be careful.  

I'm holding PLL and LAC long-term. I think lithium and rare-earth miners are going to benefit from the developing realization by the US govt and DoD that a lack of domestic supply chains for EV tech is a major national security risk."
2021-05-23 02:10:25,stocks,I upvoted this so more people can benefit with a good laugh.
2021-05-23 08:45:51,stocks,Calls on amc is your best bet of hitting the big time albeit it’s a lottery.
2021-05-23 16:32:55,stocks,"EXPI looks like a good play long-term. I bought the dip at 25$ and am slowly DCA’ing, similar to OPEN it seems to have bottomed. But again, price action is something we should watch in the coming weeks."
2021-05-23 07:41:02,stocks,"Google arguably only has one major source of income: online ads. Their cloud business has gained steam recently, but they'd easily be a trillion dollar business without it. Same goes for Facebook.

Visa and MasterCard are literally a duopoly in the card payment business. It will take a huge disruption *and* missteps from both companies for them to not reach the one trillion market cap mark. 

NVDA might falter, but they are nicely diversified at this point with revenues from data centers, gaming, and crypto."
2021-05-22 23:56:16,stocks,"Sold ET in January. 

Bought GBTC last week because of the discount to NAV.

2021-05-23 09:06:25,stocks,SFT. 5x bagger in my opinion. Growing at a rapid rate. Small cap with big growth. It’s competitive but recent earnings do the talking.
2021-05-22 22:37:21,stocks,Yeah he does. He can fire Jerome powell
