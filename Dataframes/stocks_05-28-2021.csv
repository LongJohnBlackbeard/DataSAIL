2021-05-28 19:16:39,stocks,"I am a fan of dividends; yet everything a company can chose to do with its Free Cash Flow adds compounding value to the shareholder: Pay Dividends; Buyback Shares, Build more locations, etc.

Focusing on only companies that pay a dividend is a valid plan; yet make sure you never buy a stock just because it pays a dividend and more importantly never buy a dividend stock regardless of the price being overvalued or undervalued just because it pays a dividend."
2021-05-28 19:22:13,stocks,"That's a good plan unless it drops to 0. 

Here's a counter example using your own example.

Zoom out on T. The last 5 years, T has been dropping in stock price and net income. If the trend continues that div is going to get cut. 

Add to that their mismanagement over the past years, I have no confident in T in the long run."
2021-05-28 19:24:57,stocks,"First of all there’s nothing wrong with not going to college. The trades are every bit as important as any other job, and they take just as much skill and knowledge as any other profession, plus as there are less and less people joining the trades demand for skilled tradesman will increase and the pay will get even better. 

As far as investing advice, I think it’s wise to invest extra once you have a healthy emergency savings. That said always keep on eye on the future. If you are planning on a big purchase and will end up needing to sell stocks, it may be a good idea to beef up the savings because a swing in the market could hamper your ability to make that big purchase. For example, if you’re planning on buying a house I wouldn’t use a brokerage account as my “savings” account for the down payment. Someone might argue you could put it somewhere relatively “safe” in the market like a broad index fund, but even then anything can happen.

Beyond that I think you’ve got the basics down. Compounding is your best friend, but keep in mind that stocks can always go down, so your ROI may go from say the 14 yrs you predicted when you buy something to 100 with a dividend cut. For that reason make sure you do your due diligence on stocks you plan on holding for a long time. Think about the industry and whether it will even be around at the end of your predicted ROI period. 

Also because you are young then growth stocks aren’t necessarily a bad thing so you might want to portion at least a small part of your portfolio into them even if they don’t pay dividends yet. For example, someone who bought Amazon 20yrs ago would be a lot better off than someone who bought an equal amount of T."
2021-05-28 19:18:03,stocks,"JPM is a good dividend paying stock I've had some for a long time. 
HYG is an ETF that pays monthly dividends."
2021-05-28 19:13:39,stocks,"i like ETFs, it spreads the risk around to multiple stocks. But I agree that dividends and value investing will likely outperform growth investing, at least in the near term feature."
2021-05-28 19:25:49,stocks,"At 23 you should start building a dividend portfolio. I’m of the same age and have begun to build mine. The big draw of dividends is compound interest and letting time build your money for you. 

Say you want to retire in 40 years, a reasonable sum now using a DRIP will help you build for retirement"
2021-05-28 19:27:00,stocks,"I understand, I was using T as an example due to it being easy to remember. I’ve also started DD on IRM and IBM. Mostly wanting to look at potential future market and ensuring I can hold is somewhat securely over 5-10 years if not longer."
2021-05-28 19:30:44,stocks,"That’s fair advice. I’m going to try and keep almost every position I have at roughly 10% and then rotate and expand to where every position is closer towards 5%. For me this isn’t a get rich quick scheme. It’s a means towards retirement one day eventually. 

I’ll have to take a closer look at some growth stocks and put some dedicated manpower into them."
2021-05-28 19:33:06,stocks,I have not heard of a DRIP yet and I have to say I appreciate you so much. I’m going to add it to my list of needed research.

Theres a shift in the market because blue chips and large caps are so over bought. Think about it, what is your average investor gonna do with 1 or 2 shares of Amazon, nothing. There's hardly any room for growth with that. Why do that when you can buy like 5000 shares of something glthat got beat up from short sellers during covid because of shut downs. Hell I bought a few REITs that were recovering from 2008 and then covid hit and are back at 2008 market crash levels. Sometimes it just takes things longer to recover than others.

2021-05-28 17:40:55,stocks,"really? would you mind giving some examples, ive never heard of a reverse merger resulting in a ticker change"
2021-05-28 16:13:18,stocks,"The main misunderstanding you have is that someone has to be trading for the price to change.  Stocks don't actually have a price.  What they have are a bid, ask, and last.  The last is what is commonly referred to as the price, and it is the last price the stock traded at.  However you cannot make a trade at that price.  If you are buying you can only buy at the ask or higher meaning you can only buy at the price someone is willing to sell to you at.  You can set a limit and refuse to buy above a certain price but if the ask is higher than that your order will not be filled.  The same thing is true of selling but that is based on the highest bid.  What this means is that the price can change without any trades happening.  You can see this on very illiquid markets like out of the money options where both the bid/ask are well above or below the last meaning you will never get the last price for a new trade.  This also happens when a stock is halted.  When it resumes it will usually open a lot higher or lower than where it was previously trading.  The same thing could happen over the weekend if there is news.  Granted there will be trading in pre/post market but that is not happening over the weekend just Friday afternoon or Monday morning."

2021-05-28 18:32:57,stocks,"The same companies trade on different exchanges around the globe using different tickers. Since the time differences cause one exchange to be open while another is closed, you get the effect of \~\~24 hour trading. When you trade, you see your opening price as the one from the closing of the previous exchange ticker.  Plus, there are extending hour and after hour trading."

While index funds have not performed as well, them being diversified across multiple sectors gives your portfolio more stability. There is also no guarantee that tech will continue to be the most dominant sector on the off chance that inflation and interest rates go out of control."
2021-05-28 17:48:43,stocks,"Though these arent bad picks, I personally dont recommend it. Im a tech guy too but I play it much more defensively at a time when valuations are high. Remember its not just comparing valuation, there is also macro conditions to consider.

For example, right now, the entire market PE is in bubble territory with the S&P500 PE hovering around 45. Even though we can explain this rationally with covid earnings, low interest, bonds being dead money, inflation, and other things, markets are not rational.

So for me personally, I play defensive when the macro indicators are bad. Thats not to say I dont like AMZN, GOOG, APPL or MSFT, but that I dont trust valuations.

Right now I am basically running 25% cash, and I would say 50% of my actual portfolio (not including the cash) is defensive. Consumer cyclicals, consumer non-cyclicals, blue chip with low PE+Div growth, real estate and I even have some fixed income (preferred stock for REITs I consider reliable long term).

I would suggest you take the macro indicators into account. I also highly recommend a div paying strategy and letting the pot of cash build itself for dips and crashes.

Now if markets PE starts to look good again (sub 30), then I would probably switch the strategy to what you are doing and just buy high growth cash cows. Which is what I basically did last year in the crash and in the financial crash though I didnt buy tech specifically this time around.

As a final disclosure, my 15 year performance is absurd using the flexible strategy above. Most dont believe it but its basically about 30% yoy growth... Not saying everyone can replicate this but as it turns out, like great chefs, great investors can come from anywhere."

Its forward P/E is 40 - lower than AMZN's (45), not much higher than MSFT's (30), etc. It isn't like they have some kind of crazy 100+ forward P/E evaluation. Plus their forward P/E is justified from their insane growth, which has been happening even despite the chip shortage. There is a high demand for their current products that will only grow and they are getting into CPUs now. And even more forward looking, they are the overwhelming leader in AI with CUDA so I just don't see their growth slowing any time soon. IMO, their valuation is more than fair given their future growth trajectory."

2021-05-28 13:53:34,stocks,"VIACP is a preferred share that will pay this higher dividend for about 3 years but in April 2024 each VIACP will be converted mandatorily into about 1.0013 to 1.1765 Class B shares(depending on the calculation)

Hence VIACP will be valued on both based on value to VIAC and future dividends.

Now you can decide depending on your time horizon if you want to take the trouble of switch for higher dividend as it only for 3 years."
2021-05-28 14:22:09,stocks,"as for someone who lacks in dividend experience.

is 0.24 cents per share.. decent? We saw RKT dish out 1.2 or something and per doubly cheaper share.

what's the consensus here, can someone elaborate?"
2021-05-28 16:03:16,stocks,"Looking at the maths.    
3 payments this year. 4 each in 2022 and 2023. One in 2024.    
So there's 12 dividend payments.     
If we assume 1.55 each time that's payment of 18.60 dollars.    
Now the standard stock will probably pay 0.25 dollars per quarter or or 3 over the same time period.
The difference is 15.6 dollars.    
Note you pay witholding or income tax on that too so you don't even profit by that much unless it's in a Roth IRA.    
After this the stock reverts to let's say 1.10 shares.    
Current share value of 42.5 would be approx 47 dollars of shares.    
I calculate 62.6 dollars of value in VIACP.    
And I didn't even factor in the time value of money in the dividend payments which would reduce it further..."
2021-05-28 16:14:44,stocks,"Look at it as a percentage.    
0.24 each quarter. It's approx 1 dollar a year on shares that cost 42 dollars.    
Approx 2.5% returns.    
    
If the stock stays flat also it's not worthwhile imo as market averages 10% a year.    
    
In my honest opinion viac is going to rise also though so you get a dividend and you get appreciation of share price so returns will be higher.    
    
Dividend companies normally drop in share price after issuing dividends also. Because cash is removed from the company and given to shareholders. So as a company they have less money so they're worth less (in theory it should drop by exactly 0.24 dollars on 15th June - but you get it in cash as a shareholder.)"
2021-05-28 16:19:44,stocks,"Yeah with 11 payments of 1.5493 (preferred hence fixed dividends) gives 17.04 dollars. (Ignoring time value of money)

Even If we take the higher conversion of VIACP to 1.17 VIAC shares, with VIAC at 42.42, this gives about 49.65.

So total is 49.65+17.04 = 66.67

VIACP is currently trading at 72.72. So doesnt seem to be worth the trouble, if anything else isn't missed"
2021-05-28 16:57:16,stocks,"I saw a comment on viac being kept below 42.5 today so many options expire worthless.

2021-05-28 13:45:48,stocks,"*unrealized losses. This is walnut level analysis, which you can see from S3 on their twitter. Their process is napkin math where they use mark-to-market losses from a rough guesstimation (heavy on guessing) of all short positions that haven't closed. 

Their numbers also don't add up for how they got outstanding float and just based on volume alone I have no idea how their numbers could be right

But even if their data is right, which it almost certainly isn't, and even if mark-to-market losses made sense, which they don't, the chance some hedgefund (or anyone) actually paid full ticket for these shorts can be roughly approximated as zero. The chance they are all going to close at this level of loss is zero. 

The biggest problem of all, however, is that there's no way to tell if the shorts are revolving or if they're the same shorts. For all we know the original shorts closed their position yesterday midday, and then doubled down (like this morning) to make oodles of cash when it crashed ~30%. S3 admits they have no idea, but then they just go ""fuck it"" and assume if the shares are shorted they must be maximally disadvantageous to short sellers.

The volume this morning alone was 150% of float. If they wanted to exit the market they could've. It's not a short squeeze when half the float is churning any given hour. 

So if it's not a short squeeze, and if they had an opportunity to exit, the remaining answer is short sellers believe they know something that the rest of the market -- here, retail investors -- don't know."

2021-05-28 13:00:35,stocks,"This is one reason a major short squeeze causes a general lifting of all short stocks. Short sellers, like everyone else, want to make money, and taking the opposite position, they are prone to the same sort of profit taking & sentiment based selling as the rest of the market. If you, as a bull trader, saw that a major blue chip stock - say, a bank - was collapsing, what would be your normal response? Probably to take profits and cut your over all exposure to the market. This is the exact same reaction faced by bear traders when they see a massive short squeeze - they'll buy to cover a bunch of their positions to take profits & reduce short exposure.

This leads to their respective short stocks going up as the artificial weight is lifted, which then attracts swing traders, adding to the momentum. And that becomes a major rally - not because of any underlying fundamental, but because of market forces."

2021-05-28 17:03:47,stocks,"People have been pointing at the 21 day cycle for the past two-three months. It’s based on measurable and public data (for the most part, ftds in foreign markets are not subject to the same transparency rules as they are in US markets).

At what point does that guy who predicted a rise in price on a specific day two weeks ago based on a certain set of criteria go from conspiracy theorist to “guy who’s right?” Honest question? Like say I predict the sun is going to come up tomorrow based on certain mathematical models suggesting the earth is spinning as it rotates around the sun in an elliptical orbit. I’m not a conspiracy theorist - that’s a testable hypotheses, and after measuring the results we can see the hypothesis to be the best explanation of why and how things happen when they do. If later on, it turns out that there’s a better explanation that gives more reliable results, we move over to that hypothesis as the best explanation. Pretty basic science right?

So if somebody comes along and says “hey, I think the shorts are hiding their positions in the options chains by creating synthetic long positions with married puts” it’s an acknowledged phenomenon, it’s recognized by regulatory experts, the sec, everybody knows it’s a thing. It’s not an “out there” theory. 

And then they say “I think there would be these signals that such is the case if this is true” and we look at the options chain and sure enough, they reflect exactly what the hypothesis suggested. And then the hypothesis goes on to state that if this is the case, based on established ftd times that are allowed for certain trading bodies like market makers, we should see a rise in price as they have to purchase a new round of shares to cover their old round of ftds in X timeframe. And sure enough, the price spikes reliably on that timeframe. 

At what point does this move from conspiracy theory to science? 

It’s no skin off my back. The truth is, those of us who have made buying and selling decisions based on this theory have made astronomical returns. I don’t really care if you as an investor decide to accept the hypothesis as truth, because the results will happen whether or not you choose to accept them. 

At this point, the short positions are utter dogshit, the type that will bankrupt them, and everybody in the industry knows it. So they won’t find a sucker to buy them. The best they can manage is to kick the can down the road. They’ll run out of runway eventually, and there’s no telling when that will be, but in the mean time, we can guess pretty accurately when the price will rise until they run out of runway. 

Are individual securities and wider economic shifts and corrections really just black magic that takes everybody by surprise? Or are there signals out there? How is it that some people seem to be able to say “I think the market is going to be bullish for these reasons” and be correct the large majority of the time, or somebody to say “I think we’re about to experience a major correction and downturn based on these other criteria” with frightening accuracy? Did Burry get lucky when he went all in on shorting mbs in 2006, and then held through massive unrealized losses until it turned out he was right? Or was it possible that he was right and all the people suggesting he was a conspiracy theorist were wrong all along? 

Like I said - no skin off my back. I’m up about 2800% for the year and that number is rising monthly - and I expect it to continue to rise. Whether or not anybody here decides “maybe they know something that I don’t” doesn’t stress me out even a little bit. I’m mostly just kinda scratching my head watching the hubris of this subreddit in thinking they have all the answers and that everybody is stupid except them, and wondering about what goes into that kind of mindset. 

But I suppose it’s normal for two companies to randomly jump 50% and 100%+ in a week on no news at all, and that it was simply a matter of retail fomoing in and pumping the price of these two random stocks up by billions in market cap. That’s probably a more reasonable explanation than “maybe these people know something I don’t.”

Among the sea of shitposts, memes, gain and loss porn, Wallstreetbets also has some of the best DD I have ever read. From $PRPL, to steel gang, to $GME and beyond, there has been a wealth of incredible DDs on WSB. Unfortunately, there are two issues with DD posted on WSB:

- It is easy to miss the high quality DD among the memes and shitposts
- Once a post has reached the front page and gained thousands of upvotes, the ticker being recommended may already have seen the implied vol on call options shoot up enormously. Sometimes, depending on the ticker, the popularity of a DD post may even move the stock price itself.

Given the wealth of information contained in these DD posts, it would be useful to have an alert system to inform whether a new DD post has been created, and particularly, one that is perceived to be of high enough quality to reach the front page through Reddit's upvote system. 

# My Solution: a Python WSB DD scraper and alert system

I built a Python tool that scrapes WSB every 5 minutes throughout the day and searches through posts which are flaired as ""DD"" and are 30-35 minutes old. Several pieces of information are extracted from those posts, such as their score, the authors' karma, average comment sentiment, as well as a couple engineered features. This information is stored in a dataframe which contains all the day's DD posts. The user can elect to receive email alerts if one of those DD posts reaches the front page (defined as the top 25 posts when sorted under ""Hot""). In addition, the user has the ability to include a model to predict which posts will reach the front page in advance based on the features being scraped. If included, the tool will send email alert when a post is scraped which has a high probability of reaching the front page.

If interested, you can access the code here:
https://github.com/CuriousByNature/WSBFrontPageAlert

The README has a full set of instructions for executing the code. The repository also comes with a sample model object trained to predict whether posts will reach the front page using only on one of my engineered features. The model is able to make predictions with just under 90% out-of-sample precision.

Expect BRK and Merck to do well if interest rates are raised for a sustained period of time at levels closer to historical averages.

Savings and Loans (Thrift): higher margins. May have to worry about steep drops in home prices.

Equity overall would be expected to suffer. Bonds might actually be attractive for the first time in my lifetime."

2021-05-28 18:18:32,stocks,"Generally speaking, if you want to build wealth on inflation, the best location is real estate. Though home sales slow, building costs go way up slowing down construction thus lowering supply.

But as they say, history doesnt always get it right. Right now things are a bit hazy. Supply is so ridiculously low that I am not sure inflation or deflation will slow the price hike down but at the same time, rents are going up and we are expecting a lot of evictions soon for residential. Commercial real estate is still struggling while healthcare/agricultural realty is booming.

I dont think the US has ever had such a big disparity between supply and demand in housing. If we have any stagflation experts maybe they can weigh in.

Other than real estate, anything hard asset based generally sees rev/earnings increase during inflation until prices settle but most of those have already climbed a lot already so you might be a bit late. Basic materials like wood, steel, chemicals etc are probably all high right now."
2021-05-28 18:26:35,stocks,"**1** Don't trade. It goes from growth to value from deflation to inflation. Listen, by the time you and I read headlines we are the last ones to read it. People who manage real money have predicted all this 3 months before based on their economic models and its all priced in already. You won't win this game. **2** Obviously then either buy and hold ETF or buy and hold solid companies. In terms of companies and perhaps answering your question avoid companies that have a lot of debt. Its all well and good having massive debt pile while interest rates are at 0. It's basically free money but in unlikely event that interest rates go up significantly those companies will get punished badly because they will have to spend their free cash flow on servicing debt with higher interest rate. So in summary, don't trade equities for metals and vice versa and avoid high debt zombies."

2021-05-28 19:25:05,stocks,"I think that Gold and Silver would not be great if they rise interest rates as increased interest rates tend to control inflation which is what boosts gold and silver (and any other commodity) in the first place.

Banks, insurance companies, mortgage companies and REITs, companies with a lot of cash on hand will also get some earnings boost (FB, AAPL, AMZN), companies with a lot of debt will likely fumble (there's a lot of them right now).

Not sure about dividend stocks, they're always kind of balanced apart from during high inflation. I guess the dividend premium over the risk-free rate would be lower so their valuation could drop a bit, but they're still good investments (as long as the business is doing well and the company is not debt-heavy).

Hope that helps 👍"

I could see this partnership helping WMT's stock (or at least their sales) if the home line items are more affordable than they would be in GAP's stores.

2021-05-28 00:00:00,stocks,"SPCE - next week in new exchange I’ll keep it simple. 
As of now the only way Russians can buy spce is from the St Petersburg exchange. St Petersburg is known to buy company stocks and re-sell them without the permission of the company… 

April 2018: 
“Under Russian securities laws, a Russian stock exchange can unilaterally admit foreign securities to trading without the consent of the issuer of such securities. In the last several years, the St. Petersburg Stock Exchange admitted securities of a number of foreign companies to trading in a similar fashion.”

So big investors don’t trade there for that reason.. they could be forced to sell their shares, and when they buy shares they have to pay “extra” on them. Our Russian friends always complain about the stock price, when they try to buy we post one number… they see another “higher to buy” lower to sell etc… because of a “delay”.

Anyways, if you noticed during the flight many Russian investors attended the after party of SPCE. Then days later SPCE announced they’ll officially list in the Moscow exchange. 

Is this a coincidence? No. Russian investors are interested in this company, next week we will see “fresh” money buying shares and holding them. 

We will see a difference, just watch!"
2021-05-28 14:08:58,stocks,"As a Russian-speaker I can confirm that SPCE is weirdly popular among Russian investors, it's everywhere - on YouTube, in Pulse (kind of an investors social network), etc. I do not know the reason, I think someone covered it at first, the others repeated, and now it's echo chambering all around"
2021-05-28 10:49:05,stocks,"When commentating with SuborbitalMark on SPCE week review during the last successful launch (5/22/21) on YouTube, it was crazy seeing how many Russian messages were zooming through the comments.

That's trading on speculation. And you think ""ooh a huge country"", but it's just one country, and it's russia. If they can't even get a broker to buy from nyse i wouldn't trust their ability to move a stock and **keep** it there. 

I bought RKT back in the day and sold same day, buy you gotta be sober and know when you're riding a PnD wave and jump off soon enough to not be exactly the kind of person they are trying to profit off of.

Such intra day flipping while betting on bad stuff happening is way different from actual investing. Still haven't heard any spaceships bringing any rich people to space, and when I do the stock will probably already have been priced to perfection for the longest time. Not really worth it.

2021-05-28 10:36:15,stocks,"yes this is true, options only trade until 4 PM but the 530 PM deadline matters. this is incredibly important for spreads as this is called pin risk. let's say you're short a 421/422 call spread. spy closes at 420.99 at 4 PM. at 5:29 PM EST, spy spikes to 421.01. Your short call will likely be exercised, but your long call will expire worthless, forcing you to be short 100 shares of spy but gaining 42,100 dollars. 

Now why is this bad? well let's say spy skyrockets to 425 the next trading day. Your original 100 max loss spread will now put you in a 4,000 dollar deficit if you cover your short shares."

# The Cash Flow Statement

The   main objective of the Cash Flow Statement (or Statement of Cash Flows)   is to explain how much and why the cash balance of a business changed   during the period of analysis.

**The cash flow statement is typically broken into three sections:**

* **Operating activities**
   * Detail   cash flow that’s generated once the company delivers its regular   goods  or services, and includes both revenue and expenses.
* **Investing activities**
   * Include   cash flow from purchasing or selling assets—think physical  property,   such as real estate or vehicles, and non-physical property,  like   patents—using free cash, not debt.
* **Financing activities**
   * Detail cash flow from both debt and equity financing.

>Based   on the cash flow statement, you can see how much cash different types   of activities generate, then make business decisions based on  your   analysis of financial statements.Ideally,  a company’s cash from  operating income should routinely exceed its net  income, because a  positive cash flow speaks to a  company’s ability to  remain solvent and  grow its operations.It’s  important to note that cash flow is different  from profit, which is why  a cash flow statement is often interpreted  together with other  financial documents, such as a balance sheet and  income statement.

**However, you will also find other information:**

* How much cash earnings the company had during the period, as contrasted with accrual earnings (in income statements)
* How much and where the company reinvested cash during the period to sustain and grow its business
* How much cash it raised from or returned to its debt and equity investors

The   Cash Flow Statement preserves the signs on cash flows, with negative   cash flows shown as minuses and positive cash flows as pluses. It also   looks at cash flows through the eyes of equity investors in the company.

**Positive cash flow**

* Indicates   that a company has more  money flowing into the business than out of  it  over a specified period.  This is an ideal situation to be in  because  having an excess of cash  allows the company to reinvest in  itself and  its shareholders, settle  debt payments, and find new ways  to grow the  business.
* Positive   cash flow does not necessarily translate to profit, however.  Your   business can be profitable without being cash flow-positive, and  you   can have positive cash flow without actually making a profit.

**Negative cash flow**

* Having **negative cash**   flow means your cash outflow is  higher than your cash inflow during a   period, but it doesn’t  necessarily mean profit is lost. Instead,   negative cash flow may be  caused by expenditure and income mismatch,   which should be addressed as  soon as possible.
* Negative   cash flow may also be caused by a company’s decision to  expand the   business and invest in future growth, so it’s important to  analyze   changes in cash flow from one period to another, which can  indicate how   a company is performing overall.

# Cash Flows from Operations

>***No images allowed on the sub, so here's a link:*** [**https://imgur.com/GEBa8Zy**](https://imgur.com/GEBa8Zy)

**Working Capital**

Embedded in the cash flow from operations is the **change in working capital items, excluding cash**

* Non-cash Working capital = Non-cash current assets – Non-debt current liabilities
* An   increase in non-cash working capital will decrease cash flows, whereas  a  decrease in non-cash working capital will increase cash flows.

Non-cash   working capital ties up cash and capital, a firm with higher needs for   that working capital will have lower cash flows from operations, for  any  given level of net income, than a firm with lower needs.

* The   investing activities section includes investments in both operating  and  non-operating assets, except for investment in liquid, close to   riskless securities, which is treated as cash & marketable   securities.
* The   investments into operating assets, whether internal (capex, net of   divestitures) or external (acquisitions of other companies) are the   engine that drives growth in the operating line items (revenues,   operating income etc.)

>*Note that acquisitions funded with stock will not show up here for obvious reasons.*

* The   investments into non-operating assets create a separate source of   value, where the payoff will not show up in the operating line items but   below the operating income line, as income from cross holdings or   securities.

# Cash Flows from Financing

**Debt Cash Flows**

* While   interest expenses show up in the operating cash flow section, by   reducing net income and showing up in deferred taxes, debt repayments   are part of the financing section.
* To   the extent that some or all of these debt repayments are funded with   debt issuance's, the net effect on cash flows can be neutralized or   become positive.

>**If   total debt increases during a period, it will represent a cash inflow,   and if it decreases, it will be a cash outflow. Companies that embark  on  plans to bring their debt down (up) over time should therefore  expect  these consequences.**

**Dividends and Buybacks**

* Until   the 1980s, the only cash flow that was received by equity investors in   publicly traded companies was dividends. The effect of paying  dividends  is simple: it reduces the cash balance of the company and  increases the  cash in the pockets of every shareholder who receives  dividends.
* Starting in the 1980s, US companies have returned increasing amounts to their shareholders in the form of buybacks.
   * The effect of buying back stock is exactly the same as paying dividends, to the company, with cash leaving the company.
   * For   shareholders, though, the cash flow effect is disparate. Those   shareholders who sell their shares back get cash from the company, and   those that do not get no cash, but get a larger share of the equity left   in the company.
   * Both dividends and buybacks reduce shareholder equity on the balance sheet.

2021-05-28 09:20:07,stocks,Really appreciate you taking the time to break this all down. I have been enjoying your series. Very easy to follow and understand!
2021-05-28 12:53:06,stocks,"u/oldworlds you are an absolute legend! Thank you for these mega posts, very very very informative. I’ve looked up these terms before and know how to interpret them, but your simple explanations of the real meaning and context of each part of a companies balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement will save me thousands over my lifetime honestly. Thank you for the most useful information I will ever get on Reddit!"
2021-05-28 12:47:19,stocks,I am on Session-5 of Prof. Damodaran's video series. It is such a gold mine of information! Its great that you have created these posts since that helps revisit some concepts again.
2021-05-28 00:00:00,stocks,"Lessons from an emotional investor/trader This is a reminder to all emotional investors/traders out there: Don't panic sell!

I made a bunch of stupid moves the week of May 10 when the market was taking its second downturn. If I just walked way from my computer for 2 weeks, most of the moves I made would have recovered. But unstead now I'm sitting on missed gains because I got too emotional.

Investing/trading is not about emotion. It's about having a plan and sticking to it.

I'm terrible at it because I still panic when macro factors test the strength of my plan.

Here are some of the lessons I'd like new traders/investors to really take to heart:

- When you buy a stock, have a VERY clear idea on why you bought, how long you're holding, and what your exit strategy is. I cannot stress this enough. There are many times where I bought a stock to flip, and I ended up holding it long term as a bag holder because I got greedy. And there are many times I bought stock I believed in, but ended up selling it on a correction because I panicked. Be incredibly regimented about this.

- Understand that corrections occur, and make a plan on how you'll deal with it. If you started buying high growth/beta stocks in January or February, you're account is probably down 20% from its peak. Thats okay, take a DEEP breath and think through your strategy. Did you leave any money to DCA your positions down? Ex. You bought ENPH at $220, its $140 right now. Do you still believe in ENPH? Why did you buy it at $220 and what has fundamentally changed about the company now that its at $140?

- Understand the power of averaging down.You can't time tops or bottoms. But you can make a strategy to mitigate risks. If any stocks you own have a beta higher than 2, seriously consider making an average down strategy. Averaging down is a very powerful tool, but you need to plan ahead for it. Stocks are great if they're only going up, but any high growth stock will come back down on small catalysts that throws into jeopardy their future growth. Those things can be macro factors as well such as interest rates and inflation fears. Here's a simple example using NIO. NIO was trading at $64 on January 20 after NIO day. There were definitely people who bought NIO at that price. Lets assume you bought 100 shares of NIO for $6400. NIO since then has been on a brutal slide. Its found its bottom at $31 twice now, but its still unclear what the real bottom is. At the same time, more analysts have reiterated that NIO is a buy with a price target of about $60. So your cost average is $64 with a 100 shares. NIO is sitting at $38 today. You know there's a 20% downside to $31, and maybe it goes lower. But you also know that it has a potential upside to $64. The reality is, if you believe in NIO, and were proactive enough to have $6400 stored in case of an event like this, if you bought 168 shares of NIO for $38, and averaged down your position you're cost average for NIO become a much more reasonable $47 rather than $64. That means NIO only has to gain 20% from its current price rather than 80%. I've seen this written in this subreddit before, but averaging down on a position is one the greatest opportunities. It lets you recommit to the original thesis you had for a stock, and it also creates a more advantageous position in the long term.

That said, be careful of ""buy the dip"". Understand why the dip is occurring. Compare the dip to macro factors like SPY and QQQ. Understand interest rates, inflation, international trade deals and other factors that could affect macro price movement. Use TA to understand support levels, and always be aware that things could drop more. April and May really tested the theory of ""it can't go any lower"". I was reading on this forum that April 27 was the end. That everything was going to recover since high flying stocks were on their bullish trajectory. Then we hit an inflation panic and the market corrected all high growth stocks by about 20%. OUCH.



Here's my big mistake. When I had no extra money to average down, and the stocks kept falling in May, I panicked. I managed to make it through February and March and most of April without panicking and selling. But May did me in. I ended up selling stocks to preserve capital, and most of those stocks are rebounding now and its making me realize that I wasn't as mentally strong as I thought.

Don't make these mistakes I did. Please make a strategy for yourself and stick with it! And don't keep changing strategies on a whim. That's another thing that will lead to compounding losses rather than tweaking and honing your strategy for what works for you!"
2021-05-28 09:15:58,stocks,If you panic it might be possible that you are investing more than you can afford to lose. If you want to play safe just invest into some ETF like MSCI World or at least make it the bigger part of your portfolio. Then you won't be bothered that much when your individual stocks take hits.
2021-05-28 08:42:39,stocks,"If you read this subreddit and didn’t absorb this commonly held advise stated by experienced traders around here, what makes you think someone else will read this and change their behavior?

I’ve been advocating less emotional trading here for years, but it seems like it’s getting worse not better.  A lot of that stems from the culture that the young (loud) people who are piling into investing subreddits acting like they’re hot shit.  They seem to think they are different and somehow morally Better than those who came before them.  It seems like they think the power of the Bern lets them see capitalism for what it really is!  And they’ll do it better because they understand the game the Fed is playing, while everyone else is being sheep!

No.  The hard part of investing is holding on to your ass when you suffer a 50% paper loss.  No one is too smart to suffer this, and what separates good traders from bad is how you react to the pressure cooker.  Comes with experience, and knowing what information to filter out.  If you’re new, you should just assume you don’t have this and assume you suck and pick a strategy that takes this assumption into account."

2021-05-28 08:56:52,stocks,"Totally agree! I knew I was bad at stocks from day one, but when my portfolio grew 30% over January, I thought I had figured it out. I was wrong, and the bear performance of my portfolio from February through May is reinforcement that I don't know shit.

Reading and learning are different than experiencing and adapting. I'm still learning from my failures, and the challenge I had was that I didn't stick to my strategy. Things that I am still working on personally:

- creating a cost average down strategy

- not looking at account value as be all and end all

- creating a mental strategy that any high flying stock is actually 50% of its value at any one time

 > No. The hard part of investing is holding on to your ass when you suffer a 50% paper loss. No one is too smart to suffer this, and what separates good traders from bad is how you react to the pressure cooker.

Yes, suffering a 50% paper loss is brutal. I think seeing the game-ification of my stock portfolio has warped my mind to a min/max style of behaviour. Which is a great way to get eaten by the market.

The last element that really hurt me is benchmarking. I didn't do good benchmarking, which means I didn't know how to take gains off the able when I was up, and also I cut losses after being oversold instead of averaging down and waiting for a revision back to the mean in my favourable direction.

Sorry if this post frustrated you, but I'm just trying to communicate my challenges and hope that it can help at least one more person. But you're probably right, it won't."
2021-05-28 15:51:42,stocks,"> No. The hard part of investing is holding on to your ass when you suffer a 50% paper loss. 

No. The hard part of investing is not to buy garbage stock you see on social media, especially Reddit. This is especially true for the last 6 months."
2021-05-28 10:31:40,stocks,"YES!!!!

My lazy friends that just forget about their portfolios have outperformed me, who does constant research and is looking for optimal entries and exits. They just buy and forget about it. We compare performance and they've beaten me hands down. They've even played crazy risky stuff, and have still outperformed my tinkering. Feels bad man...."
2021-05-28 08:58:39,stocks,"Yes, exit strategies are good. I think a good strategy is to use a VOO holding in your portfolio as a benchmark and hedge. When your highflying stocks are outperforming VOO, take some money off the table and rebalance into VOO. If your high flying stocks are underperforming VOO, consider moving some VOO to buy those stocks at a discount.

Use VOO as a volatility hedge, and benchmark to see if you can really beat a broad spectrum index.

I've learned that I can beat it with luck in the short term. But in the long term I tend to lose to VOO."

Great work on just staying the course! Just remember that keeping extra cash on hand is valuable. Whether thats from income or selling to lock in gains or sell CC/CSPs, either way, its always valuable to have some cash on hand to average down if things go down the shitter."

Good on you for learning so quickly!"
2021-05-28 00:00:00,stocks,"What is this (nonsense) candlestick pattern? (Bullish without engulfings)? I recently learnt about bullish and bearish engulifings and then opened the 5 minute chart / the daily chart / weekly chart etc in order to study them further. However, I'm surprised that there are plenty of times when engulfings are ignored or change the trend negligibly.

More surprisingly I constantly see this pattern repeated over and over and over again. In fact, this pattern repeats like 80% of the time and engulfings are the other 20% of the times I would say.

[https://imgur.com/a/GSCdXvQ](https://imgur.com/a/GSCdXvQ)

In this image we see 3 times the same thing - bullish without any engulfings.

Are these actually a valid candlestick pattern?"
2021-05-28 09:50:01,stocks,"First of all, those aren't really engulfings.  A true bullish engulfing contains the prior candle completely within its body.  That's why it's called engulfing, because it engulfs the prior candle.  What you have in that picture are examples of plain old bull candles.

Second, you can't use candlesticks by themselves without considering the broader context.  Bullish candles and patterns are more likely to fail in the context of a downtrend, for example.

Third, volume is also an important consideration.  A bull candle on much higher than average volume is a much stronger signal than a bull candle on weak volume."
2021-05-28 08:21:35,stocks,"At its heart, consider what an engulfing candle is. Really it just means volatility is increasing, and the pattern is that it is likely to increase in the direction of the candle. But volatility increasing in itself doesn’t necessarily mean big price action."
2021-05-28 17:28:44,stocks,I’d also say timeframe is a factor. There’s a lot more room for random “noise” on a 5 min chart than a 30 min or Day chart.
2021-05-28 12:21:36,stocks,"I get what you're saying. We can keep an eye on volume and there are plenty of times when these kind of trend reversals happen even without significant volume. 

The broader context of a trend doesn't fit in either because these little shits have the power to change the entire trend. In small dips and bumps it slowly steers the price to a completely different direction. It's irritating as well because you can never guess at any second whether that would be the last little step.

I wish a can of worms on the butts of the people who place their orders in such a way so as to cause a steady, slow movement of the price. I don't know what they gain out of it.

You're right about the engulfings. Those aren't. Which is exactly why it's confusing. These little critters are so frequent and doesn't seem like candlestick is the way to determine them."
2021-05-28 12:24:02,stocks,I don't know. It's very strange. The first candle is a big tower of penance. And that is followed by a slow incline that you never see coming. Why? Why isn't that big tower there in the next few candles few mins. Instead repeats again after 15 mins. And I cannot figure either of those out. Fuck.
2021-05-28 12:45:53,stocks,"What I'm saying is you have to look at the big picture.

A candlestick on its own is just a candlestick.  That's why most of candlestick charting is about recognizing candlestick patterns, not just single candlesticks.  But then you have to see how the pattern fits into the larger context.  For example, a random hammer candle in the midst of a downtrend without any other signals is just a random hammer candle.  But if that same candle appears at a key level of support, or touches a lower trendline, and comes with twice the average volume, then you have a potential reversal signal."
2021-05-28 12:36:49,stocks,"Supply and demand has a delay. The price drops, lots of buyers are willing to pay the new price, and that slowly brings the price back up as demand increases over the next few candles. If you have 15 people willing to buy something for $1 that come into your store through the day, the first five get to pay $1, then at lunch you can raise the price to $1.50 and still bet to sell to another 5 buyers, close to closing you see great business and raise to $2. But that took all day."

Already at a 41B market cap and celebrating a $111M contract win like it makes them the next SpaceX makes me really wonder what people see in this aspiring defense company as an investment."

2021-05-28 16:31:11,stocks,$PLTR! Time to ride! This is going to be huge. Bought some contracts at the close.

2021-05-28 09:01:05,stocks,So its going to drill today. Got it. That seems to be what happens anytime anything related to pltr is announced
2021-05-28 15:13:45,stocks,"$24 and then down, see you again at $20"
2021-05-28 10:46:13,stocks,And it is going down.
2021-05-28 08:40:23,stocks,Hell yea. Was hoping they would drop any sort of good news during this bull run
2021-05-28 12:11:45,stocks,The stock: 📉
2021-05-28 14:11:13,stocks,Aaaaaaand it’s down 3000%
2021-05-28 14:21:44,stocks,Great news! And I’m sure this will result in another 5% dip!

2021-05-28 08:27:56,stocks,"Wondering the same, but it's 111m for a 1 year contract it seems so that's big if this renews every year"
2021-05-28 09:01:17,stocks,Looks like the annual amount is in the 50's so more like 5% of revenue.  Definitely positive that it's almost all software and not services.

You sure about that? One big issue with PLTR is their dependence on fed contracts. High volume of smaller contracts with private business is what everyone is hoping for."
2021-05-28 12:58:22,stocks,"> Wondering if it's a renewal  

""selected ... to continue its work"""
2021-05-28 15:30:31,stocks,Seems to just be a continuation and not an increased effort. Need new contracts outside US DOD to show growth.
2021-05-28 12:10:13,stocks,I look forward to the 3-5% drop.
2021-05-28 09:56:48,stocks,Why do they accept those? Is it for better data? Hoping to increase those contracts?
2021-05-28 08:13:02,stocks,That is the best situation you can ask for in a stock though. For it to keep improving its fundamentals while share price goes down. You are then able to keep loading up as the bears attack the stock and try to use FUD. Because once FUD goes away things can turn quickly on the upside.
2021-05-28 07:58:24,stocks,Because it was hella overpriced back in January
2021-05-28 09:25:07,stocks,Maybe that should tell you something about how grossly overpriced it was last winter.
2021-05-28 09:43:58,stocks,"It got memed to hell and pumped up really quickly. I didn't buy at $9 then it exploded on reddit to $20. That's when I bought since everyone was talking about it and it shot up 50% more.

I think there was too much hype around it the price shot up too fast. There was also a bunch of insider selling. 

I'm not worried since it's a long term hold for me so I've been adding shares every now and then. It's still up over 100% since its listing which is insane."

2021-05-28 08:09:15,stocks,It directly listed at $9 less than a year ago and is at like $24 today. Almost tripling your money in just over 6 months. Must suck to be horrible at this whole investing thing huh?

2021-05-28 13:14:38,stocks,Yeah its weird you can be in business for 17 years and not make any money... wonder why all this good news isn’t sending it to the moon
2021-05-28 19:33:01,stocks,This is the _best_ thing that could happen to them. And it's only $110m in revenues. A business has to ultimately have a path to profits.

2021-05-28 16:58:33,stocks,Did you see the rally happen 9 hours ago? It ended up closing at a blistering 1%
2021-05-28 10:59:13,stocks,Probably that 111 million is a combination of services and licenses. I’d imagine some of it would be reoccurring but probably not all.
2021-05-28 17:21:42,stocks,[here](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210528005069/en/Palantir-Awarded-111m-Contract-to-Provide-Mission-Command-Platform-for-the-United-States-Special-Operations-Command) it says at the end of the first paragraph that it’s one year and one option year. i don’t know what that actually means but it sounds like after the first year they’re going to reassess
2021-05-28 17:22:19,stocks,"It's actually a 1 year contract for half that amount, with an option year for the other half.

As government contracts go, that's a fairly short option period."
2021-05-28 14:59:56,stocks,I think it’s for 5 option years. They may not get the full 111
2021-05-28 12:23:23,stocks,"I don see that, please share the quote. I see they have an existing relationship but this could be a new contract aka 10% additional revenue not accounted for in previous financial statements."
2021-05-28 13:30:43,stocks,"I was referring to small gov contracts, and no just my guess."
2021-05-28 13:33:39,stocks,"Right but you can continue work/relationships with a new contract, an expanded contract, or with a renewal of an existing contract. That's what I'm wondering. If they made 1b last year, how much of it was from this work/agreement and how much of the $111m is going to look more like growth on the books"
2021-05-28 10:17:12,stocks,Why do they accept customer purchase orders? Because it's revenue and profit.
2021-05-28 10:21:48,stocks,You have to read between the lines. It is expected that US defense spending is going to increase next year. Just look at LMT raising their guidance. So PLTR probably signed this deal so when this one expires they can get more on a renew.
2021-05-28 08:34:53,stocks,">That is the best situation you can ask for in a stock though. 

For a stock you don't hold personally."
2021-05-28 16:30:44,stocks,Mmmm pretty sure the best situation you could ask for is for it to only go up after you buy it.

2021-05-28 17:06:41,stocks,That’s actually not true. I’m a big PLTR fan but one of the biggest red flags when it comes to holding a stock is negative price movement on positive news
2021-05-28 10:57:27,stocks,Yep. All this stuff was already being factored into the share price. FOMO led a lot of people to buy in early with the hope of these contracts working out in their favor.
2021-05-28 08:11:27,stocks,"Well yes, but only a handful of people got that $9 price. Like $20 Tesla. Back then only a few of their shares were even trading. I got in at $13 but back then it was a crapshoot, we had no earnings track record so it’s not like most people would’ve drop big on them."

2021-05-28 13:52:49,stocks,"bro how are you investing but you dont know the basics of a Roth IRA or 401K?  seriously do yourself a favor and google it, no one here is going to sit here and break down how these retirement account works. it's also not a simple answer (59.5 years of age but with several asterisks)"
2021-05-28 16:27:43,stocks,Yes holding until I’m 60 lol
2021-05-28 09:24:30,stocks,I did the same exact thing...

The market just really knows how to turn the knife."
2021-05-28 09:15:33,stocks,"I mean, if they aren't getting contracts then they literally aren't making any money. Contracts are less frequent, but no less routine than Apple selling an iPhone. It's just ""Company Sells Stuff"" as an excuse to make threads about the stock."

2021-05-28 08:56:11,stocks,Definitely. But i think 110 millions is a bit much just for software. The army is just overspending here (and let's not talk about possible corruption)
2021-05-28 17:00:16,stocks,"I did. Not worried. Looks like wall street over sold on calls. Got flat footed at 24.5+, went short in order to force it down below 23 and avoid most of the hit."
2021-05-28 11:11:24,stocks,"Yeah, implementation is almost certainly included in that fee. Most SaaS companies don't make a ton of money on implementation though, so it shouldn't be a gigantic amount."
2021-05-28 16:29:27,stocks,It says 1 year and 1 year option in the article though
2021-05-28 12:37:37,stocks,The first sentence states that PLTR has been chosen by USSOCOM to **continue** its work as their enterprise data management and AI-enabled mission command platform as part of the Mission Command System/Common Operational Picture program.
2021-05-28 10:17:55,stocks,They have huge customer acquisition costs so no it isn't profit when they are small contracts
2021-05-28 08:50:51,stocks,"The point is to keep buying when it's cheap, so that you can reap the rewards when it eventually skyrockets. Not hard to understand people."
2021-05-28 12:51:21,stocks,"This is an extremely short-term perspective.  Holding stock, in general, probably isn't the right strategy for someone this short-term minded anyway."
2021-05-28 18:35:33,stocks,Keep buying. If you liked the stock at a higher price you should absolutely love it at current prices.

2021-05-28 17:02:02,stocks,I still got a contract out. Expires in like 80-90 days so I’m holding out seeing what happens
2021-05-28 11:20:08,stocks,Yeah you lose money on services to jack up that sweet reoccurring. I can’t imagine how long a 100 million implementation would take though.
2021-05-28 11:45:49,stocks,Palantir loses a ton of money on implementation usually.
2021-05-28 19:05:07,stocks,That’s really good.
2021-05-28 19:05:26,stocks,Do you know if it was contested
2021-05-28 11:25:48,stocks,"You may be right but I'll just say customer acquisition cost is often stated as an average, including the giant customers. More likely it's a percentage of contract, they wouldn't spend 50m to get a 5m deal of they don't expect it to grow drastically. They prob have high cost but given they aim to move more into software and less services, the margin should still be good"
2021-05-28 09:55:33,stocks,"The hard part is to determine if and when the stock is cheap.  It is not like there is a MSRP marking lable slap on the stock.

So yeah, it is hard."

Just asking out of curiosity, after all if it's bound to explode soon then it ought ot be easy to *time the market*. Unless whatever you mean is common knowledge and gebce priced in."
2021-05-28 09:56:26,stocks,"Yeah, that doesn’t make it any less stressful when it drops."
2021-05-28 12:54:00,stocks,I think you analysis is off. Plenty of people with a long term focus get stressed about sharp drops. This is often a reaction they have no control over.
2021-05-28 18:37:32,stocks,That’s fine for people with more funds to put in.
2021-05-28 10:37:05,stocks,One year worth of data is great for YOY analysis.
2021-05-28 11:46:59,stocks,The same CEO who drinks in meetings and runs around the office with a Katana

Not everyone is SpaceX with a CEO that designs and builds and flies the rockets himself...."

2021-05-28 08:59:58,stocks,"Bought 1,000 between $11-13. I now have 10k shares but about 30% were purchased by selling covered calls."
2021-05-28 14:09:04,stocks,"Alright, I'll try and summarize:  

In a Roth IRA, every dollar that you put in (you already paid income tax on). You can withdraw all of the amount you put in (Contributions) at any time, no fees, no penalties, no questions asked. But the GAINS in your Roth IRA is the portion that you can start withdrawing at age 59.5. If you try to withdraw earlier than that, you will pay tax&penalty.  However, there are a few exceptions that you can withdraw early, such as when you're a first time home buyer. Also you can withdraw money early from your 401K through your Roth IRA (kind of a loophole, called Roth IRA conversion ladder), but that's a bit more complex.  

Overall, a Roth IRA is one of the absolute best financial vehicles you can have, and I highly recommend maxing it out every single year, and not to withdraw an (even the original amounts you put in). Lemme know if you have any questions..  

To answer your question: you can withdraw every penny that you PUT IN to your Roth at ANYTIME with NO fees/penalties/restrictions at all. Just like a regular checking account. Only the GAINS are subject to restrictions.  However, I dont recommend withdrawing any amount because once you withdraw, you cant put it back in. And your annual amount you can contribute in a Roth is only $6000."
2021-05-28 10:28:42,stocks,"It's 50m+ (option year, priced inclusive of options means that's the price for 2 years), but it's still just fairly useless information since it isn't comparative. You could lose 150m of contracts and gain 50m in a month and the only news would be gaining 50m of contracts because the company that got the ones you lost would be on the other headlines.

Not saying the company isn't doing well, but this is in all honesty just a circlejerk of a popular stock."
2021-05-28 17:03:48,stocks,I think you'll be okay. I am decent at charting and the chart looks promising as long as market conditions hold. We should be at the start of the 2nd $PLTR rally. The 1D+ MACD is pulling up towards a cross over. OBV has also cross it's average and is showing accumulation. CMF reaching towards positive. Literally could happen as soon as next week. I expect it to happen within a month.

Eg

I pay my consultants 1 million dollars to implement

2021-05-28 09:04:52,stocks,"I never said soon. I invest long term. It may skyrocket tomorrow, or it may skyrocket in 5 years. The point is it's a rapidly growing company with strong fundamentals. Unless these fundamentals change, there is 100% certainty that the stock will grow in the long term."

2021-05-28 16:43:34,stocks,No so apparently. Usually there are several stages. Very high chances for next year multi mln $ contract for PLTR.
2021-05-28 13:01:30,stocks,What do you think the customer acquisition cost is on continued work?
2021-05-28 19:56:06,stocks,Palantir isn't early stage anything. They've been around for 18 years and pull in 1B+ in revenue annually.

2021-05-28 13:44:18,stocks,"I agree. Except every time I buy the dip, it dips even more.  I'm out of money to buy dips now.  haha."
2021-05-28 13:43:33,stocks,Wow.  Reddit investor hero saying financial analysis is easy.  ROFL.
2021-05-28 09:27:13,stocks,"That's true unless it is already way overpriced (because of hype or because of artificial demand caused by short interest or something else). I'm not saying it is, I don't know, but it's definitely possible for a stock to improve it's fundamentals, go down in price and still be overvalued."
2021-05-28 09:06:53,stocks,Damn I replied the same thing but with different words.
2021-05-28 14:36:23,stocks,Is 3 months supposed to be a long time for you?
2021-05-28 10:48:14,stocks,"I don’t think anyone thinks it’s the next GME- no one is trying to squeeze it as far as I’m aware.

Most people just believe it’s a good longterm play, which is clearly a sentiment shared by smart money as hedge funds bought a ton of shares in Q1."
2021-05-28 13:05:44,stocks,"Well I think we agree in that case then, as my point was that seeing short term drops causes stress to long term holders."
2021-05-28 19:12:44,stocks,Yes. But there has to be a limit to funding too. This could be the 18th time someone has loaded up on PLTR dips.

2021-05-28 17:26:56,stocks,Honestly no idea. But PLTR has gross margins in the high 70s so I'd say pretty low

2021-05-28 19:51:53,stocks,"That's not the point. The point is that this and other subs are overly saturated with posts about Palantir, and I suspect the only reason is that people are trying to pump up the stock like they've been doing with Gamestop stock the past 6 months."
2021-05-28 13:14:18,stocks,"That isn't what you said.  You disagreed that it's the ""best situation"" for those holding the stock.

What could be better than a discount based on a disconnect between fundamentals and perceived value for someone who has a long-term view of the stock?  IF YOU UNDERSTAND YOUR INVESTMENT, a little short-term sweating isn't going to change your evaluation of the position.

The only reason short-term disconnects would matter to you is if you're playing the short-term game, or if you just don't understand your investment.  Neither of these cases is really relevant, and the latter is hardly holding up as a valid state of mind."

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

Really shows how dangerous it is investing in consumer cyclicals if your primary research is what people on internet forums are saying.

2021-05-28 09:56:10,stocks,"Nice time for AMD wake back up, it's just in time for most of my less volatile holdings to be inexplicably red."
2021-05-28 10:17:09,stocks,Im surprised there is so much green right before a three day weekend. Thought this the time people take profits due to FUD surrounding three day weekends.
2021-05-28 10:49:57,stocks,Why A M C going up and G M E is down? Generally it follows G M E..
2021-05-28 12:00:26,stocks,I forgot Tencent paid dividends until I saw it as a pending in my account today. Even when it's so small it doesn't matter I like the annual/semi-annual dividends.
2021-05-28 12:02:07,stocks,"Asking for an explanation:

One of the key elements of meme stock ""squeezing"" is, supposedly, the voter count that will revealed for AMC and GME in the next 1-2 weeks. According to pro-squeeze DD's the voter count will exceed the total amount of shares, thereby proving that naked shorts exist in large numbers - setting up the conditions for a squeeze.

Why can this only be found out after votes are counted? Do AMC it GameStop really not know how many vote requests are sent out? It seems really odd to me that there's no way to know how many requests are sent out and you just have to wait and see how many votes you get back."
2021-05-28 12:08:53,stocks,"Am I right for staying with Ferrari (NYSE: RACE) because I have faith in the commercial success of the Purosangue? I cannot say I've been terribly impressed with the stock so far, otherwise. I'm really just betting on the Purosangue at this point."
2021-05-28 12:21:53,stocks,"Thanks Obama.
Amd finally bumping. Reduced position a bit to secure profit."
2021-05-28 15:04:11,stocks,"I'm finally back above my cost basis for PLTR as of today. I have confidence that the company is competent and I believe they make great products and will accomplish great things.   
  
The only thing that concerns me is its market cap. Is it really worth $43 billion? And does it have the potential to be worth hundreds of billions?"
2021-05-28 15:52:41,stocks,I already bought a handful of AMC for $10 awhile back. Is it worth buying more now at $25 or should I just stick with what I already have?
2021-05-28 15:55:28,stocks,And here comes the Friday afternoon sell off.
2021-05-28 10:00:52,stocks,Is there any point in things like DD anymore when the stock market is just a dart board at this point
2021-05-28 10:26:20,stocks,Buying dirt cheap puts on AMC this morning might’ve been the smartest thing I’ve ever done

2021-05-28 10:01:34,stocks,I appreciate everyone buying AMC so they can avoid bankruptcy I enjoy going to a movie once a year.
2021-05-28 07:10:58,stocks,"Bought a whole bunch of AMC at $6, sold at $15 a while back. Taking every ounce of willpower not to FOMO into what's going on right now. Never know with this and GME, last time GME went on a massive soar to 300+ and then suddenly dropped $80 in like a second, and kept dropping all the way down to $70. It's the wild west over there."

2021-05-28 08:07:17,stocks,"I am not sure anything is going to matter today besides the weekly options expiring games unless month end rebalancing hasn’t been completed already.

If so, today is just about over already and really was over at night as well."

2021-05-28 10:44:06,stocks,"Bought some DKNG at 58 a month ago, before it tanked to 40 and I was too afraid to buy more. Is it now too late to get in on the dip?"
2021-05-28 10:51:19,stocks,"Holy snap to think it'd keep spiking, sold half my AMC at $25 yesterday, then half my the gaming version of it at $240, the other big one is also finally sold all my BB at $12, I've been wanting to exit that one, the one I least believed in, woke up to see my sell limits activate this morning and was thinking holy snap the market must actually be really good today."

2021-05-28 14:09:38,stocks,"I am paralyzed with indecision. Took a bunch of profits yesterday and today and have no idea where to put things. Made good $ off CRM options, but kinda hesitant to buy the stock."
2021-05-28 14:13:59,stocks,"Does anyone know why RILY gave an extra dividend? 

According to fidelity they announced a $0.50 div per to be paid today. I have 15 shares so i got $7.50 today but there was a 2nd dividend also received today for $37.50. Can anyone tell me where this came from?"
2021-05-28 16:02:12,stocks,"Probably was some late rebalancing there. Oh well.

For most of the day the only thing that mattered was indeed the weekly options expiring and 420 was almost nailed on SPY.

Looks like we did NOT get the lower low that I was wondering if whether we'd get on the VIX."
2021-05-28 16:05:58,stocks,How did ya’ll end today?
2021-05-28 16:18:29,stocks,"Not only did I did not get the lower low that I wanted to see on the VIX, it's going to settle positively.

Sigh, oh well, lol, it still did what it needed to this month to lead to potential upside in the major averages in June, as it had closed bullishly for May (so the chop that happened isn't a surprise). But even with it being positive today, it closed with a massive rejection on the monthly.

I ended up gaining for May. I'll take it given what happened in the middle of the month!"
2021-05-28 16:19:50,stocks,Well damn. 5/5 days this week where my individual stock portfolio finished green. Very modestly the past 2 days but still feels good

2021-05-28 10:58:47,stocks,Sold PLTR at 24.21 to make back the $10k I lost in ARKK. Going to wait until next week to reinvest in something. Just glad I didn't try to ride out ARKK for the next 5 years.
2021-05-28 09:23:07,stocks,I FOMO hard on AMC but it's throwaway money so I hope it pays off
2021-05-28 09:28:33,stocks,"Oh great, yet another day of seeing unbelievable gains that’ll take me years to get, from pos meme stocks while my real portfolio loses money or if lucky snatches a whole giant 1%. Yippee"
2021-05-28 13:40:46,stocks,Mods allow 1 billion post about which stock it’s gonna 10 times in a month but won’t let me post a question about utility stocks real cool 😎
2021-05-28 18:37:53,stocks,Was buying into COIN a massive mistake? Do we see any hope at all in it not continuing to collapse?
2021-05-28 06:31:10,stocks,"It's silly to feel bad after taking profit yesterday, but I sold AMC after it spiked cuz I was worried about a pre-market rugpull and crash. The slight dip in after hours yesterday made me feel kinda glad too.

Who would've thought it would already run up 20% in premarket wtf... 

Fighting the urge to FOMO back in, but at least it being up so much makes it actually harder to justify jumping back in. This looks prime for a crash on open tho when everyone rushes to take profit."
2021-05-28 05:40:34,stocks,"Whats your opinion on CD Project?
After the terrible Cyberpunk Release the stock just kept dropping.
But I think with new updates for the game and the Witcher IP I think its a great long term play for a currently cheap price."

2021-05-28 08:02:26,stocks,What companies are building out EV infrastructure? With Ford releasing their ev truck and the numerous other cSR companies releasing their Evs and hybrids electric charging infrastructure needs to get built out. So who’s doing that building? Is anyone buying up space to put charging stations and generating rent off that like reit’s? Where and how. An I get exposure to this segment.

2021-05-28 16:06:27,stocks,How about ONDAS?
2021-05-28 06:21:57,stocks,SoFi (IPOE) merger was approved yesterday.. Ticker change to SOFI on Tuesday.  Massive short squeeze likely today.. the borrow fee for short shares is now 260% (unhead of).. you can check it out on iborrowdesk. There are literally almost no shares left to short to try mounting a defense.. and shorts are on their last leg after spending so much ammo the past two days trying to keep price below $20.   expect a Huge jump at some point today!
2021-05-28 06:27:15,stocks,"Serious question, Is AMC a real short squeeze? I don't understand why shorts have to cover when the share price is so high? Why can't they just wait it out? Do they always get margin called? can't they just work something out? It's just a matter of time before it drops."

2021-05-28 06:13:57,stocks,"I think AMC is more likely to squeeze than drop and right now it very well could be at the 40 dollar point gme was at in January. Main reason I'm not buying is because I FOMOd into GME, lost 1500 and am completely done with ""short squeezes"". 

Also it's market manipulation. Just because Wall Street and congressmen do it doesn't make it okay to do so.

Got 400 dollars in my account I'm spending on T. Am bullish on it even with the dividend cuts. The company can make much better use of the money."
2021-05-28 10:30:28,stocks,"Trimmed some AAPL and picked up some QCOM. 

AAPL p/e is getting swole (28!) and it's been losing steam in general. One analyst downgraded with a price target below $100. I only sold a portion to take profits and It's still a good peice of my portfolio.

Bought QCOM with the cash and brought my price down a little bit. I recently bought near ATH and it looks like it's got support at this price. p/e of 19 is much better.

2021-05-28 08:15:22,stocks,"Who is jumping into AMC today? Seeing some people enjoy 45-55% gains in a few hours yesterday makes it seem mighty tempting. Of course, my arms aren't strong enough to be a bag holder."

2021-05-28 09:15:34,stocks,"Is Nokia a ""memestock""? 

I bought in because of the recent contracts and their steady pivot in business model. Idk if what's happening now is AMC hype spilling over or people actually deciding it's undervalued. 

The curve yesterday looked very similar to AMC, just smaller margins, but idk any actual fundamentals."
2021-05-28 09:21:44,stocks,"I wouldn't say there was no reaction to Core PCE but if it had actually mattered today, you would have seen a big gap down.

So, in the major averages at least, still looks likely that the main thing that's going to matter is the weekly OPEX.

Inflation may suddenly matter again in a couple weeks however, in fact I'll be surprised if it doesn't."

2021-05-28 10:03:09,stocks,"Would it make sense to buy shares of a company I like before ex-dividend date, with intentions of selling the day after? Do dividend stocks fall on ex dividend day, essentially wiping out any chances of that gain?"

2021-05-28 10:56:38,stocks,Thoughts on SPCE? I like them long term but the recent price gain kinda makes me want to sell them very back in later. I’m not in for much so it’s not a big deal either way.

2021-05-28 08:29:48,stocks,"It works both ways though.  A higher gbp/usd rate means more buying power if you're adding in every month.

I've got a 20-30 year time frame and plan on adding every month to sp500 and world tracking etfs.  For me, it may be a bit of short term pain as the exchange rate rises, but it means I can buy more with my GBP each month.  The hope would be a very strong pound for the next 28 years, then if the dollar could strengthen in the last 2 thatd be perfect.

Even If it never weakens, the market will outpace the exchange rate.  From Jan 1, the exchange rate has lost you about 4% (1.365/1.420).  Sp500 is up 11% in that same time.

If you're doing a lot of short term trading, it does make it more challenging.  Best advice is to just invest in long terms stuff for now if you think the rate will keep moving against you."

It's an investment company that trades well above the book value of assets with a 90 year old CEO, and I'd argue that a large part of why it trades above the value of assets is because of who the CEO is. It's a well run company but there's a tradeoff between safety and upside in my opinion.

2021-05-28 09:19:40,stocks,I just bought yesterday after dumping it earlier this month. I really like this stock
2021-05-28 11:23:20,stocks,Meme link for sure
2021-05-28 13:01:47,stocks,"Also keep in mind a few of the recent news items. MO dropped a month or so back on news that Biden wants to legislate lower nicotine content. Obviously that hasn’t passed or even been introduced yet but if it does pass could effect them. It’s why MO went from $52 to $47, although it’s been recovering nicely. 

Second, while I agree on the weed play, keep in mind it’s under anti-trust review from the FTC because of the large interest it acquired in JUUL (the weed play). I assume if they lose they will have to divest themselves of JUUL and we lose our covert weed play to some degree, though I still think MO will get involved after federal legalization. 

In short, if you are okay with those risks, then it’s a good buy in price now and has potential later with weed legalization, but those are some decent sized risks. 

I have a small position ~1% of portfolio. Happy to hold and see what it does while collecting my 7% divs"
2021-05-28 13:07:06,stocks,Bti is a better choice according to the actual valuation of both imo
2021-05-28 14:28:39,stocks,"I owned MO but sold for a small profit.  They're being stubborn about dividends and buybacks when really I would have like to seem them be more aggressive with IQOS (heat-not-burn) and cannabis wherever possible.  They look like they aren't gaining much of anything there and meanwhile tobacco sales are declining and in jeopardy (as a US-based company).

As /u/CraftyImplement said, I prefer BTI because they're better value, they have worldwide exposure (emerging markets have smoking rates going up), and they have cannabis investments, too."

DD will help you invest into things that in the distance future will pay off well for you. These past 4 months if anything have shown me just how important it is to do homework first and try stick to a strategy cause there’s many things that will happen on a day by day basis that will mess with your head. 

Find the stuff you’ll have the easiest time ignoring the shenanigans on the daily basis and just hold/buy/watch through thick and thin unless something changes your vision. I have rebalanced with this insight in mind. I realize if I am under constant stress with what’s going on with my portfolio, then something with it needs to be addressed.

The game is still not in the PlayStation store more than half a year after release. And from looking closer at the game it seems 2 things are obvious to me:     
1) they have unmaintainable bug-riddled codebase that they will struggle to build anything upon     
2) they have spent so many years on Cyberpunk, but the game is mostly a re-skin of the Witcher 3 game

Yes, they hit it big with the sales on the release, but this was done at a huge cost to their reputation and goodwill with their clients, which translates to lower future engagement and revenue. If they had any plans to get filthy rich with the Cyberpunk Online release (copying Rockstar's GTA V Online success) they really shoot themselves in the foot with this botched release."

2021-05-28 07:54:43,stocks,"They don’t and it’s not, Reddit has just convinced itself that anytime a stock goes up it’s a ‘short squeeze’ lol.

It’s went up because of frenzied retail investors desperate FOMO on robinhood. Sort of a self fulfilling prophecy."
2021-05-28 06:58:59,stocks,"Yes, they could wait it out but also need to pay to maintain their positions. Since there's no way of knowing how long the surge lasts before the dip, it's a gamble on whether to pay to maintain a losing position or just buy to cover."
2021-05-28 08:57:30,stocks,AMC has already issued stock twice during this fiasco. They're also still in debt. They're going to keep diluting shares if the price keeps getting pumped over value.  They've proven that twice already and they have a good reason to do it.  So if you do buy in expect more stock issues in the future.
2021-05-28 07:16:17,stocks,Same. Didn’t realise it paid
2021-05-28 10:40:40,stocks,I jus took a monster shit. Was really smelly. Sorry
2021-05-28 10:47:00,stocks,I'm not entirely sure what a meme stock is anymore. Apparently $F is a meme now?
2021-05-28 12:27:33,stocks,It's a bit of a meme. Market cap too big right now.
2021-05-28 10:38:49,stocks,"I think it is somewhat caught up in it.

No I don't think BYND is a meme. However for some reason there's some correlation there, same thing happened earlier this year when it hit $190 while the memes were pumping."
2021-05-28 10:41:43,stocks,It’s 100% related
2021-05-28 15:25:13,stocks,"Uh, yesterday was essentially flat with it up? It jumped a lot on March 25th during a remarkable comeback in the major averages?

I am fully aware of what happened in late January, but the stock related to games being up doesn't always equal=major averages down.

It was also up a fair amount on Wednesday as well and the index that y'all care about the most outperformed on the back of growth tech."
2021-05-28 10:04:47,stocks,"If you're refering to CPI numbers, they were carried by used car sales. If you looked into them, there wasn't really anything out of the ordinary. Anything affected by the chip/lumber shortage was up, most other stuff was down."
2021-05-28 09:58:51,stocks,Transitory
2021-05-28 10:00:20,stocks,Inflation is cancelled. Until it is time to take profits by the big money they will bring it up again. Then when stocks are low they will buy back in and ride it to the top. This is like the 3rd time this cycle has happened.
2021-05-28 10:04:27,stocks,"A) its silly to compare costs right now with the same time last year as prices went down in 2020 due to distortions caused by the pandemic 

B) this uptick in inflation is temporary and is due to continuing distortions caused by the pandemic and quick recovery"
2021-05-28 11:29:27,stocks,"The reverse repo market has never in history been this awash in cash.  Weds night, the banks parked over $450B at the Fed and other banks just to balance their books for the evening.  Inflation is just putting on it's sneakers."
2021-05-28 06:20:37,stocks,"The problem with the squeeze theory is that AMC short interest is waaaay below what GME's short interest was back in Jan. I think this is just people fomo'ing into a meme stock, pushing it up with pure hype. With the additional media attention, bringing it more cash, it could go up - but little of the rise has to do with short squeeze. We might see a few options related gamma squeezes though, as calls become ITM."
2021-05-28 10:32:50,stocks,AAPL’s p/e may be swole in historic terms but compared to the rest of the market it’s honestly dirt cheap. Lower P/E than the likes of WMT and KO
2021-05-28 12:36:18,stocks,"PE will drop a bit after buybacks.
Also apple is trying expanding in other areas not just smartphones and doing good. 
Also it's blue chip so it's less volatile. You can always exit when you see the trend change.

Gaming stocks and banks are like 10-15 PE. I use those to hedge tech (but buying only near support)"
2021-05-28 10:32:31,stocks," Is Apple: A) going to just absorb the higher corporate taxes proposed by the current U.S. administration which will directly effect their profitability or B) are they going to respond to the higher tax rates by raising the prices on their goods and services, passing them on to the consumer?

The answer of course is B. So, in reality, higher corporate taxes is just a tax on every consumer in the form of inflation."
2021-05-28 16:09:50,stocks,"That's correct. There used to be a way to claim a miscellaneous itemized deduction from realized IRA losses (with various specific conditions, including requiring you to cash out your IRA), but it was ended in 2018 by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), which is in force through 2025."
2021-05-28 12:36:32,stocks,Nope. Just not open Monday.
2021-05-28 09:18:07,stocks,I bought 2 cause I had some random cash in my account and wanted to at least have a little investment in the fun. Hoping I come out of it with some coffee money lol
2021-05-28 06:59:15,stocks,At what price:)
2021-05-28 09:04:24,stocks,"There was always a chance it could happen imo, the issue is i believe its going to crash hard at some point and a lot of these WSB guys will hold the bags. I can't tell you when, but at some point the big players will be satisfied with their profits and will sell."
2021-05-28 08:59:28,stocks,"Of course not.

But the cult will just keep moving the goal posts."
2021-05-28 09:11:34,stocks,"GME is still shorted to the high moon (I think), AMC is being shorted too but no where near as much as GME. The retail investors are propping them up to an extent, and the circlejerk around it is insufferable."
2021-05-28 08:55:06,stocks,"I mean not GME or AMC tbh, those are dumb imo. But PLTR has some good potential."
2021-05-28 11:55:21,stocks,"The sale is what is taxed, not the cash out."

2021-05-28 08:18:03,stocks,Don’t FOMO
2021-05-28 08:32:02,stocks,too late for AMC.  trying to get in at this point is high bagholder risk.
2021-05-28 08:31:00,stocks,"Just get some coins, at least there is fundamental story behind their rise due to government planning to gamble away trillions of dollars in 2022 again."
2021-05-28 08:23:39,stocks,I thought it joined the meme stock crowd along with black berry and gme? the fans are nice but im not fomoing
2021-05-28 09:03:09,stocks,"ok, you stay away."
2021-05-28 09:09:09,stocks,is this an accurate list of what you mean? https://www.investopedia.com/investing/consumer-defensive-stocks/
2021-05-28 08:55:35,stocks,SBUX for me
2021-05-28 09:04:31,stocks,The best info you can get is on Real Vision. You will need sub but you honestly cannot find better info on carbon trade as retail.

2021-05-28 11:21:31,stocks,"I wouldn’t with BB. I bought and held for the last 3-4 months, and there’s no news that I’ve seen or been expecting to increase the price in the short-term. I’m hoping it’ll get back to my 12.64 average price, but I’m not confident."
2021-05-28 15:18:08,stocks,"I’m curious, too.  But when I did some searching I couldn’t find a reason beyond things starting to open back up and people going on vacation?"
2021-05-28 11:26:55,stocks,"SPCE is a meme stock in that other subreddit so it is very volatile right now and based mostly on speculation. I'd get out now to take profits and reposition later when it inevitably dips again, if applicable."
2021-05-28 15:41:42,stocks,"Do the math on how many flights they need to make to become profitable and look at the execution history of the company.

It’s garbage."
2021-05-28 10:18:15,stocks,If apple goes anywhere near 90 I’m buying as much as I can afford

2021-05-28 11:43:27,stocks,Yeah….no…dude is a moron
2021-05-28 06:56:31,stocks,Which do you expect to have a better share price in one or two months? I know which one I think is the safer bet
2021-05-28 06:50:35,stocks,"Please do so, lol."
2021-05-28 07:31:41,stocks,Do you really compare company with biggest market cap to meme stocks ?
2021-05-28 12:05:51,stocks,"Oh, 100%. With things like this it’s important to understand that its effectively gambling, and the house always wins in the end."
2021-05-28 11:49:05,stocks,"It is, but I think a lot of people are going to get really hurt in the end.  It’s also isn’t a good look for the future.  Let’s not kid ourselves, big players in the market are already figuring out how to, or are actively working to,  manipulate these forums/social media groups to make bucks off of regular people.  The stories I see in some of the more echo chamber subs are disheartening to read.  People who are putting in everything they have because this is their ticket out.  I hope those are just made up."
2021-05-28 13:01:50,stocks,"Sadly most folks aren’t psychic. If timing the best entries and exits was so easy we’d all be rich. 

That’s why it’s advised to keep your distance from something if it’s already run up a ton in short time and if you are in on a play, take profit gradually on the way up. 

The peak doesn’t last long and things go down in a heartbeat. FOMO effs most folks up cause it makes them recklessly leap into something without a gameplan."

2021-05-28 09:48:32,stocks,"I wouldn't get into this stock unless it's under $8. If I had this stock right now, I would sell and walk happily away with profits and not look back."

2021-05-28 11:18:34,stocks,"The average of the 9 analysts prices is around $44. I’d say around there would be fair, could also see the 50s if they keep doing well. Company is like 25 years old such a solid pick."
2021-05-28 10:20:34,stocks,And out green! Bags empty!
2021-05-28 10:22:00,stocks,Finally getting off this ride.
2021-05-28 07:40:22,stocks,"This began before the pandemic even, the last Administration wanted a weaker dollar (allegedly to boost our exports)."
2021-05-28 08:05:18,stocks,Probably living in the UK and buying US stocks? Same issue here as a European.
2021-05-28 08:11:10,stocks,"I don't, I'm in the UK so buying US stocks which are in Dollars, then to sell/hold them they have to be converted back to £ so you lose the currency difference"
2021-05-28 12:06:00,stocks,"The sooner one realizes there’s a big difference between unrealized gains and actual profit, the easier it is to fight FOMO. 

Can’t panic sell at the worst time or hold the bag if you never bother."
2021-05-28 12:28:46,stocks,"That was an adrenaline rushing fun time lol, my endorphins were off charts high, I came in playing it like a casino, esp since I didn't go to the actual casinos this year lol, so was pretty much prepared to take it skyrocket to the moon or crashing into land, but think idea is was really just in it for the ride!"
2021-05-28 12:04:32,stocks,I swear I'm just starting to feel normal again lol. I went through about 10 years worth of dopamine during that shit.
2021-05-28 11:39:44,stocks,"Is BB a meme stock? I guess that's why it suddenly popped :S

I had a pending sell order for half at $12 that just went through. Maybe I should close the rest before the pump turns to dump..."
2021-05-28 08:44:28,stocks,But the shortages happening these days are due to everything being shut down in 2020. I remember farmers destroying their crops and pouring milk out for months because no one was buying it.
2021-05-28 06:22:29,stocks,Not at opening I think. But near the end of the day? Definitely; people won't want to hold inflated meme stocks over a 3 day weekend.
2021-05-28 06:05:26,stocks,I’m betting it climbs to 35 today and stays. This shit is so nuts. Bag holders are going to be sore soon
2021-05-28 05:57:22,stocks,Up 12% in premarket so far. Just don’t see it plummeting yet. But we’ll see
2021-05-28 05:55:25,stocks,But it’s up 2% on the pre market alone?
2021-05-28 06:05:10,stocks,There is no reason for It to drop like a stone when fomoers who wish they got in cheaper will buy the dip at 26 or lower
2021-05-28 09:23:45,stocks,It started to spike just before closing. The mooning may continue today. But I'm betting next week will be huge for the first weed stock on the NASDAQ.
2021-05-28 14:30:46,stocks,interesting - thank you
2021-05-28 14:44:15,stocks,July 19
2021-05-28 10:30:32,stocks,"Not sure why you sold, solid company it just goes sideways for periods. 

General trend is up though."
2021-05-28 10:00:06,stocks,"SFYL? Profit is profit, but the only reason I hadn't been YOLOing into it below $75 is I had a lot coming into this year and found it's not fun to have ~50% of your account in one equity."
2021-05-28 12:41:09,stocks,They announced buyback few days ago. Why did you sell? It's like a guarantee the price will go up
2021-05-28 13:21:44,stocks,"I do think you're right, but at the same time this movement is self reinforcing. When does the hype bubble pop?"
2021-05-28 12:06:59,stocks,this
2021-05-28 12:59:22,stocks,Not even with the Purosangue coming?
2021-05-28 15:57:28,stocks,Pretty sure DKNG is not making profit.
2021-05-28 10:35:06,stocks,Cheap enough
2021-05-28 10:34:51,stocks,"I said it last night and I said it this morning, my exit point was +50% profit

Anyone who thinks redditors moved 100k at market open are the real apes. This is pump and dump"
2021-05-28 14:30:36,stocks,Clearly you have not had Granny Smith. 🍏
2021-05-28 13:27:07,stocks,"It's been frustrating for sure but the gains will come. With a market cap of 2T, you'll probably never get 2x your money in under a year. But in rougher times, it'll surely hold up better.

 And the company itself keeps innovating and printing money so I have faith the stock will eventually follow. I'm just holding and adding bits and pieces when I can because whenever a breakout does come, i'll be glad I did.

I look at Apple as a hybrid between a growth stock and a boomer stock in my portfolio. Have more aggressive growth plays that have much higher upside but it's nice to have a blue chip like Apple that still gives you the growth of a tech company as opposed to something like KO or JNJ (which are good stocks in their own right but as someone in my 20s I'll stick to FAAMG)."
2021-05-28 15:51:31,stocks,"No, do your own research. I like the company and use their products and their fundamentals, ""reddit hype"" aside. You can read professionals opinions on the topic if you'd like. Dismissing a stock because people on reddit talk about it is not a metric I take seriously."
2021-05-28 15:57:52,stocks,I wouldn't at 33 at the moment. I bought originally at 25 and usually add on dips below 31.
2021-05-28 14:09:23,stocks,"Got in at $9 sold at $14, if only I'd of waited an extra week or two. Oh well, live and let learn."
2021-05-28 15:30:38,stocks,It’s my second largest holding but it is expensive as fuck though.
2021-05-28 15:06:05,stocks,"I’ve been watching it since it pulled back to $300 and didn’t pull the trigger. Been regretting it ever since... even if it falls lower I won’t be mad cuz I want to buy more and think it could drop lower. I just really wanted to buy this stock, love Costco."
2021-05-28 08:33:40,stocks,"I made a bunch of money on GME on the first run up. Then I fomo'd back into it and sold it a bunch of times since then. 

I learned my lesson though it cost me a solid chunk of my profits"
2021-05-28 09:11:48,stocks,I sold my 12.50 AMC call 3 weeks ago for 120 and thought I scored big. I feel violated now...
2021-05-28 08:13:57,stocks,"I mean yeah if you got in early enough you're fine to hold even if they drop a bit. 

Seems silly to be buying more right now tho. And the thing with making lots of money from gambling is that you can lose it just as quickly"
2021-05-28 12:10:02,stocks,More CPI numbers are out June 10. I'm expecting a dip that'll give a good buying opportunity
2021-05-28 10:21:37,stocks,"No there isn't, this is such a load of rubbish. The answer to every spike is not ""short squeeze"""
2021-05-28 11:00:02,stocks,For month people here say that anything below 60 is a cannot miss opportunity. Who would have guessed it could drop 1/3 of that in mere days? I could not buy more at that price because I was just frozen in shock lol.
2021-05-28 15:43:21,stocks,"> I mean, if you believe in it, it can’t hurt to average down. 

It totally can hurt if your beliefs end up wrong..."

2021-05-28 12:41:33,stocks,Where did you find out about them?
2021-05-28 12:24:47,stocks,Thank you sir. Was able to find an article that confirmed it. I thought I woke up in a parallel universe.
2021-05-28 19:22:04,stocks,In his defense I've been around for six or seven years and I still don't really understand how it works
2021-05-28 11:45:10,stocks,I have 500 @ $136 and I laugh at the idea of selling. She has said over and over they look five years out.
2021-05-28 11:18:33,stocks,I think there will be a pullback and I can get back in. I wouldn't mind holding a smaller position long term. I invested way too much money when it dipped below $20 because I was fairly certain it could hit $25ish again fairly quickly. I just didn't want to get greedy and ride it back down this time.
2021-05-28 11:47:20,stocks,Yeah I'd definitely buy some more if it dips to $20 which is seems to constantly do
2021-05-28 19:46:02,stocks,"I know. It was a foolish purchase. There is currently a class action lawsuit against the company for lying and violating securities rules. However, to join the lawsuit you have to actually have *sold* for a loss. I'm not sure if I should just keep holding or if I should cash out and join the suit. 🥺"
2021-05-28 19:52:02,stocks,"No but I got in at 381...🥴🥴 

There is a class action lawsuit against coinbase right now concerning them lying to investors and potentially violating securities laws. To join the lawsuit I would have to actually *sell* for a loss. What do you think? I'm tempted to sell, but I don't want to cement these losses in."
2021-05-28 06:04:28,stocks,Dude you fucking nailed it

2021-05-28 09:05:34,stocks,what's the play?
2021-05-28 07:23:12,stocks,Maybe this time it will rally with those meme stonks who knows
2021-05-28 09:20:04,stocks,"At some point they will be though, and they’ll have to be. Trucks see a lot of use at ko sites, some of which may be a significant distance away from home, or for fleet use they may have to go all over the state in a day. Or in apartment complexes they may very will have a limited amount of charging spaces. I simply can’t believe that charging stations awill not become more ubiquitous over the next couple of years as pure electrics become significantly more popular. 

And someone will have to build them. Tesla’s supercharging network is very popular, it’s just still limited. Charging stations at places like office buildings and government buildings and fleet lots will still need to be built. Retrofitting homes with the requisite equipment will still need to happen. Who is making that product?"

2021-05-28 08:37:49,stocks,"I have no position in AMC but 700 million in volume yesterday is definitely not just retail investors. For comparison, Apple did 95 million in volume. Still not touching with a ten foot pole."
2021-05-28 08:37:01,stocks,"Exactly! There aren't enough shorts to explain the melt up in prices, but if you get millions of people to dump money into it, then you have momentum algos pumping it, and prob a few whales buying too, that explains the price run up. 

But its literally a pump and dump. It will fall as quickly as it rose (prob faster) and many people will be left holding the bags until the rumor starts going around that this wasn't the *real* squeeze and then it'll start all over again"
2021-05-28 10:22:20,stocks,">It’s went up because of frenzied retail investors desperate FOMO on robinhood. Sort of a self fulfilling prophecy.

Momentum factor!"
2021-05-28 08:09:30,stocks,I feel that way too. I was in the GME first squeeze feel like that was a real one. Not sure about these later ones but I have not been following it closely.
2021-05-28 08:07:16,stocks,I see. That's why it's important to hold but it's almost impossible.
2021-05-28 12:28:28,stocks,Compare market cap to similar companies. If it's much much bigger then it's probably a hype stock (unless it has solid financials)
2021-05-28 12:29:33,stocks,right but you could say that about lot of companies stock. doesn't make it a meme as such just makes it overhyped.
2021-05-28 06:23:22,stocks,"All things aside, AMC isn't really a meme stock, they've got great fundamentals. Obviously not fundamentals to support where the price might go, but AMC is not a bad company. I just wish I got some when the valuation was attractive around 5-6 bucks."

2021-05-28 09:19:13,stocks,I think any sane person would have sold AMC after yesterday's large jump. It was up 55% at one point for the day
2021-05-28 09:48:18,stocks,"What I don’t understand is why anyone would short these stocks at this point. It seems so risky. Like, there are no other stocks anywhere that are worth shorting? Other than this meme stocks? I don’t get it"

Dude knows how to find value and make money (without regard for scruples, of course).

The only reason he chose BTI and Imperial, imo, is because of the amazing valuations right now.

PM and MO also seem to have somewhat of a cult following as the #1 brands. It's like Coke vs. Pepsi in that regard. Pepsi might be a better business, but because of the brand name people are willing to pay a premium for Coke stock.  The same seems to be going on with MO and PM, imo.

It makes sense to some degree but you've got to look at the fundamentals.  I own PM because of their international exposure, and also because they're killing it with IQOS. But MO is not in the same position at all... it truly is a disappearing market for them as a US-only company.

Have bigger positions in BTI and IMBBY strictly based on the valuations, however."

Chargers in a home can be easily installed by more or less any electrician.

Yes apartment complexes will need chargers and in general charging stations will become more widespread as the switch happens, but people are already buying stock in charging companies like Plug and Chargepoint as if they will generate revenue like gas stations when that's simply not the case. Specifically in terms of land use, almost no additional land will be dedicated to charging stations since they can easily be added to any existing parking area (you're not gonna build a charging station next to an existing rest station because you can just add chargers to the rest station)"

Don't they have like 7 metric tonnes of debt which is gonna be really painful once interest rates start to go up?

Then it became a war of attrition and so many jumped in that it propped the price up which in turn makes it more appealing to short. I'm sure most of those early short positions have covered at this point and now the new shorts are jumping in. This whole thing will be a chapter in a text book someday.

Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't get into AMC long term, because I believe that the big times of cinemas are numbered and that the sector of physical cinemas is gonna shrink eventually. For now, however, I see a much improved cash position, I see pent-up demand for cinema-experiences, I see places opening up and capacity rising and I see a lot of Blockbuster movies who have been pushed back getting released. 

My personal price target for AMC within the next 2-3 years was (and still is) between 15 and 20.

There's also a low, very low possibility of a buyout, although I wouldn't bank on it."

2021-05-28 10:14:58,stocks,"What? Where did you get that it was because of human limitation? It was because that's how much I happened to drive to get around from site to site in an 8 hour work day, I wasn't driving for a living I was driving to get around to various work sites. The work day is still going to stay 8 hours and the more time you spend driving the less time you spend working. I could have easily spent 6 hours driving every day but then I'd only spend 2 hours working, who wants to pay an 8-hour work day for 2-hours of work?

For long-haul truck drivers yes they will likely outrange current EV tech, but they will also probably be the last to adopt EV tech and wait until it's efficient for long haul trucking before they do."

I'm really interested in the clean energy space. These are the two ETFs I'm looking at:

* $PBW: Invesco WilderHill Clean Energy ETF
* $INRG: iShares Global Clean Energy UCITS ETF

The top 10 of both their holdings are completely different, but they are both aimed at the same sector. Is there any logic to invest equal money in both of them or is it better to just put all of that fund into one of them?

I guess ultimately if I knew which one would give better yield I would just pick that but as that's not possible is it safer to go for more coverage? 

Any guidance would be really appreciated. Thanks."
2021-05-28 05:29:08,stocks,Their top 10 are different so it makes sense to hold these 2 different ETFs

So I’ve been learning how to read financials and have been reading as much as I can and a common pattern I see with some companies, for example, Roblox is that revenue will increase every year but net income will be more in the negative. Like is this not a red flag? Am I suppose to just ignore this and focus on increasing revenue. I’m so confused because a lot of stocks you hear talking heads on tv or people on social media hype are like this and it’s frustrating like am I suppose to find profitable companies or not. Just need some perspective when it comes to reading a companies financials and seeing numbers like this."
2021-05-28 01:59:29,stocks,"Net income = Revenue - Expenses. If expenses grow faster than sales, net income drops.

As far as the rest...well...generally if you're looking at a growth stock a la Roblox, increasing revenue/sales is more important than increasing earnings, because the *idea* is that a growing company spends more than it earns in order to invest in growing future sales/capturing market share/etc. etc.

That being said...the market is in a bubble, and there's lots of folks running around saying fundamentals don't matter while they're keeping one eye on the exit hoping they don't get caught without a chair when the music stops."

Is there a measurement or name for this?"
2021-05-28 02:32:03,stocks,"You’re not supposed to ignore this - rather, you have to ask yourself whether the company or industry is in growth mode or mature. If it’s in growth mode, investors expect the company to reinvest its earnings back into the company in order to fuel growth, so revenue and gross margin rates are king. A quick way to value a company is to look at its multiples compared to its peers, and in the case of growth company, you need to look at revenue/price multiples for last twelve months, next twelve months, and even these days next 24 months"

Investing is also far more available than it was 10 years ago, and this has caused an influx of money into the market in the past 10 years. A lot of companies are still left to recover from covid, and P/E numbers are pricing that in, possibly with some asset inflation thanks to the accessibility of investing now. To call this a bubble is crazy. Sure, there are a couple companies that don't deserve their current valuation by any stretch of the imagination, but that isn't to say the market as a whole is a bubble."

My understanding is that I owe 6% on principle but even if I fix the issue before the end of the tax year, I will still get hit with the 10% early withdrawal fee.

Is there a way to withdraw the money from the IRA before the end of the year and not get hit with the 6% or 10% fee?

I believe the money was contributed to the roth IRA in March 2021 and I purchased $6000 of VTI which was blended with my previous IRA contribution. Which means the contribution has appreciated so I don't even know how much to withdraw, especially since I have dividends reinvesting.

2021-05-28 05:42:53,stocks,"First look into if you're eligible to contribute to a traditional IRA and call your broker about doing a backdoor roth or rollover. Backdoor roth is for people like you who make too much money (congrats btw) If not, see below.

I just went through this. Log on to your account and search for ""withdraw excess contribution."" With TDA, there is a form to print out, sign, then upload to message center. With Fidelity it's an online form. On the form there will be an option to tick to let the broker calculate the gains for you. Also there will be an option for the broker to sell shares of your choosing in case you don't have cash in the account. I think you can avoid the 6% if you get it out before filing taxes for the contribution year. You can't escape the 10% though."
2021-05-27 23:52:27,stocks,"I believe you get 1 withdrawal without penalties, but I’m hoping to be confirmed or corrected."
2021-05-28 09:14:36,stocks,What if I currently make less money than the limit and I contributed to Roth but starting July I will make more money such that the total for the year will be over the limit?
2021-05-28 10:02:50,stocks,You can simply withdraw the money.  No worries.
2021-05-28 00:05:06,stocks,Can you explain what your mistake was?
2021-05-28 05:20:38,stocks,This is the correct answer. I did the same thing in your exact situation.
2021-05-28 10:19:24,stocks,the backdoor is called a conversion (IRA conversion to Roth IRA)

I contributed to my 2021 IRA in March but will be over the income limits for 2021. So I'm not allowed to contribute to an IRA due to my income. How do I fix this mistake without paying fees?"

2021-05-28 00:17:08,stocks,I think he means he makes more money than the limit so he’s not allowed to contribute to his roth ira at all.
2021-05-28 00:16:25,stocks,"No. I only put $6k in. 

The problem is that my income is too high. Roth IRA's are only available if your income is below a certain threshold (which I exceeded)"

I would like to avoid both fees"

2021-05-28 00:16:22,stocks,"Correct.

The idea is that your new purchase will be settled with the proceeds of your prior sale, which will settle sooner or at the same time.

But if you sell before that happens, you're free-riding on the settlement system."
2021-05-28 00:33:56,stocks,"Correct, I do it all the time in my dividend portfolio. Just hold on to the new shares until everything settles. Vanguard even gives me a reminder when I buy with unsettled funds. Doesn't matter much to me because I'm not selling that often."

2021-05-28 07:47:52,stocks,"I got a rookie question. It seems like my trades take at least 2 days to settle (new cash transfer takes even longer, usually 3-5 days).

2021-05-28 00:48:33,stocks,Awesome! Thanks for the info
2021-05-28 08:59:10,stocks,"There are special rules just for them. They have to maintain a $25K ""excess margin balance,"" meaning every night when margin is rectified they have to have at least $25k cash or they get a margin call in the morning. It's impossible to have both cash and debt, so that excess means any overnight holdings are fully paid for. 

They can trade their excess margin balance from the night before with a 25% margin requirement, meaning they can buy stock worth 4X the cash they have. They can buy and sell that as many times as they want during the day.

They also have the option to use a special tax reporting method where they report their account value at the beginning and end of the year and add or deduct the difference as ordinary income. No wash sale rule, no $3k deduction limit, no detailed listings of basis and proceeds (unless they're audited and have to prove they really are a day trader as their job and not an ordinary investor; there's no clear IRS rule defining that, so having proof of entering and exiting significant positions nearly every trading day of the year is about all that works).

The margin rules keep (most) n00bs from getting in so deep they can never get out. For experienced traders and innately stable instruments (treasuries, mortgage securities, etc), they're relaxed quite a bit. For penny stocks and volatile companies, they're made super-tight."
2021-05-28 08:31:48,stocks,"They trade in a margin account, borrowing the money between settlements, or only partial amounts in a cash account."
2021-05-28 11:09:31,stocks,"Thanks for the detailed info. Thought that there might've been a catch with those day traders, didn't really know about margin account or how it works. $25K is not a small amount of money for regular retail investors, would work well as a gatekeeping measure I think."
2021-05-28 09:01:09,stocks,"Thank you. Also about setting the stop loss- if I purchase a stock using unsettled balance and set a stop loss, and say that stop loss triggers on the same day or prior to settlement date and the stock is sold, would I incur good faith violation? If so I guess I shouldn't set a stop loss if I buy with unsettled cash."
2021-05-28 12:36:21,stocks,"That's exactly what it is, like the $2k minimum for a margin account."
2021-05-28 09:10:49,stocks,"Correct.  Wait until you've cleared to set anything automatic, but many people also avoid those protections while not touching their allowed day trades; just keep some in reserve."
2021-05-28 00:00:00,stocks,"ETF advice (canadian) Hi All, 

I was wondering if I can get some advice on some Canadian ETFs.  I am not retiring anytime soon.  I was looking at VFV, VSP.

I believe that the Canadian dollar will continue to rise.  What ETFs would you recommend that would shield your investment from the rising Canadian dollar."
2021-05-27 23:15:47,stocks,(Canadian Hedged) would do better if the Canadian dollar continues to rise correct?
2021-05-28 03:00:19,stocks,"ZSP or XUU all the way lol. VFV is good as well.
So many newer people are getting into investing which is great. I am bias and don't hedge. Or drip.

But do your research on how hedging actually works.
Dividends and dividend ETF'S. Covered call products. Drips and synthetic drips. All seem to be the rage.

Yes you can hedge right now. And then swap etc. So far longterm hedging has proved to not be the winner. Typically has higher fees as well. That's part of the draw back.
Choose your thesis wisely and stick to it. Or try to time it like everything else.

Hedged ETF'S are 2 bets as compared to 1. You are betting on the market and currency. Versus just the market."
2021-05-28 16:15:14,stocks,Correct
2021-05-28 09:05:54,stocks,"Isn't it the opposite? Hedging the currency takes the FX bet out of the equation. Hence the hedged ETF's are only betting that the stock index will appreciate, with no bet on the direction of the FX component."
2021-05-28 10:45:41,stocks,"I'm with prestigious on this one. I prefer unhedged where possible. I'm a bear on Canadian currency. It's tied to higher commodity prices right now. When the dollar drops, I'll get the benefit of stock appreciation and currency.

And example of hedge that I own is BMO's QQQ = ZQQQ, because it's cheaper than buying QQQ.

To me, I think the Canadian dollar is usually around $0.70 to the greenback. Take advantage of buying US stocks when our dollar is good."
2021-05-28 11:34:38,stocks,"Depending on currency and which foreign market yes. However I mean in betting that the CDN will strengthen vs USD in Hedged US market ETF'S. It's having to be correct on which way the dollar is heading and possibly timing it if you wanted to change when it isn't.
We are at a tough call point right now....

I'm seeing this as very good, of course, but I feel like this whole GameStop situation was a one-time thing, so who knows. With that, what should I wait and look for? Is it possible to see those stocks skyrock? Is the general consensus is that it's going to fail?

Apparently there is a vote on June 2 and the CEO said they will count and make public exactly what is the float before the vote is conducted.
The expectation is the short percentage is a lot higher than reported as it is hard to correctly count shorts.
Hence people started buying which meant shorts have to cover which means they have to buy more and the cycle continues
Until it doesn't. All short squeezes as the name suggests are a squeeze and prices fall as fast as they rise if not faster.

2021-05-27 21:49:59,stocks,You’re witnessing a dual front war of hedge funds vs retail. But retail knows exactly what’s going on and won’t sell causing the price to increase. You can buy AMC or GME.

2021-05-27 23:42:04,stocks,"What is happening? The same reason as GME. The big money is making money off the stock going down. Wsb want price to pump so the big money gives up their short positions. Which theoretically will keep pushing the price up further.

Why AMC and not GME peaking? Rng from the gods.
Jokes aside, Probably cause AMC had a market cap of a third~~half of GME. So it is easier to pump. 

I would sell right now. Or if the MACD 1hr indicator gives a sell signal to confirm the hype has peaked."

I’ve also heard a lot of them say that if they want to continue speculating on the stock, they will take out their initial investment and leave the profits in. That way, whatever happens, they are risking 0% of their capital. 

The other thing I hear a lot is, “Manage your risk, and the profits will take care of themselves” or “Live to trade another day.”"

What I don't understand with all the AMC & GME DD's is the logic behind hedge funds deep underwater not slowly easing out of their positions in the 4 months since the January squeeze, rather than sitting there like idiots knowing that they'll inevitably have to pay multiple times more than the current price. Trade volume for AMC *just today* was 150% of float so even if the stock is shorted well above 100% it's not like the shares for shorts to cover haven't been there."

Hedge funds came about after the IC act of 1940 because they’re largely unregulated, bypassing a lot of the restrictions that mutual funds and other investment funds must obey from the IC act of 1940. The stock market crash of 1929 was largely throttled by over leveraging equity positions with borrowed money"
2021-05-28 09:06:42,stocks,"  
Thanks for the explanation and to all here who help others with insights not found anywhere else from what I've researched.  After having my stock act not doing much for over 15 yrs when in the hands of a friend who became a stock broker for E. Jones, I decided to take control of my own act and transferred it to TDA.  I never knew about synthetic shares.  Why hasn't the SEC done anything about these hedge funds using naked shorts prior to the GME event?  There are so many people who give their earnings to brokers with the trust in them and the SEC that their investment isn't subject to this kind of BS mainly because the avg investor doesn't know how much the stocks are manipulated by hedge funds.  The avg investor knows about speculation and risk but I don't think they know about synthetic shares.  Again, thanks to you all for the education I am getting here."

Because most of the redditors that cite this as the reason (with absolute certainty, I might add) generally don't know their own ass from a hole in the ground when it comes to market making operations, much less how millions of independent actors are effecting price discovery in the marketplace.

Just look at Archegos. No one know that VIAC was being pumped by a 10:1 leveraged family fund. As soon as they were margin called, VIAC collapsed 50% of its value in 2 days. If people had known that a 10% move in VIAC would have caused a bankrupting margin call on Archegos, I don't think there would have been as many people investing in VIAC. And odds are, VIAC wouldn't have done a share offering at 10% below its price  which triggered the whole event.

The opacity in the market is what makes trading an inherently risky ordeal. Investing tries to hedge the risk by extrapolate over time, but even that can be a crap shoot unless you're just looking at indexes."

Why would a multibillion dollar hedge fund risk all of its capital to short 1 stock? That seems like horrible risk management.

2021-05-28 07:28:32,stocks,"Because you can't predict risk while shorting, if you have a 1000 dollar in capital and sold 5 gme at the price of 4 dollar each you would gain 20 dollar when the company goes bankrupt. That's what they want in the end, for the company to go bankrupt so they can pocket all that money. But when that same stock goes to 400 dollars in a matte of months you suddenly owe 1600 dollars. Even if the shares drop back to 200 each you will need to liquidate a lot of your portofolio to cover. The thing is they have done this hundred of times with other companies and only this one time they got caught.  When the stock price reached 20 they thought no way it goes higher, just like so many other people at the time, so what do they do? They short it again. Then it goes to 100, no way it goes higher right? Short it again. And just keep shorting. Go to r/superstonk and read the DD House of Cards I, II and III and you might be a bit more convinced. I'm not saying this is for certain what is happening. In my eyes it's still a theory, but you'd be a fool not to buy just one share of gme and to see what happens."

2021-05-28 05:38:32,stocks,"> Berkshire is trading over $400k

Berkshire is trading at that price because it has never split stock, google what a market cap is before you make an embarassment of yourself. One share going to 400k is way different than billions of shares all going to 400k."
2021-05-27 22:17:19,stocks,"That assumed there is buying pressure on the way up, which there will not be once a certain price target is hit. People simply won't be able to afford the shares to drive the price high enough. Everyone saying 500k is the floor is a bag holder."

2021-05-27 22:14:24,stocks,Yes it will likely rise and fall extremely quickly. This has happened before. Look up Volkswagon in 2008. Right now it's expected to happen again but even more so because there are more shorts than there are stock.

2021-05-27 22:47:13,stocks,"Yeah, I now grasp the situation better and understand what could happen, and will be careful with that. I understand there are AMC holders responding to me because they're in this ''meme stock'' thing.

 I think it can only be profitable for me at this point since I bought low, but I will check often how the situation evolves and where it's a good moment to sell."
2021-05-28 08:25:21,stocks,"Ultimately it's because their models are wrong. These hfs don't decide real time wether to buy or sell something. They develop models that tell them what to do. So when gme or amc are x price they buy and when they are x price they sell. 

Their models are just wrong because most of them are in fact stupid."
2021-05-28 07:38:03,stocks,"Maybe you are right, we will see. It wouldn't be the first time that financial institutions dug their own graves by taking too much risk."

2021-05-27 22:52:11,stocks,TBF on that first run up it was going to 1000 plus. Several brokerage even stated as such themselves. When they turned off the buy side they saved their ass. No stock will ever have that same set up. An already spectacular run was literally moments from becoming absolutely legendary.
2021-05-28 15:07:57,stocks,Because stocks don't only just go up?

2021-05-28 07:23:28,stocks,GME didn't even crack $400 in the last squeeze.  This notion that we're somehow going to $100K per share or whatever is just nonsense.
2021-05-27 23:05:51,stocks,I will never forget that.
2021-05-28 00:42:42,stocks,"When they turned off the buy side they saved their ass. This part is not quite true. Most brokerages such as Vanguard did not have this issue. Also most were trading on Margin, if you had the cash ready in the account the buying power was there for you to use."
2021-05-28 15:34:24,stocks,"So because stocks don't only go up, anyone who ever made a profit in any stock at all is still a bagholder? Man, I wouldn't wanna be one of those dumb bagholders who bought apple 20 or 10 years ago."

2021-05-28 11:31:59,stocks,"10k isn’t peanuts for a single day. You’re nuts WSB tard.

He’s 100% right. They always tell you “not to sell” while selling. It is literally a law of this type of thing that you have to have bag holders. Unless there are literally 100% of all shares shorted, but there aren’t. It’s a large number but not 100%. So…it’s impossible for everyone to have their shares bought for crazy money. 

At the end of the day the cap will be 30-50 dollars and people will be selling off real soon. Watch."
2021-05-28 08:32:19,stocks,"They didn't account for whatever factors caused gme and amc to turn around in the first place and they didn't change strategies obviously since amc tripled again lol. 
They also didn't properly hedge. You can you be short gme or c and be down nothing. Lol it's in their fucking name and they failed to do it. 
Bear in mind most hedges have probably made a killing off this volatility it's just a few really dumb ones that got caught with their dicks in their hands."

2021-05-28 01:36:30,stocks,RH banning buying would be big enough to have a downside effect. Then other brokerages got in on the restrictions.
2021-05-28 08:02:26,stocks,Majority of retail traders buying GME were not on vanguard. You're being intentionally dense. Like I said. Don't take my word for it. The brokerages themselves said they had to do something to stop the rise.
2021-05-28 15:20:25,stocks,"It's not like there is just 1 hedge fund or that all hedge funds have the same returns, so it obviously varies.  But hedge funds exist to outperform traditional investment strategies (of course, they don't always).

2021-05-28 05:42:02,stocks,"RH alone wasn't even shit, the clearing houses shut down trading. In my country people buy shares through actual honest to goodness banks, and the clearing house told the banks they can't buy. I don't think banks not having collateral or being on margin was ever really a problem, especially with 15+$ fees on each trade (or 0.01% whichever is higher)."
2021-05-28 09:08:18,stocks,People were trading on Margin that is why the buy button was not available.  This important information is not being explained enough. For the users that already had the cash in their brokerage accounts did not have this issue. A cash deposit into a brokerage account takes 7 business days. Many new apps allow investors to trade with instant cash that cash is being put out from the broker until yours clears in 7 business days. This information is in the terms and agreements of every broker company.
2021-05-28 00:00:00,stocks,"Advice - what to sell to help with home down payment? Closing on a home in June. Need to sell some stocks and trying to decide which ones.

We have Google and Amazon from 2013 which have been our biggest returns but I think we should hold considering those are two of the biggest companies right now.

We also have some stock we bought in February in anticipation of travel opening back up - United Airlines, Carnival, and Disney. 

UA and Carnival have had positive returns. Surprisingly (to me) Disney has not. 

We play the long game with these and originally planned on holding on to Disney for awhile and I am stubborn enough to not want to sell at a loss.

My wife also has some stocks in US real estate. We were originally going to hold on to this bc of the market (it's given us positive gains) but then thought about it and think it might've peaked.

We also have US emerging markets and European emerging markets. Neither of which I know much about...my wife invested in those but they have also had a positive gain.

We have had other losses too...those were long term stocks we decided to sell bc there wasn't any net return.

Any advice on which ones to sell? I am thinking Disney, as hard as it is to sell after less than six months, and US real estate.

TLDR: need some advice on what to sell to help with a home purchase. Leaning towards Disney and US real estate. Help! Don't want sellers remorse..."

2021-05-27 21:24:25,stocks,I would personally not listen to anonymous people on Reddit for something this important. You could be following financial advice from a 16 year old for all you know.
2021-05-27 22:51:25,stocks,"I am planning to get out of airlines and travel in the next month, so those to me would be first to go. And maybe the real estate ones."

2021-05-28 00:52:39,stocks,"I personally would sell carnival and earlines , but you gone loose some profits as this stocks gone go up but in long run its risky companys . Than i would sell part of amazon and google ."
2021-05-28 06:00:20,stocks,"It really depends on a myriad of things. But ill make the following assumptions:

1. You have a job that can confidently pay for your home.
2. You aren't trading stock with debt
3. Option calls or puts are not being utilized
4. You are interested in diversifying assets to combat risk
5. Context will only consider selling stocks to pay for the down payment.

Try to seperate your spec stocks from your reliable stocks. If you are losing pretty heavily on spec stocks, those should be the first to go. 

Your winner stocks, you should sell with your own discretion, but the question you should ask is ""Is the stock up because there is a rally or because it is a reliable stock?"" If you feel the stock is up because of a rally then sell, if not keep.

Now if you feel like you are holding onto a good stock, but it is losing, then you have a few choices. You can sell the stock that may potentialy appreciate in value or you can sell the stock that is already appreciated. I would recommend selling the winner stock, in an effort to mitigate risk (because you already won and you're cashing out). However, if you are risk tolerant then you can choose to sell your loser stocks instead (not only are you guaranteed to lose, there is a chance your winners will preform poorly. However, you are opperating under the idea that good stocks will always run up.)  Or you can sell considering a combination of the two.

I personally think it's a decent time to get into stock, however I am not omniscient. There may be an opportunity infront of you that is greater than what I see. So take my advice with a grain of salt. Good Luck!

Edit: I took a purely economics standpoint but someone made a good point about gains tax. Try to sell positions you have held for more than a year."
2021-05-28 14:45:43,stocks,"Definitely get some advice from your broker and do some reading. I'm just a rando, but here are my impressions. 

Personally, I'd sell off Carnival first out of all of these if you're green on it. United next. You're picking winners in a crowded and desperate market there and (I think) the reality of reopening won't live up to the anticipation that the stock market built in. Real estate depends on what sector you're in, is it residential building or commercial? If commercial I see less upside than residential construction but not a bad thing to hold onto.

I'd personally hold Disney, the management is excellent, the price is on what seems like a durable positive trend, and with reopening I expect a lot of good news coming for them (disclosure, I have stock in DIS).

Amazon and Google are solid, despite labor challenges I don't see Amazon slowing. Getting into prescriptions is going to make them a ton of money. Google is trundling along and I don't see any serious risks to their model."
2021-05-27 23:04:06,stocks,"Honestly, this is a tough one, its hard to know for sure without the exact companies your wife invested in, but if she thinks those are peaking or profits are plateauing, maybe sell those? Personally, I would continue holding Google, AMZN, and DIS (but I may be biased as I hold those). Your travel stocks could run up a little more, especially with summer coming and more people vaccinated --> more vacations --> more people going on cruises. 

Sellers remorse will always happen at some point in your investments.

And in regards to u/jokull1234, I am 30 not a random 16 year old on the internet"

Good luck."
2021-05-27 23:09:45,stocks,"It's a literal gamble no matter how you slice it. Do you absolutely need to liquidate some of your holdings to secure a down payment?

2021-05-28 00:18:14,stocks,What brokerage do you have? You can explore a Pledged Asset Line or SBLOC. Interest on those are relatively low right now <3%. Schwab and E*TRADE offer those in house. Other brokers might be in partnership with a bank. This would allow you tap into your stocks without selling drawing on a credit line. Then you pay back the loan in the most tax efficient way. Mixture of salary and stocks without the pressure of having to sell stocks at any particular time.

What NAV is used to determine the price I'd pay?  Whatever it is on 6/22?

I'm not sure what I want to do yet.  The income from GLQ is nice, and I bought half of what I have at a big discount last year.

2021-05-28 00:00:00,stocks,"Should we be concerned that all the garbage stocks are ripping ??? So I’m sure others have noticed the last few days that all the trash stocks have been absolutely on a tear.  Like Not just one but literally every single one.  The trashier the stock the more it’s ripping.  AMC, GME, RIDE, SOS, BB, etc. etc.  Even the scammy EV’s like NKLA was up like 15% today.  My theory on this is that short interest is pulling out of these garbage stocks for some reason (I refuse to believe anyone is actually buying NKLA).  I’ve heard before that something that often happens right before a crash is market short interest goes way down.  It’s one reason crashes are sometimes so bad, there are less shorts to cover a decline.  Anyone else got a theory on why this is happen or concerned about it ?"
2021-05-27 21:43:01,stocks,"Many garbage stocks currently are rising mainly because unfortunately many retail investors have no idea how the company is worth is calculated or how to value it rationally.

Shorts are pulling out now because most shorted them at the peak in Dec/Jan, and now is better to seal off those profits. It has been a few months of tech/spec dumps, value stocks are at their peak and soon the money will rotate back to some of the better tech names, they want to ensure to get out of it before the next positive wave. 

When shorts leave, it pops the stock a bit and then comes retail where they believe rally has started.

 Without worrying about valuations, they are planning to join one after other, declaring stock being worth from $300 to $5000, based on 🤷🏻‍♂️. This makes more and more retail to join.

It is greater fool theory, where everyone believe somebody will buy higher, until someday there isn't anyone above and we have big heavy bags."

At least 50% of its outstanding shares must be available for public trading.
It must report positive earnings in the most recent quarter.

There are also ""technical"" indicators that ignore all of that, and instead focus on prevailing market trends or psychology.

2021-05-27 21:50:38,stocks,"Basically, the actual price of the share means absolutely nothing. It could be 5 cents or $500. The $500 share could be cheap and the 5 cents one could be expensive. 

Ways that you can decide whether a stock is overpriced are: P/E ratio- this is one of the main stats that people look at; a lot of people consider around 20 as the sort of fair value point so above 20 could be considered on the high side. 
Also look at their market cap and the amount of free money the company is generating (called free cash flow). If the company's market cap (which is the amount of shares multiplied by the share price) is $20 billion then you would expect/hope that the company would actually generate that much cash over the next few years to warrant that valuation. 

CloudFlare has a market cap of $25 billion but they have negative cash flows currently. So it's safe so say that it's highly speculative. You wouldn't be able to value the company in a traditional way like this because they aren't generating free cash and they aren't making a profit. So you would have to instead do a lot of research into the company and decide how much you think they will grow and what their earnings may be 10 years from now.

Even if  you wanted to define it the way you did it there would be no good way to calculate it.  To calculate this stat as you defined it you would have to know the cost basis of every position in the market that was sold in a given day.  Cost basis is not available for any positions opened before 2011 because brokerages did not track it until then and as much as reddit is about short term trading there is a lot of money in the market for older generations that has been static for a lot  longer than that.  This stat is likely a made up number probably based on some sentiment surveys or other BS like new account creation or funding (which can also be skewed by people switching brokerages etc).  This is why I said it is likely a made up thing.  It is not a concrete number and it has no bearing on the health of the market.

2021-05-27 22:58:06,stocks,"I think you're misunderstanding how the market works. I don't think it's just a matter of semantics. The market is not like a piggy bank; money doesn't go into or out of it. When somebody buys a stock, they are buying it from somebody else.  For every buyer, there is a seller on the other side of the trade. So if I buy a share of stock for $100 dollars, somebody else just sold a share of the same stock for $100. The money doesn't end up in the market; it ends up in somebody else's account. You can talk about the total amount of money transacted in the market, though that could be just a matter of shares being traded back and forth with no price movement. You could also talk about the total amount of capital that companies raise by issuing shares of their stock and selling them, which is what the top-level comment of this thread is getting at, but that is not affected by transactions on the secondary market that don't involve the company itself. However, it doesn't really have any meaning to talk about money being put into the market, because the stock market fundamentally isn't something that stores money.

If this is the money that is used to buy stock then I don't know how this isn't covered by what I wrote above. Do you mean the market capitalization of some or all stocks? The value of a particular index? If so, it's important to note that that is a result of extrapolating the most recent price the relevant stocks traded for and is not representative of any kind of overall cash flows. The change in market cap of a company, or set of companies, is not money that is actually coming or going anywhere besides the amount that was transacted in the last trade, which might only be 100 shares.

I am noticing some strange $KHC option flow lately, largely what appears to be bearish. Flow seems to indicate large amounts of selling calls for July 16th, 2021 and Jan 21 2022 with strike prices ranging from 30-37.5 and 20-30, respectively. 

At the same time, there are buys (of calls)  for same time frames for the same expiry's above with strike prices ranging from 35-37.5 and 14-24, respectively.

Can anyone explain to me the likely strategy of this order flow? It seems bearish, based on volume and premiums paid out for the selling of calls, versus the buying of calls. I am unsure if I am missing something?

2021-05-28 00:00:00,stocks,"Concerns with Stash So to get this out of the way, I’m new to trading stocks, and I decided on Stash due to a recommendation from a friend. 

What is concerning me now is the influx of negative reviews on Stash. Some people are claiming that they’re preventing them from transferring stocks, withdrawing money, selling stocks, closing their account, and charging them after they closed their account. 

What steps could I take to prevent running into these issues? 

I’m already considering transferring my assets, but there’s a $75 dollar fee for doing so. Plus some reviews mention certain stocks not being transferred.

And before the keyboard warriors come out, if you’re going to insult me make it constructive, or at least funny. 

Thank you for your advice."
2021-05-27 20:18:50,stocks,"Stash is ok, I got it when I first started but I think it’s pretty limited compared to other brokers. I know some other brokers charge $75 to move your assets, I haven’t had any issues with selling stocks but I also have one in there which I’m planning to sell. Honestly I think there are much better brokers out there with better features."
2021-05-27 22:42:18,stocks,"Stash is really intended for buying and holding long term. They only execute purchase and sale transactions four times a day so terrible if you’re trying to do day trading or volatile stocks. You can link your debit and credit cards and it will round up every purchase and make a transfer once a week, I use that feature and like it a lot, but I just buy a few ETFs in there and do all my other trading on Fidelity."

Additionally I included the stocks that were upgraded today to Bullish or Very Bullish, for comparison.

I want to see how they perform against the overall market. If I had access to Motley Fool recommendations, Cramer's recommendation and so on, I would have created separated sheet for them.

For example for some random stock with 10 million total shares the data i would like to know is below.

I would like to see how many stocks are purchased and are held at various price points, so i can see the distribution.

|Random Stock: ABCDEF - Current Price $65||
|:-|:-|
|Shares|Per Share Purchase Price|
|1million|$10|
|4million|$20|
|4million|$30|
|1million|$60|

Why? I think analyzing the distribution and the change in distribution can provide some interesting investing information.

For example,  another imaginary stock with different distribution

|:-|:-|
|Shares|per Share Purchase Price|
|0.5million|$5|
|0.5million|$10|
|3million|$50|
|6million|$60|

The data between first one and second one paints a different picture.

It could be a way to identify pump and dumps, solid growth stocks, hot new stocks, and everything else.

I'm new on the stockmarket, I'm a novice and not a professional investor, nor do I work in the field.  
I decided to try my hand at trading partly for fun and ofcourse to make a bit extra if I can.

The thing I'm struggling with the most is how to determine what stocks to buy.  
You often see stocks suddenly soar (like AMC atm), or suddenly plummet, but how do you ""predict"" this? I've messed around in some smaller stocks a bit, starting with 100 usd just to try, and on all the trades I made ( I tried 4 over 4 days) I lost money.

Is it just an experience thing? Should I keep trying until I recognize patterns? Are there websites/magazines/whatever I should keep an eye on? Should I religously be checking this reddit?

If your looking for a quick buck be prepared for lots of ups and downs. Also, I wouldn't call these companies ""good"", AMC for example was near bankruptcy and just recently diluted their stock.

The best you can aim for is - for ""good ""stocks is focus on companies that you believe in and trust, its worth reading these companies Earning Reports as these will give you some good guidance on where they are going also it's worth seeing what top analysts are saying (not bloggers).

VOO
QQQ

I'm looking for another ETF that is not apart of Tech to kind of help diversify my holdings. I was wondering if 'XLC' would be a good third ETF. My plan right now is each month put X amount into a single ETF, then the next month put it into the next ETF, etc., and essentially continously put money into all three ETFs.

Not limiting losses is the irresponsible and an destroy years worth of profits.

„It will go up again“ is just a lie that people tell themselves to feel better. Every Investment should be secured by a stop loss that gets adjusted regularly.
Even if the stock goes up at some point, it can take many years to get there. This money is locked away for this period. 
I would take a  10%  loss at any point over potentially waiting a decade. Reinvesting the money (even in a boring etf) is far more profitable.

2021-05-28 12:27:12,stocks,"There is just one reason to own shares: to make money.

If is a stock cannot do that, it’s dead weight and the money better invested in another stock.

If a stock looses a significant amount of its value, usually there is a reason to it. There is no reason to think that the value recovers fast.

But the market is growing for >20 years and so are Index Fonds. That is the Performance that every stock has to compete with. There is no reason to sit on a loss and wait  when there are many options to negate the loss.

In a professional environment,  the Maximum loss decides how many shares will be bought in the first place.

Reacting trends is important to make long term money. And SLs are an important tool to react the right way.

I know there is an ongoing fight between trend following scene and fundamental analysis folk. I guess it’s a valid argument hat the fundamentalists usually jump on the train early and make more money on a promising stock.

But it’s also true that many of them sit on their stocks for years and decades because „fundamentals are good and it’s undervalued“. 

Truth is, good fundamentals are worth nothing if you are the only one noticing it. You need the the trend at some point (usually influenced by fundamentals).
But that might take many years - time that the money would be better spend in trending investments or etf „parking spots“."

2021-05-28 00:00:00,stocks,"Rrp explosion and results On March 17, a little over two months ago, there was no volume at the Fed's RRP window. Nothing. Today, it was almost $400 billion! How do you go from zero to $400 billion in two months? Not only was today's activity at the RRP one of the largest ever, it was also THE largest non-quarter-end, non-year-end print. There's an incredible amount of cash in the Repo market right now! Clearly, the Fed took too much collateral out of the market - or - added too much cash.

And while Powell & Co pretend that they can continue business as usual for years to come, the repo market is not only cracking but banks, full to the gills with inert reserves and which increase by $30 billion every week, are on the verge of pulling a Mr Creosote...

and balking at even a penny of additional liquidity. How the Fed will continue to monetize debt then, when the repo system is now out of collateral, is anyone's guess.

By mid-July, we’ll have even more reserves to absorb due to the debt ceiling, and while a lot of that cash will go to the o/n RRP facility, some of it will chase higher yields in the FX swap market amid a lack of demand for U.S. dollars. Three-month cross-currency bases may flip positive by mid-July, and those implied yields may drag three-month U.S. dollar Libor-OIS slightly negative

Assuming inflation not only continues to rise but accelerates to the upside while bond yields are capped, we have an asymmetric risk to the downside in real yields. Precious metals and miners have long-term inverse correlation to real yields. Said simply, if and when real yields dump, watch Silver and the metals soar. I estimate the time for that scenario to play out in weeks.

Gold rose 24x in the 1970s, silver 36x. Gold rose 8x in the 2000s. Silver jumped 12x. Follow the Smart Money. The rally in precious metals and miners has barely begun and will run for years, imho. Given the amount of currency printed out of thin air, if history is anything to go by, the gains will be enormous, especially in real terms."
2021-05-27 20:18:55,stocks,">Assuming inflation not only continues to rise but accelerates to the upside

I've had a nearly-great CRM (three companies ago), and Salesforce never ever got close to it.  Salesforce is primarily a marketing scheme to con managers into buying it, but it's so tough and herky-jerky to use at the lower levels that the prized data the managers think they'll be getting becomes garbage.  Both companies, over a period of about two to three years each, learned the truth about it, and stopped pushing it.  Sales is what matters, and Salesforce is not the effective tool that a salesperson needs at the tip of the spear to get what will make them more successful.  The other CRM did this, EASILY, but Salesforce won't do it."

Salesforce is a marketing scheme sold to managers who get conned into believing they will be attaining actionable data, but at the base level it's so fucked up to use (I've used it across two sizeable companies) that the data is either incorrect, OR just doesn't go into it at all.

A CRM should be, first and foremost, the liked and appreciated go-to tool in the field for end-users.  Only then should it attempt to compile data for managers.  Instead, managers will try to force end-users to use it that aren't seeing the benefit of Salesforce that they can, and would, see via other CRM's."

Just one of dozens of examples, when we fill out a Safety report in the app it wont show up to someone else using the web version for sometimes hours. Same going the other way this leads to constant sync conflicts. The syncing itself for a single form also takes around 1-3 minutes, and in that time I literally have to sit there and wait. Lightning UI is also missing a load of features that classic has and lots of us rely on those exact features to do our job effectively, so it also causes people to be using different versions.

Because I have profit now, but my average stock cost is now $20 per stock, but if I didn't sell, my average cost would be $10 still.

 Is average cost important?
 Because it seems that this strategy increases the average cost of my stocks every time I sell and buy, and it also gives me less profit every time too.

Stock: ABC $10   My wallet: $10       AVG cost: 0
Buy one, I now have:
     ABC: 1          WALLET: 0$         AVG: $10 per stock

Price goes up, so ABC is now $30
Sell one, I now have:
      ABC: 0.         WALLET:  $30.         AVG: 0

Price goes down, ABC is now $20
Buy one, I now have:
      ABC: 1.         WALLET: $10.      AVG: $20

Was this trade a win? Or was it not worth it because I increased the average cost, thus making room for profit more narrow."

2021-05-28 00:00:00,stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, May 27, 2021 **PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, May 27, 2021**

Stocks traded mixed today, with the S&P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) rising while the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) fell modestly as market participants looked toward the new weekly jobless report. Market participants continue to closely monitor incoming inflation data, though it seems fears that the Federal Reserve will be forced to tighten monetary policy have tempered in recent weeks, with the SPY roughly 3 points away from its record level. 

This week, the indexes have largely consolidated, an encouraging sign following the volatility experienced in the first weeks of May. Market participants continue to look towards incoming economic data to further judge whether inflation will lead to a sustained jump in prices, causing the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates, or be a transitory side-effect as the US economy roars back following the coronavirus-induced recession. Personally, I am in the latter camp and am not concerned about sustained inflation. 

Todd Jablonski, chief investment officer at Principal Global Asset Allocation said, “Inflation has gone from being on no one’s radar screen maybe five years as a lead concern, to now being at the absolute forefront as you see the economy rebound off of COVID lows. There has been a tremendous acceleration in earnings, coupled with massive monetary and fiscal stimulus.”

members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), reiterated their stance that they were not yet concerned that new inflation data would force the Fed to tighten monetary policy sooner than expected. St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said he believed increases in inflation would be “mostly temporary” and that the Fed was “not quite there yet” when it came to discussing tapering its asset purchase program. In separate comments, Kansas City Federal Reserve President Esther George said she did not want the Fed to be “overly reliant on historical relationships and dynamics in judging the outlook for inflation.” 

Richard Clarida, Vice Chairman of the Federal Reserve, also said “there will come a time in upcoming meetings” when the Fed would consider tapering the asset purchase program but that “it is going to depend on the flow of data”. The Fed is currently buying $120 billion a month in government-issued and government-backed securities, and has pledged to continue doing that until the economy is more fully recovered.

This reaffirms the market that the Fed is not on a set timeline when it comes to rolling back current accommodative policies and will, as they have said time and again, wait for concrete data before any considerations are made. This follows a similar statement from Jerome Powell back in April 14, which proves market participants shouldn’t worry about quantitative easing tapering, in my opinion. Powell said, “We will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.”

The Department of Labor’s Weekly Unemployment Report showed jobless claims fell for the fourth straight week to yet another pandemic-era low, an encouraging sign that the labor market is improving following the extremely disappointing April Jobs report, which showed 266,000 new jobs added in the month, far below estimated of more than 1 million and a sharp deceleration in job growth compared to March.

2021-05-28 00:00:00,stocks,"FIGS IPO Debuted Today FIGS, an apparel and lifestyle company for healthcare workers, officially went public today. They mainly sell nicer, more professional looking scrubs that are becoming more of a fashion statement (almost think Lululemon for scrubs).

Net revenue for this company grew to $261 million in 2020 from $110.5 million in 2019. The company grew from $17.6 million in 2017, a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 146%. 

Valuation of $4.6 billion. The IPO priced at $22 a share, which was above the expected range of $16 and $19 a share. It soared out the gate at 36%, reaching a peak of  ~$30.70, currently trading around $29.50.

Did not know this company went IPO today until I got an email from them on their server list. As a healthcare worker and FIGS fanatic I’m excited about this but unsure about the valuation. I do believe they’re a great company and they have a crazy fanbase, almost cult like. Their scrubs are pricey but they have loyal fans and we’ve seen companies with super loyal fans obviously do really well.

What are your thoughts on this IPO?

It’s like a nice pair of Nike or Adidas leggings vs. the cult-like adherents to Lululemon.

Also heads up to this thread: female nurses aren’t the only people who wear scrubs. I’m a male physical therapist and I’ve turned many other PTs and OTs as well as nurses to the figs side. Their doctors lab coats are also super comfy and fashionable.

2021-05-28 00:00:00,stocks,"$GOGO is a Starlink play  I opened a Roth IRA years ago to buy the $TSLA IPO, and I have been diamond hands on that ever since. I was on unemployment at the time, so I couldn’t buy much.

I’m a huge fan of SpaceX and watch every Starship test. Heck, I’ve been thinking about visiting Boca Chica to scope out land for sale. I wish I could own some SpaceX, but I can’t.

I started looking for companies that can benefit from Starlink. I checked ocean shipping. Nope. I didn’t immediately find anything in rail. I haven’t checked highway shipping, yet. But when it came to air, I had some luck.

My criteria were simple. I needed to find a company that did could greatly benefit from satellite broadband by integrating it into their current model. They should not have fixed space assets that compete directly with SpaceX and Starlink. They also need to have a means to manage the shortcomings of Starlink.

Speaking of Starlink shortcomings, population density seems to be the biggest problem. Starlink is crap in cities. For aviation, this means Starlink will be garbage when near an airport: no sat broadband when boarding and landing or flying over a city.

This brings us to $GOGO. They sold off their commercial airline support last December, so now they focus on the private business market. They provide entertainment and data systems for private jets. Like the one the hedgies and your wife’s boyfriend fly in. These aren’t the people that are going to install their own Starlink that came in the mail. Instead, they will expect the folks that manage their system to do it. And that is $GOGO.

$GOGO currently mainly uses 4G cell connections. They have contracts across North America. They recently signed deals for 5G, too. So far as I know, $GOGO isn’t even thinking about Starlink at this point. I may have to write them a letter. But the cell connection is great, too. Remember how Starlink won’t work at the airports? That’s not a problem for $GOGO.

Whether $GOGO knows it or not, they will soon have much faster and cheaper data to offer their rich clients. This is why I think $GOGO is a clear Starlink play. But I’m an ape that lost my ass on $PLTR calls, and this isn’t financial advice.

No cool links.  Here:   [Gogo Inflight Internet - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gogo_Inflight_Internet)

A lot of big name investors believe either hyper inflation is coming, interest rates will be raised / the stocks will take a hit or a scenario where both could theoretically happen.

GOLD?
I was thinking about gold. Though have heard mixed information about gold etfs. I prefer not to buy an actual tangible asset. I don’t have a safe, room to put anything.

Here is my choice. Not a huge surprise but nonetheless:

FB - I think it is the most undervalued FAANG+M stock as of now. Additionally, compared to AAPL, MSFT, GOOG - it is much less mature and has lot more room for growth. I think the data limitations posed by AAPL will not have the major effect that some think.

FB had a great earnings with strong guidance. Analysts have a median price target of $394.75 (+20%) in 12-months with a high of $460.

My broker trades on Xetra (if that is even the way to say this). From my understanding this is the European market exchange, so my question is, how are the markets connected?

The prices seem to be nearly identical as well as the trends (at least when comparing the stocks of the same companies on yahoo finance, Apple for example). The opening hours of the markets are completely different due to the time zones, maybe my question is stupid but I somehow cannot understand how it works.

Would be very grateful if someone could give some further information on that. :)"
2021-05-28 02:39:32,stocks,"I know enough to start answering, provide vague explanation, and basic understanding...., but I don't know enough to take advice from for any financial decisions of this and someone can probably provide better detail. I might have a minor thing or two wrong in my vagueness.

Markets have largely switched over to registered shares of stock that have made them easier to transfer and track ownership. When you go to Xetra you're trading either shares of the company (cross-listed) or you're trading an EDR of the foreign stock. In Apple's case, I'm not sure which it is, but I haven't seen an EDR mentioned. More on EDR later.

In both cases there are institutional investment firms and banks between the markets. They have the unique ability to buy shares in large blocks in one exchange and sell elsewhere. If demand weakens in one market, even a small bit, an institutional firm will buy up shares in the weaker market and sell in the market with stronger demand and even the price between the two markets. They earn a small amount on the price difference, but also take care of the currency conversion. There are competing institutional investment firms doing this, so the margins between the different markets is typically very narrow.

When you see the price on Xetra, you're only seeing the price as if it affected in that exchange. If the institutional firm sees a small difference in demand, they will react (and take a slither of a cut of the difference), and keep things priced nearly the same. The thing to watch out for is sometimes there could be small delays in these actions. If there is a sudden price change in the US market and not in the European market, it might take a few minutes for these institutional forms react and complete trades.  This is also some of the after-market trading you see, so you don't fully know how the other foreign market will react when they open back up, that can lead to some prices shifts when that happens. Apple is traded in many markets across the world in some form.

Of course, USD-EUR currency conversion matters in the middle of this.

&#x200B;

The other thing I mentioned was an EDR, European Depository Receipt. The American version, ADR, American Depository Receipt, has been around in some form since the 1920's.

In this case the stock is actually held by an institutional investing bank on behalf of anyone buying it in an exchange. The depository receipt is a security that represents an actual stock security held by an investment bank. It trades the same as stock and holds the same value.  The big benefit is you would buy, sell, and treat it the same as a domestic asset. If there are any taxes, conversions, or cross-border issues holding the security that is handled more efficiently by the institutional investment bank holding the actual stock security.

You still get the ownership held on your behalf, dividend, and in many cases voting rights.

Of course, any conversion costs or taxes the bank has holding of trading that security with another country will impact the cost of that EDR in your exchange. So if two nations have weird laws impacting the institutional trade of these stocks cross-borders, it becomes a cost barrier to them keeping the pricing precisely even across exchanges. That small difference happens from the institutional investor needing to make a certain value on the cross-border trades to handle those costs, when they exist.

Americans and Europeans, typically play well together.

On my side of the pond, I own shares in ABB. It is actually an ADR traded on the NYSE, so the actual share is held by an investment bank, but there is a depository receipt I hold in my name that gives me the rights to one of the shares they hold.

&#x200B;

China plays unique. They are fearful of any sort of foreign control and regulated heavily.  They have slowly been opening up, but all of these growing companies want access to capitol. 

Some companies have set up off-shore companies that invest into the Chinese company through a VIE, variable interest entity that makes a lump sum purchase into the Chinese stocks where there is no voting rights to the shareholder.

China has been allowing direct foreign ownership of lower-class shares that do not have voting rights in a few select exchanges. Hong Kong has long been a financial market that acts as a intermediary trading between China and the rest of the world. They are allowed to trade one kind of these shares that is a bit easier to trade.

So I own some BABA, Alibaba. It is an ADR that is actually buying a share in Alibaba's off-shore company in the Cayman Island's that makes a direct investment into BABA through a VIE. I can't actually directly buy stock in Alibaba, just a promise they will give me my cut and I can sell my stake through the off-shore holding company.

If I set up an account in Hong Kong or Shanghai, I can trade in those exchanges directly, but only certain lower class shares that give me no voting rights as a foreigner

I don't buy more than 5% China. They need to open up more and give shareholders voting rights and play well with the rest of the world."
2021-05-28 01:35:31,stocks,"Thanks, this helped a lot :) So, in theory if there is a huge spike in apple's stock (AAPL), it should not directly impact the one listed on XETRA (APC.DE)?"
2021-05-28 03:17:36,stocks,"Very helpful answer! This answers the question perfectly! So, it would make sense for me (trading on XETRA) to wait for the opening hours of the American market and see how the prices will move, as the trading volume on XETRA is no where near the American market (and therefor the American market will have a greater impact on the price)?"
2021-05-28 05:52:05,stocks,"The opposite, a huge spike in the value of AAPL should be reflected almost exactly in APC.DE. if the Börse is closed, it will update on open."
2021-05-28 14:11:07,stocks,"Maybe, you should watch it for awhile.  I'm more use to you guys having already been open when I wake up :)

In some cases it might not matter. European investors probably have some indication if things are perceived as better or slightly riskier than the day before. The same thing American investors will react to when markets open. It really just becomes a series of small ups and downs to see if one market perceives the price a little lower or higher.

What I would watch out for are quarterly reporting days. Many report at end of market in the US, which means the European market would trade first knowing the results. A few companies release in the morning, when the European markets might still be open. I would just make sure you get the information you need before trading."

If you extrapolate their Q1 bookings and assume equal revenue each quarter, it's about $2.5 Billion a year. Take 30% of that and it's only about $750 million, which is very low for a company at their valuation.

Also, consider how quickly trends move in the gaming world. Some of the biggest games like Fortnite, PUBG, etc are a fraction of what they used to be. Club Penguin used to be the game all the kids played but now its defunct. Bulls will try to argue ""Roblox will stay relevant because of its 3rd party creators"", but I don't buy that. Plenty of 3rd party creation platforms like Newgrounds were once huge but lost their spot. Roblox has its limitations as a platform as well."

2021-05-27 20:45:18,stocks,"I don’t know where you got the 30% number from, but their S1 states that app store fees cost about 1/4th of their revenue. That’s huge, and they’re definitely looking at what Epic’s lawsuit is going to potentially change.

The rest is spent on running the business and paying developers to create more content — but that payout amount is completely under their control, same as any other platform that pays creators. There’s no reason to assume that payouts won’t be adjusted, it can and does change, see YouTube.

Assuming no revenue growth is pure conjecture when they have yet to show signs of flatlining. I do agree that the growth rate is not sustainable in the long term, which is why expansion is their priority.

There’s no reason a YouTube-of-games can’t be successful and long lived. I’m not sure why you’re bringing up single games as relevant examples, when they’re not not competing with in-house game developers. Newgrounds is a very bizarre comparison — different monetization model, based on tech that no longer even exists (flash), and had a very limited amount of devices it could run on.

I’m not trying to convince you either way, but I’m not understanding your reasoning."

However,

JOAN is looking exceedingly undervalued at the moment, and could definitely be one to look in to. This is one that I found in a thread on here a week or two ago, and I ended up opening a small position (50 shares). I like the risk/reward because it is more about JOAN coming up to a reasonable valuation instead of somehow drastically increasing business. 

They also just announced that they will be paying a dividend of .10 per share (.40 per year) starting June IIRC. This places the yield at around 2.7% which all in all is not bad. The fact that they have decided to start paying out a dividend is a good sign to me because it tells me that they are expecting cash flow to increase.


A few others to look at: ABR, CRSR, BFI, UTZ, NEGG (Market cap on NEGG hasn't updated on many services yet, it's actually around 4.5 to 5bln, not 70mln).

NEGG likely won't 10x as it is just too niche of a website at this point, but the potential for a decent multiple is still there.

Obviously do your own research on the companies you buy. These positions are not large positions in my portfolio, the largest being under 2.5% currently. My investment strategy follows value investing pretty closely, but I do have a relatively high risk tolerance as I am fairly young."

I have personally purchased GE stock as I believe it is headed for long term growth. 

20 Year and 5 year Charts for GE shows the stock having performed a “double bottom.” 

On both charts, the 50 MA has bottomed and is beginning to retrace upward. It will soon perform a golden cross with the 200 MA, a very strong sign of growth. 

Both charts show MACD significantly above the line. 

GE has broken a previous resistance level of $13; the next appears to be $15; the next levels would be 17.50, 20, and 22.50. 

Based on these signals, I purchased, looking for the stock to break through the $15 resistance level soon.

**DESCRIPTION**

Charge Point is an electric infrastructure company that designs, develops & manufactures hardware & software solutions for electric vehicles at large. It offers a portfolio of hardware, software, & services for corporate, public, & residential customers. Company was founded in 2007 and operates in 14 countries.

**History**

In June 2017, $CHPT took over 9,800 electric vehicle charging spots from GE. Prior to that point, $CHPT managed 34,900 charging stations across Mexico, Australia, Canada, and the United States.

The current CEO and president as of 2018 is Pasquale Romano. On November 28, 2018, $CHPT raised $240 million. At the time, $CHPT maintained 57,000 charging spots. In 2019, VW's [Electrify America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrify_America) and $CHPT agreed to provide common access to their US customers. Company reached 100,000 chargers in September 2019, while adding more than 2,000 charging locations per month. Currently $CHPT offers 132k charging station network. Which accounts for 72% market share of total level 2 charging in North America. New entity was formed from Legacy Charge Point combined with Switchback late Feb 2021;

**What is the business model of CHPT?**

Charge Point sells hardware & software (equipment & network subscriptions) to property owners. The company doesn't own the majority of stations. It doesn't monetize energy. It only monetizes the driver, thus capital light business model.

$CHPT enjoys the [largest share](https://investors.chargepoint.com/why-invest/default.aspx) of Level 2 chargers in the US. Data from [AFDC](https://afdc.energy.gov/fuels/electricity_locations.html#/analyze?fuel=ELEC) shows that $CHPT wields the largest market share at 42.8K L2 chargers out of 92.8K total of which 11.5K are ""non-networked"", carving \~53% market share of ""networked"" chargers. No 2 competitor is Tesla with 16.8K, No3 largest, is SemaCharge Network at 5.2K, followed by Blink with 3.1k which is 4th. In terms of L3 'Superchargers', where Tesla leads the way with 10.7k of 19.6k units. $CHPT is competitive with 1.5k with only Electrify America coming in higher at 2.5k. Superchargers account for \~22% of the market pie, L2 \~75% and L1, \~3% of market share. People keep reiterating that L3 is the future and no one should bother with L1 & L2. Well, that's wrong. L3 is obviously the option for the highways, commercial and service transportation. Even larger segment though is found at: parking lots, restaurants, cinemas, sports arenas, malls, corporate offices and other mass conglomerations. This is where L2 comes to play much cheaper than L3 to install, but with longer charging times - perfect fit.

**Products**

Comprehensive Hardware Portfolio Delivers - Solutions for every use case, all vehicle types and brands - High efficiency in power and footprint - Modular, scalable, secure architecture designed for serviceability- Unparalleled quality; advanced testing (vehicle, functional, climate, environment) for long-term reliability - Options for site hosts to use custom branding

**Software Enables** \- Control of who can use stations and when - All vehicles to get charged on time - Multiple vehicles to share power - Drivers to get in line when ports are occupied- Roaming integrations with other charging networks

**Challengers**

* $VLTA; Claims to go beyond just charging EVs, their chargers are used for ads and their charger placement is based on data analytics in collaboration with $PLTR. When company compares itself to the competition, they do it all - they own the gear, they sell the electricity, they provide software and networks, they do fancy data things, they do advertising. The things they don't do, are manufacture and sell the chargers. They cherry-pick a bunch of stats to show that their chargers have better ""engagement"" but given they only have 1.7k Level 2s & 6 L3. It's like chargers-as-billboards, selected to prime locations. *Anyone can replicate it, if it provides substantial revenue boost, competitors will emulate it*.
* SemmaConnect: Company boasts 3rd largest market share of L2 chargers. SemmaConnect also manufactures chargers and sell software. SemaConnect chargers are OCPP compliant. Sema appears not to have a L3 offering, nor do they appear to offer sales to individuals (single-family residential).
* $EVGO; EVgo claims to have made the first 150kW and 350kW L3 chargers, and base their business largely on L3 chargers. AFDC data says they only have 403 L2s but 1.4k L3 which garners 4th market share. Company also offers drivers a membership for reduced charging rates (\~0.04/min assuming you spend 7.99/month) and they have integrated Tesla connectors on their newer L3. EVgo also has a nationwide infrastructure roll-out deal with GM and are entirely powered by renewables. What differentiates the company is the L3 focus.
* $BLNK: Overhyped POP stock. Blink sells L2 and L3 chargers to business and individuals. Claims to operate on an owner/operator model. From EC:*""The Company made continued progress with its owner/operator strategy; the number of commercial Blink-owned charging stations contracted or deployed during the quarter grew by 51% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year period.""*
* $VWAGY Subsidiary:(Electrify America): L3 focused company, it enjoys 2.5k L3 chargers. EM also sells a L2 for the home. EM offers an app, membership for drivers with a monthly fee that gets you a good discount on their charging costs. The membership and cost to charge suggests that they own their chargers. EM also have an electric vehicle subscription service and have some relationships with Jeep and Hyundai. All its reports seem to be released to the California Air Resources Board. Company doesn't appear to build their own chargers, instead relying on procurement, using third-party hardware and software.

**Near Term Catalysts**

In relation to upcoming US government infrastructure bill: ""AlixPartners estimates $300 billion will be needed to build out a global charging network to accommodate the expected growth of EVs by 2030, including $50 billion in the U.S. alone.""

It's not too late to make bets on upcoming infrastructure bill. Yes you can dabble into construction firms and commodity plays, but you don't know which companies will win lucrative contracts and sizes of those contracts. Well the biggest companies you might say? It's not that clear cut. What is clear cut, is that the focal point of this infrastructure bill is transition to renewable energy and overhaul of pivotal infrastructure. $CHPT has the most experienced (14yrs) company with largest manufacturing capacity, technical know how and ability to take on large scale projects like, building hundreds of thousands of charging stations across all states (500k by 2030). Oh yeah one more thing, former $CHPT board member is in current administration.

That's only US. $CHPT operates infrastructure in the hub of world's renewable energy aka Europe. (Also, Canada, Australia, UK, Mexico among other places) You find yourself at the erection of the infrastructure that you and your kids will be utilizing down the road. Just like, railways, roads, telcoms and internet.

**Long Term Catalysts**

\- Fossil fuel bans - Transit electrification dates - Incentive programs - All major auto OEM brands committed to electric + Further EV cost reductions with advances in battery technology.

$CHPT Growth Directly Proportional to EV Penetration, $CHPT Estimated $1B Revenue at 3% EV Penetration.

**Miscellaneous**

$CHPT Apple Store rating: 4.6.

$CHPT also has the #1 bestselling home charging station on Amazon with hundreds of 5 star reviews.

$CHPT offers access to hundreds of thousands of places to charge with one account via proprietary app.

In collaborations with Daimler, Toyota, BMW, Siemens etc.

No1 choice for Fortune 500 companies. Customers include: Google, Target, IKEA, NASA, GM, Pepsico, Disney, McDonalds, FedEx, Stanford etc.

Shareholders lock up period ends on September 1st.

**MOAT**

* First Mover Advantage (With 14 years of experience in a nascent industry, this is where big contracts will go)
* Asset light business model ( Selective ownership of charge stations, outsources maintenance & responsibilities to the owner)
* Economies of Scale ( $CHPT has largest manufacturing capacity)
* Network Effect ( \~75% of charging network market share & operations in 14 countries)

**CONCLUSION**

All in all $CHPT stock is a pure EV exposure, with light CapEx business model. Company is the ecosystem player with defensible MOATs, recurring revenue streams and visibility. $CHPT finds itself in ESG friendly category and attracts premium valuation due to penetrance in multiple domains: EV Ecosystem (Hardware), Software Powered Solutions and Energy Technology.  Yes most of its network is L2 chargers, but it's where most of the money is to be made. As users go to restaurants, malls, sports events/concerts, office, cinema, universities or just a Parking Lot! There will be L2 charger not L3 due to: Charger Cost Basis/Time Parked. Pretty straightforward formula.

**Why am I interested in $CHPT?**

Because it's an entrenched leader with tremendous experience in a nascent industry.

Because it's a clever business model based on light assets which will subsequently offer high margins 5 years from now. And is literally replacement of GAS stations no matter what happens! And is a home ""GAS station"".

Because EVs are the future and I am catching the momentum and inevitable supremacy and prevalence of charging stations.

A small market cap in the market that will explode no matter what.

This is really well rounded company with superb fundamentals & \~13% institutional ownership, what's going to happen to the stock when institutions commence adoption of it? Let me use a technical term you''ll understand, the valuation will go - bananas.

Average target price $38.21"
2021-05-28 10:48:16,stocks,"I'm definitely interested in the idea of CHPT but I have some doubts about long term sustainability. 

I was under the assumption they operated charge stations like gas stations, taking a cut off the top but it sounds like they sell stations to property owners for upfront cash? Will there ever be a point where the needed number of charge stations is reached and sales drop? I guess they could keep upgrading and selling replacement stations. 

Am I off base here?"

Lloyd’s Bank (American ADR - LYG) released the following statement in their 2021 Shareholder Event call last week regarding the opportunity to pay an additional dividend in 2021 beyond the maximum allowable set by the UK government in response to the Covid crisis. 

“Regarding our dividend. Last year, following a request to all banks by the Prudential Regulation Authority, the Group suspended dividends on ordinary shares and cancelled the final dividend for 2019. These decisions were not taken lightly and I'm sure will have come as a disappointment to you, our shareholders.

However, our capital position has remained strong as a result and, following the PRA announcement in December, the Board was therefore able to recommend a total ordinary dividend of 0.57 pence per share - the maximum allowable within the PRA guidelines.

We recognise the importance of the dividend to many of our shareholders. The PRA has said that they will consider their guidance on 2021 dividends before banks announce their half-year results, so the Board expects to be in a position to discuss interim dividends when it reviews the performance of the business for the first half of the year. Our position on quarterly dividends will also be confirmed at this time.

The Board remains committed to future capital returns. In 2021, subject to regulatory guidance, the Board intends to grow the dividend from 2020, in line with the Group's progressive and sustainable ordinary dividend policy.”

https://www.proactiveinvestors.co.uk/LON:LLOY/Lloyds-Banking-Group/rns/975557

The Prudential Regulation Authority will release an update to their guidance requiring UK banks to scrap dividends throughout 2020 and 4Q 2019 sometime this summer. Currently a maximum allowable dividend of 0.47p is set for 2021. However the PRA is expected to either increase this amount or allow banks to reinstate unrestricted dividends. Although unrestricted dividends will most likely occur in 2022, the opportunity for additional dividends in 2021 and a large increase in yield beginning in 2022 could be a catalyst for LYG to cross the $3 threshold and touch $4 around the time the updated guidance and dividend plan is released. 

Additional info from Q1 2021:

Lloyd’s CET1 ratio is 16.4% before dividends and 16.2% after, well ahead of the bank’s target of around 12.5% and regulatory requirements around 11%.

Lloyd’s released approximately $460M from their impairment reserve that was created in response to the Covid crisis. $3,740M remains in the reserve. 

Lloyd’s UK banking peers (Barclays, HSBC, NatWest) are in similar positions."

For everyone else, this will take a couple thousand off of MSRP, which is different than invoice price. Invoice price is dealer cost.


As someone who sold cars for Ford,  I can assure you,  the X Plan is nowhere close to ""dealer cost"".  
The X plan is the lowest rung of discounts and is typically reserved for friends and family members of a Ford Employee.  I.e. i know a guy that works at Ford, lemme get a discount plz. 

A-plan (current Ford factory employees), D plan (current Ford dealership employees) and z plan (retired Ford factory employees) are significantly cheaper than x plan.  


When you use one of the employee plans,  you have no negotiating power(i.e. ""no haggle""). 
Its true,  Each invoice has the X/D/A price printed on it,  but *This is not the price they paid for the car*.    
They'll gladly show you this invoice and show you how much you're saving vs the ""sticker price"", but nobody has ever paid sticker price for a car.  The ""thousands off MSRP"" is a gimmick, nothing more.  

Even when they show you the invoice, they're probably lying.  Its the ole switcharoo, they'll get a similar car thats more expensive and show you the ""invoice"" and the ""x plan discount"" vs the MSRP.   You can print this for any car on the lot, I've personally used it to show someone ""what a great deal they're getting"". 

Bottom line,  If you think the dealership is making $0 off of you, you're just the kind of fool they want to sell a car to.

The dealer has a set amount they take off the top of every vehicle they sell.  This number varies from dealership to dealership, but its usually between $500-$1000.  As a sales person, they dont pay you commission on this money.  My dealership called it a reserve, as in, i reserve $750 for myself, fuck you very much.  
As a sales person, my commission was 25% on profit AFTER the reserve, with a minimum commission of $100/unit (aka minis).  The only car we were making minis off of was the focus (we called them the fuck-us, bc we made a mini on them).  A ""pounder"" was a car we made $1,000 off of, as in this idiot bought the car at first pencil (the first bullshit price to start the negotiation) and i made a 4 pounder ($4,000).  This happened once in my car sales career (which only happened once to me). For what it's worth  I made a 2 pounder off of one of the 2 X Plan deals I sold. 

Even if they don't get you on the price (they will), they can still make money off of the back end.  
The  difference  between the interest rate you actually qualify for and the interest you pay is all dealer profit.  Most dealerships almost always get AT LEAST 2%. I fucking worked there and they still tried to pull this shit on me (I got it down to 1%). 
 Most car salesmen don't even get to see the rate (its the sales manager and finance guys job to fuck you on your interest rate).  
X plan cars don't qualify for factory incentivized interest rates (i.e. ford truck month's 0% for 60 months or 2,500 ""cashback""), so you'll pay market rate (plus at least 2%). 

Car salesmen and dealers have a knack for making customers *FEEL* like they got a great deal, thats how they make themselves seem like the good guy. I can assure you, the house always wins."

I have never, in my entire career met a person who claimed to be an expert negotiator on car deals that actually was one, outside of industry professionals. Like sure grandpa bill.

If you want X-plan and don't want to buy stock you can also join certain clubs (Mustang club of America, EAA, etc,) and qualify.

The benefit of it now is many dealers have a markup on everything due to the parts supply chain issues, and they have no incentive to deal too much. I was at a Ford dealer yesterday just to window shop, and the GM flat out told me there's a $5k dealer mark-up on every car they have in stock.

2021-05-28 01:01:07,stocks,You won’t save a couple thousand on the Mach E with X plan. For a premium it’ll be in the $800 range off MSRP.
2021-05-28 01:01:49,stocks,"When I worked at a Ford dealership, the friends/family discount was pretty trash, so was the employee discount. 

You’d get a better deal with online prices since they were, at the time, 3-4K off of msrp. Most of the deals we made were losing money for the dealership, obviously not for Ford though. They really just want your business on the back end, service dept made about 13mil annually."
2021-05-28 01:07:21,stocks,"$120 bucks huh. Jokes on them, my Ford only cost $100!"
2021-05-28 01:46:07,stocks,Ford has something called the a plan  Which dealers don't like even talk about

2021-05-28 11:52:26,stocks,That discount was probably introduced when Ford went public in 1900's and they forgot adjust it for inflation since then lmao
2021-05-27 21:28:39,stocks,better off just buying 2 year used.  Sometimes dealers price the used ones high so you think you might as well buy the new...
2021-05-28 08:38:56,stocks,Can confirm.  Used to work for Ford.  This is commonly called “get you through the door marketing.”

2021-05-27 20:32:19,stocks,"That is not correct if you are talking about MSRP. X-plan runs about 10% off of MSRP though it is not available in Raptors, 350's and above. If you aren't a good bargainer it is a very good deal."

2021-05-28 01:43:03,stocks,"So, quick food for thought, I have worked for about 12 different manufacturers now between motorcycles and cars and the closest to 20% over invoice I have seen is a niche luxury car company.

Paying invoice for a Subaru is like $800-$1500 off depending on the model. Some motorcycles are only a couple hundred dollars.

..If so, where?"
2021-05-28 11:10:42,stocks,"I never understood the idea of buying a car for so cheap the dealer makes no money. 

You want a new car. You got to multiple dealerships, you buy the car that has what you want the most at the best price? Why do you care what the dealership makes? If you're worried about being scammed, check competitive prices at other dealerships.

You can still get a good deal where both you and dealerships win"
2021-05-27 23:12:22,stocks,"I believe you have to be an EAA member for a certain amount of time first, though I can't remember how long, maybe 3 or 6 months?

What's the invoice on a 60k truck?"
2021-05-28 07:10:49,stocks,It's .4% off the invoice plus $240. Not .4 off MSRP
2021-05-27 22:59:56,stocks,"It really depends on which CS rep you end up with when it comes to getting the discount applied, I went through the friggin wringer getting my applied a while back -- I had just bought it so I didn't have it for a statement and it took several attempts at proving ownership (they finally accepted the purchase execution email) before they applied it. It was worth it though, it comes to a nice discount and my one share is up quite a bit as well."

2021-05-27 23:29:46,stocks,"Hate to break it, but getting the best deal has nothing to do with invoices, dealer holdbacks, or any other manufacturer incentives. It has everything to do with the amount of research a buyer is willing to do before stepping foot on a lot. Do you think I care what a dealer paid for or has in a vehicle? I just go to the Internet and see what the car I want is selling for and viola! Have a car to trade in? Same concept applies when I am trying to get the most money. Most of the real dealing happens before you ever walk into a dealership."
2021-05-28 00:11:21,stocks,I buy a new dually every 2-3 years but thats about 60-90k miles for me
2021-05-28 02:22:10,stocks,"Used to do this every model year since the resale was so high for a truck with 15,000 on it.  Especially if you buy it with the employee discount.  Used to lower ownership costs quite a bit"
2021-05-27 21:44:31,stocks,"I had a terrible experience with a 2013 Focus and will never give Ford my money again. Unfortunately. If you are curious, look up how FANTASTIC those dual clutch transmissions worked, right off the lot, when obviously they didn't seem to know how to make them. Took them a couple years to get it down I guess."

2021-05-28 01:19:29,stocks,"This is not true. They get you a better than advertised price, but it's not betrer than dealer invoice minus .4%. it's also sometimes not even better than what you could negotiate yourself pretty easily."
2021-05-27 20:55:20,stocks,This was a nice find when I got my Volvo. We had a family membership and it knocked another 500 off!
2021-05-28 04:54:05,stocks,"If you have the time as I have. You can use Costco to negotiate between a few dealers. Alternatively, when you find the dealer you like then you have a relationship. I found a VW/Sub dealer that somehow always beats any price on any competition I’ve thrown their way. Even after going back and forth haggling. It’s insane. It took a month though to find a good dealership."
2021-05-27 20:25:00,stocks,Yeah They are confusing invoice with MSRP. A-plan saves me around $3k on my F-150.
2021-05-28 03:28:57,stocks,Why do they invoice you a lower price instead of just sending you  the MRSP price by invoice? I'm genuinely confused why is there a huge difference between the two. Isn't invoice price you just simply emailing or contacting them for a budget on the car that you are interested in?
2021-05-27 21:51:17,stocks,$120 is $120 unless you lose $120 in stock.
2021-05-27 22:03:17,stocks,"Prices like this will be set. If you ask for a discount,  then say oh and am a share holder, you wont get a further discount. Unless you are still above the shareholder price. On fords invoices it has prices set already for things like this, employees etc."

The guy like you - that comes in with his chest puffed to “haggle” is tricked into thinking he won. Trust me. You pay more than the rest of us."

I did it a few years ago. I called the dealership with model and colors and asked what's the lowest price you can give me that for? The kid on the phone rattled off a number that was way below the holiday sale price in the paper and I hurried to the store.

 I told the salesman what happened and he about shit himself. He played every possible game to try to get me to switch models, add upgrades, etc so he could put me back on the sticker price. I stuck to the number I was quoted. It took three hours and a bogus finance contract (I paid that off a couple of days later) but I took it home.

Three years later and the book value is still only about $1K below what I paid. It might even have gone up in this market."

 But yet iphone is an overpriced piece of plastic with logo on it. It's a company that doesn't respect their customers, just their money. Why do you think apple is fighting the ""right to fix""? 

Just because it's popular, it doesn't mean it's good. 

There is a reason why Ford's stock is a penny stock. Just saying. The only reason why F went up in value is solely because new influx of new retail investors looking for recognizable brands. 

Ford is a shit company that should have gone bankrupted years ago."

2021-05-27 21:36:57,stocks,"Did some digging the other day on restaurant and retail stocks to see what are some overlooked picks that could really benefit from the stimulus checks and economic reopening. Came across a good one over here - could anyone please give me your 2 cents?  
  
NASDAQ: RAVE:  
  
\- Franchises two pizza brands with 160+ stores across the US and 30+ in international locations  
  
\- Full franchise business model to save on costs  
  
\- Brand new management with a track record of bringing franchises back from the dead  
  
\- Posted strong profits and cash flows in 2020 despite COVID - profits up more than 6x yoy by the end of 2020 with net cash balance sheet of $4+ million  
  
The company has been served a delisting notice by NASDAQ multiple times yet it comes back every time so I have a good feeling on this one. It's pretty cheap right now trading around $1 ish but with the upcoming economic reopening, I'm hopeful they will break $2 at the minimum. Restaurants are bound to have more business this summer with the vaccine rollout, stimulus checks, economic reopening and what not, which means more earnings and cash for RAVE on top of what they already have despite a dreadful year for small businesses. Publicity is what their restaurants need and this cash is gonna give management much more flexibility on improving and growing their brand in the long-run... Any thoughts?"

When you zoom down into the subatomic world, weird shit happens for reasons that no one can explain. Combine that with the fact that they will need a new way of programming and logic.

AMC Entertainment stock rocketed more than 50% higher on Thursday before paring gains a bit. But this time around, fellow meme stock GameStop wasn’t along for the ride.  
AMC shares (ticker: AMC) closed up 36% to $26.52, its highest close since May 12, 2017, according to Dow Jones Market Data. GameStop stock (GME) was up 4.9%, to $254.13. The performance gap likely isn’t due to differing views about the companies’ business prospects, but rather supply-and-demand quirks that are exaggerated by short interest, social-media excitement, and momentum-based trading activity.  
Shares of GameStop and AMC—both hugely popular among retail investors on Reddit and highly shorted by some Wall Street funds—have seen a resurgence together in recent weeks. Options activity has also picked up for both, according to Susquehanna analyst Christopher Jacobson.

Could it become an issue next month? Yes. Could it become an issue next year? Also yes. 

The only thing that I've been guessing is that you will probably see a late 2018 like stretch within the next 12-18 months (to cover all of 2022).

2021-05-27 22:53:55,stocks,"Not really. For ex. Let’s say income tax brackets change every $10K and the rate goes from 10% to 50%. Let’s say you made $50K for the year. Your first $10K will be taxed at 10%, your next $10K will be taxed at 20% and so on. The Tax Rate isn’t applied flat on your entire income for the year.

To answer your question, if made that $20 within one year, then it is taxed as regular income. How much tax you pay would just depend on rest of your income for the year. If you made $20 after holding it for a year, you will still get taxed, but much lower (again depending on the rest of your income for the year)."

Yes, Costco has a premium. That's what you get for a reliable business model built around 90%+ membership retention, strong moat and quality leadership/culture.

2021-05-28 00:34:52,stocks,Thanks for responding 😀
2021-05-28 04:21:56,stocks,Watch Peter Lynch Lectures
2021-05-28 05:21:50,stocks,Hi have an ebook available on my website [www.ukbitcoinblog.com](https://www.ukbitcoinblog.com) and I post regular analysis and provide an indicator I've developed for Tradingview.
2021-05-27 20:04:25,stocks,We're you able to get your shares at 22?
2021-05-27 20:14:20,stocks,I was not.  It opened up at $28 and I had a limit for $22.50. I ended up passing when I noticed it didn’t fill a few hours later.
2021-05-27 20:29:11,stocks,I ended up getting 4 shares at 28 and it's grown today so far no regrets haha
2021-05-27 22:08:11,stocks,"All of the faang is a bit overvalued but the only company of the bunch I like more than apple is amazon. 

Apple is very different. They are the only company in the bunch that vertically develop their products from chips to hardware to software. They have full control on their hardware and software and of the bunch are the favorite consumer brand. 

Facebook and google are both purely software that take ppls data and their core business model is ads. 

Amazon at this point is basically trying to grow into a huge monopoly that does everything. 

Microsoft if a very enterprise centered company."
2021-05-28 13:20:04,stocks,Are you talking about Fidelity Spire or a different app?
2021-05-28 13:24:23,stocks,"Looks like you can only sell fractional shares, not buy them:

> Orders containing fractional shares must be entered as a closing sell order for the full fractional (decimal) quantity owned. Please edit your quantity and resubmit your order."
2021-05-28 10:47:25,stocks,Their properly optioned ICE F150 is good to 13-14k lbs. Extended-pack lightning caps at 10k.
2021-05-28 12:00:40,stocks,I suppose I’ve been misled
2021-05-28 12:09:57,stocks,"It doesn't bother me. I know the difference between 10k and 14k is 40% but I really don't think many people will be using that extra 2 tons. I'm getting the tri-motor Cybertruck which has 14k towing and the insane 0-60. But honestly, if they made a dual motor @ 10k towing with the tri-motor range I would have gotten that."
2021-05-28 13:20:42,stocks,When can you order it?
2021-05-28 14:05:14,stocks,"I put my order in for the CT months ago. I expect MAYBE some units produced in 2021. Production to ramp through 2022, and my delivery MAYBE late 2023. It's because there are just so many reservations ahead of mine."
2021-05-28 09:22:45,stocks,There is no point to going to ev at this point. Current vehicles are just prototypes. And the electrical grid will NOT support 10% ev at this point!
2021-05-27 23:44:51,stocks,"Charging 5 cents a bag and bankrupting people over GAS PRICES to get to work, working 2 or 3 jobs is criminal. That's not the way to get any issues under control..  period."
2021-05-28 00:23:10,stocks,"Yes, but that can be fixed down the line. Once the climates gone, it’s gone."
2021-05-28 00:27:16,stocks,"Bankruptcy and someone's life shattered can be ""fixed down the line""?  Give your head a shake... the ridiculous price of fuel in North America is disgusting.. I heard countless times a day choices between food and gas for people working minimum wage. There isn't bussing or commuting options for people out of town......"
2021-05-28 00:29:38,stocks,"Yes it would be terrible for one generation’s life  to be harder, but if we don’t take action now every subsequent generation is going to be in a significantly worse position. I don’t know about you, but when I’d rather ensure a positive future for this planet even if it comes at the expense of those living today (myself included)."
2021-05-28 00:38:58,stocks,"...  Again. Why would you chastise the working wo(man)... go after heavy polluters for christ sakes.. my husband works in finances and it is ALARMING the number of people suffering financially,  especially right now during a pandemic! They need relief, not another fake tax for government to get richer !  End of discussion."
2021-05-28 02:15:38,stocks,"Yes. I fully agree with you. The government needs to help its citizens, but I would prefer if they could also find a way to not include fossil fuels. Just because there is a pandemic does not put climate change on hold. Thus I’m all for government help, but do believe that has prices should be high because I would rather have governments use this as an opportunity to push for more renewable and green technologies and infrastructure."
2021-05-27 21:27:48,stocks,I never said anything like that. You are the one saying it.
2021-05-28 01:08:23,stocks,"that's funny must have been another /u/brazucadomundo who said these things:  


>Pushing up production costs just adds a marginal impact in the sale price and even more marginal reduction in the demand. People react very little to the increase of gas prices.  I never heard anyone cancelling trip plans because gas got too expensive. 

&#x200B;

>Shell just releases to the open air CO2 during the production and distribution. 

&#x200B;

>I don't accept anyone from being bullied by the brutality of the majority.

&#x200B;

>If you push higher costs to big corps to produce oil, that will bump their prices just marginally and people will just say 'meh'."
2021-05-28 01:24:01,stocks,This doesn't have anything to do with what you said.
2021-05-28 01:28:26,stocks,lmao
2021-05-28 03:19:11,stocks,"Woah great read love it and thanks for taking your time on that! I've been interested in all of this basically since I saw that documentary about David Attenborough. 

We need renewable energy or sustainable energy in every way possible. Fossil fuels won't last too long I think!"
2021-05-28 03:17:09,stocks,Okay thanks!
2021-05-28 00:21:07,stocks,"So, I've continued on my dive into $LAD.  To continue I looked at AutoNation ($AN), another competitor.  In main I was curious about debt ratios.  AutoNation's growth numbers are less impressive than Lithia Motors', but they do have more long-term and better Free Cash Flow numbers.  

What I'm coming to find is that automotive retailers tend to carry a lot of debt, but interestingly enough some of that high debt is due to Floor Planning Debt.  This is a form of revolving short-term debt by which they acquire vehicle inventories.  The loans are paid as the inventory is sold, and the credit is ""recycled"" for new inventory.  

Based on the 2020 numbers, Lithia Motors' short term assets do exceed the short term liabilities.  Compared to the long term liabilities, the short term assets are greater.  They will pay down roughly $200m of the long-term liabilities in 2021, then $500m in 2022-23.

The work continues...."
2021-05-27 21:31:47,stocks,What about 2 years from now?
2021-05-28 16:38:13,stocks,Let me check my crystal ball.... Wait a sec.
2021-05-28 08:37:42,stocks,"Amazon has a mixed inventory which means that one guys fake shampoo gets mixed with all the other sellers real shampoos. 

So its like “you can buy this, but theres a 20% chance its a fake.” 

Maybe its different depending on where you live though. Im in Miami area, so maybe thats why we have different experiences?"
2021-05-27 23:29:22,stocks,"Oh, I agree! But if the tax bill is big enough, it could cause a selling cascade in your portfolio to pay for it, depending on how liquid you are elsewhere. Anyway, still a good problem to have."
2021-05-28 08:48:08,stocks,Maybe. I'm in Canada lol
2021-05-28 14:28:34,stocks,It's comments like this that give me conviction in owning PTON.
2021-05-28 14:26:18,stocks,Love that you can filter classes by music genre and even see the artists that are played in each session.
2021-05-28 14:27:48,stocks,"Show us your puts then, chief."
2021-05-28 14:36:40,stocks,I don't fuck with options lol. Part of my strategy of not doing dumb shit.
2021-05-28 14:39:51,stocks,"With investing takes like yours, it's for the best."
2021-05-28 03:37:23,stocks,"Just look at the forecast CAGR of Auto AV industry , over 500 Billion in 5 years.

INTEL Mobileye is the leading provider of ADAS systems, and is likely to extend this position to autonomous driving systems as well.

In this regards to HD maps, the most scalable approach is to build crowdsourced maps by using data gathered by consumer vehicles. Currently, Intel Mobileye is the only one which is pursuing this route, and is already mapping millions of km of road per day. Note that HD means that standard maps such as Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (or Apple) Maps are not sufficient."
2021-05-28 09:54:37,stocks,What will the stock buy back do ?
2021-05-27 20:53:42,stocks,Then what would you call reflation?
2021-05-28 17:14:29,stocks,Their competitive advantage is the ability to out meme the other computer equipment manufacturers. It'll probably go up. I would genuinely be impressed if it could trade sideways for years on end.
2021-05-27 20:00:43,stocks,Your cheering did it. 👌
2021-05-28 17:04:08,stocks,"Lol issuing checks does not cause inflation. Printing 3 trillion dollars causes inflation. Shutting down the economy and then there not being enough raw materials like steel, plastic composites, and a quickly changing working base suddenly working from home and needing to buy millions of computers making a chip shortage all causes massive pricing pressure. 

Closing millions of restaurants and losing millions of jobs all adding to the crushing weight of the economy are all going to drive prices up for the commodities and services still in operation. 

I work in manufacturing and supply chains, prices are astronomically high for raw materials."

2021-05-27 20:01:32,stocks,"People are scared of Chinese stocks because they said Chinese government controls the companies. Meanwhile, we have US short sellers and market makers naked short to the point of being short squeezed.
Not too mention trillions of debt in the US.

BABA is undervalued and a good buy"

2021-05-28 08:40:43,stocks,"Sure, just buy with the infinite money we have. :)

This strategy works but you have to identify how much you want to put into BABA and split it over a series of buys using macro trends."
2021-05-28 16:19:44,stocks,"Just stopping by to say I was right, as was the data."
2021-05-28 16:46:06,stocks,I don't see you anywhere near millions of dollars a share. Seems like the stock is dropping now too? Is this the squeeze?
2021-05-28 16:50:03,stocks,"It's not the squeeze. Just FTD resets like I said mixed in with some FOMO buying. Today might be red, but you cant have green days every day. GME started at 180 this week and ended at 222 with a high of nearly 270. 

I never said it was going into the millions. I said Monday and Tuesday would be gain days and new rules are being passed. Both of those things happened."
2021-05-28 17:06:01,stocks,"Okay, i'll concede you predicted a gain this week, obviously I can't deny that the price has gone up. What's the next FTD cycle date then? If you theory is correct, it will presumably jump again?"
2021-05-28 17:16:33,stocks,"I'd be happy to look it up once a get to my desktop later tonight. Yes, it should jump again on the next cycles, but I think the next significant movement will be on or after the shareholders meeting on 6/9.

This weeks rise was all FTDs and FOMO buying. Todays fall was shorting, paperhanding by fomo crowd and stoplosses being hit. There was no official news from GameStop other than the discovery made of their nft.gamestop.com website (lots of speculation on what that will turn into). I think they're saving a lot of big news for the meeting and that's when we'll see some action."
2021-05-28 10:15:34,stocks,"Yeah you need to think much bigger, quite literally. While hydrogen may not make sense for passenger cars, it does for powering shipping and grid storage, where it can benefit from a large amount of space to work with. Today’s problems can and will eventually be solved, at least have some skin in the game for when hydrogen starts really maturing."
2021-05-28 02:40:20,stocks,"Screw Amazon, I hope they lose money and go bankrupt."
2021-05-28 07:04:10,stocks,Glad we agree it exists today and will only become better in the future!
2021-05-28 11:23:53,stocks,"Dude are you some sort of paid marketing guy? We do not agree. 

You seem to believe that the tech will achieve human level competence. I am of the opinion that the current tech will not achieve human level driving and that any improvement will be rather unremarkable.

The point of this discussion was eV valuation. If said tech does come then valuation might make sense but still not guaranteed. Without it however, valuation seems unreasonable."
2021-05-28 16:57:45,stocks,"You have started to agree with me. Initially, you claimed to be a computer scientist and also that self driving tech is impossible. Now you've clearly exposed your ignorance and you agree with me that self driving tech currently exists:


I said: 
> There are self driving cars currently. Current tech provides us with self driving cars.


To which you replied:
> Ok name one that doesnt require a human for safety or that isnt severely handicapped and/or pigeonholed.


At this point, you agreed self driving technology does currently exist.


I don't understand why in you last sentence you correlate ""eV valuation"". Do you mean ""electric vehicles""? Self driving technology might be used by some electric vehicles, but gas cars can benefit too. Tesla does seem overvalues to most people if that's what you're trying to say."
2021-05-28 17:23:34,stocks,This is a stock channel. We are basically talking about Tesla stock.
2021-05-28 15:35:55,stocks,"Focused does not mean used. Hype isn't sustainable. Miracle grow produces crap weed. They grow big but taste like shit. I prefer my food and pot grown in poop not syntheticly supplemented water retaining excuse for Chinese quality vegetables. Miracle grow is only good for petunias, natural soil is less expensive. Any farm surviving today is using their own compost soil, there's not enough money to be made to support something as gross as miracle grow"
2021-05-28 17:20:25,stocks,You’re such an idiot it’s not even funny
2021-05-28 16:51:21,stocks,u/XBV Did you find anything out? The pdf reports that I have seen are recent but I can't even get to the site!
2021-05-27 22:26:33,stocks,Id like to know who downvoted me for saying amc will take off?
2021-05-28 17:18:28,stocks,This comment by Marc_i_N is true. And it is also true that peeps don’t analyze the linguistic nature of their excited comments. Saying this is not financial advice is a simply a disclaimer.    🦍❤️
2021-05-28 07:03:43,stocks,"everything looks good except ev/sales

definitely not a bad pick but some other players like amd are much more interesting to me"
2021-05-28 14:07:39,stocks,SELL IT ALL. NOW. I WAS WRONG. they’re selling out at $8.53 a share and $0.60 divi so $9.13 a share.
