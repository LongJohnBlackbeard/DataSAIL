2021-04-18 18:54:28,stocks,"Main Bear argument that comes to mind is competition, but there will always be competition. I think they‚Äôre a great long term play"
2021-04-18 19:15:19,stocks,"No one is discussing iGaming. Draftkings wants to be an online casino, not just sports betting. There is more than enough room for several companies to operate in the same space - see Las Vegas. It‚Äôs not just one company that makes money. 

Cathie Wood is buying for a reason. 

Long DKNG."
2021-04-18 18:57:32,stocks,"Competition, TAM not being as large as projected, and general lack of stickiness in the product. I don‚Äôt bet on sports but my friend has all of the big betting apps on his phone. No reason for him not to hop from app to app to take advantage of different promotions and unique offerings like ‚Äúmoving the line‚Äù or any combo of ‚Äúrisk-free‚Äù bets or similar. 

A ton of casinos are partnering with online operators to open their own competitors so the space is getting crowded. There‚Äôll be winners and losers and I think kings is the biggest name, but uncertain how the landscape looks going forward."
2021-04-18 18:57:02,stocks,I‚Äôm long draftkings and the only bear case people will say is the valuation. It is extremely rich and pricing in a lot of the growth with where it sits right now. Despite that I still like the play but it‚Äôs been flat for a few weeks because sports have essentially slowed down. I‚Äôm accumulating shares but it was a little concerning when they announced a partnership with the NFL last week and the stock didn‚Äôt move.
2021-04-18 19:37:01,stocks,"Is this question a joke ? What‚Äôs the BEAR case? How about they are trading over 25X forward Revenue and LOSE money every year. The stock is already trading as if it was 5 years in the future. Any pull back in the market, DKNG goes down with it."
2021-04-18 19:27:43,stocks,"Not necessarily a bear case..... but they need to build up other sports. They're heavily weighted toward NFL. 

The daily fantasy business is solid but the gaming revenue will dwarf it once more states are legalized. 

I see them not only being a fantasy and gambling company but also being a gaming media company. They made a recent acquisition of a sports information company, I believe. 

So... not very bearish. I think it levels off a bit bringing its PE to a more reasonable level. But it's a solid near and long term play."
2021-04-18 19:20:54,stocks,"sports betting is the closest thing the USA has to binary options

there is no bear case"
2021-04-18 19:29:46,stocks,I‚Äôve been building my position on DKNG for awhile now and has doubled down after that NFL deal (That Daily Fantasy was a no brainer.  I am gonna triple down once the profitable within reach.  Revenues has been growing and so far that‚Äôs only 12 States that completely legalized online sports betting.  Too much room to grow.  That NFL deal will make them becoming that BRAND at some point

2021-04-18 19:41:50,stocks,"One of my favorite things is that PENN has 11B in debt, where DKNG has 0 debt and 2Billion in cash (this makes it much easier for DKNG to expand quicker and more effective) Penn also has casino betting which works for them in some ways but if you‚Äôre looking for a sports betting play I think DKNG is better they take up 25% of the sports betting market share and are making partnerships left and right. I love them for long term!!"
2021-04-18 19:50:18,stocks,"PENN is going to benefit as economy reopens and people want to revisit casinos. From what I‚Äôve heard, can‚Äôt really top the excitement of gambling in person. Just a counter point to think about."
2021-04-18 19:51:47,stocks,Yes I agree and that‚Äôs one of the reasons why I like PENN in addition to dave portnoy and barstool sports.
2021-04-18 18:56:19,stocks,"Definitely do not do this but the way you make ""money"" from hyperinflation is by taking out a ton of loans before HI hits, use them to buy things that are valuable, then after HI hits use your pocket change to pay off all the loans."

2021-04-18 18:10:53,stocks,I wouldn‚Äôt bet to hard on real estate. Look at 08 real estate values. Like 06 then 09. If you get into it try to after values drop. Yes they will eventually get back up but who knows how bad it could be and how long until it recovers to break even ( asset wise).
2021-04-18 18:25:40,stocks,"Inflation happens when the economy expands, and hyperinflation happens when the economy expands too fast...

I think the term you were looking for was devaluation."

2021-04-18 18:07:19,stocks,Totally forgot about those. Thank you üôè
2021-04-18 18:28:18,stocks,I edited it. Thank you üôè
2021-04-18 18:14:39,stocks,"Unfortunately i dont have any advice for you brother, but in curious as to the answer as well. I didnt mean to be a knob,  hopefully it came across the joke :). Best wishes!"
2021-04-18 18:15:48,stocks,Haha I was being sarcastic. Definitely didn‚Äôt see your comment as confrontational üòÅNot sarcasm this time
2021-04-18 17:57:50,stocks,"Finally, thank the fucking lord. $ICLN has been languishing the last few months. They were way too heavy into $PLUG and I‚Äôm glad they trimmed their position. 

I don‚Äôt think hydrogen fuel cells are the future, or even have a future. They will NEVER replace lithium-ion battery tech. Plug was always a pipe dream. It is far too inconvenient.

Edit: 7% in NZD?? I need an explanation for this ü§îü§î"
2021-04-18 18:00:42,stocks,It's market cap weighted....
2021-04-18 19:07:04,stocks,Is there a full list available? Wondering if my PCG calls will be nuked.
2021-04-18 18:13:13,stocks,"I hope so, if I wanted to invest in plug I would have directly bought stock."
2021-04-18 18:53:50,stocks,Uh oh... Bought two week put on plug at Fridays close. I hope sell-off continue.
2021-04-18 18:50:51,stocks,I think that‚Äôs what they said about nuclear power too. Now it‚Äôs the standard Naval propulsion system.
2021-04-18 18:43:29,stocks,"Also, hydrogen has the problem of being really hard to contain, and extremely flammable.

Every car would basically be a rolling bomb."
2021-04-18 19:07:42,stocks,The standard Naval propulsion system is different forms of oil lol
2021-04-18 18:57:16,stocks,"And yet we don't see cars/busses/airplanes or even spaceships with nuclear engines. Nuclear had its uses, especially for long term/low maintenance engines. What does hydro have?"
2021-04-18 18:46:06,stocks,What do you think they are now?
2021-04-18 19:13:50,stocks,Unless your talking about ships and subs.
2021-04-18 19:12:15,stocks,Exactly.
2021-04-18 19:14:58,stocks,"Yeah, it‚Äôs not practice for everything."
2021-04-18 19:16:08,stocks,Bill Gates wants to build little nuclear sub-stations all over to charge your EV cars.
2021-04-18 19:20:43,stocks,Exactly! Hydrogen doesn't puddle like petrol/gasoline does either. It simply evaporates.
2021-04-18 19:14:21,stocks,"this is my worst case scenario for short term  / intermediate trading.

small caps don't recover, while indices moon. then, indices correct and bring small caps even lower vs Jan/Feb.

imagine having money in nio/pltr/small caps that are down 50+60%, hoping for them to recover soon, only to see them drop further because the broader indices are over-inflated. 

ultimate lose-lose."
2021-04-18 19:16:27,stocks,"I've been buying up growth this week. With earnings season underway, it could be a bit until growth is interesting again. Growth is simply more volatile at infancy stage. But it's where you can potentially see huge gains in a matter of years. If you have conviction in the company you hold, then just keep holding throughout whatever weather. If not, then just move on. 

My big regret was I owned Tesla at 300 back in 2017, and SQ at 25. They had crazy swings until covid, and then dipped back to 2017 levels before finally skyrocketing. I sold somewhere along the coaster in 2019. Wish I would have just held on tight.

Stocks generally trade closer to ATHs than their lows. Just because the market is growing doesn't mean doom and gloom. Market goes up over time. Don't listen to FUD and if you are in mental turmoil, there's no harm in just buying into indexes instead. Growth investing should be set it and forget it, in a way. If I could have just let my SQ and Tesla alone..."
2021-04-18 18:31:27,stocks,"A lot of small caps are down, they‚Äôre either going to enjoy a small spike and then fall off with the upcoming pullback or just fall off with the upcoming pullback. Either hold long or take a loss."
2021-04-18 18:34:29,stocks,"$SOS is just getting shorted to fuck, down 25% last week but I‚Äôm so bullish on them I just keep adding more and waiting for earnings"
2021-04-18 18:03:15,stocks,IWM doesn't look beat up.
2021-04-18 18:16:01,stocks,Are you in small cap growth? SCV is up pretty strongly YTD.
2021-04-18 19:30:12,stocks,You listed some of my bigger holdings.  This is my biggest fear too which is why I made this. Are you in small caps?
2021-04-18 18:47:46,stocks,"How long are you thinking? Like years or months?

Some I‚Äôd want to hold for years but others I was hoping for a few month swing"
2021-04-18 18:57:55,stocks,cause SOS is a bagpile slammer you shit chimp..
2021-04-18 18:04:30,stocks,Maybe it‚Äôs just my small caps :/
2021-04-18 18:33:34,stocks,"IWO (Russell 2000 growth) hasn't necessarily been doing AWFUL but is negative from mid-March, which is likely a better indicator for OP and a lot of this board.

This is the second place that I'll say it, just in a different way, unless (or until) ARKK can get over $130 and confirm it and IWO can gain some footing, I'm very, very bearish on small cap growth right now. I mean, last week was the second week ever, in history, that the Nasdaq had a weekly close over 14k (and the first week with NDX), and apparently you have a number of 2020 favorites and hypergrowth names that are making lower highs... That's not exactly what I'd be looking for. They were damaged even worse than the Nasdaq itself but what I'd be looking for is consolidation."
2021-04-18 18:52:18,stocks,"It‚Äôs impossible to time the market, but with all time highs being hit daily, there will be pull back / consolidation. There‚Äôs variables like catalyst and unexpected news like the Suez Canal incident. Know what you hold, have an exit strategy, and don‚Äôt invest money you‚Äôll need immediately."
2021-04-18 19:03:37,stocks,Did you read anything besides the Hindenburg report or is your smooth brain too dumb to fucking read
2021-04-18 18:46:57,stocks,Yeah those 2020 favorites are really where I am fucked lol
2021-04-18 19:05:27,stocks,"Oh yes, I've read alot on this chinese scam."
2021-04-18 19:18:34,stocks,What makes it a scam
2021-04-18 16:58:13,stocks,All it takes is one issue. Yes Chinese regulation is the reason.
2021-04-18 18:18:35,stocks,"The China premium:  
  
-fear of govt intervention.  
-lack of trust in accurate financial reporting.  
-uncertainty about what you actually own.  
-fear of delisting.  
-fear of volatile US-chinese relations.  
  
The only strange thing Nio and Xiaopeng seem exempt from it."
2021-04-18 17:18:47,stocks,"Financials are pretty opaque. Try reading their SEC statements.

They also have a history of enriching insiders at the detriment to general shareholders. See the ANT financial spinoff. I believe there are other examples."
2021-04-18 17:10:29,stocks,The West is generally scared to own Chinese companies
2021-04-18 17:05:56,stocks,2 things. Chinese stocks trade at lesser valuations that us ones so don‚Äôt expect it to rise to the same as an american counterpart. And the second is the obvious recent issues they had - which for me was a great buying opportunity.
2021-04-18 17:40:47,stocks,Nothing is as it appears in China.
2021-04-18 17:27:16,stocks,The risk is not worth it imo. It's not as if there are no other decent growth companies around to invest in.
2021-04-18 16:58:56,stocks,I think marketing and social knowledge plays a bigger role. Many people around the world have had contact with this company but were unaware or did not care enough to see it as an investment opportunity. There‚Äôs still a lot of investors who go by micro/macro market exposure and Alibaba is still one you have to actively look for in the west.
2021-04-18 18:21:48,stocks,It is the punching bag for the Chinese government.
2021-04-18 18:40:10,stocks,Edit : CCP
2021-04-18 17:03:53,stocks,Jack is Back baby. BABA is running to 350 by EOY.
2021-04-18 17:51:08,stocks,"Remember Alibaba and the 40 thieves?
Only thing Chinese I like is takeout."
2021-04-18 18:31:53,stocks,"They are not, the investors are just deluded and have visions of teslas. And while i liked nio from the start, i do not like how the ads is only 30% of nio china"
2021-04-18 17:26:47,stocks,"Thanks will look into it. I‚Äôve been reading about the ANT issues. Which seem to be getting ironed out. But the enriching insiders part I may have missed. 

But I will look into it. I‚Äôm intrigued by the company but when a company is undervalued like this I‚Äôm a bit weary."
2021-04-18 17:18:54,stocks,So it‚Äôs never going to get a fair valuation but can you expect it grow accordingly? The share price that is. Will the share price grow accordingly with the companies growth. I expect so?
2021-04-18 19:32:41,stocks,Feel like you meant to say CCP lol. PRC is just the official name of the country
2021-04-18 17:59:54,stocks,"Heck yes. Just like any stock you‚Äôll want to compare it to how the market has valued it in the past and not expect it to reach the lofty valuations we currently have for american tech and e-commerce companies. So that said, its very reasonable to expect that baba will continue to appreciate with its growth in rev and earnings. And thats like 5x over the next 5 years! Hence I piled up the baba!"
2021-04-18 19:33:11,stocks,Yup
2021-04-18 17:29:48,stocks,"Lockheed Martin. Very stable stock, also a space play."
2021-04-18 16:40:32,stocks,"WMT is a good ""forever hold"" no matter what"
2021-04-18 18:06:58,stocks,"Costco. People will ALWAYS need food and basic home supplies. Plus it pays a dividend and they just raised there dividend I believe. Also they benefit a lot from the stimulus checks when poor people spend their stimmy check on a 900$ TV. And lastly/most importantly, their concession stand pizza is bomb"
2021-04-18 17:13:54,stocks,Home Depot
2021-04-18 19:13:57,stocks,Would love to hear anyone‚Äôs explanation on selling WMT or JNJ? üòê
2021-04-18 17:03:17,stocks,PG (Procter & Gamble)
2021-04-18 16:44:57,stocks,"sometimes i am using bonds - **TLT (**iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF**), LQD (**iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF**)**"
2021-04-18 17:54:01,stocks,"Value plays would be good. Banks, financials, industrials, defense, utilities, REITS, big pharma, and others."
2021-04-18 17:05:57,stocks,"So is it good to have a percentage of your portfolio in lower return but more stable companies even if under 10% return?  Companies though that seem to hold up better in corrections?

What about NEE?"
2021-04-18 16:50:43,stocks,KMB. No downturn is going to stop the demand for toilet paper.
2021-04-18 19:18:42,stocks,"WMT is the better play because it has so many other businesses it is trying to develop - it wants to be Amazon. 

I don‚Äôt think any of them are fully priced in - so I would go WMT"
2021-04-18 16:45:19,stocks,IBM is great..$6.50 dividend too
2021-04-18 19:12:54,stocks,"MCD, PEP/KO"
2021-04-18 19:37:11,stocks,"I went with 5% WMT and 5% COST last year and still do. They're my bond proxy, defensive consumer staples portion of the portfolio. 

While both have a low beta WMT is absurdly low. I think their W+ membership is also still flying under the radar. 

Costco on the other hand is ready for a membership rate increase and because of what they sell they'll always have a strong moat. Their international presence is also significantly underrated if you ask me. 

So yeah, I'd go WMT between your two choices."
2021-04-18 16:47:46,stocks,"I always wonder why people choose WMT over VTI.  Maybe it's less downside risk than VTI?

I realize it hasn't always beaten the market.

But like I said in March 2020 it only lost 10% during correction while VTI lost over 30%.

I wouldn't put my entire portfolio in WMT of course.  Maybe 5%.

I have a lot of growth names in my portfolio and am looking to put some percentage in defensive stocks

I do have 20% cash right now and don't care for bonds."
2021-04-18 19:50:11,stocks,"They are also known to pay a ‚Äúspecial dividend,‚Äù which is a nice perk."
2021-04-18 17:26:29,stocks,I got 5% in HD!
2021-04-18 17:23:32,stocks,"I second this, I hold both PG and JNJ and I definitely see PG as the better dividend aristocrat to hold onto long term.

JNJ has a massive moat that has to constantly bail them out of bad press. PG just seems to constantly evolve with the world around it.

You can't go wrong with either but PG seems like it has a better growth component to it when compared to JNJ."
2021-04-18 18:23:25,stocks,"PG has been busted for price fixing, animal testing, hazardous working condition, and child labor. Hopefully they‚Äôve made some changes, but I suggest considers that before deciding to hand them a palate of money."
2021-04-18 17:02:52,stocks,5% return last 5 years.  But better than bonds I guess!
2021-04-18 19:19:25,stocks,Thanks.
2021-04-18 16:57:07,stocks,"Yeah but I don't get it.  You get a big dividend but the stock has been depreciating for the last decade?

Does the dividend make up for the depreciation in share price?

I mean if I had put $10k into IBM 5 years ago I'd be losing from my original principle, but gaining dividend?

So basically flat?"
2021-04-18 18:08:05,stocks,Been holding since the 80s
2021-04-18 17:14:14,stocks,One option - buy wmt itm calls. So you get approx. twice whatever wmt returns with the ‚Äòdefensiveness‚Äô that it brings. You forfeit its dividend and pay a small premium but generally 2x the return of wmt will be better than the div and premium paid. Kind of turns a boring but dependable stock into a higher gainer.
2021-04-18 19:31:22,stocks,Animal testing is what prevents me from investing in that industry.
2021-04-18 17:08:12,stocks,With drip it's a little higher. Doesn't hold a candle to a tech growth stock but not likely to ever tank. It's like 8 percent including invested dividends.
2021-04-18 19:20:35,stocks,I own both - but more WMT
2021-04-18 17:19:07,stocks,"It has but it‚Äôs safe. The stock it self doesn‚Äôt move much  and it‚Äôs actually at a pretty decent level now to buy in at, especially with the economy, supposed to take off soon. IBM has been paying a dividend for the last 50 years. If it can post positive revenue this earnings, then it can move up from its current price. It‚Äôs working on stuff that‚Äôs too ahead of it‚Äôs time right now."
2021-04-18 17:28:52,stocks,I don't understand options.  Plus I only have a regular brokerage at Fidelity and an IRA.
2021-04-18 17:09:03,stocks,"Thanks.  What about MSFT though? Do you see it ever tanking and not coming back honestly?

It lost about 25% in March 2020. Yes I realize it didn't do well for many years in the past though."
2021-04-18 18:02:20,stocks,"Well if you do ever want a somewhat safe but leveraged investment, ‚Äòdeep in the money call leaps‚Äô (google that) can provide you with just that. But yes you would need to learn to understand options in order to do it."

2021-04-18 18:12:30,stocks,"Crypto itself is MEANT to exist as a replacement to cash. The thing is, a HUGE majority of people who buy crypto do so with the full intention of selling it down the line for more cash than they bought it for. 

Then you have people saying ‚Äúcrypto is the future of currency‚Äù, and maybe it is. But the reality right now is, most people only see crypto as a way to increase their cash and don‚Äôt see it as a real currency."
2021-04-18 16:37:47,stocks,"I don‚Äôt know. Since they make their money on transaction volume, volatility is a good thing for COIN. It should probably be up tomorrow. Whether or not the market recognizes that, I‚Äôm not sure."
2021-04-18 16:52:42,stocks,There was a flash crash due to margin calls basically. It's very easy to get high leverage on most exchanges so small dips can cause flash crashes. Usually just happens to one coin though. On some smaller exchanges stuff will totally dump (like maybe 50% or more) for a few minutes and then come back fast. In this case it was a really hig exchange that started it (binance I'm hearing) which caused it to ripple out to other exchanges.
2021-04-18 17:13:30,stocks,"You act like you know Coin will dip because of this but you dont.
More trading is good for them"
2021-04-18 16:37:25,stocks,people need to understand that Coinbase makes money also when crypto tanks. people are still trading. maybe even more so than normally (panic selling etc)
2021-04-18 18:07:25,stocks,"With the 12% drop, I finally entered crypto (Ethereum). Not much ($1,000) but it's a start (0.75% of portfolio). I'll throw another $1,000 in when/if Ethereum gets to $3k."

2021-04-18 17:19:33,stocks,"This is true, I‚Äôm speculating here about what is going to happen tomorrow. A lot of investing involves predictions, which is what‚Äôs happening here.

That said, in the days leading up to COINs direct listing, many analysts criticized the fact that the price of COINs shares would be too closely tied to the price of Bitcoin and that as a result the company‚Äôs stock price would fluctuate tremendously. This is just building off of that, which does not seem like a stretch to me"
2021-04-18 16:50:20,stocks,The risk is if crypto tanks and stays down.
2021-04-18 16:39:02,stocks,"He didn‚Äôt dump his shares. The company did a direct listing, which means no new shares were created to sell to the public. This is how a direct listing works, people have to sell a lot of stock for the direct listing to take place"
2021-04-18 16:47:18,stocks,Then don‚Äôt reply to the post lmao
2021-04-18 18:13:29,stocks,Your both right
2021-04-18 18:31:14,stocks,"Things are not that straightforward.
There are ranges in which cryptos can fluctuate without hurting Coinbases business and stock market forces that can counteract a correlation with crypto.

I would expect that the correlation becomes more apparent the bigger the move is. Analysts are upgrading it left and right already and they could easily say this dip brings in buyers into crypto soon."
2021-04-18 16:53:19,stocks,"Oh, well then like the other person posted,  when BC goes back up it will go up."
2021-04-18 18:35:51,stocks,"Maybe. I can only speculate about the future.

If tomorrow the share price for COIN is minimally changed, then I probably won‚Äôt buy more."

2021-04-18 16:00:34,stocks,Tesla has a market cap of 710 Billion so yeah if you are coming up with a value of 83B it is going to seem off. Your share count is about right.
2021-04-18 16:08:00,stocks,"nope that really is the current shares outstanding, if you do the current price x 960m shares you get the current market cap of Tesla ~ 700bn, however when i used a 50% free cash flow growth i got a price of $89 for 5 years time, and using seeking alphas 67.5% growth estimate i get a price of $139.62, shows you how truly overvalued tesla is atm"

2021-04-18 15:57:19,stocks,"Some say your portfolio should have 3% to 5% cash because cash should be treated as an asset class.

However, it's better to just have 3 months to 24 months worth of monthly expenses in a savings account.  **Why?**  Because 3 months is the minimum avg turn around of finding a new job.  You can literally get fired and live off your 3 months savings without changing your lifestyle while finding a new job.  I can tell you I've done this several times in my life, so it works.

But why save more than 3 months.. up to 24 months?  That depends on how many dependents you have, or how many things you need to take care of, say you have a car or house, and your car/house needs unexpected repairs.. you don't want to be forced to sell stock to pay for those things especially if you're in a bear market or already at a loss."

Use % to see if investing for you. A 100 dollar gain may not be alot, but it 10% gain, which is great. 

Only reason I think that is the way to go, is for me once I started investing, I started to read about the market and notice any news related to markets.

Good thing is market is not going straight up now, so any gain you make may actually be earned. If you started last year, probably would have thought you best investor as it was hard to loose money."

I'm not invested in CDPR but I wouldn't count them out and if you're gonna sell now you didn't really learn a lot.

Momentum is surely gone on this one now, and the valuation is still high considering past performance (I'm referring to CDPR's past financial performance here, not past games' successes).

Can't think of any catalysts in the next 2-3 years which would bring the stock price back up. They'll be pouring resources into Cyberpunk just to make it playable (all of which will be free to players); future multiplayer cash-cow is all but cancelled; GoG loses them money; and to top it off there won't be another Witcher game for many years."

Once they patch it up, you can bet those players will be buying the game. NMS  sold a ton of units even with the bad rep. and they still continue to sell tons of units after they patched it up. 

CDP seems like the perfectionist kind of company that wont stop improving it until it  gets the recognition it wanted. I can easily see them pulling a NMS on this game and it gets a second life and revenue boost.

They only pushed the game out  unfinished because of deadlines and gamers whining. I doubt they will be doing that again in the future."
2021-04-18 13:43:31,stocks,"I'm not forgetting that - but how many will be buying it at steep discounts instead of the launch price? Their financials clearly show a trend of declining revenues in the years following a massive release.

No Man's Sky was released 5 years ago, that's a lot of time to spend bringing a game up to standard - and they were able to do so with substantially fewer employees and cost than CDPR.

&#x200B;

>They only pushed the game out  unfinished because of deadlines and  gamers whining. I doubt they will be doing that again in the future. 

They pushed it out because of greed, hoping to meet quarterly targets whilst expecting gamers to throw money at an unfinished piece of crap (which let's be honest, they usually do). All of the deadlines were set (and constantly missed) by CDPR, not gamers.

A decade of goodwill which vanished in a week."

Meetings were boasting advisors and support staff about how wonderful everybody was, and how well the firm was doing. Bonuses for everybody!   All I can say it was definitely a learning experience to almost immediately have to start dealing with the fallout the next year.  Attitudes were not those of the happy successful coworkers just from months ago.  Advisors were committing suicide. Clients were demanding we sell everything.  Almost all firms were having to defend themselves not just legally,  but constantly to clients, and you were always waiting to see what was going to come out about your firm and what kind of settlement was going to be paid. Not to forget the even more rules and regulations that came after.  Going through it so early in my career really molded me and how to handle crisis within the business.  Basically taught me to be a therapist too lol"

2021-04-18 14:41:13,stocks,"I‚Äôd been doing well financially and had been investing slowly while holding onto cash for probably 2 years prior because I didn‚Äôt feel they could keep building the way they were.  In Fort Collins we had a Best Buy, Circuit City and Ultimate Electronics a stones throw (literally) apart, and Bed Bath and Beyond right next to a Linens and Things. Also had a Barnes and Noble next to a Borders bookstore. All of those were in the same parking lot.

Gas was hitting over $4.80 a gallon when it popped. Everything went on sale, jobs were just gone, stores closed, gas prices dropped, and the markets were obliterated.

I started buying in companies I believed would weather the crisis. I bought BBY, WMT, CAT@33, MSFT, etc.  Made enough to fucking retire, but I was only 42. I‚Äôm retired military too, so don‚Äôt think I didn‚Äôt think about it.  13 years later and I still set up 60-day limit sells across my portfolios and adjust them weekly, and pay off all credit cards monthly.  It still feels like yesterday.

I had around 30k on credit cards at the time and the banks doubled their interest rates. My new house dropped below what I owed, and I swore if I survived it, I would never get in that position again. I made it, but lost a lot of neighbors who couldn‚Äôt pay their mortgages, credit cards, auto loans, etc.  I‚Äôm ready for the next one should it happen.  Oh yeah, and I got divorced just before it popped and was paying off that shit too.

I had just started working and investing at the end of 2005 and was invested in mainly individual stocks.  

I was lucky because I didn‚Äôt lose my job or take a paycut, but I was greedy and kept trying to ‚Äúbeat the market‚Äù and so didn‚Äôt want to put money into index funds...plus people on tv were like ‚Äúit‚Äôs the end of capitalism, hide your money‚Äù

Biggest lessons I learned: 
1) index funds are a better choice for me
2) stick to your investment plan - keep dca‚Äôing
3) don‚Äôt watch CNBC or tv in general for financial advice 
4)the long term trend is up and to the right. 
5) don‚Äôt sell covered call leaps.  That was probably the dumbest thing I ever did on my $3 bac shares

Your everyday advisor and staff was too busy dealing with the fallout in the market in general and trying to keep clients from making mistakes in a tanking market and keep them from walking off the ledge. My specific experience was just that.  The big boys in home office making big moves are the ones who probably had a more like experience of the movie with those advisors who heavily invested in those securities. Advisors really did commit suicide from it.  Losing their wealth and their clients.  Insanity.

Edit: I should mention too, we did not let our clients liquidate their accounts.  We stood strong and weathered the storm.  It has been a tremendous learning experience for clients that you don't just sell all when shit hits the fan."

2021-04-18 00:00:00,stocks,"Invest in what you know vs correlation with your income I've heard that you should only invest in what you know. That implies investing in the industry that you work in.

However, if a significant portion of my investments are tied to LMT and they take a turn for the worse, now both my income and investments will suffer.

In my opinion, it seems foolish to invest a large portion of your portfolio directly in the industry in which you receive income. Just like how it would be foolish for all your investments to be in the same industry.

They also have a smart way of bouncing people around the store without it feeling like a burden.

So I invest in Costco, because I know the store and will be able to spot a drop in quality because I frequent the stores. In my interpretation, it's not about what industry you're in, but what you find yourself going back to in your hobbies and free time.

2021-04-18 12:25:48,stocks,"I'm from a maths background, so I mostly look use statistical tools to make trading decisions, so someone else would be in a better position to give you this advice. But I can give you my two cents on how I would approach using industry knowledge.

It's not so much that you should invest in things you're an expert at. You should invest in things that will yield you returns, which can be from any industry, but you just need to understand that financial markets are indicative of the underlying economy.

A weak economy would not bode well for most industries, so whether you have an expertise in an area or not will not likely help you much in any case of a downturn, which serves to show the importance of having a source of income that's independent of your salary and ideally independent of the underlying state of the economy that you are exposed to. That's the academic view.

Most people disregard all of these seemingly easy rationalisations and invest in what excites them, which isn't a bad thing. Without the initial and niche excitement attached we wouldn't have most technologies we take for granted nowadays simply by virtue of the firms not being able to continue producing those later products without people buying the first-pass products. Actual investing is about believing in the possibility of the latter scenario for an industry or firm.

If you have first-hand knowledge about the future of a methodology/paper/piece of research/technology due to industry exposure, you would immediately spot the potential in small and cheap firms. There was an article about a lecturer who became a billionaire by investing in Moderna early. Granted, no one could've predicted Covid, but probability is what you're playing when you're investing anyway, if you want to leverage that first hand knowledge might as well have a shot at the moon if you know where it's likely to end up a month from now. All the big boys in an industry are probably being covered by 20 different analysts at MS, GS, Jefferies etc."
2021-04-18 12:50:20,stocks,"Here‚Äôs a great example. The market was bearish on a video game stock. Nobody trading stocks could possibly be more familiar with the video game industry than I was at the time. I knew because I was plugged into the gaming industry at the time those analysts were wrong. I bought the stock, got a 30% return and cashed out.

I had a better eye on that company than ratings agencies. Eventually they would catch up, but mot before I bought it at an undervalued price. 

Make sense? You‚Äôre looking for the market to believe one thing, and your unique knowledge may be able to help you figure out if there is a gap between market pricing and your unique insight."

2021-04-18 00:00:00,stocks,"Index Fund VS Mutual Funds VS ETF/Indi Stocks I have a perception that index funds are just a variation of ETF indexes, but how does index funds require a lower expense ratio than buying ETF's via my online broker? I just cant seem to understand the concept of that. Doesnt both require buying and selling? 

Is mutual fund same as robo investing whereby you give the money to a bank/agency and they help you to invest?"
2021-04-18 11:46:17,stocks,"A mutual fund has a mandate to invest to a specific strategy. An active fund tries to beat it‚Äôs specified benchmark, a passive fund may try to replicate the performance of it‚Äôs benchmark or generate absolute returns.

An ETF has a lower expense because they don‚Äôt perform any active analysis to find potential investments. You, the ETF and everyone knows the composition of the S&P500, so they can run the fund on lower expenses. On the other hand, active funds (both ETFs and mutual funds) charge a higher fee since they spend more resources on analysing companies. Similar to mutual funds, ETFs have a specific mandate, but they tend to be passive i.e. try to replicate an index/benchmark.

ETFs are traded on an exchange (it‚Äôs in the name), while mutual funds are not. When you buy into a mutual fund, you buy units at the closing NAV (which you don‚Äôt know at the time of the order); on the other hand there is a market price for ETFs at which you can trade."

be diversified, dont put all your money into Tech stocks cause when a correction comes your portfolio will hurt, alot of people were panicking when this happened like last month. Have Financials, Energy, Utilities, Tech, Industrials etc. 

take reddit opinions with a grain of salt

Dont pay for any services like Motley fool etc, no matter how good it sounds its all bullshit.

Learn how to analyze financial statements, read the investors page on the companies website in which you are trying to invest in. Also if you really want to get serious learn things like DCF in order to valuate companies better.

&#x200B;

$DUST - What a beautiful drop right to where we want. Under $17 is still possible so do not catch falling knives, but this trend and support usually hold true.

&#x200B;

$DVN  - Called last week to success, one more time for good measure. CLEAR support and CLEAR trend intersecting, my favorite. This could be a great play tomorrow / this week. 

&#x200B;

$HEAR - What a gorgeous triangle, I love the obvious risk v reward created. If we do get a break out up, this one could be WILD.

&#x200B;

$JDST - Obviously do your own DD, but this is a great value. It sometimes break below so to get the full move will be impossible, but this is a FANTASTIC deal.

&#x200B;

$LQDT - An amazing triangle is forming, higher lows and lower highs, so we have breakout potential. I think we have a little more to dip, but this could be a great low risk play.

&#x200B;

$NXE  - Great trend up here; we again have a bit more to dip. But this is a weak support area, I think by Wednesday this could be PRIMED for a big move (20% potential).

&#x200B;

$PSNL - Anyone who followed me - $PSNL was my baby. It died lol. This is a clear value, and we are waiting on a higher high, but if you like value - this one is it.

&#x200B;

$UUUU - Another one where we need a day or two - that is kind of the tune for the day it seems. Clear support here, but I want a better deal. Around $5, $UUUU becomes very enticing."

A total of 272427 shares were sold, spread over April 14 and 16. Why did Cathie Woods sell Tesla shares? To publish a crazy price target 3 weeks ago and then sell shares makes little sense to me.

2021-04-18 10:03:10,stocks,Tesla is ten percent of ark etf .  Tesla goes up in value and now is 11-12 percent .  Cathy wants it to stay at 10 percent so she sells enough to bring it back down to ten percent and uses that profit to buy coin base .  This is called rebalancing and the percentages are set before hand so as to remain unemotional in trading.  All etfs do this just ark does it a lot more than usual. Tesla remains their biggest investment.  It does not mean that there is anything wrong with Tesla this week.
2021-04-18 12:22:43,stocks,"As TSLA goes up, Cathie sells TSLA to rebalance. Always been this way."

2021-04-18 13:45:39,stocks,She sold SPLK a couple of days before they announced that their CTO resigned which caused the stock to drop 10%. I wouldn't be surprised if she knows something is up with TSLA.

And every single time there are doom and gloom posts about how Cathie is selling Tesla. Every single time. And then she rebuys Tesla on a dip when it drops to under 10% of the fund.

Cathie's bullish position on Tesla has not changed. If the day ever comes when Tesla is no longer their biggest holding then this might finally be a news story worth discussing, but until then, any selling of Tesla to rebalance the fund means absolutely nothing."

Tesla and other positions based on conviction are set a +\- % of fund allocation.  

If Tesla rises in price that % naturally grows heavier and must be trimmed. If it drops, the opposite occurs and more is purchased.

2021-04-18 11:50:31,stocks,If she wants to keep it a certain percentage why didnt she sell it when it was around $800.00-$890.00? Is it because she just needed the funds to buy Coinbase?

2021-04-18 15:00:36,stocks,Ark has removed the 10% maximum rule though.

It took them four months to verify my information and let me use the service, to which I logically decided I did not want to put my actual money into a business like that - what if I want to take some money out of my Coinbase account and put it back into my bank? I could be waiting weeks or months with no response.

That seems par for the course with everyone using Coinbase. I'd strongly recommend anyone wanting to invest in Coinbase to take the time to create an account and try using the service for a while, comparing it to other available exchanges. For them to have such terrible service while charging such extortionate fees is an awful sign, and I'd never send my money their way, either through their platform or their stock."

Correct me if I am wrong, but isn‚Äôt Coinbase just another Robinhood except for crypto? If that‚Äôs the case, I don‚Äôt see them making a ton of money off commissions in the near future.

I guess some people see coinbase branching out into other things in this new decentralized economy, I personally don't belive in decentralized economics because as nice as it is in the good times, in bad times there is no one to help you. Also insiders dumping their shares dosnt inspire confidence in me that they have big plans for the future, also fun fact the insiders have made more money dumping than coinbase has in the last 5 years."

2021-04-18 11:25:09,stocks,">isn‚Äôt Coinbase just another Robinhood except for crypto?

Coinbase is crypto AWS, crypto Robinhood and crypto NYSE in one company. They'll also likely be the institutionally trusted gateway to everything going on in defi. Technology, reputation, deep liquidity, compliance, security and expertise under one roof. Your e-Schwab isn't going to walk in and reproduce that. 

By the time legacy brokerages are trading a few cryptos Coinbase could be wrapping defi protocols seamlessly into their UI, half of which their venture arm vetted and seeded, with the best insurance offerings because of their understanding and history, and probably doing the back end custody and liquidity for those banks, etc. Their institutional support people will be 100x more knowledgeable, and have access to 100x deeper liquidity. 

It's like how people thought Amazon was just a bookstore instead of the center of a new tech commerce sector. Coinbase is the center of a new exponential tech finance sector."

While a Coinbase representative declined to comment due to the company being in a so-called ""quiet period,"" based on filings made before the listing, **it would indicate Armstrong sold about 1.5% of his stake..**

A lot of them are shady or not even in the US market.  CB is synonymous with crypto buying for a large part of the US.  That will not change anytime soon.

None of their holdings can exceed 10% of their portfolio, so when TSLA ran up last week, they had to sell some to keep it below 10%.

Sorry, but I don't see why Coinbase wouldn't be a good starting investment if you are interested in cryptocurrency. The only con you bring up is that they are not a bank. But many reputable brokerages are not banks. The fact is that they have brand recognition and their profits have more than doubled over the past year.

Well, look at the 4-5 years following the 2009 bubble. By 2015 we had unemployment levels not seen since the 70‚Äôs. Mom and pop businesses were closing all over the place. All you had to do was drive down Main St of any town in America and you could see things weren‚Äôt good. Yet at the same time the stock market was booming. Why?  Because the government put the printing presses into warp speed and all that money went straight into the financial markets. In reality the money hasn‚Äôt stopped printing since 2009. 

Back in 2012 I was asking the same question you are. I was super worried about hyper inflation and the stock market being over heated. But what time has taught me 2 things:  as long as the government is printing money and doing nonstop QE the market will rise no matter what ‚Äúthe real world‚Äù is doing.  Second, hyperinflation is happening, just not in the CPI, it‚Äôs happening in the stock market.

Right now with valuations so high it doesn't necessarily mean a crash is more likely, but it does mean that any crash may be bigger.  So while it would be fantastic to have money available to buy a big dip, since you don't know when it's coming you could hold cash/bonds, buy low on the next big dip, and *still* end up behind because the prices went up more while you were holding than the eventual crash and where you buy back in (since it is hard to time the bottom of the crash)."

Our sales this month have been the worst I‚Äôve seen in years and our vendors are beginning to see major backorders due to being unable to produce their goods. I‚Äôm talking the types of products that shouldn‚Äôt be stocking out, not just some of the slow moving items produced in lesser quantity. The pandemic last year was bad enough for many reasons in terms of logistical challenges but there‚Äôs something else going on right now which I fear may be worse than what we saw last year.

2021-04-18 13:38:17,stocks,"Fear and greed (or desire) are the two most basic human emotions. It seems that the world‚Äôs two biggest economies (USA and China), don‚Äôt know about the others, are really growing at the moment. At the same time, investments apart from equities are not doing well. Holding cash is dangerous. So everyone is putting their money in equities. Maybe this is what‚Äôs fueling the surge. There was a lot of this same talk in autumn 2019. If you listened to that talk, it would have been a big mistake. Anyway if you have solid companies, even if there‚Äôs a correction, they will rebound. Buy quality and hold!"

is over and business starts booming again.

2021-04-18 14:47:33,stocks,There have been people sitting on the sidelines their whole lives due to the market always hitting ‚Äúrecord highs.‚Äù The thing about timing the market is you have to do it twice - once when you get out and again when you decide to get back in. Don‚Äôt let fear get the best of you. Dollar cost averaging and holding will be your friend through any volatility over the long term.
2021-04-18 15:02:40,stocks,"As much as people around here say they don‚Äôt like to time the market... they sure do like to try time the market lol. I remember March of 2020 when the fear was the most extreme that has probably ever been exhibited on Reddit. People were selling all their stocks, buying puts, making predictions of the Dow dropping in half... people lost a lot of money with that. Now that the market has raged higher for the past 13 months people suddenly say don‚Äôt try to time the market. 

I like to use Reddit as somewhat of a fear/greed index. When you start seeing more and more comments about leaving your money in and not trying to time the market, that to me is a sign of extreme greed. Not that these comments are at all bad advice. It‚Äôs generally very good advice. But these types of comments seem to rise to the top the most when there is the most greed in the market. I‚Äôve started raising more cash by selling off my most speculative positions because I do think a downturn is likely, even if only minor or temporary. And when that happens these high flyers are going to crash the hardest."

2021-04-18 15:55:59,stocks,"Newbie investor so take it with a grain of salt, but I'm uncertain of 2021 as well. 

If you're investing for the long out future with indexes don't try to time the market. The infamous dotcom bubble ended in 3 years. If you had been only in SPX and consistently dollar-cost averaging through that you would be well into the green by the time the housing bubble happened. If you dollar-cost averaged through that too you'd be far into the green by now. 

Another crash is always incoming. Nobody knows when. Sit on a bit of cash or cut a little back on your monthly deposits if you want and plan on buying after but don't take your money out. People do this after every dip and always end up blowing a hole in their own foot by ruining retirement accounts."

2021-04-18 11:24:08,stocks,"I don't think you should be worried about the evaluation of stocks. I mean in essence what does a stock boil down to? It is an asset, a piece of a company. You're not putting money into money, you're putting money into a company which has human capital, manufacturing facilities, inventory, goods to be sold. In the long run it's really hard to lose on the stock market as long as you hold in the companies that are going to stick around. I wouldn't listen to the guys that are touting some random companies no one has heard of. Those are speculations. Now there's nothing wrong with putting SOME money into speculations but it should never be a long term large piece of the pie investment strategy. If you invest in the name brand companies that are going to be around for years because they fill an absolute need in society then you'll likely be fine even if once in a while things take a downturn. Ultimately the U.S. economy is designed in such a way that the individuals running these companies, they want to keep their profits and keep making money and growing and it will continue to happen."

I‚Äôve lost out on lots of gains being overly fearful. I‚Äôd advise against it. But other advice - nobody knows anything lol. If you‚Äôre convinced, sell now and just have a strategy of when to re-enter."

The first 2 discuss a temporary drop in spring of 2020, which makes sense seeing how they were published in the summer, once the data from the spring was analyzed. The third article you posted, which is much more recent, shows the same thing my link does, that household debt is high and keeps going higher, notwithstanding the downward spike in the spring of last year."

2021-04-18 12:20:43,stocks,"There was an interest rate spike in the 10 yr Treasury about a month or so ago that showed the Fed isn't in complete control of interest rates. A lot of growth/speculative stocks that aren't profitable tanked HARD, especially green energy stocks that were pumped up really high, like in hydrogen and solar. 

The rotation now is into solid value stocks. That can include big tech, but I think index ETFs is a pretty smart way to go, as there's plenty of other value stocks in there that have room to gain. There'll definitely be some pullbacks whenever interest rates spike again, but the last spike appears to have calmed down and the Fed has said they probably won't raise rates until at least next year, unless inflation really picks up. 

Will there be another crash? I'm not so sure. Last March, the catalyst was the pandemic. Right now, we just had another massive stimulus bill, and now we're looking at a massive infrastructure bill that I believe the Dems can pass through reconciliation if they have to. So the US gov't is putting A LOT of money into the economy, plus the Fed is more than likely going to try and keep rates low for the foreseeable future. I think solid value stocks are going to keep growing for the time being. They'll probably do well even through any pullbacks, but it might be a more sideways market when and if the Fed starts raising. If I were you, I'd keep indexing, hold some solid high dividend stocks (T, VZ, MO, DOW, Utilities), and keep some cash on hand to pick up any speculative stocks you like on any pullbacks."

2021-04-18 12:43:52,stocks,"With such massive stimulus, and more to come in the likely event that some form of large infrastructure spending comes (especially including the multiplier that comes with infrastructure spending), I don't know that we're on the cusp of a downturn. But I do think that stocks that are overvalued will eventually be brought back to earth, so it's just a matter of whether that will have ripple effects directly by people losing money or indirectly by funds that are tied up in those stocks (like $ARKK, maybe) or investors panic selling as a result. Then again, it seems like those stocks are largely held by new retail investors that embrace the not entirely wrong (I suppose) assumption that if they don't sell the price won't go down.

So I don't really know. We're in what feels like uncharted territory on a number of fronts so it's difficult to tell what comes next. But given that the market doesn't seem to reflect reality I would anticipate some sort of shift. I would bet that value stocks are still safe though. And once other stocks shit the bed we could see round two of the shift to value assets, maybe.

On top of all that, I think people have forgotten about the strong political appetite for some trust-busting, which would have a negative impact as well."
2021-04-18 12:49:44,stocks,That's why this game is called investing. By stoncks from undervalued companies with; and this is important; dividends. It's like getting interest on your stocks.

One caveat, the big reason why they went up when they did is because the yield rate went down sharply at the same time (yields and bond prices have an inverse relationship). Yields are still lower than they were in 2019, so there's not as much room to go down, but they've crept up a lot from mid-2020."

But if you are a truly long-term investor, short-term corrections and volatility aren't even worth looking at. If SPY is 417 today and you think it's going to 2000 when you cash it out for your retirement, does it really matter if it dips to 380 next week but surge to 450 by EOY?"

2021-04-18 12:27:26,stocks,"History has shown us timing the market does not work for 99% of people and for those who it does work for a decent amount can be attributed to luck. This is why trades like Bill Ackmans in March 2020 are praised so highly. They are near impossible to execute. You can try but you will most likely fail. Don't let your fear of the market crashing stop you from buying great businesses at good prices. Even if you are correct in your prediction of the market you will not lose much if you have the right temperament and continue to buy in to the market whenever you see an opportunity. I recommend keeping enough cash on hand that makes you comfortable whether that is 10% or 30% any is fine as long as you can cover your liabilities without you selling your stocks. The rest should be invested or on the sidelines until you find a great business at a price you find reasonable.

In the words of Warren Buffett himself:

‚ÄúI never have an opinion about the market because it wouldn‚Äôt be any good and it might interfere with the opinions we have that are good,‚Äù  ‚ÄúIf we‚Äôre right about a business - if we think a business is attractive - it would be very foolish for us to not take action on that because we thought something about what the market was going to do. ‚Ä¶ If you‚Äôre right about the businesses, you‚Äôll end up doing fine.‚Äù"

Even though the market didn‚Äôt crash, a lot of people were genuinely worried that it would and readjusted their holdings accordingly. During times of excess profits it‚Äôs easy to get carried away and not realize that we‚Äôre over extending ourselves. At every point, investors need to be asking themselves ‚Äúif the market tanks right now, am I okay with the position I‚Äôm in?‚Äù and if the answer is ‚Äúno‚Äù, then you‚Äôre over extended compared to your personal risk tolerance, and being in that position make it exponentially more likely that you‚Äôre going to fold and sell low when the chips are down. 

I think that a lot of people right now, and especially new investors who have never know anything except 30%+ annual gains (so far) are over extended, and are going to get hurt badly the next time there is a major market draw down if they don‚Äôt readjust their position. Trying to time the market is useless, but thinking through what would happen if it crashes in the near future and where that would leave you is an important mental exercise that I wish more people did."

He does time the market in that if there isn't a single company that is under or adequately valued, he won't have any money in the market.

In response to OP's question, though, Buffet is selling banks but buying other stuff. You don't have to leave the market if you can find undervalued companies."

Yet more people are invested than ever before and there is massive speculation in every asset class. 

And regarding the pandemic, what happens when people get back to their real lifes? The stock-market hype WILL pass as it always did when there ever was alot of euphoria and new investors. They will be the first to leave when they realize you can‚Äòt keep up the 20%-gains for too long and they want to spend their money on parties, new cars, vacations, new homes.

After what I saw with IWO (Russell 2000 growth) yesterday, combined with what I've been observing with ARKK, I'm very bearish on innovative tech right now unless ARKK can get over $130 and confirm it. Maybe they gain their footing if the major averages take a break, but since the major story of the tech wreckage this time was an absolute beatdown in innovative tech (while profitable tech stocks got hit but many not as hard hit as the time the Nasdaq dropped 10 percent in 3 trading days early last fall), I don't know..."

There have been many, many studies on this, and over and over again the outcome and best advice is to just sit tight and keep putting money in to your index funds on a regular basis (assuming that‚Äôs your strategy), whether there‚Äôs a downturn or not.

If you feel you absolutely must prepare for a downturn, buy some consumer defensive stocks that would maintain most of their value through a crash, but still generate profits for you in the meantime. Then you can sell those after a crash and invest in some downtrodden industries."

But summer came, they didn't buy saying the worst is yet to come. A few of them finally admitted defeat and got back in in winter... only to see the pull back in January.

The fear mongering on here is ridiculous sometimes where everyone thinks a correction, a crash, or even a depression are right around the corner. And although some trade on the short-term here, most timelines are going to be on the order of years. Trying to get cute will cost you in the long run."
2021-04-18 12:43:49,stocks,It is a difference building up cash during phases where everyother stock seems overvalued. You don't have to be invested 100% on all times. You don't need to sell your assets but just don't invest new money if you can't find a bargain

2021-04-18 14:25:53,stocks,"Of course it is, if you believe in reversion to the mean. On long enough time frames the price of securities converges to intrinsic value, so buying a security when undervalued times the market in that security implicitly.

It's surprising to me that so many people don't understand this simple argument, even though they trumpet both their belief in reversion to the mean and their belief in value investing.

Similarly, buying a market index when the whole market is undervalued (say by measures such as the Shiller P/E) times the entire market implicitly."

goes for a bit on the side; keep a bit back to get a bonus if things go on sale, but don't miss out on months or years of slow, steady, boring gains while waiting for the perfect moment to go balls deep and make a killing  because most people are bad at that"

I do this on the SPY. It ends up being more economical since I'm usually right (eventually), meaning I may have to repeat the operation a few times in a row in order to get a payoff that more than compensates for any loss of value on the portfolio as a whole.

But you won't find me making outright bets against the market, so ""short"" ETFs are useless to me. And I especially never bet against tech, not since 2001."

MSFT is constantly investing in very nice stuff, and they‚Äôre doing a lot of AI. I‚Äôm not a fan of them but this holds potential for the future. Also they‚Äôve been around for eons and won‚Äôt be gone anytime soon, if ever. I think it‚Äôs a solid investment and will grow. 

GOOGL is so deeply rooted into our society that I hardly think it will ever stop growing as a company. They own the most useful tool on earth, which virtually everyone uses. I like the way it‚Äôs run, their commitment to their work, and I pay them for services that I need for my business - not to count that the entire YouTube industry (of which I‚Äôm not a fan but it‚Äôs going up) is powered by them; and these guys make some serious money. Also almost everyone watches YouTube or uses Google or Gmail. So I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre overvalued either.

AAPL, I used to be a fan, but after Jobs was gone they started pulling off studf that really isn‚Äôt on. Phones that get bigger and bigger and more expensive and useless every year. Audio jacks removed just to sell badly-designed earphones. Chargers/replacements of all sorts cost an abomination. Their Apple geniuses and warranties usually suck big time, and take ages to work out anyway. The new MacBook pros only come with usb-c ports, meaning you need all sorts of adapters. Previously they had 2 ports on each side, now it‚Äôs only two on ONE side, meaning you‚Äôll be extremely uncomfortable. They slow down old devices on purpose. Ah yes, and they‚Äôve removed the function keys on the MacBooks Pros to replace them with a crappy touchbar no one cares about. I use their products for work **heavily** but won‚Äôt invest since **I deeply dislike the direction they‚Äôre taking.** 

For AMAZON and FB I‚Äôll just say that I find them to be extremely unethical businesses ran by people I‚Äôm not a fan of. I won‚Äôt invest in these either regardless of them being overvalued or not.

TESLA is in an extreme bubble. They might go up for the near future but their revenue sucks, they treat their employees horribly and Elon Musk is an absolute lunatic who misses every single deadline and proposes products that are not fit for life (cybertruck). They will surely be around for a long time but I attribute their current success to a lack of serious competition as of now. But competition will come and I can definitely see Tesla going down in favour of other EV brands. This would be both due to the need of diversification AND the fact that new EV manufacturers on the market would probably make it look very obvious that Tesla is absolutely all speculation. 

But also I am extremely stupid and this is not financial advice.

2021-04-18 12:41:31,stocks,Agreed. Stocks are one of the few things people are afraid to buy when they are on sale. So there probably wont be an end to the fear mongering. Every pull back/correction is going to get called the beginning of the next crash for this crowd until they get it right. Which who knows when that will be could be next week or not until next year.

I am back in shopify at this time, it was always a high conviction long-term play for me, but well... yeah. I though I could outsmart the market.. I did not and lost on life changing gains lol.

2021-04-18 14:25:52,stocks,"Not to mention it's not like downturns all happen in one day. Last year's March drawdown was over a month. Same with 2008 (2008 was actually the result of a larger drawdown destroying margin, so it happened over two or three months). If you're a bear watching for the market to crash, it's not like it doesn't give some *very* strong signals to get out during its downturn

Even last year, anyone paying attention could have seen in January that supply chain issues were going to turn into a market bloodbath once inventory was all used up. It wound up being a lot bigger than I think anyone was expecting, but there were still some real strong signs to tread carefully"

2021-04-18 14:23:23,stocks,It is implicitly equivalent to timing the market due to [reversion to the mean](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/meanreversion.asp).
2021-04-18 15:00:38,stocks,"No, selling a company you no longer believe to be fairly valued by the market at a given time is, by definition, timing the market. Buffet absolutely does this, just with a few key differences: Buffett buys in far larger quantities than the average redditor, he does far more research before buying which helps him maintain confidence in his investments even during a market downturn, and, because of this confidence, he usually only sells due to exceptionally rare or unforeseen circumstances (e.g. the Wells Fargo account scandal). The very idea of value investing (Warren‚Äôs whole investing philosophy), relies on timing your entry points before the market has spent the time to correctly value a company. In fact, Warren Buffett has said himself that he loves crashes because he gets to buy companies for cheap. I don‚Äôt know where this idea came from that he doesn‚Äôt time the market at all. He simply doesn‚Äôt enter investments that he doesn‚Äôt believe in wholeheartedly in the first place."
2021-04-18 13:49:14,stocks,"I feel like we're muddying the waters. Selling your share of a company or buying based on when you think it has gotten over or undervalued is absolutely timing the market, but on a more microscopic scale."
2021-04-18 12:04:45,stocks,it's*
2021-04-18 14:37:50,stocks,"The same argument works for a market index, which reflects security prices in aggregate. Buying an index when the market is undervalued by various indicators (Shiller P/E, Buffet indicator etc.) times the whole market implicitly due to reversion to the mean. It's an elementary argument."
2021-04-18 14:36:28,stocks,"It's hard to tell who or what to trust because there are so many rules and sayings yet when you hear enough of them in totality you basically have a holy text that you can subjectively use to support or reject any position you want. It's like it's all dependant upon luck (not *just* luck mind you!) and no one truly knows what they're talking about when their logic is dissected, it's all irrational at the core."
2021-04-18 11:21:04,stocks,Markets being ‚Äúup‚Äù is just an many companies stock value rising at the same time. Timing either an individual stock is just the singular of timing the market
2021-04-18 10:47:55,stocks,"Yeah the timing argument is kind of misleading. 

Timing is only one element of which performance is the main focus. 

I think valuing the market is a much more reasonable idea than timing the market. In this instance anyway."
2021-04-18 13:22:28,stocks,"At the risk of being pedantic I've gotta point out that if they're undervalued companies *now* then the time very much does matter, now is the time to buy them."
2021-04-18 10:42:34,stocks,True. But Warren didn‚Äôt sell cuz he was fearful. It was cuz he didn‚Äôt believe in the business anymore.

2021-04-18 11:06:18,stocks,"Not really. But I am under the impression that government arrangements tend to have unpleasant things for investors. Government getting stocks, diluting the ownership of existing owners. At least in Europe this is the case."
2021-04-18 17:46:38,stocks,You could have bought about anything at those prices last year and it would be looking pretty good about now. Berkshire has been pretty underwhelming the past 10-15 years.
2021-04-18 19:18:13,stocks,Well just pull your money out after summer.
2021-04-18 13:54:07,stocks,"A lot of people‚Äôs goal, including mine, is to beat or at least match the S&P. Since you can see which companies are in it you can choose the best performers with the best long term track record and try to match. Then throw in a few small and mid cap companies to see if you can catch a few winners. Just diversify and dont freak out on downturns Bc, hopefully, you picked companies you believe in and think will be around in 30 years so just wait it out. Or, if you wanna get crazy, buy more positions in those companies when the market is down."
2021-04-18 10:27:19,stocks,I was looking to buy this year but held off. Homes are being overbid ask price by 10 even 20%. It‚Äôs insane. I‚Äôm no expert and have no idea how long that will last but I can‚Äôt afford it.
2021-04-18 12:15:24,stocks,"I also work in the industry and historically when everyone is confident and buying houses that are 20% above ask, it usually doesn‚Äôt end well."
2021-04-18 10:31:17,stocks,Household debt had hit a record low bud...

2021-04-18 12:25:42,stocks,And most people here will underperform for this reason because only a very small percentage of people have the skill or luck to beat the market doing this.
2021-04-18 12:06:29,stocks,A wall street trader doesn't even have a choice. He will get evaluated every 3 months. If I feel like there is too much euphoria and can sleep better at night with cash on the sidelines for 3-6 months I'll 100% do that.
2021-04-18 12:20:30,stocks,"I think for a retail investor tuned into a handful of stocks, timing the market might be possible to a reasonable extent, but you make a really good point overall. 

The thing to keep in mind here is I feel the general retail investor has more flexibility in being able to quickly close/open positions in securities than the big firms or funds have, but I would expect them to generally be much more informed about the data and trends. For me this just goes back to being informed about each of your investments and having the confidence of supporting the company as an entity rather than simply seeing it as a ticker."
2021-04-18 14:47:21,stocks,"haha oh man thats a hard one to predict at that time. I would have done the same tbh. Nothing wrong with taking  profit, though!"

2021-04-18 19:45:05,stocks,"I'd love to see inside his mind on that JPM sell off. As I remember he sold in the 90's / early 100 price per share, which is of course much lower than its current $150+ or so. 

Not sure why he did, but I'd love to know. As far as I can tell JPM has a balance sheet that is just.. unreal in terms of how quality it appears, and it was trading well below most DCF intrinsic value marks back in the 90s and low 100's.. to my estimation by about 25%. 

But if long term we look back and it was a poor decision, he has plenty of others in its company, such as the airline sell off, selling off petro china too early, getting into IBM as a last ditch tech investment instead of focusing on Amazon and Apple. He's the greatest investor of all time, but he is still a man, still bleeds."
2021-04-18 16:26:25,stocks,"Alright. Cool, thanks for the info. I've seen people who buy far out contracts to minimize Theta decay and I've seen people do what you do more or less. I'm more in your camp either way. One month out seems like the sweet spot. 

And yeah, I meant for short term holding of the short ETF.  You'd have to be mad to hold one longer than a couple months max."

2021-04-18 13:25:26,stocks,"I think people still wrongly see MSFT as a fading giant, lagging behind Apple‚Äôs innovation. They‚Äôve made some pretty solid investments in their future as a company and arguably has better management than Apple at this point."

But you can still compare them."
2021-04-18 11:58:21,stocks,So sell off your portfolio for cash then
2021-04-18 13:06:54,stocks,Or in a couple of years.  I think you missed his point.
2021-04-18 15:48:57,stocks,"Last time it took 12 weeks.

It's fine to hold your stuff if you bought in cheaply. It's bad to hold if you got in at close to the current ATHs."
2021-04-18 11:52:25,stocks,"What ""cult"" are you referring to?"
2021-04-18 15:31:45,stocks,Sorry I still don‚Äôt get it...what happens when uvxy gets really low?
2021-04-18 15:09:59,stocks,What happened in 2018?
2021-04-18 12:46:58,stocks,"See, that‚Äôs the thing though, those March ‚Äúlows‚Äù were the same price as Dec 2020.

That doesn‚Äôt make a bargin like the 2018 dip or the Covid dip. That‚Äôs just coming back to somewhat normal after a unreal run up."
2021-04-18 14:14:51,stocks,Very important clarification. Agree 100%
2021-04-18 17:31:37,stocks,"This is the right take. Anyone who says they can predict when the market will dip is lying. But anyone can see when the market is dipping.

HOWEVER, waiting and saving your money to buy in dips is almost never the right move. You could be waiting *years*. So by all means invest steadily at a rate you can support. In dips, invest more by making temporary and drastic lifestyle changes to take advantage. Then you can throttle back down to your normal rate.

But you should never say ""There's no dip, I shouldn't be investing."" which is why the guy who was talking about using this for ""entry points"" is kind of full of shit imo."
2021-04-18 15:43:19,stocks,But that implies you hadn't been buying before that point...
2021-04-18 15:44:10,stocks,Which stocks are currently low?
2021-04-18 17:45:21,stocks,poor guy made it two comments deep before he forgot what was said in the OP
2021-04-18 15:59:03,stocks,"A money fund is probably slightly better than cash.  Right now it's only VERY slightly since rates are so low, but returns will go up with inflation.  

Downside is selling it takes a day."
2021-04-18 15:21:08,stocks,"True. Thanks for the reassurance. I just know a lot of people sayin im stupid for having cash.   
It def helps me sleep at night too besides having dry powder to jump on a good investment as it comes up."
2021-04-18 18:11:49,stocks,That's quite the blanket statement. Growth stocks suffer during high inflation period. Value stocks tend to do quite well.

2021-04-18 15:03:28,stocks,"Wait what? No. Waiting on the sidelines to get into the market based on some indicators is definition of market timing. 

Rebalancing your portfolio to stay exposed to the factors you already wanted to be invested isn‚Äôt timing the market at all."
2021-04-18 14:46:47,stocks,"I think that no one-liner should be taken as an absolute rule in investing because the subject is way too complex for that. All of them have various qualifiers and contexts. Most people around here throw them around like articles of faith without having thought about them in any depth. Even worse, some people imagine that they are really clever because they read some basic study funded by self-interested parties and took it as religious mantra without thinking more profoundly about it.

There has been a lot of propaganda made for certain ideas, which is why they have become articles of faith for some people. Such as the false belief that index investing is somehow ""safe"" (even though you can't diversify away market or macroeconomic risks in any given market) or that there is no way to beat it. Also ""time in the market beats timing the market"" and other such trivia which act as thought stoppers rather than markers of wisdom."
2021-04-18 11:23:21,stocks,"Yes, but timing a singular stock is very different from timing a market. A single company can profit while the market goes down, they‚Äôre completely different. As an example, a country can experience economic problems while someone in that country is getting rich. You might not be able to time the country‚Äôs problems but if you work with that person getting rich and know exactly what they‚Äôre doing and how they‚Äôre doing it, that‚Äôs very different."
2021-04-18 15:36:02,stocks,"Timing implies you have foresight knowledge enough to predict and therefore remove all exposure before a certain time. Obviously impossible to do this consistently
 
Whereas with valuing the market, we assume you would reduce or increase your exposure as the level of aggregate (or specific) valuations become over - or undervalued. 

This makes slow drawdowns over the course of a cycle more attractive. And from an ideological perspective. If everyone had this idea instead of ""timing"" the market. We would be way less predisposed to enter bubbles and stages of irrational exuberance and eventually fear and capitulation which so often characterises market forces. 

Providing Better consistency and stability and way less opportunity for arbitrage and manipulation."
2021-04-18 14:09:09,stocks,Exactly my point - this is not timing a market.
2021-04-18 12:27:30,stocks,"I read something recently, or maybe it was from an interview on youtube, where Buffet talked about modern airlines being akin to railroads in the 19th century in terms of their volatility and profitability. I've taught history for 14 years and know enough about myself and the history of railroad expansion to know airlines are definitely not a lane I'm interested in. There are a couple I like as a business but not so much as an investment."
2021-04-18 15:57:14,stocks,No way! In America we socialize the losses and privatize the profits.
2021-04-18 11:39:01,stocks,"Yeah, I decided to quit looking. Houses get listed and have offers pending before I can even go look at them. My rent is super cheap, so I'm saving like a demon right now."
2021-04-18 12:19:53,stocks,I bought in June when the housing market was terrified. I bid 30k under asking and I was the only offer. They jumped on it immediately.
2021-04-18 13:31:39,stocks,Its because interest rates are low and material costs are sky high.

2021-04-18 11:08:50,stocks,"I don't understand what you're saying. This is from the federal reserve's website:

""According to the latest¬†Quarterly Report on Household Debt and Credit, total household debt increased by $206¬†billion (1.4¬†percent) to $14.56¬†trillion in the fourth quarter of 2020, driven in part by a steep increase in mortgage originations. The total debt balance is $414¬†billion higher than at the end of 2019. Newly originated mortgages, which include refinances, reached a record high of $1.2¬†trillion, surpassing in nominal terms the volumes seen during the historic refinance boom in the third quarter of 2003. Auto and student loan balances increased by $14¬†billion and $9¬†billion, respectively."""

2021-04-18 12:36:44,stocks,"I‚Äôm a new trader, joined back in February and I‚Äôve already tripled my portfolio thanks to day & swing trading. I use a combination of tracking flow setups, TA, alerts from many great discord groups (including pay-to-join ones) and tracking dark pool prints. 

The reason why most people lose money is because most people aren‚Äôt willing to put in the time to actually learn. I learned how to flow trade like a pro in less than 5 hours using free videos on YT and that alone is an easy way to get consistent profits. The only problem with flow trading is that you have to stare at your screen for hours (and you must pay attention at all times to get the full picture), and you could go days without a good setup. Some days you‚Äôll get 3-4 a day, other days you‚Äôll get 1 in a week. But once you find them, almost all of them will be profitable."

2021-04-18 14:34:34,stocks,"For sure.

MSFT is more conservative than AAPL and surely looks way less innovative when it comes to retail products, etc. 

But they own and run some extremely significant projects. Think about Exchange alone, or all the investment they‚Äôre putting on AI and future technologies. 

You know what, I think it all boils down to the point that I can see Microsoft‚Äôs overall direction and I think it‚Äôs stable, safe and reasonable. Regardless of if I use their products or not.

Apple, instead, has been taking some horrible decisions and really feels like a very greedy company who is not providing the value you used to pay for - but with increasing prices."

2021-04-18 09:59:21,stocks,Yeah I'm not gonna start arguing with someone of his kind.
2021-04-18 19:41:07,stocks,"To be non-snarky for a second, one thing I hate about those studies is that they are always so long term.  I've made loads of money swing trading and buying individual stocks on sale, or industries/ETFs when they were out of favor.  None of these follow the market per se.

I regularly swing trade some stocks and get 4-5% in a week or two.  I cant' do this every week and get 100% or whatever a year because no stock dips that much, but I bought and sold boring stocks like VZ and MMM and BBY and JNJ multiple times and made a heck of alot more than if I bought and held."
2021-04-18 15:21:53,stocks,"December 2018 there was a big sell off.  20% ish.  Didn‚Äôt last long but it was a great buying opportunity, just like March 2020."
2021-04-18 15:40:07,stocks,"The Fed was raising interest rates and the market sold off.  It will likely happen again when the Fed has to start raising rates again someday.  Interest rates go up, P/E ratios come down."
2021-04-18 17:44:54,stocks,the fed stopped QE and started raising interest rates
2021-04-18 13:16:59,stocks,You had the chance to buy in March what you missed out on and didn't see 3-4 months ago. That's still a great opportunity. 10% corrections on average are only every 16 months. Bigger crashes are every 7 years. Take what you can get. If you are really looking to time the market and only buy on those big dips you'll miss out on gains in the long run.
2021-04-18 14:26:53,stocks,"It's not a stock market. It's a market of stocks.
Some stocks like AMZN FB ADBE were at levels not seen since June 2020 just a lil over a month ago.
The high p/s growth stocks however really haven't dipped all that much"
2021-04-18 13:04:24,stocks,This wasn't crash but deep correction so it was great entry point fir growth stocks.
2021-04-18 14:32:02,stocks,So you are saying that some of these tech stocks right now are at not normal price points? The point is that stock corrections and crashes don‚Äôt happen often but when they do its a good time to have some cash saved up on the side and take advantage of them.
2021-04-18 15:50:18,stocks,"Not really, you can see the opportunity and add to a position."
2021-04-18 18:25:12,stocks,Goldman Marcus account gets 0.5% interest. Better than any money market.

2021-04-18 15:39:53,stocks,Your definition of market timing is very narrow.
2021-04-18 14:30:54,stocks,And were speaking on long trendlines. This is more 'i believe this company is worth 2x this so I'll invest now; regardless of today's price action' vs 'spy puts because it always dips on 5/12' or whatever
2021-04-18 14:39:34,stocks,There is a market in every given security (a market simply means that you have buyers and sellers) just as there is an overall market in all securities taken together. You can approximate the latter by looking at the market in a [total market index](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/markets/101515/4-best-total-market-index-funds.asp).

Now all of a sudden all of these no-name places are seeing booms.  I either expect the prices/activity to level off or reverse.  I do not want to buy as part of the frenzy though!"
2021-04-18 13:02:06,stocks,That would be called good timing.
2021-04-18 16:18:36,stocks,"Yep! Stole my house. Feb.28th, 2020 I closed just in time. Still wrapping my mind around how lucky I got. House up 20% already."
2021-04-18 13:46:10,stocks,Interests rates could remain low for some time. But supply chains will eventually open up. What happens when low interest rates and low material costs combine? Anybody‚Äôs guess. What if foreclosures start flooding the market? Also anybody‚Äôs guess.

The only way out of 0 percent rates, stagflation and maybe even hyperinflation down the road is someone in the u.s. inventing the new internet or railroad or something that finds a way to boost goods and services past the amount of printed money and the government to drastically cut spending, the second of which is preventing the first and the second is unlikely to ever happen."

2021-04-18 17:44:14,stocks,"Define fast travel. Autonomous cars are right around the corner. Cars don't sound fast, but think about this anecdote.

I used to have an 8 hour drive from where I lived to my parents house. That sucks right, definitely want to fly right? 

However, when you add up driving to the airport (1hr), arriving 1-2 hours early to make it through security and board the plane, a 3hr flight, and then making it to baggage claim and driving from the other airport to my destination (1-1.5hr), I've spent almost the same amount of travel time while racking up a bunch of extra costs for the ""convenience"" of air travel.

Now imagine that 8hr drive when it's fully Autonomous. you can read a book, watch a movie, sleep, eat, whatever. your own personal private mode of transportation without any effort. it will be the death blow of regional airline travel.

Yes, that tech is still probably years away, but if you invest when the technology is already proven and implemented, you're behind."
2021-04-18 14:09:21,stocks,"You personally take the flights, and let the next current fool/business continue to lower prices where they stagnate until the next round. 

Look at the shale ‚Äúboom‚Äù. Sure, we as consumers will welcome $45/bbl oil, but all that innovation and boom didn‚Äôt really give the investors any returns. 

This is happening in many industries. Lots of demand, but low moat and high competition means no returns. Weed, Renewables, half the upstart fintech, EVs."
2021-04-18 14:07:58,stocks,"Definitely, there isn't one yet. But that's just the thing- the railroads, at least from an American perspective, were essentially the same in the second half of the 19th century, and yet, for example, many went bankrupt within years of completion despite huge help from the government, relative to the time period. Maybe in both cases, we are talking about the most efficient service available at the time but not necessarily the most efficient market for that service? I imagine there's a lot of commonalities between the two.

To be clear I believe there's money to be made in airline investment and don't presume to tell anyone else anything about what they choose to invest in. I think for the most part it's just not for me. Are there any airline companies you're big on? It seems that industry could be ripe for a big swing over the next year or more if things continue to improve with COVID. Do you think this is already priced in with these stocks?"

2) That is the straight forward explanation, but it skips some of the nuance. When you are buying an ETF you are buying a fund that lists units on an exchange for purchase.

It depends on the Etf. Some etfs follow an index, some etfs have stocks from companies, no matter what sector it is.

2021-04-18 00:00:00,stocks,"A plea for the dividend Many investors nail down ""dividend investing"" to a % number. In my opinion the current dividend yield isn't even half the story of what dividend investing is about. And also I believe dividend investing is a very bad term. You're not investing in a dividend, you're investing in a company that happens to distribute some of it's profits to shareholders in cash which is called a dividend. Depending on the circumstances these realized gains are taxed, but by having realized the gains you've taken out some risk from the investment without having to reduce your stake in the company. Even if a company goes bankrupt you can have a positive ROI if you've collected enough dividends along the way.

Personally, I don't invest in companies which don't pay a dividend. This is because companies that pay a dividend know their damn purpose. If a company is committed to paying a dividend and has been doing so over a long period of time that has an effect on the management. Guess which company will use profits in a more responsible fashion for investing in the company, the one thats just throwing any profits they get into potential growth or the ones that only have 50% of profits available for investment? The dividend has a discilipining effect on the company. Some companies have hard commitments to increase their dividend every year. Often they already have a pretty high payout ratio. This commitment forces them to look for new growth opportunities and to be as efficient as possible with their expenses. Some companies don't manage to increase their profits for years yet their keep their dividend sustainable by finding ways to cut costs.

Some dividend yields are distracting, on both ends of the spectrum. MSFT for example has been an incredible dividend grower. A dividend yield of currently 0.86% may seem low now but they've been growing the dividend at such a rapid pace that the yield will increase significantly over time if they continue to do so. When I bought MSFT in 2016 the dividend yield was slightly above 2%. Now my dividend yield based on what I paid for MSFT is 3.73%. The reason the MSFT dividend yield is so low now is because the market has priced in more future growth. This goes both directions. The reason some dividend yields are so high is because the market has priced in future decline. Which is bad news for the sustainability of a dividend. XOM and T may be examples of yields that aren't sustainable like GE and KHC turned out not to be sustainable. If these companies will have to cut their 6 to 7% dividend that I don't know, but the risk of that happening is certainly higher than with a company like MSFT that is only distributing a fraction of it's profits as a dividend. Even if a company pays just a small dividend I'd take that over nothing or too much because they can grow that dividend over time and if you hold long enough the yield based on what you paid can get into ridiculous areas.

**The dividend is what keeps things real** and I don't only see it as a way of realizing profits but also as a filter to filter out bullshit companies. Sure that way some opportunities are missed but yet my dividend paying only company portfolio has outperformed the S&P 500 over the last 5 years by quite a bit and some companies have increased their dividend significantly since I bought them (MSFT, BLK, PG, SAP, UL, JNJ heck even O managed reasonable dividend growth despite covid and an already high dividend yield). 

By holding these high quality dividend companies I have an ever increasing cashflow into my portfolio without having to sell shares and I can use that cashflow to enter new investments which then again start contributing to my dividend cashflow. I don't have to put a single thought to selling as long as I believe these companies are paying their dividend in sustainable fashion. This means I also don't have to care about market valuation as long as decreasing valuation isn't because of reasons seriously threatening the business of my companies. 

I believe this way of investing is not only more mentally endurable but also more successful in the long run compared to trading around hyper growth stocks. I realize many don't have that much money to invest and the dividends they initially get may seem laughable, but I guarantee 99+% of people that enter the stock market with a get rich quick mentally will sooner or later get beaten down badly."
2021-04-18 08:54:55,stocks,"Dividends are misleading because share buybacks do the same thing while being more tax-efficient. Many companies that don't pay dividends, buyback shares.

It's quite easy to look at the full picture by referring to the Financing Cash Flows on the Cash Flow Statement.

It shows debt repaid, dividends paid and shares repurchased. Dividends paid and shares repurchased are both capital returns to the shareholder. 

This is important because by focusing on dividends only, you're ignoring companies that always return capital via buybacks.

Look at FB, they've bought back stock for the past 4 years. The amount of shares they bought in 2020 is equivalent to 0.7% yield at current price but you don't get taxed on it.

ADBE buybacks in 2020 is equivalent to 1.1% yield.

GOOGL buybacks in 2020 is equivalent to a whopping 2.02% yield at current price. It would be >4% yield if bought in March last year.

Looking at dividends alone, TSLA and the above stocks look the same. But TSLA issues stock every year so they're complete opposites.

Companies like NVDA pay a dividend but recently they haven't been buying back stock, instead they've been issuing more stock than buying and they've taken on more debt. 

Looking at cash flow also helps you know which companies are on the net NOT returning cash to shareholders because they're diluting stock and/or adding debt to the balance sheet.

Anyway you will find many companies buyback more stock than they pay in dividends (like MSFT) so you are missing half the yield. All these companies could buyback 0 stock and instead pay it all as a dividend and their yields would jump dramatically e.g. MSFT yield would be over 2% including buybacks.

I prefer buybacks as they make more money long term.

Dividend -> Pay Tax -> Reinvest provides lower increase in ownership than company direct buybacks."
2021-04-18 09:19:28,stocks,"Agree with the points but there is a clear counterpoint to this:

‚ÄúGuess which company will use profits in a more responsible fashion for investing in the company, the one thats just throwing any profits they get into potential growth or the ones that only have 50% of profits available for investment?‚Äù

There‚Äôs an argument to be made that paying out investors who have contributed nothing to the company is a poorer use of capital than investing back into the business. If 100% of profits are available for investment then the company may not have to issue debt or have a secondary offering to raise capital. 

I think a mix of value (dividend) and growth is prudent here. Simply because the big dividend payers are typically mature companies not looking for growth‚Äîthey may be steady and less volatile, but you sacrifice the potential for a boom. You sacrifice innovation if you go with what only works in the present."

2021-04-18 10:32:43,stocks,"Buy backs are really not efficient unless the company is paying a dividend. Buy backs raise the share price by lowering supply (demand remains the same). It directly increases your % ownership if you don't sell sure, but to take advantage of a buy back you have to sell shares. Also if you hold and the market turns bear then unless you're holding some obscure company not in any index/etf the share price will go down potentially negating the price increase of the buy back - plus investor spooks. Buy backs also do not always permanently increase the price, they can occur at the same time a large holder sells.



Don't get me wrong, I have plenty of stocks that don't pay a dividend - but saying buy backs are more efficient is simply not true. Not saying dividend is end all be all, because there are plenty of cases where comparing companies the price goes up enough from a buyback to beat many dividend yields (again if you sell). The really only big implication is buy backs increase your % ownership, and reinvesting dividends does the same thing but it's your choice."

Of course the question if that actually is/was the case is a completely different one, but I prefer such a move compared to companies buying back shares at any valuation. Also even if in terms of taxes a buyback is preferable, it doesn't solve the problem that stock has to be sold to realize gains and then you have to pay taxes anyway. I prefer a steady flow of taxed dividends compared to having fiddle around with when to sell how much of which stock."

2021-04-18 10:16:06,stocks,"Yes, buybacks are tax efficient, but I read this post as having a steady return through dividends. As you mentioned, buybacks are done when the company wishes to and is not predictable, like dividends with exdividend dates. For all we know, FB might not buy back shares for the next 5 years."
2021-04-18 11:55:28,stocks,"It is more efficient if you want to stay invested in the company. You‚Äôre basically buying the stock without paying taxes on gains. If you want to stay invested but instead of buy-backs, the company issued dividends, you‚Äôd have to pay taxes and then invest the remaining sum (which would be less than what you would have gotten with the buy-back).

If you want to de-invest from the company, you can do it by selling the stock yourself and then pay the tax to the tax man. 

So the dividend has the downside of not allowing you to stay invested as much as you would have, while having 0 upside compared to buy-backs."
2021-04-18 11:13:59,stocks,"I personally prefer buybacks but I can see why people prefer dividends.

If I wanted a steady cash flow from a company that only does buybacks e.g. GOOGL, then I would sell into their buybacks, so that my % ownership remains constant.

It would still be better tax-wise because I would only need to pay tax on the gain portion or if I bought some shares at a higher cost basis, no tax paid at all. However, it would involve more admin time.

That being said, the main reason I look at buybacks and dividends is to get a full picture of the capital return. I don't let it determine investment decisions. Some companies like TSM like to pay dividends, whereas GOOGL likes to do buybacks. Most companies have a more balanced mix."
2021-04-18 12:43:42,stocks,"Yes, it‚Äôs true that a drop in the price can negate the effect of a buy-back. But that‚Äôs not a reason to go for dividend stocks, since a decrease in price can also negate profits from dividends."

2021-04-18 10:19:59,stocks,"> ''Each year the number of companies in the S.& P. 500 not paying dividends grows,'' said Arnold Kaufman, the editor of S.& P.'s Outlook newsletter, which released the figures.

At the end of last year, 372 of the 500 companies in the index, the major index of large stocks in the American market, paid dividends. That was down from 402 a year earlier and 418 at the end of 1998. Most of the decline came from the fact that companies leaving the index, often because they were acquired by other companies, usually paid dividends while their replacements often did not.

https://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/03/business/markets-market-place-2000-fewer-companies-paid-dividends-investors-more-same.html

Here's a calculator to play with. Put in almost any good dividend stock. I tried JNJ, T, XOM, KO etc, they all lose. https://m.dividendchannel.com/drip-returns-calculator/"

2021-04-18 11:44:42,stocks,I think that's exactly his point.
2021-04-18 16:07:27,stocks,"A buy back doesn't net you any more shares than you started with. It just reduces the supply of shares which increases the price (demand being same). When you sell shares you're subject to taxes on gains. If the share price increases from a buy back and you sell shares the gain above cost is subject to taxes. If you are holding onto the shares with the never sell mentality then why even mention taxes. Otherwise dividends themselves cover the tax cost if you're not using a tax advantage account like 401k/IRA etc.


Less than you would have gotten with the buy back is not accurate."

Yields are down across the board over the past few years

The requirement to have a yield above 1% is even more disingenuous at it‚Äôs artificially skewing the results. All the companies I‚Äôve listed have been favorites of the dividend growth investing crowd for decades. Go search on articles and you‚Äôll see mountains for just these 4."
2021-04-18 16:41:28,stocks,"I think he might be referencing the benefit of the tax deferral.  Economically a dividend and a share repurchase are equivalent, but the share repurchase allows you to defer the gain for longer while dividends are taxable immediately. So all else equal, a share repurchase is better after tax than a dividend.  The effect is negligible over short periods of time, but can be huge with long holding periods. 

In addition share repurchases don't affect your cost basis, while dividends are added to your basis if you reinvest them.  If you live in the US you can ""wash out"" your gains when you die with a step up in basis effectively making your tax cost equal to zero for repurchases.  This only matters from an estate planning perspective, but is important for some."
2021-04-18 10:04:20,stocks,"Look at MSFT's 10Q.

It says they paid $4226M in dividends and $5750M in buybacks (cash flow figure is less because they issue additional shares too). Also you can see it on the stockholder equity statement.

While the heat pump technology isn't new, the extreme push for decarbonization is. California has already adopted aggressive green goals. And in order to achieve these goals, there needs to be changes in both how energy is generated as well as how end-users consume it. 

What this means for the average consumer is a switch from gas powered equipment to electric, whether it's gas furnaces or water heaters, or gas stove ranges. There's going to be giant pushes for residential electrification. 

It goes beyond just simple electrification though. There's going to be a lot more renewable energy generation and battery storage in the future as well.

2021-04-18 13:35:55,stocks,"Hydrogen ignites at a much lower concentration in air than natural gas, which means there will often be less energy in the explosion when it happens.

The problem with hydrogen is distribution. The systems have to handle higher pressures and be a lot tighter because the molecules are much smaller and will leak out of smaller cracks and holes, and will just leak out through more materials.

It also doesn't occur naturally the way natural gas does. Which means the cost of getting some to distribute is much higher. Even though all you need is water and electricity to create the stuff, and you get to sell oxygen, purified water, and precipitated trace elements as byproducts."

2021-04-18 00:00:00,stocks,"Time to trim down margin From what I see going into earnings season is we have a massive move upwards in April so far, I also feel like earnings will most likely all be good. But my worry right now is good news being too priced in and it being a classic example of sell the news. I'm very bullish for this year but I think we will continue to see healthy pullbacks after each run. 

I suggest if you're like me, and use margin to a decent extent, now would be the time to take SOME of the profits and wait for a little downturn to buy more. I do not suggest at all pulling out completely because that would be stupid, this market is going up overall, but I fear margin users may have gotten too comfortable and a resurgence in volatility may happen going into may-june. 

It would be nice to see a little pullback just to pick up some good bargains, because honestly, stocks are expensive right now. So my two cents, free up some of that money to buy some dips and get right back in. If you're using leverage, take the profits it has beseeched you and wait for an opportune time to put it to work again. I think margin is a great tool in these market cycles when used wisely, and cautiously. 

I use margin so that I don't have to be too greedy with my own money, I instead can be safe with my brokers, and still get a nice slice of pie. But the risk of leveraging losses during a volatile market is something I don't want to risk.

I also am not trying to spread any fear at all, this is a bull market, but I also advise to keep a close eye on your account if you use margin and make sure that you have quality names right now. Can never get too comfortable, and when it's calm like this it is the time to be prepared, especially when you have the capitol to properly protect yourself for relatively cheap."
2021-04-18 10:58:13,stocks,"Indeed.

One strategy is to use margin in dips to load up on oversold stocks and sell on the upswing to pay back the debt and free the margin for the next dip.

My question is, am i charged interest on a margin account for purchases made with funds that would incur a good faith violation on a cash account? 
I.e 
Sell stock A day 1 for profit.
Buy stock b on day 1 with unsettled funds from stock A
Sell stock B on day 1, which was purchased with unsettled funds from stock A but this isnt a problem as far as violations on margins accounts as i understand it.
Buy stock C on day 1.

All with the same , say 30k. 
Am i charged margin interest on my holdings in stock C until the sale of stock B settles, assuming these trades were the entirety of my cash balance?
Like is that why i cant incur a good faith violation on a margin account, because id be extended margin and charged interest until funds settled in this sequence of events?  This is all in the context of i would never be purchasing more securites than my cash balance, leverage itself would never be used."

2021-04-18 10:17:56,stocks,"You can trade with unsettled funds, and in an account with more than $25,000 margin you can essentially free ride without paying interest. The unsettled funds that you use for trading though count against your margin until they settle, which for whatever reason almost always takes the full 2 days. You'll see your buying-power numbers drop in the meantime, so you can know when to stop trading.

If for some reason they don't settle, then that amount that counts against your margin turns into a loan.

I'm not sure whether they charge the interest from that point or from the point that you actually made the trade.

This is the kind of question where you should actually be phoning your broker and asking until you get the right person to tell you the answer without any guessing. You don't want to find out the hard way that their procedure is a little different from someone else's."

Hi


So I am sort of a new investor, I have read a lot on investopedia and YouTube about stocks and investing. I already maxed my Roth IRA and have some money in a taxable brokerage. However I am confused on one thing.

I buy apple stock for 100 dollars today, one year later I buy another apple stock for 120 dollars. 3 months later I decide I want to sell my apple stock. It would be smart to sell the apple stock I bought a year ago to get long term capital gains benefits. However, how can I do this? 

Basically, can If I buy VTI shares every month, can I choose which VTI to sell(older first)."
2021-04-17 23:11:44,stocks,"Your broker should allow for this to automatically happen using FIFO (first in, first out). Basically what it means is whatever you bought first will be what goes on a tax statement. There should be somewhere in your account settings that allows you to set it, but usually it is the default setting."
2021-04-17 23:19:20,stocks,You should be able to select & sell shares that you bought at specific times & specific prices when executing a sale.
2021-04-17 23:32:17,stocks,FIFO Is not an option with TD direct investing. The prices just get averaged out.

2021-04-17 23:15:36,stocks,Time in the market beats timing the market.
2021-04-17 23:23:17,stocks,"Yep.  But definitely don't assume FIFO is the default.  

You shouldn't even rely on interpreting web/app if the instructions aren't 100% clear.  

Contact your broker personally via a phone call if there's even 1% doubt.  And if you can't reach an agent that can answer a question like this, or any other (during normal business hours)... you need to dump that firm and find another.

Your brokerage firm works for you, they literally only make money because of you.

I hate to sound 'old' but in this day of Robinhood type transactions I think this gets forgotten.  Investment of your hard earned money should be taken seriously, and you want a broker that takes your questions/concerns seriously."

2021-04-18 00:00:00,stocks,"Is there a difference between borrowing margin (transfer margin cash to bank) and a personal loan? Why not just borrow margin under 3%? I had a circumstance where I had to get a 20k personal loan (covid times stuff), the personal loan was 7.5% and I paid it back in 5 months or so and that was that ‚Äî

Now to my question... I have a margin account with multiple brokers that I occasionally borrow 5% or so and was thinking would there have been a difference in just making a margin cash transfer to my bank?

Considering Interactive brokers is under 3% margin borrowing even with the free account (under 2% with the paid account) would I have been able to borrow for half the interest that way?

Before anyone gets into margin logistics and the possibility of a margin call (being the difference) just assume I would have been no where near that happening. I know this would not have been ideal, but neither was a personal loan, just wondering the answer"

Be prepared to receive an avalanche of criticism as to the thought of using margin. Margin is one of those things where the people that use it love it, and those that do not hate it.

I'd rather pay 1.57% to IBKR than the 5.99% I was paying to the original loan servicer."
2021-04-18 00:31:57,stocks,You should do it. Secured loans will always get better terms than unsecured loans. IBKR actually offers a debit card for this exact reason.

If you really want to do this, look at your credit cards. I'm assuming you have halfway decent credit if you could get a personal loan at that rate. 

There are some great offers out there for 0percent cash advance/balance transfer cards. Just keep the amount at a size that you can easily pay back in the alloted time before interested kicks in. 

I'm going to downvote hell for this but, eh.  I've been in a pinch before, really didn't want to get a personal loan, went this route and it worked out great."
2021-04-18 02:38:13,stocks,"Margin loan, esp from IBKR is golden... just make sure that you understand the margin call rules and you'll be fine. Those margin lending rules take into account stock volatility...

Have bought two houses this way..."
2021-04-18 08:22:37,stocks,"This is a risk vs. reward situation.

Here's the example:  

1) Borrow money to buy a house at 3% however the bank can sell the house right under me if my house value drops by 10%.

2) Borrow money to buy a house at 6%.

Option (1) is great for better off people (wealthy).  In fact, wealthy people routinely borrow money at a very low rate against their net worth. This is a win-win situation for both the bank and the individual.  As far as the bank is concern,  a guaranteed 3% is better than a 6% with a chance of default.

For the same token,  IBKR lets people borrow at very low rate (margin rate for major brokers are still much lower than personal loan, not just IBKR) because they know they can call back their loan any time for any reason.  Technically,  they can call the loan back even if the stocks are in the green - they won't do so since there's no point.  Keep in mind they also loan out your shares for a profit.  Forcing you to sell your shares is also take away this profit revenue. 

To properly make the call, you should always keep both views in mind:  what's in it for you and what's in it for them.

Taking the concept a step further.  When the wealthy buy insurance,  they don't sit there compare plans to see which one is $200/year cheaper.  They look at the plan in the view point that if the perfect storm hits, which plan prevents them from going bankrupt.  

I've been on both sides so I somewhat understand both view points.  There's no right or wrong ways."
2021-04-18 08:18:30,stocks,Wow I have literally never thought about this. Thanks for sharing. How do you go about doing this?
2021-04-18 08:42:44,stocks,"Margin call risk is exactly what's the difference. If you take out a loan, you pay the installments no matter what happens. If you buy through margin and your brokerage decides to change how much margin you can have (common during a crash!), you might still get margin called even though you were not even close to getting margin called before said crash.

If we are talking about 10% margin or sth, I really don't see any problems for you."
2021-04-18 04:59:17,stocks,"Leaving margin calls out of it, if you‚Äôre going long on securities they‚Äôre similar things, however margin accounts allow for trading in short positions directly."
2021-04-18 10:05:17,stocks,"If you get the loan at the bank and then sell the stocks you still have the loan at the bank and you still have the cash in your brokerage account.

If you get the loan from your broker and you sell the stocks, the cash from selling the stocks immediately pays the loan at the broker, and now you have less money in the brokerage account and no loan.

Two slightly different dynamics. But after you sell, it's as if you simply sold the shares to pay for the thing that you got the loan for.

If you intend never to sell the stocks then just get the loan where the interest is the lowest."
2021-04-18 10:51:07,stocks,"You‚Äôre not wrong and it can be a good idea depending on your portfolio. Borrowing on margin from your broker is a secured loan in essence, since you‚Äôre pledging your stocks as collateral. When you get a car loan, the collateral for the loan is the car itself which is a depreciating asset so the rates will be higher. A personal loans collateral is well your credit history and ability to pay and is unsecured so that‚Äôs at a different rate due to the risk to the lender. 

It‚Äôs easier to make money when you have money and this is one of the reasons why, access to cheap money and leveraging it in the way you describe."

2021-04-17 23:44:24,stocks,"I was told by a Schwab broker that ""margin is margin"", which seemed too good to be true, but considering its backed and pretty much 99% safe for them with collateral I guess I can see why -- I was just posting to make sure there were no strings attached that I wasnt seeing."

2021-04-18 00:13:45,stocks,"You can, the the broker told me I there is no difference in margined securities and withdrawn cash, I just wanted to make sure I wasn‚Äôt missing something"
2021-04-18 00:37:15,stocks,"Same. The problem is that people are quick to assume that other investors that use margin are new to investing or gambling yolo plays. I have a credit score of 800+, over 200K in investable assets, and most of it in liquid index funds. I also have over 30k in cash in an emergency fund. Using 14k margin is not going to bankrupt me.

By all means, using a margin loan at 1.57% seems like a no-brainer for me. I might even use it to buy a house in the future, instead of going the traditional mortagage route. IBKR uses the Federal Funds Rate (FFR) as its benchmark and adds a little extra for their cut. The last time that the FFR was at 3%, which is where mortgage rates are today, was like in peak 2007. There is no way the Federal Reserve will raise it that high again in the next few years.

Based on the description that you mentioned, yes, I would use them over a personal loan."
2021-04-18 00:23:39,stocks,"No. Percentage is always quoted annualized. The [1.57%](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/accounts/fees/pricing-margin-rates.php) is the annual rate. Interest is accrued daily and paid monthly though. Since taking my loan, I have accrued around $5 in interest. In annual terms that comes to around 1.60%"

2021-04-18 14:04:12,stocks,"Let me make sure I got this straight:

1. Get necessary cash for margin you want with less than 2 percent APY. 
2. Buy stocks with the original cash. Risk of margin call but couldn‚Äôt this more or less be avoided by getting bond ETFs?
3. Put extra margin money from brokerage to checking account?

Am I missing something?"
2021-04-18 16:06:50,stocks,"No thats basically it, and the beautiful part about it also is there is no payment due dates. So if only month you want to put extra in, but next month you dont want to pay at all, the brokerage doesnt care. The riskiest part about all this is that right now interest rates are low, so if you got a conventional mortgage, they will be the same for the duration of the loan, while your margin rates MAY go up, not will."
2021-04-18 00:00:00,stocks,"600k portfolio, Should I be more diversified? Hello all,

Before I begin, I would like to thank each and every member of this sub for their contributions. I began my investing journey in February 2020 as a 39 yr old, newly divorced man. I guess the timing couldn‚Äôt have been better, as I‚Äôve watched my net worth grow from 120k-600k in 14 months. My son was just born 6 weeks ago and I‚Äôve noticed my portfolio shrink by 15% even as the market has reached ATH. Highly speculative stocks brought me incredible returns, but now that I have a son, I think I should tone down the risk a bit. Since r/stocks and other investing subs have been so instrumental in my early stock market education, I thought I would solicit ideas to help diversify my portfolio. 

Here is what I own, after selling a bunch of spacs and a few other speculative assets. 

‚Ä¢Pins -13% 
‚Ä¢Net- 12%
‚Ä¢Sq- 10%
‚Ä¢Nike-7%
‚Ä¢SCHD-7%
‚Ä¢ENPh-5%
‚Ä¢Etsy-5%
‚Ä¢Se-5%
‚Ä¢Stmp-5%
‚Ä¢Jmia-4%
‚Ä¢Nvda-4%
‚Ä¢Crsr-3%
‚Ä¢Gan-3%
‚Ä¢Paysafe-3%
‚Ä¢Boeing -3%
‚Ä¢CNI- 3%

Cash- $25k 

I was thinking of adding Disney and JPM, but I would very much appreciate any other suggestions. Thanks again!

Edit: I probably should have told ya‚Äôll, I added most of these positions in February when I sold my 2000 shares of GME for a life changing amount of money. I had small positions in all these stocks in 2020, but was able to add significantly to all of them once I exited GME between $200-300. My portfolio went from $186k to $600k in a matter of weeks, and I don‚Äôt play with options either. 

And most of this is in various IRA‚Äôs and an HSA. Only have $200k in a taxable brokerage account with positions I plan on holding until Powell raises rates next year or the year after. 

These are excellent suggestions regarding index funds. I will research a few and trim a lot of these or sell outright and start in index funds."

2021-04-17 22:33:23,stocks,">I‚Äôve noticed my portfolio shrink by 15% even as the market has reached ATH.

that's because the market is thousands of stocks, and you have about 15 stocks many of which are trendy/hot, and those always cool off. for example, you have zero exposure to ... insurance companies, which have been doing very well. so I think you need to beef up the holdings in ETFs or funds that cover more stocks and more sectors. I'd rather see 50% in SCHD, or options like VOO/SPY/IVV, or IWB, or VTI/VTSAX/FZROX. 

the usual recommendation is that single stocks should be more more than 10-15% of the overall portfolio. single stocks, even from the best companies, are much more volatile than a collection of hundreds or thousands of stocks."

2021-04-18 04:45:18,stocks,"""I‚Äôve noticed my portfolio shrink by 15% even as the market has reached ATH. ""

You're mostly in hypergrowth stocks that don't have a lot of earnings to back up their valuations. Lately these types of stocks have been suffering (except for NVDA which I own too). Due to the pandemic many of these received a once in a lifetime boost. 

PINS for example is not the kind of stock I'd be comfortable having my 13% of my 600k networth in. This company isn't even profitable. I mean maybe I would be but only if that position grew over many years and I have well founded conviction that this is fine. There are reasonably fast growing companies with a more down to earth valuation meaning better risk adjusted returns.

Personally I'd move most of this to more reasonalby of these valued companies maybe ones that pay a dividend or at least once that are profitable. Sure you can sit on this and hope for it to go even further, nobody knows what's gonna happen, but at $600k you've made it far enough, you don't need to take the risk you're currently taking in order to have a comfortable portfolio for retiring, unless $10MM is what you're aiming for."

I bought AMD when they announced the Ryzen 2.  All of these are multi year bubbles.

Because most people don't know how to identify a bubble before it starts this is why investors tend to use ETFs to round off those edges.  If one company bubbles the ETF holder profits.  If the company fails the ETF reduces exposure so they lose less.  It's like auto trading but you don't have to pay taxes on it.

Believe it or not, it's far easier to find the bottom than it is to find the top, so if you struggle finding the bottom, you're definitely going to struggle knowing when to sell.  I guarantee it."

VTI- 62.5%

SCHD- 15% 

QQQM- 15%

QQQJ- 7.5%

I plan to hold this for closer to 20 years to pay for kids colleges/ first cars and a few other things and then eventually turn it into a retirement fund. Anyways thats my above portfolio weights. QQQM/J are obviously HEAVY tech which right now and potentially for the next 5 years i could see out performing/ matching the market. Over time I plan to add more to VTI/ SCHD and just no longer add to the QQQM/J effectively decreasing the weight over time and decreasing some risk. 

I am debating on whether QQQJ is worth the hold or not tho. Im debating on whether something more like 

VTI- 60%

SCHD- 20%

QQQM- 20% 

Would be a much better position and then over time decrease QQQM to probably 10% and potentially increase SCHD to 30%.

2021-04-18 12:59:42,stocks,Shorting stocks is a type of margin trading. Even if you have the cash to cover it at the time of purchase/borrowing the downside is infinite and thus is done on margin.

If so, what's been your observations/returns, and over what period?

Most triple leveraged ETF to me seem to end up in a shit show at some point in time, but for some reason TQQQ seem to replicate fairly consistently the movement of QQQ.

I've toyed so many times with the idea of throwing $300-$500 into it every month, but every time get spooked out because I know all the inherent risks of tripled leveraged ETFs... But then also always kick myself for not doing it years ago, looking at the kind of returns it's had over the last 3 years / 5 years"
2021-04-17 20:57:08,stocks,"There's a sub or two about TQQQ and LETFs in general.  Lots of people having success with them,  but we're in a great market for it. 

There's a lot of leveraged ETFs that don't do well: JNUG and GUSH for instance.   These are industry  specific or commodity ETFs that really are for day traders. 

TQQQ is the top 100 or so NASDAQ stocks, so although it's tech heavy it does have some diversification to reduce industry concentration risk.  

If losing $500 would hurt you, then it's probably not a good place for you to put your money.   A little money management makes it easier. Buy when it dips, use a wide stoploss, be willing to accept risk."

Interesting article about the use of leveraged ETFs and their use for long term investing. the TLDR is that 2x leveraged ETFs may actually be optimal in most situations if you are looking to get into a position like TQQQ, QLD SPXL, etc. I personally have some in my roth since the huge upside can really put me ahead for retirement 30 yrs down the road from now. I'd most likely convert some of the position if it wins big and put it in unleveraged. I now make it a small portion of the portfolio and consider it my ""lottery ticket"" ETF. Is it works out great, if not I'm not going to being eating ramen for the next few months."

>But then also always kick myself for not doing it years ago, looking at the kind of returns it's had over the last 3 years / 5 years

that's called 'return chasing' and there's pretty strong data showing it's not a good strategy. everything runs in cycles in the market, and chasing last year's strong performers usually means getting in at the tail end of a hot streak just before it cools off and a new thing becomes the hot performer for a while. https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2014/april/chasing-returns-has-a-high-cost-for-investors

if anything, people should do the opposite of return chasing: put money into the funds/ETFs/strategies/sectors that have under-performed for a while. Morningstar has tested this, calling it ""buy the unloved"" and found it tends to out-perform investing in the hot stocks. https://news.morningstar.com/classroom2/printlesson.asp?docId=3028"

2021-04-18 11:34:54,stocks,Instead of throwing every month I would say only scoop them when it drops like >5%. And sell some of them when you feel like it‚Äôs high enough. In this way you will getting out some of the profit.

Read the prospectus for TQQQ and you‚Äôll notice it‚Äôs supposed to return 3x returns for underlying index on a daily basis. If you hold it for longer than that you run into decay and just the problem of leverage: falling 90% then rising 50% is not the same in TQQQ as it is in QQQ. 

As an investor, you shouldn‚Äôt care about past returns. They don‚Äôt give you info about future returns. If you‚Äôre willing to lose all your money though chasing this, then disregard. At that point it‚Äôs speculation."

2021-04-17 21:12:08,stocks,"I'm not sure the articles you linked to are on target for QQQ / TQQQ.  This isn't an industry ETF that waxes and wanes.  QQQ rebalances every quarter and so has the opportunity to add performing stocks and cull losers, no action needed on the part of the investor. 

The universe of stocks is limited to NASDAQ, but that's a pretty wide net to cast.  

As far as return chasing specifically,  TQQQ 10 year average is over 48%/yr.  This isn't a one year high flying ETF, this is consistent high returns.

To be clear,  these returns come with high risk!   QQQ might be a better choice for the risk adverse, 19.9% annual return isn't too shabby."

2021-04-18 10:57:43,stocks,"Someone posted about DCA on TQQQ recently,  I can't remember the sub.  Result is if you were starting out just before the dotcom crash then you'd be fine, but if you had a large TQQQ position going into the crash ($500k?) then 500/mo won't be enough to dig you out of the hole.

Texidian cherry picked bad timing by buying the high of dotcom craze and holding through the worst crash since the great depression.  Fair enough for worst case scenario, so I'll take the equal and opposite example.

If you bought TQQQ after the 2008 crash and held today, you'd make 300x your money.  QQQ returned 11x.

So buy the dip.  Use a stoploss.  If SPY is below the 200DMA, watch out and maybe get out.  If the market crashes, wait to get back in - look for bottom signs like a slowdown in the drop, put/call ratio turning, $MMTW falling below 20.  Look for the markets to turn up on high volume and DCA back in.

You can't avoid losses at the top or catch all the profit at the bottom, but the ticker is generous if you're not greedy."

Hey all! I'm pretty new to the investing community and finally had the motivation to actually do my own due diligence. I'm aware I'm a newbie so I started with an easy company to research, Facebook. Please feel free to leave any kind of feedback and suggestions for how I can improve my DD, any feedback will be much appreciated! (I am NOT a financial advisor).

**What is Facebook?**

* Mark Zuckerberg, current CEO launched FB in 2004 and first went into IPO at roughly $38 per share on May 2012.
* Facebook's Mission: ""Our mission is to give people the power to built community and bring the world closer together.""
* Facebook wants to built engaging products to enable people to connect and share with friends, family, and groups through personal devices. They want to help people discover new interests and learn about the world around them through people's opinions, ideas, photos, videos, and activities with their audience from their friends to the open public. 

**What are their products?**

* Facebook
   * social networking site that allows people to connect, share, discover, and communicate with friends and family online.
* Instagram
   * Social media network used as a photo sharing platform allows people to share photos, videos, and go live with their followers as a community and to discover new interests.
* Messenger
   * instant messaging application built on top of Facebook for people to connect to send messages to friends, family, and groups.
* WhatsApp
   * private messaging application used by people globally to text messages, voice messages, make voice and video calls and share a wide range of media.
* Oculus
   * Hardware, software, and developer brand centered around making products for consumers to experience virtual and mixed reality experiences to bring people together around the world to connect through virtual reality.

**How does Facebook make money?**

* revenue comes from selling advertising to marketers.
* advertisements enable marketers to reach out to individuals based on age, gender, location, interests, and user behavior.
* other revenue comes from Facebook's hardware and software products, such as Oculus.

**Pros?**

* leading social media platforms
* strong brand name
* strong advertising business
* effective marketing
* diversified business 

**Cons?**

* user privacy concerns
* most of revenue comes from advertising
* highly competitive environment
* FB banned in China, Iran, and other countries which could potentially increase FB's revenue

**Competitors? (based on the most recent info.)**

* Apple
   * According to Zuckerberg, apple is Facebook's biggest competitor.
   * apple will implement option for its users whether they want to share their information for ad-tracking
   * restricting facebook's ability to track data may impact their advertising revenues.
   * iMessage vs facebook messaging platforms
* Google
   * YouTube is leading second after Facebook for active social media users.
   * YouTube generated $6885 million of advertising revenue worldwide in Q4'20 compared to $3605 in Q4'18.
   * currently 1.78 billion YouTube users in 2019 and forecasted global users of 1.86 billion in 2021.
* Sony
   * competition in VR headsets with Oculus 

**Market Stats.**

* Roughly 65% daily active users
* 2.7 billion monthly users
* $28,072 million revenue generated in Q4'20
* $855 million revenue generated NOT from advertising
* Q4 Net income of $11,219 million

**Social Media Users Comparison (Jan. 2021)**

* Facebook (2740 Million)
* YouTUbe (2291)
* WhatsApp (2000)

**Why and it experiencing growth?**

* Continuing growth from users using social media platforms and monetization from ad revenues
* social media is a popular digital activity globally to connect with people and increasings its presence through mobile device usage.

**What will the business look in the next few years?**

* I think facebook will continue to experience growth in their social media platforms as increasing number of people are accessing the internet and increasing usage of mobile phones across the world.
* I also think Oculus with their VR products could possibly expand in the near future as the video game industry is worth $60.4 billion in the US, Oculus may have the potential to expand to provide capabilities in training learnings and sharing in the healthcare business and other industries.  

**Does the business maintain a healthy balance sheet, and maintain enough cashflow?**

* FCF of $3,318 million in Q4'20 compared to FCF of $9,222 of Q4'20.
* Shares outstanding are at an average of 2.8 billion shares from 2019 to present. In the past its higher shares outstanding reached a high of 2.9 billion in September 2017.  The decreasing of shares shows that each share of stock is worth more than it was in sept. 2017 and the company is possibly buying back its share to reduce the outstanding shares.
* FCF looks strong, increasingly more FCF over the last few years.

**How does management allocate capital?**

* The management seems to do well to allocate its capital to generate a net income of $11,219 million in Q4'2020 when comparing to $6,882 in Q4'18.
* Their operating margin is at 46% in Q4'20 and also 46% in Q4'18 shows the management is maintaining a good level to utilize their cash to generate profit through their daily operations and at the same time increasing more of their net income was the same operating margin levels in Q4'18.
* Management has been consistently owned more assets than liabilities even during their early days in the market, shows that the management play it safe with their capital.

**Does the business trade at a premium or a discount?**

* Facebook's current valuation is at a PE of 30.97 compared to the average of NASDAQ PE of 34.83.
* Past PE went to a high of 90.64 and went down in 2017 and stayed consistent at PE of 20-30 range
* when comparing Facebook's PC to the past, it looks more overvalued in the past than it is today, it think today it is a relatively fair price.

* Summary
* I think with Facebook's high growth it is experiencing right now is very good since I believe social media platforms will always be around as long as the internet is here to stay. I believe Facebook has a very strong brand as they are the the biggest leader in social media platforms to create certain algorithms for users to keep them using their products. This really shows their strong-marketing skills and getting those ad revenues.  With facebook acquiring Oculus a few years ago, they can definitely expand that brand into something more than just VR but to also use it for training in business and healthcare industry. However, they do face competition with Sony's playstation VR headset but the gaming industry is definitely going to grow in the next few years. At Facebook's current valuation PE of 30.97 I think it is sustainable and its forward PE is even lower which makes me feel a little more optimistic. However, some downsides of Facebook is the highly competitive environment they are in. According to Zuckerberg, Apple is Facebook's biggest competitor as Apple will be allowing users an option whether they want to share their information for ad-tracking. This could be a problem for Facebook if they are getting less information for ad-tracking which may impact their revenues, and most of their revenues do come from ads."
2021-04-17 22:49:23,stocks,I‚Äôll choose to not buy Facebook on the fact that I hate it. I hate them as a company and when I stopped using their product my life got better. Will I miss out on profits? Probably. But so be it.

Otherwise, massive runways for FB. If the US gov broke them up I wouldn‚Äôt be mad. That would unlock a lot of value, namely Instagram and WhatsApp. Once WA is monetized (see Asia for examples of successful models) then it‚Äôs really off to the races."
2021-04-18 00:30:03,stocks,"I'm long on FB too. Very solid company with a very solid base. Somehow they consistently are able to stick with the modern/latest social media trends and fight off competition. The only sticking point is generating revenue from Whatsapp which they paid 22 billion for and aren't generating a profit yet. But they plan to add transactions which could prove extremely lucrative. 

They have a large goal of helping to connect the globe and as we see internet expansion around the world with satellite internet their available customer base is only going to expand. 

They have become a one stop shop where you can browse, interact with friends/family, sell your used junk, and even explore the world with VR. Very few companies are able to adapt new ideas and combine them so effectively while reaching billions. Sure they have a lot more issues then many companies traditionally have to deal with (social media is always changing as humans are always looking to create/find new trends) Social media is not going anywhere and Facebook is determined to stay a leader. So far they have been extremely successful in staying there."
2021-04-18 01:27:48,stocks,"What is your play here? Facebook might grow in near and long term future, but the regulatory risk and risk imposed by device manufacturing companies like apple is huge.

I don‚Äôt think Facebook price is going to double down again in the next 2-4 yrs even. With so much risk in the play, one may be up for quite a ride. 

I would rather put my money in a stock like MSFT or Amazon"
2021-04-18 16:23:53,stocks,"FB is one of my oldest holdings.  I've pared it back a couple of times so that it doesn't overweight too much and am preparing to do so again soon though I think this run has more in the tank.  Thus I agree with your general summary that it's cheap relative to the market and is a cash printing machine.

I've also found that it is ridiculously susceptible to headline risk.  Last summer CNBC ran an entire campaign against it, using their promo commercial spots to feature snippets from the ADL and others quoting their boycott message.  They managed to drive down the stock price more than 20% before earnings and...poof...advertisers didn't budget despite the constant narrative otherwise.

I bring this up to say this:  My ownership of FB has been wrought with headline risk, and episodes like the above from Congress and/or media attacking an unsympathetic company are common.  As such, I've grown tired of holding the stock, and made much more trading calls on it after the major dips than I have in the shares I've held for years.

I can see it going above $350 soon, and I'll probably exit what I have left when it does.  It seems to always to be good for a massive pullback, and I'll likely only buy calls in the future when that happens."
2021-04-17 22:33:36,stocks,I‚Äôll buy some puts. Thanks OP. Facebook is mostly manipulative garbage.

2021-04-18 17:50:48,stocks,"It's just comical to me at this point that seemingly no other stock on the market seems to ignite investors' buried morality the way FB does.

Investors will morally rationalize their investments in companies that do FAR worse things to society and our planet.  Tobacco companies? Oil companies?

Darlings like Apple and Nike? I mean, hello? Slave and child labor anyone?  Coca Cola backing political assassinations in South America? No problem.  I guess because they do it in Third World countries it's out of sight, out of mind.  After all my data here in my first world society is more important than the life of a child laborer in India. Hey, it's an investment. It's about making money, not morals.

I‚Äôm actually thinking of buying in at Facebook under 300. Honestly before I did my DD I did have a small portion of Facebook because I know it‚Äôs a blue chip company and it‚Äôs pretty stable which was the only reason I bought before. But now I see more potential for Facebook to grow not only in North America but also globally as with wechat having a slight possibility orb being monetized. As for oculus, there is definitely room for it to innovate, things like VR, augmented reality are becoming more apparent now than it is few years ago. I can see Facebook adapting to these changes in the near future and another upside I really like is there increasing FCF and retained earnings and relatively low PE ratio compared to other faang.

I don‚Äôt think Facebook is going to double down like you said, but I think this company is a fairly stable company to hold on the long term imo. As yes there is definitely risk but we all have different risk tolerance!"

2021-04-18 00:00:00,stocks,"Nintendo (NTDOY) and Sony bear cases? I‚Äôve been increasing my shares in Nintendo for about a month now. This week I‚Äôm planning to dump my Qualcomm shares and move that money to additional Nintendo and Sony shares, as I‚Äôm over bought in the semi industry. 

I‚Äôm not much of a game player, and I‚Äôm not doing this out of some ‚Äúloyalty‚Äù. As far as I can tell both of these companies are wildly, criminally, inexplicably undervalued.

Can somebody help explain why this is and why  dumping 20% of my non-retirement monies into them may be a bad idea? 

Currently Apple, Walmart, Bank of America, GM, Intel, AMD, and eBay are where my options profits end up going. Nintendo and Sony would join that list."
2021-04-18 05:43:59,stocks,"I agree that Nintendo and Sony are both undervalued, especially Sony.

Nintendo's business is historically pretty cyclical at they've seen their fair share of ups and downs in their recent business history, maybe that's why it is trading at a discount compared to typical relative valuations for companies in their industry. But on the mid-term Nintendo's outlook is extremely strong and going forward I expect more resilience from the Switch platform than their past consoles/handhelds. I think the Switch as a platform/format is here to stay. Their IP's are evergreen and are among the biggest media IP's in the world (Pok√©mon & Mario mainly)(Yes I know Nintendo doesn't fully own Pok√©mon, but still a 36% stake). Switch is projected to outsell the PS5 this year.

So I think Nintendo is a good investment right now.

Sony Group is not a pure ""gaming stock"" like Nintendo. Sony Group's revenue is very diversified. As their name suggests it's a holding group that has a bunch of different businesses. Their businesses can be roughly categorized in production, licensing and/or distribution of  **media & entertainment** content (gaming, music, movies, TV shows, (non-US) TV channels, anime), **image sensors**, **electronics** (consumer and professional) and **insurance** (Japan & SE Asia).

You say you're overbought in the semi industry, but Sony Group themselves generates like 20% of their revenue from semiconductors, mainly in the subset of CIS (cmos image sensors) of the semi industry, but also from LTE chipsets through one their subsidiaries (though LTE chips are overall a very, very tiny part of their business). So keep that in mind.

Btw, something worth noting for Japanese companies is that over the past quarter the dollar and euro have increased in value against then yen. This is a good thing for Japanese companies that get most of their revenues from the non-Japanese market (like Nintendo and Sony). This should help boost Q1 earnings of Japanese companies with mainly international exposure.

I did a DCF analysis on Sony, and even in a mild bear case scenario they're currently trading at about their intrinsic valuation. So in a mild bull case they're trading below their intrinsic valuation.

I would also keep in mind that you're not necessarily going to find good investment advice for companies that have products that have a big reddit following and also have a big reddit following for a competing product. The reddit fanbase will either be wildly optimistic or wildly pessimistic and won't be able to look at the company from a more holisitic & considerate business point of view. It's like redditors that have been saying iPhones are going signficantly decrease in sales when they removed the headphone jack. (the opposite happened) A lot of these redditors are completely out of touch with the broader market tbh and only consider thing from their personal consumer experience point of view. Basically the reddit fanboy perspective is sometimes at odd with the average consumer perspective & overall market trend. This is applicable to stuff like PlayStation, Xbox and Nintendo imho. But also to a game company like EA (which is one of the most hated companies on reddit, but is actually a well managed company that makes good business decisions based on what the overall market demands, EA has been a very good stock investment over the past 5-10 years). Same thing with Apple vs Android manufacturers etc. Apple is enormously popular, but if you'd go by what you read on reddit you'd never realize how far reaching Apple's clout is.

>Can somebody help explain why this is and why dumping 20% of my non-retirement monies into them may be a bad idea?

Japanese companies in general are trading seem to have lower stock market valuations than American companies. That said for both Nintendo and Sony the vast majority of their revenue comes from non-Japan market anyway, so doesn't really make much sense to me."

LOL. This is how you proved you're clueless. The reception PS got for their [FIVE HUNDRED AND NINETY NINE DOLLAR console was infamously terrible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOHqG1nc_tw). It's a giant meme in the gaming industry. Sony LOST that entire generation of gaming to Xbox. The PS3 was a failure. The PS4 - which was a huge success - sold at 400$ and it was made at a loss. Sony recouped their money handily by doing what they should have in the first place.

>Video games as well should be priced higher than what they were 15 years ago because of inflation too, so there's nothing wrong with that

Further proof of stupidity and cluelessness about the industry. Games nowadays are chock-full of microtransactions and all kind of exploitative tactics to make money beyond the base price - which atm very few COMPLETE games have. Nintendo's among the few developers to not push the envelope in this direction for their console games, though they're extra-exploitative in the mobile market.

WRONG. Stadia is 100% Free. You do not need to subscribe. Subscription is just for 4k and free games. Stadia's online multiplayer is also 100% free as are a few titles to try the service.

>My biggest issue is just needing internet to play your game which, unless it's multiplayer, no game should ever need as you can never guarantee your internet connection uptime.

Wrong again. Many single player titles on console and pc require internet. Sometimes for gameplay elements but also due to pure greed from the publishers.

How about, ‚ÄúI never buy gold‚Äù short love affair aside, diversification is better and how much one can diversify depends on how capable one is at doing it. Somehow people think that means 10 or less, when it has been shown it has to be at least 20. Optimal number upwards 50.

For systemic risk, that can be dealt with by also owning stocks traded in other currencies, nations and owning some REITs, investment companies, commodities and other perhaps bond ETFs and funds for fixed income.

If you can diversify by 50 stocks and do it well, then it is better than owning half or a third. It more than anything depends on what you are capable of doing, how much time and effort you can afford and of course if you are smart.

I personally manage more than 50."

2021-04-18 00:00:00,stocks,"What criteria do you use to justify buying a stock vs. Just owning VTI or VOO? Mine is usually the obvious in that I think the stock will outperform the index over either a short or long time frame.

But I'm wondering if some would also buy certain stocks as a larger holding as a defensive measure against downside loss on a certain percentage of your portfolio versus cash/bonds.

For example I can think of JNJ of course.  It's largest drawdown was around -34% if I remember correctly and it's worst year was -10%.  It's averaged a 14% return since the 80s.

So I could see it or even MSFT etc as 'protecting' a certain percentage of my portfolio in the long term whilst also offering better than a 10% return hopefully.

I don't see JNJ or MSFT crashing and never recovering, but of course one can never say never.

I only invest in growth stocks which I have the opportunity to double my money within the next five years. I'm long term focused.

THREE STOCKS I AM BUYING RIGHT NOW

Corsair Gaming (CRSR)
-Corsair is currently trading at a forward PE ratio of under 20. Both top line and bottom line numbers have steadily increased and the gaming industry is growing. It has a dominant market share in the gaming and streaming business. This is one I am currently buying under $35 and the lower it goes, the more I am bullish.

Tattooed Chef (TTCF)
-Tattooed Chef is a smaller company which still has alot more room to grow. Many new deals have been announced. Examples include Walmart, Target, Costco, etc. Revenue is growing rapidly and profitability is beginning to rise. As the company announces new deals and new products, brand loyalty will begin to form and the long term success of the company could be massive with the company only being about ~1.5B.

Beyond Meat (BYND)
-Beyond Meat is rather expensive compared to its peers but at $130 and under, I find it very interesting. I love the CEO and the speed at which the company moves. Like TTCF, profitability is beginning to arise and the top line growth for BYND is MASSIVE! The company is currently focused on growing U.S. market share and global expansion. It may be expensive now but I think will be a BIG WINNER over the next decade.

For me, there are so many stocks I love and I think would be great investments. But, they are almost always very expensive. PE and PS ratios for pretty much any stock with a bright future are incredibly high.

What are you guys doing to find deals and compelling valuations for great growth stocks?"

If you want to invest in individual stocks, I would suggest to understand what you like ,do you want to invest in growth, and the risk and chances that come with it? Or do you want a mature company that does solid business but has limited room to grow. Understand the sectors that you are investing in. Some, like oil or chemicals are more cyclical than others, some rely heavily on a low interest environment, and so on. You get the idea. Then look at the company you like. How are the fundamentals and also: do you understand how they make their money, what can potentially influence their business and such.

2021-04-18 00:00:00,stocks,"Google uses ‚Äòdouble-Irish‚Äô to shift $75.4bn in profits out of Ireland [https://www.irishtimes.com/business/technology/google-used-double-irish-to-shift-75-4bn-in-profits-out-of-ireland-1.4540519](https://www.irishtimes.com/business/technology/google-used-double-irish-to-shift-75-4bn-in-profits-out-of-ireland-1.4540519)

&#x200B;

  

[Google](https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&tag_company=Google) shifted more than $75.4 billion (‚Ç¨63 billion) in profits out of the Republic using the controversial ‚Äúdouble-Irish‚Äù tax arrangement in 2019, the last year in which it used the loophole.

The technology giant availed of the tax arrangement to move the money out of Google [Ireland](https://www.irishtimes.com/news) Holdings Unlimited Company via interim dividends and other payments. This company was incorporated in Ireland but tax domiciled in [Bermuda](https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&tag_location=Bermuda) at the time of the transfer.

The move allowed Google Ireland Holdings to escape corporation tax both in the Republic and in the [United States](https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&tag_location=United+States) where its ultimate parent, Alphabet, is headquartered. The holding company reported a $13 billion pretax profit for 2019, which was effectively tax-free, the accounts show.

A year earlier, Google Ireland Holdings paid out dividends of ‚Ç¨23 billion, having recorded turnover of $25.7 billion.

Google has used the double Irish loophole to funnel billions in global profits through Ireland and on to Bermuda, effectively put them beyond the reach of US tax authorities.

Companies exploiting the double Irish put their intellectual property into an Irish-registered company that is controlled from a tax haven such as Bermuda. Ireland considers the company to be tax-resident in Bermuda, while the US considers it to be tax-resident here. The result is that when royalty payments are sent to the company, they go untaxed ‚Äì unless or until the money is eventually sent home to the US parent.

The ‚Äúdouble Irish‚Äù was abolished in 2015 for new companies establishing operations in the Republic. However, controversially, it allowed those already using it until the end of 2020 to phase it out.

Google overhauled its global tax structure and consolidated its intellectual property holdings back to the United States in early 2020, meaning 2019 was the final year in which it availed of the arrangement.

Up to late 2019, Google Ireland Holdings Unlimited Company was an intellectual property licensing company with turnover derived from the licensing of IP to subsidiaries. The accounts state it had no employees and that it was tax resident at the time in Bermuda, where the ‚Äústandard rate tax is 0 per cent‚Äù.

Commenting on the movement of the profits out of its Irish unit, a spokeswoman for Google said: ‚ÄúIn December 2019, in line with the OECD‚Äôs base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) conclusions and changes to US and Irish tax laws, we simplified our corporate structure and started licensing our IP from the US, not Bermuda. The accounts filed today cover the 2019 financial year, before we made those changes.

‚ÄúIncluding all annual and one-time income taxes over the past ten years, our global effective tax rate has been over 20 per cent, with more than 80 per cent of that tax due in the US,‚Äù she added.

The accounts state that Google Ireland Holdings Unlimited Company became tax resident in Ireland from January 1st, 2021, and that it now just operates as a holding company.

Turnover for the holding company rose from $25.7 billion in 2018 to $26.5 billion in 2019. The increase was primarily due to a rise in turnover recorded by the company‚Äôs subsidiaries, which results in higher royalty payments.

Dividend income from shares in group undertakings jumped from just $2.9 million in 2018 to $597.5 million a year later. The accounts also show a $3 billion increase in research and development costs in 2019, with the company incurring R&D expenses of $10.4 billion under a cost-sharing agreement with other Google entities globally.

Google Ireland, the tech company‚Äôs main operating Irish subsidiary with over 4,000 employees, recorded ‚Ç¨45.7 billion in revenues in 2019 with pretax profits amounting to ‚Ç¨1.94 billion. It paid ‚Ç¨263 million in tax that year, down nearly ‚Ç¨9 million versus 2018.

It is estimated that US multinationals were holding more than a $1 trillion in profits offshore via mechanisms such as the double Irish and the so-called Dutch sandwich by the end of 2017. Tax cuts introduced by former US president [Donald Trump](https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&tag_person=Donald+Trump) in 2019 have led to some of those profits being repatriated to the United States."

2021-04-18 08:36:57,stocks,"A couple of reasons I can think of:

1 - The basis for the Google search engine was funded by an NSF grant given to Stanford and in turn leveraged by the Google founders in their early research that built the primary foundation for selling ads.  US tax payers were the initial investors in Google- if this was done under VC terms ‚Äòwe‚Äô would own 50-75% of Google off that $4.5m grant...

2- Google benefits greatly from the US education system still- being arguably the most desired employer for top candidates out of US universities- many of which are heavily funded by taxes and grants.  Top students are also the most likely to obtain government scholarships and grants.

3- While Google is a global operation the majority of their primary innovations have happened in the US at US headquarters- it is their core innovation center. 

4- Outside of above, the largest grey area is also is this money ‚Äòtruly overseas revenue‚Äô.  I think it gets a bit more clear cut if they had a physical store in europe where products are purchased- but the bulk of their revenue is not this.  A website built in the us, on innovations funded by the us government, feasibly selling ads for us companies, to an EU citizen starts becoming a grey area to me on if it is truly ‚Äòoffshore revenue‚Äô.

I do agree that some revenue should be considered truly overseas, but if that is the case should it not be supporting those specific countries?  It is not- it is being loopholed into Ireland and Bermuda for the purpose of exploitation of the system.  Do you really believe that Bermuda has tens of billions of dollars coming from its citizens???

The bulk of EU citizens pay way more then us citizens in tax.  The bottom line is that corporations should be paying at least equivalent across the board- to the right countries for the right revenue.  Google is acting like their 20% global tax rate is ‚Äòfair‚Äô- when it is way less then a lot of us and eu citizens pay every year..."

You're making an emotional argument that the NSF helped some students 20 years ago so now 20k people all over the world needs to pay taxes in the US.
Also this doesn't apply to Yahoo, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple Facebook, Instagram and even Skype.

2- That's not exactly true Google benefits greatly from European, Indian and Chinese engineers, and US universities benefit from EU, Indian and Chinese educated students, with the US being a minority of exceptional achievers. This also is no ground for a company to pay taxes on foreign revenue, it's at best a case for why Google and others to maybe provide funding to US universities and grant money which I'm sure they do but in the end an employment contract pays for skills not for the education or social life.

3- Thus is purely speculation, and has little to do with their business model or cash flow in fact Google isn't exceptional in their research budget allocation as a percentage of their revenue. Google makes money not through their patents, nor through their innovation most of their products are open source. Their main product as it relates to man hours relates to services are around cloud service, and their cash flow relates to their selling of german ads written in german presented to german customers searching google maps for german stores (replace German with any country where google provides services).

4- That's the thing Google Instagram and most of these internet companies they do exist only on the internet and they do exist and earn in countries where they provide services, in fact due to EU law those customers aren't legally allowed to be served from the US not since Snowden.

There are a number of reasons these laws haven't been striken, such as priority legislation or the fact that the ""championing adultery"" label is not a good look.

My company makes sausage and spent 2.5 million on parts last year alone. $76 for a pin to hold a gripper on a chain 2"" long by 1/4 "" pin. $76 needed 200. No problem. üòÇ Maintenance and projects are expensive. People just think a bridge should cost the same as their driveway to build. Costs don't scale down on bigger projects they scale up.



The difference is that it's the owners who are losing money. Not tax payers. Your sausage producing corporation has to price goods to cover those maintenance and other costs to stay in business AND compete with other sausage producing corporations AND win enough customers to stay in business. Any money wasted is reduced profits into the owners pockets running the risk of being pushed out of the market by competitors who are better at allocating capital and managing resources. 

There is no competition for the government when it comes to competing for revenue or incentive for being efficient.. taxes are mandatory or they can borrow and not lose a dime of their own money because they don't produce or sell anything. Bids are handed off to cronies who have funded campaigns or have close connections.  The tax payer has no choice except to foot the bill. Hence the $4 billion 3 mile Mario Coumo bridge that was originally budgetted for $3 billion after destroying the existing Tappan Zee Bridge.

That's just because you don't consider the taxes they pay on behalf of their employees, nor do you take into consideration the continual expenses on R&D and business expansion, the sums there dwarf any individual taxpayer.

2021-04-18 16:27:54,stocks,"I'm well aware of the record of actively managed funds. I'm also aware that this record is deceiving when used as an argument against individual stock picking as it often is. There are many reasons that the majority of actively managed funds technically under-perform the S&P 500 and these are reasons that individual investors don't typically have to be concerned with.

First of all, not all actively managed funds have the goal of beating the S&P 500. Some of those funds have the goal of safe wealth preservation in any kind of market rather than growth that outperforms the S&P 500. Yet these funds still get included in that statistic of funds that failed to beat the S&P 500 even if that wasn't their goal.

Secondly, a reason that some funds fail to beat the S&P 500 is simply because of the fees associated with the fund which must be subtracted from their returns. After the fees are subtracted then they end up under-performing the S&P 500 and this gets reported in that statistic, but if you didn't have to subtract those fees then many more of these funds would have beat the S&P 500. People investing in individual stocks don't have to worry about these fees in most cases.

Plus, individual investors have an advantage over actively managed funds in that we can be much more nimble. An actively managed fund has to manage billions of dollars whereas an individual investor typically only has to manage thousands or a few millions of their own money.  That far smaller scale allows you to be much more nimble and move in and out of positions far easier than any actively managed fund could. Individual investors also have the privilege of investing in whatever we feel is best whenever we want; actively managed funds don't have that privilege and have to follow the fund rules which could place limitations on the investments that they can make even when they feel such investment would be best. Warren Buffett himself has said that it is a huge structural advantage to have less money and he would definitely be able to achieve far higher returns if he only had to manage a few millions rather than billions. Luckily for us individual investors that only manage thousands or a few millions, we can take advantage of that whereas the actively managed funds cannot which is yet another reason why that statistic about actively managed funds should not be used as an argument against individual stock picking. We are not on the same playing field and have some advantages over them."
2021-04-18 07:02:22,stocks,"He lived for 90 years, he pretty much said so much you could construct any argument out of it.

And on top of that, why wouldn't he say it ? He is talking to people that think smart investing is quoting Warren Buffet and another group of people that bought Palantir, BlackBerry, Nio, GME right at the top and are bleeding a new asshole at the moment.

Anyone with a little bit of time could manage their own version of  S&P 500 without the dog shit and zombie companies that are currently in it, make your portfolio towards the stocks that tend to outperform the market and leave out the ones that will definitely underperform it. Or people could pick a better index fund and better ETFs.

If the interest in stock market is there, doesn't have to be individual stock picking, anyone can put at least a better effort than just straight up buying S&P 500

2021-04-18 15:32:07,stocks,"Right. I never said all ETFs were Index Funds. To clarify, my split above is for my actively managed cash portfolio. My retirement accounts (401k, IRAs) are all index funds (Fidelity Large Cap,Vanguard S&P 500, SPDR S&P 500, iShares Core) that are set and forget except for rebalancing once a year. So I was comparing the avg return on my active portfolio vs those index funds.

I think The main challenge for the average investor is being diversified, which why I value ETFs for a large chuck of my investment portfolio. 

Concentrated positions generally carry a high risk/reward ratio.  So it really depends on what your goal is and where one is in life. 

 I am ahead of where I wanted to be so my goal is less about making a killing and more about not screwing it up.

Very few people have the time and skill set to follow more than dozen stocks closely.

That said, if you know what you are doing ETFs, especially sector ETFs, are dumb.  I regularly best the utility and MLP indexes with my own picks, but I have followed those sectors  for years.  But even my good MLPs suffered vs the s&p lately."

2021-04-18 16:04:53,stocks,"I think you are probably right, but then I get stuck.

presumably if I purchased and rebalanced the right number of stocks I could mimic the S&P 500. Which means I would neither beat or lose to the market.

If I did the same but didn‚Äôt purchase just one company. The worse of the worse then wouldn‚Äôt I beat the market? Just one bad company. So, apparently we not only say, you can‚Äôt beat the market... you can‚Äôt even identify a one dog? That‚Äôs hard to believe.

We have said for generations, ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt consistently beat the market‚Äù but many many do. Apparently the rule is you can‚Äôt beat the market... unless you do.

I‚Äôve beat the market most years but not all. If I take the last 20 years I‚Äôve made more than 10% compounded annually. Does that mean I‚Äôm smarter than the 99% or am I due a comeuppance?

It seams that most of the market is organized to beat the market. Leverage and options are attempts at beating the market. Is it really a fools errand?

The first mutual fund was in 1924. Before that almost nobody could afford to buy a representation of the market. Does that mean everyone was losing in the long run before 1924?

As I‚Äôve said earlier, maybe fund managers can‚Äôt consistently beat the market but they have constraints a retail investor doesn‚Äôt contend with. Their performance is easy to measure but how would we even have a guess as to retail investors.

The Amsterdam Stock Exchange was formed in 1602. And I would have suspected that a Darwinian process would have taken all the money from the stock pickers and options players and given it to he index players. Yet the rich seem more involved with options, stock picker and even hedge funds. 

I‚Äôve either convinced myself that I‚Äôm a financial genius, or that I‚Äôm about to lose it all, or more likely, it‚Äôs easier for a retail investor to consistently beat the market then I may have believed."

2021-04-18 12:34:16,stocks,"AAPL - For obvious reasons already listed here, diversified revenue and the stock price isn‚Äôt insanely overvalued(ie tesla) despite having some speculative new markets emerging. 

AMD- I‚Äôve been bullish on them taking share from their strong competition with Lisa Su at the helm, I like their shot at becoming a $100+ and beyond. Extremely undervalued considering they bought xilinx($120 stock) to compete in the data center space. All of the new gaming consoles have AMD chips in them which is a testament to their performance.  

BABA- The AMZN of China, China‚Äôs middle class will continue to grow and grow in the coming years. China won‚Äôt mess with their giant in any real significant way, the commies still love money. 

LYFT- Short term I can see people hesitate over their business model relying on gig workers or whatever, but for me this would be a 5 year play on increasing demand for micro-mobility(any trip from 1-3 miles or under). Living in any city you realize that parking is just going to keep becoming more and more of a nightmare. People want to use their cars less, and nightlife/traveling will return. Lyft has some partnerships I am excited about: Google‚Äôs Waymo self driving project, and they bought Motivate which does E-Bikes. The lyft bikes have an infrastructure(charging stations) monopoly in my city and they‚Äôre exploding in popularity. This is probably my most pure speculation play while still having the safety net of being a well known brand. 

TGT- I haven‚Äôt bought any stocks in the purely retail space yet but maybe next week. I just love Target. Great company, I have had nothing but fantastic experiences buying everything here throughout the pandemic. They are affordable without just selling cheap garbage. They also grow sales year over year way more quickly than most in this space."

BMY - Strong pipeline + Celgene acquisition diversifies their revenue streams, also trading at a reasonably cheap valuation

LMT - Military budget should remain stable regardless of which party controls the federal government, long-dated service contracts for platforms like F-35, also a play on space

UNH - Top 3 position in each of major health insurance markets: Commercial, Medicare Advantage (MA), and Medicaid. Any major changes to the current healthcare system would take years to execute and UNH would probably play a role in that transformation.

V - Continued digitization of financial system, pandemic recovery should be favorable to them, they also appear to be experimenting with crypto transactions for customers

TSCO - Not quite as established as something like HD/LOW in terms of retail but higher upside potential, should be pretty resilient to e-commerce given the products they sell + their targeted market"

2021-04-17 20:13:37,stocks,Agreed. Most stocks are overpriced these days. Starbucks pe is 200. Costco pe is relatively alright but it‚Äôs on its highest since the dip. Dis is not making money. The tech usuals have pe around the high 30s. In this market it is nothing but it will still hurt when there is a correction. Baba: why are we investing in a company that China might kill off or jail the ceo? Lmt has good pe but might be a value trap same w intel.

2021-04-17 22:14:35,stocks,Yeah it still has catching up to do with other similar companies. I think it‚Äôs been undervalued because Americans tend to be more skeptical of Chinese companies.

2021-04-17 20:07:04,stocks,"Oh cool I can run an extension cord down 4 flights of stairs across a parking lot/road and allow it to be run over my bikes, cars, children, pissed on by dogs, and then get a fine from my complex for the pleasure.

That is obviously not an ideal solution for everyone, in fact MOST PEOPLE. Did the idea of the possibility of fines for creating an unsightly obstruction and a fall hazard even occur to you? Or the fact that some people‚Äôs assigned spots are not directly in front of their building? Like even if you did have a 400 foot extension cord and converted one of your interior 12V outlets to the 120/240A required, it would be absolutely ridiculous, your neighbors would hate you, and you would without a doubt get a fine for the intrusion on other people‚Äôs ability to traverse stairs, the lawn, or the sidewalk. It would also become severely damaged incredibly quickly after being trod on, run over, pissed on, and played with by negligent children with no supervision.

Without a charging station at the parking spot, plug based electric vehicles are unrealistic for apartments, period. I have seen complexes that offer charge stations but they have two. The most I‚Äôve seen is a brand new build and it has 8. And often times well over a THOUSAND UNITS are rented out. If even 0.01% of those people have electric/plug-in hybrid vehicles, there is a 20-80% chance you don‚Äôt get to charge your car that night. It‚Äôs totally unrealistic unless it becomes required infrastructure on at least half of the spots offered in all new builds and required renovation in older properties.

So either way, that lags severely behind the growth of EV‚Äôs in the next 10 years. You‚Äôre talking about outfitting 20 million parking spots with charge stations. At an extremely conservative estimate of $500 per station for install, that would cost $100,000,000,000 and would outnumber charging stations nationwide by a factor of 50. It‚Äôs completely unrealistic.

Until a major US manufacturer begins doing what NIO does and offers battery swapping and building the infrastructure, 40 million (and growing) customers will be off the table permanently for EV manufacturers. Or I guess over the air charging or charge pads (like WAVE) at stop lights."

But to say that in 5 years it can‚Äôt grow and would actually go down 90%!? Well, they would have to have some major collapse for that to happen. I think you are looking at today‚Äôs numbers and not beyond it. I think you are looking at roku as a streaming service and not as a monopoly on smart TVs.

But, in case this is good faith I will spell out my reply since you seem incapable of parsing it.

You said:
> We are in the biggest bull run ever, more retail investors joining now than ever before, and what goes up must come down.

I replied with:
> We've been on a bull run for a little more than a year, definitely not the longest bull run ever.

Granted, by biggest I assumed you meant longest because ""biggest bull run"" is kind of a meaningless term, because of the way the stock market works the most recent bull run is almost always the ""biggest"" if you're defining the ""size"" of bull runs by the amount of money being made or the amount of money going in.

you said:
>Idk why everyone is saying there won‚Äôt be a crash?

I replied with:
> People arent saying there will never be a crash, people are saying that predictions of exactly when that crash will be have been very wrong, and if you try to time it and get it wrong you miss out on a ton of gains.

Because I haven't seen a single person in these comments or elsewhere say ""There won't be a crash"", I've only seen them say ""Ok bro but people predict crashes like every other week so I'm just gonna ignore this because none of us know when it's gonna happen"""

NVDA risk is they lose the ARM deal, but that has no effect on their roadmap, and the risk is baked in, and given they're overpaying, it was a wash anyway. I think they add some paperwork promising to keep core dev independent and accessible to all, and it goes through.

2021-04-17 21:32:28,stocks,"Most will not beat the indices but a small percentage do. This has and will likely always be a debate, of which using hedge funds / institutions as evidence to the contrary is a poor justification since they have different directives (diversification, preservation). Not to mention fees from active management / turnover. 

I do however agree that most if not everyone should have a base - call it the pizza dough to your homemade pizza - of the VTI type funds."
2021-04-17 21:43:36,stocks,"I‚Äôm not sure your point about poor justification inspires confidence to try and be a part of that extremely small percentage. Not to mention people don‚Äôt invest in hedge funds to just tread water and ‚Äúpreserve‚Äù their wealth. For that fee I‚Äôd hope they‚Äôd give me a good return, right? 

My point of using institutions and funds is to point out that even the ‚Äúmost qualified‚Äù individuals have a hard time beating the passive market. And they have access to quicker information than we do and more sophisticated tools. We compete against those people in every transaction and so while I may not think they‚Äôre special, I know I‚Äôm not special either. So I‚Äôll just hold the market happily."
2021-04-17 22:22:54,stocks,"How do they have access to tools that you don't when you're a buy and hold investor? *They* are at a disadvantage to the individual investor (not trader) because they, as I mentioned, have different goals and strategies for their clients. They have to sing and dance like puppets while we can hold steady or make changes that their clients would not approve of as a whole. 

And no, they aren't there to beat the SP500. If they were why would they still exist and have inflows? Many wealthy clients demand capital preservation that exceeds a zero risk return. They want it to grow but also not lose it. This implies they won't beat the market because they're not willing to incur the risk premium. 

There isn't enough empirical data to prove or disprove whether retail investors can beat the market. My underlying point is you need to compare apples to apples, which this argument cannot do. I'm willing to concede it is the theoretically possible in the long term retail investors will not outperform the market if there's data to support it. I however draw a hard line with using any data between institutional and retail investors as a basis for supporting your argument. 

It's true you're likely to come out ahead in the long term with a bogleheads-like portfolio. I'm not denying that. 

As a former professional poker player I've come across many people more intelligent than I who unfortunately lacked emotional IQ and would do well until they didn't and go on tilt and lose chunks of profit. Our emotions are our own worst enemy and I think it's important to understand we're all susceptible. Those that don't believe that are most at risk of doing stupid shit at the worst times. 

I personally believe it comes down to humility and having awareness that we are emotional creatures. We're hardwired to expect immediate reward for good behavior/decisions and punishment for poor. 

Investing is a lot like poker in that you have to acknowledge and look past your engrained limitations and look for ways to gain maximum value. By in large if you ask me it's finding a sweet spot between time horizon, risk tolerance and sticking with a buy and hold strategy. Also equally important to humble yourself and be willing to take in new information and question your strategies. 

Bottom line, I think it's possible to beat the market but it doesn't mean it's easy nor a fully passive strategy. I personally enjoy it as do many others so I'm sure there's a premium attached there as well."

It's why I personally would never trade stocks. You could be the most brilliant person in the world and I'm not convinced you wouldn't constantly second guess results and your strategies since it can take years for results to align with your expectations. Que human emotions. 

Might sound ironic but reducing the frequency of my decision making is in my opinion key. I'm just slightly outside of going full index as I believe there's added value to be had.

If you look at this, there aren't many dates on that chart where you can baseline them and not have the margin interest increase higher than the market value increase up to now.

Margin interest is high in both absolute and relative terms, or I'd be there disabusing people of worrying about it, too. The massive jump in the past year means valuations are likely to be very inflated relative to fundamental value, too.

The Fed already allowed the supplemental leverage ratio (SLR) exemption to expire. That's why the banks spent this week selling billions of dollars in bonds. They were getting cash to get their SLR back up to the standard values. They still haven't been told that they have to get back up to normal deposit ratios. But I think they've actually been doing that by raising lending rates, which has been lowering treasury bond prices (raising yields) since last summer. The increased rates created cash flow that I think they've been stashing in the vault so they'll be ready when the reserve requirement is out in place again.

They present the numbers the other way around (50% and 30% margin), but what they're doing is over-collateralizing on open and pulling the trigger early to close.

And they charge you interest the entire time they're taking nearly 0 risk on you. The only thing that can really hurt them is if your wizard pick tanks by another 21% while they're waiting for you to meet the call. But they can usually see that coming and increase the minimum to give themselves more margin for error."

Large scale production will require rail or pipeline which would take another 3+ years. However, it seems like Namibia has several advantages over Uganda. For one, it has a relatively good regulatory environment for foreign companies (mining is already 15% of it's GDP) to limit some of the rent seeking. It's also not landlocked, so has full say over whether to build a pipeline to Walvis Bay.

Why are high rates/low prices better than low rates/high prices if your monthly payment ends up being the same?

a) Mortgage interest is deductible, principle is not.  For the same monthly payment there's tax benefits to paying more interest.

b) Capital gains on sale.  Use to be 250k  for primary residence would make almost all house gains tax free.  When houses are 1 million+ in some parts of the country, that's not necessarily true.

c) Lot of costs scale almost linearly with the cost of the property, not the monthly carrying cost.  Title insurance, home insurance, real estate commissions, property taxes (to a lesser extent if everyone else's property goes up equally), etc.

d)  Need a larger down payment (which is harder to save up because savings accounts pay nothing in low rate times).

e) Harder to pay off earlier because your loan amount is more.

2021-04-18 08:44:37,stocks," Question about dropping share price and SPAC's financial health...

I know that SPACs (especially EV companies) have turned into a bit of a joke recently. There were quite a few overvalued duds. Regardless, I found one that I have serious long-term conviction about. For context, its the only SPAC and the only EV company that I've bought. Its about %1 of my portfolio. Like all EV companies, the share price has tanked recently. I wasn't concerned though. On Friday, the stock plummeted (\~10%) before the ex-redemption date to around $9 per share. I'm a little bit concerned now though. The merger is set for April 21st. If I knew everything would go through, I would absolutely be buying more shares, but SPACs are fairly unfamiliar for me.

What are the potential financial hang-ups that could wreck a SPAC?

For context, the company is Lightening eMotors (GIK). I'm happy to discuss why I like the company if people are interested, but that really isn't the point of this post."

Taking the five tendies and the two quarters and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke the tendies.

I like them because they've got a steady, reliable business and already have established points of sale all over the country.  In their investor presentation they showed how sales of their rolling papers and other accessories (hemp wraps, etc.) increase substantially n states that legalize, a trend which is sure to continue.

2021-04-18 06:38:01,stocks,"> I know hype rarely affects stock prices

Hype is one of the main drivers of stock price, more so for growth and speculative stock. Investor expectation of a new product, growth potential, a new C-level appointment, whispers of an earning beat, etc. will all increase hype and expectation and that drives demand for a stock. Share prices are based on supply vs demand. The more demand the higher the price.

Of course hype eventually needs to be backed up by fundamentals otherwise the hype dies down and the share price follows in the same direction.

Apple entering the EV market has been long rumoured, dating back to 10-15 years however in the past year they have been more vocal about agreeing a partnership and producing an Apple car. Due to this we probably wont see an explosive movement to the upside as this will be mostly 'priced in'. Depending on the details of the deal we could see a bump in share price based in potential for growth however, if the deal puts is seen as unfavourable i.e. will tie up a lot of cash and resources on Apple's end it might be a 'sell the news' event.

With Apple expectations are always high, a lot of the time when they release a new product people are whelmed in comparison to the pre-launch hype.

tl;dr

It depends on the details of the deal and how the street reacts to it"
