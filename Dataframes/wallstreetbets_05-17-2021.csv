2021-05-17 19:54:00,wallstreetbets,You can always just apply to be a wifey boyfriend. Usually they don’t come to your house and guys like me end up footing the hotel bill.

Send Ricky some money so when this trade goes tits up she still gives me the time of day"
2021-05-17 19:52:30,wallstreetbets,It's good to set goals. I bet your hoes would enjoy a dog food bowl of coke.

2021-05-17 19:12:35,wallstreetbets,May the tendies be with you.
2021-05-17 19:11:08,wallstreetbets,Almost the same … need 10.45 to break even and 15 contracts
2021-05-17 19:06:07,wallstreetbets,This is definitely all Cum and all Cock! Good job man
2021-05-17 19:08:53,wallstreetbets,Why wouldn't you just buy the 10k shares? You could collect the dividend and not be on a timetable or throwing away 10% of the gain.
2021-05-17 19:55:37,wallstreetbets,We need more people like you. This is why I come to this sub. 😂😂
2021-05-17 19:05:10,wallstreetbets,Wrong MC. Supposed to be AMC.  You’d be making bank right now. Ultimate retard ^
2021-05-17 19:34:08,wallstreetbets,Why?  🤔
2021-05-17 19:14:11,wallstreetbets,Because 80k vs 10k
2021-05-17 19:14:11,wallstreetbets,Sometimes you want to be able to leverage your trade or you don’t want to hold onto the shares but you believe in the direction the stock is heading.
2021-05-17 19:07:17,wallstreetbets,How clever are you? alpha retard^
2021-05-17 19:18:56,wallstreetbets,So? This is a Yolo right?
2021-05-17 19:22:54,wallstreetbets,"I understand,  but you also have to be situational. In this case the valuation to margin of safety on downside and dividend yield, plus the premium cost leaves much on the table."
2021-05-17 19:35:05,wallstreetbets,You gonna lend him the $ to yolo $80k?
2021-05-17 19:24:36,wallstreetbets,What’s the “margin of safety”? He’s a guy buying OTM calls.
2021-05-17 19:36:09,wallstreetbets,Are you claiming he's too poor?
2021-05-17 19:25:19,wallstreetbets,I am referring to him taking a long position instead. He wouldn't be throwing away money
2021-05-17 19:39:22,wallstreetbets,"No. He posted a 10k yolo, so I’m taking his word for it and not assuming he has another $70k to yolo."
2021-05-17 19:31:58,wallstreetbets,But I can't make 1000% in a week if I just hold shares.
2021-05-17 19:26:30,wallstreetbets,"Sir, this is a casino."
2021-05-17 19:43:28,wallstreetbets,"In all fairness,  I wouldn't expect him to post a headline 80k Yolo with a 10k options contract...... I'm just fucking around at this point"
2021-05-17 18:37:17,wallstreetbets,This is the kinda thing I’d like to be good at

2021-05-17 19:07:44,wallstreetbets,You are absolutely right. That’s why I ran so fast. Papa Musk is my hero. Hopefully he didn’t mind I took a quick bite. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|money_face)

2021-05-17 18:25:14,wallstreetbets,It would not be great if Netflix took over movie theaters. Have you seen some of the crap on there?
2021-05-17 18:29:34,wallstreetbets,All I’m thinking about is AMC after hours right now 🚀
2021-05-17 18:22:29,wallstreetbets,What the efff
2021-05-17 19:05:19,wallstreetbets,Someday soon AMC will pop like GME up to $400. Let’s rock to the moon.
2021-05-17 18:30:16,wallstreetbets,Damn I didn't even know dvd's still existed

2021-05-17 19:50:16,wallstreetbets,WTF are you even talking about? Get the MAYO out of your pocket
2021-05-17 18:34:05,wallstreetbets,"How much weed do you smoke? 

Microsoft, Sony, Steam and Nintendo own the gaming market in terms of selling and marketing online video games. Xbox, Good luck for Netflix to even think of competing in that market space. 

All major competitors own their own gaming platforms, or dominate their own platform of sale. Anyone else pays them a fee price to use their platform. 

Is Netflix going to acquire GameStop at a ludicrous share price for its actual fundamentals, then develop its own console, then encourage developers to create games on its platform while selling other platforms at their physical locations? The answer here is extremely unlikely for the yes column."
2021-05-17 19:08:07,wallstreetbets,"The original CEO of blockbuster has even said however that Netflix isn’t the real reason blockbuster went out of business. A lot of people believe this but there were a lot of different factors that led blockbuster to its demise. So I’m not really sure how Netflix could be attacking GME. I could see AMC more than GME. However, this is my own speculation and opinion, not advice of any kind. Correct me if I am wrong."
2021-05-17 19:17:48,wallstreetbets,Netflix? Lol ...IT IS CLEARLY AMAZON. Major competitor with Amazon video AND retail sales. . And bezos stepped down during all of this in Feb...think about it 🤣💎🙌🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
2021-05-17 18:18:17,wallstreetbets,🤯
2021-05-17 18:51:18,wallstreetbets,"Charlie connecting the dots here. Why not go after Gamefly? If they are going for that market?

It also leave alot of room for Cinemark or Regal to feast on AMCs bones. Theatres are large structures with alot of specific infrastructure and cant really be parlayed into alot of other industries. I have to imagine someone wants those assets."

2021-05-17 19:57:56,wallstreetbets,This is better than last weeks Law and Order
2021-05-17 18:46:15,wallstreetbets,The whole cannabis sector is being shorted. ACB is almost like AMC and GME.
2021-05-17 18:34:02,wallstreetbets,Move over Batman this guy is the worlds greatest detective now
2021-05-17 19:29:22,wallstreetbets,"IMO..Netflix taking over GME/AMC I don't see it, but what I do see is Amazon trying to and doing so in a way that they both will still exist as they do today as a walkin business but also be added to their platform for purchase, which I don't think would be a bad idea,"
2021-05-17 19:36:07,wallstreetbets,I took a blue pill and realized that I’m unstoppable

2021-05-17 18:48:22,wallstreetbets,"Cuties being one of the dumpster fires.. they lost 800% in subscriptions after that.

But [Rich Greenfield ](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/04/21/dont-get-too-caught-up-in-netflix-q1-subscriber-numbers-lightsheds-greenfield.html)
says pay it no mind."
2021-05-17 18:56:17,wallstreetbets,"In 2011 they spit their company into two different sectors streaming and mail in service. 

They announced it in an [Public Apology Video ](https://youtu.be/7tWK0tW1fig) after they raised their rates 60% and lost over 800,000 subscribers. 

Note how it was more of a prospectus than an apology

But yeah.. the mail out section still brings in a decent amount of capitol.. would be nice to grow that sector yea?"
2021-05-17 18:48:55,wallstreetbets,I’m flairing it as shitpost anyway.  This shit is kind of funny.

2021-05-17 19:53:28,wallstreetbets,"“Interactive titles are a fun way to experience Netflix. In each title, you make choices for the characters, shaping the story as you go. Each choice leads to a different adventure, so you can watch again and again, and see a new story each time.”

2021-05-17 18:41:31,wallstreetbets,"This was Netflix’s game plan pre squeeze levels. 

But they failed miserably.   

Who has such a vested interest in Netflix.. who shorted GME and AME and took over when citron went under.. 

There is your connection"
2021-05-17 19:14:57,wallstreetbets,"You’re right but Netflix saw this and capitalized on it. 
Blockbuster tried to fight back by changing with the times and doing online mail out dvd’s and they battled for years over it. Netflix delivered the crippling blow to an already weak block buster buy dropping their subscription service from $17.99 to $4.99. 

An already weak and heavily shorted Block Buster couldn’t compete and was forced to close. 

Sounds similar to pre squeeze levels on gme and amc"
2021-05-17 19:25:31,wallstreetbets,"Citadel owns $4.7B in Netflix and is shorting both stocks heavily. 

Amazon might have a hand but I haven’t went down that path."

2021-05-17 19:06:15,wallstreetbets,"Ohh no? 

Netflix still has a mail in service for dvd’s. You don’t think they have the capitol to start mailing out videogames once GME was decapitated?"
2021-05-17 19:21:39,wallstreetbets,"They had a whole bunch of tactics lowering their prices to less than amazon.. rewards programs ect. 

At the time they went under had 40M subscribers to their online movie service. (Fairly significant) 

Check out NFLX stock price in 2010 when this happened"

2021-05-17 18:53:56,wallstreetbets,Took the slightly conservative route with 6/18 $12 calls
2021-05-17 18:34:19,wallstreetbets,"They went up significantly for WeBull (To 170% as far as I was told). Apparantly, the Ortex Rate is still high. Please also note that there were 400-450k Shares to borrow on IBKR, and only 45k (Last i checked) has been returned. That leaves 350-400k borrowed which is still the vast majority. 

My guess, is they are actually doing Due Diligence of their own and have realized we've been bandying around the IBKR numbers, so their trying to mask their movement a little. With that said, at the end of the day only 45-50k has been been returned to IBKR leaving a very significant amount left over. They haven't really begun to cover.

Finally, if you're going to sell your shares, and are cognizant of the gamma squeeze for the love of god sell deep ITM covered calls instead. Gets you out with guaranteed profit (and ekes you an extra percentage point or two), while simultaneously not hurting the upward momentum of the stock for Friday since the Market Makers will need to hedge before it ends above 9."

With that said, if you want to buy a stock, but at a bit lower price, sell puts on it. If you want to generate additional income and are wiling to sell at a certain price sell covered calls. Those are the 2 easiest ones for newbies, because they generate you cash on things you already were going to do, or were willing to do."

2021-05-17 19:25:36,wallstreetbets,"Just being straight up with you- if you’re a beginner, don’t go fucking with options until you’ve really read a bunch. Then buy 1 or two cheap ones and see if they’ll print based on your thesis. Expand from there if successful. You will lose money if you just start buying them. 
(Buy UWMC shares, which will limit your potential losses to less than 100% of your investment)"

2021-05-17 19:53:21,wallstreetbets,"Yes, that's the one.

Edit: and as the reply there stated, you just need to get an actual known figure to endorse it, such as RoaringKitty, to get the clout necessary to convince wsb retail.

There is high uncertainty with it right now. I think things look positive, but there is speculation of whether their cash runway will be enough for marketing + production ramp up or whether they'll have to do another offering. I think that uncertainty is mostly why the price fell despite the approval. 

It's a great time to buy if you're confident in the product and are willing to hold another 6+ months. It's not so great of a time to buy unless enough buying happens to swung the momentum against the shorts + bring back confidence."

screened sand, or various other special sands, and those you will pay out the ass for. But again, youre mostly paying for processing it.

It's not a short squeeze, because it would make no sense for a short squeeze to start at 6:50 and rally the price artificially in a low-volume environment. That's an awful strategy to close shorts.

There's also a *massive* sell wall that keeps moving up in price.

Citadel added more puts.  They are currently holding \~$2 billion in AMD puts.

Everyone here is fawning over the prospects for GME and AMC, when the real play is AMD because 1) It is legitimately backed by hundreds of reputable funds.  2) It is a sound business that is growing like crazy.

You have already been given the proof when Robinhood halted buying on AMD.  Why did they do this?  AMD was not even on the radar like GME when they did it.  They do not want you buying AMD.  AMD is their true Achilles heel.  Citadel is currently stuck in a short position there that makes zero sense!

Yes, I'm a total newb when it comes to buying stocks....I literally opened up an Ameritrade account JUST to buy some AMC because I had \*faith\* that when all this pandemic crap was over, people would flock back to the movies and I wanted to get in on making a little $$$.  I didn't have a A LOT to invest but I thought it would be a good introduction into the stock market for me.  

That being said... 

I feel like the people hatin' aren't actual lovers of going OUT to the movies. Back before the plague, I used to go to the movies at least once a week (maybe twice on weekends). I don't buy into the whole ""people will decide it's better to watch movies at home"". Bullshit, if you LOVE seeing a movie in a theater environment...you will continue to do so. I just got my 2nd shot of Pfizer on Saturday and one of the first things I'm going to do in 2 weeks is GO TO THE FUCKING MOVIES! ....and I'll damn sure make sure it's an AMC. lol.  \*Side note, I live in Los Angeles...and with Pacific Theaters and the Arclight closing up shop (\*sigh\*)....not much left but AMC and maybe a few small independently owned theaters (which I support, as well because I LOVE GOING TO THE MOVIES).  

\*\*\*I'd just like to add that I've been a daily reader of wallstreetbets since I placed my first order for AMC on February 1st....and I'd like to thank you people for all the laughs.  Ya'll are some funny mother f\*\*kers.  I think I've actually learned a little, too.  Who knew?  

Anyways, it's a honor to make and (more often) lose money, with all you fine folk.  Carry on with your bad selves.   :)"

2021-05-17 19:38:26,wallstreetbets,I would highly reccomend waiting to see if it squeezes over 20 before buying a put with how high the implied volatility on it is right now even a major drop in share price may not be that profitable due to the IV crush that would likely come along with it. I plan to buy a few k in $20 strike puts if it gets to 24+ this week likely June 18 expirys otherwise I’ll be staying away from amc it’s way too unpredictable for me

Even those windmills need oil products to keep 'em lubed, just like the assholes behind Wendy's and their lube. Edit: And every internal combustion engine needs oil and gas, and that's about 97% of all vehicles. Edit: And JB admin has a war on oil. High demand, supply squeezed too; But OPEC actually has the world by the balls. If they decide to increase supply significantly oil bulls are fuk. But I think that may not happen in very near future. Better check next OPEC+ meeting date."
2021-05-17 19:51:43,wallstreetbets,"Demand increase, supply increase will be slower as OPEC+ try not to overdo supply, US small firms can’t borrow money, bigger companies try to reduce CO2 with bullshit schemes of CCS or fuel from algae, all funded by tax payers. Could go up a bit, there’s a cap if it gets too high, there will be another boom, oversupply and the price goes down and shale investors lose money again."

2021-05-17 17:48:58,wallstreetbets,you have to separate your love for the movies from recognizing a good company. Literally the thing i miss most from the pre pandemic times was good movies in a movie theater. But AMC was dying and nearly bankrupt before the pandemic. It's a shit company. And I love going to their theaters. There's a huge difference.

[It was a direct listing.](https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-announces-proposed-direct-listing-3a52c4298ccc) Direct listings are considerably more risky as they have no lockup period. [I'd recommend giving this a read](https://www.investopedia.com/investing/difference-between-ipo-and-direct-listing/) and avoiding direct listings until you understand the risks involved.

2021-05-17 17:24:22,wallstreetbets,"Since we don't know whether off-worlders want to exploit humans/earth as a resource, as an anthropological study (think South American indians) or to welcome us to the universe in their version of a third (4th, 5th) world country is purely speculative.  Any technology they show us would be the equivalent of magic in our eyes. Like showing a 13th century knight a surface to air missle or a monk working on moveable type an iphone. It might take generations to understand it.

Some talking points: 

1) If they don't want to eat us (there are easier ways to create protein than catching and processing a meat sack) but want to exploit resources, then perhaps they want to trade, buy extractive industries (mining, heavy equipment).

2) If they don't have the concept of trade, and only take by force, then we're toast anyway. Buy bugout gear and live off the grid for as long as you can. Patriot Supply and Readywise are not publicly traded, but Coleman is as part of Newell Brands (NWL) and just had a stock split. Any of the gun manufacturers would likely do well, IF they were publicly traded. Only Ruger (RGR and Colt (Olin mnfg OLN) will do you any good before the market tanks due to the aforementioned bugout.

3) If they are just studying us, and had an equivalent of a NSF grant to study indigenous species, and stupidly left some equipment behind, then, by all means, find out if Lockhead-Martin, GE, SpaceX etc, got access to it and quietly invest. If the DOD got the item first, go Lockhead-Martin or General Dynamics. Otherwise, if the item was IT related, especially storage, NVIDIA, Intel, etc. If it was communications, maybe a SPAC like FIVG, or Raytheon.

4) If they turn out to be benevolent, and want us as a ""partner"" of some sort, then we go with the space tech and extractive models. a) Extracting elements from asteroids is substantially cheaper once you are out there, but you have to get people, resources, support and some medium of exchange out there. Buy SPCX, since Musk has the vision. b) You also will need a bunch of new psychiatrists since this won't be easy for anyone to deal with. c) Designers for all the alien themed clothing, cars and tchotchkes that will emerge. d) engineers and mathematicians to make sure space vehicles don't end up in the sun.  

Thanks for reading this far into the endless drivel. 

TL: DR

If we're not food or slaves, then buy rockets.

Good luck."

I'd definitely go with Lockheed Martin, the 'Skunkworks' division probably has already built the new craft as the former director of that program, Steve Justice, publicly retired from that position for the purpose of joining 'To the Stars Academy' (https://home.tothestarsacademy.com/) and they are currently still doing a private equity offering I believe. The academy's purpose is to build the new craft and they have already partnered with the Army and quite a few other highly legitimate personalities and organizations.


Edit: looks like Steve just joined Virgin to give the goods there: https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephen-justice-731901

2021-05-17 16:33:34,wallstreetbets,"I imagine tech stocks may be key. If they've been holding back information until now, there may be some technology that may be contracted out to existing and reputable bleeding-edge private companies (Nokia, Intel, ARM to name a few that come to mind). However, if the contracts are given out to companies that you didn't invest in, or to no privately owned companies, yours may suffer in value, so be aware of potential risks imo.

Is there any other company doing FSD for the masses? Reusable spacecraft for planetary colonization?

Burry's DD is like ""nope just another car company that happened to get too big"". i believe he's in for quite the surprise."
2021-05-17 16:59:37,wallstreetbets,Yeah. He did bet against Wall Street. Both in the housing crisis and with GameStop. Elon musk is just really good at getting scientists and engineers to make things and raising money for things most people are afraid of. Tesla is a car company that has far too high of a market cap and not even close to enough sales to justify it.
2021-05-17 17:02:00,wallstreetbets,I mean Burry's only big fame is Big Short against Mortgage Securities and having over a million shares of GME long before it skyrocketed.

2021-05-17 17:06:00,wallstreetbets,"Ok, I took a math class once so maybe this is wrong, but...

The 13f says that the TSLA puts represent 40% of his portfolio (!!!). Scion has ~$639M AUM, so $639M * 40% = $255M (value of the position). If he has 8,000 contracts that means he paid ~$32k per contract (or that’s what they’re currently worth). So we’re likely looking at long-dated, ITM puts.

Edit: June ‘23 $750p for instance."
2021-05-17 18:45:38,wallstreetbets,Elon Musk gonna tweet that Burry isn’t allowed to go to Mars via SpaceX or something

2021-05-17 18:44:26,wallstreetbets,"I don't understand the hate on Burry in here.

Is it just because of TSLA cult?

Burry was right and went hard on the y2k .com bubble.

Burry was right in 2008 and went hard, super yolo.

Burry is a legitimate Autist (though, Musk is too LUL)

Burry was the original GME Long...the dude exited before others because he had to take profit for his fund.  With the large amount of money he had invested, he knew a downturn could be swift and he could have a hard time exiting (he could get sell locked).  Investing your own money is different than investing other people's money....he still made a 5X play.

Burry is a genius and a truth-speaker.

Between the two, I would never bet against Burry.  Unlike the other ""doom sayers"" the guy is right when he points something out, and he isn't just a doom and gloomer..he goes long in good companies."

2021-05-17 18:26:31,wallstreetbets,It’s not a 530 million dollar bet.  The value of the shares in the underlying put contracts are valued at 530 million.  Typical CNBC reporting.  His position is probably worth less than 100M and doesn’t effect float because they are options.

2021-05-17 19:58:47,wallstreetbets,500m in shorts gives new meaning to buy the dip…
2021-05-17 14:49:48,wallstreetbets,Shorting hedggies are evil!!!! The banks were right in ‘08! This must be stopped to protect the retail investors!
2021-05-17 15:11:03,wallstreetbets,How is this not a short squeeze waiting to happen? the MMs would have short sold 80M worth of shares to hedge.
2021-05-17 17:09:33,wallstreetbets,Tesla need our help. We can't let hedge funds destroy Papa Elon!!!
2021-05-17 17:04:04,wallstreetbets,I'll buy the dip.  Thanks Burry

2021-05-17 18:12:59,wallstreetbets,Dang... should I buy more Tesla?
2021-05-17 18:13:19,wallstreetbets,Burry is a fucking lizard brain. Can’t wait to see this bet blow up in his face.
2021-05-17 18:31:52,wallstreetbets,That’s all he has LOL broke ass
2021-05-17 19:23:58,wallstreetbets,Ok so what does this mean? Is he trying to short Tesla? Cause we can do the same as GME LOL
2021-05-17 16:10:52,wallstreetbets,Good.

2021-05-17 16:28:01,wallstreetbets,Damn I thought I was Michael burry cause my TSLA 400p options 100%’d lasted week but clearly he’s more Michael burry than I am

2021-05-17 17:07:27,wallstreetbets,It just says Burry puts expire Q1 it doesn’t say what year. It just says he’s long on some puts that expire Q1 lol I have 0 knowledge about his actual position
2021-05-17 17:07:40,wallstreetbets,Lmao imagine if everyone went all in on Tesla now 😂

2021-05-17 17:13:26,wallstreetbets,He is past his peak which was more than a decade back.
2021-05-17 17:15:04,wallstreetbets,michael still salty for selling early on GME
2021-05-17 17:25:39,wallstreetbets,Are we fucking this guy or not?
2021-05-17 17:38:45,wallstreetbets,I can’t wait to be part of the reason he goes broke

2021-05-17 18:00:37,wallstreetbets,“Reals”?
2021-05-17 18:10:13,wallstreetbets,Probably some more propaganda from CNBC. HFs have lost a fuck ton of money shorting Tesla.
2021-05-17 18:14:28,wallstreetbets,Anyone who has that amount of money and can foolishly potentially gamble it all away deserves to lose it all and I hope he does.
2021-05-17 18:16:52,wallstreetbets,I am buying me some Tesla
2021-05-17 18:40:48,wallstreetbets,Oh ok we all have to go an buy a share of tsla
2021-05-17 18:42:08,wallstreetbets,THIS IS THE WAY
2021-05-17 18:55:23,wallstreetbets,So What’s the plan?  are we all loading up on TSLA shares!?
2021-05-17 19:02:44,wallstreetbets,Duck him Tesla is fine
2021-05-17 19:17:16,wallstreetbets,"Puts on Tesla 
Calls on GME"
2021-05-17 19:21:18,wallstreetbets,"Tesla is way over rated, meanwhile ford has been around for decades and decades stock is under $20 come now !"
2021-05-17 19:22:29,wallstreetbets,"Yes, Tesla is les than many car companies. 
Mercedes-Benz invented the car, for example.
I worked 7 years in Audi in Germany in the development department until 2013. I had many meetings with the board members. They were not interested in EV because ""there is not the market yet"". 
Audi experts laugh at the engineering and quality of the Teslas, of all, only recognize the good software. Audi can develop 10 times more Teslas than Tesla if he wanted it, but still the EV market is niche market and its business plan is not based on the political Loby to achieve pollution credits in the USA, it is about producing real cars for real use.
They do some EV together with Porsche but with little engineering capacity %.
Yes, TSLA is a politicaly generated bubble!"
2021-05-17 19:31:23,wallstreetbets,This is the Id***t that has been spreading FUD everywhere because he hates $TSLA and Musk.
2021-05-17 19:43:10,wallstreetbets,That colonial pipeline outage told the whole  story on energy and BTU might ne telling the story on EV.
2021-05-17 19:45:55,wallstreetbets,Isn't this the same guy who sold GME before the surge?
2021-05-17 19:59:59,wallstreetbets,TSLA is going to 1000 by end of year.
2021-05-17 18:09:23,wallstreetbets,THERE CAN BE ONLY 1. Seriously tho Burry sometimes only holds positions for a quarter. It will be VERY interesting if he still has these puts on his next 13f
2021-05-17 17:20:14,wallstreetbets,"Even as a veteran of this sub, this just about made me poop my pants, yeeeesh and wowwwza"

2021-05-17 16:58:11,wallstreetbets,Elon doesn't have asbergers. He made that shit up. Go look at some footage of him from x.com / early PayPal days.
2021-05-17 18:42:31,wallstreetbets,"For those who don't read....this position was revealed due to regulatory filings.
It wasn't that he was showing off and like you said, it wasn't opened today."
2021-05-17 18:50:50,wallstreetbets,He has 8k put contracts. News drones think a put is a full value bet against the share.
2021-05-17 18:19:00,wallstreetbets,"You mean to say that the car company valued higher than all other major auto manufacturers *combined* might not be worth as much as the market says it is?

Michael Burry is a genius!

Edit: for all you “but Tesla isn’t a car company” retards:

In all of 2020 Tesla revenues were:

$29 Billion Automotive

$2 Billion Energy Generation and Storage.

Tesla is a car company.  The end."
2021-05-17 18:31:17,wallstreetbets,"im pretty sure he closed those today, maybe only some but he closed.

The whole world knows his position now so it's smart to close it before the bulls get any idea"
2021-05-17 18:46:27,wallstreetbets,True. The news now are sus rn. Maybe he just cashh out.
2021-05-17 19:02:26,wallstreetbets,"Why Tesla puts are stupid:

TSLA 500p expiring Jan. 2022 was worth $6500 mid February when TSLA was $800. It's worth $7500 today. Up 15%. Meanwhile the stock is down 28%

If you bought something more daring like TSLA 400p, you are losing money."
2021-05-17 19:49:21,wallstreetbets,"Necessary PSA, I'm sure a lot of people read that and thought that. He prob opened the position long before he tweeted about it"
2021-05-17 19:52:41,wallstreetbets,"Aren’t they $800 calls for 1-2023? If so, that’s a ways out still. Plenty of time for things to change or Burry exit the position if it does."
2021-05-17 18:53:32,wallstreetbets,He was early. But he's not wrong.

2021-05-17 16:17:34,wallstreetbets,This should be higher. Media can be so manipulative. He could have paid 8k for all they know.
2021-05-17 15:30:13,wallstreetbets,"I'm kinda surprised he'd buy puts instead of straight up shorting, don't puts carry for more risk because of expiration?"
2021-05-17 15:34:56,wallstreetbets,Plus he probably exited most if not all considering its getting media coverage. That filing was for March 31st.

2021-05-17 17:35:17,wallstreetbets,Maybe he’s actually ultra bullish on Tesla and the puts are one leg of a straddle.
2021-05-17 15:03:14,wallstreetbets,"He didn't buy 800k puts, he bought 8001 puts representing 800k shares, we don't know the strike price. The 534m is a red herring.

2021-05-17 18:13:33,wallstreetbets,"Self fulfilling prophecy. If Burry says the market will tank then a lot of ppl will immediately sell their positions and buy puts/shorts, or wait for the dip to end. Gov doesnt want the market to crash which is 1 reason they keep printing money."

> “So, @elonmusk, yes, I'm short $TSLA, but some free advice for a good guy....Seriously, issue 25-50% of your shares at the current ridiculous price. That's not dilution. You'd be cementing permanence and untold optionality. If there are buyers, sell that #TeslaSouffle,” Burry tweeted Tuesday night.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/michael-burry-big-short-fame-204146587.html"
2021-05-17 18:05:13,wallstreetbets,My understanding was he made his position when it was in the $600’s then it shot up to $900’s and now he is finally in the green?
2021-05-17 17:48:41,wallstreetbets,I remember this. I also got downvoted to hell for saying tesla is overpriced
2021-05-17 18:11:39,wallstreetbets,"He started shorting way before that, under $550. I'm sure he's been scaling up though so he might be green by now"
2021-05-17 18:34:31,wallstreetbets,"He didn’t do it at $900/share. I was following him when he did it, the share price was around $650. It went up to $900 after he shorted so he was probably sweating pretty hard during that time. There’s no telling if he even made money on the short despite the stock now being down."
2021-05-17 19:46:45,wallstreetbets,"This is what shorting stock is actually supposed to be for.  Calling overvalued companies on their bullshit, not kicking a company when it's down and chasing easy money."
2021-05-17 16:29:56,wallstreetbets,Call his fund and hope that they will tell you if you ask
2021-05-17 16:54:34,wallstreetbets,Convince him to get back on twitter and then ask.
2021-05-17 17:04:52,wallstreetbets,I mean couldn't you look at the options chain and take an educated guess for a large amount of contracts?
2021-05-17 17:33:39,wallstreetbets,Ask him to get back on Twitter like ur_mom on a rodeo horse...he was awesome on Twitter.
2021-05-17 18:54:33,wallstreetbets,Even if he tell you those details you will still get fucked.
2021-05-17 19:10:17,wallstreetbets,"And... that's why I got blocked. Hindsight says he is playing the media and retards like us. 

I was very familiar with his anti-tesla rhetoric. In the beginning, I thought he was trying to burn the entire company down in reality, he was just playing around the sentiment surrounding the stock. He doesn't have any particular agenda other than playing who ever he can. With the GME trade he played the hedge funds and with tesla shorts he played retailers. 

TSLA rocketed like nothing else. But that would mean a ""big short""-esque short position would bu(r)ry him financially. So, this could be alleged his positions are shorter than what people assume. I bet he already exited a major portion of the position and trying to see how the market would react to this planted news story. 

So, yeah. While we are playing 2d chess this guy is playing 4d chess."
2021-05-17 17:04:26,wallstreetbets,"13Fs do not give this information, so nobody will know unless Burry decides to divulge it."

2021-05-17 16:44:17,wallstreetbets,Not sure which one you’re talking about but yes
2021-05-17 17:50:59,wallstreetbets,"You’re right, Elon is trash"
2021-05-17 16:35:37,wallstreetbets,Hope he gets rekt.
2021-05-17 17:09:59,wallstreetbets,He bought GME at $2.00 you stupid fuck.
2021-05-17 16:12:19,wallstreetbets,"He made bank, these were probably bought 3 months ago."
2021-05-17 14:46:37,wallstreetbets,Maybe lol
2021-05-17 15:08:08,wallstreetbets,"hahaha Burry’s TSLA thesis doesn’t add anything new, it’s woefully daft: TSLA makes cars. But so does GM. therefore compare them with no distinction, just use textbook valuation. See? Easy right?"
2021-05-17 16:55:54,wallstreetbets,When are people going to realize what “priced in” means and the fact that a good company can have an overvalued stock
2021-05-17 15:21:22,wallstreetbets,yeah maybe by 2030 it will be worth the ATH again like microsoft was in 1999.
2021-05-17 15:15:09,wallstreetbets,Elon will tell you it’s gonna happen by 2025
2021-05-17 15:28:42,wallstreetbets,they already handed their trade secrets over to china and are losing market share in europe. they are just another car manufacturer lol
2021-05-17 15:25:38,wallstreetbets,"They can start by creating their own cells rather than buying Panasonic batteries, or their new China battery provider which is just cheap junk."
2021-05-17 19:21:39,wallstreetbets,"Not just that. Tesla is more than a car company. They are a tech company and will be up there as likes of FAANG soon enough. The self driving tech is 10 years ahead of anyone else’s, the cars are literally mobile compute servers (with redundancy), and they also are open to licensing their charging infrastructure (no one else has) and they make solar and all of the batteries. Way more batteries than any other company. It won’t be long before all of their competitors are making deals with Tesla to get batteries and charging infrastructure. (Already rumored that Toyota will be partnering with them on their EV line). Tesla is Amazon with AWS all over again imho. Give it time."
2021-05-17 18:25:05,wallstreetbets,Lmao how delusional can you get
2021-05-17 16:39:44,wallstreetbets,That would bring me joy
2021-05-17 15:27:36,wallstreetbets,why. he handed his trade secrets over to china. its over for tesla
2021-05-17 19:49:33,wallstreetbets,It's the same thing
2021-05-17 19:59:29,wallstreetbets,But he isn't shorting tesla....
2021-05-17 14:47:59,wallstreetbets,He bought them at like $4 or something ridiculous. You do not get to be Dr. Burry by YOLOing everything.
2021-05-17 14:53:09,wallstreetbets,"He bought for $4 and sold for $16. Thats a 400% gain. A majority of the people late to the party took a loss because they bought in for $300-$400+. 

I’d day Dr. Burry did better than most ;)"
2021-05-17 17:19:38,wallstreetbets,"This was filed a while ago, he's already printing cash on this put right now...."
2021-05-17 18:17:01,wallstreetbets,Is there some way they can both lose? That would be great.
2021-05-17 15:09:57,wallstreetbets,😐
2021-05-17 17:58:55,wallstreetbets,I dunno about that. He just saw a bubble.

You - a WSB smooth-head who can’t even spell the affliction right - can tell whether or not he has Asperger syndrome by simply watching a few interviews. 

I believe you and not him. Who has virtually nothing to gain by acknowledging that he suffers from it. 

I’m no fanboy. I’ve always thought Musk was a supreme douche. But get fucking real with your “clinical assessments”"
2021-05-17 17:04:42,wallstreetbets,Can you provide what made you come to the conclusion of him not having Asperger's? Like eye contact or something?

2021-05-17 18:30:00,wallstreetbets,It’s one thing to spot a bubble. It’s a whole other thing to bet half a billion dollars on when it’s gonna burst.

Michael Burry is putting his money on ""soon.""

2021-05-17 18:21:25,wallstreetbets,Yeah but they split there stock ! And they have plans to do very important things !!!
2021-05-17 19:44:26,wallstreetbets,"Sure, but many short sellers have lost their ass betting against them to this point. Timing is key for something like this, and I'm certainly not willing to bet e.g. half my net worth on that gamble."
2021-05-17 18:23:41,wallstreetbets,"At this point, Tesla is a lot more than a car company, the same way Amazon is more than an online retailer. But I make no claims as to the  value of its stock. There are too many weirdos both pro and anti Musk for any sense to be easily derived anywhere."
2021-05-17 18:37:31,wallstreetbets,"He is, because did you buy these puts? Lol. Guess not, but thanks again captain hindsight"
2021-05-17 18:27:36,wallstreetbets,But I thought TSLA was like owning an Index fund right????????
2021-05-17 18:36:17,wallstreetbets,"Wow hindsight 20/20 yea?

Why didnt you short tesla q1 then?"
2021-05-17 18:33:07,wallstreetbets,"Tesla is often misconstrued as a car company but the reality of the matter is that ""Tesla is a software company that also happens to make cars and slowly transforming into an energy company (telsa solar), communications company (starlink), space industry (SpaceX) and eventually a terraformimg a company a couple of decades from now. If you actually do an evaluation as to disruption in all those sectors like silicon valley has been known for you will notice that the stock assessment is nominal. But stocks are always speculative into the future. 

I respect Michael Burry and I am sure he must have had better understanding of shorting Tesla and therefore made money. But let's be real about what telsa is. Let's not obfuscate from the reality. 

Good luck and I hope you are able to see my point of view. Thank you. Peace always."
2021-05-17 18:25:08,wallstreetbets,They aren’t technically a car company. They’re a sustainable energy company. Carry on.
2021-05-17 18:45:16,wallstreetbets,"I think the idea that Tesla is a car company is the same incorrect argument as people who see an iPhone and think it’s just a phone.   

you should check out some of the things they’re working on.  It’s next level shit."
2021-05-17 19:12:33,wallstreetbets,"So, how much money did you make on it?"
2021-05-17 19:17:05,wallstreetbets,Throw some airplane makers in their too. TSLA valuation is true retard level.
2021-05-17 19:18:32,wallstreetbets,"Also didn't he lose a bunch last year shorting the same company?

No doubt Burry is brilliant but he certainly doesn't bat .1000"
2021-05-17 19:19:48,wallstreetbets,He may be right that it is extremely over valued (which it is) but he doesnt seem to take into account tesla and elon fandom. If GME has taught us anything its that a companies value does not have to reflect on its stock market price.
2021-05-17 19:23:40,wallstreetbets,The market can stay retarded longer than he can stay solvent
2021-05-17 19:28:35,wallstreetbets,"You say that now, but a lot of people told him he was wrong."
2021-05-17 19:29:50,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, but if you made these bets last year, you'd be fucked."
2021-05-17 19:45:10,wallstreetbets,Lol 😂
2021-05-17 19:50:23,wallstreetbets,"Tesla is trading on different, irrational, metrics. Hard to predict those."
2021-05-17 18:45:44,wallstreetbets,"It's not merely a new car company though. 


It's got IP all over the place:

..Solar

So I'm with Cathy Woods.This shit is just the beginning."
2021-05-17 18:57:18,wallstreetbets,Always such a silly argument.  Tesla is direct to consumer oem are direct to dealer at wholesale.  Not saying the valuation is justified but you can’t look at the market caps as a comparison.
2021-05-17 19:24:13,wallstreetbets,How about you do that analysis for tsla 800p...

2021-05-17 19:21:08,wallstreetbets,"For a fund of his size, he definitely has OTC puts, not listed."
2021-05-17 18:27:28,wallstreetbets,"financial media should understand finance better.  the report lists unit as share, but with options as instrument.  put 1+1 together and they can infer the outlay of the bet vs the notional exposure"
2021-05-17 16:32:05,wallstreetbets,Mmm I think the notional value refers to amount of shares represented by the puts. As far as I can tell we don't know the strike/date so hard to tell what the actual value of the puts is
2021-05-17 17:16:51,wallstreetbets,What does the MM part mean here? I keep seeing those initials but I'm having trouble looking them up
2021-05-17 15:34:00,wallstreetbets,true but you are likely not subject to margin call or monthly premium on puts...sure there is an expiration but if he long on puts his exposure is only what he paid up front for the contracts.
2021-05-17 16:39:35,wallstreetbets,"It's safer. You could end up like GME short. When traders find out that you have a large margin call they will jump in. Liik at the Ackman/Ichan/Herbalife  short fiasco.

With puts he has limited downside, i.e the premium."
2021-05-17 15:50:20,wallstreetbets,It's almost like he wants us to see it.
2021-05-17 15:42:27,wallstreetbets,"i'd assume he's buying puts for months out. shorts are usually returned within a couple days right unless you keep taking out new short positions? 

also as we know very well now, shorting technically has an infinite loss potential. not likely in a massive cap stock like tesla but better to buy puts and only risk your premium"
2021-05-17 16:59:07,wallstreetbets,I'm kinda surprised someone that rich does bullshit like this at all? Why fucking bother?
2021-05-17 17:06:32,wallstreetbets,"buy put, earned less but cap the risk. very smart guy"
2021-05-17 17:18:21,wallstreetbets,"Not really. Puts have a defined risk while short shares has an infinite risk. Puts in the WSB sense carry more risk because people here yolo them but they way Scion is probably using them, with a risk team monitoring all their positions, it's significantly less risk."
2021-05-17 17:25:50,wallstreetbets,Depends on what you mean by risk.  Shorts have an infinite ceiling for loss compared to puts. While you are more likely to lose the money with Puts you will only lose the cost of the contract.
2021-05-17 17:47:14,wallstreetbets,"Not really, the biggest risk with puts is that they expire worthless and you lose the premium you sank into them. The biggest risk with shorts is that you lose literally everything else you own to cover a margin call."
2021-05-17 17:59:05,wallstreetbets,Could he do both?   Don’t have to release short info do you?
2021-05-17 18:20:56,wallstreetbets,"If you are a dumbass and hold options to near or at expiration then yes. You are supposed to roll them out after theta decay hits a certain level, around 3 months it starts picking up quickly, 3 weeks is a real danger and 1 week you are mostly likely screwed if its not near your strike and a miracle does not happen. Just look up the theta decay curve. You are supposed to sell the options you have and roll them out further before it ever gets to that point."
2021-05-17 18:24:47,wallstreetbets,"Off the top of my head, it greatly limits your risk as you can simply not exercise them vs being stuck with a rocket to the moon that wont come down and locked up capital in shares for who knows how long. See Gamestop.  2) the options pricing that far out of the money may have cheap premium"
2021-05-17 18:29:03,wallstreetbets,"no.

shorting = short stock = unlimited risk.

long puts = risk is limited to the cost of premiums.

furthermore, he likely opened trade as a vertical spread -- so he has some short puts that offset the theta decay of the long puts -- but the short leg does not need to be filed in 13F"
2021-05-17 15:44:59,wallstreetbets,"Why would he exit such a perfect setup that’s been working wonders so far? It’s been my best short this year, I have no plans to exit anytime soon."
2021-05-17 15:09:52,wallstreetbets,"So the $534m is simply just Tesla’s share price on 3/31 multiplied by the 800,000 shares?"
2021-05-17 15:08:17,wallstreetbets,Nice. Good info. So we really have no idea what the actual price of the options were. The number of articles posted on this that fail to understand how a 13f works is pretty startling.
2021-05-17 15:10:27,wallstreetbets,Jesus. So much retardness. It's 8k puts.

2021-05-17 17:46:39,wallstreetbets,DFV is going to have to make a few more very public home runs to be in the same league.

2021-05-17 14:44:19,wallstreetbets,I'm the same. 😉
2021-05-17 19:01:08,wallstreetbets,What was his final take from GME? Wasn't he even earlier than DFV and for the wrong reasons (the right reason being the naked short squeeze retail squeeze)?
2021-05-17 14:42:36,wallstreetbets,"Ok, but like, Tesla (adjusted for split) is still 400% higher than it was less than a year and a half ago. So how much money did he lose before these successful puts?

Edit: how do we know his puts are ITM? As far as I can tell no details were disclosed other than the fact that he has 8,000 puts

Another article about today’s story mentions him speaking about being short Tesla back in December 2020, but even with Tesla’s huge drop of late it’s still only slightly below early December values"
2021-05-17 15:17:31,wallstreetbets,"Is that really it?

Everyone is acting like HF managers can't have Twitter account. Freaking Bill Ackman has a Twitter account and is very active on it???"
2021-05-17 17:26:26,wallstreetbets,Yeah he obviously sees things a little differently. Everyone calls you an idiot until you turn out to be right.
2021-05-17 17:46:05,wallstreetbets,"He also made some wrong predictions though for example he thought that Ra's al ghul didn't have a daughter  


Edit: Also remember that time he lost all of his Wayne Enterprise stock when someone got his fingerprint?"
2021-05-17 18:10:20,wallstreetbets,"Burry was very close to being too early on the housing collapse. If the banks pulled some more dirty tricks to delay the collapse for a year or two, Burry's hedge fund would have lost everything paying the premiums. The biggest chalenge with puts is you need to get timing right as well. Tesla could file for bankruptcy 1 day after your puts expire."
2021-05-17 19:01:33,wallstreetbets,"That is not pre-split though, the split was back in august, he first mentioned being short in December, with Tesla at 500+ post-split."
2021-05-17 18:17:35,wallstreetbets,Wow.. that's news to me. Well he got extremely lucky
2021-05-17 17:59:29,wallstreetbets,the problem is people have been saying this for 10 years

2021-05-17 17:18:13,wallstreetbets,What a great idea. Time to look up their office number
2021-05-17 18:11:40,wallstreetbets,Presumably he has options that are more liquid and therefore lumped in with a lot of others at the same strike/date.

As for China, even if they took all of Teslas trade secrets. That bodes badly for all other autos because now you're looking at Tesla and Chinese auto manufacturers as the best in the world. If the traditional autos aren't moving to EVs fast enough. You bet China will."

Tesla is reliant on tax credits for a profit. As soon as the tax incentive is no longer there, they’re in trouble if they’re still relying on them to turn a profit.

I'm not saying the valuation is attractive, but if you think tesla can hit on these technologies I'd take a bet at the current valuation.

2021-05-17 16:50:45,wallstreetbets,"Yup, Tesla made it all possible, but the first-to-market usually winds up with only around 40% of the mature market. This is still a *massive* opportunity for Tesla, but the stock was priced as though Tesla would *own* the market, like Amazon dominates the cloud-services market.

The first-to-market firm has to spend money to educate consumers and hammer out serious technical issues. Competitors can skip some of these costs.

&#x200B;

>Fifty years ago, General Electric published research that demonstrated in almost every market over the long term, the market leader ends up with a 40% market share, the number two player garners a 20% share, number three earns 10% and the rest of the market shares the remaining 30%. These numbers hold to this day, except for network effects businesses like online marketplaces where market leaders command more than a 90% share.

Note: Tesla may sell software, batteries and other components to some of their competitors (especially early on), so their share might end up being a bit higher than 40%.  


Edit: Instead of ""first-to-market"", I should have said ""first to hit product-market fit"". GM failed with an EV decades ago, and Google was something like the 10th major search engine."

It surprises me though because then you’re relying on timing and he’s proven he’s really early on things. If I had his money I think I’d probably stop trying to hit home runs on everything.

2021-05-17 19:30:17,wallstreetbets,"The op included a bunch of shit that Tesla has nothing to do with. I’m not agreeing with him. I’m just saying that Tesla isn’t just a CAR COMPANY. Their battery technology is incredible and key to everything that they do. There wouldn’t be Tesla vehicles without it, but it also allows them to better compete in the solar space, because their backup tech is top notch. As battery technology continues to improve, the Tesla is poised to make an absolute killing in the commercial solar + storage space, which could ultimately make that side of the business more profitable than their vehicle division. It would be more accurate to call them a BATTERY COMPANY that dabbles in cars than a CAR COMPANY."
2021-05-17 17:13:35,wallstreetbets,"Well, I'm asking aren't I? Why do we say ""I'm long"" or ""I'm short"" a stock?

Long and short mean opposite things, yeah?

In ""I'm long"" I'm talking about a long length of time.

In ""I'm short"" you are telling me it is NOT to do with a length of time and is NOT analogous to ""I'm long"" at all? Instead short means a quantity of something.

Nah, It means both. You don't want to be in a short position for a long time. Interest rates etc."

2021-05-17 18:55:02,wallstreetbets,Why is that said about basically any new stock? The stock has been shorted quite a lot with high borrow fees. And RKT had high short interest as well right? I really don't get these comments

2021-05-17 19:19:01,wallstreetbets,Well if there’s a run to $9 this week and those calls get exercised wouldn’t that cause a run up at least Monday due to all those shares being bought? OP might be right but their reasoning is just wrong. Sorry I’m retarded
2021-05-17 16:56:59,wallstreetbets,Sure. Investopedia says your calls will be red.

2021-05-17 16:22:20,wallstreetbets,"My recommendation to anyone new wanting to do options:

1. Buy nothing but 6 to 18 month LEAPS on a company you think will move.  Buy 5-10% out of the money, you will still make a nice % gain.  Sell it if you are up a decent amount in one day because a lot of times, a company will lose some of those gains tomorrow.  Wait for the stock to come down again into your buy area and repeat.
2. Buy 100 shares of a stock you like and do weekly covered calls a couple of dollars out on high volume, high premium options.  Set up a 3 to 6 month out put about 10% down from current price."

2021-05-17 17:43:01,wallstreetbets,"Teasing.... 

Of all the investing I've done, options trading is by far the most challenging. A few things I've learned: 

Nothing less than 90 days out. Preferably 120 or even 180. 

Be patient. Don't react. There are big swings daily. Sometimes hourly or even by the minute. 

Have a plan and use limit orders and sells. 

Buying on down days is good. But don't be afraid to buy a rising price... You can always average down. 

Go with your gut. Not what anybody says on CNBC or a message board. Or what friends think.  I've had friends talk me out of 5 figure gains :(

Good luck."

2021-05-17 14:15:31,wallstreetbets,"Look up the difference between Contango and Backwardation (two terms to describe commodity forward curve structure). Right now raw goods are in Backwardation meaning near term prices are higher than farther out price. 

This price structure incentivizes more supply NOW as opposed to later, as well as the physical good to not be stored in a warehouse or elsewhere for future use. 

In short, demand is higher than supply in the near term. The forward curve is betting that more supply will be brought online in later months, or there will be less demand leading to lower realized spot price."

2021-05-17 16:23:02,wallstreetbets,"All I know is that if the 10yr yield hits 2.25 most of the real big money is pulling it. And by the time we hit 2.50 the only people left in equities will be bag holding retail investors, be wary my friends this is starting to look like the plan. As the dollar just hit a double bottom and is poised for a spring upward, and the yield the same, technology will be slammed the hardest. It's quite over valued anyway and needs a good 40% correction imo.  I think this may occur between June and September, wiping out alot of retail investment money. Then the big boys come back and scarf up SPY and QQQ etf at super low bargains. As far as commodities are concerned, if the US loses its reserve status, we will all be super fucked....better start learning Chinese now."

2021-05-17 14:07:41,wallstreetbets,"I'm a certified lunatic and know nothing of futures or anything else related to the stock market or even the economy, heck I can barely tie my shoelaces, but inflation is never ""transitory"". Once prices rise, it is very difficult for them to come down again as managers generally don't want to lower revenue."
2021-05-17 14:53:53,wallstreetbets,"Biden will lift tarrifs on steel imports. This will cut US production of steel. This will also have a negative economic impact as jobs lost etc. 

Commodity prices may rise for a bit but when the economy tanks, the demand for commodities drops.

Much current commodity prices are due to global transport issues and China relations.

Also people expect a market crash and are turning to metals as a hedge. 

Grains are up on late cold snaps and transport."
2021-05-17 13:57:31,wallstreetbets,"yeah steel futures going down because supply chains still havent cuaght up post COVID. remember steel isnt just flipping a switch - need to rehire people, train, etc. And you only start that process when you're sure demand is there. So for a lot of companies that process just started recently. Eventually it will catch up and prices will settle. I believe inflation is transitory"
2021-05-17 15:04:42,wallstreetbets,"welp

thread closed"
2021-05-17 14:24:36,wallstreetbets,"Thats a textbook CFA response and I'm thinking something along the same lines. The shape of the futures curve does not seem to justify the idea that high inflation is permanent and is most likely transitory as the FED stated multiple times. 

Taking this further, I would think that valuation of mining and manufacturing companies are probably stretched enough as is especially when supply = demand and commodity prices are halted in their rally. 
Tech stocks might also be oversold as well since the fears that led to them going down is now mosyly unfounded, but I'm digressing.

2021-05-17 17:01:04,wallstreetbets,"You do realize he was the lead engineer for SpaceX in the beginning right?  At some point to scale at a certain pace you have to hire more people.  And hopefully you hire the best and brightest this world has to offer.  Elon can't be the best at every single thing.

So yes in more ways than one he was integral to this entire company.

Edit: spelling on mobile is hard."

2021-05-17 19:32:29,wallstreetbets,Lmao dead wrong. The lead rocket engineer and actual genius is Tom Mueller: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom\_Mueller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Mueller). Elon's got the world cucked thinking he's some six sigma exceptional mind. It's shockingly easy to \*sound\* conversant in rocket science. Actually building a rocket is the difficult part and he found a real engineer to do that.
2021-05-17 18:53:16,wallstreetbets,"He owned the company, he's not a rocket scientist lol. He calls himself technoking or whatever the fuck now at tsla, what does that even mean? He can call himself whatever he wants, it doesn't mean he is that thing."
2021-05-17 19:02:20,wallstreetbets,.......but muh messiah.
2021-05-17 19:00:40,wallstreetbets,Haha you really need to do some research. That change happened immediately there is no reason for it to drive the stock price up for the following two months.

2021-05-17 14:14:22,wallstreetbets,Agreed. My main account is TD but the last week or two I’ve been watching my charts on TOS and  executing on RH... got tired of paying .65 per contract when RH is free lol. I trade the swings so the fees were racking up.
2021-05-17 14:12:25,wallstreetbets,So nobody has to buy the $10.50 call option and it doesn’t have to reach it?

2021-05-17 14:14:09,wallstreetbets,Apply for options trading with your brokerage. Click buttons. Print receipt. Carryover capital losses in excess of $3k to future years. Repeat until homeless and turning tricks behind dumpster at neighborhood Wendy's for a frosty.
2021-05-17 14:21:29,wallstreetbets,Is there anyone else with free options and 2.5% margin fees?
2021-05-17 14:29:01,wallstreetbets,"Right 😂😂😂 I had dude telling me you end up paying them more but after using RH and TOS to trade the exact same thing side by side it was the same shit 
The only difference was RH would have my options set at the mid price (which is what I like ) and would sell it for the mid as well 


If the price moves I don’t have to edit my order"
2021-05-17 14:26:27,wallstreetbets,"I had a small $800 account and damn near spent $100 a week in fees I could have used that $100 idc what anyone says after a while it adds up 😂😂😂😂 and I have had all these platforms freeze on me so at this point it’s not even a negative reason for me to not use it. 


Dudes just don’t know wtf they be doing and don’t want that accountability"
2021-05-17 14:24:35,wallstreetbets,Bro that’s my exact same set up TOS on the iPad and Robinhood for the trade I got my fees down to .55 after asking twice 😂😂😂😂
2021-05-17 14:20:30,wallstreetbets,"Same here. Imagine how much opportunity cost there if long term is you make multiple trades a day. Especially with small cap stocks, like amc. I could easily spend thousands a month on fees."
2021-05-17 14:23:37,wallstreetbets,"Nah man if I fuck up and make a bad trade I can try again (even with me using risk management )
And I can use the exact same money that I made today and trade it on something else without risking my initial investment the shit is a game changer idc what anyone says 😂😂😂😂"
2021-05-17 14:16:22,wallstreetbets,"No offense, I’m sure that was hilarious to someone who understood. 🤣 but what IS a call option"
2021-05-17 18:08:57,wallstreetbets,😂😂😂😂😂 bruh 👌
2021-05-17 14:30:38,wallstreetbets,You’re exactly right Money is money and the more it costs to execute the trade the more is at risk even if it’s a small account (mine is). TOS is great with charting and I’ve gotten decent at timing/predicting... so now I just do it on RH. Anything I’m holding is on TD.
2021-05-17 14:28:28,wallstreetbets,That is awesome! Is there any research available or videos to explain further. I watched some videos about calls and puts and made two good call options. Had no idea this was an option.
2021-05-17 14:54:03,wallstreetbets,"It's a contract to buy 100 shares of a stock at a certain price by a certain date. Its value is a combination of time remaining on the contract, current price, and volatility. Many options traders here buy contracts where they hope the price of the stock and volatility will increase enough for them to sell the contract for a profit.  However, most options expire worthless."
2021-05-17 14:47:47,wallstreetbets,No offense taken. You initially asked how they work so I attempted to boil it down to the basics. Investopedia provides a solid textbook definition: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/calloption.asp

2021-05-17 14:30:47,wallstreetbets,"I’m very happy to hear I’m not alone in this.

I swear that I have “invested” (not even traded...) in Apple more than 10 times and I have lost money on it EVERY FUCKING TIME. It’s a running joke with friends. I’m the only person in the planet to loose money 10 times in a company that has only gone up for the last 20 years.

Anyway... I should warn you that I recently bought in at 127. Probably crashing to 90 dollars soon"
2021-05-17 17:45:46,wallstreetbets,"I'm with you on AAPL as well. The market is making everyone sell everything due to bonds and inflation no matter how well AAPL does. I have a few shares in AAPL and I still have faith in AAPL. Few weeks ago, I bought a leap call on AAPL. $117.50 call expires Sep. 22 2022. I know AAPL can reach $140 by next year"
2021-05-17 12:41:49,wallstreetbets,I have absolutely no intention of keeping this longer than 24 hours. I just bought the ones 2 weeks out just in case I’m very wrong I have time for a recovery. I’m hoping by end of day or tomorrow morning be out with a decent profit

2021-05-17 15:50:42,wallstreetbets,I’ve been buying in for like 6 months just sold my position to just let the money sit in 2 ETFs instead of the shit show that’s been going on
2021-05-17 17:41:21,wallstreetbets,"Good idea. Keep a sharp eye on your AAPL calls. The second it reaches $129, sell you calls for profit. If AAPL can reach $127 tomorrow, you are set for profit. With the way the market is, AAPL can move in either direction at anytime. Good luck and hopefully you come out with some profit money"
2021-05-17 16:03:29,wallstreetbets,Are you up?

2021-05-17 12:32:07,wallstreetbets,"I am guessing RIDE found its place in the highly competitive EV space but what remains to be seen is whether they can build a truck that doesn’t compromise the performance due to the weight of the battery. 
Americans love truck and with increasing home building demand, trucks are gna stick around for the average Americans simply because they are easy to drive and can load a ton of materials. 
Comparing the ev out there to this class, I don’t see any good option yet (someone can point me to one) 
What is difficult will be range and load capacity. If they don’t get it figure, that’ll be a disaster!"
2021-05-17 14:57:03,wallstreetbets,"I’m 1630 long @ 9.77. It’s gonna run. Camping World, Sept production, huge plant."
2021-05-17 15:38:41,wallstreetbets,Sounds like such a good investment that I leave all the stock for you.
2021-05-17 13:22:01,wallstreetbets,Fuk u I will not fall for this shit 3 times LOL
2021-05-17 12:28:05,wallstreetbets,Looking at market cap alone compared to other EVs (including SPAC/growth EVs) this is insanely undervalued. So much more room to run
2021-05-17 13:37:10,wallstreetbets,Workhorse has entered the chat
2021-05-17 14:04:20,wallstreetbets,Positions?
2021-05-17 15:17:30,wallstreetbets,"I think people should be very careful with this one - Steve Burns has been nothing but a fraud since day one and he has proven that over and over again. Although the chart analysis may be sound and it seems it’s ripe for a rebound, none of that matters when you are looking at a guy that said he was originally rolling out the new wave of electric vehicles in 2018 and has done nothing measurable since. EV has been solidified as the future of all vehicles and all the major players are taking action accordingly. This con artist isn’t beating anyone to market, and definitely not with a better product.

I hope I am wrong and you all make a bunch of money, but I think this production gets pushed out a time or two more and then things fizzle out."
2021-05-17 13:07:38,wallstreetbets,I think they are prob trash but I can afford 50 shares to see if I am wrong .I Think demand is going to be high enough that a lot of the EV startups that can produce will do better than not and if they don't do well they will get bought up anyway by other players who are behind in EV tech or consolidating.
2021-05-17 14:59:03,wallstreetbets,This stock is a fucking dog
2021-05-17 12:45:02,wallstreetbets,Lol boys get out of this POS while you can.  An open house happens right before you sell your house.  This thing going down to 0.

2021-05-17 12:52:26,wallstreetbets,What I dont understand is how people can jump on this hype and completely shit on GOEV. Everytime I see something about canoo there are always so many negative comments but with this no a single one... what gives?
2021-05-17 12:49:18,wallstreetbets,"This is a local company for me sheltered in the GM factory which was shuttered not too long ago right off the exit for the turnpike in Lordstown.  Hasn't this changed?

""The announcement came on the same day Lordstown Motors had been scheduled to release its first-quarter earnings report.  However, on Friday the company announced that the report and a conference call would be pushed back by one week until Monday, May 24, 2021.  No reason was given for the delay."""
2021-05-17 13:27:41,wallstreetbets,"My 873 shares have high hopes, but with the continued chip shortage I'm confused still on what they plan to do in September even if they have demand. Maybe I'm just dumb monke I don't know."
2021-05-17 16:32:43,wallstreetbets,Good my 15c leap has been gushing blood since the off-road jawn
2021-05-17 17:11:52,wallstreetbets,"F... uck you. 

Just kidding. Good luck 👍"
2021-05-17 12:12:14,wallstreetbets,"I've been riding 300 shares down from $12.

Calls have been looking ugly but still have time."
2021-05-17 12:25:00,wallstreetbets,"Ha, wish I could!"
2021-05-17 12:24:02,wallstreetbets,"No also they are still years away from actually producing production vehicles, (I grew up in the area) ppl I know, have said it’s going to go bankrupt"
2021-05-17 14:57:10,wallstreetbets,"I believe WKHS has a 10% stake in RIDE, so they should benefit if LMC is successful."
2021-05-17 14:57:45,wallstreetbets,Yes
2021-05-17 12:49:15,wallstreetbets,"Ok then if you say its complete fabrication then what company would you suggest is ""a leader in light duty EV trucks focusing on commercial fleets.""? Its a pretty specific target market atm."
2021-05-17 12:49:02,wallstreetbets,"But how do you know? They may have binding orders by now. ER is 5/24, tune in to find out."
2021-05-17 12:36:15,wallstreetbets,I'm hoping their upcoming open house will shed a lot of light on the Endurance and it's capabilities.
2021-05-17 12:45:59,wallstreetbets,You don't see competition ? Both Ford and Rivian will be selling electric trucks by next year. Im not even counting the Tesla monstrosity. I consider that to be a niche of its own.
2021-05-17 15:04:04,wallstreetbets,this is the way
2021-05-17 13:24:45,wallstreetbets,Understandable.
2021-05-17 12:30:12,wallstreetbets,That's how I feel about it too. Also love the plant tour transparency.
2021-05-17 12:34:09,wallstreetbets,Nothing to hide!
2021-05-17 13:41:47,wallstreetbets,Surprised WKHS hasn't gained some altitude today along with RIDE.
2021-05-17 14:06:15,wallstreetbets,"Me? Yes, I disclosed in the header."
2021-05-17 15:29:33,wallstreetbets,"The ER on 5/24 should offer some more perspective. The way I see it, he still has a chance to redeem himself with LMC. If he fails investors will not be kind."
2021-05-17 13:13:39,wallstreetbets,That's a reasonable gamble.
2021-05-17 15:02:24,wallstreetbets,Then they'll have their day.
2021-05-17 12:50:17,wallstreetbets,"Ha, I'll take my chances!"
2021-05-17 13:28:24,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, it's been a downward spiral. But, every dog has it's day. RIDE will reward patience, imo."
2021-05-17 12:55:02,wallstreetbets,It's not hype. They're holding an open house so investors can judge for themselves. Why can't Canoo simply do the same thing?
2021-05-17 13:38:41,wallstreetbets,"Imo, the chip shortage is a legitimate concern, just as it is for legacy automakers."
2021-05-17 12:17:24,wallstreetbets,45 shares at $13 🥲 too retarded to avg down. Just retarded enough to keep 💎🤲 til Sept
2021-05-17 12:30:12,wallstreetbets,Ummmm production begins in september?......
2021-05-17 14:00:32,wallstreetbets,"He knows it’s going to go bankrupt, because “he used to live in the area”? Seems legit"
2021-05-17 15:20:03,wallstreetbets,Why would they offer a tour of there factory to the public if they weren't on track for September?
2021-05-17 14:58:33,wallstreetbets,Ya that’s exactly what I was thinking and WKHS is really low right now
2021-05-17 13:17:45,wallstreetbets,"The light duty electric commercial fleet market, that has any volume. Is essentially Amazon. Guess who Amazon invested in. Rivian. Since essentially no one is purchasing or selling in that segment. I'd say you have to look at where big money went. To judge future sales  and so much money had poured into Rivian that they dont even have to go public"
2021-05-17 13:28:11,wallstreetbets,"They dont. If they did they would announce it. What I do know, is big commercial customers have poured billions into Rivian."
2021-05-17 16:03:14,wallstreetbets,"Yes of course I do! That is why LMC must execute and deliver a solid product to customers as soon as they can. And I think they're in a great position to do so, but the clock is ticking."
2021-05-17 13:11:31,wallstreetbets,Yeah that was talked about but so far I have only seen pictures of those. Point me to the place where they actually have prototype. Cybertruck price ppl out already and I don’t think many would fancy such an expensive car.
2021-05-17 14:05:59,wallstreetbets,"I think buying now into RIDE is a good choice for a quick ride up, Ford is doing the Ford Lightning PR on the 18th.  As for WKHS?  That was a deal totally ruined by DeJoy when he muscled out WKHS and picked Oshkosh.  Hopefully when Biden does his tour of Ford when they release the truck, it's a market wide uptick.... for the long term.  Playing calls that expire at the end of this week might be a good play for short term."
2021-05-17 14:16:09,wallstreetbets,"You dont post just “have position”. Strike, dates, avg cost if shares etc etc"
2021-05-17 13:03:58,wallstreetbets,"So you're telling me that they didn't roll a truck down a hill, have a truck burst into flames, lie about pre-orders, has a CEO that was pushed out of Workhorse for wasting R&D money and constantly missing deadlines, completely bombed an offroad challenge?  

All I'm saying is all Canoo did was pivot their buisness model..that's it.  They have vehicles in gamma testing, have crash test certificates, actual working vehicles tested under real world conditions, have their own IP and are still on track for deliveries starting 2022... Seems a bit fuked that a company like RIDE is valued higher than them.

Edit 1: it was Nikola that rolled a truck downhill not Lordstown."
2021-05-17 12:20:01,wallstreetbets,I would have doubled down but just held my bags after Baja.
2021-05-17 13:04:36,wallstreetbets,Allegedly
2021-05-17 15:00:42,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, just like they ""participated"" in that race in Baja last month"
2021-05-17 14:02:30,wallstreetbets,Sorry I clarified my statement
2021-05-17 18:49:01,wallstreetbets,"I'd encourage you to do some DD. Rivian does not have an electric truck targeting fleets. The only companies who have announced electric trucks that fleets would consider are Lordstown, Ford, and GM. Lordstown will beat Ford to market by 9-12 months, while GM won't be delivering their fleet trucks until 2023.

Therefore, it is accurate to call Lordstown the current leader."
2021-05-17 14:02:15,wallstreetbets,"Amazon, Walmart, fed ex and Gm, all promised to go carbon neutral by 2040. Imagine the headline “lordstown motors partners with (insert company name) in an effort to go carbon neutral by replacing their FLEEEETS of trucks that GUZZLE gas and diesel with nice electric trucks”"
2021-05-17 13:36:44,wallstreetbets,"You may be right, but I'll wait for the ER. Since it's not publically traded, little is known about the fundamentals of Rivian, except that they're looking to go public at some point."
2021-05-17 13:13:27,wallstreetbets,I believe Fords reveal is on the 19th.
2021-05-17 15:58:42,wallstreetbets,"Cybertruck prices people out? It's starting at $40k, probably the cheapest electric truck for awhile."
2021-05-17 14:42:46,wallstreetbets,"I’ve designed testing equipment for Lordstown, Rivian, Tesla, Ford, and GM. Lordstown and Tesla are the only ones I haven’t personally seen. I have had CAD data from Lordstown tho."
2021-05-17 19:56:36,wallstreetbets,Point me to a truck from Lordstown that has gone more than 40 miles.
2021-05-17 14:23:52,wallstreetbets,"Just curious, why is that important if you already know I have a bias?"
2021-05-17 13:11:59,wallstreetbets,All I'm saying is that a potential way to build investor confidence is to hold an open house. Great idea for when you're pre revenue and investors want more clarity.
2021-05-17 13:24:07,wallstreetbets,I thought Nikola rolled the truck down the hill?
2021-05-17 18:51:38,wallstreetbets,https://www.motortrend.com/news/2022-rivian-prime-delivery-van-first-look-review/  you'll notice some interesting facts in this story. Such as actual delivery contracts. And actual delivery style vehicles.
2021-05-17 13:18:17,wallstreetbets,"Okay let’s watch and see, cos I wouldn’t mind anyone having a crack at it. It’s an engineering marvel to say the least!"
2021-05-17 16:48:18,wallstreetbets,"Yeah,you wanna gamble buy  $F at $12 they know a thing or two about making trucks."
2021-05-17 19:57:17,wallstreetbets,"Yea, I'm gonna call bullshit on that. Just like the ""$35k model 3."""
2021-05-17 19:42:40,wallstreetbets,Hmm Wagner  you wouldn't have happened to work on the line at lordstown before??
2021-05-17 15:04:58,wallstreetbets,And?
2021-05-17 15:07:41,wallstreetbets,"It can lend weight to (or undermine) your DD.

For example:

Person A's DD: Hey guys, I love this stock, it cleaned up after my wife and her boyfriend, took out the trash, brought grandma back from the dead, and cured little Jimmy's polio. I'm long 1000 shares @ 50 avg with 100 Sept. 21 $60 calls.

Person B's DD: Hey guys, I love this stock, etc. I bought 5 shares when the price spiked to 2000 back in January. HELP PLS"
2021-05-17 13:37:49,wallstreetbets,The hill roll was Nikola I was wrong but the other points are valid.
2021-05-17 19:02:15,wallstreetbets,"That is not a pickup truck. Lordstown is not selling vans, they are selling fleet pickup trucks.

""a leader in electric light duty **trucks** focused on the commercial **fleet** market"""
2021-05-17 13:25:29,wallstreetbets,Motors in the hub are hardly a marvel. Or even new idea. Its generally considered dismissed as a poor idea.  For several reasons. Unsprung weight is a bad thing for ride and handling characteristics. It also puts the motors directly next to brake heat. And has them very low to the ground relatively speaking. Exposing them to deep water or mud also. In a sports car that might not matter. But in a 4wd truck. That will be an issue in the real world
2021-05-17 19:57:41,wallstreetbets,"No. I work for a Tier 1 supplier of testing/verification equipment. Dynos and whatnot. For Lordstown, we’re refurbishing our old GM machines that were already in the plant. 

Side note: Not sure why I get downvotes for saying I’ve seen vehicles that “actually have a prototype.”"
2021-05-17 15:16:39,wallstreetbets,Are you incapable of following the comment chain?
2021-05-17 15:23:53,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the explanation. I agree, and can see where that could be an additional positive, or negative. But there are also strict requirements on posting content, which I believe I've already met. Otherwise, I think I'd here from a mod and/or see my post deleted."
2021-05-17 15:55:17,wallstreetbets,"Pretty sure there's zero proof they lied about preorders, in fact the CEO clarified that quite awhile ago.

Also, the fact that they ran in the race recently is ultimately a good thing IMO, they showed that they have a working product that can drive offroad. Their main issue was not having enough battery charge, as well as navigation issues (admittedly due to inexperienced driver/navigator). No one expected them to win or even come close, they were just testing their product in a very public way.

So that leaves an outdated incident with a fire and complaints of a sketchy CEO. Almost sounds exactly like what happened with Tesla....."
2021-05-17 19:07:12,wallstreetbets,And all the biggest light commercial fleets on the world are vans. And if your local carpenter wants a pickup. Rivian and Ford will also have those long before Lordstown will.
2021-05-17 19:11:18,wallstreetbets,"My point was that knowing your specific positions can make or break your DD. If you make a good case for a stock and put your money where your mouth is, your DD will be more persuasive. If on the other hand you make a good case for a stock but then mealy-mouth your specific position, people might think you're just a bagholder who bought in at the peak and are trying to get others to rescue you (thus undermining your DD). Honestly, position is probably just as important as DD because without it, your reader has no way of knowing how seriously you take your own DD. In other words, don't bother to post DD without positions."
2021-05-17 16:11:49,wallstreetbets,"The Hindenburg report was pretty damning. Not to mention that the CEO confirmed to the WSJ that ""Lordstown paid consultants to generate preorders that were understood to be nonbinding."""
2021-05-17 19:22:37,wallstreetbets,"Actually, there are 4.7m class 1-5 fleet trucks in the US and only 3.4m vans & SUVs. So there is a huge market for fleet pickups.

https://www.bts.gov/content/us-automobile-and-truck-fleets-use-thousands"
2021-05-17 19:36:06,wallstreetbets,"I agree. And if I was promoting RIDE strictly on my own subjective view that is something I would certainly consider. But I can't really claim the DD I offered as my own, since it came by way of a communique from LMC themselves. And I think that is the best DD an individual investor can hope to receive."
2021-05-17 16:43:09,wallstreetbets,"Yeah... they hired people to reach out and secure preorders that are refundable. Again, this is exactly what Tesla did (just without consultants I'm assuming) and it's pretty normal, all their preorders are nonbinding.

There's nothing ""damning"" about what you pointed out, it's just that people misunderstand the terms of the preorders."
2021-05-17 19:31:48,wallstreetbets,"Thats a nice statement, that your completely misunderstanding.  Every carpenter has a fleet truck. Every landscaper has a fleet truck. Every Home depot store has a couple rental trucks.  They dont act in unison. And certainly aren't all going to be buying pickups from Youngstown Ohio.  Amazon, on the other hand. Actually orders in the 10s of thousands at one time. Real orders. Not fake marketing stunts. Game changing volume. Show me one single large fleet order for Lordstown."

2021-05-17 14:47:40,wallstreetbets,Nice to see WSB back to showing yolos with no backing leading to loss porn since they banned gme and amc talk. It has turned into a place to just lose money and watch people lose money lol

2021-05-17 14:36:20,wallstreetbets,I don’t have much faith in it right now but maybe you all know something I don’t. 1.6tril shares bothers me a but you’ll have a nice little return just on the upcoming dividend.

2021-05-17 16:27:04,wallstreetbets,Won’t mortgage lenders like UWMC get rinsed by the crazy inflation we’re about to have?
2021-05-17 16:31:19,wallstreetbets,Lol. Buying shares and calling it a yolo
2021-05-17 16:31:30,wallstreetbets,In Robinhood too 💀

2021-05-17 16:44:32,wallstreetbets,You bought the Friday 9 dollar calls too? Yuuup
2021-05-17 16:08:11,wallstreetbets,I went in big cuz Float decreased from last week down to 82M shares.  Today's volume will let UWMC buy 4M shares tomorrow.  @ 15 there's 20 million shares open interest with 10M shares borrowed short.  Ingredients are there for an epic rally.  Just need the first domino to fall this week.
2021-05-17 19:42:43,wallstreetbets,Only a few retards can be lucky.
2021-05-17 18:11:50,wallstreetbets,I'm smiling on all of us ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|sweat_smile)

2021-05-17 17:45:03,wallstreetbets,Me too! 😂
2021-05-17 15:11:25,wallstreetbets,"What do you mean, fellow human?"
2021-05-17 17:02:49,wallstreetbets,Which accounts? List some of the bot accounts if you've identified them. I see some newish accounts but can't find any that are obvious bots
2021-05-17 13:05:49,wallstreetbets,"Dude, look at the people posting. It's all new accounts. This sub is full of bots 😂😂"
2021-05-17 15:24:31,wallstreetbets,"Agreed. Plus the ticket is for UWM, not UWMC."
2021-05-17 16:08:09,wallstreetbets,It’s hilarious. So many bot posts. Subs gone to shit
2021-05-17 17:26:28,wallstreetbets,This comment can't stop me because I can't read
2021-05-17 13:38:59,wallstreetbets,"It’s getting ridiculous, and then you just see 100 posts: I LikE thE sToCk!   I went in on UWMC $10 Calls for 6/18 on Friday, they popped 150% this morning, cashed out, moving on. The 5/21s were up like 1000%."
2021-05-17 12:16:56,wallstreetbets,you have spoken!
2021-05-17 19:05:22,wallstreetbets,"I would say UWMC, worst case is it pays a dividend and its a profitable company."
2021-05-17 12:19:41,wallstreetbets,Fuck the bucket I’ll hold them for him
2021-05-17 13:13:48,wallstreetbets,"I just put 20k in today, Glad to be apart of.the retard gang."
2021-05-17 17:45:07,wallstreetbets,I’m an old account. And am in UWMC... can I get a hedge to pay me too?
2021-05-17 15:55:00,wallstreetbets,"So obvious at this point lol, can't wait for the loss porn"
2021-05-17 13:19:45,wallstreetbets,Lots of early volume. Should pick up this afternoon too
2021-05-17 17:52:18,wallstreetbets,Lol. Stop it. Most are just newbies
2021-05-17 17:43:00,wallstreetbets,I think its the 100% utilization rate plus the <300% cost to borrow average. The dividend +buy back must be driving out the shorts
2021-05-17 12:52:53,wallstreetbets,8.31 is really not bagholding
2021-05-17 14:06:47,wallstreetbets,entire market was collapsing.  I say UWMC is doing pretty well considering.
2021-05-17 14:12:28,wallstreetbets,This is great price action. Slow grind up makes it more stable. End of week is when u will see the biggest move with options expiring
2021-05-17 12:53:13,wallstreetbets,"And it’s back up again. 

UWMC has been green every day since Earnings."
2021-05-17 15:07:37,wallstreetbets,1.6tril? What?
2021-05-17 16:14:18,wallstreetbets,House prices are skyrocketing and interest rates are at an all time low. Best time to buy uwmc is rn. 2nd quarter earnings are projected to be almost double than first quarter. If youre scared of the bubble popping then sell after 2nd quarter earnings.
2021-05-17 17:47:30,wallstreetbets,Completely different scenario on the horizon. The 2008 crash happened because bad loans were being given. Right now you need to over bid for a chance at a house because the shortage plus demand. While I think the crash will come it wont come till we start building more homes
2021-05-17 18:20:32,wallstreetbets,"lol yeah you should, then look up the measures taken to prevent it from ever happening again."
2021-05-17 16:14:08,wallstreetbets,"I bought in cuz a buy back was announced with heavy short interest.  last week free float was at 90M, today free float is 82M.  20 million shares open interest @ 15$ expire this friday.  If the first domino falls, (going to higher tha 9$ by friday) naked shorts will be forced to buy back shares pushing it up forcing the borrowed shorts to close out their positions.  Last failure to deliver report from the sec had 300k shares fail to deliver when the stock was dropping.  I think bears are caught ouf of position."
2021-05-17 16:28:36,wallstreetbets,it ain't a loss if i don't sell.
2021-05-17 16:36:51,wallstreetbets,"There is no ""crazy"" inflation coming"
2021-05-17 16:27:44,wallstreetbets,It ain't a loss if you don't sell
2021-05-17 18:02:17,wallstreetbets,Friday 9 dollar calls? What’s that
2021-05-17 17:12:21,wallstreetbets,Me too
2021-05-17 17:01:49,wallstreetbets,Lol epic rally?! What the
2021-05-17 15:17:23,wallstreetbets,"Look at the OP and all the top comments profiles, they're all new accounts aka bots"
2021-05-17 14:10:55,wallstreetbets,Is the 53 day new account calling others with new accounts bots?
2021-05-17 14:11:20,wallstreetbets,"Definitely not possible that new accounts are the 8 million that flooded in during the GME saga, huh? Nope. All bots."
2021-05-17 14:28:39,wallstreetbets,This guy is calling everyone a bot.
2021-05-17 17:35:45,wallstreetbets,"The company = UWM, ticker = UWMC."

2021-05-17 18:43:05,wallstreetbets,We need to band together and watch our money burn lol down 23k until today
2021-05-17 14:11:16,wallstreetbets,"I was bag holding at $10, but I kept buying the dip like it's guac and now I'm profiting at 7.67."
2021-05-17 14:40:47,wallstreetbets,This. Glad I moved my 30k of TQQQ into UWMC premarket
2021-05-17 13:33:30,wallstreetbets,I feel like a lot gets hyped up and doesn’t live up to the hype. It usually peaks a bit and then it dumps. I feel like the people who have a lot invested hype all the smaller daily traders to spike it up and then they take their money leaving all the little guys hanging 🤷🏽‍♂️ just my observation.
2021-05-17 15:28:10,wallstreetbets,Shares outstanding
2021-05-17 17:25:09,wallstreetbets,"If this runs to 12.50 at EOD on Friday, next week is going to be a bloodbath for bears."

These are surely humans like myself. A robot would not lie.

That is a humorous statement.

2021-05-17 16:38:04,wallstreetbets,Am I the one indicing others to buy something and putting all my intentions in one comment?

2021-05-17 14:56:22,wallstreetbets,When do “bots” no longer be called bots?
2021-05-17 18:00:39,wallstreetbets,"But the ticket in the screenshot is UWM, which is Proshares. Unless I'm missing something"
2021-05-17 19:42:58,wallstreetbets,Haha I would have. But wasn’t a very big play. Just like $360 into $928.
2021-05-17 13:59:25,wallstreetbets,I love you too
2021-05-17 14:16:31,wallstreetbets,Thats the spirit!
2021-05-17 13:58:30,wallstreetbets,"Of course a lot gets hyped. Gotta do your DD to see what is legit. 

This has a buyback catalyst with strong Q2 guidance. 

Even if no squeeze, it still hasn’t hit its $9-14 price targets. 

And the short borrow fee is there."
2021-05-17 15:40:55,wallstreetbets,"Er, UWMC has 110 million shares outstanding and around 90 million floating, with a 300 million buyback approved.

They give out a 0.10 dividend a quarter, with 1.6 trillion shares outstanding that would be.... expensive."
2021-05-17 16:50:25,wallstreetbets,That has been happening for a looong time anyway
2021-05-17 19:07:57,wallstreetbets,You mean all those companies selling stock sentiment analysis tools don't have bots too?
2021-05-17 18:35:53,wallstreetbets,"If my account is new and I post here, does this make me a Bot-tard?"
2021-05-17 15:13:57,wallstreetbets,When the account is older and more active than the person making the accusation?
2021-05-17 18:34:42,wallstreetbets,"Nah, that's still UWMC. UWMC is the ticker for UWM, so Robinhood listed the title as UWM."
2021-05-17 15:44:33,wallstreetbets,Fidelity shows 1.6tril outstanding

2021-05-17 17:41:37,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-05-17 18:35:25,wallstreetbets,"Ahhhhh, fair enough. I stand corrected"
2021-05-17 16:06:58,wallstreetbets,"Don't have fidelity (and can't find the shares outstanding on the [Fidelity eResearch](https://eresearch.fidelity.com/eresearch/evaluate/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=UWMC) site). But [YAHOO](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/UWMC/key-statistics/), which is easier to read, has 103.1m shares outstanding and [Marketwatch](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/uwmc) has a float of \~93 million shares.

DeGiro, which I use being a europoor, shows 113.729M shares outstanding and 89.916M shares in the float."
2021-05-17 17:43:05,wallstreetbets,"Yes, it's an evolving situation and I think there is some estimating going on as the various outlets won't know 100% for sure when the float has been bought back until UWMC announce it."
2021-05-17 16:11:54,wallstreetbets,"Yea my broker shows 80M float, dont know why a stock with 1.6tril shares would be priced at $8."
2021-05-17 16:12:24,wallstreetbets,"Big difference in those numbers. I wonder why that is. 

Here’s a snapshot from the Fidelity app. 

https://imgur.com/gallery/nSqEAtS"
2021-05-17 17:41:31,wallstreetbets,That *is* to be an error. They have a 0.10/share dividend for the quarter and frankly if they could afford a 160 billion dividend per quarter I'd be quite impressed!
2021-05-17 18:04:01,wallstreetbets,That’s why I haven’t touched this stock. Okay he numbers made no sense so I have steered clear. But I checked your sources and they are more consistent numbers. I’m a bit peeved that Fidelity has the wrong info.

2021-05-17 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Western Digital - The Next Nvidia As the cloud & big data continues to grow, as well as social media & 4k/8k video, data storage is becoming more important than ever.

Large social media sites take in a tremendous amount of data each day. This storage must not only be stored, but stored with redundancy as well as backups. Major sites such as Facebook and YouTube keep content that is over a decade old. Over time, the drives holding this content will fail and need to be replaced, leading to growing recurring demand as the size of the platform grows.

The need for storage has been growing for decades, but innovation in storage density and intense competition has limited profitability in the market in the past. That being said, there is reason to believe that the growth in storage density may stop keeping up with the growth in storage needs.

There is also reason to believe that transient growth in storage demand may drive higher Q2 earnings. A new digital currency, Chia, has gobbled up about 6 Exabytes worth of storage in the past 3 weeks, now growing at a rate of about 0.4 EiB per day(and rising). https://www.chiaexplorer.com/charts/netspace

For reference, about 288 Exabytes worth of hard drives were shipped in Q1 2021 https://www.tomshardware.com/news/hdd-shipments-in-q1-2021

Chia network size can be considered a lagging indicator for unexpected drive shipments. Generally, it can take a few weeks between when a drive is purchased and when it's actually accounted for on the network, as it takes time for it to be shipped, set up, and plotted. Chia wasn't even listed on exchanges until a couple weeks ago, so most of the growth seen is prior to Chia even having a price. At current prices, mining is incredibly profitable, with a $500 14 TB drive estimated to produce about $26 per day, and using very little power. So even if the network grows 10x to 60 Exabytes, it's still producing $3/day at current prices. So expect the surge in demand to continue.

I have seen many anecdotes of drive shortages over the past couple weeks. Reviewing sites like Amazon, I have also seen high capacity drives go out of stock or require lead times of a few weeks.

This may be a bit reminiscent of GPU shortages among Nvidia and AMD as miners seek to buy up anything they can.

If we project continued growth at 0.4 Exabytes a day in unexpected demand from proof of storage over the next 40 days, plus the 6 Exabytes added since April 20(leaving out first 3 weeks in quarter as they were likely logged last quarter), that's about 22 Exabytes to be added in Q2 that are not part of normal usage, or about an extra ~8% of Q1 demand.

What's perhaps most interesting is the impact this could have on margins. Unlike the GPUs used to mine which are consumer devices, the devices used for mining Chia includes enterprise grade hardware. Prices in the drive market are more flexible at the manufacturer level, and currently have much lower margins. If proof of storage currencies cause a drive shortage, it could have a significant impact on margins. Western digital sells about 40% of its drives through distributors, Seagate about 30%. Sales through these channels generally are very responsive to demand trends in terms of prices.

Seagate is also in a position to profit from this, but I'm a bit more worried about them as hard drive shipments have been on a long term decline and they aren't diversified into SSDs/flash like Western Digital is.

My positions: ~$21k Western Digital, ~$6k Seagate"

2021-05-17 10:56:48,wallstreetbets,"I like your thinking on Chia, my concern is that there is a finite amount of blocks produced every day, so each hard drive that comes to the game will have a lower chance of being able to get assigned a block. But for short term, this ape likes your idea."
2021-05-17 11:27:47,wallstreetbets,"Chia uses UN-USED disk space, as in the white space.

But not always, if you have a dedicated CHIA miner, then you'll dedicate all of the hard drives to it I assume."

2021-05-17 12:07:14,wallstreetbets,"Look at the history, WDC is recovering. It had a stock price over 100 only a few years ago before the price of NAND flash decreased profits."
2021-05-17 15:32:39,wallstreetbets,Never ever ever let this mentality keep you out of a trade. The market is littered with countless examples of stocks hitting new highs and continuing even higher without much of a pullback along the way.
2021-05-17 11:49:22,wallstreetbets,"Most stocks are at the highest price in a year, there's been a huge bull market. Still cheaper than 2018."
2021-05-17 11:46:27,wallstreetbets,"I think there will be short terms earning beat, but long term WDC is still an excellent play. 

Chia is barely on any exchanges yet has already depleted stocks of hard drives (look on amazon right now for HDDs >10tb). Chia will soon have pools which will allow tons of smaller players to make predictable profits and further demand. Chia probs won't be the latest proof of stake we see, especially with focus on power use. WDC is in a much better position to take advantage of this all than seagate because WD HDDs are more reliable and make farming more economical."

Meaning you can have about double the size of the position in shares, and about 99% the profit (delta) of any rise. Just sell before $30 if it starts tanking. Ez"
2021-05-17 12:04:55,wallstreetbets,"Hey I also wish I had higher risk tolance, I'm looking at july 90cs I had bookmarked now up like 200% and I didn't want to risk it so I went with 1 leap instead.

2021-05-17 17:42:54,wallstreetbets,"I've waited months for a price to drop to buy, then when I buy in it is 10% higher than if I had bought at the previous ""high"" that got me nervous to buy at. The only thing I'd add is get your exit price ready before you buy unless it's a long term hold. Because if it keeps ripping up and there's no support it can be a bloody downturn. See PLUG and FCEL in the last few months"
2021-05-17 11:32:00,wallstreetbets,What do you think data storage happen where? Not in real clouds my friend... Its all memory!
2021-05-17 13:46:21,wallstreetbets,"Nobody saw the Chia demand coming, this is a different catalyst than whatever that guy believed in"
2021-05-17 13:37:37,wallstreetbets,"True. The red week last week was a good time to buy, and if it returns to below 70 its an insta buy from me. I didnt expect it to pop off again today either, and it seems option activity, share volume and articles are now taking off. I was getting ready to post my own DD but every bit of DD I posted before got removed by mods so I was discouraged and didn't get around to fully doing the DD until this weekend.

I of course yolod like 10k into it strictly cause I was trying to capitalize on Chia which I couldnt do by mining since all the hard drives sold out. The DD was just double checking how dumb that idea was, which in hindsight was not dumb at all."
2021-05-17 17:49:15,wallstreetbets,"But then the one time where you DO nail the peak burns you so bad you think ‘shit that was dumb I’m never buying at the highs again’. I see so many posts here either ‘don’t buy it, it’s already up X%, can’t go up more’ (it does) or ‘I’m buying this because it’s beaten down and it can’t go any lower’ (it does). Completely backwards when it comes to trading. New highs beget new highs; same goes for new lows."
2021-05-17 11:37:15,wallstreetbets,"That's true! However, there is a difference between memory (RAM) and storage (hard disks and solid state drives). Micron is a leading memory manufacturer, while Western Digital makes mostly hard disks (and some SSDs more recently). Chia (mostly) requires hard disks. Micron makes some excellent products (GDDR6X is really an engineering masterpiece), but they are *not* useful in mining Chia, which as far as I understand, is the basis to OP's play."
2021-05-17 11:37:47,wallstreetbets,"No, chia is all HDDs. WD is vertically integrated and make their own."
2021-05-17 11:46:30,wallstreetbets,"Micron is leading in enterprise SSDs as well sir. Its not a memory company anymore (which was used to be its niche) but has transitioned themselves into solution based company. 

Their internal controller (in house) made SSDs are top notch bang to bucks when it is compared to their competitors. 

Anyways, looks like OP also not wrong. I can see WD soaring the charts right now... 

To the MOON memory companies!!!"

It doesn’t happen overnight so while earnings beats are happening revenue expectations and cash flow numbers aren’t meeting share holder expectations which is why Culp’s pay wasn’t approved. However, Culp has promised that GE’s cash flow out look is greatly improving and Q2 will be a big win. But my yolo calls have nothing to do with any actual DD.

However as the price moves up and the options increase in delta the MM’s will need to buy back millions of shares creating a massive “gamma” squeeze, this is on top of the 22% SI on the free float, once it surpasses $9 the MM’s will start buying up shit loads of shares to hedge themselves forcing the shorts to cover because the buying pressure will drive the price up,  or they lose a lot of money. Not to mention there’s a 300m buyback retiring shares every day depleting the float pool. Which is why the stock needs to reach $9 to set up the domino effect."

2021-05-17 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$UWMC - The Long View $UWMC has become one of the most hyped stocks in the online investment community. Online activity appears to be ramping up after earnings and heading into May 21st option expiries. Since UWM is getting a lot of new eyes, it seemed like an appropriate time to share why some investors may consider UWM as a long term hold. 

UWM is a mortgage company that focuses exclusively on the broker channel. It’s the largest wholesale mortgage provider in the US and the second largest mortgage originator, behind Rocket Companies. 

It’s CEO is Mat Ishbia, who started as it’s 12th employee and who’s dad, Jeff, started the company as a side hustle. Mat and his brother own 94% of the company in Class D shares. The rest of the public float, \~100m Class A shares, are what is available for the public to purchase. 

# What trends are pushing $UWMC’s stock down? 

**The largest threat UWM is facing is raising interest rates**: 

About 75% of UWM income is related to refinance activity. The pandemic pushed rates to historic lows so most consumers were better off refinancing. Millions have done that, leading to record profit for mortgage providers like UWM and Rocket. 

**The strength of the broker channel:**

UWM is completely dependent on brokers finding business and closing loans. It doesn’t have any direct-to-consumer lending operations like Rocket does. 

**Short Interest:** 

Sophisticated investors are seeing 75% of income potentially attached to rate sensitive products (not all refi’s are rate sensitive like cash out), and are salivating. They think the market is under appreciating this headwind and shorting the stock. They have basically shorted all the shares they can. Friday the stock ended with 200 shares available and an insane 93% borrow rate. 

**SPAC:**

It is true that the SPAC market has softened recently. It is very reasonable to assume $UWMC is a part of that softening. It may not attract institutional investors because of the SPAC situation and the short period it has been publicly traded. Lots of other nice places to put institutional money.

**Competitors:** Mortgages are a mature market and competition is fierce. Rocket, LoanDepot and UWM mentioned a pricing war in their earnings. (LD statement). This will compress loan sale margins in the short term. 

**What trends are pushing $UWMC stock up?** 

**Short term retail pressure:**

there is a lot of retail attention on the potential short squeeze/gamma squeeze you could see this week in UWMC. My post is about UWM’s long term perspective, so I’ll let [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ndcm0p/uwmc_is_a_powderkeg_low_float_high_short_huge/) take you further down that rabbit hole. Additionally, smart money is now tracking online sentiment, which can lead to increased institutional purchases. 

**Broker Channel Growth:** Mat has claimed two reasons for taking UWM public. He wanted access to the liquidity market and marketing exposure for the broker channel. For UWM to become the largest mortgage originator, Mat has targeted ⅓ mortgages to be originated by brokers and UWM to own 50% of that channel by 2025/26. Currently UWM owns 36% of the broker channel with brokers originating 20% of all mortgages. Before the housing crisis in 2008, brokers were 58% of mortgage originations (Per Mat & Q1 2021 Earnings call), so it isn’t crazy to think they could get back to ⅓ as it is growing: [https://www.nationalmortgagenews.com/news/why-the-mortgage-broker-channel-has-been-gaining-momentum](https://www.nationalmortgagenews.com/news/why-the-mortgage-broker-channel-has-been-gaining-momentum)

I had a loan with Rocket and tried to refinance with them. I then went through a mortgage broker and got the same loan for $4.5k cheaper in closing costs. This is because Rocket’s retail channel has 4% margins and it’s partnership network (includes wholesale, realtors, etc.) has 1% margins. 

**New Product Offerings:** 

UWM recently released new products like their jumbo loan. In earnings, Mat said he expects $2b in volume from Jumbo. They also added ARM’s, manufactured homes and expanded government programs. 

**Wholesale mortgage provider consolidation:** 

Mat said 3 of the top 25 wholesale lenders have been purchased in the last 90 days. This type of consolidation happens in mature markets by companies that are reaching for market share. THis could be a sign companies are under pressure to grow but cannot organically get market share from UWM. 

**UWM “All In” Ultimatum:** 

Rocket and Fairway are priortizing other channels (cause the margins are so much higher) and trying to squeeze out brokers. UWM said if you work with those two, don’t work for us. The goal was to stand up for the broker channel WHILE putting some pressure on Rocket and Fairway’s partnership channel. This may have kickstarted the pricing war. 

**Aggressive Capital returns:** 

UWM pays an annual .40 dividend on its class A shares. That only costs them \~$42m/year. Remember their Q1 net income was $800m+. So their dividends hardly affect the balance sheet. The board just approved a $300/million share buyback as well that will reduce share count. Mat knows a thing or two about shorting stocks. He just sold at $10 and has authority to buy back with the current price under $8. The man successfully shorted his own company. What a legend. 

**Long Term Prediction:** 

I’m invested in UWM because I believe the capital returns will be aggressive during the upswing and the company will remain profitable in a downturn. With a 5%+ dividend return, share buyback, and \*potentially\* growing market share, UWM could be primed to overtake Rocket within the next few years.

Price Target: $14/share in 2023"
2021-05-17 10:05:55,wallstreetbets,I had to google UWMC at this point....saw that its University of Minnesota Women's Club...sounds like a rocket
2021-05-17 15:01:34,wallstreetbets,"I work as part of a mortgage brokerage.

I think that one thing you could consider is that yes Quicken(RocketProTPO) and Fairway do have some issues with how they can take clients from the broker. But usually this is not something that really harms a mortgage broker since your client tends to deal with you directly as well. They would at least remember if you did a good job getting their loan done. 

If you ever did refinancing or bought a home, you would probably have wanted to check several lenders regarding No Point No Fee or At Par rate. That's why you would ask a mortgage broker to check for you. You also want to QUALIFY for a loan.

I won't deny that UWM can have excellent service and pricing, but sometimes another lender can have better pricing. No loan is ever considered the same with any lender. Some lenders are more flexible than others with how they consider client's income and documentation. UWM can have some strange documentation requirements when it comes to self-employed borrowers.

But what UWM did here, aka make the exclusive activity agreement, was not fair to the brokers or partners they had. 

UWM's declaration goes against mortgage broker's main purpose, stating you can't work with people we choose to fight with on pricing, or else 1. Your company eats a $50,000 fine, and 2. We kick you out of the agreement and all new loans submitted hereon are thrown out. Shouldn't they just kick out partners? Where on earth does a fine need to come in like that?
 
The other thing is...how would they even know? I don't think that can be done without getting invasive on some information.

**The issue is that once this becomes a precedent, UWM can force out other lenders with pricing similar if not better to theirs if more brokers are fine with this. I do not really buy into them dealing with just Quicken and Fairway far into the future**

LoanDepot does not compete with either UWM or Quicken in terms of service and possibly pricing so far as I've seen and experienced, so why would UWM mind them?

I also am not sure how closing costs would drastically differ between Quicken and UWM. Both charge similar underwriting fees. Escrow fees are fixed by the government and county to a certain amount of variance.

Usually the main problem is how much credit or charge you get at a certain rate. Appraisals and credit reports can vary, but usually aren't more than $1,000 depending on some factors.

**I do think UWMC is a good stock to get**, but I wanted to clarify the information on how the exclusive partnership appears from a broker's POV."

2021-05-17 13:01:23,wallstreetbets,"It’s not UWMC I worry about, it’s rising costs of home building materials (industrial goods overall) and a slowdown in the housing market.  Any rate rise will screech refinancing to a halt.  They’re a great company who did right by their investors with that buyback. Bullish short, bear long."
2021-05-17 13:05:10,wallstreetbets,Im in
2021-05-17 13:13:49,wallstreetbets,Up 100% on my 10c for June so far i think we will see it run until the dividend record date in early June
2021-05-17 13:18:56,wallstreetbets,I just wonder. When we will have a higher stockprice than RKT. In a year or so we should have a chance no? If we could gain marketshare and catch the momentum? What do you all think?
2021-05-17 13:20:06,wallstreetbets,Can somebody also explain the sudden drop in fee from 93 to 21? Only 45000 shares available that's still not much. https://iborrowdesk.com/report/UWMC
2021-05-17 13:21:14,wallstreetbets,Just bought 10 contracts on the 7.5 strike price set to expire on 5/21. Come on boys.
2021-05-17 13:29:22,wallstreetbets,"What about the rumour of the buy back being all the class A shares that pay dividends, so retail will no longer be eligible for dividends?"
2021-05-17 14:20:25,wallstreetbets,"UWMC for short term; their q2 numbers should be good as well. But for 2-5 yrs its a terrible long play. Initially UWMC killed the market cuz their technology and service made life easier for brokers but their pricing is always higher to compensate for ease of use. With rates projected to rise, UWMC will suffer with the rest of the financial industry. Not financial advice, but this is just my take as being in the industry. I actually am bullish on the short term but not as a long."
2021-05-17 14:37:33,wallstreetbets,Just got in  only 150 shares…

2021-05-17 13:45:29,wallstreetbets,UWMC has some possibilities with the stock but back etc... end game it’s got nowhere to go but down. Broker channel has the thinnest margins of all mortgage origination channels. 2020 was the highest margins the mortgage industry has seen in a very long time. As rates rise and refinances dry up so will the brokers volume/UWMC.
2021-05-17 13:55:47,wallstreetbets,Uwmc employees are active!
2021-05-17 14:40:11,wallstreetbets,Bought ten shares and one call.

2021-05-17 15:08:44,wallstreetbets,Thank you for writing this. I might write up a larger response but generally I agree with you and appreciate your perspective. 🙌
2021-05-17 09:50:00,wallstreetbets,"And even with interest rates rising as a headwind, they can still grow market share."
2021-05-17 11:46:15,wallstreetbets,Huh?
2021-05-17 09:26:23,wallstreetbets,I’m excited for this week!

2021-05-17 09:53:44,wallstreetbets,Good for you mate.🙏
2021-05-17 09:41:11,wallstreetbets,40 shares is better than no shares.
2021-05-17 09:53:10,wallstreetbets,Same man I’ve got 50 shares but the way I see it is that’s big to me. And at 50 shares the quarterly dividends almost buy me another stock
2021-05-17 10:04:03,wallstreetbets,40 shares is better than my 30 shares
2021-05-17 10:43:15,wallstreetbets,Look at this red meat eating chad baller
2021-05-17 10:02:13,wallstreetbets,Lol 37 shares
2021-05-17 16:39:07,wallstreetbets,That's more than double the dividend I got from my $AAPL shares.
2021-05-17 10:05:56,wallstreetbets,You and me both.
2021-05-17 09:55:49,wallstreetbets,A massive dividend that doesn’t even show up on the balance sheet.👀  This situation seems a tiny bit rare.
2021-05-17 12:12:10,wallstreetbets,Why do some analysts downgrade next year’s estimates so bad?
2021-05-17 10:39:16,wallstreetbets,That was my experience.
2021-05-17 13:13:50,wallstreetbets,"His name isn't Matt, please refer him to Mat Daddy."
2021-05-17 10:47:29,wallstreetbets,Best of luck.🙏
2021-05-17 12:16:53,wallstreetbets,Glad it was a easy decision
2021-05-17 09:54:42,wallstreetbets,Anything around eight dollars per share I think is a great long-term investment. And it just might be juicy short term.
2021-05-17 11:02:12,wallstreetbets,"Also, just came on board this morning. Nice to see a DD confirming my bias."
2021-05-17 10:22:17,wallstreetbets,Ditto

2021-05-17 12:13:57,wallstreetbets,"UWM guided for lower margins in Q2 as a pricing war is happening in the Wholesale channel right now. That was a big surprise for Analysts

A lot of their revenue is tied to refinance which can be rate sensitive. 

Those are the two major headwinds for you UWM right now."
2021-05-17 12:25:46,wallstreetbets,"> analysts have cut their price target 14% to US$9.46. It could also be instructive to look at the range of analyst estimates, to evaluate how different the outlier opinions are from the mean. There are some variant perceptions on UWM Holdings, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$12.00 and the most bearish at US$7.50 per share

Even after their ""Major Cut To Next Year's Estimates"", it still sounds like the stock has an asymmetric upside at its current price"
2021-05-17 10:05:35,wallstreetbets,Price action is interesting.👀
2021-05-17 10:37:02,wallstreetbets,Looks more like crashing now lol
2021-05-17 10:41:09,wallstreetbets,Good luck friend🙂
2021-05-17 12:05:46,wallstreetbets,🤞🤞
2021-05-17 13:02:18,wallstreetbets,Definitely some headwinds!
2021-05-17 19:33:28,wallstreetbets,🤞🍀
2021-05-17 13:19:28,wallstreetbets,Not sure but happy for you! Take some profits!
2021-05-17 13:20:13,wallstreetbets,I think UWM will have a larger market cap than Rocket in 3 years or so.
2021-05-17 13:20:44,wallstreetbets,I cannot. Shorting is above my pay grade.
2021-05-17 13:21:56,wallstreetbets,🤞🤞
2021-05-17 13:32:57,wallstreetbets,"Buyback will be class A shares. There is a concern that the public float won't be large enough to facilitate a healthy market. 

Not sure what the \*right\* levels are."
2021-05-17 18:16:25,wallstreetbets,"Their cost to originate is much, much, lower than any other broker. Their profitable even at 75 BPS, and the average gain on sale margin is 115-185BPS. 

They're also taking on a lot of mortgages in house and servicing them, including jumbo loans, so they can be more competitive on them. 

There's a 4 million undersupply of homes, and 1.2 million is needed just to keep up with yearly demand. So you need more than 1.2 million homes a year to start cutting into the undersupply of homes.

Millenials are aging into their prime homebuying years for the next 5 years.

You should be bullish long term too to be honest with you. I've wrote a lot of extensive DD on this company, and I even gamed out a 75BPS scenario."
2021-05-17 19:29:19,wallstreetbets,"Yeah in the earnings call CFO says they can be profitable at 75 basis points or a touch lower. I tend to believe their cost to originate is lower, especially considering their days to close is much quicker than industry average."
2021-05-17 14:43:54,wallstreetbets,🤞
2021-05-17 14:49:52,wallstreetbets,I’d be a better investor if I bought stuff then forgot about it.

2021-05-17 10:25:08,wallstreetbets,😂 it is dry. Trying to remove the hype from a hype stock for level-headed investors I guess.
2021-05-17 09:44:44,wallstreetbets,"I’d open a position but proceed with caution. But, the potential is there. I mean if you invest; you might as well invest in a company with solid business that’s printing"
2021-05-17 09:43:31,wallstreetbets,Do it
2021-05-17 09:41:29,wallstreetbets,No. I’ve gotten burned by UWMC far too many times. Don’t do it
2021-05-17 10:18:18,wallstreetbets,"i personally missed out on 100$ at open, i’d invest with your own caution and hunch. not everyone wants to see you win.

im smol time but i’m trying to get up there and learn as much as possible. i turned $5 into 50 (warren buffet status lol) and now i’m trying to multiply.

i don’t know about other people but that’s how i’ll find comfort in red days , starting with damn near nothing and making it something 😂

2021-05-17 10:01:22,wallstreetbets,Cool.
2021-05-17 10:40:48,wallstreetbets,Palantir and a terrible call option play on Open are my only other positions.
2021-05-17 10:56:50,wallstreetbets,If I could buy more I would. Its basically 90% of my portfolio right now
2021-05-17 09:52:56,wallstreetbets,"Whether you have a short or long term horizon, UWM has a little bit for everybody. Longterm is always better though"
2021-05-17 09:56:00,wallstreetbets,Yes
2021-05-17 10:55:46,wallstreetbets,"I got LEAPS for 12/21 when it was at 8.5 and degenned 05/28/21 a week ago when it was scraping 6.5.  The time premium was too low, like pennies for me not to buy on a nonsensical short.  The latter was correct, obviously, and it appears that my LEAPS are still intact."
2021-05-17 09:57:54,wallstreetbets,If you bought shares you should sleep easy.

2021-05-17 11:47:54,wallstreetbets,"I own 7,500 shares of a stock and post about it online 😂. This is the driest DD ever yet I’m a karma whore?"
2021-05-17 11:53:56,wallstreetbets,👀
2021-05-17 12:51:12,wallstreetbets,It could!
2021-05-17 12:59:37,wallstreetbets,"Interesting. 

I would think the only people selling UWM this week would be Market Makers. I suspect most investors are waiting through Friday."
2021-05-17 13:47:37,wallstreetbets,"Yeah the whole industry has a major headwind. But UWM is not the market and can increase market share in a higher margin environment. And the broker channel could grow as well. 

But maybe not. Long term you can collect the dividend and wait for the next super cycle."
2021-05-17 14:14:41,wallstreetbets,Maybe. I’m not a UWM employee but they did originate my refinance.
2021-05-17 14:44:10,wallstreetbets,🤞
2021-05-17 14:52:00,wallstreetbets,🤣 yeah it doesn’t even make sense where I put that line but I couldn’t leave it out.
2021-05-17 19:34:19,wallstreetbets,Short interest was around 13%. Shorts are betting higher interest rates will dry up the refinance market.
2021-05-17 16:22:01,wallstreetbets,Aggressive capital returns and growing market share could keep the stock price steady-to-growth in the long term.
2021-05-17 11:57:12,wallstreetbets,Bro you are cranky.
2021-05-17 10:49:51,wallstreetbets,"As a Minnesotan, can confirm they do"
2021-05-17 15:03:47,wallstreetbets,"Interest rates will hurt the market but if prices drop some in response you open up the market to even more buyers. I don't see anything slowing real estate down unless we somehow ended up with a glut of inventory, which is gonna take a long time to build up"
2021-05-17 12:09:01,wallstreetbets,Im sorry man I am soo ape that what ever I read just went down the poop shoot.
2021-05-17 12:11:50,wallstreetbets,I think he is talking about the 93% short interest who just ate a 10 percent loss within a couple hours of opening on massive catalysts.
2021-05-17 12:50:06,wallstreetbets,Will only sell for diamonds 💎
2021-05-17 10:14:38,wallstreetbets,Thank you - I would like a sandwich now.

2021-05-17 15:42:47,wallstreetbets,One possibility is that some are predicting the housing market to crash in the relatively near future

2021-05-17 19:23:24,wallstreetbets,Not Mat Daddy until I see $9.50 this week.
2021-05-17 10:46:15,wallstreetbets,Agreed
2021-05-17 19:22:56,wallstreetbets,It’s what I am here for.
2021-05-17 12:15:50,wallstreetbets,"So, the big whoop is not going to happen then?"
2021-05-17 19:24:43,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, lowest PT is 7.50 I think."
2021-05-17 10:48:30,wallstreetbets,And headed back up again. Buckle up for a ride.
2021-05-17 11:31:43,wallstreetbets,Possible 9$/shares on Friday
2021-05-17 11:15:40,wallstreetbets,What is this green I see in my portfolio? I’m confused
2021-05-17 13:22:34,wallstreetbets,Waiting to see how the week goes still a long time to expiry so theta isnt a problem yet. Was up 200% at the peak this morning. I really think we will see buys from Mat everyday until it gets back to 10$
2021-05-17 13:23:38,wallstreetbets,This is a bull play correct? Lol
2021-05-17 13:35:54,wallstreetbets,"Well, depending on the share price, they ""Could"" buy back almost half from retail"
2021-05-17 11:13:05,wallstreetbets,"Thats what I am thinking. The value is fair, I just want to exit in a month (the call I sold) or a year."
2021-05-17 10:59:21,wallstreetbets,Did it.
2021-05-17 11:09:56,wallstreetbets,"The SPACs I sold are going nowhere fast. I looked into UWMC over the weekend and think its at a fair price for a ~1yr hold right now. I do not think the fed is going to collapse the debt market by rising rates quickly. They are just going to force us to eat inflation in energy et al for a year or so while constantly manipulating the market with announcements about what they are going to talk about considering. Inflation in energy is only going to help the Biden adgenda, making renewables and more efficient infrastructure more appealing with standard market mechanics. 

I was over positioned in prospective tech and need to diversify. If there is a squeeze, great, already sold a call to lower my cost basis and cap my gain. I am here to make a little and let the gamblers take a lot (hopefully). I'll take a 20% gain on a 1 month time horizon any time. If it goes down I will hold, if it trades sideways I will sell another call, if it moons it will fall and I will take the IV crush less whatever extrinsic value the call still has."

I'm not betting in the short term, I'm waiting for $12 per share to reduce my position. Although... If it squeezes higher, I'll close my position and wait for a good reentry price."

The last three stock I bought had a good outcome, great results, they all tanked. I’m not gambling on #GME or other stuff. I’m trying to be responsible. The companies post great results. They go down.

Good results: the stock tanks

Bad results: the stock tanks

**🚀** **🚀** **🚀** **🚀** **🚀** UWMC **🚀** **🚀** **🚀** **🚀** **🚀** **🚀** **🚀**

UWMC is ready to pop!

I was in UWMC for the value play. It is a STEAL at 10$ on fundamentals anything below that is an insane deal. Even above 10 has a strong long-term argument.

Here is UWMC in a nutshell: heavily shorted, borrow costs skyrocketing, mortgage industry hit overly hard on fears of rising interest rates, the CEO Ishiba announces a 300M stock buyback, and shorts are QUAKING. UP 6% in premarket following being up 1-2% Friday. This puts at starting at $8 Monday with $9 being a CRITICAL Friday target for us.

All UWMC needs is a little unexpected retail buying pressure and it POPS! In truth this is not just a short squeeze, its multiple plays rolled into one. We have retail buying hype train going (obviously, look at all the WSB posts here posted below), short-squeeze due to high cost of borrow, Gamma squeeze due to the MASSIVE options interest, 300M stock buyback by CEO to scare off the shorts, an unfair post-earnings plunge, plus good-ole\` company doing good things (making money).

We coming back for some of our loyal bagholders that have been holding UWMC since the last train to $14, hey guys remember to take profit this time ;)

**🚀** **🚀** **🚀** **🚀** **🚀** UWMC **🚀** **🚀** **🚀** **🚀** **🚀** **🚀** **🚀Short Squeeze**.Short borrow costs skyrocketed from 30% to over 93% in a few hours on Friday: They cannot keep shorting at this price. It is now cost-prohibitive to use more shorts to keep the price low. The normal dirty tricks triple in price so become less-used. Shorts use this borrow price to determine feasibility and 93% is obviously unfeasible, THEY WILL COVER. Once one group starts covering and causes a spike, other shorts will rush to do the same.

It's a prisoner's dilemma and HF's want to cut each other's throats just as much as ours. Let's let them!!!

**🚀** **🚀** **🚀** **🚀** **🚀** UWMC **🚀** **🚀** **🚀** **🚀** **🚀** **🚀** **🚀Gamma squeeze:**[https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/uwmc/options](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/uwmc/options)

Many of these 7.50,9. 10, and 12 are OTM or barely ITM. and an early week spike to put 9c ITM would force MM's to hedge to delta-neutral...further pushing 10c and 12.50 c into hedge territory. This can quickly cause things to spiral out of control for shorts.

Stock BuyBack,

Ishbia is going to war with the shorts and his weapon of choice is a 300M stock buyback (similar to RKT's special dividend for the same purpose). The buyback could have started happening as early as May 11th.

Most of the float is owned by institutions and insiders so this buyback puts increased pressure of a heavily shorted (13%+) and heavily held float pool.

Retail is gorging on the float, institutions are holding the float, and Ishbia is buying the free float up. This is a recipe for ROCKET FUEL. WIth shorts paying 93%, they will stop shorting so the shares we are buying are REAL, not synthetic.

Make them buy real shares, from us, at 20$ each.

**🚀** **🚀** **🚀** **🚀** **🚀** UWMC **🚀** **🚀** **🚀** **🚀** **🚀** **🚀** \*\*🚀UWMC is a good company, not just a memestock:\*\*UWMC is a good company that pays a good dividend, has a good CEO, and is the king of B2B mortgage refinance.

I am in UWMC for the long-term VALUE-PLAY and like the stock. I like the company., I like the CEO. I like the market position. I like the value. I ilke the stock.

I am loading up on 6/18 8c options. Options are important as we move up to force MM's to buy to remain market neutral.

Options do not pay unless we buy shares, so I suggest splitting half/half to each. options can cause MM's to balance risk and lead to large upswings but this cannot happen without buying pressure and the underlying spiking to necessitate balancing risk, which means we need to buy stocks as well.

Options are good for Gamma Squeeze/MM's balance buys (and profit) but shares are needed to keep the underlying JOOSED and keep those options deep ITM.

MIX IT UP!

This is the final call for the UWMC tendie train so get your fucking tickets and remember; Gravy costs extra,

TL;DR: **🚀** **🚀** **🚀** **🚀** **🚀** UWMC **🚀** **🚀** **🚀** **🚀** **🚀** **🚀** **🚀** TO THA MOON!

2021-05-17 09:22:51,wallstreetbets,"2 questions.

1. How many of those calls are sold naked? My guess is not as many as you'd think. I personally sold some $11 CC's as a way to lower my cost basis. Plenty of others did the same. Some don't even own shares and went with the PMCC strategy. Not every call needs to be hedged because they already are.

2. Does the interest rate to short a stock apply retroactively or just to new positions looking to short? I suspect it's for new positions looking to short. The brave souls who decided to short this stock at $7 are certainly dumb... But if they are only paying a few percent interest and they trust their DD, they may be able to avoid margin call long enough to see their thesis through without worrying about borrowing costs."

2021-05-17 13:42:56,wallstreetbets,"sorry to rain on your parade but this isnt going to short squeeze on a fundamentally mediocre  company with like 10% short interest, , the company books go back to 2019 in which it had a net losses and negative cashflows from operations, its essentially a money black hole, It may be a short term buy because they declared a buyback and have the means to do so with the cashflows from stock issuance, although once they buy back the shares with their cash pile they are back to mediocre business, its a mortgage lending company, its a short term value buy, even then it is questionable since I think the share buyback is already priced in. They have been in business since 1986 only recently going public so there's hope there, but this isnt GameStop and there is no catalyst to send this company to the moon, maybe if the market over reacts and sends this stock plummeting will there be a good buying opportunity and short squeeze"

Seems not fair. Let's kick their asses!"
2021-05-17 09:42:17,wallstreetbets,UWMC has been on the threshold securities list (meaning failures-to-deliver) for weeks. That list is designed to detect naked short activity. It's the only stock (not ETF) I've seen on there that long since GME.
2021-05-17 10:25:40,wallstreetbets,"1. UWMC's last failure to deliver report had over 300k shares fail to deliver.  that usually indicates a large naked short interest.  they don't usually change their strategy. 
2. The borrow fee occurs retroactively and gets charged to them at the end of the  trading day.  I don't think the interest rate will scare them off to be honest... its more of an indicator of how scarce the shares avail to short are for UWMC.  High short interest means there's a heavy direct short position, once those are gone it forces them to add to naked shorts."
2021-05-17 10:26:10,wallstreetbets,"> Does the interest rate to short a stock apply retroactively or just to new positions looking to short?

You phrased that wrong. Retroactively is not the right term.

The interest rate applies to all borrowed stock by market close. Whether you opened that short position today, or a few days ago. Every day that you are short you are charged the day rate.

Every day that rate can go up or down, and you are charged the rate at market close."
2021-05-17 09:31:27,wallstreetbets,"It only applies to new short positions.   


However, it also takes away an important tool to push the price down; shorting the stock to ensure your previous shorts remain profitable.   


WIthout retail pressure, sure they don't need to short more.   


However when a shorted stock faces some buy pressure they just short more to scare off more investors, new and existing.   


WIthout the ability to continue shorting a little buy pressure forces them to retreat...or pay 98% to try and shake investors off (expensive proposition)"

2021-05-17 14:28:03,wallstreetbets,The 100 shares from the 5c are a long term hold I just wanted to lock in this price before it goes to 9-10.  And after that it’ll be Monthly CCs deep OTM and raking in dividends for the next 10 years.  I just started selling CCs and I like a 5% dividend yield (assuming 8$ share price) to combine with CC revenue.

2021-05-17 10:01:33,wallstreetbets,Your likely right on all of the above but the game changer is/will be the buyback pressure looming over the Shortz all week.  Gonna be a wild ride into the Friday sunset!
2021-05-17 11:11:52,wallstreetbets,A lot of reasons. GME isn't on that list anymore. GME doesn't have a buyback or dividend coming up. GME shorts aren't paying crazy fees anymore.

2021-05-17 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Monday Morning Analysis on $WELL $WLYYF Morning everyone, with the market acting the way it currently is I decided to do another TA on WELL Health.

Step 1 for me is zooming out. Despite the current market WELL actually held up quite strong - Beautiful Weekly close wicked just above the 20day SMA forming a nice support (Double bottom) in this 6.20 -8.20 channel. If we can snap this losing streak I think that might be our immediate next stop.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1w7ibai2joz61.png?width=1344&format=png&auto=webp&s=83f35051fc0b07980181b14bdad493dfc7aa4958

Stochastic's oversold and the RSI is closely following. On a shorter time frame we can see that bulls finished the Friday session off strong positioning us in a nice spot technically as we are sitting on the 20day SMA.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wqisl7e4joz61.png?width=1342&format=png&auto=webp&s=fd01cd8896624817e553901bac203aec1b206adc

Now obviously Im looking at this week so let's look at the last week.

If we can open above 6.9 (50day SMA) I think we can close around that 7.14 (200day SMA) level which should line us up for that move out of the $6-$8 range and into the $10s and beyond.

Now funny enough what actually has me the most bullish this morning is looking at Friday alone. Selling pressure was suppressed by the bulls and it closed right near HOD above all major resistances.

2021-05-17 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$200K all-in because I believe that $UWMC is undervalued. CEO agreed undervalued and declared a buyback to retire class A float (only class that gets dividends). BULLISH trend this week!  

I  have shared my thoughts on UWMC in past. The company announced Q1  earnings and while they look like they are below expectations it was  explained by the CEO that because of the speed of their execution, their  results are reflective of the higher rate environment already while  competitors are lagged.

During    the Q4 2020 earnings call he  had mused about options that would be on    the stable, special dividend,  buyback or raising the dividend.

**Feb Q4 Earnings Quote:**

The     Board did approve a dividend, a $0.10 quarterly dividend to be  paid    on  April 6 for all shareholders of record as of March 10. **We expect  this to be a regular quarterly dividend**.

And     so you guys know how we're thinking about this. Our balance sheet   is  a   fortress. And our current liquidity position is very strong, and    we   have access to the capital markets as well. The way we think  about   this   going forward is we're producing a lot of cash. We're  going to   maybe   be more profitable than some expected and be very  successful in   2021.   And **if we have excess cash that I and the Board deem is too much,  we will be delivering that back**. And whether we have to **change     the  dividend in the future, as in raise it or a special dividend,     those  things are definitely on the table or even buying back shares**.

**May Q1 Earnings Quote:**

As     you saw in our release, the Board approved our quarterly dividend of      $0.10 to consistently deliver money back to our shareholders for a      record date on June 10 and payable July 6. The Board and I always  **explored increasing the dividend actually or looking at a special  dividend or a share buyback program**. As you guys have seen, we **concluded      share buyback was the best use of our capital to reward   shareholders.    We announced the authorization of $300 million share   buyback over the    next 24 months**.  And **quite honestly, with where the share price is, it's a great opportunity for us to continue to buy that**.

**Then in answering a question from an analyst**

Doug    Harter -  Great. And then just in terms of capital return, you    mentioned sort of  the float. I  guess just how are you thinking about    kind of **how much of  the float  you'd be willing to take out and pacing around share  repurchase**?

Mat Ishbia -  Yes, Doug. So I'm learning these rules as we go **because at this stock  price, I'm a buyer, right**?    And so we'll buy shares as soon as tomorrow, I  think, as our legal    teams say we're allowed to do. And so I don't know  how many I can buy    and what I can do, but I'm very conscientious of the  float.  If the    float was not a concern, **we'd be more aggressive**. However,  **we     have authorization from the Board to buy up to $300 million, and I'm      going to take advantage of that opportunity while being  conscientious     of our partners in the float.**

TL/DR:     UWMC and their board have been looking at ways to give back to     shareholders. Instead of a short term cash out, they decided on a     buyback that they are planning to exercise immediately on so that they     can retire shares while the SP is low. They will NOT buy so much that   it   will ruin their float % for Russell. The CEO is aggressive, has    approval to spend $300 and he's going to take FULL advantage.  The CEO has stated he is a BUYER! They are  not   waiting, it's being deployed now.

Disclosure I am still in long position with 25K  at 8.39 USD shares of UWMC

This stock won't moon, so don't buy if you expect that, BUT it could realistically trade around 9-10 right before the ex-dividend date in early June. It currently pays .10 cents a share per quarter, so even if it stays flat you can at least collect the nice dividend."

I do not agree with the *short squeeze* narrative that I am seeing in comments here and elsewhere because I don't believe the volume on the buy side will be there to propel such an event but if it happens that would just be icing on an already delicious cake.  But just like cake it takes some time to make so I'm patiently waiting to enjoy a few slices."

2021-05-17 13:42:03,wallstreetbets,"introducing a new quarterly dividend on non-class-a shares is a fairly bullish signal. buyback/retiring the float of the class A share is a strange move to do simultaneously. 

those are two huge expenditures. 

I haven't done the research, but do earnings support both the buyback and quarterly dividend?

Are earnings stable enough to support dividend growth over the longer term? Or will this incur debt over time and be cut/reduced? 

this seems like a transition period for this investment from growth to dividend and those can be rocky."

Just like 1990

Split the difference and say 25% a year your 200k in 10 years you have over $1.8 million. 20 yrs it's over $17 million.  Again, I am not knocking here.  I do hope all my fellow traders/investors make money. I just don't know how one can have peace of mind and sleep at night.

The final call was to buy back all the A series, so they didn't have to publically admit they could no longer afford to pay a dividend in such a paranoid time.

2021-05-17 10:43:16,wallstreetbets,"This stock is definitely undervalued and shares are a nice buy and hold (I'm in at 7.19) but this is going to trade like every meme stock which is gain after hours because idiots like us get off work have some free time, gain at market open because we're not quite working yet then lose 50% of open gains or more by 11am because we all stop paying attention to work our 9-5s. That being said options can print if you execute trades at the right time. my $9c were up thousands at 10am because of price pressure. Unlikely to make that 100x or 500x money unless institutions decide they want to pile in but if you're paying attention theres margin to be made trading calls intraday."

2021-05-17 10:34:32,wallstreetbets,"There is a difference though.  Every CEO says their stock is undervalued.  If a CEO gets approval for buybacks they actually believe it is undervalued.  UWMC makes solid profits, and will continue even as the mortgage market dips, which is why they pay solid dividends.  The buyback reduces the money they have to pay to shareholders in dividends, which ultimately means more profits for the company which the CEO currently owns over 90% of.  His actions actually show he believes it is undervalued, it isn't just words."
2021-05-17 14:10:22,wallstreetbets,Yeah that worked out great for RKT when Jay Farner said 40$ was still too low. Lmao. Idk where these people come from or get their ideas.

2021-05-17 10:45:46,wallstreetbets,"Its a different play. Im looking at it as a specific play on a portion of an industry. The CEO defends his sp and they pay dividends regularly at 5-6% annual yield. With cc, I felt it was an income stream at worst.

2021-05-17 12:45:32,wallstreetbets,"Its a discussion. Plenty of DD done by others. I have alot of respect for the AMC holders that arent leaving their ppl behind. This is not a gamma thing.

Its about an opportunity for UWMC to cut up 40% of available float, reducing dividend costs or allowing them pay more to each share in the future.

Its about breaking the low volume and buying back up the levels.

Its about 5-6% yield annually."

2021-05-17 10:29:05,wallstreetbets,"I think a lot of the short squeeze narrative relies on the buyback all happening this week, at least to the 25% daily volume limit.  I don't think that will realistically happen, because they have two years to complete the buyback and I think they will buy the dips just like the rest of us.  That said, there is potential for a gamma squeeze, and that could trigger shorts to exit which would bring the short squeeze on the table.  But I think it has a lot of ifs to get that far.

I like the stock for it's long term potential, but I've been buying the constant dips for months now and I wouldn't mind exiting some of my position for a nice return now.  52% of my portfolio in one stock is too much for my blood."

2021-05-17 08:52:57,wallstreetbets,If it breaks 13-15 definitely sell. Your doubling your money. That is always a good day. Im in it for long term dividends so uwmc will always be in my portfolio. Its yield is very good.

2021-05-17 10:21:16,wallstreetbets,"Its real in that it could perform less the q4 but in this market. Part of the stimulus will be to invest in housing. How do I know this? In Canada we have had industrial challenges for along time. Only finance is going strong. Tech is weakend and mfg is dying because of buy america.

Currently 40% of canada's gdp is tied to housing market. Its still going and realestate is at $1000-1500 a sqft in major cities. The US has this also, my read is that with generational low rates every american will buy a house now. Its possible and wfh/remote means all areas will see housing go up. Major cities will be stable because you have investors able to hold.

Uwmc is intrinsically tied to the housing market and as brokers do better, and new unemployed go into realestate as entrepreneurs, there will be a surge in new brokers/agents/buy and sell."
2021-05-17 15:20:08,wallstreetbets,Except in your analogy a dude would then eat his own shit and enjoy it. Because Matty boy is doing 300 mil buy back and retiring the shares...aka putting his money where his mouth is.

2021-05-17 14:11:28,wallstreetbets,~90% of brokers pledged to stay with uwm over others like rkt.
2021-05-17 11:25:06,wallstreetbets,Not from what the call said. Everyone declared victory. It will be a growing pie in my opinion it secures the POV that they are the wholesaler on their side. More brokers will trust them. Ultimately it is about price and speed. UWMC wins on speed and will match or beat on price.
2021-05-17 08:41:17,wallstreetbets,"Haha yeah but the way I see this is its like dividend stock. So at worst, I will be able to gain on long term CC, yield and fx"

2021-05-17 11:37:11,wallstreetbets,Do you know what they do? Its 5-6% yield at regular annualized dividends payout. You should see how many of wsb pay out? Not that many at all. I see this same as Ark. They have a vision and go for it. UWMC had a vision to be the biggest broker provider and biggest mortgage lender. I can see their path and the benefits it will bring.

Direct rival and the prices are diverging, hmm... I don't short RKT but you're making it sound tempting.

Didn't Ishbia's ultimatum only affect RKT and Fairway? Lol. People have plenty of lenders to choose from. Don't believe every ambulance chaser article you see. UWMC been leading wholesaler for years, they have access to the finest legal teams in the world. You really think you figured out some secret that no one else knows?"

2021-05-17 11:33:51,wallstreetbets,I aim for my portfolio to have a 7% return a year. And i will reinvest. This yield is amazing for me and i feel it will have growth in sp tied to market growth. I am looking to 2022++ at least for 75% of this holding. I need to rebalance for risk long term would take 25% at profit based on near term gain

2021-05-17 10:51:52,wallstreetbets,"I agree which is why I dont do options. My method is different. Never been looking for 100x im just sharing my support and why I made this decision.

US housing will grow in importance as others fall/crippled. I believe there will be incredible investment from foreign capital all because the US has the most ppl vaccinated. Buy America will prevail, economy will recover faster and citizens will have confidence to buy/upgrade their houses. Remote WFH means they will now spread out, spend in historically stagnant housing markets.

As areas experience metro growth, new entrepreneurs will join as RE agents, flippers, and Brokers. UWMC is a pureplay mortgage at record close times and strong broker position. I expect brokers to dominate and therefore UWMC to appreciate long term.

UWMC is undervalued, ceo will support and he has looked at special div, raising div every single time he talks on earnings call."
2021-05-17 11:58:40,wallstreetbets,"They have said that for many places. London, hongkong, ny, toronto, vancouver. Many years, its done nothing but increase. US has the most mobility of workforce I have ever seen. Businesses will not be looking to weigh themselves down with long term leases for sqft that they dont need. Imagine how much of a benefit young workers will get if they dont have to pay high rents just to come into office every day. I see this being the new reality"
2021-05-17 13:02:39,wallstreetbets,"Normally that might be the case however we are really overpopulated and thats only going to get worse, especially with the open borders issue, and billionaires, china, reits, and others buying up huge plots of land and holding.  The housing market is going to become renters market with big corporations just holding and never letting go."
2021-05-17 14:50:19,wallstreetbets,Depends on if you see a 5% annual yield as a bag or not? Regular bag of cash is ok to me
2021-05-17 16:01:43,wallstreetbets,He's not wrong. UWMC made me easy money today.
2021-05-17 12:42:30,wallstreetbets,And Sanjay. There is no greyish CEO WTF.
2021-05-17 13:26:32,wallstreetbets,Getting approval for buybacks does not always mean they believe it’s undervalued. The CEO and Board are likely heavily compensated with stock or incentive plans based on stock performance and want the price to drive up.
2021-05-17 15:25:44,wallstreetbets,wait the CEO holds 90% and then you think whatever he suggested to the board may get rejected! FO

even the bulls on that stock dropped their estimates by like 50% in the past 3 months"
2021-05-17 10:58:11,wallstreetbets,"Are people making a lot of money in the housing market? 

This is my opinion when it comes to the real estate/construction market right now. I believe their will be a sudden huge crash due to the price of materials( Lumber, Steel, and Plastics). I’ve experienced truss prices in 6 months triple in price and lumber yards are only buying limited quantities of lumber because they do not want to be stuck with very expensive material that they would have to sell at a loss when the house market does crash. 

I work in commercial/industrial construction and have experienced material shortages and even rationing. My dad runs a residential construction business and say it’s crazy that people are still building. 

But I do think when the market does crash and prices come back down it will ramp up very quickly because people will want to get a bargain on material prices after witnessing the today’s current prices. 

I also find it funny how people are thinking they are gonna be rich when they sell their house and go to build a new one and are so surprised how much it cost. Unless you have a second house to live or are moving to a rural area where land is cheaper it is not worth selling right now. 

I guess you could argue interest rates being so low it’s worth it."

2021-05-17 12:57:21,wallstreetbets,Doesn’t change the analysts consensus 🤷‍♂️
2021-05-17 19:47:22,wallstreetbets,"Analyst consensus means the average of those four analysts. So $9.46 is the average of the four and we don’t know the split. All we do know is that all four analysts downgraded their forecast which means they lowered the number they thought it would be. 

Is it 1 analysts that is high, maybe $15 and the other 3 are lower at say $8? That would make a consensus of $9.75. There are a lot of ways they could split it up and this is partially how generated try to confuse things by leaving out important details. For example, GME has a consensus of $45 which is there because Jeffries $175 estimate. 

Don’t just look at $9.46"
2021-05-17 10:23:52,wallstreetbets,"LOL, dividends don’t mean shit if you lost 20%+ over the last year. Best dividend yield is like 5%. Simple math"

I live just outside of Toronto and a lot of my friends and neighbours are selling their properties because they want to cash in on the market. But unless you’re moving somewhere else where the market isnt so hot or you get a deal on materials if youre planning to build, The over-asking you capitalize on when you sell is just gonna be put back towards the house you’re building or buying which is just as inflated. You’re getting more money when you sell, but you’re spending more money when you buy."

2021-05-17 11:30:48,wallstreetbets,2000 here and growing!
2021-05-17 12:04:01,wallstreetbets,I just averaged down!
2021-05-17 11:56:23,wallstreetbets,I checked Robinhood just now and according to their analysts 83% have bought and 18 are holding and 0 have sold and if this put in 200k then...maybe he onto something
2021-05-17 16:13:03,wallstreetbets,"Yes, we are in 2007 again. Sure some of you will get out in time but the rest...."
2021-05-17 16:36:11,wallstreetbets,Ill believe it when I see it. This stinks of trap but you do you
2021-05-17 10:36:48,wallstreetbets,"I am not really looking at this as a squeeze. If it really runs, I will sell a portion otherwise i am happy hold as a cash flow in my retirement fund"
2021-05-17 12:14:10,wallstreetbets,Yes please! Nice and tight.
2021-05-17 13:37:31,wallstreetbets,Bought puts cause I think you are a bot and this sub is a joke at this point
2021-05-17 09:31:09,wallstreetbets,"For anyone seeing this- $15 is crazy, $35 is not happening within a week. Don't be caught bagholding."
2021-05-17 09:10:49,wallstreetbets,Oh wow!
2021-05-17 16:06:48,wallstreetbets,"Pay their workers shit?  I'm in.  This is the $WMT, $TSLA, $AMZN of finance."
2021-05-17 16:38:34,wallstreetbets,its 90 million shares in t he float you retard
2021-05-17 11:52:02,wallstreetbets,Lol no. I know what your trying to say
2021-05-17 13:55:53,wallstreetbets,Yes that way
2021-05-17 13:39:02,wallstreetbets,This time it will be the govt.
2021-05-17 14:51:46,wallstreetbets,My avg is 8's  honestly I thought this was a good level. It was pushed down artificially.
2021-05-17 17:14:25,wallstreetbets,"back to 10 near term and up to 12-15. Alot of the near term pressure is because of industry macro and pessimism. I just saw that US 30 year mortgage rates dropped again for a 2nd week to $2.94% (source: bloomberg) that's record lows and we are now in Q2. Plenty of volume and activity to come in my opinion. 

&#x200B;

Please do your own DD's. Everyone should read and formulate their own opinions at all times."
2021-05-17 11:09:58,wallstreetbets,Yep can see your point!
2021-05-17 11:23:19,wallstreetbets,"And they will be able to move to cheaper places because WFH is acceptable now. That will make places increase in price. Spread out all the wealth instead of it being concentrated. Ppl are looking for places to invest their money, housing/land is where it will be if ppl are afraid of inflation"
2021-05-17 13:41:23,wallstreetbets,Yes but the statement is incorrect. Don’t be misled that the CEO wanting a buyback means the stock is undervalued.
2021-05-17 12:29:08,wallstreetbets,Yes that’s me... new investor that got duped into this... I guess I had to start somewhere... what’s your story? Maybe in 3 hrs I’ll be as cool as you
2021-05-17 16:00:14,wallstreetbets,What sparked using a bot like name? Sounds like a bad randomized name on Xbox live lmao
2021-05-17 14:01:44,wallstreetbets,"Lol yes. Reddit in general is a disgusting cesspool (wsb is OK, used to better), b/c of this I've never had an account survive for very long. If I am a bot however, then A) bots these days have gotten damn good or B) you don't actually know what a bot is."
2021-05-17 17:45:56,wallstreetbets,These retards think buying SPY is a distraction from GME lol
2021-05-17 16:59:41,wallstreetbets,Just answering the question. Down boy.
2021-05-17 17:40:09,wallstreetbets,"Just answering the question and adding my 2 cents. I'll let my therapist know you said hi lmao.

My position: Your mum's bum every single night."
2021-05-17 18:42:25,wallstreetbets,"Okay, but if we are looking at potential/fundamentals/short interest why are you not looking at GME? You are literally pushing for a random no name stock. 

While the real play is still in action?"
2021-05-17 13:35:16,wallstreetbets,"But you're almost invariably going to buy a better house than you were in, and the difference in interest paid over the length of the loan is going to save far more money for most people than the increase in the price of the property over ""normal times."" Right now in my city, a house that would normally go for about 300k 10 years ago is now going for like 375k, but 10 years ago your interest rate might have been 6% or more. Right now it is 3% or less depending on credit and length of loan. Over 30 years, that's a lot of money."
2021-05-17 15:40:35,wallstreetbets,"I guess, but I get 94% of the profit and only have to put 20% of the purchase price at a really low interest rate 🤯"

2021-05-17 09:01:56,wallstreetbets,Wasn’t talking about those benefits. ;)
2021-05-17 13:30:54,wallstreetbets,Oh teach me young wise one. I’ll return in a few days to find you’ve packed up and crawled back to your mommas house. Thanks for the donation.
2021-05-17 12:02:43,wallstreetbets,I just bought some more at 7.98!  Hope to get more before it gets into the double digits
2021-05-17 13:14:08,wallstreetbets,Best of lick
2021-05-17 14:39:35,wallstreetbets,Yeah robinhood analysts are usually recommending the opposite of a good gameplan.
2021-05-17 12:02:49,wallstreetbets,For me in Monkey language: Buy now?  Thanks!
2021-05-17 12:01:32,wallstreetbets,I don't think it is socially acceptable to use the r-word here..
2021-05-17 12:22:28,wallstreetbets,You got it
2021-05-17 13:40:56,wallstreetbets,"With the IV can’t really go wrong either way, best of luck to us all. Beep boop bop 🤖"
2021-05-17 09:58:43,wallstreetbets,Sorry I don't mean 35 eow but if people hold strong and nakeds have to cover I belive 35 is entirely possible with the squeeze
2021-05-17 16:44:09,wallstreetbets,Wow man take a step away from reddit and get laid bro. That's alot of anger
2021-05-17 15:03:43,wallstreetbets,"If you have a calculator you can see it's undervalued for yourself.  Either way, share buyback is going to provide a rising floor and the massive number of short sellers will have a strong incentive to cover."
2021-05-17 12:34:20,wallstreetbets,If you're new then why are you bothering posting about stocks you know nothing about? Buy some growth ETFs and get off the hype train.
2021-05-17 17:36:16,wallstreetbets,I'm real! Just look at my name! REAL BOY 69420
2021-05-17 16:18:51,wallstreetbets,sounds like something a bot would say
2021-05-17 19:04:25,wallstreetbets,"I’m not pushing anything. I haven’t made any posts promoting the stock. I established a position in it before the increase in attention from WSB. I already rode the GME train, I did fine. My GME position was established last year and closed earlier this year. As entertaining as it is seeing hordes of gamblers constantly feed their addiction and provide each other with confirmation bias, I hit my profit target and exited. 

I entered a position with UWMC because of technicals combined with the extremely high short interest. Just because you haven’t heard of a stock doesn’t mean it doesn’t have potential or interest from other people. The universe is larger than two stocks. If you dedicate your trading existence to simply following what gambling addict claim to be doing on Reddit, you deserve the result. 

While true short squeezes are rare, there can be substantial upward pressure from very high short interest. It can provide opportunity if the entry point is low enough and the short interest is high enough. In the past 5 days, UWMC has gained over 20%, for example. And that’s without really much covering by the shorts. Why? Look at their ER and the analysis with it. Not OP’s post here, but legitimate analysis. Plus, it pays a dividend very soon. 

TLDR; the company is in the process of buying back substantial shares of stock, the ER was very good, short sellers have likely oversold their positions, the cost to borrow shares (if you can find them) is astronomical, and I like money. I use that money to make more money by finding opportunities. If you keep expecting the same play on the same stock to just keep repeating itself (and aren’t actually operating off a legitimate technical basis or algorithm-driven trading), then hard lessons will be learned. There is a substantial difference between a trader and a gambler constantly yoloing or someone who has whatever pittance they call a yolo tied up on a meme stock for months on end instead of actually making that money do work for you."
2021-05-17 16:51:35,wallstreetbets,"Aha! The only difference is, I’m assuming you’re in the US, if you lock down a specific interest rate, say 1.7% over a 30 year mortgage, that’s your interest rate for those 30 years before it’s adjusted again. In Canada, we have the same thing, however, even though it’s priced with the “intent” to be paid over 20 or 30 years, that interest rate is only applicable for 5 years before its adjusted again. 

And as it is throughout North America, interest rates are the lowest they’ve been in a long time, but if the rates go up, and you’re at the start of your home owning journey, (in Canada) you’ll only have the luxury of a low interest rate for the first 5 years. Weird, but that’s just how it’s done."
2021-05-17 09:11:16,wallstreetbets,Lol hahaa
2021-05-17 12:09:15,wallstreetbets,"These are bots mate, no one on their right mind uses Robinhood anymore."
2021-05-17 10:07:06,wallstreetbets,"It may be, but I think that $35 is more possible long term. I can't see it going beyond $21 or more on a squeeze (and more likely I don't see anything much more than $15 by EoW)"
2021-05-17 10:58:05,wallstreetbets,jesus christ dude not every stock is GME get out of here with this “hold the line!” bullshit
2021-05-17 15:05:03,wallstreetbets,I’ve got a calculator. I’m holding shares. Statement is still incorrect.
2021-05-17 12:46:50,wallstreetbets,"The hype train got me a house, a mining farm and a rapidly receding hairline."
2021-05-17 14:01:15,wallstreetbets,Idk... maybe because I was bored and my cash just a sits in the bank... you do you and I’ll do me... do I sense you have some Shitty bags you are holding and I’m the punch character? At any rate thanks for your response... I’ll update my 4K positions soon
2021-05-17 19:33:35,wallstreetbets,"Oh my, I didn't realize there were no fixed rates elsewhere. Yeah, my entire everything I said is based on interest rates being fixed. My wife and I just closed on a new house on Friday with 2.75% fixed, and intend to pay it off in like 1/3 of the expected length of the loan, so it would be very hard for this to not be a good move financially for us."

2021-05-17 13:05:04,wallstreetbets,"I like the honesty, and I think this should be the big takeaway ha.

Uwmc already hit a peak earlier this year, just like the other meme stocks. Could be bag holding if people are buying in now. Just my thought. DD aside. There's manipulation going on."

2021-05-17 08:02:01,wallstreetbets,So do I buy ATT or Discovery? Or ViaC?
2021-05-17 08:54:47,wallstreetbets,HBO Max coupled with Discovery Plus is an insane content portfolio. Plus cutting all the fat and deleveraging. Valuation is the question.
2021-05-17 11:24:55,wallstreetbets,2 mins silence for whoever bought in pre-market 😑
2021-05-17 08:49:07,wallstreetbets,DISCA 🚀🚀🚀
2021-05-17 08:53:44,wallstreetbets,Discovery is 29% of a $100B market cap on the low end. Should be trading double last close.
2021-05-17 14:05:17,wallstreetbets,"u/lvlatthevv talking about valuation have seen the 8k released this morning? It says the new Co. will have a 20bn expected free cash flow.  


Entreprise Value will be10 time this amount minus debt of the two companies:  


20bn x 10 = 200bn Entreprise Value  


Minus:  
\- Net debt warner $43bn

\- Net debt DISCA $15bn

=> Market Value $142bn  


8k also says that DISCA holder will have 29% of the new co. shares which 41bn (142\*0.29)

Curerent share outstanding = 505 millions

41bn / 505m = $81 $DISCA 🚀🚀🚀🚀"

2021-05-17 17:52:50,wallstreetbets,"Exactly, but the dip"
2021-05-17 14:37:45,wallstreetbets,"I agree with a valuation around $80 share if not >$100

But I think you misread the cash flow number. Newco should have cash flow of about $10B at time of merger. Legacy AT&T will have cash flow of $20B.

That said, realization of synergies and trimming of fat will push CF for newco higher."

2021-05-17 13:36:18,wallstreetbets,Neither. $VIAC looks much better now that we know the deal details

2021-05-17 13:30:32,wallstreetbets,What's new
2021-05-17 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,EU and U.S. to start talks that could end steel tariffs imposed during Trump presidency 
2021-05-17 06:55:04,wallstreetbets,IS THIS GOOD OR BAD FOR STEEL GANG
2021-05-17 07:00:57,wallstreetbets,What are our russian steel tickers
2021-05-17 08:06:06,wallstreetbets,This isn't a political post - it has ramifications for the economy.
2021-05-17 11:48:23,wallstreetbets,back to shitty foreign steel :(
2021-05-17 06:58:25,wallstreetbets,Just let everyone else make a buck off the American people... no worries the average joe will get the bill at the end of the year.  Get ready for the dollar to be worthless and your taxes to take the place if tariffs
2021-05-17 12:54:32,wallstreetbets,"I'm not a US citizen but the US should impose high tariffs on ALL nations that run trade surpluses on it. Force all these nations to import more US production.

2021-05-17 16:29:09,wallstreetbets,Is he trying to put every American out of work?
2021-05-17 06:56:47,wallstreetbets,Great for foreign steel
2021-05-17 06:57:09,wallstreetbets,Looks bad. Taking down a 25% tariff on eurosteel
2021-05-17 06:56:59,wallstreetbets,Good for MT bad for US steel companies in the short term but long term doesn’t really matter
2021-05-17 06:57:05,wallstreetbets,"Short-term I think there should be a spike in metals off of this, longer-term I’d wait to see whether the talks go anywhere."
2021-05-17 13:04:30,wallstreetbets,"Short term, no change due to current trans atlantic shipping bottlenecks. Long term... TBD."
2021-05-17 17:08:21,wallstreetbets,"Bad. Tariffs are put of what's forcing the general price of steel up. Its not the whole story, but steel manufacturers in the US will be hurt by this, and Europe will probably come out ahead."

2021-05-17 08:12:33,wallstreetbets,"What the fuck are you talking about. Steel tariffs are only good for the steel industry, they make goods for the rest of us more expensive."
2021-05-17 07:00:50,wallstreetbets,There would be other industries seeing reduced export tariffs to euroland. It all balances and it depends on which scope you view it from.
2021-05-17 11:49:01,wallstreetbets,please indicate to me how these tariffs have helped you directly

2021-05-17 16:32:38,wallstreetbets,Sounds like extortion
2021-05-17 16:26:03,wallstreetbets,Swedish steel is far more superior

2021-05-17 12:55:49,wallstreetbets,Section 232 tariffs are an extremely small portion of existing tariffs against Chinese steel. Check current anti-dumping and countervailing duties. These are the ones having a major impact and Biden Admin. Can’t/won’t touch those.
2021-05-17 09:32:54,wallstreetbets,Not EVERYthING - just the shitty things
2021-05-17 09:00:55,wallstreetbets,AS you can see it's working perfectly.  Just about every commodity is higher. Aren't you so proud of Biden yet?

2021-05-17 10:47:43,wallstreetbets,"You, like Trump, do not know how tariffs work 🤦🏼‍♂️"
2021-05-17 07:12:50,wallstreetbets,The supply chain cost just soared in the trans atlantic trade lane (apperently it was uneffected until resently) so US steel companies still hold a price advantage.
2021-05-17 07:06:18,wallstreetbets,"Might be good for industries that use a lot of steel. Auto, construction, appliances etc."
2021-05-17 14:12:36,wallstreetbets,"Having once lived near a steel plant that is now an Amazon fulfillment center, I've learned that things that are billed as bad in the short term for US steel companies mean that they would be bad for steel companies in the long term too, but those steel companies don't have long to live."
2021-05-17 17:29:20,wallstreetbets,"This long term short term thinking may apply to the company, but not the share. Information like this gets priced in immediately as companies are valued on long term discounted cash flows. Example: Analysts/quants will estimate a x% probability of tariffs to come down and the effect it will have on long term DCF. using inhouse models The probability will be adjusted based on news.

Long story short, big boys price these things in immediately and act accordingly (sell or short in this case)."
2021-05-17 13:50:06,wallstreetbets,bet. Anything But Chinese steel.
2021-05-17 16:28:43,wallstreetbets,By increasing the price tag of European steel?
2021-05-17 10:51:59,wallstreetbets,Exactly!!  the cost of said tariffs are ALWAYS placed upon the consumer.  Not to make it political but the tariffs trump put on china are simply offset by charging us more.  It doesnt hurt china like trump seemed to think- it hurts Americans.
2021-05-17 08:27:43,wallstreetbets,"It’s a matter of national security, the United States needs a robust Steel industry in case of supply disruptions that occur way to frequently. We can’t let our vital goods be dependent on foreign suppliers."
2021-05-17 14:18:41,wallstreetbets,"Cheap goods don't matter when no one has any money to buy them...because the money has been shipped off to China.

Milton Friedman held that the economy that exports is the economy that loses.  His one exception was cash, that the economy that exports cash in exchange for goods was the winning economy.

Having tried that for decades now, the results are in and Friedman was wrong: exporting cash makes a nation's economy lose at least as much as he held that exporting goods did."
2021-05-17 17:53:03,wallstreetbets,Pesky kids as well.... 🤣
2021-05-17 17:51:52,wallstreetbets,Sounds like old fashioned equalization of trade. As it effectively was under the gold standard.

2021-05-17 17:20:08,wallstreetbets,And youre a Biden/Xi boot licker? Im about money and business bro
2021-05-17 14:20:04,wallstreetbets,So not his 'Murica First tariffs + rebranding of NAFTA?
2021-05-17 12:22:03,wallstreetbets,So ALMOST everything :)
2021-05-17 09:31:03,wallstreetbets,Idk my brain is smooth as fuck
2021-05-17 12:38:38,wallstreetbets,"I bet you think China makes superior goods because ""that's not how tariffs work.""

&#x200B;

EU steel is dogshit quality but it's dirt cheap. That's why when we tariff their import, companies have to use expensive superior US steel and customers benefit.

Trump definitely knew how tariffs worked better than you do."
2021-05-17 15:46:07,wallstreetbets,Love the 14 year old Reddit commies political takes
2021-05-17 16:33:54,wallstreetbets,"This, that steel has to be fucking shipped which means its lowest priority but that doesnt matter because everyone needs so much fucking steel eventually U.S steel companies will be booked."
2021-05-17 14:42:33,wallstreetbets,"unaffected  
recently"
2021-05-17 12:20:32,wallstreetbets,Supply is the issue right now. Residential construction already having major steel shortages and that's on top of lumber prices/availability
2021-05-17 10:48:23,wallstreetbets,It is good for industry.  The tariff cost is always passed on to the end consumer.
2021-05-17 13:21:47,wallstreetbets,"There is a lot of niche steel types that is only produced inside the eu. Many companies are forced to buy them with or without tarrifs as they need them.

Removing tariffs should lower overall cost production which is good for American manufacturers."
2021-05-17 11:39:00,wallstreetbets,It hurts the American consumer but helps the American producer
2021-05-17 14:28:18,wallstreetbets,U and whoever liked this are retarded

low cost steels, no"
2021-05-17 14:49:24,wallstreetbets,"I'm curious, what makes US steel superior to EU steel?"
2021-05-17 14:10:10,wallstreetbets,"Euro steel is junk?

Kinda puts all those razor ads with their ""superior German steel blades"" in a different light..."
2021-05-17 14:48:34,wallstreetbets,Yeah that
2021-05-17 14:14:34,wallstreetbets,"If tariffs lead to cost incentives for companies to use superior materials and support the local economy then yes, please.

History books tell me that, back before living memory, the USA once had tariffs high and (federal) taxes low.   I'd like to at least see that tried in my lifetime."
2021-05-17 12:32:21,wallstreetbets,"It helps the specific producer, but it harms all the other producers who are reliant on that particular product."
2021-05-17 16:07:11,wallstreetbets,Ah good thing we have regulated most of them out of existence and made it near impossible to start up new ones
2021-05-17 09:54:11,wallstreetbets,Exactly the point.
2021-05-17 16:35:20,wallstreetbets,Intel and AMD are pressuring Biden into an investment from federal government so they can reduce their dependence on Taiwan manufacturer (TSMC). So yeah that's a thing too.
2021-05-17 15:20:35,wallstreetbets,"Higher concentration of carbon, zinc, and Freedom."
2021-05-17 17:18:50,wallstreetbets,"Thing is, we didn't just have tariffs, we had other protections in place that basically ensured we had a strong labor economy. The US using foreign steel to make everything was a result of deregulation that finally allowed jobs to be offshored, and over the span of 10 years almost all US steel production shut down."
2021-05-17 12:43:46,wallstreetbets,True true
2021-05-17 14:15:53,wallstreetbets,So the problem would be solved by producers not relying on China?
2021-05-17 16:19:39,wallstreetbets,Gotta have some of that freedom baby yeehaw
2021-05-17 15:05:53,wallstreetbets,"In the US, tariffs can homogenize the prices between US and Chinese steel producers, so US non-steel producers can choose either. However, non-US non-steel producers, the competitors of US non-steel producers, can buy steel from China at a lower price, giving them an advantage over their US competitors. We cannot force (or can we?) every major country on earth to not rely on China"

Maybe there aren't shares available and the fact that that institutional ownership is down means that big boys are realizing the extent of retail ownership? No idea tbh...

2021-05-17 06:05:18,wallstreetbets,"Could be another day of ups and/or downs today, so here are some tips for you apes to stay on top of your game.

Stay hydrated - whisky is best here, but if before noon where you are, consider a healthier clear spirit like vodka or pure grain alcohol.

Eat a nutritious and balanced breakfast - make sure to include all five major crayon colours, and plenty of tendies for protein. Bananas are acceptable.

Perform one act of kindness - make your wife’s boyfriend a cup of coffee to start his day right - he’s probably very tired.

Do some mindfulness mantras - chanting a mantra over and over again can be very helpful in keeping the mind calm. A few suggestions include; ‘Holy Moly’, ‘I like the stock’, or ‘To the moon’.

Take some time away from your computer screen - in this day and age, sitting for too long in front of your computer can be very taxing. Be good to yourself, and occasionally switch to staring at your phone screen instead.

Good luck out there today, retards."

And it hurts my head
I guess it must be something
That I read

It's the color of your heartbeat
A rising summer sun
The battle lost or won
The flash to fashion
The pulse to passion
Feels red inside my head

And truth is often bitter left unsaid
Said red red
Thinking about the overhead
The underfed
Couldn't we talk about
Something else instead

We've got Mars on the horizon
Says the National Midnight Star
It's true
What you believe is what you are
A pair of dancing shoes
The Soviets are the blues
The reds, under your bed
Lying in the darkness
Dead ahead

And the mercury is rising
Barometer starts to fall
You know it gets to us all
The pain that is learning
And the rain that is burning
Feel red, still, go ahead
You see black and white
And I see red, red
Not blue"

It's undoubtedly over valued, and a lot of the value comes from Elon, but he's damaging that every time he opens his mouth.

On top of that they hardly made any money when you strip out corn earnings and regulatory credits, and now we have shortages, inflation, rising metals prices, and a weakening dollar, so when you have a product with 70Kg+ of copper alone, plus all the other metals, and metals are rising exponentially...

What is that going to do to the cost of production of each car? They are already over priced, and they'll have to stick the price up to struggling consumers with rising unemployment and less earnings for businesses, and etc.

So less demand and rising prices = what?

A booming company and stock price, or a disaster??

Burry gets it."

2021-05-17 08:17:02,wallstreetbets,"Advice Needed: Made a life changing mistake, need tax guidance

Hey guys, throwaway here as I’m too embarrassed to post under my real account.

I needed 100k in order to get enough for a down payment on a house, we’ve been saving up for 4 years but the market outpaced us (Bay Area). I’ve gotten very lucky over the past 18 months and turned 85k to 600k in my IRA trading options.

I decided to take a 60 day rollover loan, this is where you can take money out of your IRA for up to 60 days and if you put it all back within that time period you pay no taxes.

Anyways, my goal was to take the 600k from IRA to Brokerage, try and make a 20% return in 60 days and then return the initial 600k to the IRA. Well, I blew up, I’ve now lost 300k trading, I need help understanding the tax implications at this point. My assumption is that it’s game over and I’ll essentially need the remaining 300k just to pay my tax bill as early withdrawal will be income tax + 10%.

I know I’ve possibly made the biggest financial mistake of my life here, really looking for any advice on the tax situation here, appreciate any help that is provided."

2021-05-17 10:51:21,wallstreetbets,"I know waiting for a crash is terrible advice but I'm waiting for a crash

I mean the stars fucking align for this one, its not like 2008 where the only people who saw it coming where top highly experienced traders. Rising inflation, money being printed to keep the market alive, market reaching an all time high every other month now, many stocks essentially just being a straight line up from 2019 to present, stocks being vastly overvalued i mean some stocks that don't even make a profit are killing it somehow, market becoming increasingly volatile

Everything feels fake, idk i want to invest but I feel this market is a ticking time bomb. If you asked me in 2008 if you should invest I would have said yes because nobody saw it coming but now? Unfortunately just a matter of time if you thought the covid mini crash was bad wait till you see the next one.

2021-05-17 07:09:50,wallstreetbets,"Market always overreacts in both directions. I think it's worse now than in the past because algorithms start moves (so things start moving quickly) then momentum algorithms and traders amplify moves (so they go much further than they should).

The real problem is probably the momentum traders, especially on the short side. It's always easier to move a price down than up. Moving a price up requires a lack of people willing to sell at fair or above fair value. Moving a price down only requires a lack of buyers which is much more common."

2021-05-17 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Discussion: Reopening Trade (Air/Cruise, Casinos, Oil) I’m seeing macro trendlines of around 6 months (beginning November 6th, connecting around February 5th, and testing resistance right around now) in most of these stocks. 

Friday, I decided to load up on 1-2 week out OTM calls (at strikes probably around 10%-30% above the current market value). I’ll be throwing a couple grand a week at this trade til it hits! 

MGM, NCLH, BA, BP are my picks. Each from a different industry, positively impacted by the reopening and ensuing pent-up demand of the economy. I’m swinging for the MIL on this! 

I’m a bull here for technical reasons. However, the fundamentals make sense here now as well. The current bull-market trendlines on all the reopen stonks started with a vaccine announcement on November 9th in the early A.M. (the freaking insiders bought/drove up prices before the market opened, that sucked).

The CDC letting “vaccinated” people stop social distancing has majorly positive implications for the economy. Think of traveling, think of the impeding Memorial Day weekend...

Go check out the 1-year, 1-day charts for these stocks, and draw a line from the close on November 6th to now. I think we see 30% or more gains in the value of these stocks the next couple weeks. 

The market rewards those who risk more!............but only when you are correct in your prediction.

Let’s hear the case from the Bears."

You have a point that they might have plans to expand out. But, again, debt.

Vaccine efficacy is max 94%, here you have another 3 to 4% of not vaccinated, potentially sick people. 4. After 1 year at least 10% of people will be late to vaccinate. Here you go - 38% of people that will eventually get sick. Media will speak about it, people will go Zoom for long, even though life will be ok. It is called 10% economy."

2021-05-17 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"HD earnings Strangle with JACKPOT! First off, this is my first Discussion on r/Wallstreetbets. Not financial advice. I'm probably retarded. That's being said let's go!

Home Depot reports earnings premarket 5/18. HD has beat earnings consistently and the share price has reacted negatively each time. In this market I feel like the play here is a strangle. My proposed play is the closest to the money strikes. Right now based on $324 list that would be the 5/21 323.5P/325C. You are in for about $1k. Break even is 3% in either direction. Of course we are hoping for 6% at least.

November earnings was a beat and the stock dropped 6% that day. That would be 100% profit with the trade I propose for educational purposes only. The previous report had a -3.2% drop that day which would still print.

Here is the kicker. The 5 day high is $344 (5/10) and low $317 (5/12) for a 2 day swing of 8.4% bases on Friday close. This is key because it means there is the potential for both sides of the strangle to be profitable prior to expiration! Nuts right?

Here is how to play it. Watch the housing report tomorrow (5/17). With lumber prices being insane new construction might be a miss. If HD stock goes down you will need to consider if the market will price this in when digesting an earnings miss. You will want to wait until the end of the day to enter the strangle to make sure you have strikes that put the Monday close in the middle.

If earnings are a beat and the prices goes up >3% sell the call once you are happy with the profit. Lock in your tuition money because again, this is for education. Same goes for the inverse. Then you have until Friday to try to get tendies with the other side. Can't remember the Vince Vaughn line from Dodge ball but it think it's ""that's what we call the jackpot"".

Not WSB material you say? Earnings plays are inherently gambling and sir, this is a casino.

Positions: none yet. Ask me at 3PM tomorrow you illiterate ape.

TLDR: Home Depot is usually located in  very close proximity to a Wendy's = tendies.

2021-05-17 13:46:26,wallstreetbets,"HD price will drop tomorrow morning.  It gone negative after earnings open the last 5 consecutive times.  HD doesn’t go up immediately after earnings - it goes down.  It will go back up in the long term.

The real play is wait for the drop tomorrow and then buy long term (2-3 month) calls.  Cash money, baby."
2021-05-16 23:36:23,wallstreetbets,"This seems like a good plan and then you notice it involves buying options, then you know it’s a good plan.

2021-05-17 11:51:22,wallstreetbets,Couldn't the argument be made that because lumber and such is getting so expensive people are doing the work themselves - which would push up HD?
2021-05-16 23:50:39,wallstreetbets,True thetagang would have been out of this contract 2 weeks ago
2021-05-16 23:44:59,wallstreetbets,Wouldn’t that be the lack of volatility that would stomp this within 12 hrs? This is a day trade.
2021-05-16 23:27:00,wallstreetbets,I haven’t bought anything yet. It all depends on how HD reacts to the housing report.
2021-05-17 14:09:35,wallstreetbets,"I agree that it does dip 2-6% when they report. But earnings have been wild this time around which is why I want to employ a strangle. I don't have to be right about direction.

Question to you is do you think it dips more than 3% intra day? The play I describe needs >3% intra day to print before theta or IV crush kills it."
2021-05-16 23:42:56,wallstreetbets,Why are you here on r/wallsreetbets if not for the casino?

2021-05-16 23:28:50,wallstreetbets,Let’s see tomorrow after the housing report. That seems a little extra.
2021-05-17 00:37:22,wallstreetbets,Let’s get money. That doesn’t necessitate being a racist.
2021-05-17 13:22:30,wallstreetbets,I agree that more people may opt to do the work themselves as contractors would likely pass the material costs off the to client at a premium. But I also suspect that if the stock price surges intra day and maybe into Wednesday shareholders are likely to take profits as HD is near ATH. That cloud cause the stock to dip making the put valuable as well. This is why I like a strangle and not a condor. I expect volatility which makes a condor tough to manage.
2021-05-17 00:03:01,wallstreetbets,With a strangle you paid priced in premium so share the results if it pays off like u hoped
2021-05-17 14:29:27,wallstreetbets,"Hard to say.  Last earnings they blew it out and it dipped 3%, largest drop of the 5 prior earnings.  I’d say it drops anywhere between 1-3% this time."
2021-05-17 00:04:56,wallstreetbets,"I don’t think your plan is that stupid... my money is tied up in PLTR so I know a thing or two about being stupid.

Options are precarious AF and I like to make light of that fact. WSB is a fun place to do it."
2021-05-16 23:30:14,wallstreetbets,"A good play gets posted on wsb and the mm try to kill it. I’m seeing a trend. I love it here but fuck I question everything.

Tbh I just hoped stock picker bot would have picked up on my pick"
2021-05-17 00:20:11,wallstreetbets,Follow this one as a lesson as to how to do or do not. Like 8 said previously I don’t know if I will pull the trigger until 3pm tomorrow.
2021-05-17 00:22:41,wallstreetbets,Let us know - I hope it works but will be fun either way.
2021-05-17 00:25:15,wallstreetbets,Fun thing is my thesis is that it will (knock on wood) work both ways!
2021-05-17 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,That feeling when you becoma a bagholder because of someones DD 
2021-05-17 08:16:32,wallstreetbets,"Step one: grab a stock for quick buck.   
Step two: watch it burn down.  
Step three: Cry.   
Step four: Call it a long term investment to keep your sanity."

2021-05-17 07:56:26,wallstreetbets,"They were down playing apes on SVU on Thursday. Talking about us basically bring a cukt and worshiping a leader like he was a profit to squeeze hedge funds.  They mentioned it briefly. Then later in the ep. They use the dialog in interrogation ""you are gonna get hurt on this, don't be a bagholder.""  Ice T and Olivia Benson have shorts I bet."

2021-05-17 13:24:22,wallstreetbets,"ICLN, CRSR, and BB here.   My loss porn isn't too bad yet, and I went with shares not options since I just don't quite have that level of risk tolerance (or disposable income) yet.  

BB- as others have said, I do think it's got legit long term potential. 

CRSR - I'm not a big gamer/computer guy, but I liked the DD and figured why not.. I'm thinking the chip shortage is hurting them - at least that's my hope ?  

ICLN - one of the first ""meme stocks"" I kept seeing mentioned last year, I'm a believer in green energy and thought with a slightly different political climate stateside there'd be more movement here.  Not really sure what to do with this one, it's my biggest loser so far.  

On a funny note, after the whole Robinhood fiasco in January, I rage bought FNF and that actually worked out reasonably well for me haha, though I've since cashed that one out for gains."

tl:dr Blackberry is having it's annual meeting."

[**Anders Bylund**](https://boards.fool.com/profile/TMFZahrim/info.aspx) **(Nokia):** Few tech stocks have weathered the recent market storm quite like Finnish telecom infrastructure veteran Nokia. The stock has gained 32% since the New Year, including a 14% jump over the last 30 days. By contrast, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index is trading flat in 2021 and fell 7% in the last month.

This stock may feel like a joke due to the recent influx of Nokia interest from the Reddit-based WallStreetBets group, but that's just a coincidence. Nokia's real-world business prospects are solid and the stock is actually undervalued, even though it dodged the tech-stock market correction in recent months.

Nokia's solid market position was built on a foundation of [5G network](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/communication/5g-stocks/) installations. Top-line sales are rising faster than expected, Nokia's profit margin is expanding as we speak thanks to the richer product mix, and the stock is changing hands for less than eight times free cash flow. You don't see that combination of deep-discount stock prices and robust business trends very often, and that makes Nokia a no-brainer buy right now."

Every $.18 (that's 18 cents) that the stock increases adds 1 BILLION dollars to their market cap.

There's going to be a lot of resistance to big price changes with their 5.6 billion outstanding shares.

They are also leaders in 5G technology and Huawei is losing contracts to them. I still wouldn’t purchase due to share dilution but I wouldn’t say it’s a terrible buy.

2021-05-16 22:11:13,wallstreetbets,"Nice, you can use that against your new capital gains as tax deductions. I paid nothing in taxes in 2020 even though I made double of my annual salary, they even had to give me back $5,000+ as tax refunds. It was fun. I kinda plan it all when I allocate my funds in my portfolios and it all worked well. Doing the same rules for my investments this year."

Seems like they cap it at a $3k claim but if, like this post, you have $9k more.. do you get 3 more years at 3k? (Plus we all know we'll lose more so it's basically Infinity, right?) 

Not sure these loss claims even help if we do standard deduction.. turbotax gameifies this whole tax thing but I have very little idea of what made a difference without basically just doing it all over again."

Capital losses can fully eat up capital gains within the same year. That $3,000 deduction limit is if you lose more than you made in investments and you can apply it to your regular income that year."

I actually hate it because you can't claim anymore than that, so here OP shoes that he has 9somrthing thousand dollars more in loss but you can only roll it over the next 7 years. So if you lost 30k (that happened to do many people in 2008) you could only report 21 k in.. 7 years. Yet, we have to pay taxes on all gains in the entire year."

2021-05-16 21:03:39,wallstreetbets,You can only use $3k/year you ape.

2021-05-17 02:11:29,wallstreetbets,"It made me curious so I looked it up. 

This capital loss law was last updated in 1977 from $2k into $3k of tax write-off starting that year! That was 44 years ago! It wasn’t even adjusted for inflation! 

Adjusted for inflation, that $3k is now worth $13,220.50.

2021-05-16 22:55:29,wallstreetbets,"$3k. Found out when I did my taxes yesterday. It's pretty neat considering that I'm 100% gains in December, but I mostly withdrew my losers so it netted the full $3k."

2021-05-16 21:55:47,wallstreetbets,Give taxes owed to a charity of your choosing?
2021-05-16 22:37:27,wallstreetbets,"Am ape, not smart.

Some high income folks actually set up charitable trusts / foundations for this purpose. 

It’s also why donating appreciated stock to charity can carry huge tax advantages. You get to deduct the full value of the shares, including your basis and any short or long term capital gains.

…and I believe you can combine both strategies, not that I’ve got the $$$ (or gains) to make it worthwhile. 

Of course, you still need to clear the standard deduction for any of this to matter.

2021-05-16 22:03:06,wallstreetbets,That 10k tax free unemployment was great because I paid the tax upfront because I didn't want to pay it later. I got a hefty return this year

2021-05-17 02:49:37,wallstreetbets,"
A wash sale occurs when an investor sells or trades a security at a loss, and within 30 days before or after, buys another one that is substantially similar. It also happens if the individual sells the security at a loss, and their spouse or a company they control buys a substantially similar security within 30 days."

2021-05-17 09:05:14,wallstreetbets,"I was new to day trading (just got over 25k in my brokerage) and did not know that wash sales were a thing. Previously I just bought and held for a while. So this year I would often sell and buy back, trying to time the market. Well I lost all the money I made and then some. It just ended up that my wash sales were enough that I couldn’t deduct any of my losses from my taxes."
2021-05-17 09:13:29,wallstreetbets,"I didn’t lose any money. I double my income but because most of my profit are tax sheltered and to the  capital gains that I need to pay taxes that’s where I less all my deductions such as my full retirement fund contributions, plus I have 3 dependents. Basically from any of my investments I only pay taxes on half a taxable capital gains because half of my assets are allocated in a tax sheltered account, then retirement fund account. I only get taxed in my non registered investment account and because I live in Canada capital gains are only taxed on the half of the gains."
2021-05-16 23:56:18,wallstreetbets,Yeah that's what I was asking. Cause I don't mind paying taxes at all I just rather have the money do direct good instead of just giving bonuses to council members.

I selected the one which gave me more deduction."

2021-05-16 22:34:20,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-05-17 00:13:56,wallstreetbets,"So this is where us retards differentiate between people who actually read investopedia and other resources. I have no idea what the hell I’m doing. I basically bought a security, sold at profit, bought back into the same security for not much less than the profit I made, thinking it would go up. Day traded it quickly a few times, some at profit and loss. Then it plummeted to the depths of hell and I sold at a major loss within 30 days. As you can guess, this was GME and I’m sure there will be an army of morons like me wondering what the hell is going on next tax season. I was under the impression that I mega fucked myself and will have to pay taxes on the money I sold at a profit and then also not be able to write off as losses because I bought into the the same security within 30 days."
2021-05-17 12:01:22,wallstreetbets,"You can’t sell a stock for a loss and then buy back into the same stock within 30 days and still claim those losses for that year. The only way to do that is if you sell the stock before the year is over, there’s some deadline date for that. Basically I sold some stocks and made money which I owe taxes on, then I sold some stock and lost money and then bought back in that same stock within the 30 days. Because I held that stock I sold at a loss past 2020, I can’t claim it against my capital gains and therefore I still have to pay taxes on it which is what I did. This year my gains all evaporated and I am now at a loss. Which means I am sorta paying doubly for my mistakes through taxes. I paid taxes for gains I don’t have anymore."
2021-05-17 08:54:35,wallstreetbets,"I just mean to close (aka exit) your wash sale position at least 30 days before the end of the year. If you want to claim losses on a wash sale, then you have to choose between either closing the position and claiming the losses, or holding the position open. You can't do both.

&#x200B;

If you close the position by the last 30 days of the year, it just allows you to claim the losses on the wash sale. It will adjust your cost basis based upon your open and closing prices"
2021-05-17 01:05:23,wallstreetbets,"Pretty sure 31 days from last position in the stock that had wash; as that kinda carry’s the penalty from previous...ironically can make loss larger because you may not figure in wash when rebuying; as last loss of position could compound larger w/wash and make a loss a little bigger....I’m probably wrong, but I think this is part of something"
2021-05-17 08:47:23,wallstreetbets,oooof sorry man. Hoping you see those gains come back so it's a non-issue.

2021-05-16 22:42:55,wallstreetbets,"I paid my taxes upfront on my unemployment and got $330 back for 2020. I filed really early though, like the same week I got my W-2. So, maybe that money will come back to me for 2021? Yes? Maybe? Please?

I also lost about $1000 in the market at the end of 2020. Gotta figure out how to get that back when I file for 2021."
2021-05-17 02:15:49,wallstreetbets,I was on the opposite end and hadn't paid the taxes and it caused me to go from owing ~300 to getting 1100 back.
2021-05-17 02:54:04,wallstreetbets,Was that $600 a week included in the 10k?
2021-05-17 05:30:58,wallstreetbets,How is that great?  You should be aiming to break even because any money the government owes you was an interest free loan to them that you could have invested instead.
2021-05-17 07:32:39,wallstreetbets,you loaned the IRS your money for free
2021-05-17 09:07:47,wallstreetbets,"Maybe putting crayons in my coffee wasn’t a good idea, but isn’t this not necessarily good because the money you paid in taxes up front could have been used to invest and grow?

2021-05-17 05:14:29,wallstreetbets,"When you sell the wash at a loss though, you still gain the same tax credits? If you gain, well that was worth it"
2021-05-16 23:26:15,wallstreetbets,"This is wrong. If I have a carryover of $10k loss. and I have a cap gain next year of $15,000, I can use the entire $10k carryover to offset and only recognize $5k of gain income.

If I have a $10k carryover, and a $5k gain the next year, I can offset the entire $5k, plus another $3k of loss and carry over $2k to the following year.

Edit: To clarify, your total NET loss each year is limited to $3k. You can offset as much gain as you want with the carryover until you hit that net again."
2021-05-16 23:11:41,wallstreetbets,Damn you got downvoted hard. That’s what I understood the rule as too

2021-05-16 23:58:53,wallstreetbets,"I think they do, but really I'm not sure. I was surprised by it and thankfully went to a tax person. I think that if you have exactly $3k in capital losses you get exactly $3k returned. Someone smarter than me will have to confirm though."

2021-05-17 00:16:04,wallstreetbets,Basically the way write offs work is that you avoid being taxed for the amount that you write off. So if you make 100k and you write off 40k then you will only be taxed on 60k.

2021-05-16 23:24:23,wallstreetbets,"It sounds like you're talking about taking the standard deduction vs itemized deductions. That shouldn't affect capital gains or losses, since capital gain or loss is not a ""deduction"" it is an ""adjustment to income."" But you don't just get $3k cash. The loss offsets $3k of your income. So if you make $50k but have $3k loss you would pay taxes as if you made $47k"
2021-05-16 23:35:29,wallstreetbets,"if you didn't have capital gains to offset loss then it should directly reduce your taxable income, which means you pay less tax and it takes 3K off any income 

it would not be 3K directly off taxes owed but it would reduce your overall taxes 

after claiming capital loss, you then take the standard deduction and pay tax on that amount 

is that what you did? 

don't want you to pay a dime extra to gov't so you may want to look over taxes again 
 

as long as you see where it reduced your income by 3K then all good"

2021-05-17 00:48:41,wallstreetbets,As long as the gain and loss were in the same year and you didn't wash it into an IRA you'll probably be able to offset the gains with the losses.
2021-05-17 08:46:33,wallstreetbets,"Essentially, as long as you close out any of your wash sale eligible positions 31 days before the end of the tax year (and they are not held by a business you own or your spouse) then it will be all good. Essentially, your losses/gains will be added or subtracted from your cost basis, meaning your cost basis and time owned (to determine whether it was short or long term gains) will be adjusted accordingly. 

&#x200B;

In short, close it out by the last week in November, make sure it's not owned by any other person and/or entity legally associated with you, make sure you don't buy back into it until 31 days, and you're all good"

When you go to type in the second box it finds the correct list and sorts it by popularity.

2021-05-16 23:45:54,wallstreetbets,"They worded it really crappy, the ""large loss and no gains"" is assuming no gains in those future years as well.

If it is worth anything, I do taxes for a living and have to explain this multiple times to clients each year. The way tax law is written can be quite confusing, but rest assured its the total net loss each year is stuck at $3,000. so yes if you have no gains, you will only get a $3k deduction. you will never see a loss over $3k on a tax return. But you can offset as much cap gains as you want with the losses you have, whether current or from the prior years. just at the end of the day, you are capped at a $3k loss net."

I’m not American but with some english literacy I can figure out that the $3,000 cap applies to ordinary income. The cap doesn’t apply to capital gains."
2021-05-16 23:13:01,wallstreetbets,"This isn’t true. You can deduct against capital gains with no limit, it’s just against regular income that it’s 3k."

From Investopedia,

""A wash sale occurs when an investor sells or trades a security at a loss, and within 30 days before or after this sale, buys another one that is substantially similar.""

""It also happens if the individual sells the security at a loss, and their spouse or a company they control buys a substantially similar security within 30 days.""

This loss can be added to the cost basis though, so you should be recalculating your profit with this new cost basis."

2021-05-17 01:15:40,wallstreetbets,"It probably means its in the process rather than sitting somewhere, but its probably still sitting somewhere in the process lol but atleast they'll get to it.. what number did you call to talk to someone??"

2021-05-17 08:05:32,wallstreetbets,"50% of capital gains are taxed at your marginal tax rate. So if you made 100k off stonks, 50% of that is added to your taxable income. 

I’m sure there’s more specifics, but that’s basically all I’ve had to deal with so far."
2021-05-17 18:11:03,wallstreetbets,"Wouldn’t know, haven’t been trading long enough to pay 😎

I was thinking of just doing what Wesley Snipes did"
2021-05-17 16:57:20,wallstreetbets,"I’m going to need some kind of source for that, a quick google search contradicts what you’re saying. I think you’re confusing margin with all trades.

> The Depository Trust & Clearing Corp., or DTCC, the main hub for U.S. stock markets, demanded large sums of collateral from brokerages including Robinhood that for weeks had facilitated spectacular jumps in shares such as GameStop. In response, Robinhood and some other trading platforms raised large sums of money to post with the DTCC to increase their backstop against losses. They also reined in the risk to themselves by banning certain trades. Robinhood also moved to unwind some client bets, igniting an outcry from customers.

2021-05-17 01:01:42,wallstreetbets,Source for that?
2021-05-17 07:13:27,wallstreetbets,Lol RH wasn't the only broker forced to do that by clearing corporations. Many did the same...
2021-05-17 09:01:13,wallstreetbets,"You clearly don't have enough money in the market for it to matter or else a broker going down on huge trade days would absolutely be a big deal to you. Some people lost tens of thousands and even hundreds of thousands on that day because they couldn't sell positions. You'd be furious if your account was basically frozen as it dwindled down 90% because you couldn't access your money. Or if you had options worth thousands that you couldn't sell due to server being down and they expired worthless because you could access your account.

It's sad you're not mature enough though to admit you were wrong and didn't know the whole story. 

Anyway though you do you, just remember RH has a history of fucking their members and you were warned about it."

2021-05-16 23:13:36,wallstreetbets,I got $764 from my state and they are greedy assholes. I usually owe. I think my state gave my tax money back for unemployment. Almost $24k of my income was unemployment last year. I couldn't believe it haha

2021-05-17 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation (Week 5) - $HD, $WMT, $TGT, $LOW, $CSCO, $GOEV, $XL, $SE and More **Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation (Week 5) - $HD, $WMT, $TGT, $LOW, $CSCO, $GOEV, $XL, $SE and More**

&nbsp;

What's poppin' bull gang, Flux here with Week 5 of the Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation. I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week, cause it's time to do it all again! Earnings season is slowly coming to an end, so this weeks spreadsheet is a little smaller than prior weeks, but that's alright, there's still money to be made.

&nbsp;

All that being said, I fucking love earnings season. It’s an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What’s not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they’re one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn’t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you’re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn’t working for you, refer to the link below!

&nbsp;

[Spreadsheet HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing)

&nbsp;

Please note that scraping and compiling this data took *hours*. If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment and peep my socials! It would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I’ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **Expect larger moves coming out of retailers this week**. Home Depot, Lowe's, Walmart, and Target all have fairly conservative historical moves, but will likely break trend this earnings. Last quarter was fucking *massive* for these retail giants, as the holidays combined with stimulus cheques will likely lead to insane profits among them. Expect a large move to happen for each corresponding retailer, to either the upside or downside.

&nbsp;

- **Lots of Chinese tech companies report this week.** If you're looking for a fun little collateral play, you can take a look at various Chinese tech ETFs and paly options on them. The IV on the ETFs is general lower than the ones on the individual tickers, although most of the tickers move in tandem with one another. If one beats, they usually all beat, and vice versa.

&nbsp;

- **Don't fall for the Solar trap**. Solar has been heavily beat down all throughout earnings season, and as a result you may be inclined to buy Puts. Canadian Solar and Maxeon Solar have both slid extremely far following the movements of their peers throughout earnings, and are likely primed for a reversal. There isn't much farther for these stocks to go down, and as a result, a terrible earnings for both of these companies is already priced in. If they even match estimates, or put up a beat, they will likely move upwards. This exact situation occurred with Nikola two weeks back. I would look to play a neutral to bullish strategy on these tickers.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 50 companies, there's plenty that I’ve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I’d love to see what you guys come up with.

# Conclusion

We’ve got an insane lineup of companies reporting earnings this week, meaning there’s a huge variety of plays to be made for traders of all skills and styles! Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people found these useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season! If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment, and checking out my socials, it would mean a lot to me! **Happy Trading Everybody! :)**"

2021-05-17 19:33:39,wallstreetbets,So there is at least one corroborated case where an employee actually had an affair with Gates (confirmed by Gates’ spokesperson). Maybe the NYT has some authentic sources on the matter (in regards to Gates’ other attempts to have extramarital affairs).
2021-05-17 19:57:06,wallstreetbets,So you're telling me the guy who is [lecturing the planet on climate change](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/14/bill-gates-on-his-carbon-footprint.html) whilst [simultaneously buying the world's largest private jet service company](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bill-gates-joins-private-equity-firms-in-4-7-billion-deal-for-private-jet-company-11612534767)  isn't a fucking snake?

2021-05-16 21:16:31,wallstreetbets,So Gates maybe spent some time on the Lolita Express 😂.  Is there a wealthy person that hasn't hung out with Epstein?
2021-05-16 20:32:19,wallstreetbets,"I mean...put yourself in her shoes. 

You get called into your boss' office, the richest man in the world...

2021-05-17 05:08:16,wallstreetbets,Nope it’s just the usual divorce smear campaign. You’ll see it disappear once the divorce is finalized and she’s got her money.

I saw that and it ties in with other hedgefunds which all went quiet in november and ceo's filed divorce. One of them claims to have recovered from a 20 bill loss then gets a divorce and turns out the hedgefund possibly isn't even operating and took all the damage right back.

Most of these portfolios are almost all derivatives, no assets."
2021-05-17 12:47:31,wallstreetbets,So Bill was involved in the pedo stuff? Or he lost a lot of money with risky investments and the divorce is just so he can “lose” a lot of money in a less embarrassing fashion. Find that comment I’m so confused!

Also wouldn't fuck the help/workers, you don't fuck the help just like you don't fuck the kids.

2021-05-17 17:12:46,wallstreetbets,"the problem these guys have is that at heart they are nerds. Applies to a guy at my company who was an ad agency superstar and derailed his career with office attempted relations with a subordinate, even applies to Tiger Woods. They never develop any confidence around women, because they never even had a girlfriend until after they were rich and/or famous. They are just so happy to get laid that the logic that regular dudes would apply goes out the window lol.

People wondered how Tiger could cheat on the smoke show wife. Well, he never had regular childhood, never sowed any wild oats, he was a nerd sheltered by his parents, was already a celebrity before he got to college. Instantly marries the hot blonde because deep down inside he was stunned that he could possibly even hook up with her. Then women coming onto him and he tries to make up for all the lost time at once lol."

Before it got public he was doing good, approval ratings high and all that.

But yea it was unprofessional, blah blah blah.  Frankly if it was consensual idgaf and honestly don't think anyone else should either."
2021-05-17 19:29:00,wallstreetbets,Oh come on. You can’t blame Hillary for doing something to the women who slept with her husband. You maybe can’t blame them either but just because they can’t be blamed doesn’t mean Hillary was wrong. People have a really hard time putting themselves in other people’s shoes and always expect people to do nothing regardless of what happens to them. I swear a person could get slapped in the face and some people would say they were wrong to slap the person back. “They shouldn’t have gotten angry when they were slapped “ I could hear some people say.

You don't understand that the main point I made was that ""Gates became friends with Epstein AFTER his initial pedo convictions?""  You choose to ignore the main point and instead split hairs over a minor detail that has no bearing on the overall point?  And then laugh about it like you won an argument?

Honestly I am genuinely baffled by this interaction. Are you an actual, literal retard?  Please explain why/how them meeting in 2011 vs ""like 2013"" changes literally anything about the overall point."
2021-05-17 08:38:05,wallstreetbets,nowhere in that article Bill Gate did anything to a minor. tho it's sus af and he's def needs to be investigated. but he's probably a crook with a lot of money so it's probably never happening. 🤷

It takes commitment and not having affairs.  So much is coming out about his long-term womanizing.  It’s really sad that this family is now torn apart
2021-05-17 19:48:03,wallstreetbets,"It would be understandable if she was pissed at Bill and the girls he slept with, but she didn't seem to care about the cheating aspect. It was an open secret that Bill had been doing that for decades.

We live in a capitalist world, people need to make money to pay rent and support their families. That doesn't change, no matter what your ideology is. Stock trading is just another way to make money for some people. It's not like the average trader is pulling in tens of millions a year.

For all we know there are some women who said no.

2021-05-17 13:10:07,wallstreetbets,"You manage to make huge assumptions about my views, insult me, and invite me to chat all at once... Let's go through that real quick and then I'm going to stop wasting my time since you've proven you lack the maturity for a conversation. 

No mature adult says ""I'd destroy you"" in terms of a conversation, saying that gives off the air of either someone who hasn't grown mentally since high school or thinks might makes right. Since you can't write proper sentences I highly doubt that you are well read, otherwise you would have picked up something about how to express a thought, let alone make a compelling argument from those works. 

Finally, I'm not a liberal otherwise I wouldn't have bothered to try to understand you. Rather, I find myself in an awkward place of disliking both parties emensley, but I dislike personality cults more than either so thanks to our 2 party system I unfortunately find myself in the group that voted for Bidden rather than see the worst Hitler impersonation America has ever called leader continue his role. Given the choice, I wish the whole nation would adopt a ranked-choice system similar to Maine in order to reduce the power of career politicians and give rise to more moderate candidates that either find a middle ground between the parties or are willing to compromise.

I don't disagree that there is a lot of corruption in politics, and Epstein definitely died under more than suspicious circumstances. I find it insane that there aren't more resources being supplied to investigating his death and would love to see droves of corrupt businessmen and politicians on both sides face life in prison for child sex trafficking."

Dont get me wrong, i wish you'll make money on SNDL, but it think their products dont have any future (i dont think vaping will last long) and so far it doesnt look like they care about their investors. I hope for you that they announce an acquisition or something."
2021-05-17 18:18:29,wallstreetbets,I consider SNDL more like a cannabis bank than an actual growers. The CEO is capable of everything. They were deep into debt not so long ago and they now sit on almost a billion$ without considering how much money they have from shares. They have the cash to acquire anyone they’d like to. Maybe I’m wrong but I don’t see them under 1$ for very long. Hope that their beating is over.

2021-05-17 16:55:11,wallstreetbets,Also huge share lockup ends tomorrow I think we’re in for a nice ride 📉
2021-05-17 18:36:29,wallstreetbets,My crazy co-workers use Dash all the time. I think a Subway sandwich costs like $20 delivered.

2021-05-17 03:55:00,wallstreetbets,"I started the sign up process with dash then stopped, now I get texts with them increasing the amount of money they will pay me to do a few deliveries everytime. First it was, do 6 deliveries by tomorrow for 50 extra dollars! Then it was do 3 for 100, then 3 by 3 days from now for 150. Now I am waiting for that 200 dollars extra and I might just do the 3 deliveries and proceed to never do another one.

Me thinks they might be hurting for people to work for them like so many low wage companies right now."
2021-05-17 02:06:16,wallstreetbets,"Restaurants have delivery service which hence means they have dash do the work, hence doordash is going to be in business for a while. Unless workers start working min wage jobs again....which I don’t see that happening anytime soon unless the min wage job goes up ⬆️ which again I don’t see that happening"

2021-05-17 03:17:34,wallstreetbets,🙏
2021-05-17 08:03:54,wallstreetbets,Idk why but people don't believe in long-dated options in this sub.  They rather get weeklies or similar and just hand thetagang money.
2021-05-17 15:04:54,wallstreetbets,"Yep, it went green.. I’m still holding.. going to wait till Wednesday EOD or Thursday am.

Edit: and yes I know I’m a degenerate.."
2021-05-16 22:15:57,wallstreetbets,Ummmm he lost everything you idiot they’re puts
2021-05-17 16:54:08,wallstreetbets,Right* lol
2021-05-17 03:23:13,wallstreetbets,I bought Friday when it was up 14%.. thought it might drop and if it didn’t figured it would def drop on Tuesday when the lockup expires.. it went up more and I doubled down (which was probably really dumb to do)
2021-05-17 03:18:11,wallstreetbets,Fuck should I delete it ? Or too late ??
2021-05-17 16:54:00,wallstreetbets,The most the account could afford probably.
2021-05-17 00:01:51,wallstreetbets,You could be right. Or wrong
2021-05-17 00:06:48,wallstreetbets,50 percent change you could be right or wrong
2021-05-17 02:35:13,wallstreetbets,"Restaurants in my area are doing everything they can to not use DASH and other delivery app companies. The pandemic made it more of an issue. They are realizing if they need a delivery driver, they'll hire one. Pizza stores have been doing this forever without delivery apps. I think the end of pandemic will hurt these delivery companies. The only reason ppl ordered so much delivery was bc they couldn't leave home. Nobody wants to pay a delivery fee for food that was meant to eat fresh at the restaurant to begin with if they have other choices"
2021-05-17 08:52:59,wallstreetbets,"Well min wage go up, companies offering more then min wage (I know some Chipotles are offering $16 an hour and still can't find anyone) or if the unemployment benefits end the Fed Benefit. I work a pretty decent desk job and in take home pay I'd make more on unemployment then I do working, substantially more if it was the $600 they were offering last year. So right now if you make less then 65k a year there is very little reason to want to work when you could just make more on unemployment. (Though after about 45k to starts to becomes take home vs gross kind of issue for me I'd ""take home"" more but that's with no 401k contributions and no health insurance which I never use)"
2021-05-16 22:50:00,wallstreetbets,They didn't get your money bro.  The guy who sold you the puts did.  Perhaps ask him to be your wife's boyfriend in exchange for a monthly-allowance!
2021-05-16 21:34:13,wallstreetbets,I own basically a small business version of these guys and I would at least give you free lifetime delivery for that sort of donation..
2021-05-17 08:20:08,wallstreetbets,I think their free float frees up tomorrow
2021-05-16 20:05:45,wallstreetbets,"Naw, Bridgette the midget gives the best returns."
2021-05-16 20:10:54,wallstreetbets,Oh shit I just assumed calls but they’re puts 😂😂
2021-05-17 03:33:35,wallstreetbets,"Hang in there, you still have few days. I bought few puts a month out towards the market close. No way $DASH in long right right..."
2021-05-17 07:17:16,wallstreetbets,so what comprises the other 50%?
2021-05-17 03:26:10,wallstreetbets,Noice.. let me know where to send $.. (if I have any left in am)

ADDITIVE EVERYTHING

3D PRINTED AIRPLANE ENGINES this is some futuristic next tech tree shit you only see in Starcraft. Is Ge going to be the first to make a battle cruiser? I don't fucking know, are there going to be Zerg, possibly who the fuck knows in this simulation. You think they're going to just stop there and this brings me to my next point. Air travel is going to start to recover bigly soon.

Renewables

WIND TURBINES these things are so fucking optimized, have you seen the Haliade-x 14Mw of Power. Have you been looking at the news, look in Biden's eyes you can practically see the propeller turning, he just approved of the first farm. These bitches are going to be popping up everywhere offshore. There's already 17 wind farms being planned in the Atlantic ocean. 1,500 Wind turbines. 

[https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/national-international/changing-climate/offshore-wind-turbines-renewable-energy-atlantic-ocean-new-jersey-united-states-climate-change/2723432/](https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/national-international/changing-climate/offshore-wind-turbines-renewable-energy-atlantic-ocean-new-jersey-united-states-climate-change/2723432/)

And THATS JUST THE ATLANTIC OCEAN, WHAT ABOUT THE fucking LIBTARD PACIFIC OCEAN? You don't think mother fucking California isn't going to want FUCKING WIND TURBINE ACTION? You might be like kek I thought they wanted to preserve their coast line or some shit. FUCK NO! They're flippy floppy as fuck and power hungry this is going to happen whether you believe it or not. You don't think GAY PEOPLE are going to want wind turbines? If there's one thing I know about gay people its they love things that twirl, believe me I loved watching these things in the pass twirl as a kid, and my mom would call me a faggot all the time. I REFUSE TO APOLOGIZE FOR THIS!

[https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/02/11/wind-turbines-could-be-coming-to-californias-coast/](https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/02/11/wind-turbines-could-be-coming-to-californias-coast/)

Guess what fucking state is BETTER THAN CALIFORNIA in wind? MOTHER FUCKING BIG ASS TEXAS, the biggest mother fucking state to ever fucking live, 20% of their energy comes from wind ALREADY, what the fuck are you libtards doing?! TEXAS ALREADY LEAVING YOU IN THE DUST. I broke rule 5, what are you going to do about it, not going to wear a mask in my OWN HOUSE EITHER! Now wind turbines froze up for a bit, but guess what, they can be weather proofed so that shit doesn't happen ever again. They have mother fucking weather proofed wind turbines in Antarctica for fuck sakes.

[https://www.power-technology.com/projects/rossislandwindfarm/](https://www.power-technology.com/projects/rossislandwindfarm/)

And this is just the fucking OCEAN TOO! Guess what wind turbines can be put on also instead of water that's fucking right land too and there's plenty of that all the states have it. ^(One thing to note though wind turbines are much more efficient offshore.) Have you looked at the new CS GO MAP DE\_GRIND? THERE'S ALREADY 22 WIND TURBINES ON IT ALREADY, and believe me THEY'RE GOING TO ADD MORE! I CALL VALVE EVERY SINGLE DAMN DAY REQUESTING MORE TURBINES. That has to be a sign right? RIGHT?

And this is only in the fucking US, THERE'S OTHER FUCKING PLACES ALSO GE just partnered with Toshiba. 10 GW OF power buy 2030 1Gw each year in japan! THAT'S A FUCKING TON OF WIND TURBINES, holy shit. Toshiba is going to put a windmill in every single fucking Japan.

\*\*\*\*\*DON'T READ THIS PART UNLESS YOU'RE JIM CRAMER\*\*\*\*\*

>!Look Jim this part is for you, for your eyes only nobody else read I swear to fuck. I am going to need you to go and drain your bank account and put every single last red cent into GE, I feel it, you feel it. You know WSB doesn't give a shit about GE, I get it that's fine they didn't give a shit about GME in the beginning either with strong hard DD from DFV. Is this going to moon? No, but its going to have a sweet sweet dividend soon and a nice gradual increase for the years with other boomers flocking to it, yes. I know your portfolio is maybe 3-5% GE but I am going to need you to drain everything you have and make it 100% maybe even 130% GE why? I don't know I have a raging hard clue about this, I talked to you in my dreams. Did you have the same dream too? Ya, that's what I thought, we can both smell it blowing in the wind.!<

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Then there's SOLAR POWER, look at the 3rd fastest growing job market. GE is in this as well!

And there's so so so much other fucking cool ass shit that GE does, these bitches can make a train did you fucking know that? How bout all the medical tech stuff? They just released a new portable baby scanner.

LOADS OF DEBT being paid off.

Harry Markopolos the guy that caught Bernie Madoff says there's a bunch of fraud. So you know you are really gambling when you buy this stock if he says so. Nobody is trying to squeeze this. If you're a Tesla fanboy this stock probably isn't for you. Tesla and Edison hated each other, does this matter? Probably not, but it makes you wonder.

$8 Billion FREE FLOAT, not all that good BUT I AM USING CAPS, SO GET EXCITED!

$13 something is current price per share ---> 13 is a LUCKY NUMBER.

BILL GATES SAYS %80 wind/solar by 2040 or some shit like that in his book, believe me I read it

Bill Gates also READ Jeff Immelt book believe me I read it on reddit that he read it! he said so himself.

Jeff Immelt also has a tattoo of a fucking meatball on his hip. (previous CEO) Does this matter? Fuck ya it does meatballs are fucking awesome.

If you guys TRULY love risky plays THIS IS FUCKING IT! I don't know if money is going to start coming out of tech and into value, but if it were going to happen, I'd put my money that its going to happen sooner than later.

Every mother fucking state is going to have windmills, 

Once this ball starts to REALLY ROLL its going to ROLL, ROLL straight up that fucking hill and it won't stop, until its down the next hill then ROLLING up the next one then itll roll straight up fucking up MT EVEREST!!!

I AM WAVING THE FUCKING AMERICAN GOD DAMN FLAG RIGHT NOW ALERTING all of you like PAUL f'ing REVERE.

We talked about history and how society is collapsing and we both agreed stocks would crash soon, bigly, with a collapse of the US dollar to follow. The rocket did not care. Right across the river at Cape Canaveral they were showing off how they had everything they'd need to survive societal collapse and be just fine while this old man's social security check afforded him to sleep under a palm tree at the park with Kennedy Space Center for a view. He cooked some great pork chops to share with people at the park using the pavilion grills and some bark from the palm trees. I bought him a solar powered phone charger with some of my gains from an options trade I made while I was chillin with him at the park."

It is both fitting and filtering that good things and good people are often secured within seemingly impenetrable vaults, guarded in towering fortresses across rivers with broken bridges. It tests one’s entrepreneurial spirit to build a new bridge, courage and confidence to cross it, creativity to improvise makeshift adjustments when the build comes undone, determination to scale those lofty walls, and candid introspection to ask yourself whether you really want it as you patiently chip away at the vault, with the hollow promise of tomorrow. Some desires are so painful in their depths, some ambitions so deep in their resonance, that they can only manifest as patience, probity, and perseverance.

2021-05-17 02:14:02,wallstreetbets,"Discussion: Reopening Trade (Air/Cruise, Oil, Casinos)

I’m seeing macro trendlines of around 6 months (beginning November 6th, connecting around February 5th, and testing resistance right around now) in most of these stocks. 

Friday, I decided to load up on 1-2 week out OTM calls (at strikes probably around 10%-30% above the current market value). I’ll be throwing a couple grand a week at this trade til it hits! 

MGM, NCLH, BA, BP are my picks. Each from a different industry, positively impacted by the reopening and ensuing pent-up demand of the economy. I’m swinging for the MIL on this! 

I’m a bull here for technical reasons. However, the fundamentals make sense here now as well. The current bull-market trendlines on all the reopen stonks started with a vaccine announcement on November 9th in the early A.M. (the freaking insiders bought/drove up prices before the market opened, that sucked).

The CDC letting “vaccinated” people stop social distancing has majorly positive implications for the economy. Think of traveling, think of the impeding Memorial Day weekend...

Go check out the 1-year, 1-day charts for these stocks, and draw a line from the close on November 6th to now. I think we see 30% or more gains in the value of these stocks the next couple weeks. 

The market rewards those who risk more!............but only when you are correct in your prediction.

Let’s hear the case from the Bears."

2021-05-17 05:40:58,wallstreetbets,"Want me to list the reasons?

Edit: Posting this again...

For everyone thinking about buying AMC:

**It is ten times 2016 market cap levels,** 

It won't see ""2019"" revenue until 20**23**,

*It still has debt*, no new innovation, no new tech, no advertising, no marketing, no acquisitions, no mergers, no change in leadership, no opening new theatres, no renovating existing theatres.

People demographically in the USA have become **less and less interested in movie theatres for the last 10 years**. We are about *to potentially enter another economic downturn because of gigainflation*. Cinemas don't do well when the poors have no money.

People were opening short positions at 30, 25, 20, 15 and 10 - they will need AMC to be in the 150-200 range to even begin margin calls... and either way they can *justify to their lender* that they don't have to cover. Why? BECAUSE THE STOCK IS **FUNDAMENTALLY OVERVALUED**.

Institutions can *negotiate their covenants with the lenders*. They do **not have to cover.**

If AMC wanted a squeeze, they'd have issued something to force shorts to cover. Like a dividend... or split or anything.

Instead, they have *only done everything to help shorts cover by diluting the stock*. $4,000,000,000 has been raised by AMC through stock dilutions. What has that been used for? To prevent *bankruptcy*. That isn't bullish. They *still have debt*.

Who do you think was initiating those buys all on the same day? Did retail suddenly all decide in unison that some random day last week was the day to go all in?

**Absolutely not.** It was sparked by an institution. Conveniently we see AMC dilute the stock *on the same day*.

AM🤡s have ***WAY*** too much faith in this company.

WAY too much man."

2021-05-17 06:44:36,wallstreetbets,"What leading indicators are you looking at?  Price of gold (up), commodity futures (up),  CIBCR leading inflation index [https://economics.cibccm.com/economicsweb/cds?ID=12331&TYPE=EC\_PDF](https://economics.cibccm.com/economicsweb/cds?ID=12331&TYPE=EC_PDF) (up) , FRED Economic data (up) [https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/USSLIND](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/USSLIND).  


I don't get it.  No inflation?  Prices are rising.  Wages are rising along with it, even without federal mandates, in order to get people to return to a job.  Buffet even said in his shareholder meeting that prices have been rising, but he's been able to pass them on to the customer.  That is the bare-bones definition of inflation.  


But show me where you see no inflation.  Maybe you can convince me."

FEYE is small compared to many other cyber security companies but they are very good at what they do. They are the first ones companies and government agencies call once they get hacked. I have been buying the shit out of it every time it dips.

2021-05-17 05:51:52,wallstreetbets,"Obligatory, I'm no expert.  Comparing GOLD with KGC, it seems that KGC is outperforming on all the income statement metrics, but doesn't have as strong of a balance sheet.  That's not to say they aren't a strong company, they just have a little more debt.  When I was buying my miners I was focused on EV/Sales.  I was focused on those that were 2.50 or less and whether they were in the Russel or S&P.  It's why I didn't buy NEM.  Even so 2.50 is right where KGC is at.  If I could get KGC at below 7.50 this week, I will probably buy."

2021-05-17 08:27:47,wallstreetbets,"dumb questions here:

So when you buy Options, and they expire not in the money, that means you just pissed away your money?

But when they do go in the money, then you get those options at the cost of what you paid for the contract? OR do you also have to pay the current price of that stock for the 100 stocks your option buys you? And when you buy Put options then you agree that you will get to sell stocks you don't actually have right? It's a contract to sell stocks? Or am I getting it wrong?

Never dabbled in options trading, and I don't really understand it either, but I'd like to be able to understand the memes hence my questions"

2021-05-17 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Roblox will be volatile in 2021 due to monthly reporting over quarterly reports. Sup ya'll. I was reading through Roblox investors relations and thought it was note-worthy that this company is not doing traditional quarterly reports and will instead run with monthly reports as a way to be transparent about company progress with respect to bookings, which is their main financial metric outside and of revenue/engagement/developer share.

I expect that this is going to produce some pretty intense price action. I follow this company closely as both an investor and Roblox developer and thought this strategy was quite interesting.

I personally hold a really bullish view on this company. I believe that engagement will go up a lot this summer rather than the somewhat expected decline across some media markets that mostly cater to young adults/working adults.

Kids main consumption/engagement in the market is staying in and playing video games since schooling responsibility is gone. Even when school returns, it's a place for kids to congregate and talk about this stuff. 

# Roblox is basically Instagram for kids and Dave Baszucki isn't a FREAK like ZUCKERBORG. Similar jealousy incentives behind Roblox too. Every kid wants to look unique and not like a default baconhead if you know what I mean.


> Well, envy/jealousy made, what, two out of the ten commandments? Those of you who have raised siblings you know about envy, or tried to run a law firm or investment bank or even a faculty? Ive heard Warren say a half a dozen times, 'Its not greed that drives the world, but envy."" - Charlie Munger 

I wrote super epic 10 page DD on Roblox on the long-term view on the  Developer Studio in case this subject is of interest to anyone. But I'm scared to post it because I might get slam dunked by the automod for the 20 billionth time.

And before you say ""oh ya it's so overvalued it's market cap is bigger than X, Y, and Z"" just take a damn moment to consider that the target market is obviously children, of which there are billions of them. These are customers whose core spend include:

1. Eating and staying alive
2. Clothes
3. Toys 
4. Education

Roblox belongs in categories 2, 3, and 4. Legos earns 5 billion in revenue while Blizzard earns 8 billion. Do the math, the company has potential."
2021-05-16 20:37:20,wallstreetbets,"I've played it plenty of times with my 8 year old. I even played a few of the grindy simulator types of games by myself for quite a few hours to see how the old loot grind of MMOs translates into a kids game. Nothing surprising there. Keep kids engaged until they get an 'awesome thing'. Make new 'awesome thing'. etc  


I see the engagement of games like Jailbreak, those piggy horror stores, Bee swarm simulator, all the pet games, etc, and while making your own content is easily accessible I just don't see how teens can stay engaged with the platform.   


I just don't see how it can grow. I can't visualize it as still around in another 10 years. How do you think the platform is going to grow in that time?"
2021-05-17 01:32:22,wallstreetbets,"As someone who played Roblox since 2011 when I was 12, I can see the development over the years. It still runs on a subscription based model with parents more than willing to buy extra Robux (Platform currency) for the child. Moreover, I believe that the asia market still has huge potential for growth since their revenue in Asia is still a fraction compared to their US and European counterparts.

I still play Roblox from time to time to check out the games and platform and I've realised that there's an increase in the number of kids playing from China, Korea, Indonesia, India etc compared to 10 years ago in 2011. With the growing middle class in the developing economies, I won't be surprised if revenue from these countries/region experience a boom.

TLDR: Asia makes Roblox stock 🚀🚀🚀. Shorties go OOF"
2021-05-16 20:27:55,wallstreetbets,"Buying puts.  Valued twice as much as TTWO, makes no money despite having 40 million users I’m told and is for ages 3-12.  Kids will move on from this like any other gaming platform.  They will not “mature” and continue to play on rblx lol that’s wishful thinking.... did I mention their market cap is twice that of Take Two AND they lose money?!  Puts through Oct..."
2021-05-16 20:05:25,wallstreetbets,Roblox is a true wallstreet unicorn. There is no company like it. Monthly updates rather then quarterly is the biggest of big dick moves. You don’t play that game unless you know your numbers will run to price through the roof.
2021-05-17 00:54:58,wallstreetbets,"Quite simply, in my opinion, I honestly believe RBLX will prove out to be the mega-stock winner out of this years IPO’s, SPAC’s and Direct Listings."

2021-05-16 22:42:51,wallstreetbets,"I've been buying on dips.  I agree with your DD.   Thanks for writing it. 

Saying some stock is overvalued blah blah blah doesn't account for growth, improving margins, etc.   Being negative often looks smart but seldom is long term."
2021-05-17 03:27:07,wallstreetbets,Calls on builderman I started playing in 2008 when it was 2 years old and it was drugs. Kids love that shit I’ll play a few games when I’m bored still. The tards here don’t get it. It still not being profitable is a huge bullish dildo because it means there’s still room to grow.
2021-05-17 05:50:43,wallstreetbets,"I'm going to be catching those $RBLX dips for sure. The CEO, Baszucki, talked about possible opportunities of Roblox besides gaming which is super interesting. Can't wait to see what comes off this!"

2021-05-17 15:49:08,wallstreetbets,Most people think Roblox loses money. But if you just read their financial statement you’ll notice most of their revenue is deferred. Add that back you’ll easily get a profitable company. Which is also how 60-70 dollar stonk price is justified
2021-05-17 16:09:52,wallstreetbets,In it for the long haul on this one
2021-05-17 11:23:59,wallstreetbets,“Roblox is basically Instagram for kids” lol you boomers crack me up sometimes.
2021-05-17 15:46:22,wallstreetbets,(Don’t take my financial advice but here’s my take on it) I think now is the time to buy Roblox. It’s a company that is able to draw in little kids and keep them playing for years and buying things on the game. A perfect example of this is when my little sister got Roblox. She has been begging for more to Robux for the past 3 years! As the game brings in more kids every year and loses close to none you can safely say it will grow a lot over time compared to companies like Activision or Epic Games. 📈📈📈
2021-05-16 23:19:48,wallstreetbets,C) have such a successful custom game akin to dota during the wc3 map editor days that evovled into well... riot games and dota..
2021-05-17 03:58:07,wallstreetbets,"I'm surprised with how much roblox makes that there hasn't been any copycat games with better engines.

Kids are the real money farms, well their parents are but kids will obsess over something a ton and then want it as every gift they get from their parents. I mean just look at how obsessed a ton of kids got over fortnite skins, and fortnite made a giant check."
2021-05-17 11:39:20,wallstreetbets,My kids and all their friends are obsessed and they all want Robux for presents. That's all I need to know.
2021-05-17 11:25:25,wallstreetbets,"Buy your kid some better games, this is borderline child abuse."
2021-05-17 01:11:56,wallstreetbets,"while I never played roblox, a lot of my friends did 10 years ago. they loved it, and it was a much worse game back then

the majority of their current user base wasn't even born 10 years ago when my friends were playing it. one can figure that as long as roblox keeps improving and staying current with the times, the same cycle will play out, and 10 years from now new kids will be playing it

think about minecraft: all the rage 10 years ago, and I'll be damned, it's still popular as fuck. it's the creativity aspect, and the vast amount of things to do within these games that keep kids coming back

im not invested in roblox, but i can certainly see it being around for another 10 years"
2021-05-17 04:07:50,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the DD. In my DD posts I state that many of us can do far better than analysts in wallstreet due to our very real collective experience and on-the-ground understanding of products. This is exactly what I mean by that.
2021-05-16 20:11:18,wallstreetbets,Roblox is right now valued as Activision in Nov 2020. Buying puts is not a gamble at this point.
2021-05-17 19:22:46,wallstreetbets,I think ya'll are underestimating how good/successful the platform actually is

I will use the Adopt Me game as an example.

With 200 RB you can purchase a Squirrel
With 1000 RB you can purchase Frost Dragon

2021-05-17 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"I built a program that tracks mentions and sentiment of stocks across Reddit and Twitter! This week's most discussed and top growing stocks! This post is in continuation of a series of posts I made in the previous weeks. The response I received was amazing and a lot of you were asking for continued weekly updates. So here goes!

**Most Discussed Stocks of the Week**

https://preview.redd.it/4d4qsqg1fiz61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=83455a752058a48e36142935298d3b0975e665eb

GME narrowly edged out PLTR to retain its number 1 position as the most discussed stocks. Both the stocks have very similar sentiment due to the wild rides the stock price had this week. AMC also had a significant jump in chatter due to the \~30% rally the stock experienced this week. Newcomers to the top 10 list are UWMC due to their strong Q2 outlook and buyback announcement as well as Alibaba group whose stock took a beating this week but investors are still bullish on the long-term aspects of the company which is reflected in the sentiment.

**Top Growing Stocks of the Week**

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/n3f1wc23fiz61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6f1f81111ce5e15f436bf6b3648a6c77e4da3ca)

Above is the list of stocks that have exploded in the number of mentions throughout social media. We definitely have some interesting stocks on the list.

**Inovio Pharmaceuticals($INO)** was creating chatter mainly due to two reasons. They filed a joint patent with Regeneron($REGN) for treating GBM (a type of severe brain cancer which did not have a cure till now). The trial results look promising and also there have been some unsubstantiated rumors about Regeneron buying out Inovio. Adding to this, they have also completed Phase II trial for their Covid-19 vaccine which showed an excellent immune response. The USP is that the vaccine does not require refrigeration and is cheap to manufacture which makes it ideal for developing countries. Overall investors seem to be extremely bullish on the stock which is reflected in the sentiment.

**Trade Desk($TTD)** stock declined more than 25% on a single day following the company’s latest earnings report. Even though the company’s revenue climbed 37% compared to the year-earlier quarter, have kept customer retention rates over 95%, and announced a 10-for-1 stock split, investors did not seem to appreciate the short-term future prospects of the company and were expecting an even bigger beat of estimates. The sell-off can also be partially attributed to “Cookie Crisis” - the traditional way publishers and marketers have collected consumer data – through third-party “cookies” – is being phased out of the industry due to data privacy and control concerns. This can be an existential crisis for Trade Desk’s business model.  

**Fubotv ($FUBO)** stock has been highly volatile ever since its IPO in October. The stock spiked as high as $60 but since has fallen to nearly $20. Shares of the company jumped earlier this week due to strong quarterly reports with revenue rising more than 135% and subscriber base doubling from the year-ago quarter. The share price again popped on Friday with the stock finishing up 12.4%. 

**Alibaba Group ($BABA)** has been down \~20% last month. Their earnings report also did not help with the company missing the earnings but beat on revenue and annual active consumers. The company’s earnings were heavily affected by a $2.8 Billion fine imposed by China for Market Regulation. There are mixed opinions from the investing crowd with some believing that the stock is oversold and is undervalued right now vs others believing it’s not prudent to invest in Chinese stocks.  

**UWM holdings ($UWMC)** has been trending due to their quarterly report and the CEO’s announcement to buy back $300MM of shares. Investors believe that the company’s share price is at all-time lows and the company having a low PE ratio and a 5.7% dividend yield makes it all the more attractive. The company is also being considered to be added to Russell 1000 in June which can be a short-term catalyst. 

SOME FAQ’s:

How does the program work: The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about in the stock is positive or negative).

What is sentiment: It's calculated using natural language processing with a modified version of vadersentiment. You get pre-trained models which classify whether a given statement is positive or negative. I have modified it to analyse financial comments also ( eg. Calls, puts, moon, gain, loss etc). It then classifies the statement between -100% and +100% depending on if it's negative or positive respectively. The numbers you are seeing here are the average across all the comments.

Thank you for reading!

While it is antidotal, we are already seeing the ‘pent up demand’ fall flat on some sectors as the supply chain has been severely disrupted.  Small businesses continue to be the ones taking a hit and as a result, I don’t see them doing the hiring or making the capital investments necessary for an organic recovery to occur quickly.  I’ll also add that many small business have been supported by loans for the past year.  As a result, pre-pandemic plans for capital spending have taken a back seat to paying down debt."

Same idea: Get an info edge on data not traditionally examined. 

The black women unemployment rate is a valid economic indicator. Spikes in unemployment of black women trend to be followed by some economic downturn.

2021-05-17 03:59:13,wallstreetbets,Confirmation bias. Of course every crash there will someone who happens to be holding puts. How many people buy puts trying to time a crash only to get blown the fuck out? Do you remember this subreddit buying May puts? People who can do it consistently are incredibly rare - which is why I said it was incredibly difficult.

2021-05-16 20:18:15,wallstreetbets,"And here I am thinking about killing myself at 45 if I don't get a big ten fold play on the markets, because the idea of taking out a 250k loan with a 60k down payment at 2 to 4 percent and praying I don't get ill and lose my ability to work in that time frame legit scares the shit out of me. Just turned 27.

I really should consider the offer my mom who does real estate building in the Dominican Republic offered me. Buy a lot of land for 10k and get an acre at minimum on fertile land and use the other 40k that I plan to save up for a down payment and build a whole house with two levels, and the last 10k for my first year of living expenses. Seems like America isn't for new young people anymore. Only the old who established in the 20th century and their children. Oh well.

Besides that, good for you and go fuck yourself! I'd imagine it's quite fun to be able to live in various states, neighborhoods and climates."

2021-05-16 21:20:43,wallstreetbets,"That's a while lotta nothing, not because the MM IP isn't valuable, it's enormously valuable. However people often confuse what's falling into the public domain, it's Steamboat Willie and the original design of Mickey Mouse. The later designs of Mickey Mouse are protected, which is also why Disney smartly revamps his image every few years. Just look at videos, episodes, movies and drawings of the mouse throughout the decades- he changes, and so too does the copyright protection. But that's not all...

Also of significance is the extreme cultural value that the mouse and his house hold over people.  Non-Disney produced merch and movies will be flatly rejected by audiences that can afford the real thing and likely even attacked by the very large Disney fanbase. For a parallel case study, just look up ""New Coke.""

Not that Disney didn't massively pay for IP protection by shelling out $2.5B for Marvel and Star Wars (a damn bargain) hust in case.  But the Fab Five will remain Disney Mainstays, monikers and moneymakers forever."

In any case, The volcano from Volcano Bay has really made me appreciate what Universale made. Although I dislike parks, now that I don't live in Orlando anymore, any time I drive there and visit, that Volcano let's me know that I am relatively close to everything in the city - I can't say the same for Disney other than the signs.

Yeah I don't get this. Haven't the Marvel shows been based on comics written years ago? The characters and main storylines were already done, they're just making them live action.   
  
I don't read comics, but the background that I've seen shows that diversity and racial issues have always been a big part of the MCU. I'm never sure what people want to see when they complain about diversity. What should a less diverse cast look like?  
  
Streaming wasn't even a major part of DIS before the pandemic. The majority of their business was theme parks. They'll be able to return to that now that health guidelines are being lifted. Plus they'll be able to rely on billions in box office receipts with more people back in theaters. They have Marvel and Star Wars slates with films and shows through 2022. They wouldn't plan that far out if they didn't know that they have the audience for it."

I don't think Disney will be a monopoly, but they are currently far and away the largest in their industry. They are also adapting very well. While late to the streaming party, the didn't need to be early. 

&#x200B;

My main point is I'm not saying DIS is going to explode and dominate, I'm more wary of where Netflix will be in 25 yrs vs. where DIS will be. I'm not as long on Netflix, but not short either. Netflix has the potential to be a major player in the entertainment sector, but they will need to do more than stream. They've already branched out into original content. I think it will take more. Disney has a great moat, Netflix doesn't."

2021-05-17 16:39:42,wallstreetbets,"you may make some good points on an investment side, but allow me to elaborate just a bit on your question.

if you look at any of the movies that I cited you'll notice that all of the female leads are overpowered and don't really have a growth arc. all of them seem born superior and none of them are allowed to actually fail. compare Rey with Luke for example. in the original Star wars movies, Luke had a real growth arc across the first trilogy. Rey meanwhile simply unlocks new potentials when they are needed and consistently wins. in the original Mulan, this girl set out to do something that she had real potential to fail at and during training she did fail repeatedly. she had vulnerabilities. but she learned to adapt and overcome. in the new Mulan movie, this little girl is born with supernatural abilities and simply has to learn to accept and unlock them in order to breeze through her enemies. 

if you don't create vulnerable characters who have to learn and grow and overcome in order to succeed, your audience never truly invests in those characters. and taking it a step further, it also neuters your ability to write a compelling plot. through the new Star wars movies, the male characters are by and large mostly useless. it's as if they were written as an afterthought. and Rey just keeps picking up these new abilities required in order to continue succeeding that completely changed the canon of what a Jedi is. and that's another crucial failing on the part of the writers. in order to invest in a fantasy or sci-fi realm, the viewer needs to understand the rules by which the characters play and the better they understand the rules created through canon, the more rewarding it is to seek characters use those rules and unexpected ways to adapt and overcome adversity. Rey just seems to make up all sorts of new rules as she goes and it totally breaks the dynamic.

now by comparison, take a look at older movies with strong female leads that were done right. the terminator series is a perfect example. in terminator 1, we see a primary female character who is week but has to learn to survive and interminator 2 we see this crucial evolution where she becomes a true badass. but she's never overpowered. and she never loses her vulnerabilities. she simply grows and adapts to overcome the adversity she faces. and as a result, it's one of the best female lead character arcs that comes to mind. in one of arguably the best movies. period. 

all of this comes back to the question of gender equality. that is, how do you make gender equality a real thing on the big screen. well, you do that by writing characters with truly compelling story arcs that embrace the strengths and weaknesses of the gender or race of the character, or in many cases can show a strong minority or female lead accomplishing things typically seen in white male leads. but you don't put these people on pedestals and make them in vulnerable or you lose the ability to write a compelling story. and you definitely don't want to neuter all of your other characters in order to keep the focus on that diverse lead either. 

true equality comes from putting everybody on an equal playing field regardless of their race, gender, nationality, or whatever else. it means treating a black character just like you would a white character, or treating a female character just like you would a male character. all of them need to have genuine depth, all of them need the ability to fail. and that ability to fail is what makes the hero a truly compelling success when they overcome. 

in summary, this is why a whole crap ton of new movies and TV shows lately absolutely suck. the writers are so interested in pushing their political agendas that they've forgotten the core rules of writing a powerful story that will invest their audience in the characters. instead they rely entirely on the diversity of their characters as a golden ticket for success - which it ISN'T.

I believe I mentioned doctor who as an example of the spiral that I see Disney falling into. it is definitely a solid example, and an exaggerated one at that. what we see happening when the first female doctor is introduced into the doctor who series, is a shift in writing style where they make all of these same crucial errors. the new female lead is written as inherently superior on every level, and is aggressively preached as such to the audience. the canon of the series, which is absolutely vital to audience adhesion, is simply tossed around and molded into whatever they feel like. the story lines of each episode are completely dumbed down and lose any kind of real threat or challenge. villains are written in an over the top format, I'm looking at you Alan Cumming, and diverse characters are consistently infallible while white or male characters are written as doofuses and idiots. 

probably the stupidest thing about the doctor who series at this point is how the writers and producers have reacted to the public backlash. they seem to think that because we don't like how the new doctor has worked out, we're just racists or misogynists. in truth, I for one was highly supportive of having a new female lead as the doctor. and the actress they chose seems like she has a solid background with solid skills and could have been a very compelling new doctor in the series. I don't fault the actors and actresses whatsoever. I absolutely false the writers and producers for producing an absolute shit product and thoroughly shitting on their entire fan base. 

Disney is following down that same path. and instead of recognizing their mistakes, they just want to label any criticism as misogynistic or racist. 

so to make a complete circle back, while you may have some valid points on an investment point of view from a business point of view on Disney in general, the above explains why I see no hope for any worthwhile original content in the near future from them in the form of film, TV series, etc."

2021-05-17 00:13:17,wallstreetbets,"It's not a matter of ""agreeing,"" idiot.

Try watching some good movies and learn to be critical of writing or fuck off."

2021-05-16 23:56:07,wallstreetbets,"Makes sense. Thank you for your take. 

Yeah, food for thought really. I too don't know where NFLX is going to be in 25 years. My niche is in software and stories/sentiment about stocks in general. I look at Netflix I see a great engineering team and that's about it.

I don't see how they can diversify and expand. Sure they made a tremendous pivot from DVD to streaming. But they haven't diversified AT ALL. The tech isn't revolutionary and non-duplicatable. And sure, DIS is a giant and conglomerate. Anything that is the entertainment they are into it. 

So, looking at my comment my thesis would be now about streaming in general. The entertainment business didn't virtually have much innovation since TiVo and VCR (yep CD, DVD are iterations of VCR). I don't know what holds for streaming as an industry but moreover entertainment as an industry. I sure know DIS needs sometimes to get crazy growth valuations, for that DIS needs to revolutionize the industry that is highly unlikely.

Again thanks."

2021-05-17 17:27:45,wallstreetbets,"The only Star Wars films I like are the original trilogy. I agree with the issues about Rey's storyline, but that's a storytelling flaw. You always have to have the main character struggle in the beginning to make their journey more satisfying. It's calling out diversity in general that I don't get, and I see it a lot.  
  
Stories about strong women and people of color are a lot more rare than I think people realize. It makes the complaints seem strange and petty to me. Imagine being a black kid watching everyone else dress up as superheroes they saw in the movies. Now, who are your choices? I've been there - you don't have many.

Those movies can also be done well. From what I remember, Wonder Woman was a strong female lead who was born powerful, and it worked. I think the problem is people on both sides watching movies through their own biased perspective instead of just taking the story for what it is. Our societal rules don't apply in a fictional world. Literally anything can happen. It's like thinking the fact that most serial killers in horror films are white men is calling all white men serial killers.  If you're sitting there looking for problems, you're going to find them.   
  
If a movie's not for me, it's just not for me. I don't get mad at the filmmaker for not making the film I want. It's their story. If you want to see real inequality, go look at some old Disney films, Al Jolsen performances, etc. That's something to complain about. Luckily we moved on.  
  
You can do what you want, but I recommend just watching a fictional film or show as something completely separate from reality. You don't have to look for a political agenda. It might change your enjoyment of it."

I rented a villa at animal kingdom a few years back, it was crazy, and that was just one of the resorts in the city they call ""Disney world"". Literally that place is the size of a city. But what happens when they start gobbling up all the content that would have went to Netflix? Do you think that Netflix could make enough original content to compete for streaming subscribers? Plus Disney does live broadcast  across two of their streaming platforms. Netflix doesn't have sports, ufc fights, live TV etc. What innovation is left for Netflix? They may have been disruptors at some point but that position is dead and gone now. It is all competition now for streaming subscribers and I can't see Netflix having much of a long game at this point in the form of Innovation. All that is left for them now is diversification and they late to the game, the streaming service was the easy part."

What most people don't realize about VIAC is that the Archegos expsure may not be totally clear yet.

If you followed the unwinding of Archegos most people don't talk about the 5th bank in the blowup, Deutsche Bank and the mysterious private sale of their Archegos exposure.

[https://fortune.com/2021/04/01/how-deutsche-bank-managed-survive-unscathed-from-archegos-meltdown/](https://fortune.com/2021/04/01/how-deutsche-bank-managed-survive-unscathed-from-archegos-meltdown/)

I believe the mystery buyer(s) of Deutsche Bank shares bought under 39 and waited until the other banks unwound and have been shorting & dumping on any upward momentum in VIAC since Nomura and CS reported their exposure.

How much they have left to unwind is unknown because nobody knows who bought it or why.

Every gap up in after hours trading is quickly driven down before the market opens. Take this morning for example it gapped to mid 40 and already bled down under 40. Same thing happened on VIAC stellar earnings.

VIAC is a good long investment, when is the only question."

Hello! You have made the mistake of writing ""ect"" instead of ""etc.""

""Ect"" is a common misspelling of ""etc,"" an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase ""et cetera."" Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&c.**, **&c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as ""et"" to ""and"" + ""cetera"" to ""the rest;"" a literal translation to ""and the rest"" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase.

2021-05-16 20:49:22,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the work. I've held this bag at 9.90 for weeks now but when it hit 7 I couldn't resist picking up another couple hundred shares. My DD wasn't as thorough as yours but I agree something is about to break open here. I'd love to get my bag and then hold the rest long.
2021-05-16 23:22:50,wallstreetbets,20% swing already in the last week but if it gets back down to lower 7s I may pick some up. Already invested largely in rocket though and like to diversify the holdings a bit. Very different companies and business models but still housing sector and I ultimately give the advantage to rocket with the benefit of the modern approach but UWMC looking like a very solid play especially with the aspects that OP has highlighted. This will be an interesting week for sure moving this to the top of the watch list
2021-05-17 01:12:08,wallstreetbets,So a limit buy at 6.50 for Monday morning is a good move??

2021-05-16 20:17:44,wallstreetbets,Got this $12 7/16 call that's been stinking up my Robinhood alongside a 11/19 $10 AQST..... Thanks for reminding me why I bought in the first place.
2021-05-16 23:12:36,wallstreetbets,"> First, this needs to sustain above $7.5.

The max pain point for 21 May expiry is $7.50 and there are powerful institutional forces intent on keeping it there. The only way this goes up is if people sell their GME and start buying this instead and that's not going to happen lol."
2021-05-17 08:16:04,wallstreetbets,"Fantastic DD, I was on the fence, but why not. 
Let’s make this happen. Price is so low and the divi is attractive for a medium hold if needed."

2021-05-17 17:00:21,wallstreetbets,the cost to borrow average is sitting at 321% according to ortex. I think this puppy has room to grow.

2021-05-17 00:43:14,wallstreetbets,with this one go with the shares...its a sold company bro with a great divy payment... the shares at the current cost are a great value. With shares you remove almost all risk for holding. Calls not so much. Go with the shares and hold it.

2021-05-17 05:48:21,wallstreetbets,Bro no one said its the next gme. We dont expect this to go 1000% in two weeks. But we expect this is a money play doesnt mean gme cant also be a money play.
2021-05-16 20:58:47,wallstreetbets,Its crazy that you got downvoted. This place really has changed. Everyone act like GME isn't still suspended at 160/170 waiting to bust again
2021-05-17 00:18:04,wallstreetbets,"Well, you should be comfortable. This isn't some shitty speculative SPAC. UWMC is trading well below the former SPACS NAV price and at a lower than average PE ratio. The CEO is going to dump his shares when he's previously seen the stock trade at $14 and they just initiated a buyback... and as others have mentioned the shares are locked up for the moment anyway (though they are incorrectly referring to this as an IPO. A SPAC and an IPO are 2 different ways of going public.)"

I've just never heard of delta being used as a measurement for that probability. I imagine the probability it expires ITM plays a large part in determining the delta, but I don't know if it's a truly 1:1 comparison.

I don't know, I'm not a mathematician, but it's interesting stuff! Definitely going to keep that in mind when I'm shopping for contracts."

Pelosi herself invests big in Microsoft right before they get a nice fat contract. Juicy scoops for a journalist but everyone is afraid or asleep.

2021-05-17 07:58:32,wallstreetbets,"Owning debt is actually sort of a hedge against inflation. If they need to print more money, or higher bills then it's easier to pay off that debt. Zimbabwe with their hyper inflation printed 100 trillion dollar bills. You can pay off a lot of houses purchased at our current ""property brothers prices"" with a 100 trillion dollar bill (yes I know that's an extreme example, but it does illustrate the point). 

The problem comes up if you have an ARM instead of a fixed rate mortgage. If your monthly payment goes up while the theoretical value of your house falls then when you are forced to sell, you lose out on the resale and are forced into bankruptcy, liquidation, and poverty. But if you have a fixed rate, then you shouldn't have to worry too much about rising rates as long as you can continue making your current monthly payments. I think most people will be able to. And I don't have the numbers, but I'm pretty sure ARMs are WAY less common today than they were in 07/08."

2021-05-17 08:20:23,wallstreetbets,"Wel i disagree with the second part and heres why. In Canada, we mostly all use fixed rates. The danger aint about the rates changing constantly. The problem is linked to our mortgages terms. We have 25 years mortgages but most (95% of pple) use 5 years terms. The problem with that is that upon renewal, you have the updated rates. So people who bought at their max borrow capacity because they couldnt afford anything otherwise, right now are fine. We had very low rates, like around 1.84% for a while. With these rates, everyone can make it fit in their budget, put in the 5% or scalp their reer to put the initial funds (bit like a 401k ) and as of right now, everything is fine. The problem is that many borrowed to max capacity and the budget is already tight since they overpaid and went into bid wars for their house. And many didnt put more than the required 5% of funds and many dont have more to put in anyway, so the first 5 years, it will almost be 50/50 in terms of interest and what they pay on the house. So in 5 years, there will still be a big amount to pay. And they now have to renew with the new rates. So lets say you bought a 300k house at 1.84% but after the first 5 years only paid 25k on this as the other 25k goes almost all in interests , youre left with a 275k mortgage and you have to renew it to whatever the rates are then, it can on its own change your budget. As i said, the rates went from 1.84 to 2.30 in a few weeks. Knowing that they key rate was dropped below its historical minimum so covid wouldnt kill the economy,  once the economy start running back, the key rates will climb up and the mortgages rates will follow. The mortgage rates alreasy started,  so you can imagine it will be higher than 2.30% in 5 years, when so many new buyers will need to renew. Even at just 3% +1.15%) many wont be able to make the payments. And 3% is low rate it may go higher than this. Our 5 years terms + rates raise will catch up to many. Its a dangerous cocktail , almost like a tickling bomb. 

Now,  you need to add to this the raise of many things, like gas, food, electricity (owned by the govt). And on top of that, the evaluation cycles are due too. Which means many houses will have updated, higher evaluation prices soon. 2021 is the new cycle starting , so you already can expect that all taxes linked to your property value will also go up, adding even more pressure on manys budget. 

So higher payments on mortgage after renewal+ raise of cost of life + raise of taxes due to new evaluation, I dont think most of people will be able to make tbeir payments. Many are already on a tight budget with todays situation. All the raises will surely be too much for a lot of people."

I can't post a pic here, so I'll just say that I'm down about $60k on the shares and about $6.5k on the calls.  I'm wishing I would've sold the shares and spent a little on more options instead.  It would've saved me a bit.  I'll hold until it comes back up though."

this shit is amazing

\-11% and still plummeting"
2021-05-16 23:05:19,wallstreetbets,"So, in all honesty, I stumbled into the WSB CLOV fever dream.  I bought the 10k shares months ago and started selling covered calls.  After a couple months, the shares dropped enough that it was hard to sell calls at a strike that wouldn’t put me at a loss.  My last round of sold calls expired worthless soon after the WSB hype and massive short interest picked up.  When I saw that happening, I let my sold calls expire and bought a large sum on the cheap while holding the 10k shares.

So I’m either getting rich in the short term or holding until the shares pop in the future.  It’s a gamble, but I can see daylight either way."

Always Sunny did it similarly, where the actors weren’t actually playing black people, they were playing idiotic white characters who did blackface.

7:21 PM ET, 05/15/2021 - Reuters  
May 15 (Reuters) - Billionaire George Soros' investment firm, Soros Fund Management bought shares of ViacomCBS Inc , Discovery Inc and Baidu Inc as they were being sold off during the meltdown of Bill Hwang's Archegos Capital Management, Bloomberg News reported on Saturday.  
  
The fund bought $194 million of ViacomCBS, Baidu stock valued at $77 million, as well $46 million of Vipshop Holdings Ltd and $34 million of Tencent Music Entertainment Group during the first quarter, the report said https://bloom.bg/2RUQQJZ citing a regulatory filing released on Friday.  
  
The company didn't hold the shares prior to Archegos's implosion, a person familiar with the fund's trading told Bloomberg.  
  
Archegos, a family office run by ex-Tiger Asia manager Bill Hwang was highly exposed to ViacomCBS, whose shares plunged in March, leaving the hedge fund facing a massive margin call from its prime broker banks. Archegos was unable to meet the call to secure the equity swap trades that the banks had partly financed.  
  
Global banks lost nearly $10 billion from the Archegos fallout. Credit Suisse, Nomura Holdings and Morgan Stanley were some of the banks that were hit.

The 300 million buy back is incredibly bullish as well as the CEO says he feels like the stock is heavily undervalued and he's a buyer at these prices.   


The total value of the float at current price is around 780 million-ish so the company can literally buy back 40ish% of it if they wanted... also its sitting on $1.5b of cash off their recent 800 million net income quarter, with guidance increased for Q2. 

Overall its a strong fundamental play in a cash rich, profitable business with a nice 5% dividend.

The gray area between bearish and bullish is a little over $11, which is one of the most important lines of defense. This range actually holds the line between bear and bull AMC.

The company has many levers of growth - the China opportunity, the expansion into new product categories like cosmetics etc. Thus far, the execution by the team seems to be solid. More importantly, the current valuation seems to be very attractive relative to other higher growth market place players.

2021-05-17 12:10:26,wallstreetbets,They won't have the kinds of margins in any of those spheres to be profitable enough to justify market cap. Especially in an inflationary environment where wages will make their business model even more strained.
2021-05-17 01:28:53,wallstreetbets,"The only Deflation play is hold cash, or buy Long Bonds. Easiest way would just be buying TLT. Oh, and paying off Debt is a good idea as well."
2021-05-17 01:53:44,wallstreetbets,"Another play to get into, probably moreso after a big risk off event happens is traditional healthcare and like nursing homes and shit.  a ton of Boomers gunna start rotting away, and spending all their money on medical bullshit."
2021-05-17 01:38:58,wallstreetbets,"Long bonds absolutely do not lose value. Long bonds rocket when deflation risk off happens. However it is fast, and then reverses fast. You load 30 year bonds or TLT, wait for the risk off event, sell as close to the top as you can, which for TLT will probably be 160-180, then you hold the cash, and start to buy up all the things you want to go long on."

2021-05-17 01:52:26,wallstreetbets,"Wrong. He didn't exactly say it correctly, though. When the demographic shifts to an older population, you have less people with all the money spending it, and less capable workers out in the labor force, so human productivity goes down. Couple that with automation taking even more jobs, and lowering costs and wages, it gets sticky."

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) if you have any questions or concerns.*"
2021-05-17 07:35:43,wallstreetbets,"He said “demographics are going down”, there is a smaller labor pool, and the population is getting older. A smaller labor pool of younger workers means fewer entry-level, lower priced workers, and more later in life, higher priced workers (proportionally). This leads to production price inflation, and as businesses pay more on average for labor, they *may* pass that through prices, leading to consumer inflation."
2021-05-17 10:00:24,wallstreetbets,"Like I said in my comment, he said it wrong. He was wrong about that point. Our population is aging. We will have fewer workers, and more automation. Fewer workers mean less wages being collected as a whole for the demographic, not individually. So it will be fewer, higher paid workers, and a ton of automation. So a large demographic of high earners, and unemployed. Overall balancing to less spending power for that demographic, which is deflationary."
2021-05-17 10:06:06,wallstreetbets,"So you think a large investment in automation, plus higher costs to hire, will be deflationary? That’s not how that works."
2021-05-17 10:30:05,wallstreetbets,"ok, slow down and read for a moment.

Today we have 100 workers, that earn $100/day. This costs the company $10,000, who then sells the daily products for $20,000 for 100% markup.

10 years from now or whatever, we have 10 high skilled workers(Software,engineers) that make $200/day day, and 90 robots that cost $50/day to run after the cost to build them. This costs the company $6,500, who then sells the products for $13,000, but they produce double the amount as before, and make $26,000.

This is deflationary, and has been happening across industries since the industrial revolution. This coming decade, with advanced robotics, Software, and AI, is going to se this accelerate."
2021-05-17 12:01:00,wallstreetbets,"Except I don’t think that will happen. I think they will have just as many employees per $ sales, but they will be more skilled, thus sg&a will reduce profits."
2021-05-17 12:24:34,wallstreetbets,"Well, what you think will happen is another story. I am saying what IS happening, currently, and accelerating. Only so many people can become engineers and software devs. Unfortunately not everyone is capable of moving into the high skill jobs."
2021-05-17 16:49:15,wallstreetbets,"If there aren’t enough of them, that will cause prices (wages) to increase."
2021-05-17 17:33:26,wallstreetbets,"Omg, are you actually retarded? REAADDD. No shit, the wage will rise, but I have said now multiple times, we are talking the demographic as a whole. The high skilled wage can quadruple, but you can still have deflation if 80-90% no longer have jobs. Jesus Christ, just stop. You clearly have no idea what you are even saying."
2021-05-17 19:20:41,wallstreetbets,I know exactly what I’m saying. You’re already seeing it in the marketplace where wages are rising. You think that the trend is going to reverse and companies are going to automate so much? That’s a joke along the lines of sap is going to rid us of all accountants.

Trying to explain vTubers to a layman and explaining vTubers to someone who already knows about idol culture are two different things. I wouldn't tell someone familiar with idol culture that vTubers are like idols, because it doesn't track on more than a surface level.

But it's the best way to get a laymans dick wet because they are usually tangentially familiar with the idea of idol culture.

You seem like one of those obsessive gatekeepey white-knight types though and are the exact kind of person that is the reason I don't tell anyone in real life that I like anime/manga or vTubers."

I'm going to do the same thing, trying to play earnings each day of the week again though."
2021-05-17 05:32:50,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the reply. The only one I acted on was Doordash - big mistake. I really should have stayed the hell away from DoorDash, I let my long-term bias on gig economy platforms cloud the sensible short-term play that should have been obvious. Going to keep doing this though until I get it right enough % of the time, got Canoo (bearish), Wallmart (bullish?) and Home Depot (bullish) are my contenders today."
2021-05-17 10:06:48,wallstreetbets,"Looking at the charts it appears that Airbnb is what you should have gone with. 

Canoo is probably your bet here, because of the market volatility around EVs. Everything else is expected to go up and beat earnings, even though HD has been trending down.

Oh, and I agree entirely with your assessment of gig economy platforms. Trash stuff that's probably going to hit a wall sooner than we think."

2021-05-17 15:11:41,wallstreetbets,"You don’t need the military to replicate an experiment like this. Therefore, you could easily cite me tons of peer reviewed studies in reputable journals if any of these claims were valid. The fact that you can’t means it is bs. Simple as that."
2021-05-17 18:49:27,wallstreetbets,"I never said I believed any of this crap works, but your tax dollars still pay for some research into it. They're predominantly trying to quantify inuition. There's a pretty famous case of a sergeant in Iraq evacuating a crowded cafe because he got a weird vibe from one of the dudes in there. They found IEDs the guy had planted. The sergeant couldn't point to any single thing about the guy or any action he had taken that tipped him off. He just felt like something bad was about to happen. Stories of squad leaders that seemed to have a sixth sense of ambushes or traps have been around in the military since forever but in the US especially from Vietnam. The military wants to know if there's real scientific legitimacy to the claims.

The rational argument for stories like that is that the person subconsciously noticed minute clues in behavior, body language, or changes in the environment that tipped off the conscious brain to potential danger. The slightly less rational explanation is that the humans, or at least some of them, have an as yet unquantified sixth sense. Call it ""spidey sense"", intuition, or pre-cognition. The military is going to spend your tax dollars finding out, and if it's the second one they'll spend more trying to figure out if it's something they can train into their soldiers.

I personally lean more towards the skeptical side on this stuff, but it was fun reading classified reports of the more out there shit the military funds."

2021-05-17 10:58:09,wallstreetbets,CLF is 10% shorted and X is 13% shorted. Good candidates for short squeeze! I like NUE long here.
2021-05-17 10:29:00,wallstreetbets,Yes definitely buy the dips! Long CLF/STLD/NUE and X!
2021-05-17 10:33:10,wallstreetbets,Yes CLF is shorted 10% and is good candidate for a short squeeze!
2021-05-17 10:43:02,wallstreetbets,Yes short squeeze potential! Nice pop today steel going back up after a slight pull back. China said they are slowing production due to environmental concerns then say they are ramping up because high prices are hurting them. Which is it? And does it matter.

2021-05-17 10:37:51,wallstreetbets,NUE and STLD have the better balance sheets than CLF and X do they are less volatile. X has greatest reward potential but with a bit more risk! CLF is 10% short has short squeeze potential!
