2021-05-06 19:56:18,stocks,Any thoughts on $TMST and $GE?
2021-05-06 19:28:52,stocks,My TD Ameritrade account transferred them at opening bell day after.
2021-05-06 19:48:30,stocks,Mine just transferred but they messed up and transferred to the nasdaq listing instead of the tsx one.
2021-05-06 19:24:18,stocks,It‚Äôs not blockchain...it will take a couple (3-5) days maybe longer for it to complete considering the weekend is coming up.
2021-05-06 19:36:35,stocks,"Ok , I use cibc edge. They not very good but it‚Äôs who I bank with, so it‚Äôs easy to move money around. The way tilray is going, my stocks be worth nothing by the time I get em."
2021-05-06 19:25:23,stocks,"Ok. Thank you. Never went threw a merger before. I figured it take some time, and Google was no help."
2021-05-06 19:51:09,stocks,Just like Billionaires dumping stock prior to an impending market (fill in the blank)
2021-05-06 19:16:55,stocks,If a stock goes up 100% and falls 50% it then has to go back up 100% to get back the 50% It lost just to be at the original 100%.
2021-05-06 19:20:58,stocks,"I would like to think that most people already understand this. The problem that I see is that even some of those companies that have gone up ‚Äú100+%‚Äù are still crushing it from an earnings perspective but being pummeled for what seems like no reason other than it‚Äôs value is too high.  Take apple for example. Crushed earnings and laid out its next steps to continue dominating its space, yet drops on all of that good info? Why? I clearly don‚Äôt understand every in and out of the market but why are companies that are beating expectations even at these high valuations being dropped off a cliff? Yet some made up coin with a dog on it is making people a gazillion dollars... the market is some kind of weird all of the sudden"
2021-05-06 19:28:02,stocks,I agree. We are in interesting times and only time can tell what will happen.
2021-05-06 19:58:14,stocks,Spending lots of time with this dog lately. Nothing in the market can beat it

2021-05-06 19:02:56,stocks,"All of these companies are deeply entrenched in our culture and our daily life. They are huge and bursting with money and have massive influence. They are international with many fronts to their respective businesses. So, yeah... long term indeed."
2021-05-06 19:41:56,stocks,"I don't think you can go wrong with any of FAAMG. I think all are very safe investments. All of those companies you listed make up QQQ's holdings. Tesla included, even though I'm not a huge fan of tesla at its current price. QQQ is obviously an option if you don't have the capital to open substantial positions in the stocks you listed.

A portfolio strictly with just them is a little tech heavy though, as there are certainly reliable stocks in other sectors that you can put money into.

CAt, Lockheed Martin, Chevron, Disney to name a few."
2021-05-06 19:05:13,stocks,"I am long on all of them besides Tesla, Tesla is priced way too high and I think at some point it will face a large correction."
2021-05-06 19:03:07,stocks,"I think they have already permeated every aspect of the lives of almost every single American and therefore rightfully have commanded massive market caps. That being said, I do not know how much more growth there could be and the prices are already built in. They are clear monopolies at this point, which could last for decades, but more likely some no names will start breaking in making long term investments not great.

The one caveat that I admit I have zero knowledge in is their ability to expand into foreign markets. I have no idea if they have saturated other countries as well which could be some major growth opportunity. So if it were me, that's where I would do some research."
2021-05-06 19:43:09,stocks,You won't lose money with those.investments that's for sure.
2021-05-06 19:11:30,stocks,Plug is headed back to the single digit and will drag anything even remotely associated with fuel cells with it. Sure looks like they are going to apply for an extension on the 10-K and that will cause a delay for the earnings report. Which will completely destroy confidence in Plug Power.
2021-05-06 18:50:22,stocks,"wait another month, you'll get an even better dip"
2021-05-06 19:05:01,stocks,Fuelcell stock down 66% from highs. Ballard -50%. Desktop Metal -60%. ü§î
2021-05-06 19:03:19,stocks,I keep thinking the same thing. These stocks were talked about every day and now they‚Äôre in the gutter. This seems like the best time to buy. But timing is tough...
2021-05-06 19:13:56,stocks,Wake me when plug makes money. I may sell my puts that day.
2021-05-06 19:15:34,stocks,Interesting take. Any companies you currently like that you think are grossly undervalued?
2021-05-06 18:51:39,stocks,"Just out of curiosity, what makes you think that, IR & Inflation concerns and the implication that has on valuations?"
2021-05-06 19:41:20,stocks,Hahahaaa quite the growth investor (kidding)
2021-05-06 19:08:00,stocks,"I feel that using previous or recent highs as an indicator of value on stocks that are not profitable is a false sense of security or a poor way to assess a value. I do have my eyes on SSYS after selling out of ddd for 6x profit when they ran earlier this year,  but I'm a very selective buyer. I only buy at my price"
2021-05-06 19:13:57,stocks,"Still way overpriced even at the current prices. Zero profits, anemic growth."
2021-05-06 19:16:39,stocks,Certainly a good point moolium. Any stocks you like right now that are undervalued?
2021-05-06 19:35:46,stocks,Yeah my target on SSYS is about 15. I'd like to get them closer to their book due to dilution risk for not being able to generate profit. The IP is definitely worth owning and now 3d printing is out of my portfolio. I bought DDD last year at 5$
2021-05-06 19:25:07,stocks,"My last 3 buys in the last 2 weeks

I just got in INTC. Very low price to book,  Sales,  and earnings.  Dividend a plus.  Looks boring at a glance,  but look where all the other semis are.  New ceo and focusing on new foundrys may have this as a sleeping giant.  I consider it beaten into ""growth"" territory. 

I also did buy GM (prior to the earnings.) Another stock trading low to earnings,  sales, and book.... automotive taking a beaten by the semis so they will bounce after the chips get under control. 

I got in VIAC at 37.40. May add here.  Similar to the other 2 in book,  earnings,  and sales. They essentially raised 2 billion at 80$/ share. Hell, they could buy back the shares today for half and it's like a free raise of 1b in money..(joking here. )

There's a pattern to the positions I've been buying if you notice,  but they're cheap in a market that is so growth focused.  I'm watching a lot of these hyped growth companies,  and will likely buy them in upcoming months when they trade to values where I can profit off the future earnings rather than paying for them in its entirety today"
2021-05-06 19:37:27,stocks,"Insightful and sound arguments, moolium. I see you must be somewhat of an experienced trader. I especially like the GM trade (12x earnings) as the big shark is going to swallow the absurdly overvalued Tesla‚Äôs market share. I‚Äôve seen their EV push getting aggressive."
2021-05-06 19:47:58,stocks,You are correct.  They also have cruise in their IP.
2021-05-06 18:51:48,stocks,"Holding and averaging down as much as I can, hoping the bleeding stops. I went in long term, but starting to contemplate just getting out. There is way to much uneasiness in the market right now. And it feels like it could be a year or 2 before these types of investments show a profit again."
2021-05-06 18:57:59,stocks,"Most of the rest of my portfolio is in commodity equities, which have been booming. I'm gonna try and forget about the 30% I have in ARKK for a few years."
2021-05-06 19:12:24,stocks,By not buying ark
2021-05-06 18:50:59,stocks,I hold shares in arkg and call it a day.

2021-05-06 18:51:42,stocks,"I have a pretty small portfolio, I started buying the dip but it‚Äôs becoming a falling knife and the capitol could be better spent somewhere else. I am holding the few shares I have but it‚Äôs a shrinking part of my portfolio and investing strategy. If it recovers, then it recovers. If not I‚Äôll just use it to offset my capitol gains tax hit from $UTZ and hopefully $VTRS (this is not investment advice)."
2021-05-06 19:37:42,stocks,Sell covered calls and use the premium to buy more shares so you can sell more covered calls.
2021-05-06 19:10:26,stocks,yeah I might sell ARKK if I cant borrow shares to short. I need to call Fidelity and find out.
2021-05-06 19:08:33,stocks,why not hedge?
2021-05-06 19:13:15,stocks,nice
2021-05-06 19:08:25,stocks,go you
2021-05-06 19:08:57,stocks,so qqq puts? thats risky no? Care to share the strikes / expiries?
2021-05-06 19:13:11,stocks,Uhh isn‚Äôt the nasdaq at an all time high?
2021-05-06 19:12:48,stocks,"yeah that was my thought on ICLN. I bought that chasing fomo in January and lost a good chunk. I finally sold it last week at a decent loss and used the capital to open a position in VTI. 

Already recovered half my loses from ICLN so it was a good move. Plus VTI is something I wanted to own for a while."
2021-05-06 19:58:17,stocks,That is the opposite of a hedge.
2021-05-06 19:39:57,stocks,"thats a good one. I would do that but I dont own 100 shares yet, and dont want to do PMCC for now.

What are your thoughts on selling it short?"
2021-05-06 19:56:36,stocks,The rest of his portfolio IS a hedge.
2021-05-06 19:10:58,stocks,"Definitely risky, but if your looking to hedge ark positions, Russell and Nasdaq puts can help you achieve that goal"
2021-05-06 19:24:13,stocks,"Cathie just goes with a high beta, so she‚Äôll outperform in bulk markets, but get crushed in bear or sideway market. That‚Äôs why I like Nasdaq puts (slightly higher beta for an index) and Russell"
2021-05-06 19:18:04,stocks,"the nasdaq doesnt directly correlate ark at all. 

QQQ is up 5% YTD while ARK is down 30"
2021-05-06 19:21:59,stocks,That‚Äôs why I‚Äôd go with Nasdaq and Russell puts
2021-05-06 19:19:15,stocks,there are API for it. Plenty of news API you can find online
2021-05-06 18:58:32,stocks,I'm not sure but after using it a lot I can say that some things are very inaccurate.  Especially the dividends. It is a great place to start looking but I always then go to many other news sources and sites before I buy anything.  I can put together a great list of what I'm looking for and then go through and mark off ones that aren't right for me and it does have some good winners on the screener occasionally.
2021-05-06 19:08:37,stocks,Ill take the list ;) please and thank you
2021-05-06 18:45:07,stocks,On the $35.  Only on the actual gain and not the initial money you receive for the option.  If it expires worthless then it would be $40.
2021-05-06 19:02:10,stocks,Please hire someone to do your taxes at the end of this year
2021-05-06 18:56:53,stocks,Thanks!
2021-05-06 19:16:23,stocks,"Their brokerage will most likely send them a 1099 form with all the transactions in which they can just use something like TurboTax, and fill out the fields.

2021-05-06 18:34:32,stocks,Don‚Äôt worry it‚Äôll get worse
2021-05-06 18:40:00,stocks,Depends why you bought those companies. Did you believe in them long term or did you buy them after they were pumped up? If you believe in the company then hold on and let the loss turn into gains. If it was just a random buy and it doesn't look like the company will recover than I would just sell and invest your money into something you actually believe in.
2021-05-06 18:53:55,stocks,"Its only a loss if you sell 
Right?"
2021-05-06 19:20:50,stocks,"Here‚Äôs how to tax loss harvest like a pro:

Sell the stock to realize the loss.  The next day, buy a deep OTM call.  Cheapest you can find that expires in 30+ days.  Your basis attaches to that call.  Next day, buy back your stock."

> I bought 35 different small-mid cap stocks 


You‚Äôll never find 35 good companies that you fully understand that are excellent businesses with good moats and finances. You especially won‚Äôt find this many in small and mid caps. 


So rather than focusing on tax loss harvesting. I think you should start the process of self reflection and come to a determination on where you went wrong. 


> almost all of them are -80-90% from where I bought them. 


Sounds like you didn‚Äôt find good companies and didn‚Äôt find good times to buy in. Recipe for disaster. 


> I feel like most of my EV stocks that are massively down are due for a rebound eventually and I don't want to miss out on that. 


Ah the good old ‚Äúit‚Äôll come back up‚Äù strategy. This could happen tomorrow, 5 years from now or never."
2021-05-06 19:16:39,stocks,"You made $5k on $65k in 4 months?  That‚Äôs 7.6%. Annualized it is 23%. That‚Äôs epic. Congrats. You beat the market. 

Up to you. If you like your companies then keep them. If they are garbage (I have two, so not judging), I would sell them, offset my gains for tax purposes and be happy with $5K!  And you got an amazingly cheap lesson. I call it win-win-win. And going forward you will do better."
2021-05-06 18:38:14,stocks,It can get worse than -90%? Rhetorical question of course.
2021-05-06 18:45:00,stocks,"I believe in them and still do, even if they went to .01 a share with a market cap of a mcdonalds hamburger I would still believe. The problem is playing this game of limbo might force me into a margin call eventually if I don't keep picking winners to keep making up for the massive losses. Not the biggest deal though if I go into a margin call though since I can withdraw money out of an etf in a separte portfolio to pay it off. so idk."
2021-05-06 19:32:54,stocks,Is this a real loophole? Cause if it is I'll do it.
2021-05-06 19:59:27,stocks,"I see, that actually helps put things into perspective on what I should do. I'll probably sell the stocks that I basically got pulled into by trying to either sell calls or forced to buy because of puts since I didn't do any research on those and I'll keep the rest of the stocks I bought on purpose since the thesis hasn't changed at all excluding 1 in particular. But yeah, I'm studying delta always and gamma when appropriate so that I stop getting forced to buy stocks I don't want. much Anyways, thanks."
2021-05-06 19:31:13,stocks,"Self-reflection is kind of vague, but I get what you are saying. I bought into hype essentially on the premise that EV is the future, I got suckered into buying stocks with amazing premiums from options, and those are the two main reasons for my massive failures unless you can see something else I haven't noticed. What's holding me back from selling these stocks is the fear that it'll go back up especially since almost every single small to mid cap stock on the market has been trending down despite regular indexes going up. So at the same time I might not be at fault for my stock picks as they are genuinely not that bad if what these companies are reporting is the truth. I also thought diversifying was a safe strategy and it mitigated a lot of losses actually. so idk, i feel like the best strategy right now is to keep doing nothing and use whatever spare money to slowly transition into a different strategy such as buying long calls ITM 1-2 years out on stocks with solid fundamentals rather than based on speculation. I should probably wait to tax harvest shortly before the year ends if the stocks are still at a all time low. Not much more I can lose on them anyways so eh."
2021-05-06 19:34:27,stocks,"Nah, a couple days ago I got up to 94k for the third time and I lost most of the gains again. I make the same mistakes over and over probably because I'm insane."
2021-05-06 18:39:59,stocks,Lol -90.1% can suck so much more
2021-05-06 18:44:24,stocks,"The general advice is for finding unique solid plays it to think of stuff you use everyday or products you really like/believe in, couldn't go without.   


For example do you like your shower head? Who makes it? Any competitors? Whats the market for shower heads like in the future? What are their numbers? (P/E, debt, info from their last earnings). Future earnings growth? Healthy dividend? Current management and their track record? Etc."
2021-05-06 19:17:36,stocks,"What do you use everyday? What your friends like? Etc. 


For me I like going to academy sports to get ammo and stuff. So do my friends. I understand their business and I‚Äôve looked over their finances so I ended up buying ASO. 


I use Visa cards everyday. Everyone uses visa and it‚Äôs rare to find a place that doesn‚Äôt accept it. I understand their business, I‚Äôve read their finances and stuff. So I bought V. 


Etc. however I only own 6 individual stocks. The rest is in index funds to hedge against my ignorance."
2021-05-06 19:49:01,stocks,"read peter lynch's One up on Wall Street, he basically describes what the poster below said.  invest in what you know or interest you"
2021-05-06 19:51:37,stocks,"So I actually mentioned this on a post here earlier (it might be worth checking that out as you might see some wider answers to your questions from more people). But I built a DIY stock screener in Excel which is pretty easy to do (just google how to use the Stocks data function). I got a list of 4000ish tickers and dropped them in then brought in the data using excel. You can then start to calculate some of the key ratios.

You can cut it up by sector, market cap, whatever you want and look into things. So if for example I saw the current shortage in semiconductors and I wanted to look at the companies producing them due to the demand, I‚Äôd filter down and have a look at those. You only have to pay for excel which you can use for so many other things (you could do something similar in a free alternative) rather than a screener website subscription. 

There are a ton of sources out there as well, such as Seeking Alpha, OpenInsider or Whale Wisdom which can help with ideas once you have something you‚Äôre looking for. I‚Äôd recommend reading a lot before diving in though as knowing what you‚Äôre looking for is 90% of the battle.  You can take it all further with data from sites like Kaggle (open source data website) but if you‚Äôre just starting out, I think the things I‚Äôve listed cover the basics of where to look."

Granted, governments that get used to deficit stay in deficit because it is easy. They eventually print money to close their deficit.

But saying that issuing and repaying bonds is the same as printing money is fundamentally wrong"

So basicly they adjust the prices of their investments to fair value. I would personally not see this as recurring income for the next years. If the underlying assets go down in price, they are adjusted to fair value and thus will generate a loss.

Maybe you could take a look at the cashflow statements for more details."

Chinese companies as whole have so many investments in other companies, it‚Äôs so hard to calculate their value. JD.com has the exact same issue. They own shares in 3 of their spin offs. So it‚Äôs a tough one. But they are massive and worth way more than their current market cap, Alibaba that is."

2021-05-06 17:31:37,stocks,"Unfortunately, the wash sale rule applys retroactively. So if, for example, I sold 10 shares on day 4, it would be a wash and my day 2 shares would be cost basis adjusted by 6$.

However, as far as I understand it, if I sell my whole position it shouldnt matter, since the cost adjusted shares would still count as a loss."
2021-05-06 16:23:51,stocks,"Wash sale also works retroactively unfortunately. It essentially covers a 60 day window around the purchase of the share.

2021-05-06 15:49:37,stocks,"growth stocks shouldn't have gotten this high in the first place. even after this continuous crash, they're **still** incredibly overvalued. this is honestly a huge relief that the market is realizing these stocks are overvalued imo

all they need is time now to grow into their current valuations"
2021-05-06 19:47:04,stocks,"Definitely market share. An actual huge amount of growth stocks have seen a huge boost in these past 12 months. A lot are in competition with each other in niches that right now don't have a clear winner and are there for the taking.

I predict the volatility will remain in these next few years and we will see a lot of growth stocks lose their massive valuations and others take their market share and rebound to new highs.

Some growth stocks that come to my mind right now:

\- $ZM. I'm bearish on Zoom, I think their only way out will be to be bought by one of the big players. Bullish on Microsoft Teams for this space, I think they have the perfect package, the perfect industry knowledge to dominate.

\- $FSLY. $NET. There are more alternatives in this space, and it's still got huge growth, as all the Internet still does, but I find Cloudflare well suited to take over the market.

Then you also have stocks that are kinda unique and still have room for growth due to the nature of their niche. $ETSY is still very unknown everywhere non-US/UK. $PINS. $CRWD.

I have no idea though, as Matthew McConaughey once said:

2021-05-06 17:11:09,stocks,"Some are, some are decidedly undervalued now. A lot of collateral damage during this growth crash. And that means a lot of quick swing/starter position  potential"
2021-05-06 18:16:48,stocks,"And I do not see that time needed as anywhere near 5 years.  I expect it will be closer to 20-30 years given the crazy valuations.   Even mature companies are now floating around a 3 time normal valuation model.   Hopefully we won't see a crash, but even without it it will be decades before most of these companies can grow revenue and profits enough to justify their current share price.  On something as simple as Price/Revenue which historically has been in the one times range and is now in the well over three times range.  But add more complicated valuation metrics and we are well over three hundred percent over the mean."
2021-05-06 15:38:46,stocks,"Usually it means run away,  sell right away.   In this specific unusual case I think it's fine.

2021-05-06 18:45:19,stocks,"What do you suppose the motivation is for him telling people not to buy BRK? It sounds like you‚Äôre saying BRK is a bad investment and not to buy it, because Buffett said so- which just really makes no sense. He has always been notoriously against the public at large mass buying his into his company- because it creates volatility. Same reason he never split the class A stock, he only wants to really court knowledgeable investors so they don‚Äôt surge in and surge out on whims. And that strategy has led to very stable and strategic growth.

It‚Äôs one thing to say the average investor who knows nothing should buy the S&P. That makes perfect sense. You don‚Äôt have to think or manage risk you just automatically benefit from the collective growth of the market and avoid lots of potentially stupid decisions individuals are prone to make.

But to say you believe warren buffet genuinely believes Berkshire is a bad investment is purely asinine"

2021-05-06 18:51:13,stocks,"I notice you also mentioned he doesn‚Äôt beat the market anymore. And maybe this is the key to why he is telling the average investor to stick with the S&P- because the average investor is not patient.

It seems you think Berkshire is done beating the market. But over the next decade who knows of that will hold true. He has a longer track record of beating the S&P than not beating it"

2021-05-06 19:02:43,stocks,"Seems like kind of naive assumption really. Buffet is acknowledging that he invests in areas he understands which is a handicap when it comes to tech. But that‚Äôs a far cry from saying he lost his touch and has ruined berkshires returns against a market benchmark. 

First off, Berkshire is up more than the S&P for 2021. I say that just to illustrate how time dependent your benchmark is. You can say well he underperformed the previous decade and then I can say well he over performed the four decades prior. 

Second Berkshire sits on a huge cash pool. So if the market dips it positions then to capitalize very effectively, which would most likely lead to them making a big jump over the S&P"

2021-05-06 16:23:18,stocks,Pinterest is actually one the few social media companies that will benefit from the iOS privacy changes because their ad model is powered by data within the app more so than external cookies.

2021-05-06 16:59:49,stocks,"SO TRUE!! I didn‚Äôt realize how awesome Pinterest was until I bought the stock and watched it climb. I‚Äôve been stupidly in and out of PINS and haven‚Äôt made as much as I could if I had just held. I downloaded the app and kinda let it sit there for a few months. 

Last month I decided to redo our entire deck (project on hold because of lumber shortage), but the DIY deck ideas got me hooked and now I‚Äôm on it more than Reddit and Facebook combined. 

It‚Äôs not social media in the sense of connecting people, but connecting people with ideas, designs, and now products. Its cleaner and less annoying than a Google search, and it just connects people to ideas. It‚Äôs a fascinating model and one I think really works. 

I feel crappy my 70p 5/21 will probably be assigned in a few weeks because I know I coulda gotten a lower price, but I see this as a massive and mostly unwarranted short-term correction.

2021-05-06 14:33:34,stocks,You don‚Äôt lose less if you average down and immediately sell.  Do the math - it‚Äôs the same amount.
2021-05-06 14:39:40,stocks,What's the stock. If it has no future might as well sell it
2021-05-06 15:03:03,stocks,"**edited to fix a calculation mistake**

Don't think you can lose less.

let's say you bought 2 shares at $50 = $100

They are now worth $55 total ($27.5 per share) - so you're down $45.

Then you buy 10 shares at $27.5 = $275

You now have 12 shares at a total of $275+$100= $375 total, which gives you a new average of $31.25

If you sell now you will get 12x$27.5=$330.

You spent total of $375 and sold for 330 = 375-330=$45 total loss."
2021-05-06 14:49:55,stocks,"the general advice is never to ""average down"" a losing trade. Unless you really feel that it's undervalued and you want to benefit more from the increase, you're better off either just holding or selling and cutting your losses."
2021-05-06 15:48:25,stocks,Selling two shares for a loss of $45 is the same as selling ten shares for a loss of $45. The average is meaningless.
2021-05-06 14:37:03,stocks,"Well it‚Äôs very easy to average down 2 shares but after your purchase you will still be down $45. It just gets spread across all your new shares. However, with lower average and higher shares even small price movement can put you positive.

The issue is a falling stock keeps falling and you have accelerated your loss.

Each average down will require more shares to move it too so averaging after averaging because it‚Äôs still going down can tank you."
2021-05-06 16:11:38,stocks,"You can't change how much money you lost by buying more. You paid what you paid for those   2 shares and nothing is going to change that. If you don't believe in the company anymore, sell the shares."
2021-05-06 14:40:08,stocks,"The only difference is that your relative loss is less because you change the average buy-in price by buying at the bottom. *The absolute loss will stay the same.*

Otherwise everybody would keep a little cash reserve to bail himself out in case stocks go down."
2021-05-06 16:31:33,stocks,"That's not how that works. If you bought something at $90 and sell it at $45, you're going to lose $45.  Buying a bunch more at $45 to sell at $45 will change the *average*, but that doesn't mean you magically don't lose money on those first two shares you bought at $90.

The same logic applied in a different scenario:

Two guys in a room each make 100k per year.  Two other guys come in, and they make 50k per year.  The average salary in the room is now 75k.  The actual salaries of each person haven't changed."
2021-05-06 17:10:32,stocks,"You only average down if you want to hold it until it goes back up. If you have two stocks at $45 and they are now $25, you lose $40 if you sell. 

If you average down and buy two more at $25, your new average is $35 and you have 4 stocks. Your total cost is $140. You sell them now at 4*$25=$100.  Your loss is still $40. 

If you want to sell right away - just sell. 

If you are waiting for price to go up, then you average down."

2021-05-06 14:42:24,stocks,Yes. You should sell it. Much easier to give this good advice than to do for my own trades. Sell it and invest in something better. Averaging down is only good for long term plays that you think will rebound
2021-05-06 15:02:28,stocks,Depends on what kind of trading you're doing if you're doing long term and truly believe  in this play and think its undervalued. Just average down and keep averaging down until it get to where you think it should be valued. If you are short term holding this one and you don't think it has much of a future might just have to bite the bullet and sell this one.

And by that time Coinbase will have so many streams of revenue... It'll be Goldman Sachs and NYSE and all kinds of other businesses in one. Now, that is my personal opinion.

2021-05-06 15:02:46,stocks," >If you beat 10% in your portfolio it is a GOOD thing

Just wanted to note that just because the average is 10% doesn't mean that if you beat 10% in any given year you beat the market. The S&P 500 grew about 20% in 2020, 81% from covid crash bottom which is probably a better comparison because that's when most new people started investing,  Russell 3000 grew by 20% as well, 87% from covid crash. If you beat 10% last year that's not beating the market, you should always compare your personal returns to the market performance *right now* not the long term average."

Granted I still attempt to beat the overall market, but any return greater than the inflation rate is money I didn't have before, and that's always a good thing.

2021-05-06 17:47:25,stocks,I understand what you are trying to say but I think there is a better of way of saying it. You are saying that if someone had 11% last year is not beating the market just because the average of the market is 10%. However an investing strategy is not necessarily bad if it‚Äôs worse than voo in any particular year. If you can have 11% avg over 30 years then you are beating the market even if one year voo might beat you by a lot. So you should be comparing your investing strategy with voo over a long duration of time. That would give you the best indication of which strategy is best.

The $83 spent on the contract can be thought of as an insurance premium. You pay $83 to insure that no matter how much the price of GME falls, you are guaranteed a price of at least $155.

If GME were to go bankrupt and end up completely worthless ($0 shares), without the put you would lose all $16300.  With the put, you now only lose $883.  $83 from the price of the contract, and $800 from selling at a price $8 lower than what you started at.

You don't need to have those shares if you plan on buying a put option and then selling it when ITM. You need those shares only if you plan on *writing* covered options, which means selling the option yourself (from your personal portfolio) and enabling whoever buys that option from you to exercise and get your 100 shares. Writing puts is the opposite of buying puts, you want the stock to *NOT* drop in order to retain your shares and collect the premium. Of course if you don't have the shares you will have to buy them at market price."

2021-05-06 13:39:18,stocks,"One bad luck black swan event and you're entire portfolio will go to zero. A 20% drawdown will be become a 40% draw down due to margin call.

Imagine you went into FAANG on margin last week when AMZN, GOOG, AAPL and MSFT blew out earnings. They all pumped, and you said: fuck it, lets do it.

Since then, depending on your stock profile, you could have eaten 15% losses in the market. AMZN is down 10% from its peak, and so is AAPL and MSFT. Imagine getting margin called and those 15% losses now turning into 30% because you were on margin. Could you stomach that loss?

This is a risky idea because the over leverage will create an uneven risk/reward ratio for the potential upside. So if FAANG grows at 10% this year, and your margin interest rate is 9%, and VOO grows at 10%, then what? You're taking on huge 50% loss risks for 9% additional gains. That doesn't feel like its worth it IMHO.

In my opinion, margin is more used for short term swing plays where you have greater confidence in the movement. Not for long term holds unless you can absorb that level of risk.

How quickly can you get $200k again? Because if you can't do it fast, then you're going to dick yourself pretty hard.

2021-05-06 13:55:54,stocks,"What is a good valuation?

NET got clobbered today because FSLY put up weak growth numbers and the market reacted heavily.

NET was trading at $25 before the COVID mess took over, and its been on a 3x rocket ship trajectory ever since.

NET has higher margins than FSLY, operates in a more diverse space and has a different value proposition. With a wider base of customers and larger margins, NET may fair better than FSLY in earnings.

That being said, what is a good valuation for NET in your opinion?

The lowest NET has gotten in the past 6 months is $61 on March 8 at the bottom of the bump.

Do you think that's a fair price for NET?

I'm a big holder of NET, and have been adding over the past year. Its a shame to see it get blown up and caught up in the recently reversion to mean of cloud stocks.

As a relative measure, on February 11 NET had their annual report. Their revenue was $431M, up 50% yoy with a cagr of 50% yoy for 5 years. To maintain that growth, NET needs to put up revenues of about $160M. The current estimates are about $130M. If NET misses this price at all, I think it free-falls all teh way to the low 50's.

They're definitely an expensive company, and depending on your horizons getting in at $60 may be a good entry. But with a volatile stock like this, consider a DCA strategy since it can bounce around a lot.

If you do decide to lump sum into NET, consider buying PUTS to hedge against short term bounces."

I'm fairly confident they'll beat earnings if you look at charts like this as a proxy for marketshare: https://w3techs.com/technologies/history_overview/proxy/all (it is still steadily increasing at the same rate).

Maybe next time I'll just take the win and deal with taxes afterwards.

Either way, I believe in NET longterm for sure. Their new products, adoption and expansion is legit. And they have a great leadership team.

2021-05-06 16:49:57,stocks,"Yeah, that's the big issue at the moment. The P/S for this year is over 30 and even next year (based on current Revenue estimates) is still about 24. This is cheap compared to last year but now even growth companies that have a P/S at 10 and less are sold off like there is no tomorrow even with 30-50% growth.

It's a bit like valuations didn't matter to the upside a year ago but now valuations don't matter even if they are super cheap as long as you are somewhere in tech.

This phase will also pass just like valuation to the upside didn't matter in 2020.

1. Goodwill are assets too but could easily be impaired down if say acquisition synergies don‚Äôt materialise

2. Obsolete equipment/inventory/intangible assets may not have been written down and may not fetch the same value as their carrying amount on the balance sheet

3. Depending on depreciation policy, assets may not be worth as much as the company lists them out to be.

These are just some pointers that I thought off. Since book value is such an easy number to compute, I do find it hard to believe that other market participants would not have spotted such an opportunity as well."

2021-05-06 13:42:50,stocks,"So the main issue with ARK is that almost (if not all of) their holdings are currently overvalued. I'm not exaggerating either. Most of the companies she chose do not even have a P/E ratio because they're too young or simply aren't yet profitable. For the minority of companies that are profitable - you're paying an absolute premium for it. Some of these companies have growing debt in spite of higher revenue. Others are funding their growth by increasing their shares, which dilutes the ones you own and depreciates their value. 

Some people are misguided thinking that ARK investments are inherently safer due to them being ETF's. That's not the case when all of her companies follow that theme of ""disruption"" at the cost of being way overvalued.

They're going to go down a lot more before going up again. Might as well put that money to better use and consider moving into ARK at a later date."

Now that everybody is afraid it's a toss up whether it's a value buy or reason to run. If you're risk averse at all I'd avoid them and I check the ark holdings and tend to becareful if i trade anything in them.

2021-05-06 12:38:00,stocks,"You're making it harder for yourself than it is. Think of an ETF as a conglomerate of fractional shares of the holdings, which are stocks that comprise the ETF.

So even if no one buys the ETF, its price is determined by the price action of the underlying (fractional) shares. Vice versa: if people buy the ETF on a dip, it will contribute to higher prices since the ETF creator has to buy more shares for the new customers, effectively supporting the stocks in their holding."
2021-05-06 13:02:53,stocks,"The market value of all the underlying holdings of ABC is called the Net Asset Value (NAV). You can see this on the website of whatever company issued the ETF. 

Yes its true that the price of ABC can fluctuate from its NAV, i guess you could call it a kind of tracking error. But the reason this error never gets to significant levels is that traders will jump on the difference, so ABC's price will always tend toward the NAV. Ie. If the ABC is trading at $25 but NAV is $26, it's an easy buy."

My advice? You have 40k total to put somewhere. Take 30k and put it into VTI/VOO. Take the remaining 10k and find four stocks you REALLY REALLY like. Stocks which you are passionate about and can talk someone's ear off at a dinner party. Buy $2500 of each of those stocks and see if your picks outstrip your VOO/VTI benchmark. Every 6 months or 1 year, rebalance. If your individual stocks are doing great, transfer money from them into VOO so you have a 75/25 split. If they're doing like shit, consider whether they're still good bets, then rebalance again by selling VOO and buying more stock.

I think that methodology gets you into the game and lets you consume a little more risk than VOO has to offer, while giving you an avenue to learn lots about the market, companies, the economy and whatnot."

For that last point it is important to note that while their Medallion Fund has returned 60% for the last 20 years, they don't allow the holders in this fund to compound returns (they are only allowed to have a certain amount invested, if it gets above that amount they have to pull profits) which is why they don't have a titanic amount of capital.

You're new at this, no matter how much research you have done you don't know what you're doing and will make mistakes. Putting your money into an index fund will give you good returns along with the security of knowing with 99.999% certainty that if there is a dip it WILL recover (and if it doesn't you probably have bigger problems to worry about). It will also help you get used to the ups and downs of the market without getting emotional.

**Step 2: Start paper trading**

Most brokerages offer a ""paper trading"" account. These are accounts where you invest with fake money and can track how you would have done with these investments. I know you're excited and want to start investing now so you can make money, but you're new and will likely fall into one of several common pitfalls of new investors, better to do this with fake money than real money. And besides if you follow step 1 your money *is* invested and you are getting good returns.

**Step 3*: Start using your 10% cash to make real stock purchases**

 Once you do well after a few months to a year of paper trading (it seems like a long time I know but trust me the stock market will still be there when you're done), take some of your remaining capital and start buying stocks. Real investing is not like paper trading when it comes to your actual money, keep that in mind. You will find yourself panicking for the first time here, that's fine, remember the vast majority of your money is in a solid investment with little risk and good returns.

**Step 4*: Start moving more into stock picks**

After a few years of doing well with your 10%, if you feel like you'd rather pick your own stocks over using an index fund then start moving money out of your total market index funds into individual stock picks

And that's it, that's (in my opinion) the best way to get started in the stock market. Any additional tips from you guys?

*These steps aren't actually necessary, you can just leave 100% of your capital in total market index funds and you will be fine, in fact that's what I would recommend you do but I realize that many people, especially those that come to this subreddit, would rather take their chances and try to outperform the market"

So $9,450 into VTI and $4,050 into VXUS or $13,500 into VT. Then take the remaining 10%, or $1,500 (plus your $200, so $1,700 total), to trade stocks.

2021-05-06 13:54:35,stocks,">Whats the best total market index for someone looking to retire in 20-30 years?

Any US total market index will essentially be identical to any other, with the exception of expense ratio, so for the most part as long as it's from a reputable company it's fine

>Should one change their index investment every so often?

There are two answers to this question, the first is that if you invest in multiple index funds covering multiple areas (US Total market and World ex-US Total Market for example) you will need to occasionally rebalance. So if you put 70% into US total Market and 30% into World Total Market, over time those percentages will change as they grow at different rates. You should then ""rebalance"" or in other words sell some of one and buy more of the other to bring them back into your target. For example if US total market grows to 75% and World Total Market drops to 25%, you'll want to sell some of the US and buy some of the World to bring it back to 70%/30%.

The second response to this question is more in regard to your retirement time horizon. If you're planning on having a very long retirement (40-50+ years) you'll want to keep your portfolio exactly like this (100% in stocks, nothing in bonds) otherwise you run the risk of running out of money (with the trade off of high volatility in your assets that you rely on for income). If you are planning on having a standard retirement lengths of 15-30 years it may be wise to move into a Bond Index as you approach retirement age."
2021-05-06 14:20:01,stocks,"look into target retirement funds - you can buy a like 2040 or 2050 target fund, and it will be automatically allocated and rebalanced to a pretty-dang-decent allocation for someone retiring at that date."

2021-05-06 13:32:11,stocks,"I trimmed my ARK positions by half. I had big issues with ARKK as I was reviewing their daily buy/sells. ARKK eventually started buying many companies within my own circle of competence. They bought way too many incredibly overpriced IPOs and SPACs. I would never want to buy into a SPAC that has already gone up 40% over NAV. I would never want in on Coinbase at IPO price, due to their lack of moat. There are other tech companies that they also buy that I'm not a fan of - PLTR for both financial and ethical reasons. Companies like COIN and PLTR are problematic to me because of their extremely high P/S ratios and are valued like mega growth companies - but I have serious issues with the growth stories of those companies. PLTR has extremely troublesome management with extremely high insider selling, all the while issuing enormous stock grants to insiders at the detriment of shareholders. Those stocks were priced in and a half.

ARKF is probably my favorite out of the bunch, as it has the most reasonable buys with lower beta. I also like ARKG (despite the lack of liquidity) and ARKW is alright. I haven't had good experiences with ARKQ, and ARKX is a bit of a joke, as they take the space theme too liberally."

Another note: the market has really already priced in whatever growth these companies can possibly have. I mean look at Tesla‚Äôs market cap compared to all other car companies. In order for there to be a solid chance of growth in value, they have to perfectly meet/exceed expectations. Hence why they are considered such speculative stocks."
2021-05-06 16:20:11,stocks,"Well, ARK is a pretty speculative fund, if you check the fundamentals of the companies what they own and then compare it the price of the companies then you will see that ARK sits on a pretty massive bubble.

You should try BERK-B or VOO or VTI. But EBIX and VIAC is pretty undervalued for example. I know huge gains in a short time and shiny techy stuff sounds intriguing but I think if you earned enough money and you don‚Äôt want to risk the bubble to pop, then look for other investments.

Her traders appear to me to be inexperienced, frenetic and hasty. It looks like a shop without adult supervision.

2021-05-06 18:24:05,stocks,"> After being on the cusp of insolvency I don't see why airlines will spend on new fleets - they'll likely get as much use from the current ones as possible.

This is one of the main reasons I bought some shares of AER right after they took over GE's aircraft leasing arm. My theory is that many of these airlines who sold off their fleets are going to lease instead of buying back their fleets outright, at least until the industry can get a better picture of what post-COVID air travel will look like.

I also think you're absolutely right about the business travel too. My fiancee's stepdad used to travel all over the world for his job, pretty much constantly, but his company told him he probably won't take another business trip for the rest of his career since it's so much easier/cheaper to hold meetings remotely. Some of my other acquaintances have said similar things about their work traveling. Granted, there are plenty of traveling workers who can't work remotely, but I have to imagine many businesses will continue to use video conferencing over travel simply because it's so much cheaper and easier (albeit a bit of a PITA if you're dealing with very disparate time zones).

In terms of the actual impact on the industry, [this article I found on Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/041315/how-much-revenue-airline-industry-comes-business-travelers-compared-leisure-travelers.asp) says that roughly 12% of the total air travel (by volume) is business-related, but it can account for 75% or more of an airline's profit, particularly on certain flights/routes. There's also the point that only 60% of revenue across the industry comes directly from passengers, while the other 40% is from frequent flier miles, which are overwhelmingly used by business passengers, so the financial impact might be even bigger when you consider the impact from reduced collection/redemption of miles. (This also factors into the lodging industry as well, as many of them have lucrative rewards programs that are, again, widely used by corporate customers.)"
2021-05-06 14:10:00,stocks,"Yep, ARK can‚Äôt hurt you if you don‚Äôt check the price."
2021-05-06 17:17:57,stocks,"Well, i can see where you‚Äôre coming from. I do think though that she was able to spot the correct growth stocks early really well. Now, ARK funds have had a huge runup, and they are correcting (whether it‚Äôs an overreaction or not i‚Äôll leave in the middle) and will likely underperform this year. I do think though that she adds some very interesting stocks to her funds (Like Lilium, Velo3D, Teladoc, etc etc), of which some i could see outperforming the market in the upcoming decade.

On the other hand, i also see so many questionable picks, like Skillz and Virgin Galactic. I also see that she has been adding more and more to her highly speculative plays (of which some are years away from real revenues). This is however in line with her strategy. I actually wrote something about this earlier, and you should be able to find it in r/stocks. 

Whether you believe in that strategy, that‚Äôs up to you. I feel like the market environment the upcoming years will be way less advantageous for growth stocks compared to 2020. I do think that some ARK funds (like ARKF) are quite nice long term holds though."

2021-05-06 17:34:01,stocks,Agreed. Another thing- many people have racked up ridiculous amounts of miles over the last 1.5 years on their credit cards. I don't think I'll have to pay for any airfare for at least 2 years and I travel a fair amount typically. I guess I don't really understand the relationship of airlines with credit card companies but I have to think that's going to hurt the airlines pretty bad.

2021-05-06 11:15:38,stocks,"Hey, sorry to hear about your situation. It is very frustrating to have potential gains that evaporate on you so quickly. We are in a market that‚Äôs punishing growth stocks and stocks with poor fundamentals. With that being said I would review the stocks your invested in and ask why did I invest in this and do I still believe in them long term? Do you think they can bounce back? Then hold. The idea of quick gains in the market, while possible is unlikely. For some a passive index fund is the way to go. You‚Äôre not the only one in this boat. Hang in there! Luckily you‚Äôre young and have a lot of time left, wish I had started that early."
2021-05-06 12:22:28,stocks,"It is normal for noobs to start out buying penny stocks.  When people have little experience, they look for quick ways to make large gains relative to the small amount of money they start out with.  So they bet on long shots hoping to double, triple, ten-bag their money in short order.  After a while, hopefully after not losing too much, they graduate to investing.  That means buying good companies and measuring performance not in weeks but in quarters and years.  If held long enough quality wins out.

Taking your loss and moving on would not be a bad choice.  Penny stocks are mostly pump and dump scams.  Waiting for one to come back up the purchase price can be a very long wait...if it happens at all."

2021-05-06 11:29:50,stocks,Unless you truly believe in any of your penny stocks...ditch them.  Reinvest (as others have said) in fundamentally solid value stocks.

2021-05-06 11:31:16,stocks,So you are only really down 350. Not bad for a first effort. Take a step back and a deep breath and re-evaluate your positions. Maybe let us know what companies you are investing in and someone here might have real advice on what to hold and what to let go.

2021-05-06 12:37:31,stocks,"Pennystocks are very volatile, that's why you can make and lose a lot of money with them in a short period of time. My suggestion would be: Take a look at the companies you have bought and ask yourself, if you believe that the company has potential for the future (good business-model, innovative product etc...). If the answer to that question is no, I'd rather sell and take the loss. What's the point of holding stock of a company you think is crap?"
2021-05-06 13:18:53,stocks,"If you''re doing long-term investments and these are good companies that you've done your research on that will provide you value in the long term, then ride it out. If you haven't done your research you have to decide if you're going to do your due diligence and figure out if they're worth keeping or move your money into something else. (I'm guilty of this myself, I have about 5% of my portfolio, which is about comparable to yours, in a company I bought based on their industry and market conditions that I haven't gotten around to researching yet to figure out if I should take my small profits or stay long term. I know I need to do it, I just haven't had the time and presence of mind to do it at the same time.)

Everyone loses money in the beginning, what you need to do is figure out *why* you lost money. For example, I learned pretty quickly that I'm just going to lose money trying to do day trade or make short term investments because I simply don't have the ability to follow those short term trends around my day job. So I needed to switch my strategy to long term investing. I lost money, but I reflected and got something of value back out of that."
2021-05-06 13:59:43,stocks,"Its good that you only used a few grand. You could lose it all and youll still be in a better position before you started trading cause now you know to stay away from bs guru‚Äôs. 

My advice is you can either keep trading with your remaining money until it goes to zero or until you make a profit. Or you can take it out now and buy a good company like msft, aapl, disney etc. Either way i hope you learned a lot."

2021-05-06 13:07:17,stocks,Learn how to read SEC filings. They can help you know the health of a company and help you not overpay and find value plays. Before I invest in any company I read through their filings and make sure they are rock solid.
2021-05-06 12:02:09,stocks,"No problem! I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything funny about losing money. Ignore the people making fun of you, not worth your time. Just based on the fact that your stocks have lost 50 to 72 percent indicates that you started positions in very volatile stocks. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with that. Some people purposely enter small caps because those are the stocks that theoretically will give you higher returns. But obviously they come with the risk of greater loss. With that being sad the decision is 100% yours. How will you feel if you sell and it jumps up another 20% the next day? Or how will you feel if it goes down another 20%? These are all factors you have to consider. Ultimately the decision is yours. You have to live with that decision and be okay with the outcome. Anyone who tells you they know exactly what‚Äôs going to happen is lying to you. My advice if you decide to sell is to delete the stock from your watchlist and don‚Äôt even monitor it. Sometimes ignorance is bliss in those cases. I think it‚Äôs a good learning experience for you. The stock market is a volatile place but make informed decisions with conviction and don‚Äôt look back!"

I mean... DJIA Jan 21 was 31,176. today it is 34,368  + 10% since Biden took office.

S&P was 3,853 on 1/21/21 and today it is 4,175 +8% since Biden took office. 

Nasdaq was 13,530 on 1/21/21 and today it is 13,517 is down about one tenth of a percent since Biden took office. 

Dude... Biden has nothing to do with your losses. Quite blaming shit on anything but yourself. you are trying to absolve yourself of responsibility and say it wasn't your bad picks, it must be Biden's tax policies, none of which have actually come to pass, it is all just conjecture at this point. 

So... end WHAT? the overall stock market IS NOT DOWN! DJIA and S&P are at and around all time highs and up YTD.  NASDAQ is flat. There is not, nor has there been, an endless downward spiral. 

Open your eyes and look around. You picked bad stocks. period. Tons of stocks are up. Tons of things are making money. Man up and own your own mistakes. Trying to pass this off on a president floating an infrastructure plan, which in itself will likely be a massive stimulus in it's own right, my make you feel better about yourself, but it is not helping you.

Because the stock market isn't crashing, the s&p is like 1.5% off its all time high and is up 9% since February.

Nasdaq is down 5% from all time high which is hardly crashing, and is about flat since February.

Russell 3000 is down about 2% from ATH and is up about 9% since February

Russell 2000 is down about 6% from ATH and is up 4% since February.

2021-05-06 00:00:00,stocks,"Some key technical levels on popular stocks Looking at the charts of some of my popular techy stocks and many of them are approaching important technical levels (which I'll explain below).  That doesn't mean stocks will definitely hold or rebound at these levels, but they do represent key inflection points: holding at these levels increases the likelihood that the selling is done, while failing to hold these levels suggests further selling is likely.

DOCU: Bearish cross of the 50/200 day moving averages a couple of weeks ago, and is now trading below a declining 50 DMA and a flattening 200 DMA.  Both bearish signs.  However, the stock has pulled back to a key demand level in the 185-190 area.  The stock has previously held this level 8 times over the past year, and hasn't traded below it since late June, 2020.  Holding this level is really, really important for the stock.  If it fails, there is no support level and we could see a long decline.

ETSY: Just posted some kick-ass earnings but getting punished like most stocks on concerns (which are totally expected) of slowing growth compared to COVID growth rates.  However, the technical damage isn't nearly as bad as in DOCU.  The stock is trading well below the 50 DMA, which has recently turned down, and today is gapping down below the rising 200 DMA.  ETSY hasn't traded below the 200 DMA since the original COVID crash of March 2020.  So the stock needs to rebound here and reclaim the 200 DMA.  If it can't, the next stop could be the demand area of 115-130, which is another 18-20% down from here.

PINS: Similar to ETSY in many ways, posted kick-ass earnings but expecting growth to slow compared to COVID numbers, and also trading well below the declining 50 DMA.  It is now testing the 200 DMA, which is still rising, and like ETSY it needs to hold this level.  If it doesn't, there really isn't a solid demand zone until we hit around $35, which is more than 40% below current levels.

TDOC: This one is a technical disaster. Bearish 50/200 cross recently with the 50 DMA sharply declining and the 200 DMA now turning down. Lost a recent demand zone and is now testing the next one.  Further weakness from here and we could see a long decline, like DOCU.

Happy to look at some other charts by request."
2021-05-06 11:18:58,stocks,Thoughts on SPOT? I'm not a technicals person but still interested in your thoughts since I follow this one closely.
2021-05-06 14:25:05,stocks,"TDOC is down to March 2020 Levels basically just when the pandemic started, I don't know, I think we are far from ""normal"" and if it's testing these levels we are in a good spot, I could see $125 TDOC but that would be the floor. Telehealth will be part of our daily lives moving forward, maybe not as much in peak 2020, but it's here to stay."
2021-05-06 11:03:03,stocks,DOCU is a covid play so this was to be expected
2021-05-06 12:12:09,stocks,"Looks a lot like DOCU actually.

* Very recent bearish cross of 50/200 DMA, with declining 50 DMA
* 200 DMA flattening
* Stock trading well below both
* Currently right in fairly solid demand zone. Failure to hold this level could see a decline to the next demand zone around 180.
* Also not a good sign that recent down days were on higher than normal volume."
2021-05-06 14:39:43,stocks,"If it's down to pre-pandemic levels, that means it's priced for pre-pandemic growth.  In other words, that none of the pandemic growth will carry forward.  I find that very hard to believe.

I do think many of these stocks are in the midst of over-corrections because investors are mistakenly assuming that all of the pandemic growth will just vanish and they will all revert back to pre-pandemic growth.  Money will pile back in when the earnings report beat reduced guidance and they start to guide upwards again."
2021-05-06 11:17:23,stocks,"No it isn't, like many companies it was already growing rapidly and COVID pulled forward some of their future growth.  Right now people are overreacting to what was always obvious: these companies can't continue to grow at the rates they did during COVID."

2021-05-06 00:00:00,stocks,"Why is the general consensus that it is better to buy & hold even when the market now is moving at a faster rate than usual? I'm not saying I'm Michael Burry or Warren Buffett. But I sold ETSY @ 220 and FSLY @ 100. I didn't like their valuations, and  150% gains in just a few months was unreasonable though welcomed. So I secured the bag. 

Unfortunately, I didn't follow my own advice for SPCE, BEPC, and ENPH

I'm not saying try to time the market. But eventually we all want to sell our stocks for profits down the line. If the market is moving at a faster rate, doesn't that mean we should sell sooner than usual?"
2021-05-06 10:59:17,stocks,"Because most people freak out and fiddle with their portfolio and lose money.

2021-05-06 11:00:26,stocks,Lol how the hell are you making all these 150% gains and complaining?
2021-05-06 11:43:06,stocks,"You dont know wether its gonna rise even higher, you just dont know.

Buy & hold is recommended because stocks in general go up, but because of fees, spread and suboptimal entry and exit points buying and selling fast diminishes that.
Buy & hold minimizes these effects."
2021-05-06 11:08:07,stocks,"Buy and hold is about not trying to time the market, but it does not mean not to rebalance.  So if you were a buy and hold investor that did regular timed rebalancing that would cause you to sell part of the ones that were way up like that and to buy other ones that were not up as much.  Your allocation should include some percentage of cash as well, so some of the rebalancing would involve adding to your cash position when the market is way up."
2021-05-06 13:32:26,stocks,The stocks you bought were speculative ones plain and simple. Selling is not wrong. The buy and hold strategy works best with companies with real earnings on the table and a good business which you believe will run for many decades. Therefore if you believe this to be true then theres no reason to sell on a whim unless you dont have faith in which case you should have bought the stock for a long term investment anyways.
2021-05-06 13:55:45,stocks,"Yes, but this is so difficult to do. I sold some at a good price, but then I also sold LAM for meager earnings, and it rocketed from 540 to 668 very shortly after that.

The buy & hold strategy is a grossly oversimplified approach to an incredible complicated system.

I'm not saying it's wrong. I'm not saying I don't understand it. I'm not saying that it doesn make sense sometimes.

It is not a miracle solution that always works. 

Same thing with ""don't try and time the market""

The entire market is overvalued, there was a double top pattern on the NASDAQ chart (just like there was a head and shoulders last time it tanked), people are selling off, etc.

If I looked to buy here, I would be trying to time the market.

If I looked to sell here, I would be trying to time the market.

Ideas and idoms and strategies make sense.

Understand them. Use them for your benefit. Don't just adhere to them.

2021-05-06 00:00:00,stocks,When to cut losses? I am a new investor and have no idea when to cut losses. I bought companies like PENN and ARKW 15% from their 52 week highs thinking i was buying a dip but the stocks arent recovering. PENN beat earnings and revenue and the stock still is down 8% on the day. And ARKW is just getting beaten to a pulp everyday. When do i cut my losses. I feel like im too far deep but i also think i bought into meme stock hype. Ive read books saying stocks can always go lower and if i think that a stock can recover i should by the shit out of it. Alas i have no money left to invest.
2021-05-06 10:35:38,stocks,I cut losses when I feel like the stock isn‚Äôt gonna go up anymore no matter how much it‚Äôs down. And then just put it into apple or VTI
2021-05-06 10:52:03,stocks,"I cut most ark funds. Admittedly, Momentum was a factor for buying and I like Woods ideas about investing in disruptive companies. The problem I had was that she has the same investments in different funds and her entry points seemed to be poorly planned. After 3 months I was getting a little weary as that was the time I allowed to stabilize. Once coin base came out, extremely overpriced IMO, and she jumped in with a large order, I sold almost all of it. If the company is doing things you don‚Äôt like then better to cut losses with your loss of confidence than punish yourself by holding."
2021-05-06 10:45:59,stocks,"Don‚Äôt think of it as cutting your losses. Re-evaluate your options and decide if you think you can make more money staying in or investing elsewhere. That‚Äôs the criteria. When you base decisions off of already losing in a stock and hoping it recovers, you‚Äôre think emotionally not logically."
2021-05-06 10:37:51,stocks,"Technical indicators like RSI, bollinger bands, and 20/50/200 day simple moving averages may help you as a trader.

2021-05-06 10:50:11,stocks,"It all depends on your goals. Are these stocks long term investment purchases or are you trying to trade for short term gain? 
It's good to have your exit strategy before you buy. If you're looking for a hard rule for ""how down is enough before I sell and move on?"" the answer is different for everyone and every stock.

2021-05-06 11:18:30,stocks,For me I cut losses depending on the support or resistance level. I keep it simple. Ex. For longs if it breaks a key support I cut losses. But you have to manage it in a way to minimize your losses as much as possible not through the quantity of trades that you make but rather the quality of it.

2021-05-06 10:47:45,stocks,"Logical follow up questions could be about what they said for forward looking guidance. Big money is looking for relative safety generally speaking right now. Companies with high price to sales/earnings have gone out of style. If you‚Äôre still really into the thesis, consider selling out-the-money covered calls or even buying the dip.

I do not have a position and am not as read-in on those tickers as you are, so take my advice generally and not literal."
2021-05-06 12:36:31,stocks,"Just looking at the chart for this stock, it went up almost 250% from its Feb2020 high to Feb2021. Stocks don't only go up- there's also valuation. That expected overperformance was likely the reason it went up in the first place, so it's already priced in.

If you believe in the company continuing to grow, you could stay in. But it seems like the market is doing more and more profit-taking after all those immense gains, so it might continue to go down more in the short to mid term too."

2021-05-06 00:00:00,stocks,"Has tech got you down? Consider commodities, in particular, steel. For a variety of reasons: Steel manufacturing companies are set to make record profits in the next few years. Demand is up huge. [The post-COVID boom is starting.](https://www.appraisalbuzz.com/biggest-construction-boom-since-2006-best-2-weeks-for-rates-in-a-year/) The rotation out of tech is under way. And analysts are finally coming to their senses and raising estimates of steel companies, because:

-----------------------------------

**Steel prices are obscenely high**

These are literally record high steel prices. This mean serious profit. Imagine if people were willing to pay Apple 2 to 3 times as much for an iPhone. [Price of steel 2009 ‚Äì 2021](https://i.imgur.com/2sRd8M1.png) 

And this is not just for the moment, but for the rest of the year and beyond. There are record high steel futures as well, and they are only rising. [Future steel futures](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/metals/ferrous/hrc-steel_quotes_globex.html) 

This means that people expect steel prices to be high in the future. They are paying these prices right now for steel months away, because they expect this locked-in price to be cheaper than the actual price of steel (however many months/years away).

--------------------------------

**Inflation**

The hot topic right now.  [Global economic rebound is fueling a blistering commodities rally.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-01/the-price-of-the-stuff-that-makes-everything-is-surging?srnd=premium)  Will the Fed be able to control inflation? Many expect inflation to climb regardless as there has been so much money printed. During periods of high inflation, Michael Burry thinks you want to be in [real estate and commodities](https://twitter.com/BurryArchive/status/1363909572243705859/photo/1). 

And even if inflation doesn‚Äôt cross 3%, the fear of it will drive people to hedge part of their portfolio in commodities.

------------------------------------

**China's rebate**

In 2020, China produced 56.5% of the world‚Äôs steel. This was helped by a 13% rebate on all steel exported. Sell steel for $100, get $100 from the buyer and $13 from the government.

But now China wants to cut their steel production to deal with smog. 

Starting May 1st 2021 (6 days ago!), there is a now 0% import tariff & 20-25% export tariff on materials. This is great news for vertically integrated steel companies like CLF and MT than mine their own ore. Not great news for other steel companies that need to buy iron ore- the price of ore is already high and now it‚Äôs getting a lot worse.

Starting May 1st 2021, the Chinese rebate for exported steel will be cut from 13% to 0%. If China is cutting their steel production, they still want to grow and build, so they want to keep as much steel inside China as possible. This is amazing news for steel companies outside of China, as their major competitor‚Äôs product just got the equivalent of 13% more expensive.

**Where in particular to invest?** 

Steel in general will make a killing in 2021 and beyond. A commodities [supercycle.](https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1r0r28fl471c5/are-we-witnessing-the-start-of-a-new-commodities-supercycle#:~:text=Commodity%20super%20cycles%20are%20decade,their%20long%2Dterm%20price%20trend.)

There is good reason to look more closely at CLF (US company) and MT (European company). CLF recently jumped 10% a few days ago and is now consolidating. CLF is generally more of an upward pointed rollercoaster while MT is a gentler climb.

CLF and MT are vertically integrated and mine their own ore. For the most part they have better financials than many of their competitors, and have invested more into their futures. MT is actively buying back shares while CLF's CEO LG said on his last call they will ""look after shareholders"" after aggressively paying down their debt. It won't take long, they are making a ton of money.

CLF has the benefit of a firebrand CEO, Lourenco Goncalves, who actively looks out for investors. Additionally, the U.S. infrastructure bill is going to require an incredibly large amount of (US) steel. In the short term, speeches involving this bill and the passing of the bill will be major catalysts, and in the long term the profits from the bill will be reflected in earnings reports for years.

As people seem to put (far too much) weight on short interest, some might want to know that CLF has short interest of 11.26% as reported by Ortex. Those shorters are hurting and are going to need to buy their way out soon. 

MT released quarterly earnings today and did amazingly, beating already sky-high estimates by an additional 20%. Their best quarter in a decade. [Commodities Boom Grips Steel](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-06/arcelormittal-reports-best-quarter-in-decade-as-steel-joins-boom) 

And these amazing Q1 numbers don't even fully account for the new record high prices. Steel's day is just beginning. This is not a buy-today and sell-tomorrow play, this is a buy-sometime-soon and hold-for-a-long-time play.

Positions: I have shares and LEAPs in CLF and MT at a variety of strikes."

When you look at the green melt-up they've been experiencing and *then* you buy in, do you think you'll be profiting off of revenues they've already made as the shortage started getting real and they initially flared their prices? Or will you be subject to supply-adjusted revenues regressing towards the mean as they dive deeper into their shortages?

I actually don't know the answer when it comes to steel, but with lumber - another favorite at the moment - I wonder what people think they're buying into in this industry where supply replenishment takes quite a while."

-------------------------------

**Potential downsides for both MT and CLF (steel in general):**

* Inflation doesn't happen and tech resurges. People keep throwing their money at high P/E growth companies and steel doesn't climb that fast, even with record profits. Profits don't increase share prices, demand for shares increases share price.

* A new COVID variant ignores vaccines and the world goes back into lockdown. Construction will slow tremendously, and with that, steel purchases.

* General market collapse. This is a long term play. I'm buying Jan 2022 LEAPS because I expect profit to keep coming, Q2, Q3, Q4 of 2021 and on. If the overall market collapses (there are plenty of whispers about this ""everything is too overvalued"" etc) then we won't get the max return from this play. I may be holding LEAPS in October when the Feds abruptly raise rates and everything falls 30%. Note: Feds have stated that they're keep rates low for a long time, the understanding to be at least all of 2021 and 2022.

* It is a short lived commodity cycle and we are at the peak. In my opinion this is the least likely event as we have steel futures to tell us that prices are expected to be high for months/years.

-------------------------------------------------

**Potential downsides for just CLF:**

* The loss of the CEO. Lourenco Goncalves is an amazing long-term CEO, the center of CLF, and if he were to pass away in a car accident tomorrow the stock would react poorly.

* CLF spent a bunch of money to acquire Arcelor Mittal's US facilities last year. It made them the largest flat-rolled steel producer in North America but also saddled them with some debt (and MT now owns 78M CLF shares!). So they have debt, but they are paying it down aggressively so if there is a downturn in future years, they will survive it easily. The debt may make some investment funds hesitate, although companies like U.S. Steel are far far worse off and would be screwed.

* Steel tarrifs make it more expensive to import foreign steel into the U.S. If Biden repeals the United States steel tariffs, CLF will instantly lose a huge competetive advantage. That said, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said recently, ""Those tariffs have worked in so far as they have leveled the playing field for American producers of steel and aluminum. I'm not saying they're perfect. They created other challenges, but the fact of the matter is, China doesn't play fair.""

* The Infrastrucure Bill falls through. While steel doesn't depend on this, it is a nice bonus that would be missed. The failure of the bill would mean we wouldn't see those steel profits and also may trigger a price drop in CLF."

So you're saying Jan 2023 leaps is the way."
2021-05-06 16:47:53,stocks,"The thing is, your attitude is the same attitude as the analysts who don't believe in steel.

A week ago, CLF was trading at the same stock price it did at the start of the year. Back then steel futures were ~900. Now they're reaching $1600, and the price a week ago had barely moved. 

Even though steel futures weren't priced in, whales and big players weren't buying in because their analysts were telling them that steel is a short-term play, these profits are temporary, until production catches up to shortages.

Those knowledgeable about the steel industry, know at best it will be many months until shortage problems are over. And with enormous fundamental changes to steel coming like Chinese export reduction, global infrastructure bills, these problems are going to be exacerbated, and for many years.

PLUS steel companies learned their lessons in the past. They won't overproduce. At the end of the day, steel companies are bringing in billions, their stock price hasn't been reflecting that despite the melt up, because analysts don't believe it to continue. But every month futures go up, every month where steel has record breaking earnings, every credit upgrade of steel companies, it doesn't matter what analysts think - steel companies are extremely profitable, bringing in billions, using it to expand or give back to shareholder, and with no end in sight to the bullish steel market, anyone buying in now is getting in early.

Looking at market and industry behaviour in 2008/2009 and early 2020 though, something tells me it‚Äôs going to change and possibly abruptly with the interest rate and the selloff that comes with it. Steel may still be up but the share prices may drop with a slowed demand, which should eventually correct the steel pricing. Economic and infrastructure recovery post-covid will be the wildcard here (and the timing of it). It could prop everything up even amidst a rate hike.

This is a black swan event.  Prior to Covid manufacturers ran their inventories to record low levels so if they want steel they now need to go to the market.  

Now let's look at how amazingly tangled our global market for steel is:

\-Shipping is still expensive and restarting from Covid

\-You have record stimulus already available and that is not including the upcoming EU stimulus AND US Infrastructure plan.

\-China has made it a lot less economical to export from their market.  They also have been shutting down around 5 mts per month of production between two of their provinces alone.  

\-Tariffs are still in place!

2021-05-06 00:00:00,stocks,"Did I make a mistake buying RKT? Their stock starting tanking in after hours, after their earnings call. I don't understand why, it was a narrow miss of just $0.01 a share. 

I know they are a bit of a meme stock, but I began adding them to my portfolio after the price settled following the pump and dump at the end of March, because I felt it was a good play.

I was looking over the call transcript and am just seeing more reasons to be bullish, in summary - their goal is to be the leading retail home mortgage provider in the next two years, have a 90% customer retention rate, were voted one of the best workplaces and have a liquid position with positive cash flow.  

Some of the fundamental indicators like price to sales ratio of 2.3 looks on par with some financial companies (WFC, JPM). Compared to other internet/tech companies they are a big value play.  PEG of 0.24

Planning on holding for now and considering adding shares at market open at a discount.

Anyone care to offer a bear case for RKT? What am I missing here?"

2021-05-06 09:01:04,stocks,Absolutely not.  RKT is a long term hold.  Look back in 10 or even 20 years and you'll be very very happy.  Buy hold forget.  It's not a trading stock.  Yes it was a meme stock for like a day and it happened a couple times but that's over.  Buy and hold.  You won't regret.
2021-05-06 09:51:47,stocks,"I don‚Äôt see anyone in this thread talk about its lack of economic moat. It has a ton of competition, and is certainly not shielded in any way from that competition by providing some drastically different service to its consumers. It also has heavy pressure from established heavy weight banks who obviously want to protect their bottom lines. 

Is RKT a bad hold? Maybe. I sold at a 30% loss and happy I didn‚Äôt hold any longer as it would‚Äôve been about a 50% loss now. I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable averaging down and possibly catching a falling knife. I learned my lesson and now use my time warning people of possible pump and dumps. 

Lastly, I think it was an orchestrated pump and dump by u/thebigshort2020. He‚Äôs trying to do the same thing with POSH, another bullshit stock. As soon as the stock skyrocketed, he sold and left everyone holding the bag."
2021-05-06 11:26:07,stocks,">their goal is to be the leading retail home mortgage provider in the next two years

I fail to see how this is a positive.  Goals don't matter, if they can execute on the goal does.  If you think they will be the largest retail home mortgage provider in the next two years and you think that value will warrant a higher share price, then buy the stock.  If the market agrees with you, then you will see value in the short term.  If the market disagrees with you, then you will see loss or inactivity in the short term.  If you are right, then you will see value in the long term.  I think what you are seeing right now is that the market doesn't agree with that sentiment.  Not necessarily that they can't deliver on being the largest provider, but that being the largest provider won't provide the value expected, most likely because they anticipate a downturn in the mortgage market.  Who knows if they are right, but if the market is wrong you will make bank in the long term."

2021-05-06 11:19:35,stocks,"I'm in real estate, and there are 20 buyers for every seller in my market. It's a crazy time in the market. Higher rates will crimp people, but they're not that high relative to rates pre-pandemic. A few years ago, I had a mortgage at 3 3/8%, and everyone I knew was over 4%. I refinanced at 2 3/8%, and I'm glad I did. 

I don't think it's realistic to expect ultra low rates forever, but I don't think interest rates ticking up will mean people will stop buying houses. I agree the rush to refi may have passed, and that's ok. Higher rates might mean there are 14 or 16 buyers for every seller, but houses will still be bought and sold. 

RKT is making some other strategic moves to cement its position, including proprietrary software, auto loans, etc., that should help offset some of the 'slow down' in refinancing. That said, even with lower guidance, the company is making bundles of cash and they are in a great position."
2021-05-06 09:32:54,stocks,Yallen recently announced that interest rates may be going up. Who will refinance at a higher rate? I guess thats why theres quite a pessimistic outlook for this market in general.
2021-05-06 13:29:15,stocks,meme stock?? they have been a leader in their industry for like 30 fucking years before their IPO.....
2021-05-06 13:54:19,stocks,"Yes, RKT is a mistake. Mortgage rates have nowhere to go but up from here, and with the housing shortage, there are less loans being taken so their primary income is from refinancing. This means their profits are not likely to grow as they're not going to be able to continue underwriting as many loans as they are now. 2020 was likely a high. Will they grow long-term? Sure. They may be a decent company, and they may be doing quite well 5 years from now, but will they be able to beat the market? I highly doubt it."

2. Rkt with its platform and performance overall I'd suggest it's a long hold not a short term play ESP when what it's trying to do with its app process and overal p/e is at healthy place. 
3. If you're paper hands because of a little bit of change then regardless maybe reconsider whether or not betting at the casino...investing in general...is really what you should do or you should pay someone to manage it. 
4. Zoom out and look at the bigger picture. If you done your proper research and you think what you got is trustworthy then just go sip a beer and be back in a few days or weeks and see how it goes.

We expect the following ranges in Q2 2021:  
Closed loan volume of between $82.5 billion and $87.5 billion.  
Net rate lock volume of between $81.5 billion and $88.5 billion.  
Gain on sale margins of 2.65% to 2.95%."
2021-05-06 11:23:53,stocks,They issued not-so-great Q2 guidance that indicates a significant drop in new loan originations. Tied to their assumption of rising interest rates. This stock is likely to slide as Q2 revenue is going to be down.

2021-05-06 09:19:36,stocks,"True, they addressed this in the earnings call and stated that half of their revenue comes from non-mortgage loans, that housing equity is still at the highest levels its been in the past 15-20 years.  They also mentioned that this was a record 1st quarter.

They are at no risk of losing market share currently as they‚Äôve shown they are continually growing. The company has been around since the 80s, they will be fine. This past year was just an exceptional anomaly for earnings. They will still continue to be an industry leader and YES, I think, my opinion of course, this sell off was an over reaction on rates. This will rebound but it could be years before the talks about rates become a far distant memory and people start realizing oh wait this company has always been very profitable and has huge market share and growing."

2021-05-06 09:59:47,stocks,"That‚Äôs pretty well explained.

Quicken Loans specializes in writing shitty loans that are super high risk for default. Barely any credit score or down payment requirement. If you have a job and can sign your name - you‚Äôre probably going to qualify for a loan regardless of your credit history.

So - the reply is saying - some of these loans that RKT are giving - should the housing market take a turn (which is likely on some level) and these loans start to go belly up RKT/Quicken are the first loans that will likely go sideways given their requirement to secure a loan is lower than most traditional mortgage loaning companies.

I don‚Äôt know any of this to be true - as I don‚Äôt have any real knowledge of RKT and their business model - but I was explaining what the reply was saying."
2021-05-06 09:56:17,stocks,"Empty offices, businesses shutting down, and the only thing keeping this thing afloat is government spending. Also the CLO is a prett frightening thing, as it has replaced the Mbs that caused 08.

I think so. They can be the best, most innovative company in the world and growing market share like crazy but it's not going to help when their market contracts by 30%. 

I think you're seeing investors scramble to price in rates that will be higher faster. Jay even said on the call that the bump we saw in only a few weeks in Q1 was an increase they expected to see over at least a year. 

Lower originations & lower margin = lower revenue = lower profit = lower stock price.

Saying higher rates is ""returning to normal"" and not ""hurting their business"" is just arguing semantics"

2021-05-06 00:00:00,stocks,"Reuters on electric vehicle maker Volkswagen: VW throws down the emissions gauntlet (VOW, VWAGY) [How low can you go? Volkswagen throws down the emissions gauntlet](https://www.reuters.com/business/sustainable-business/how-low-can-you-go-volkswagen-throws-down-emissions-gauntlet-2021-05-05/)

Excerpt:

> Three sources told Reuters that Volkswagen, which owns car brands including Porsche, Audi, VW, Seat and Skoda, is quietly letting policymakers in Brussels know that it would support more ambitious cuts in emissions than other car manufacturers.

Further:

> Volkswagen has set itself a 2025 deadline for overtaking U.S. pioneer Tesla (TSLA.O) and becoming the world's biggest seller of electric vehicles (EVs), a plan that includes building six battery factories in Europe alone by 2030.

Details:

> Tensions over emissions cuts came to a head at a board meeting of the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA) in March, two people familiar with the matter said.

> Several chief executives said they were concerned about the prospect of tougher EU standards, as they could blow a hole in profits from fossil-fuel engines that could not yet be plugged by electric vehicles, the two people said.

> But Diess took a more upbeat view, saying his company's EVs would achieve cost parity by the mid-2020s, a comment that raised eyebrows among fellow CEOs at the meeting including Renault's Luca de Meo, one of the people said.

Also:

> At the moment, the European industry must deliver fleet-wide cuts in emissions of 37.5% by 2030 for new passenger cars from 2021 limits - equivalent to a reduction from 95 grams of CO2 per km this year to 59 g/km at the end of the decade.

> One person familiar with the matter said the industry was now bracing for this target reduction to rise to at least 50% when the European Commission unveils its plans.

And:

> Selling mass-market EVs is also vital to earn valuable carbon credits that carmakers can sell to rivals struggling to meet EU emissions targets.

> EV champions can even make a business selling credits to heavy emitters. Tesla, for example, sold Italy's FCA European and U.S. CO2 credits worth 2 billion euros from 2019 to 2021, and green credit sales helped boost its first-quarter revenue."

A friend wanted to order one and it is already backordered for months here in Chicago. VW will blow Tesla out of the water within 10 years.

2021-05-06 00:00:00,stocks,"I started investing in February 2021. How do I ride out the storm when im losing my own initial investment? I didnt get to invest in 2020. I finally started in Feb this year after my friends kept telling me how easy it was to make money in stock market all their stocks were up at least 50%. So I am not sitting on gains. With how the charts on many of the tech/growth stocks look like. It is looking like I bought all my tech stocks at their ATH many of them are now down at least 50%.  

How do I ride this out? It feels like things are going to worse. And it also isn't the easy mode my friends were talking about  they had in 2020. I'd feel better if it was gains I was losing and had that cushion. Im currently down 40%. It would be worse but I got lucky with the Dog coin and put some of my money in SPY/VOO."
2021-05-06 08:29:08,stocks,"I know a lot of people sell the stock market as a ""get rich quick"". But the truth is you're only going to make others rich quick with that mentality.

&#x200B;

The correct mentality (but it obviously doesn't sell/appeal as much) is thinking in YEARS not MONTHS. You got in February 2021, congrats. There is so much for you to learn. So many industries. So many financial instruments. Learn, learn, learn. But the truth is you've been in the stock market for only 2 months. That's nothing in stock market time. You have to start thinking in years.

&#x200B;

Invest in companies that will be good in 3, 5, 10 years. If an investment goes down -10% in 2 months, think to yourself, does the reason I bought this stock still hold up in the long term? If yes, buy the dip or chill out because you've got confidence in the stock. If not, just sell it.

&#x200B;

So much about the stock market is more about being able to control your emotions and having the correct risk/reward management than actual stock picking."
2021-05-06 08:44:17,stocks,"I got a large chunk of money for investments last year Jan/ Feb. I decided I didn‚Äôt want to DCA to spread it out because most times you‚Äôre better off just throwing your money in the market ASAP. 

Little did I know, Feb 2020 was the ATH before the covid crash. Most of my investments ranked 50%+. You really just need to look at the long term rather than the short term. My airline investment was down ~70% but I decided to buy more as it came down to lower my cost. Every paycheque I started putting more and more money to work and eventually everything recovered. 

Your friends are lucky to have missed the crash in 2020 and entered near the bottom to make easy money. Just take this as a lesson to not sell in the future, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll recover with time. Time horizon matters a lot with investing. It wouldn‚Äôt be wise to throw all your money in growth stocks now if you retire tomorrow for example."
2021-05-06 08:23:11,stocks,"Unfortunately you came in at the top, and if you‚Äôre down 40% you‚Äôre going to need gains around 65% from the current point to have profits. 

If you look at your portfolio and that doesn‚Äôt seem likely to you, you should consider either investing more to average down or cutting some losses.

If you had a long mentality when you bought, and your reasons for picking those stocks have not changed, then why exit? It‚Äôs only been a few months. I would say give everything a year at least. My general rule is to never buy any stock I‚Äôm not willing to hold for at least one year."
2021-05-06 09:19:10,stocks,"If you bought stocks you answered your question with your question.  How do you ride it out?  That's it exactly.  Just ride it out.

Don't you wish you would've gotten in 5 years ago? Well just stay for 5 so you're not saying that next time.  

If you got caught in the weed pump and dump and panic sold,  then bought a bunch of apple calls for 132 when it was at 129 just to watch it dump to 116 over the next few weeks, so loaded up on nio calls to make up the difference only to have a major chip and production shortage and now you've literally lost 80% on expiring options and are betting the rest on oil and gas this summer, then I still say just be happy you're here because time in the game is what matters most."

Seriously you gota stop looking and worrying if you can‚Äôt do that then pull your profits and stop investing for your own sanity, investing isn‚Äôt for everyone and that‚Äôs fine.

Equally recognise you bought at the end of a bull market and things are stabilising and may even dip a lot more, if that‚Äôs okay with you then carry on, if this isn‚Äôt okay for you then you need to do more DD before investing."
2021-05-06 09:26:06,stocks,"I also started investing recently as the GME thing was going on. I expected losses and considered it the cost of learning how to do this shit. I‚Äôm now down around -$1500 from a $8800 starting point.  While I‚Äôd obviously prefer to NOT be down, I feel like I‚Äôm doing OK given that I‚Äôm learning as I go. 

Diversification is key and learning how to do research is obviously important but I have to admit that it seems to me so far that the fundamentals of a company don‚Äôt necessarily mean it will perform well day to day. I know they are still important metrics so I stay invested in the stock even if it is down. There have been too many times I have cut my losses only to watch the stock value bounce back a couple days later. 

Stick with it.  None if us with only a few months experience should expect to be making hand over fist kind of money."

If you think the stock / ETF / Fund has long term value at or above where you bought it (QCLN / ICLN as an example of one that has gotten wrecked recently that this sub was hyping), general consensus would seem to be to just leave it in and ride it out. Otherwise why did you buy it?

I'm far from an expert, but I decided for myself that the money tied up in turd stocks was doing much less good than a more reliable ETF."

If you can handle the loss financially for now then I'd just wait it out and then start researching a new approach to investing in the future ... so you're not as susceptible to market swings."

If you want to stay for the long term, don't do anything yet before you fill the knowledge gap. Stop looking at the broker app and read some books.

You need to step back, invest in something less risky or continue holding, and educate yourself. You need to have a plan, and part of that plan needs to be dealing with situations where get way up or way down on investments. 

My advice: hold and sell covered calls or sell and buy blue chips. In the meantime learn about why the market is doing what it‚Äôs doing"

2021-05-06 11:15:22,stocks,"Welcome to the family. You‚Äôre doing great, even if it doesn‚Äôt feel that way right now. This stuff is hard. I‚Äôve had months were I‚Äôve lost six figures. On the flip side I‚Äôve had months where I‚Äôve had six figure gains. You have learned your first hard fought lesson: there‚Äôs no such thing as free money. Now it is up to you if you take advantage of that expensive lesson. Here are some of the things I‚Äôve learned over decades of doing this stuff. As usual, this is not financial advice

**Know why you are investing**

What is your investing objective? Making money for a down payment on a house in the next 3-5 years? Saving for retirement in 30 years? Trying to outpace inflation? Want better returns than your savings account? All of these objectives result in different strategies. Know what you want and refine your strategy research  

**‚ÄúTime in the market beats timing the market‚Äù**

This is a core guidance for investing. Investing is a years long game. I‚Äôve been investing since 2005ish. Just gotta commit to it. There is no such thing as easy mode. Sometimes you get lucky, but other times you don‚Äôt. If you believe in your positions just sit back and ‚Äúhodl‚Äù

Another benefit to holding is that after 1 year you convert from Short Term Capital Gains/Losses to Long Term Capital Gains/Losses. This has tax implications. Basically LTCG are taxed at a lower rate, and are preferable. 

**You won‚Äôt beat the market**

There are tons of people way smarter than us that are backed by billions of dollars of infrastructure and even they can‚Äôt predictably/consistently beat the market. Your best bet, statistically speaking, is to hold broadly diversified index funds like SPY. It isn‚Äôt as sexy or fast as GME-memes or anything, but it is consistent. 

**Don‚Äôt invest more than you can afford to lose**

This should be self explanatory, but there it is. If it is easier for you to stomach, consider your entire investment an expense, meaning that the money is gone (in your head). That way the dips might not affect you as much because you‚Äôve already ‚Äúspent‚Äù the money. 

**Keep learning!**

Learn about investment strategies (lump sum vs dollar cost averaging, tax loss harvesting, etc). Learn about market trends. Learn about mutual funds, learn about the difference between small/medium/large cap stocks and companies. Learn about growth vs value stocks. Learn about asset diversification and asset allocation. There is an industry out there that is worth billions and billions and dollars. There is always something new to learn. What lessons have you learned about your experiences so far? 

**Do your own due diligence**

It‚Äôs great to talk to friends about stocks. Sure. But don‚Äôt take their word at face value. They don‚Äôt know any more than you do. Make your own decisions based on your own critical thinking and research. Also, your situation is not their fault. You decided to invest. Don‚Äôt let this come between you as friends. Same applies to family

2021-05-06 13:14:36,stocks,"Here‚Äôs my take as someone who‚Äôs also down 40% of my initial investment. I started investing in mid 2019 with a very small investment of about $100 to get my feet wet as I was barely starting to learn the very basics of trading. I honestly wasn‚Äôt very active and held through for a while without making too many changes. I practically forgot about my portfolio and didn‚Äôt check Robinhood for like a year and a half. I made a nice couple of bucks from holding Aphria, Snapchat, and Sony. My mentality and strategy changed in early January of this year when I got back into trading actively as I started to hear about the GME craze. I hopped on the bandwagon and rode the wave up, but I held on for too long as I didn‚Äôt know when to take gains. It was too new for me seeing an insane profit thinking about how much higher it could go. Fast forward a few weeks and things crash, I doubled down, rode the wave back up and got greedy again missing my chance. Throughout the time I was trying to catch every new WSB hype play and depositing more and more money. I learned about options and started gambling on risky plays. As they say the first hit is free and I was addicted when I got my first 400% return on a few small plays. It wasn‚Äôt enough to counter my losses in premiums and selling bad stock purchases. I‚Äôve put in about $8.3k and am down $3.2k. Since then I‚Äôve spent more time doing my own research and read the news everyday. I took the time to analyze where I went wrong and I‚Äôve learned to hold onto plays I have higher conviction in and to take gains when I should. I have a bit to go before breaking even, but I know I can get back there with a more risk averse strategy and hedging. Sometimes you have know when to let go and when to avg down and buy the dip. It will help if you don‚Äôt check your portfolio every single day if your plays are high conviction long holds. I‚Äôm still swing trading and holding long, but I‚Äôve taken my losses and learned from them. I‚Äôm sure you can too."

There is lessons you need to learn i already knew about. If you time the market, buy some stocks, your buy in price better be decent.

A while ago every single post was about Palantir, BlackBerry, Nio, post after post after post after post, it just went on for days, months, eternity.

And look at that, after soul crushing long wait the retribution day is here, reddit hype stocks on 40% discount, time to buy is now while normies are bleeding crazy red. Its not time to buy when everyone is happy and driving on endless hype, well it always depends on situation.

For example while i was late on GME stock when it first hit 40$, the upsides and risk taken overweight everything else, and after the long weekend i bought in, sold later around 300$, but at some point there i wanted to buy in again. I mean i am not some wise guru, if the short squeeze happens the stock rises endlessly with no ceiling, fucking moon is not the ceiling, it would rise out of solar system, but i didn't buy in because buying a stock after 7000% rise up no matter the hype and doing all the DD went against everything i known, i said good luck to everyone else and soul crushingly avoided buying in it again. Lessons i learned let me escape with insane profit while the masses piled in with their buy in price above 300$ just before disaster.

I am not sure if you can just simply ride out the storm, you have to learn the lessons given at you, you have to think, analyze and not do any dumb shit anymore, nobody is going to make me back 4k i lost on a dumb ass penny stock in 10 sec for the most dumbest reason to invest in it there could be, there was just no sun shine, no silver lining, there was just pain and reality, but you know, after year of good decisions after good decisions, i can say those 4k doesn't matter to me, just a blip in history, my mind doesn't ever go there, what would that money be, what could i done with it ? ehh, i did well afterwards with everything i learned, in twisted way soul crushing loses just helped me.

You just ride it out. It's up to you if you want to sell and consider it cutting your losses, but don't treat this as a game of darts where you're hoping to hit something and it rises up in days or months.

It also sounds like you invested money you weren't comfortable with losing. You'll have to go in with the mindset of a responsible gambler in that you should be fine with losing that money...if for no other reason in that you wouldn't even be touching it for a *very* long time."

Amazon is a crazy outlier there, so make sure you understand why they are an outlier before buying the stock. This might require digging into financials, etc. 

However, do not chase low PE or high PE companies! It's just a rough way to see what premium the market is willing to pay for a share of profits. 

One way to think of PE ratio is that this is the number of dollars of stock you must buy to own $1 of their profits per year. (PE ratio changes over time, of course)

2021-05-06 12:39:44,stocks,"Get stubborn. Tell the stock, ""Fuck you, I'm not selling."" The secret to the stock market is time. If you are holding solid companies, over a long enough time frame they likely will go up. The chance that you bought AAPL or MSFT at the absolute, all-time top is pretty low.

Selling covered calls is another option. But you need 100 shares. You can collect a premium as a way to slowly reduce your cost basis. It's also a way to force you to think long term. It also puts you in the position of feeling good when the stock doesn't go up too much because you pocket the premium and keep the shares.

Stocks do tend to move together. So a lot of tech is down in the last few months. If there is something else you'd rather hold, maybe something more boring like QQQ, you could sell and buy that instead. That way you keep your money in the market to benefit from any bounce."

If it‚Äôs the stocks I‚Äôm thinking of you need to DYOR more and realize why those stocks are called ‚Äúmeme stocks.‚Äù It‚Äôs because they‚Äôre joke companies that ran up, meaning they‚Äôll run down just as big. 


A book on stock picking to get you started on the right track would be ‚ÄúOne Up On Wall Street‚Äù by Peter Lynch. You can also watch Warren Buffett/Charlie Munger interviews when he gives advice, I find those to sometimes be helpful.

Secondly, if you're playing around with Doge Coin, that probably isn't a good long term play either.

Lastly, investing is just that, investing. If you buy quality names, with solid growth prospects and brand name businesses, then, over time, you're going to be hard pressed to lose money. 

I know it's redundant and not very sexy but understanding balance sheets, income statements and reading earnings transcripts is a very important, fundamental, way to learn how to invest. 

I like your play of buying the VOO / SPY btw. 

Last thing I will leave you with is this: Most of my best investments (I've been in the game since 2007) are bets that initially lose money but, over time (investing), they yield fantastic rewards. 

Build a portfolio around quality. What phone do you use, what web browser do you use? What do you use to shop? What stores do you go to? (I'm not interest in knowing but these are the questions I ask myself as, more likely than not, there are others out there using the same phone, browser, shopping app's, etc..) that's where I would start.

2021-05-06 13:38:37,stocks,"Rule of thumb: If anyone comes to you ever about a ""get rich quick"" scheme - don't do it.

There are billions of people and trillions of dollars all dedicating all of their time and energy to learning about, researching and timing the market. It doesn't mean you can't do well but it does mean you need to be smart. While I think everyone should invest in the market long term - yolo-ing your savings into a bunch of highly volatile overcrowded tech stocks isn't sound financial advice.   


**Reassess. Take a step back.** What are your goals? What is a realistic valuation for a company? What products do you believe in? What is your risk tolerance? Create rules for yourself about when to invest and when to cut your losses. Do you research. Look for contra opinions. High short interest? Ask yourself why - there could be a legit reason. Stop reading people's sensational reddit posts about stocks - otherwise you might as well play the lottery.

2021-05-06 13:47:28,stocks,Also in 2020 you could guess on all your companies and made a good return. This is where the real investing begins.
2021-05-06 13:50:52,stocks,"Here's my advice: 

Before you buy any stock make sure you open the companies 10-k(annual report). You can look this up on the SEC's EDGAR website : [https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html)

 Type in a companies stock ticker and grab the 10-k to look at their annual performance, you can also look at 10-q's if you want to check on their quarterly results. Try to stick mostly to businesses your familiar with, it'll be a lot easier to analyze a company. In the 10-k table of contents - click on financial statements. 

Look at the financials, decreasing revenue year over year and ballooning debt? Stay away! Growing revenue, but Cost of Goods Sold/ Cost of Sales increasing out of control? Ask yourself why? Is there a good reason?

Do a simple analysis of the balance sheet, it takes two minutes. Do assets exceed liabilities? If no, there better be good reason such as the business being new. Is the company recording a net profit? If they are a large established company and they are not, you probably want to stay away unless there is a very good reason or a turn around plan in place you think will work. Make sure to check out the competitors financials as well. You don't want to invest in a company and later find out they are up against a much large, better funded competitor that has superior margins and a far healthier balance sheet. 

After all this research consider where you think the business will be in ten years and if you feel comfortable investing. Only after that should you invest. Know where you are putting your money! Otherwise, it's not investing it's just sophisticated gambling. This is a high level approach, there is a ton more research you can do when evaluating investments. 

Now that we got that out of the way. Your investments in SPY/VOO are fine. These are indexes tracking the largest 500 companies in the market. The fundamental purpose of the stock market is for individuals to provide capital to companies so that they can grow their business. If businesses were failing to grow their operations, no one would would invest in the stock market. The market has historically grown an average of 10% per year over the last century, so you can keep those ETF's and even buy more periodically. However, it should be noted they are both S&P 500 ETFs holding the same stocks. Just a not in case you want to diversify a bit.

Now, with all that said; Analyze the tech companies  you already bought into. Open the 10-K's and look at the competitors, where do you see the businesses in 10 years? After that consider whether you want to hold or not. Look at some other companies. I usually give the advice to hold, but that's mostly to stop people from panic selling and missing a recovery of their losses. Sometimes it makes sense to sell, why hold onto $300 of garbage when you can get your $300 cash and invest in a really good business that you believe in and will provide a better return? 

At the end of the day you want to be confident in your investment, if there is a crash and you lose 50% or your value you want to be confident that you'll make your money back and more. Doing your due diligence is what will provide you that confidence. Only after doing the research will you know what to do. Get out there and good luck."
2021-05-06 13:51:15,stocks,"‚ÄúIf you wouldn‚Äôt own the company for ten years don‚Äôt even think about owning it for ten minutes‚Äù

Use tips instead of normal bonds due to the inflationary environment, and that has been keeping my 2020 Tendies safe from 50% losses. 

This only helps you now, the way you prosper long term is learning. Learn how to make money when the market moves. No one can say much with certainty about the market ie where it‚Äôll go and when, but you can guarantee the market will slosh from one financial asset to another. Right now tech got flooded and then that flood went into cyclicals. I was diversified enough that I didn‚Äôt loose much on my tech growth stocks. Personally I need to understand interest rates and probably many other things to get better. 

Investing isn‚Äôt 2020 easy all the time, but operating from systems made by very smart people and understanding as much of the market as you can is what could allow you to make money year after year.

The reality is that you are an investor newbie getting scared because you have the false mindset that stocks truly do only go up. You need to calm down, realize that dips in the market are normal, and you need to do research on the stocks you own. If you bought a bunch of MEME stocks and they were down, well you learned a hard lesson on FOMO and why you need to know timing and/or limits.

But, based on some of the posts of what you own, you need to learn to take a breather and even step away. One of the easiest ways to lose money in the stock market is get scared by dips and bail when the price drops on stocks that aren't ones to be worried about.

2021-05-06 15:17:21,stocks,"Trying to make money in days or months is timing the market.  It‚Äôs literally gambling.  There is no guaranteed way to win this.  As many people end up wiped out as winning big. Long term, this mentality makes less than slow and steady investment, even for winners.

You make money by buying low and selling high.  The market is high, so you won‚Äôt realize gains unless you gamble lucky, or wait until recovery from the market correction that will happen once the CA -> TX housing exodus finishes in a year or two.

Buying one or three stocks is gambling.  You need to hedge your bets.  I like funds better.  ETF or mutual.  It lets you buy lots of stocks with less money, and professional managers work to keep value and objectives.

Dollar cost averaging is a cool term.  You buy in regularly, so as things dip, you buy cheaper, and as things grow, you gain.  You might think it nets zero, but over time, it grows.  Doubling every ~10 years is normal.

For ‚Äúto the moon‚Äù kind of investing, that is gambling, and discussed in /r/WallStreetBets .  Plenty of horriffic losses and insane gains. Never bet what you cannot lose.

Really though, the ride is years, not months.  Anything ‚Äúfaster‚Äù will get hit really hard with fluctuations."

2021-05-06 15:20:46,stocks,"Self opinion and not professional investment advice.

To my limited experience stocks can make a comeback unless the business is completely defunct and/or the industry is not profiting.

For example I started investing in 2008 right before it crashed or was it 2006? I held on and my Cisco that had lost half it's value ended up growing to over 50 percent of what I bought it at (this took years mind you).

DSX on the other hand I bought around $10-15 and it's still worth next to nothing. Sold that only to buy into it again this year and go from $2 to less than that.

It helps when you only put in money you can afford to lose and/or when you put in $1 and it goes to $10 you sell $1 to recoup your principle and then you can worry less."

That said, everyone is a genious in an extremely bullish market, and after the massive bear of March 2020, the economy was almost all bulls.  Now we're seemingly at a peak for the moment and people are risk averse as the fed has been unclear about whether or not they're going to raise interest rates.  You're bought into the market already, so it's gonna be some good lessons now!  

How do you ride it out?  Well, for one, you only lose the money when you sell.  If your stock is down, it'll get better, it'll linger as a zombie company, or the company goes bankrupt and you lose.  If you've invested smartly in solid companies with good long term fundamentals, then you're probably going to be fine: as soon as the market shakes off skittishness it will continue to climb and the downturn is actually an opportunity to push a little more money and get more shares on sale!  Just don't get all your advice from wallstreetbets and buy a bunch of meme stocks from dubious companies in online pump and dump attempts.  Also, invest what you can afford to not see again for awhile.

If they are flaky companies that were overvalued on hype, you might wanna get rid of them while you still have some money left. You can definitely make money on short term ""hot stock"" buys but it's very risky and you need to be prepared to get out fast. You were smart to put some money into ""safer"" things like SPY, but keep in mind nothing is ever completely safe especially in terms of a 1-3 year window.

2021-05-06 13:37:22,stocks,"To give a relevant example:

I own ALGN and MRNA. 

ALGN is long-term a great company, they sell invisalign, universally loved, at a high price point. huge social media presence and big competitive moat around them. I take any dips as opportunities to own them. 

MRNA I'm up about 38% but with all the uncertainty around Biden's plans to make the patents free, I don't know if I still hold that stock from here, so i sold all of it today. 

Look for great companies and long term investments."

whatever DD or insight you think you have is all info that just helps you sleep at night.

The way to do it in all market conditions is risk management.

If you take the approach that you can lose 30-50% over a 6-18 month time frame, itll help you in ticker selection and position size.

People who tell you ""invest for the long term"" are often examples of people who are ignoring the risk present and have trader bias. They also tend not to realize the real underlying reasons why stocks tend to move up and down.

Is betting on a large US tech stock with a massive consumer base a decent bet? absolutely. Can this company lose 30-50% of its value at any time? absolutely.

Just because you think a company will be around 3-5 years, does not mean people will value it the same way as you do. 

A company with shit earnings can rally hard and maintain growth as long as the majority of the market buys into it."

Personally, I recently bought back into Tesla at what seems like a recent high‚Ä¶ I used to own it and sold it back around $100 after the first few spontaneous fires. 

That was foolish and emotional. I sold it AFTER rejecting a shitty trade deal in fantasy football. That should‚Äôve been my first red flag. 

I also bought more Apple a few weeks ago. Also trending down. 

I bring these both up because they‚Äôre both trading lower BUT I still believe in these companies and if I had more money I would buy the dips. 

If you can afford to stay in, maybe you hold and weather the storm. In other news I also purchased Mankind and held thinking it would turn around. I‚Äôm still at a -91.92% on that baby.

I like the stock. I like the company. The initial draw is you believe the companies stock will rise quick but then realize that‚Äôs not always the case or like you said it may take some years. It will happen. So then having limited resources to invest it makes you actually have to consider where you want to put that money. Anyway it‚Äôs all kinda zen and empowering in an unexpected way.

GME also got me into investing, but one of the first lessons I learned was to not go all in on meme-stocks (or anything for that matter).

Sure, the bulk of my holdings is GME, but I'm also diversifying into slower but surer growth stocks with mostly reliable companies as well.

If I were to ignore how wildly my GME holdings affects my overall portfolio, I would actually be securely (as far as that word goes in the stock market) up about 5-ish% in just the last month, which, yeah, I'm not rich and I'm not retiring early or anything, but that's also not too bad considering that I'm still an amateur at this."

Just saying that if you buy stocks without knowing anything about them it's a bit hard to make a good decision or feel confident in the company, unfortunately after you buy it's a lot harder to make the decision as emotions will cloud your judgement.

Given what you owned before try researching Square, Paypal, Coinbase, and Riot.

Now on to your current positions, I will try and give you my DD on them short and long term.

**Short term** *aka wth happened to them*
In Q1 of this year the market rotated from tech/growth (your stuff) to re-opening stocks. Don‚Äôt panic, you‚Äôre in good stuff, you just timed your entry badly. Patience will very likely solve this mistake on its own, if you believe in those holdings now could be a good opportunity to add to them. (But learn more first as I said above) do not panic and switch to re-opening stuff, ‚Äúchasing the trade‚Äù rarely works.

**Long term** *will this be forever?*
I hold two of the five tickers you mentioned and I plan to have them for years. The market will rotate back into tech / growth it just needs to cool down a bit because it was overbought during the pandemic. How do I know investors will come back to the tech sector (and specifically the stuff ARKK holds?)

What else are they gonna do? **not** invest in the future???

I‚Äôm also a highly contrarian investor so Wallstreet‚Äôs jealousy of Cathy Wood‚Äôs gains and criticism of her methods makes me more interested in her fund not less. Try reading some of ARKK‚Äôs investor communications you can learn a lot from them.

**final thought** if none of the tickers I suggested make your heart soar and your mind sing, then consider the three following options while you continue learning.

1. Hold cash (yes I know inflation is scary but it doesn‚Äôt happen overnight)

2. Dollar cost average into an index fund for the next year+ until you find something more appealing

3. Continue doing what you were doing before"

2021-05-06 11:22:40,stocks,"Stocks are not a get rich quick scheme.

Stop watching them.  Wait.  They will grow.

Also, never invest money you can't afford to lose.

Finally, if you really need to make yourself feel better, go look at the 5-10 year chart.  I'm guessing for all of your stocks you'll see that they're going up.  Then notice there's tons of little drops in there.  You're just in one of those little drops.

Also, you need to consider why you're investing.  If you're investing to make quick money, then you may as well get out of the market because you're just going to lose money that way.

Edit; Also, you haven't lost anything.  You still have exactly the same number of stocks you bought.  If you buy a new car, the instant you drive it off the lot it depreciates at least 20% in value.  Do you lament how you just lost 20% of the money you spent to buy the car, or are you ok with that because you still have the car?"

2021-05-06 11:39:21,stocks,Just a noob myself but NFLX should be a pretty solid investment I would have thought. I'd be inclined to buy the dip and average down.

2021-05-06 12:08:03,stocks,"Don‚Äôt sweat it. All 4 of those companies have good fundamentals but are overvalued with many future growth already priced in. If you can hold them for 5-10 years, you will likely be better than okay. You could buy some on the dip to average it down. However, I think the best thing for you now is to educate yourself on how the stock market works. Good luck."

I took a small hit on pton myself but once I saw that initial report I set a higher stop loss and  was out the next day. Your other investments are shaky atm, but it's earnings season and the market is schizophrenic right now. You bought high during a self sell off, congrats, we've all done it including Peter fucking Lynch. Learn from it if you think it's worth it, but my advice is set stops on your iffy stocks and let the others ride."
2021-05-06 13:02:38,stocks,Nvidia a strong buy
2021-05-06 15:24:06,stocks,"Some of the biggest ‚Äúwinners‚Äù in the stock market are those that are no longer with us. Time in the market beats timing the market. Don‚Äôt worry because your investments have gone down in the past two/three months. Give it a year or two and re-assess your portfolio. 

And for the love of god invest in ETFs, they will keep you sane when one of your major investments takes a hit."

2021-05-06 16:29:36,stocks,How much did you invest? Depending on the amount you learned the lesson of diversification for probably a relatively inexpensive tuition.
2021-05-06 16:34:08,stocks,"You're not really listening to the majority of the comments here it seems.

You are basing your judgements on literally 2 months worth of activity/news.

All those companies are within a macroeconomic environment and tech revolution that is *only* going to benefit them in the *long run*. 

The stock, the company, the prospects of said company have not really changed. The only thing that has changed is the price. 

So, it's either seen as a discount at which you'd buy more at, or it's a price you're not willing to sell at. 

If you need the money in the short term then long term investing doesn't make sense for you- literally by definition"

It‚Äôs not easy seeing money that you‚Äôve invested lose value, sometimes a lot of value, over the course of a few days/weeks or even months. Seasoned investors are used to this. They‚Äôve probably been in the game so long that it wouldn‚Äôt register as a loss for them unless the share price completely tanked. 

Newbie investors that have started to invest in decent companies are seeing some short term downturns in their stocks and panicking. Now it seems like so many people are talking about massive ‚Äúcorrections‚Äù in the market. Just stay steady and you‚Äôll be fine. If you‚Äôre really into stocks for the long term you can just not look at the market for a few weeks/months."
2021-05-06 12:15:32,stocks,"Yep.  Investing in overhyped, overpriced stocks seems like a loosing battle.  SPY (or VTI, VIOO, etc) are great ways to invest for the long term.  

&#x200B;

I saw an interesting video comparing ARKK to 2x QQQ.  They had similar risk and trajectory, but 2x QQQ didn't take a shit, and it's a known entity made of well known and profitable companies.  If you want more risk, ARKK doesn't seem to be the best way to do it."

2021-05-06 08:56:52,stocks,"SPY and VOO are great, but they aren't stocks - they are funds, which means that their ups and downs are decided by the price of the stocks they are holding and not how many people are willing to buy SPY or VOO. I would focus on index funds (like VOO) for investing rather than individual stocks for now, especially if you don't know much about the market. An index fund basically follows the market movement and long-term is a fairly safe bet."

2021-05-06 17:33:33,stocks,"I think you need to fundamentally reevaluate how you look at stocks. When you buy a stock youre buying a business. When you buy spy and voo you're buying part of the american economy. 

Listen to peter lynch or warren buffet talk about how to evaluate. Dont worry about what stocks they chose,  what sectors, or what specific valuations they used to determine. That was a different time. But the way they look at stocks and handle stock market mentality is timeless. 

If its too much for you, just put a bi-weekly auto pay to buy more spy or voo and spend your time making more money or being happy. Putting a lot of time into the market isnt for everyone, when you can just go index fund and will probably outperform most of the people who are just getting in because they wont take it seriously enough. Set an automatic payment, and forget it. Dont even look at it."
2021-05-06 18:32:05,stocks,"I‚Äôm up about 30% since ~2018. When I started, I had small money, so investing $1000 and losing $100 was a huge bummer. 

I invested through vanguard. Their archaic platform makes it difficult to watch my investments. The first year I invested my returns were flat or negative. They went up a small amount and then March 2020 came and I was negative again. 

My point is that, almost every month except for March 2020, I was investing at ATH. BUT these investments are for retirement. It takes a long time to get started, but as the market ages, we get higher and higher hold points, and every low is a new opportunity for you to buy. 

Tldr; stop cherry picking stocks. Stop buying meme stocks (ahem, ARKK). Just auto buy the index once a month and ignore it"

2021-05-06 19:50:51,stocks,"My 14 year-old daughter started a Starbucks habit,  buying those sugary smoothy drinks.  For her b-day I bought her $1k of Starbucks stocks in Nov. (and framed a fake certificate) and told her I'll buy her drinks using the unrealized gains (out of my pocket, not actually selling).  It has averaged about $30 a month so far, which is a couple orders per week.  She gets the $1k when she turns 18 (or the equivalent amount of stock if I can figure out how to transfer) and I'll take the gains I'm buying coffee with.  So far I think it has been an excellent lesson on why saving money early pays off big later.  I keep telling her to save her allowance, so she can invest in Apple when she's 18 and pay for all of her phone upgrades with the gains.  I actually think she's starting to get it."

Like you might love any number of companies if they give their products away free, but that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs a business you want to own. I hate paying my utility bill but that doesn‚Äôt mean it wouldn‚Äôt be a good company to invest in. I say that at the very least liking a company is pretty low on the list of reasons to own it.

2021-05-06 18:37:38,stocks,"Not just that, you become emotionally attached to your investment. Preventing you from making decisions without emotions.

2021-05-06 15:31:59,stocks,"I mean you still have to use common sense when you‚Äôre doing this. I‚Äôve only had good experiences with Uber but anyone that reads just a little bit of news knows what‚Äôs going on with them right now. Never jump in completely blind. Im just saying, especially for beginners, you don‚Äôt have to do a ton of confusing research to make some good long term investments."
2021-05-06 15:12:51,stocks,Uber is a terrible company that doesn‚Äôt want to pay their workers or give them benefits. For that reason I would never me touch them anyway. They need to be regulated
2021-05-06 15:58:15,stocks,"Uber is certainly one of the more risky investments I can think of right now. On one hand, if they prevail, they're posting the smallest losses ever through a pandemic ridden quarter and the economy is rapidly recovering. They could do phenomenally well and are well positioned for a majority across the entire market in the foreseeable future. But if these regulations pass, Uber likely won't survive.

I was very excited to be invested in Uber and I had calculated my risk tolerance and my portfolio together, but I had to cut it after finding out I've got some medical bills coming up. I've got some substantial returns in most of my other investments, but I'm probably going to have to liquidate most of it soon and so I'm thinking more on the short term than usual. Risky investments often depend on variables that are totally unknown, and the regulation status on Uber/Lyft is one of those unknowns that can dramatically swing the stock one way or another.

And I hate it, but until we have a clearer picture on this regulation, it's tough to make a call. I'd otherwise feel more confident about this particular stock. 

Edit: For clarity"
2021-05-06 13:12:01,stocks,"At first, maybe. I think it's only bad advice if it's the sole reason for buying all the stocks in  your portfolio.

If *you* like a company, it doesn't seem farfetched that other people like this company as well. That means the customers are loyal and bring in a somewhat constant revenue stream. If it's a household name, there's a good chance it's profitable, too. Imo the financials should be at least checked to be a bit safer. 

Investing in companies like Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Coca Cola, etc. is in hindsight not the worst strategy there is. Of course there are probably more profitable options out there, but that's a totally different point."
2021-05-06 13:52:19,stocks,Short term fluctuations of -50% are a bit tough to swallow though...

2021-05-06 11:40:19,stocks,But also don‚Äôt just walk away and look then come back in two years! Monitoring your investments is important and so is finding a balance for how much you do that. Understanding how many different stocks to own also factors into this. For me I like to buy stock in things I use and care about so I‚Äôm motivated to follow the news about those companies.
2021-05-06 11:38:04,stocks,I think his point is that investing in company stocks alone is bad risk management? In the Netherlands on a professional level think 500k+ portfolios. They only invest into funds and absolutely avoid individual stocks. Perhaps my country is extremely conservative though since American hedge funds buy individual stocks.
2021-05-06 11:36:26,stocks,"you said, think years into the future.

If you really have that itch to manage your picks, only allow yourself to have 10% of your total portfolio value in speculative plays. 

Discipline is key, and it‚Äôs hard sometimes. Sometimes I catch myself wanting to buy heavy into something that will produce great gains in the short term. Sometimes I don‚Äôt catch myself, and things like this March happen and I end up regretting it and bag holding. Stay disciplined and good luck."

2021-05-06 15:03:03,stocks,"right, that boils down to ""if what you like is the same as what make a company sustainably successful, buy what you like"" which can be abbreviated to ""buy companies that should remain sustainably successful"""
2021-05-06 14:03:50,stocks,"I completely agree.  But still the above advise holds.  If it's a good company that you believe in, then just hodl it until the big money decides to come back to tech.

2021-05-06 14:19:54,stocks,I love how you get downvoted for stating what the empirical evidence shows. This sub will lose so much money when there is an actual prolonged bear market.
2021-05-06 11:48:13,stocks,Why did you have the stop losses then?
2021-05-06 18:03:06,stocks,"Still annoyed us Europeans can‚Äôt buy ARK...oh well, SPY, QQQ, IWM and individual stocks it is."
2021-05-06 16:08:24,stocks,"Surely holding today‚Äôs giants alongside Ark innovation is a hedge against bagholding the FAANG.

2021-05-06 11:03:01,stocks,Put more money in and cost your average down. Once th markets perform better in the long run you'll be laughing in  few years. Forget about that money.

I did a lot of research, but without any experience with the market, it wasn't particularly useful.  How can you know what to trust if you have no experience digging through the massive pile of information (and misinformation)?  Now I'm bagholding a portfolio that's down like 25% in 2 months."

2021-05-06 19:17:26,stocks,I think Robinhood is good for a new investor without tens or hundreds of thousands to invest to learn how it works due to how good the interface is. Once you learn what a lot of the stuff is you can transition to a more reputable broker and not be swamped trying to figure what everything is on their shitty UI.

2021-05-06 13:36:11,stocks,"thats true but man I have enough gains in the last year to cover like 10 flat years. That being said I did sell all my tsla, so much is priced in. for it to go up more I think not only would FSD have to come out but regulators would have to agree and after that we can gauge the profitability. That will take years and years."
2021-05-06 12:58:18,stocks,"My first investing book ever stated 97% don't outperform the market. I think this figure may have been for fund managers, so not even your average retail joe. Meaning only 3% of fund managers can actually reliably beat the market."
2021-05-06 17:35:15,stocks,"Hey old-timer in my 30s who was investing back during the 08 crisis here:

A lot of guys and gals are thinking about this the wrong way, because they got lured into the market seeing pro traders making daily gains and showing off their best moments (during a crazy market, as you recognize). Unless you're a professional day trader, you should not be relying on stocks for day-to-day income....and sadly the last couple years may have been the best chance to do that for another 20 or 30 lol...I hope I'm wrong.

Try looking at your investments as a long game, and you will be more successful and less stressed. Buy stuff that you can hold for a couple years or decades, and then it's not about ""oh god oh god if this doesn't go up I won't make money today"" and if you happen to see one of them pop, great! It's fun and good to take some risks on short plays now and then, but as far as the bulk of your portfolio ought to be concerned, you are just trying to time your exit at some point between now and at some point when you need it in retirement. Dividends aren't as glamorous as options, but that's the reality of how most people retire comfortably.

Even if we see months or years of losses during a recession....that shit will go back up before you're 60 my friend, and that's what really matters. Whether or not you're up or down, it's about what the scoreboard says at the end, whenever that may be."
2021-05-06 18:31:38,stocks,"No shit. There are a ton of great companies out there that fit that description though.

We‚Äôve seen cycles like this before, I find it hilarious that so many people act as if this is the first time we‚Äôve seen these things happen.

So many of these companies that are getting trashed on the past few months are going to be absolute giants 10 years from now. And so many retail investors will miss out on those runs from selling too early due to all this fear the big boys are driving in the market. Far too many scared inexperienced retail investors are falling for it all hook, line and sinker."
2021-05-06 19:05:48,stocks,My wife tells me every other day how her IRA investments are all doing well except for those goddamn green energy ETFs I encouraged her to pick. Dunno how long I can keep saying ‚Äújust wait it out they‚Äôll be back up‚Äù üòÖ

2021-05-06 10:37:50,stocks,Lmao.  Rkt emoji?
2021-05-06 16:06:51,stocks,"Look up right to repair. [Veritasium](https://youtu.be/j5v8D-alAKE) has an interesting video comparing Apple to old electric companies that conspired to make the lightbulb shittier (they were getting too good, so people weren't buying as many).

I love my MacBook, but Apple is definitely anti-consumer. They sort of have to be, since everyone can afford a phone, all phones are pretty much the same, they could in theory last a long time, so they need to pull the same tricks that electric companies and car companies pulled in the past.

As a result, they make a lot more money."
2021-05-06 15:20:37,stocks,"my reasons for having gripes with apple are irrelevant to the discussion - the relevant facts are:

* apple pisses me off
* but in a way that is responsible for them raking in ludicrous profits
* therefore the rule ""invest only in companies you like"" is violated in this case"
2021-05-06 18:50:08,stocks,"I think you forgot, we‚Äôre on Reddit, and Reddit has a seething hatred for Apple. I work in IT, and let me tell you: my company‚Äôs Apple devices are nearly problem free (iPhones and iPads with a few Macs), while Windows/Android devices have more problems on average. I have also used an all-Apple setup personally for the last 6-7 years and I have had nothing but positive experiences. Windows and Android are great in their own ways, but speaking as someone who deals with many operating systems and pieces of software every day, Apple takes the cake for reliability, consistency, simplicity, and ease of use 10 times out of 10. You might pay more, but these devices last for years longer than their cheaper Windows/Android counterparts."
2021-05-06 15:57:04,stocks,"Examples from my experience:
1) IPhone 5s slips out of pocket and lands on the corner, broken display because of exposed glass. This was on day 3 of usage, the protective case i bought was being in mail at the moment. Why is it not part of standard packaging?
2) same time I had also a Samsung s5, comparable phone, but Samsung was _waterproof_ (IP67). Apple did that on... the iPhone X (?)
3) from s5 i went to s9 (4+ years full use) wearing through 3 batteries. Yes batteries weren't cool back then. I needed no tools to replace the battery.
4) I tried playing an mp3 clip a friend sent me via e-mail (he produced it) on the iPhone... why did I need an iTunes account and why did I need to upload it there first? Why this closed ecosystem?
-> took out my android s5 from the other pocket and 4 clicks later heard the clip.

Don't think I am only contra Apple, (battery management and 80% of user experience is equal or better there) but for a phone with 2x...3x the price I expect better performance in everyday life."
2021-05-06 15:27:03,stocks,"Didn't they get sued/fined for installing bloatware on their phones when a new version came out to slow/hinder its performance?

Personally, I believe in the Apple-esque, cult-like mentality of their customer base. I honestly think now that people have created their home gyms, public gyms will be more in trouble post-pandemic as customers are reluctant to deal with gym rats and sweaty shared equipment. And if not, I think Peloton has a big opportunity to put their bikes in every gym, hotel, etc, so that people can take their rides wherever they go. We‚Äôll see, I guess.

2021-05-06 16:23:24,stocks,Maybe the nickel and diming refers to changing the charge port every other phone so you can't use any of your old cords with new product so any additional cords would have to be bought again?
2021-05-06 17:58:32,stocks,"Yeah. They would be nickel and diming. And its annoying to someone whos not in apple ecosystem. And cost of doing business to use all your other apple stuff if you are in the ecosystem. 

Apple and samsung have both been nickel and diming for years. No headphone jack, not universal chargers, changing the chargers that are used. I dont like apple products that much myself, but soo many do. And so many will only buy other apple products because they work well together and people have liked iphone for a long time by now.

If you have been holding long it doesn't matter but buying ETSY or PINS in Feb 2021 could be a drag on your portfolio for a long time. That's not FUD it's just a potential reality. It may not but if tech corrects ETSY sure is correcting hard. It was up close to 400% since 2020.

You realize that the average life on the S&P500 is around 18 years right? If Lehman, BlackBerry, Enron can drop +80% and be delisted so can pintrest.

You're right, Valient turned out to be super sketchy but at one time it had the highest valuation on the TSX."

Oh that‚Äôs so annoying they seemed fine in how they communicated it based on what I herd (some earnings calls / interviews) sounds like such a cry baby suit, I honestly feel like participants in these types of  lawsuits should be barred from purchasing the respective security in perpetuity.

2021-05-06 06:17:04,stocks,Transfer fee deducted
2021-05-06 06:50:39,stocks,"My broker charges a basic fee for ""delivering"" the paid dividend to my account. They also have other kinds of accounts where this is not the case but you are limited to stock trading with such an account. You might want to check your contract and see if they charge any fees with your type of account."

I am surprised your brokerage account does not have a line item for the full dividend amount , and a separate line item for the with holding.  I am not an accountant, but that is my guess"
2021-05-06 18:37:33,stocks,"There is a fee associated with dividend payments, which is quite small and spread across all holders of that stock. I'll post back with the full details as I don't have it at hand."

2021-05-06 13:55:53,stocks,"So I'm in the same boat with a lot of my American stocks. Minus transfer and conversion fees I loose a chunk as well. It took me a while but I determined since I trade out of a tax free account, the bank automatically deducts what would be the tax (income earned per dividend) per trade. Perhaps this is whats happening to you as well?"

2021-05-06 09:20:52,stocks,"Definitely.  Any foreign investment I've ever received a dividend for has different line items for everything.  There's usually line items for the dividend, a foreign tax fee and a management fee.

I'm not sure why they would wrap the fees into the dividend amount."

2021-05-06 00:00:00,stocks,"Green investing: is it worth it? I was wondering what do you guys think about stock listed  companies using market forces and being more and more involved in the sustainable/green industry? I recently saw a Dutch company doing exactly this and I wanted to share this one with you guys as an example and as food for discussion about the industry in general. 
It's called Dutch Green Business (DGB). This is probably the first time you're hearing about this company, so let me first tell a bit more about it. Dutch Green Business (AMS:DGB) is a Dutch company that I've been eyeing for a while. It's a stock listed at the Amsterdam Exchange Euronext. It was a shell stock until recently, when a new CEO picked up and started a green business model. It's business model revolves around reforesting crucial areas around the world and selling the carbon credits it obtains from this. Despite being rather small it has been hogging the limelight quite a bit recently. Not too long ago former British politician Nigel Farage (!) joined the Advisory Board of DGB. DGB's first projects in Paraguay and Sierra Leone are also picking up steam. This acquisition is only the latest bit of news and it seems to confirm DGB's commitment to utilizing market forces to offset carbon emissions. Personally I am quite into green investing and this stock recently popped by when doing my research, let me know what you think!"
2021-05-06 09:37:00,stocks,"Judging by my clean energy ETFs.... no. No it‚Äôs not.

2021-05-06 10:41:52,stocks,"I'm down like 25% in ICLN, but it's a long term hold for me so I don't mind so much (or at least that's what I tell myself so I can sleep at night). Long term I don't see how it could be a bad investment."
2021-05-06 09:39:35,stocks,Thanks for insulting my research like that
2021-05-06 07:47:29,stocks,"Understandable. But you should take a look at the bigger picture. Namely that having such an influential person on board does open doors for a  company like DGB. And I'm aware of the controversies that exist around reforestation, but I do think that DGB is an exception. It offers an exceptionally high level of transparency."
2021-05-06 11:21:09,stocks,"You‚Äôre 100% correct. It‚Äôs a given in my opinion that the clean energy trend will definitely be profitable longterm. By then it won‚Äôt even be a ‚Äúclean energy trend‚Äù it will just be our energy sector in general as we have gotten used to the idea of clean operations with little to no carbon. But as of right now? Lol not worth it, yet."

Do they honestly expect taco bell and popeyes to have better future potential than apple or even nio?

It could be a good time to buy the dip. Fair warning though and I'm a trucker so I know the industry, they don't have the best reputation and they have been struggling for a while now. Their stock could very well go down to the $2-$4 range again who knows. Freight is booming right now though and every other LTL company is doing great, it's just Yellow that did bad.

It's a risky call and I'm thinking the stock might keep going down. But who knows. 

I'm thinking of buying little by little and seeing where the price trends start going. With such a huge drop though there could be good opportunity to make some money down the line if the stock can rebound. But it's a risky call for sure. Just because the LTL industry is booming doesn't mean that the Yellow stock will rebound and go back up."

I'd connect the dots here (since it seems like growth tech might want to give up all of its pandemic gains)."
2021-05-06 13:13:08,stocks,There is a reason 95% of all millionaires own stocks. If you need piece of mind Invest in something super safe like $voo or $vti and don't look at it for 5 years.
2021-05-06 13:24:17,stocks,"Hey, it sounds like you've invested a lot in yourself so don't beat yourself up too much for getting a bad beat in the stock market.

I'd carefully examine the criteria you use when picking companies or other securities to invest in and develop a mindset that includes both qualitative and quantitative analysis. It's fine to identify companies with promising tech, intriguing patents, etc., but none of that matters if you pay a premium for it like a lot of people have lately.

I'd pay more attention to financial statements to see which companies have steady growth, good cash flow, etc. Is a company taking on more debt to fund its growth? Are they issuing more shares? The latter is a common practice that will dilute your holdings and depreciate their value. Just an example of things to look for.

EDIT: added some info I thought might be helpful getting you on the right track."
2021-05-06 10:09:13,stocks,for those that had money in 2020.. through a pandemic lol

I like DKNG on the merit that gambling is a growing industry, but their net cash flow is ultra-negative and trending WORSE despite its growth. Plus, they're issuing more shares to fund their growth."
2021-05-06 10:21:25,stocks,I'm pretty sure leadership lowered guidance during earnings last night. A lot of companies that benefitted from the pandemic has seen their stock drop after earnings this quarter.

2021-05-06 14:19:28,stocks,"I don't think it's nonsensical.  The run-up to this point in time was pretty crazy. IMO it's normal for people to be skeptical and wanting to take some profit while they still can.

2021-05-06 19:10:17,stocks,"All I know is that my timing for everything is dick. 

I buy a dip. It keeps on dipping. I buy in anticipation of good earnings. Surprise fool, all your fav companies run up for 2 days and then fall like a rock to discount prices. I buy in the green. It dips in no time. I try to avoid buying something green and wait for it to recede. It goes green for several days in a row and I finally cave only for it to dip. Between etting tech recover a fair bit before finally buying more by the end of March into start April and buying companies to catch earnings momentum only to have it all snatched away and averaging down a falling position just to get shredded with knives has been no shortage of sheer frustration. 

I have now resolved that outside of a truly dramatic drop in one of positions over a day or 2, I'm just gonna add specific amounts to my various holds at approximate intervals if conditions seem fine outside of truly good looking opportunities. And will probably make a strict policy to not add to any positions ahead of earnings cause those seasons are just way too volatile to be worth the headache."

The problem with speculation alone is that you can't reasonably justify a price.

Heck, Nio's entire market cap is almost doubled that of Ford, yet produced literally 25x fewer cars in the past quarter.

Whoever led you to get in on a stock like NIO or XPEV is not a source I would rely on for stock info."

2021-05-06 09:02:08,stocks,"Is it \*really\* bullish though?

From an investing standpoint, consider that the reason stock valuations are so lofty is that the Fed has promised to keep easy monetary policy until the economy improves.  The market was just getting comfortable with Powell and was beginning to believe what he said.

Now, earlier this week, Janet Yellen says that rates may need to increase to keep the economy from overheating.

Today, we get hot job numbers.  It wouldn't be insane for an investor to take money off the table if they're sitting on big gains in the run-up over 2021, especially if they think that taxes now will be lower than taxes later.

Edit - That's not to say that the good claims numbers is bad or that markets won't go up because of it--it's the balance of people adjusting to the new information that will ultimately push the market one way or another."

2021-05-06 12:49:55,stocks,"Not that I truly think that this is going to happen in growth tech, but the Nasdaq/.IXIC (and NDX) lost 70%+ in the 2000-2002 story. My benchmark for riskier assets is only down 30% since mid-February right now so it can easily get even uglier.

You should never say never and keep an open mind.

But as I have said, I have a hard time buying that benchmark falling 70%, so June or July is going to be the time to begin picking through the growth rubble."

Turns out I bought at the very top and in a week I was -20% on my portfolio and to top it off, it stayed that way for a good 2 months. I ended up selling it in panic in October, only to see it rebound in November and set a new ATH by Dec. Learned everything there was to know about investing, diversification and risk management in 3 quick months -_-

The past 2 months volatility doesnt faze me one bit as a result."

2021-05-06 06:01:16,stocks,This 2020 bull run really screwed with expectations. Markets are not supposed to hit new ATH every week
2021-05-06 08:47:53,stocks,"Markets are still close to top.
If someone is down maybe buying more of those same ‚Äúcompanies you believe in‚Äù isn‚Äôt the best idea.

2020 was special because one could make lots of money by going full sheep, buying everything he heard talked up on social media. More talk there was of some stock, more visible it was, more people would buy it, more money everyone would make.

These mechanisms don‚Äôt hold forever.
Now those talked up stocks get slaughtered while the market floats around all time highs, and people who got arrogant in 2020 are confused because the strategy of buy-what-you-hear doesn‚Äôt work so well anymore.

Keep in mind, people who bought something like Tesla (just an example, there could be many more) at around 500 weren‚Äôt necessarily smarter than those who bought it around 900, probably most cases they were just luckiest."

2021-05-06 15:43:46,stocks,I don't hold her funds but I follow her trades and I am. amazed that they continue sell quality names to catch falling knife stocks. If investors start running for the exits they will be holding a lot of bags.

It sounds like you took a hit today, but realize a lot of people didn't and were actually in the green. It's just one day, and that doesn't necessarily mean you are invested in bad companies. However, I would take care to assess your holdings and make sure you're not keeping something that's been overhyped/overvalued."
2021-05-06 16:04:41,stocks,Institutions have always had more influence than retail. This shouldn't be brand new information. Anyone that doesn't want to deal with institutions and algorithms is probably better off in a passive broad index fund and then just check back in 30 years.
2021-05-06 16:03:30,stocks,what are you talking about? it's totally reasonable that papa johns pizza stock should have a P/E ratio that is 130% higher than apple! When mask mandates get lifted and the world opens up everyone is going to celebrate by staying indoors more and ordering pizza
2021-05-06 16:03:47,stocks,yeah that 1.5% IWM power hour was a little obvious I reckon...
2021-05-06 12:06:36,stocks,Why are you so bullish on palantir? Is there anything in their business model or financial statements that leads you to believe it‚Äôs currently undervalued?

2021-05-06 14:03:49,stocks,"They had a good Q1 but reduced guidance for Q2, showed a reduction of gain-on-sale margin, talked inventory constraints and higher interest rates impacting sales. All of the forward looking issues will weigh on the stock."

2021-05-06 15:57:12,stocks,"It really is hilarious how much sentiment has turned around. ARKK has gone from the genius fund to a joke. Green energy seemed unstoppable.

2021-05-06 15:28:01,stocks,"I think the S&P is due to touch the 50 day MA. The market will probably go lower this month but I'm hoping we see some shift back to growth and the Russell 2000.

2021-05-06 11:16:20,stocks,"I think it really depends on the tech stock. There are some companies who I believe will grow into their earnings faster and more sustainably and will thus experience a smaller correction (if they do). 

However, the more speculative plays that are further detached from fundamentals (ARK) might be due for a worse time...just my opinion though."

Their console sales continue to be the strongest in the industry and they currently have 2 live action movies in the works and a tv show based off very strong IPs.

2021-05-06 09:50:23,stocks,Made a quick buck before wsb turned into what it is. As soon as my grandma called me and asked if she should buy I told her nope and sold everything. It‚Äôs still so fun to keep on a watchlist and I would love to see it rocket again but to think they are sticking it to the elites and there‚Äôs a whole conspiracy and any day now it‚Äôs just going to burst is soooooooo cringe.

2021-05-06 10:25:51,stocks,"lol bro...over a 12-month period that would be 15% gains. I think your expectations are unrealistic. Plus, you're not getting murdered for owning overpriced stocks."
2021-05-06 10:19:45,stocks,At least you have gains..
2021-05-06 10:28:33,stocks,15% annualized earnings is bad now?

2021-05-06 09:58:54,stocks,stay away. trying to catching a falling knife this early on is asking for trouble. I don't think it's fairly valued anyways.

2021-05-06 12:20:56,stocks,I suggest getting off Robinhood as step one and setting up an account with a real broker. This will save you lots of frustration later on.
2021-05-06 12:26:30,stocks,What ever you put into the market expect to sit on it for a while. Don't adjust your strategy when you get fearful just make level headed financial decisions

3) don't succumb to peer pressure"
2021-05-06 10:47:11,stocks,"I can't help you, but one thing I like to remind myself about other people's recommendations is that they've already bought into their position. You bought in at $30 and have lost a lot when it went down to $23. What's his cost basis? If he got in at $15 last November, is he as upset as you are about the recent drop? Probably not."
2021-05-06 10:33:27,stocks,"PACB may still very well be a company that ""disrupts the industry"" and has some great patented technology. However, you got burned by the fact that it's drastically overpriced at the moment and the potential growth was already baked into its price (and then some).

Finding the right company is just part of the story. As an investor, the price needs to be right to get in. I would start researching methods to place value on a company and apply a margin of safety to try and mitigate risk."

2021-05-06 09:24:57,stocks,All are good options. I personally love BlackRock
2021-05-06 09:35:50,stocks,I wouldn't discount the midcap banks and credit card companies either. Also good options.

2021-05-06 10:00:18,stocks,"I don't think anyone is going to give you a great answer regarding valuation because most of the companies in her etf's don't actually operate on a profit. A lot of speculation is baked into the price, which leaves a lot of unnecessary risk imo."

2021-05-06 18:00:38,stocks,"Meh, I don't like the fact that you don't actually own the gold or have access to it.  You own a part of the company, but you don't actually own the gold itself.  I'm too lazy to figure it out right now and try to explain it properly, but [this article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/oliviergarret/2017/03/09/3-reasons-why-investors-should-avoid-gold-etfs/?sh=769df81e4dd8) was insightful.  

TL;DR the main benefit of gold is that it's completely decoupled from the financial system or monetary policy.  Unfortunately with this ETF you're very much involved in the financial system.

If you just want some easy exposure to gold then a small position in GLD might not be the worst thing in the world.  Me personally I prefer mining stocks: NEM, GOLD, etc.  The idea is that when the price of gold goes up, these businesses become extremely profitable.  There's always bullion, too."
2021-05-06 19:24:38,stocks,It represents the number of periods of that specific timeframe you want to measure.  So a daily chart with 200 time measures the moving average of the last 200 days.  20 on a 1 minute chart represents the last 20 minutes average.

2021-05-06 11:45:53,stocks,"VTI, DIS, MTCH, NVAX, MSFT, BP, NCLH, BA, VDE, BABA

Most of my losses have come from NVAX. Down +30% in a week, absolutely mental. Would have been in pretty okay shape otherwise.

I have confidence that the other stuff will recover eventually. I really want to diversify some more but I have no cash left, so just gonna have to ride it out."
2021-05-06 11:20:06,stocks,Thank you for your service
2021-05-06 19:19:49,stocks,"I definitely see where you're coming from but you're missing an important point: the fact that buying the dip means DCAing over time. Sure, it's probably never going to hit your initial entry price again, but it doesn't *need* to for you to profit.

For example, let's say your initial F entry was for 100 shares in January 2001 when the price was at $28.46. Every year thereafter you buy 100 shares in January ‚Äî not necessarily even at a local dip, just consistently every January. You keep doing this for 10 years, eventually accruing 1,000 shares at a $11.67 cost basis by 2010. In January 2011, the price jumps up to $15.65 and instead of buying more shares you decide to sell, walking away with +$3,985 (+34%) profit.

Obviously there are some disclaimers, chief among them being the fact that you never know if the stock is going to increase relative to your cost basis ‚Äî it could be that you're just investing in a slowly dying company and will **never** realize profits. But if you have conviction in a company and truly see it moving up long term, then that is a non-issue for you. Another disclaimer is that it only really works on longer time scales and as long as you invest consistently ‚Äî if you're buying a dip every other week, you may have to wait a long time and go through a lot of capital before you're in the green. The last downside to this strategy is that of opportunity cost: could you have recouped your losses quicker if that money were invested somewhere else? 

You never *really* know if this kind of strategy will pan out long term and it takes a whole lot of discipline, but it also is relatively consistent (again, as long as you aren't investing in a rapidly disappearing company) and it's low maintenance. I can understand why some people would utilize this strategy on higher-conviction growth stocks like PLTR that will likely see significant growth in the upcoming years, even if there's a certain amount of risk to it ‚Äî but there's risk to anything. But over the long term, it shouldn't really matter if you bought at the peak as long as you *keep buying*."
2021-05-06 15:02:05,stocks,"Not necessarily...my 2 highest risk growth stocks (Pinterest and Corsair) have both had strong earnings consecutively with massive growth and still got hammered....seems like anything that has growth priced into valuation at all is whats getting hammered regardless of earnings, I'm guessing due to interest rate fears and changing earnings algorithms"
2021-05-06 15:02:24,stocks,whats causing all the growth stocks to get rekt? are there any guesses on how long this will on for?
2021-05-06 10:39:59,stocks,Wait out your growth stocks and have large exposure to safe tech especially if using margin
2021-05-06 10:57:10,stocks,Apple dividend yield is higher than my damn savings account at the moment.

2021-05-06 16:03:02,stocks,"Thanks man, that‚Äôs super interesting to read. Especially people asking why everything was seemingly going up for no reason (whereas now I always see people asking why stocks are going down for no reason)"
2021-05-06 11:54:29,stocks,"Demand for big events is off the charts. Bonnaroo and Travis Scott's Astroworld festival sold out faster than I've ever seen festivals sell out. Just anecdotally observing......

I'm expecting the same for Coachella, Lollapalooza, Tomorrowland, EDC, ACL and the like.

My contacts at Live Nation have confirmed that they're seeing pent up demand. So while you're seeing companies like Netflix see the ""pull-forward"" demand effect of the pandemic, you're seeing other companies like Live Nation see a ""held-back"" demand effect of the pandemic.

Conferences are still slow, and this a drag to the events industry, but I expect conferences to start picking up by the end of summer. If SXSW and CES officially declare 2022 on, then I see the floodgates open for all sorts of professional conferences, and this will have an additional effect of stimulating the hotel industry.

College Football is another to watch as a bellwether, and I expect them at full strength for the fall season.

Why am I talking about events, conferences and concerts?

All of these indicators will give you a sense of how bullish you should be for the alcoholic beverage industry."

2021-05-06 15:50:22,stocks,The problem is that good company does not always equate to good stock. I feel the outlook is good for NET and CRSR and SQ but I'm starting to think I didn't get them at the right price...
2021-05-06 14:26:50,stocks,"**This** is the real reason.  Some of the above sparked the initial drops, but as growth stocks started falling, growth investors started switching over the crypto, which accelerated the fall of growth stocks even more, causing more growth investors to switch over (especially to some of the more purely speculative crypto like dogecoin and ethereum classic).  At some point it will reverse again, but who knows when."
2021-05-06 14:26:51,stocks,Really? What happened in the past week that justifies a random 20%+ drop aside from stellar earnings?
2021-05-06 14:25:34,stocks,"I agree, its definitely not nonsensical. Angering but not nonsensical, as it is hard to justify a company with a price to sales of 50+ when there's the prospect of rising interest rates. Regardless, these companies might be growing more quickly than ever and innovating rapidly, so I think there will be a great buying opportunity for super disruptive companies when they find a bottom"

Obviously doesn‚Äôt mean just buy anything right after a huge runup, but I‚Äôve def fallen into the trap of often dumping money into stuff because it‚Äôs ‚Äúdipping‚Äù and just catching falling knives while avoiding things that are doing well that, you know, continue to do well."
2021-05-06 18:06:57,stocks,Legit got more mad seeing +4 and +3%s on those stocks than i did seeing a fat -7% on my DKNG. I‚Äôm pretty used to the bleeding on my growth picks by now but those boomer picks were supposed to be slow and steady! Lmao

Financials lagged the market pretty hard last year, have had some consistent momentum lately, and with the whole rising rates thing looming (real or not, its certainly perceived by the market) I think it should continue to perform well."
2021-05-06 08:18:14,stocks,I believe in it long term. It‚Äôs oversold. I think it‚Äôs a good time to start phasing in a buy. I‚Äôll average down if it gets in the 30s.
2021-05-06 14:07:01,stocks,if possible buy the dips. dca down. i would give it to years end. every dip i buy a little more. speculation stocks are getting hit now. but with the growth of nio at least. eventually i could see nio out selling ford. nio has more room for growth now than ford.

2021-05-06 09:08:10,stocks,"Yellen said later that its not something she's predicting or recommending when speaking on interest-rates increases to the Wall street journal, so that messes with your theory quite a bit. Also, tax increases don't actually affect stock prices contrary to popular belief."
2021-05-06 09:10:01,stocks,"It just shows the economy is heating up and like Yellen said they may have to raise rates earlier to combat this to avoid inflation. I mean either way you look at it, the next few years aren‚Äôt good for tech/growth stocks. You either get inflationary environment which drives commodity prices up reduces their already narrow margins or pushing them further negative. Or you get increased rates to combat inflation which also hurts growth because the cheap money isn‚Äôt as cheap and it costs them more to invest in themselves."
2021-05-06 08:45:46,stocks,"There's no good reason to believe that. It could end up being a bad day, but the numbers say it shouldn't be. Alas, markets have always been irrational though so who knows, but there's no reason for it to be a ""really"" bad day."

2021-05-06 06:30:33,stocks,Yup. Everyone keeps recommending ETFs but I hear a lot of people being down there too. To me that doesn't seem as effective a remedy as cutting out the market entirely.
2021-05-06 06:04:05,stocks,"Not worrying about the stock market. Not wasting hours looking at stocks, stats and news that have no rational reaction in the market. Investing in myself and my side business. Putting my money in HISAs and GICs where savings consistently go up instead of down.

2021-05-06 15:51:39,stocks,"Probably; it's completely tied to tech growth clearly.

Sam's and BJ's are at the same level.  Sam's also has the scan and go app which is great. Unless BJ's has that, to me this definitely puts Sam's over BJ's.

Also, I knock off a few points for BJ's because my local one has no food court. Sam's and Costco does."

You'll be ok in the long run."
2021-05-06 19:35:32,stocks,"I appreciate the reply and largely agree. My comment has more to do two things. First, a lot of posts include people saying ‚Äúbuy the dip‚Äù or ‚Äútake profits‚Äù. If you only did these things, you would over time be taking money out of securities that have been successful and putting it into securities that been unsuccessful. That can end badly. 

Second, you have to do some level of due diligence before you form an opinion as to whether something is dipping, correcting, or falling. Not all stocks recover. There are opportunity costs involved with waiting. And a dollar tomorrow isn‚Äôt worth a dollar today. 

If you are going to Dollar cost average, that can be a great way to flatten the personal impact of a fluctuating market; you just have to do it regardless of which way a stock is going, not simply when it is going down."

2021-05-06 15:27:19,stocks,"I dont know why they are getting hammered, but that's part of the risk if you invest in companies that trade mostly on future value.  Could be that earnings are just too good in more stable companies to justify the speculation.  Could be interest and inflation fear.  Could be that earnings, while good, dont justify 20+ price to sales valuations.

Impossible to say when it will end.  Could gap up tomorrow and start running, or the Nasdaq could be headed under 13k again.  These wildly speculative stocks may never recover to where they are without the earnings catching up, or they could be higher again by June."

Maybe not in high growth (and in the March case it was admittedly a total adventure in the Nasdaq, it had dropped to 12333ish and -2% I believe and then jumped nearly 400 points from there in the end), but fine otherwise.

Edit: I want to be contrarian. But I am leaning more bearish and more pain to come in high growth tech. I still suspect a bounce is coming, but it is probably temporary as to be honest, the Dow and SPX refusing to die even similarly to what happened in previous months this year before their rallies suggests that a local top might finally be near in the run they've had since the late October selloff and if they do come in just slightly more than 3-5%, I don't suspect that will end well at least to start out for growth tech."

Last week I sold out of some of my lower-conviction picks and put more of that money into VTI and VXUS.  Since then it's been somewhat lackluster, and based on how the market's going this trend may continue. I'm prepared for that.

I don't think that's an indication that long-term (years) it won't be an effective strategy.  ETFs like ARKK are another story - I'm not really a fan, to be honest.  ETFs that track a diversified index seem like a pretty good bet.

Anyway, it also depends what your goals are.   If you want to beat the market, day trade, or make quick money, then yeah, it's not easy.  But long-term I feel pretty good about having my money invested this way.

2021-05-06 09:55:46,stocks,"Sorry to say it, but it‚Äôs perfectly rational.

You mentioned Apple, well I sold it shortly before earnings because based on the observed market behavior and current situation I suspected it would drop after them. It was a guess of course, no guarantee to get it right, but a rational one.

Apple tends to drop after earnings. Other stocks recently did. Apple was at the top of its recent trading range. The market is choppy and nervous, leverage at records and the strong stocks rotations suggest liquidity is getting thin, the specter of interest rates much feared, corrections are expected. Short term price is largely controlled by speculators.

Put all together, it was a reasoned decision.

Since there are 300,737,081 A shares (GOOGL) with voting rights on the market, and 45,843,112 B shares that are owned but not traded, someone going out and buying up every single A share would be unable to effect any change at the company.

2021-05-06 00:00:00,stocks,"$LAKE: undervalued, and an indirect infrastructure play? I've been looking through stock screeners to find good value investments, and one stock stood about a bit: [Lakeland Industries](lakeland.com).

In a nutshell, the company manufactures and sells protective clothing, primarily for use in industrial applications. From their profile on yahoo finance:
> It serves end users, such as integrated oil, chemical/petrochemical, automobile, steel, glass, construction, smelting, cleanroom, janitorial, pharmaceutical, and high technology electronics manufacturers, as well as scientific, medical laboratories, and the utilities industry; and federal, state, and local governmental agencies and departments.

The company has beaten earnings consensus estimates for the past 4 quarters (sometimes by pretty huge margins, e.g. more than double, triple, or even quadruple the earnings estimates), and revenues and earnings have been steadily rising for the past 4 years (with a big spike in both in 2021). Price to earnings is an impressive 6.34, and price/book is a very respectable 1.85. The stock peaked in February and just under $41, and is now trading at $27.31 (as of May 5th, 2021). The average analyst price target is $40.

I wonder if $LAKE could also benefit from potential infrastructure spending, as most of the jobs created will require some sort of protective clothing or gear. Already the stock seems undervalued, but with this potential boost, it could be primed for further growth.

I'm a very new investor, so I wanted to post my thought process to see if it seems logical to others, and to make others aware of this potentially undervalued company. Any thoughts or comments would be very welcome!

**EDIT:**

With help from the comments from others on this post and a bit more thinking, of course, $LAKE posted massive profits in 2020 because of COVID, since they provide protective equipment. The surge in need for PPE likely drove their earnings. Increased demand for protective clothing in infrastructure industries might offer some revenue, but it likely will not have nearly as large an effect as COVID and the need for PPE.

Investors have probably realized this, and given that lockdowns are winding down and vaccines are getting out there, they're thinking about the forward projected earnings per share, and not the outlier earnings of 2020. I'll hold off on $LAKE for now."

However luck will often trump ""skill and deep analysis"" in terms of return. 

A person who picks 1000 equal sized entries and has a 100% win rate at 20% return on each will return only 20% and will underperform a person who picks 1 bet and earns 50% return.

In these situations, which do you think is harder to do? which is luck?

you should also realize that deep analysis may also not produce good results since it relies on the overall market to agree with w.e sentiment you have about a ticker."

For example AU I‚Äôve literally just sold strangles and straddles bc I know gold is a commodity and there is a cap on how high/low it will go. I‚Äôve reduced my basis in the underlying over 2k dollars over the last year just doing that. A lot of my high growth plays I‚Äôm more or less initiating positions long call and covering that position with a short that covers 50% or higher of the long premium.

I‚Äôve been doing quite a bit of reading on value investing lately. My usual investment strategy is passive index investing (focusing on VWRA), plus a few growth stock picks (SE, SQ, TSLA). Generally, I‚Äôm a buy-and-hold investor.

Something about value investing spoke to me. Perhaps it‚Äôs the fundamental analysis or the patience behind it. I started looking for companies with low PE and PEG ratios, coupled with high forecasted EPS increases.

F jumped out immediately. I see that their revenue and earnings have declined in recent years, but with the EV revolution in full swing, is this a good pick?

Why I believe it‚Äôs undervalued (fundamental analysis data taken from Finviz):

1. PE of 11.76
2. Forward PE of 7.02
3. PEG of 0.24 (!)
4. EPS this year of 158%
5. EPS next year of 62%
6. EPS next 5 years of 48%

Since I am new to value investing, am I missing something here? Or, is this a good pick to buy-and-hold?"

It looks like that number is heavily skewed by 2019, when EPS was only 0.41. Compustat lists the PE for 2019 as 930 for that year.  I can't find a way to make that make sense, so I'm thinking it's a mistake.

If I take the PEs for 2013-2018, the average PE is 10.22.

You know what they say. There are lies, damn lies, and statistics."
2021-05-06 02:23:43,stocks,"Fair enough.

An important point I keep in mind is that overpaying for a great company might not get me great future returns. A company with a P/E of 765 needs to make a lot of profit rather quickly for the returns to equal a different company with P/E of 18 (all else being equal. Its a math exercise). Something to consider with high P/E companies is how risky is this business? Will it generate enough profits to warrant to the risk? How long will the market wait for these profits? If our 765 P/E company loses 50% of its share price it will still have a 334 P/E (very high). Maybe it gets halved again, who knows.

Losing money is bad. A 50% loss is easy. To make your money back you need a 100% gain. 100% gains are hard. The lesson is to manage our risk.

Look at the financial statements. Its hard at first and confusing. With practice it becomes more and more clear what's happening financially. This is where you'll start to notice problems like major debt or weak cash flow etc.

Read the 10ks. Listen to earnings calls or read transcripts. Figure out the story of the business; does it make sense what management is selling you? Sometimes they are trying to goose a share price so their options vest etc. Don't follow the herd. Stay away from WSB.

Does the business have an enduring competitive advantage? (think Facebook or a powerful brand) Big moats are good.

Remember that High margin industries with great growth attract really smart competitors. If the barriers to entry are low, or there are a lot of existing competitors (like the car business) margins will get very tight. 

Try to look at businesses you think you have an edge at understanding. I'm from an oil producing region so I like energy and commodities etc. Currently, there is a lot of hype  around EVs and autonomous driving. I don't understand computer programming or radar so its really hard for me to pick a winner in this space.

My bet is that while EVs may need less frequent maintenance, the actual cost of maintenance will be much higher. A new battery is like 10k for a Mach-e from a cursory google search, and needs changed at 100,000 miles

Right now the obvious demographic that buys EVs are upper middle class people with short commutes to work / live in cities. That demographic doesnt put tons of wear and tear on their vehicles. 

 
Expand that to blue collar work, longer commutes, worse roads, and the inability to do maintenance at home for some of this stuff, the cost will go up dramatically."
2021-05-06 10:17:54,stocks,"I totally agree with your statement.  I believe the ROI on a ""new"" Tesla Model 3 is somewhere between five and seven years now and the up-front cost of a new Tesla is far out of reach for the average consumer (and that's including the price of electricity over the time-span).  However, there are ways to get that lower by buying a Bolt or LEAF instead, but those cars are considerably less sexy than a Tesla or Mach-E.  You could also generate your own electricity, but that only increases up-front costs.

The good news is, it's not impossible to work on or maintain your own electric vehicle.  There are plenty of people out there ""hacking"" and modifying Teslas, so even maintenance costs will eventually come down for EVs.

Good discussion!"
2021-05-06 00:00:00,stocks,"How are there no posts discussing a potential *CRASH* right now? I know, I know. Every day there are comments about an imminent crash and eventually someone will be right and bask in glory. But don't things seem to be a quite a bit worse now? Interest rate is climbing higher (but still not at alarming levels). A few days ago Yellen basically said it could go a lot higher to mitigate a potential collapse. Then she said ""well maybe"".

Is there any real reason to fear yet? I only have safe long term holds, but I would be scared to lose 20% of it. Mainly my VTI holdings because I just put most of my cash there (save 6-12mos of bills). I am tempted to sell if things keep getting worse, but I just don't know. I know no one else really knows, but how is there not much talk about this at the moment? Any thoughts on this out there? Is it just another person saying it could crash or are things starting to look pretty dark??"

2021-05-05 23:20:10,stocks,"Because anyone who dares mention such ideas is immediately downvoted and ridiculed, as usually happens in late bull markets. Generally those doing the downvoting and ridiculing are inexperience investors who just learned that ""time in the market beats timing the market"" and they like repeating that because they think that it makes them sound smart. If they also learned of index investing then they feel even smarter, as if index investing could eliminate market risk."

If you're nervous then you have too much invested.  Adjust your asset allocation.

We had a 28% crash last March 2020.  Then a sell off in September 2020.  Then we just had a slight sell off in February 2021.  The stock market will ALWAYS go up or down."

Then you get people on both sides who are rehashing ""Be fearful when others are greedy, be greedy when others are fearful"".


The only time that quote has any meaning is when a crash is already happening, and even then you might still hop in too soon and nowhere near the bottom.
Any other time, as it is now you will find that there are plenty of bears and plenty of bulls, even if one or both sides don't have good reasons why it should go up or down.



If you feel a crash is coming, you prepare for it instead of talking about it.



And since you probably won't time it right, pacing yourself by not going all in is probably the right thing to do.



After all, there's one final quote I can rehash here:
""The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent."" 


Even if your move is probably the logical thing to do, it doesn't mean the market will play out like that."

2021-05-05 23:48:14,stocks,"Yeah true, as much as I know it would eventually recover, I would always still be upset for losing so much, but then again timing it is impossible. 

Could you help me determine if i have too much invested? I believe I am following advice usually seen on here and even then I am more cautious. I have about 100k invested. 50k of that is in VTI. The other 50 is in mostly long term safe plays. The only exceptions are like RKT, DKNG, NIO, and ICLN which have been fairly big losses (maybe -2k losses overall after RKT's huge decline today). I have about 60k in cash, which is much more than most would advise I think. That 60k is easily 2-3+ years of expenses for me. I currently live at home so its even more, but I may move out soon.  Do you think I should rebalance my investments?"
2021-05-05 23:52:10,stocks,"Haha thanks dude. I did actually DCA on Tuesday and put 10k into VTI. It's actually gone up since but minuscule amounts. Yea, I do consider myself a FIRE person but don't really read the subs. Spending is low as I can but socializing is really the only thing that takes money out and that's probably something I should keep going with. Otherwise, I'm trying to minimize on everything in life and have less material things and such."

2021-05-06 17:46:32,stocks,Just speculation. Not founded in anything. End of year usually sees some sell off as is. I think people will look to get out while high and that might trigger others and a slide from there. Other factors at play as well.

But hey, I failed to see it continuously breaking new ATH's during the covid crisis, so I'm probably not the best person to ask advice from. 

These ATH's do not make any logical sense to me, personally.

I'm just here buying some otm vix calls every month for when it starts making sense again.

Wether that is in 1 month or 5 years, I'll still break even and more when it does.

Though the ones actually making money at the moment are those that bought calls continuously during the runup, I'm sure a lot of those folks will be blindsided when the music stops.

I don't see tech going higher right now, but I have AAPL and MSFT and am not selling.  I also have AMZN and GOOGL.

I recently added a little in Odfl.  They've had a 30% yoy return since 2000.

Staying diligent and buying lots of shares through early 2020 has saved me. I felt like I missed out on lots of hyper growth opportunities by doing this (GME, TSLA, you name it, I missed out) but it turns out all the other hype I bought into throughout 2020 and 2021 has pretty much evaporated to break even.

2021-05-06 00:00:00,stocks,"STAG Industrial could be acquired/merged soon? STAG is one of the best Industrial REITs in the US and although it‚Äôs a bit bigger than MNR in terms of Market Cap, it‚Äôs been trading at a significant discount when we look at its Price/FFO of 18.3x (15.8x 5y avg) against the sector (28x). STAG (and MNR as well) grows its dividend very slowly unlike other players in the sector and that might be one of the reasons for a lower Price/FFO.

STAG‚Äôs FFO growth is pretty impressive (FFO/Share not as much), debt to assets ratio is conservative at 38.9%, payout at 75.9%.

The merger news between EQC and MNR could signal that maybe STAG Industrial will be part of a similar transaction in the near future? What do you think there‚Äôs a premium on STAG‚Äôs yield, is it only the dividend growth or the secondary property locations?

After issuing the recall, there stock fell roughly 15% down to the low 80s.

They have their earnings report tomorrow, and I think they will fall, but how much is the question. I am thinking they will fall 3-5%. Another question: How far will they fall as a result of the incidents regarding their treadmills - we have already seen a drop from about 115 to 82 - oof!

At the beginning of the pandemic I bought at about 40 and sold at around 160. Recently I bought at 100 and sold for a small profit. Now, I am deciding if I should buy some in the coming days.

I see the recall as a short-term blip for them, and wonder if it‚Äôs being overblown a bit in terms of the impact. There is probably a decent population of people with the tread that won‚Äôt bother doing anything with the recall since they don‚Äôt have young kids or pets, or they have the tread situated somewhere where they don‚Äôt go. So yes, all the treads are recalled but not ‚Äúall‚Äù will actually have the customers take them up on it, and those won‚Äôt lead to any costs for PTON.

Ultimately, I'm just not sold on them as a company. We have one of the bikes and my wife rides it every day and loves it (I like it fine and ride it a few times a week).

But as others have said, I think a lot of its run up has been Covid related and people not going to the gym, etc. I'm not sure their sales and growth are sustainable over longer periods of time between people going back to gyms, increasing competition, etc. Also, if they lose any of their top instructors, does that cause earnings to take a hit? I don't know the answer to that, as it hasn't happened yet, but I could see it potentially being an issue.

Ultimately, I'll probably pass on trying to trade this news, as there's no telling what people might do in the short term."

I think Peloton is not fully to blame, the parents are also at fault as well. Peloton could have put those guards at the back and the parents could have not left their children unsupervised with the treadmill - I would imagine Peloton says not leave kids under a certain age unsupervised around it"
2021-05-06 07:47:12,stocks,I wouldnt buy in just because exercise brands and equipment tends to be very fad based.
2021-05-06 08:22:18,stocks,Absolutely agreed on the valuation. But have you seen their subscription rates? They are arguably a content provider that people find worthwhile enough to purchase an expensive piece of equipment for better integration.
2021-05-06 10:38:14,stocks,"It's a voluntary recall. Out of the over 30 folks I interact with at my company that have them, not a single person is going forward with the recall.

2021-05-06 08:30:39,stocks,"Look at their subscription rates. Consistent growth from people who don‚Äôt own the machines.

Also, gyms will be back soon. Is the consistent growth in subscribers who also own a device really all people who couldn‚Äôt hold out, and decided to buy the most expensive product on the market over a year into the pandemic?

Why does your wife like it so much? I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs because of the experience the subscription service provides.

Peloton doesn‚Äôt sell equipment. They sell an experience that makes people actually use equipment.

(FYI, not saying you should buy. I have questions about their leadership after their poor response to this situation.)"
2021-05-06 00:22:06,stocks,Huh. I went from vaguely knowing it was popular but rather expensive equipment that had chronic shipping problems‚Ä¶to it being that treadmill that eats babies. That is not ‚Äúgreat advertising time‚Äù.

And yeah, it‚Äôs *great* advertisement to see a woman nearly get bucked off a treadmill just because a yoga ball bumped into the belt. They should run that during the Super Bowl or something!

I do agree that the subscription service is the primary value they provide. But leadership botched their response to this big time."
2021-05-06 01:47:19,stocks,"Yup. A lot of those treadmills that they recall and fix won‚Äôt be going back to the customers who were using them as an overpriced clothes hanger. They‚Äôre also about to start losing an awful lot of subscription money.

Pro tip for PTON: put a fucking bar on your stupid overpriced treadmill like every other treadmill company does so that it doesn‚Äôt murder your customer‚Äôs children."
2021-05-05 23:58:02,stocks,"Hard pass. The hard is in reference to your conviction to pass, as in a firm hell to the no."
2021-05-06 09:10:50,stocks,Yes - they sell bikes but make money on the subscriptions. Recurring revenue from every buyer is what separates them from nearly every other exercise product. That's going to be their money maker in the long run.
2021-05-06 11:21:23,stocks,"Yeah, I don't think many people will take advantage of the recall - I have quite a few friends with Pelotons and they are keeping theirs"
2021-05-06 10:51:47,stocks,Good to know! I only know one person that owns one and she is keeping hers. It's a great treadmill. Just follow the safety guidelines that ALL treadmills have. We have a Precor and when it isn't being used as a clothes hanger I lock the door when I run on it.
2021-05-05 23:16:32,stocks,"Why‚Äôs it collecting dust? Recall doesn‚Äôt stop the ability to use it altogether. Tread classes are still running. So if it‚Äôs collecting dust then either the customer bought and doesn‚Äôt like it so they can use the recall as a way to get money back (not too concerned here since satisfaction is pretty high I believe with PTON product/experience), or the customer is concerned about using the product during the recall (most likely if they have young kids or little pets that can access it). In the latter, I think some will just wait for the guard or whatever piece they opt to add to fix it, or maybe it‚Äôs just a software update, and some will take PTON up on the offer to come out for free and move to another room in the house that‚Äôs less accessible by kids/pets."
2021-05-06 08:48:13,stocks,"It takes slightly more than 3 digital memberships to equal 1 full access, so even if they‚Äôre growing the non-owner rolls, it‚Äôs going to take more growth there due to the lower cost.

I don‚Äôt know who it is. But some of these folks are waiting months for delivery. Do they end up canceling orders? I don‚Äôt know that either.

My wife likes it because she likes not having to go into a gym. Lots of people like going into a gym. And I‚Äôd be willing to bet that for every person like her who is hooked, there‚Äôs someone like me who is ‚Äúmeh‚Äù about it - I use it because it‚Äôs here at the house and provides a good workout but there‚Äôs a lot of the ‚Äúpeloton culture‚Äù that I just find annoying.

I am aware, but given the pricing of their equipment, there available market is also not as large as some people think it might be. I.e. there‚Äôs a limited pool of people who can afford and/or will spend thousands of dollars on a bike or a tread and then pay monthly dues to be able to use it to its full capacity.

I don‚Äôt know about the quality of the competition‚Äôs hardware, but we‚Äôve had to have service out twice to replace the bearings and they probably need to be replaced again and have for a while. And we‚Äôve had the bike just over 2 years. I‚Äôm not an expert but that seems like a lot.

And I‚Äôm telling you, because of the ‚Äúexperience‚Äù they provide, and how into it some people are, if they lose one of their top instructors I am pretty confident they‚Äôll lose paying customers. I don‚Äôt know if, or when, that will happen but if it does it won‚Äôt be just a blip that gets ignored.

I don‚Äôt know. I just don‚Äôt see them keeping the same growth rates over the shorter term but I‚Äôm just a dude on the internet machine so what do I know.

Might see how much some LEAPs are and buy a couple of those to see what happens."

2021-05-06 00:00:00,stocks,"Vista Outdoor ($VSTO) pre-earnings DD Vista Outdoor ($VSTO) is not only a summertime hiking/camping/exercise play, which I think most everyone is looking forward to this year, it's the biggest manufacturer of ammo in the US. In fact, there are only two big civilian ammo manufacturers in the US (the other is $OLN), and VSTO dominates that market, including primers. They report earnings before open 5/6.

When they report, their TTM P/E will flip from above 35 to about 9 (yes, nine). They had a bad quarter 4Q ago as the company was undergoing some restructuring after a CEO change; so sometimes this stock has moved as if it's a high-P/E tech stock. But really, it's essentially a deep value stock that also has ""explosive"" growth in ammo sales. Their market cap was 25% higher under Obama and the company's core lines have grown since then. Gun folks buy more guns‚Äôn‚Äôammo under democratic administrations, not GOP ones. The prior CEO was replaced (excuse me: ""retired"") because he made some bad acquisitions which have since been divested, and better ones made instead (e.g. acquiring Remington‚Äôs ammo business). This stock benefits from civil unrest (note price bumps during G-Floyd riots last year), war, paranoia, etc. Basically: 'murica. You might have heard we nearly had some people in hats overthrow the government. Those people all buy ammo. Basically 15% of the country is gearing for civil war and VSTO had a billion dollar backlog at the end of 2020 -- about half their market cap. The national ammo shortage still persists to this day. Gun background checks are off the charts. VSTO has pricing power.

The weekly options are pretty high IV so they aren't an easy way to play this stock unless you're selling 'em. But I think VSTO is gonna pop on earnings, and long-dated options have much more reasonable IV. VSTO has multiple analyst upgrades recently (two major price target raises in the past two weeks), lots of free cash flow, and recently refinanced their completely reasonable debt to a higher credit quality. There's been good news about their new ammo plants (including Remington) coming online. It's a candidate for buybacks or a special dividend. They have 116 full-time job openings listed on their site; many of which are unrelated to ammo, so I guess those parts of their business are going well, too.

But wait, how have comparable stocks done this week in earnings? Is this industry healthy?

1. $OLN reported after close 4/27, nice beat on earnings, stock up over 10% since, multiple analyst price upgrades. They‚Äôre the other civilian ammo manufacturer (they have a pure chemicals biz for most of their revenue).
2. $BGFV reported after close 5/4, massive beat, stock up 30% the next day. Sporting goods retail.
3. $RGR reported after close 5/5, beat estimates by 50%, stock up after hours (we'll see how far it runs: earnings conference call is this morning 5/6 at 9am ET), quarterly cash dividend raised 145% compared to 4Q ago and 20% quarter-over-quarter. Gun manufacturer.
4. $VSTO reports before market open 5/6. Outdoor goods and ammo manufacturer...

The main risk I see is any possible supply chain disruption (or cost increases) due to shipping. But that just means demand is deferred forward, not denied, and they already have a huge backlog. Its price has also run up a lot in the past year (like many stocks), but it‚Äôs not near its 2016 market cap and not at its YTD high. Daily RSI is under 70 and trending up for those who care about technicals.

VSTO has a market cap of \~$2.1b. About half a NKLA, half an AMC, 1/5 of a GME, or 1/10 of a SPLK. Look up VSTO's numbers on finviz or macrotrends. I‚Äôll leave it at that.

Position: long shares @ $33. Long-term bullish. I might buy calls or sell puts, too.

tl;dr -- outdoorsman value stocks are reporting great earnings and VSTO is next in line, the country is a mess, you can buy ammo stock if you aren't just buying stocks of ammo.

Also I thought they reported after market close 5/6, so I was gonna post this in the morning, but apparently they report before market open (welp!). So I'm posting it now. Still useful, I hope, as this is not just a one-time earnings stock."

If you are convinced the companies are going to do well *and the balance sheets/quarterly reports support your thesis*, then you shouldn't worry about short-term share price. 

That can, and will, fluctuate. Day to day pricing, particularly when there is no relevant news, is not the company. 

If you step on a scale every day, your weight is going to fluctuate. If you went out to Super Buffet last night, ate crap for lunch, and weighed yourself right when you get home belly full of garbage, you might be 7 lbs heavier than you did in the morning on an empty stomach after you went out and ran 5 miles.

It doesn't change your actual weight. And over time, if you are trying to lose (or gain) weight... you have to consider all of these temporary factors. Over time, your true weight and the direction of it will sort of reveal itself. I mean, there is no Hardees Heart Attack burger that can account for 100lbs. 

And shoot... a healthy person can go out and eat at Super Buffet once in a while. But, when I examine the entirety of their diet plan, exercise plan, and execution of it, I will likely have a pretty good idea what their weight is and what direction they are going.

What do you think the actual value of the companies are? When you read the balance sheets and the quarterly report, does it look like they eating 50 ding dongs a day and getting two burrito supreme meals, while doing no activity? Or when you look at the health of the company, does it look like they are doing all the things that is helping them accomplish the stuff they say they are going to.

That said, if you are looking at UUUUP or DOOOOOWN, fuck all if I know. you be gambling. Put it all in that one coin and rocket that shit to the moon."

A lack of growth is bad for any company, but is particularly tough for those like Teladoc that are losing money, whose share prices are pegged to their growth potential.

Last Wednesday, the company reported a first-quarter net loss of $1.31 a share, [much worse than the 54 cents Wall Street expected.](https://www.barrons.com/articles/teledoc-health-drops-on-a-big-net-loss-51619645793) That news triggered more declines in the stock; it is now down 46% from its February peak.¬†¬†

But the latest selloff isn‚Äôt just the aftermath of the poor earnings. This week, concern mounted over whether Teladoc can retain its customers in an increasingly competitive space.

In [a *Wall Street Journal* article published on Monday](https://www.wsj.com/articles/digital-health-startups-are-booming-their-customers-are-overwhelmed-11620039601), [PepsiCo](https://www.barrons.com/quote/PEP) ‚Äòs former head of benefits Erik Sossa said that the firm stopped using Teladoc and switched to rival LiveHealth Online, partially because the digital-health service isn‚Äôt connected to PepsiCo‚Äôs existing health plan, making it impossible for doctors to see patients‚Äô health histories. 'Telemedicine is a fantastic medium, but if it‚Äôs just late-night urgent care, it‚Äôs kind of a commodity,' Sossa told the *Journal*.

Investors are concerned that contract losses could become a more frequent problem. A recent Credit Suisse survey shows that 81% of the responding companies are offering telehealth benefits to their employees via health insurers instead of direct contracts. A decision to do the same is likely behind PepsiCo‚Äôs shift away from Teladoc, according to Halper. One of the firm‚Äôs health insurers, Anthem (ANTM), was the previous owner of LiveHealth Online.""

Not to mention those in rural areas who drive long distances to see their docs.  Wear and tear on car, gas money, time suck.

That being said, Teledoc was one of the first entrants but was unable to take advantage of their position.  It seemed clunky to use and a few years ago, doctors using it were still charging only slightly less copay for a virtual than an in person visit.  Made no sense for the patient to pay more for less.

The fundamental question you have to ask is what does Teledoc offer than any health plan, health system, provider organization or otherwise can't do themselves?

Competition is fierce and barriers to entry are slim. Health plans simply can just contract telemedicine terms with their existing network of providers... Providers literally just need Zoom, or Teams, for hell, Google Meet if they are really in the poor house! and as the quote indicates, if there is not ready access to member's overall health records, well... what is the point here?

Health plans already have the records system, they already have actuaries, they already have analytics. 

What teledoc had, was a window of time before a pandemic where they could offer a service at below standard provider rates which would then save the health plans money. They could argue they would prevent ED visits and save them more money. But that window of time has eroded and I am not sure teladoc has their use case any longer. Some states are even out there actively making it harder on teladoc, by legislating telemedicine be reimbursed at in-person rates. There is now no margin there for teladoc..."

Disney Plus' growth will not sustain similar to what Netflix is seeing now.  The Law of large numbers with subscriptions will catch up with Disney plus soon.  The movie business is effected and will take 3-4 to fully recover if it recovers at all.   They have amazing parks and movie properties, but the MCU style success is probably behind them.

Wife talked about it for vacation but I got us to go to the more educational and cheaper space thing in FL.  They also had a lego VW and we had gone to Lego Land Previously.

2021-05-06 00:41:42,stocks,I am extremely bullish on them in some ways but have cooled off my expectations near term.

Personal bias is a great reason to buy a stock. You like the stock, you buy it. These are the signals that underpin the market and direct consumers to worthwhile/relevant/ethical investments. If you only chase profit, you are likely investing in products antithetical to your values. Ie, you might be dieing of copd / lung cancer but you are investing in cigarettes."

I just recall one practice was to issue credit at theme parks in the form of gift cards (these could be from returning merchandise or even handing out credit as an apology for a screw up in Disney's end) but registering the amount being put on gift cards as a sale and the time it was spent as an additional sale.

As in, Disney resorts didn't come clean my room, ""We're sorry, sir. Here's a $20 credit for your trouble. (Disney ledger: We just made $20!) Later that day, I spent the credit on merchandise. (Disney ledger: We made $40 dollars!)"

Ton of children are Dis addicts.
Imo if you want to hold long term the brand is very strong and well mantained.
When parks make a comeback and we have a ton of streaming subscribers it will be much more valuable.
Plus Disney barely scratches Gaming, if they are smart about it they could grow a ton more in this direction, very cheaply if they partner up with good studios and a gaming brand.
Cinema also wont die and will come back. 
The products they sell (physical toys and such) are very well made and craved by children.
They always set trends in the industry and have remarkable IP."

2021-05-06 09:15:01,stocks,"Keep in mind it makes a buttload of money on parks, and while those are technically open right now they are at severely limited capacity. And they will be making far less money this year from movies in theaters. So in the short term I think it's definitely a riskier play. Long time it's probably a good bet but they already have made most of their major acquisitions. If they try to make any more I could see them being charged with some sort of lawsuit, which could drop the price."
2021-05-06 09:19:23,stocks,I am. But all the credit and debit spreads I opened about a month ago are expiring over in June and I'm worried I made a terrible mistake there.  LOL

2021-05-06 10:00:25,stocks,It‚Äôs an expensive stock. And the fact that cruises and theme parks will open up is already priced into the current value.
2021-05-06 13:28:04,stocks,"Compare DIS to similar companies. DIS is weird to measure because its a combination of:

- online streaming platform
- resorts and cruises
- merchanidising
- theme parks
- media and production company

I think its really hard to value DIS personally, even though I'm super bullish.

Lets compare each of those sectors to market leaders via mkt cap:

Online Streaming: NFLX $220Bn

Cruises: CCL $30Bn

Theme Parks: SIX $3Bn

Media and Production: VIAC $24Bn

If you add up all those individual companies and made a chimera, you'd have a mkt cap of 277Bn.

DIS is trading at $330Bn mkt cap right now. So do you believe that DIS is worth more than all those companies combined? Its not apples-to-apples, but valuing DIS is just as difficult as valuing SONY or AAPL. When a company has so many different revenue streams, it can get complicated where the valuations go.

Just be aware that DIS bought Marvel in 2009. Back then DIS was trading at $23. After that purchase, DIS rallied to $90 then stayed for 5 years, pushing as high as $144 before the COVID crash.

So the question is, how much of the Marvel + StarWars + Fox catalogue is already baked into the price. And how much is left to grow.

I think we saw lots of reopening stocks rally in November in preparation for Joe Biden presidency and a strong push for vaccinations. We're seeing lots of reopening already priced in.

Also, don't forget that DIS operates many of its revenue streams in pretty shit margins.


Some additional history, DIS did FY2020 annual report on November 12. That week DIS jumped from $120 to $140 and rallied to $180 over the next few weeks.

https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/app/uploads/2020/11/q4-fy20-earnings.pdf

Look at page 3 where you can see the revenue breakdown by sector. You can see that their parks/experiences revenue was down 37% yoy and studio entertainment was down 13% yoy. Even if DIS posts a 100% yoy revenue increase in both those sectors in 2021 (which seems currently impossible), the cagr will only be 15% yoy growth compared to 2019.

With that all said, would you say that 15% yoy revenue growth justify a stock price increase in 2020 from $140 to $180 in 2020 (approx 30% increase)?

I think DIS will trade sideways for at least 2 more years until COVID totally clears up. Until then, I would say that online streaming revenues are priced in, along with the upcoming Marvel gen4 releases and all other things.


Like everyone else on this thread, DIS is a winner long term. But the next 3 years it may be not beat VOO. But when it starts firing on all cylinders again and all that pent up demand starts surging into parks and entertainment, expect DIS to rally hard."

2021-05-06 17:47:14,stocks,This is very anecdotal but I feel like their recent string of soulless live-action remakes of classic animated films screams risk aversion.

They may have made money but what‚Äôs next?
2021-05-06 02:40:07,stocks,"no

the whole...amusement parks, cruises...well, i dont know enough about that.

but the ""paid subscription"" stuff...thats going busto. you see, netflix and amazon and hulu...all they did was take over from cable companies...and instead of paying $60 for cable, you pay $10+$10+$10+10 for all these ""premier content subscriptions""..

it's the same problem, except a different name. they box you in and make you pay for packages of content when perhaps you just want to watch one or two shows.

and the other thing is, you can mostly find anything on these services for free online, if you know how to look. free tv streams are a thing. might be a hassle to find...but, once you know how to do it, its easy enough.

and the younger generation will be better at it. 

the whole industry needs to be re-innovated in my opinion. pay per channel. i pay $2 per channel i want to watch. idk how...but i dont consume media like that. seems dumb to subscribe to hulu when i can just get the stream for free. 

just my 2cts. but no, im not bullish on any media platforms at the moment. the whole industry seems to be headed for a hard reset."

Disney is currently worth 320, should be more like 150 or 160 if you going by current earnings, so that means there is already 160 million valued in. I wanted to buy Comcast but it seems everyone has caught on and everyone is buying Comcast and they have that Peacock platform.

I think that has more to do with the pandemic, which prevented them from releasing any more Marvel movies in theaters.

The fallout from the blowup of Archegos, which did much of thst betting, continues. But now VIAC especially has come down to a dirt cheap PE and has more cash on hand than ever after management did a savvy offering at 85 bucks.

Earnings are on Friday. I doubt it'll move the stock much. But long term, it's a buy. Safe. Has potential. Also pays a dividend.

These indicators LAG and the stock always acts indifferent to indicators, as they are a tool of the past performance of the stock.  Just look at how overbought Tesla stock was when it almost reached $1000.  Did people all of a sudden care about indicators when that happened? Or the stupid lines on their graphs? Indicators don't mean shit.  They might tell you when something is overbought or oversold, but it doesn't mean that the stock can't act differently in relation to that.  Only price performance (candlestick charts), volume, and overall market action influences prices.  If it was that easy to look at some bullshit indicators then everyone would be making money in the market"

I've done my fair share of day trading, made massive gains, then slowly gave most back in tiny losses.

The only way that I make money is buy when you think its low, and wait wait wait wait, then sell when you think the hype ran out."
2021-05-06 00:00:00,stocks,"RKT reports 91% adjusted revenue growth and 170% adjusted net income growth YoY. Q2 outlook dim - shares down 14% in after hours. https://ir.rocketcompanies.com/news-and-events/press-releases/press-release-details/2021/Rocket-Companies-Announces-First-Quarter-Results/default.aspx

Revenue and net income were down slightly QoQ but it's the projected 20% drop in originations for Q2 that is the big news, here. 

I've been on record multiple times saying how much of a red flag it is that the CEO only talks about growing market share. You can grow market share all you want but if your market shrinks 30-40% YoY (like the mortgage market would if it regresses to the average annual market size), your stock price isn't going anywhere. 

In other news, the war with United Wholesale Mortgage ($UWMC) seems to be going well. [The CEO of UWMC declared war on RKT two months ago declaring that they would no longer work with any brokers that also work with RKT.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lyfc11/begun_the_mortgage_wars_have/) RKT's volume from wholesale grew a little over 8% QoQ.

Things may slow down as supply continues to be tight but everywhere I look now there's building and my buddies still in the business are all busy, mostly reno but a few new builds.

My big concern with RKT is the amount of cash offers, i have been seeing a lot of news about institutions being major drivers of the tightening of supply. Then again i think I saw that aprox 36% of all home buys were cash this year which is only up slightly. Mostly cash in NE and west coast.

Since August of 2020 they've been calling for RKT to have slowdowns and bad quarters... which hasn't happened.  And as an originator, rising rates don't hit their margin as directly, it's more about a guess that demand will vanish.  But those making that guess have been wrong t every step of this cycle.  14 months ago they said real estate and lending would die rapidly.  10 months ago they said rocket had a lucky quarter that could never be repeated.  4 months ago they said treasuries would end the housing and mortgage booms.  

I mean I guess they'll eventually be right about something, but the track record is not great.

And i think these prices are going to be sticky, new home buyers need that much more cash saved up just to put in a down payment.

You may see steady growth over a long period with rkt, but not at percentages people have come to expect in this market. I think its probably priced fairly at high teens low 20s now.

2021-05-06 00:00:00,stocks,"Like it or not, it looks like a market crash is imminent. I made a post about a month ago that discussed the recent sentiment around a market crash coming soon. 

A month ago, a market crash seemed probable, but wasn‚Äôt anything major to worry about at the time in my opinion. Since then, I think it‚Äôs become especially evident that we may be on the cusp of a market crash.

Here‚Äôs my thesis. Feel free to approve or disapprove.

1. **The Buffett Indicator is peaking**

What this means, in essence, is that _the stock market may be overvalued at this time_. We have been hitting ATH after ATH; many stocks reaching that level with no clear reason why. Many stocks, particularly blue-chips have reached these levels rapidly, whilst the fundamentals of the company/stock remain unchanged.

2. **The US Government is pumping astronomical sums of money into the economy**

This isn‚Äôt necessarily a bad thing for the people of the US. However, it provides a possible reason behind what I discussed in my first point. With the passing of several bills, many amounting to trillions of dollars, there is a large net flow of money entering the economy, many of it entering into the stock market.

The issues surrounding COVID aren‚Äôt going to last forever, and the stimulus checks and financial assistance will not continue forever either.

Once we get to the point whereby large sums of money are NOT being pumped into the economy anymore, I think we are likely to see a stall, and that point may come soon as the country continues with it‚Äôs successful vaccination and reopening program.

3. **The influx of new investors**

More investors in the stock market is usually a great thing. However, with the large dip we saw in March 2020, I think that many people who may have considered investing for a while finally decided to start. I believe that this is part of the reason as to why the recovery was so quick. The large overvaluations can also be partially attributed to this reason as well. A new investor likely thinks to invest in companies such as AAPL and AMZN first, rather than doing a great amount of DD to find other stocks. And it makes sense, AAPL, AMZN and other blue-chips are safe investments in my honest opinion; they‚Äôre amongst the largest companies in the world. The problem lies with the large increase of money going into these stocks.

There are many other reasons, such as over-leveraging that would make this post exceptionally long if I went into it in detail. From a personal standpoint, I am deeply considering taking profits and leaving a large cash position available for the future.

Yes, time in the market beats timing the market, but if you had a choice between staying in a crashing market or dodging it, which would you choose?

**I am not a financial advisor, nor am I an economist or a financial strategist. This post simply contains some observations and personal opinions that you are free to agree or disagree with.*

2021-05-05 22:48:35,stocks,"I agree but don‚Äôt think points 1 or 2 are indicators or an imminent crash. The Buffett Indicator is a poor indication of when a market will correct. It just tells you if things are overvalued. The government is always spending astronomical sums of money. It doesn‚Äôt matter if the money comes directly through stimulus checks or buying military equipment, to the economy it‚Äôs the same. Someone is the beneficiary who should spend the money and grow the economy. 

I think the driving force behind a downturn will be inflation and interest rates. We‚Äôve already started to see signs of inflation with commodities like copper and lumber skyrocketing. We‚Äôre seeing shortages in chips for electronics. All of these point to higher prices coming. Higher prices means people start asking for raises, which cause high prices. The fed will have to raise interest rates. This hits stocks a few ways: 1) the higher cost of inputs and labor cut into profits as not all cost increases can be passed on the consumers 2) increased prices reduce demand so sales drop 3) higher interest rates make interest payment more expensive, again hitting bottom lines 4) increased interest rates means discount rates for DCF calculations should increase causing valuations to go down. 

Key dates: May 12 (then June 10) is the next CPI report. I think if inflation is higher than anticipated, the market sells off hard. If it comes in around expectations, the market could cautiously move higher until the June CPI report."

2021-05-05 21:01:13,stocks,"You're giving too much credit to the stimulus bills significantly raising stock market caps.

The federal interest rate being 0 is the main reason and as that goes up in time, there will be some drawbacks, but two points about that. I believe the Fed Reserve knows what they're doing, and then if I know this much, millions of people smarter than me with more money than me know this too... so it should all be a smooth transition. It's already expected. Stocks will keep going up even if there are some pretty bad months and we can't hit 100% a year returns until the next pandemic.

The catch is that we have to get the interest rates up before the next pandemic."

2021-05-05 21:14:33,stocks,"I‚Äôve made some decent dough over the last 3 years in the cannabis industry. Up until recently, most people invested in Canadian companies. The run-up to legalization in Canada was unbelievable and some of the Canadian stocks went up 8x-10x. We‚Äôre likely to experience the same thing here in the US with favorable legislation for cannabis very likely. It might not be full federal legalization immediately, but decriminalization, banking, and other bills are likely during the current administration. 

Most cannabis investors believe the US stocks are now the companies to be in, instead of the Canadian companies. The state of California has larger population than all of Canada, so there‚Äôs a lot more room for growth in the US. Additionally several of the top US cannabis operators are already profitable and growing quickly. This means that even without favorable federal legislation these US operators are still growing at an alarming rate. There are several legal states now and more are in the midst of legalizing. 

There‚Äôs a possibility we could see a good run in the next few weeks. Schumer is supposed to release his decriminalization bill soon and earnings are next week.

The Alcoholic beverage industry is more similar to Cannabis then cigarettes imo. There's a ton more competition in it then cigarettes, and imho it's probably going to be a lot more socially acceptable to use cannabis then to smoke cigarettes (at least in America) long term. There's also (long term) likely going to be less big government harassing cannabis companies for the harm their products do, unlike cigarette companies.

I honestly think big agriculture companies, or alcoholic beverage producers would have more of an advantage in the cannabis market than MO. I also think that full legalization is going to actually going to turn out very badly for a lot of cannabis companies,  due to all the new competition with much fatter wallets that will bring to the market."

2021-05-06 00:00:00,stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Wednesday, May 5, 2021 **PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, May 5, 2021**

Stocks reversed from yesterday‚Äôs technology-led selloff, with the Dow Jones (DIA) reaching a new intraday record high. Continuing the recent bout of volatility, the three major indexes sold off in the last few hours of the market session, with the Nasdaq (QQQ) turning negative.   Market participants continue to look towards the slew of corporate earnings, new economic data, and commentary from key monetary policymakers. 

The sharp move lower in stock yesterday came, ostensibly, after Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen suggested that interest rates may need to rise in the near-term to prevent the economy from overheating, with the recent economic data and corporate earnings showing economic activity recovering much faster than expected as effective distribution of the vaccine in the US allows states to gradually reopen. Yellen said, ‚ÄúIt may be that interest rates will have to rise somewhat to make sure that our economy doesn't overheat, even though the additional spending is relatively small relative to the size of the economy. It could cause some very modest increases in interest rates to get that reallocation, but these are investments our economy needs to be competitive and to be productive. I think our economy will grow faster because of them."" In later remarks, she added that raising rates was not something she was predicting or recommending and that the decision ultimately rests with the Federal Reserve. She said, ‚ÄúLet me be clear, that‚Äôs not something I‚Äôm predicting or recommending. If anybody appreciates the independence of the Fed, I think that person is me.‚Äù

With the major indexes hovering near record levels for many consecutive days, equities were due for a pullback at the slightest mention of bad news. Kevin Mahm, chief investment officer at Hennion and Walsh Investment Management said, ‚ÄúI do think there's a potential for a short-term bounce in volatility due to those excessive valuations and all of the uncertainty that currently stands with respect to the infrastructure spending bill, ultimately how it‚Äôs going to be funded, and certain taxation policies. But, beyond the short-term bouts of volatility, there is continued reason for optimism, whether it‚Äôs consumer confidence, whether it‚Äôs the strength in earnings, recognizing that thus far we have an 86% beat rate for the companies that have reported.‚Äù

The Labor Department will release its April jobs report on Friday, which is expected to show a staggering nearly 1 million payrolls came back last month, accelerating March‚Äôs gain. As a reminder, in March, the Department of Labor reported nonfarm payrolls increased by 916,000 for the month while the unemployment rate fell to 6% (unemployment rate was 14.6% in April 2020). Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for an increase of 675,000 and an unemployment rate of 6%.

**Highlights**

* As a reminder, the April Labor Report will be released on Friday. Will be important in gauging how the labor market is doing
* Shares of Peloton (PTON) sold off sharply after the company issued a recall of its Tread+ and Tread treadmills following a slew of accidents, including the death of a child. A few weeks ago, John Foley, CEO of Peloton, resisted calls from the US Consumer Product Safety, something he called a ‚Äúmistake‚Äù. He said, ‚ÄúPeloton made a mistake in our initial response to the Consumer Product Safety Commission‚Äôs request that we recall the Tread+. We should have engaged more productively with them from the outset. For that, I apologize.‚Äù
* Tomorrow, May 6, EV maker NIO will hold a news conference where the company is expected to talk about its plans to expand to the European markets.

* The U.S. Commerce Department is pressing Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) and other Taiwanese firms to prioritise the needs of U.S. automakers to ease chip shortages in the near term, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said.
* Factory orders rose 1.1% in March over February after a 0.5% drop the month prior, according to the Department of Commerce. This was still slightly short of 1.3% estimates.

2021-05-06 06:27:10,stocks,"with banks there are a lot of things to consider and many metrics to look into. You need to determine the profitability drivers of each bank. For example:

\- Consumer: these include deposits (which are an expense for banks) and mortgages. You can look at mortgage rates, the housing sector etc. to determine whether this unit will do well. Higher interest rates may have a negative impact on this unit as appetite for mortgages may drop and their expenses increase (they pay more to depositors in interest payments). On the other hand, higher interest rates on loans may provide a higher income to the bank.

\- Corporate: small business confidence and general trends in the SME sector

\- Investment banks: these units tend to be more volatile as revenues/profits are based on trading (up and down with investor appetite) and equity/debt issuance (it was a hot IPO market last year and the start of this year), which are irregular

\- Asset management: some banks have AM units, where revenues are based on assets under management (obviously one factor is market performance: if markets go up, AuM goes up) so these tend to be more mixed as they are based on inflows/outflows

Other factors to consider are their capital structures/adequacy and other regulatory metrics that may have some information on the bank's health"
2021-05-06 00:00:00,stocks,"Most Don't Beat The S&P 500 Index As many of you know, the S&P 500 Index is a great way to invest as it reduces all your individual stock risk also known as non-systematic risk and we have been lucky to have had some great years of a strong bull market. 

Most professionals don't beat the index and only a select few beat it and the ones who beat it usually don't beat it the following year. Why would you or me be able to beat the market? The answer is we probably won't and we are better off just investing in SPY (S&P 500 ETF). 

We waste time (our most valuable resource) and money to individually pick stocks and in a lot of cases, we don't beat the index and sometimes lose money. 

One of my favorite investors/teachers  Aswath Damodaran said something along this ""I pick stocks because I love the process of looking at companies and analyzing them and in the end if I lose money or do worse than the index, I am fine with that because I did something I loved"".

I pick stocks because I love the process of trying to find ""undervalued"" stocks and learning more about industries and hoping to make money, but I also own an S&P 500 index. I am okay if I lose money because I knew the risks beforehand. If you don't like the process of researching or spending time looking at stocks, you are probably better of investing in an index.

Good luck investing"

The way you are looking at finance professionals is all wrong. All the juice for their existence are the fees.

There is a lot of youtube and otherwise content on internet explaining all of this better than i could, but lets go.

You open up a fund and manage it, here is the hardest part, you have to convince bunch of rich people or tons of poor people to invest in your fund, that is the only reason why they are essentially trying in the first place.

For example fee is flat 1%, you convinced tons of rich people to invest in your fund, for every hundred mils put into that fund, you straight up earn a million.

That fee money goes directly in your pocket, its absolutely ludicrous how much money you can get directly in your pocket. You get tons of rich contacts or a very popular fund, you can walk away with multiple retirements worth of money.

Most people will think like ''but fam, they are managing a fund and its a lot of work to manage a fund, they probably have to finance entire offices with hundreds of workers working day and night''

actually to pocket most of the fees you make your operation as small as humanly possible, many funds have been discovered to have only very few people in it, and all that time you spend wondering how they are all working hard in their offices every day to keep the thing going while most of the time nobody is working on anything at all, and if they have bunch of algo that might be even more the case.

[https://www.aei.org/carpe-diem/more-evidence-that-its-really-hard-to-beat-the-market-over-time-95-of-finance-professionals-cant-do-it/](https://www.aei.org/carpe-diem/more-evidence-that-its-really-hard-to-beat-the-market-over-time-95-of-finance-professionals-cant-do-it/)

You really think 95% of them are that stupid ? Or maybe only reason the funds exist is because you can directly extract and pocket ludicrous amount of money through fees your customers pay you.

That is also how we get to actual ponzi schemes. The line between what is and what isn't a ponzi scheme can be so thin many people had no idea they were working for one.

2021-05-06 02:15:01,stocks,"If you do buy the index funds, keep a close eye on the charts. Watch the technical indicators to decide when to buy (Relative Strength, Bollinger Bands and moving averages). One tried and true method is to buy when the 5 day moving average crosses the 30 day moving average going up, and sell when the 5 day crosses the 30 day moving down. You get some false buy and sell signals, and you don't catch the tops or bottoms, but that does generally catch the major moves going up, and avoids most of the major moves going down. 

With markets near an all time high, this might be a good time to keep some powder dry and wait for a correction."

2021-05-06 15:03:44,stocks,"Did you know:  


You can beat S&P500 by buying S&P500.  


If you had around 50k in the beginning of 2000 and you bought SPY when market opened Jan 2nd 2000 at 148.25+1%=$149.73 you would had 333 shares. Their total cost today would've been 333x416=$138,528 which is 277% growth over initial investment, excluding dividends.  


Now if you instead bought a single share every month at a market open price +1%, you would have had 257 shares, total costing you approx. same 50k.   


Now you wonder how does that beat buying it all at once at start and holding 333 vs 257 shares? Well, it does not exactly, it does not due to a rapid growth of SPY **in the past two years** \- 2019 SPY performance 31.29%, 2020 SPY performance 18.25%.  


In every other year buying shares over time shows better performance than market itself.  


TLDR: Buying SPY every month beats market performance."
2021-05-05 21:24:52,stocks,"Great comment. Only thing I would say about the last paragraph is that in fact, ""value"" investing is possible even in large cap stocks. For example, as a non-professional investor, I won't get fired (by myself) if I decide to concentrate 100% of my PA to just one large cap stock and initially underperform for an extended period. For example, holding AAPL since 2015 would have returned 414% vs 128% for the SP500 and arguably with not that much more risk. But try doing that if you're a hedge fund guy (after a while, it would be reasonable for your customers to inquire why they are paying you 2/20 when they could just hold AAPL themselves and watch it underperform the indices).

2021-05-05 20:59:55,stocks,"3 Reasons:

1. Laws. Namely, checks and balances. These dont exist in most countries or are very weak.
2. Natural resources. USA has more than any other country and is in a prime location. They are self sustaining and only import stuff because its cheaper. Not because they need to.
3. Ability to defend said resources. The #1 military and #1 tech innovator of the world both of which, help defend from outside aggression. Other countries are easier to manipulate and corrupt. Which brings us back to #1 above.

Other reasons. Good population to resource balance. This is one reason China or India havent been able to get ahead despite more people. Their balance isnt good but I will say that with energy innovation and energy getting cheaper (as it has through history), the ability to easily sustain more people will ease. The push in solar and batteries might change world powers in the next 20 years. We will see.

They may have laws to protect their people, but in general, they are easier to dodge than here in the USA. Thus when it comes to business (run by the rich), corruption is high in most countries. Investing in such places is thus extremely risky because politics plays a big part in their economies and due to other factors, their currency is very risky too. There are some exceptions but few.

Here in the USA, anyone can sue at any time. Its a double edge sword but its there for a reason. This affords anyone the process of law. In most other countries, there is no such thing and if you tried to go after a politician or rich person, you would get steamrolled in court and in some you get outright killed. Here in the USA even the president cant make a lawsuit go away and thats not for the lack of trying. Thats the real power of checks and balances here in the USA. 

Again there are exceptions, especially in EU, but its rare in the rest of the world. Middle East for example is ultra corrupt because of the ruling families as is most of Asia including China. Perhaps not Japan. South America is a poster child of corruption and so is most of Africa. Even some EU countries are a joke when it comes to controlling their corporate elites and lets not forget the center of corruption up in Russia.

**tldr;** Drone Delivery Canada isn‚Äôt here to replace postal workers in the next 10 years but has many use cases and a lot of revenue potential. It is currently an unprofitable growth stock that seems very promising. At $1.33 (CAD) this is a buy and I have a price target of $6.87 5 years out based on a 10 price to sales ratio.

&#x200B;

*All numbers are in Canadian Dollars unless mentioned otherwise*

**Basic Stats: - (as of May 4, 2021)**

Price: $1.33

Market Cap: 279.38M

EPS: -0.08

Float: 209.61M

&#x200B;

**Description**

Drone Delivery Canada (DDC) provides a drone delivery platform targeted towards various corporations including retailers, service organizations and government agencies and are capable of transporting up to 180kg over 200kms. They have a patented hardware/software platform. DDC has been developing its drone delivery technology since 2014. They are currently trading on the TSX.V Exchange under the symbol FLT, on the U.S. OTC Q B market with Nasdaq International Designation under the symbol TAKOF. As a venture company that is not profitable it is a risky investment but there are many upsides to investing in this innovative technology.

&#x200B;

**Financials**

The company has reported assets worth $29M and $2.27M worth of liabilities so there is currently little worry of insolvency. With $23.4M in cash and yearly operating expenses of $14.5M, assuming no change, the company can operate with no financing for 1.6 years. This isn‚Äôt much of a worry due to increasing revenue and ease of financing.

2020 revenue was $265k and their total operating expenditure was $14.5M totaling a loss of $0.08 per share in 2020. Operating expense dropped in 2020, some key differences is an increase in advertising and marketing spend, a reduction in consulting expenditure, and an increase in personnel expenses. Research and development expenditure was almost the same which is good to see as they are still investing heavily in their technology.

Analyst estimate 2021 revenue of $6.59M which is over 2000% increase. While it is also expected for operating expenses to increase it‚Äôs good to see extreme revenue growth to match their high valuation of 271M. The current price/sales ratio is 1,021, assuming the same stock price and sales of $6.59M the price/sales ratio decreases to 41 which is much more reasonable, though realistically share price will increase this year. But even at twice the share price the price/sales ratio is 82 (which is still very high but much more reasonable than current, goes to show markets value future earnings). 2021 estimated EPS is -0.05 and profitability is expected in 2022.

The last thing to point out in DDC‚Äôs financial statements in they continue to invest heavily in patents. $140k in spent on patenting and trademarks in 2020 and $221k in 2019. With patents worth $750k as of December 31, 2020.

&#x200B;

**Ownership and Leadership**

0.2% of shares are held by private companies, 0.48% by individual insiders, 7.08% by institutions and the rest by the general public. The low insider holding is often seen as a bearish factor, but the low institutional holding can hold potential upside as once the stock is up listed, we can see large purchases as companies start adding shares to funds.

Leadership:

The CEO Michael Zahra has been the President of Staples Business Advantage (B2B supplies), the president of Yahoo, and has been on the board of directors for Oak Ridges Moraine Land Trust and on the board of governors for North York General Hospital. So, while this is a start-up, they have a veteran leader. They have a strong lineup of C-Suite executives with experienced CFO and CTO. On top of this their board of advisors include the VP of Cargo at Air Canada, and a medical director for Sunnybrook Centre for Prehospital Medicine which is an important strategic piece. The downside of their leadership is they have very high salaries for a company not making any profit.

&#x200B;

**Current Factors**

These are 3 current small factors that are worth mentioning

Partnership with DSV:

DDC entered in an agreement with DSV through its sales agent Air Canada that provides its drone delivery platform back in October 2019. The program became operational in March which was big for DDC as it is their first source of revenue. In which customers pay DDC a monthly fee for each drone route deployed. DSV provides and manages supply chain solutions for thousands of corporations. Which is a perfect partner for DDC. The initial agreement is for 15 months, with additional 1-year terms following the success of the first agreement.

Partnership with Edmonton Airport:

This partnership creates the world‚Äôs first airport drone delivery hub at Edmonton Airport using DDC‚Äôs platform. DDC and Edmonton airport will implement promote and market DDC‚Äôs delivery services. The agreement is for 5 years initially with the possibility of an extension unless the agreement is terminated

Patents:

DDC currently holds two US patents, one for its ‚ÄúFLYTE management‚Äù and one that covers aspects of its drone delivery technology and processes relating to controlled access zones for UAV landing and takeoff

&#x200B;

**Future Use Cases and Catalysts**

Medical Response:

In 2019 researchers tested the speed of drones vs the speed of ambulances to respond to a 911 call. The drone carried an AED to the location which was approx. 8km away. The drone was allowed to fly at speeds of 80km/hr and arrived at the scene an average of three to four minutes before the ambulance. Those few minutes could make a life or death difference in a cardiac arrest patient‚Äôs outcome. This is why having the medical director for Sunnybrook Centre for Prehospital Medicine on the board of advisors could be a key to implementing their services to the medical field in the future.

US Expansion:

DDC has expressed their intention to expand to the United States in the past, which is in line with them filing US patents. Expanding into the US will open tons of new opportunities for them but will also be a large challenge.

Potential to move to TSX:

Moving up from the venture exchange to the TSX can pose many benefits. A big one that we care about is increase in share price. ‚ÄúAn observation of 34 companies that graduated between October 14, 2005 and August 10, 2006, found that almost sixty per cent of the companies had an average share price over the thirty trading days post-graduation that was higher than the thirty trading days preceding graduation. On average, the share price of all 34 issuers went up over three per cent in that time frame, with four companies showing an increase of over 25 per cent‚Äù.

&#x200B;

**Market Size**

In Ark Invest‚Äôs *BIG IDEAS 2021* report they talked about the delivery drone market. They predict that drone delivery platforms will generate nearly USD50 billion in revenues, USD14 billion in hardware sales, and USD3 billion in mapping revenues by 2025. And by 2030 drone delivery platforms will generate nearly USD275 billion in revenues, USD50 billion in hardware sales, and USD12 billion in mapping revenues.

For a total market cap of $67B USD by 2025 and $337B USD by 2030.

&#x200B;

**Air Canada Cargo Partnership**

In Canada, 150K routes have been identified with their partner Air Canada Cargo. DDC‚Äôs revenue per route is $10,000/month. They are not even close to operating 150K routes so let‚Äôs start with 100 routes and build up.

|**Routes**|**Revenue/month**|**Yearly Revenue**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|100|$1M|$12M|
|1,000|$12M|$144M|
|10,000|$120M|$1.44B|
|25,000|$250M|$3B|
|150,000|$1.5B|$18B|

&#x200B;

**Valuation**

Now let‚Äôs take that estimated yearly revenue and calculate share price based off price/sales ratio (assuming a 10x p/s which is a lot lower than current p/s).

|**Yearly Revenue**|**Market Cap**|**Share Price**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|$12M| 120M|$0.57|
|$144M|1.44B|$6.87|
|$1.44B|$7.2B\*|$34.35|
|$3B|$15B\*|$71.56|
|$18B|36B\*\*|$171.74|

^(\*reduced P/S ratio to 5)

^(\*\*reduced P/S ratio to 2)

It‚Äôs important to note that the bottom 3 numbers are highly unrealistic in the next 5-10 years and require perfect execution and market factors to reach that point even past 10 years. A more realistic target would be a share price of $6.87 5 years out (furthest out analyst prediction is $116.8M of revenue 4 years from now). This is assuming a 10x p/s which aligns for an emerging technology company. A 5 year prediction of 120M in revenue is also falls in line with the previously mentioned $67B drone delivery market size by 2025 predicted by Ark Invest.

A $6.87 price estimate 5 years out at present value, assuming an 8% return found in index funds, equals $4.61.

&#x200B;

**Bear Case(s)**

Currently DDC is fitted for serving remote areas as there is a lot of regulation surrounding flying drones in urban areas. It‚Äôs also unrealistic to have dozens of drones flying around a city anywhere in the near future We need to see a shift in regulation for this to really take off. Big players such as Amazon and FedEx have been investing in delivery drone technology for years and most likely have very developed technology and infrastructure too. This does leave potential for a buyout if a company is trying to catch up to its competitors who have been investing in drone delivery. While financing will be relatively simple for this company this poses the risk of share dilution as they continue to spend money on research, patents, and other the expenses the company will need to sell more shares for cash flow.Lastly, their technology currently only allows delivery on predetermined routes that are from point A to point B and require a launch and landing pad so more technological development needs to happen.

&#x200B;

This technology isn‚Äôt here to replace postal workers in the next 10 years but has a lot of different use cases now and will have more in the future.

""We just reported the best first quarter in the history of the Company where net income attributable to Green Brick over the last twelve months through March 31, 2021 grew to $123.7 million, a 100% increase over the prior twelve-month period. Our first quarter net orders of 1,082 homes and ending backlog of $996 million both represent all-time records for the Company, up 28% and 45% over Q4 2020 record levels. To meet the unprecedented demand, Green Brick started a record 2,043 homes in the last six months and ended the quarter with 2,303 units under construction, a 62% increase from a year ago. We feel confident that our efforts will produce heightened earnings beginning next quarter and each successive quarter this year.‚Äù

Combine that with record low interest rates, a very low PE ratio, and of course a 12.5% decline makes sense...

2021-05-06 00:00:00,stocks,"Does Gambler's Fallacy Apply to the Stock Market? The Gambler's Fallacy is the incorrect belief that the probability of some independent event is affected by previous events. One example would be the belief in streaks in gambling, where the gambler assumes they are more likely to win the next hand because they've lost several in row.

My question is what evidence do we have to establish an independence between different days (or any time frame) of the stock market? I commonly see people say ""only buy on a red day."" Assuming different days are independent events, this is an example of the Gambler's Fallacy. However, if a day's performance is dependent on previous days, there could in fact be guidelines to follow for when to buy/sell.

Is anyone aware of a study of how the probability of a green or red day varies based on the performance of some amount of preceding days (or some other time frame)? I have no doubt this technical analysis exists, I just haven't found the results."
2021-05-06 06:58:35,stocks,"I did a bit of research on capital markets theory in my master's. There are some insights on this topic here and enough literature:

There is no autocorrelation (correlation between day n and day n+1) on a daily basis. That is, the price is independent of yesterday's price. But on a monthly basis one can observe this effect. Last month's price has a (slight but significant) effect on the current month. This is also called ""momentum effect"". If you take the best companies of an index (those with the highest performance in the last three months) and sell the others short, you get the Winner-Minus-Looser-Factor (WML). This is a factor from the Fama/French 5 Factor Model and it has been performing better than the market for decades.

So that means there is something like momentum, but only on a monthly/semi-annual basis, not short-term."

2021-05-06 01:08:59,stocks,"I'm still pretty new to investing, so I could be wrong on this, but from what I understand, the prices are set based on how people *think* they should be set. A garbage stock could go up if enough people with enough money think it'll go up, because they are willing to buy the stock for higher and higher prices, expecting it to still go higher and give them a return. Likewise, a solid company could see a drop in share price just because people expect for whatever reason that the price will drop anyway.

So if a stock does poorly one day, maybe it would actually be valid to reason that it is more likely to do better the next day because people are going to think that others think that the chances of it going up are higher because of the previous drop. Basically, if enough people think others fall for the gambler's fallacy, it stops being a fallacy, because people set the prices, not dice."

Dice have set probabilities. The chances of rolling a hard six in craps is always exactly 1 in 36. Always. It doesn't matter how many times you've rolled a 36 previously, the chances you roll a hard six on your next roll is 1 in 36.   


The stock market is NOT a pair of dice. Previous events impact future events. For example, there are conditions that once they happen, they make it more likely for other events to occur. For example, a stock that goes up 3 days in a row and is up 40% might have a much higher probability of going up on day 4 and by an even greater percentage if people have shorted that stock. That is an example where previous events have an effect on the outcome of future events.

You are absolutely, without a doubt, fucking wrong on this one."

2021-05-06 00:00:00,stocks,"Results of 30 days of tracking all Reddit Sentiment Data (round 3) For those that missed the original post, [here it is](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m71xi8/a_month_of_tracking_stock_scrapers_for/).

The struggle with the original data is that although it narrowed down the list of potential tickers to buy substantially, there were still often dozens or over 100 that were left, and with those that were left it was hard to determine which ones to buy. Obviously I needed to add in more criteria and start tracking what it did to the list of potential buys. To be nice I'll put the TL;DR up top here, if you're interested in the full details scroll down

&#x200B;

**TL;DR**

1. Even though I've preached against pennies forever, it turns out that Pennies with a Reddit score of 250 - 300 and Reddit Score Change value of 0% have the highest probability of going green and highest profitability  
**Reddit Score:** 250 - 300  
**% of going Green vs Red:** 500%  
**Average % gain:** 27%  
**Average timeframe to max gain:** 9.33 days
2. **Note that if you go to the sheets it will take a while to load.** They're big and have a ton of calculations going on. They'll show a lot of data errors until they've loaded up. It usually takes about 1 - 3 minutes. I recommend downloading or copying your own version
3. [Here is an IMGUR link with screen shots of the results of the data](https://imgur.com/gallery/ou0La7u) for those who can't get access to the sheets once they start blowing up
4. **What stocks should you buy?** I don't know, that changes from day to day. Although I track the data daily I only actually pay attention to it when it's time to buy. Then I see which categories are doing best at that moment, filter out the tickers based on that criteria, and go through the list. Sometimes there will be 4 - 10, sometimes none, sometimes 1. Depends on the day. If I don't see anything I like I just wait until the next day.

&#x200B;

**Some of the issues with the original data:**

1. The list of potential candidates was always too big, with no indicator of how to narrow it down  
Resolution: I started tracking **Change in Reddit Score** (how much the conversation shifted on the ticker) and **Stock Price**
2. When sharing the data no one could get into the sheet, since Google doesn't like big data and lots of visitors. **Here are some ways to get to the data now:**  
**Resolution 1:** [Here's a link to the folder itself](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zYQu74mVj0IVxVH33HHVdRcL9V2AjxLO?usp=sharing). May the odds be ever in your favor

5. **Resolution 5:** [Here is an IMGUR link with screen shots of the results of the data](https://imgur.com/gallery/ou0La7u) for those who can't get access to the sheets once they start blowing up

&#x200B;

**Here are the new items I began tracking with this data:**

1. **Reddit Score Change:** This signifies the amount of change in conversation on Reddit about that ticker. I wanted to see if an increase or decrease in conversation mattered
2. **Stock Price:** This seems obvious, but previously I didn't care what the stock price was - just how much conversation surrounded it. I introduced it in this version so I could see if each pricing category had their own levels of conversation that affected buy-in times. Turns out it does
3. **SPACs:** I tracked SPACs with the data and on their own. Turns out they're not that great
4. **% Shorted:** Honestly I haven't done a lot with this yet, but I'm starting. The category is there if you want to crunch the numbers to see if there are clear indicators on whether or not stocks shorted at a specific % have a higher likelihood of being squeezed. Let the numbers do the talking, not the echo chambers

&#x200B;

**What I continued to track:**

1. **Reddit score:** How much conversation is happening about that stock. It's all from the [Unbias scraper](https://unbiastock.com/reddit.php). I chose this one because of the plethora of data and how easy it is to copy/paste it all into a table. I don't own the site but I recommend everyone buy him a cup of coffee
2. **Days to Max Price:** How long should you hold? (How many days on average does each category take to get to its highest price?)
3. **Max % Gain:** When should you sell? (What average % gain is that category getting?)
4. **% of Y vs N:** Did the stock go up (Y) or down (N)? What's the % of time you can expect that category to go up instead of down? The bigger the % between the two the higher your odds of success in that category

&#x200B;

In the end really good data came from it. I had no biases entering into this but I was still surprised to see pennies perform as well as they did. Even without them, there are definitely sweet spots for whatever type of stock you're buying. Just run SPACs, Pennies, and all the rest separately since they each pull the data different directions.

&#x200B;

Good luck! To save my inbox I've tried to answer all the questions I could in previous comments and on the sheets themselves. I'm not selling this, making any money off it in any way, and don't really care if anyone follows the data or not, so this is just a passion project from a data nerd. Do with it what you will. 

&#x200B;

I know I should put it online or use Github or something - I don't know how to do all of that. I'm an excel nerd, and that's about it. If you know how and want to do the work I'm more than happy to share all my calculations, data, background stuff, etc - I even left the calculations in the sheets so you can see how they work yourselves if you want them."

2021-05-06 14:14:28,stocks,"I like fcel, with the growing need for ev related products im sure they will see some growth in the coming months. Its trading a little lower right now, but can easily double"
2021-05-06 10:47:12,stocks,"wow your right i just looked into it, very interesting thanks"
2021-05-06 10:45:09,stocks,when you say medium term for HUN  is that about a 6 months -1 year timeline? thanks
2021-05-06 10:43:42,stocks,yeah i was reading about that the other day.
2021-05-06 10:43:12,stocks,Whats a good target buy price for DAC? thanks
2021-05-06 08:40:34,stocks,I had an ETF for this but sold with a little profit. I might buy again after elections in Germany.
2021-05-05 20:05:57,stocks,How big of a market are sex shops?  I‚Äôve only seen them in sketchy strip malls and at highway truck stops.
2021-05-06 10:47:58,stocks,"thanks for posting that, seems legit and a good sign"
2021-05-06 10:46:30,stocks,"interesting i like HUN over EPD, im new to these 2 stocks.  whats a better value play at its current price? thanks"
2021-05-06 10:42:44,stocks,nice
2021-05-06 14:12:12,stocks,Elections in germany? How does this relate?
2021-05-05 20:45:47,stocks,"I imagine it varies a lot by area but definitely non-zero. We'd get between 25-150 people in our shop a day, more so evenings and weekends, selling between 3/4k-8k on a given day. 

Pretty broad array of customers. Older folk and couples would come in, from inexperienced to experienced and knowing what they want. Lots of the younger generation is pretty open about sex these days two so young couples getting stuff with one another and young single people finding ways to take care of themselves at home. Then you have the only fans and bikini barista girls shopping for outfits, and anyone 18+ can buy cbd products....

I'd say a moderate sized market from my limited sampling in Everett, Washington. In my birth state of Utah I haven't worked at a store to know the #'s but Blue Boutique has several locations and has been in business over a decade and continues to grow, in a liberal city in a conservative state. 

Sorry for the ramble, does that give you some idea?"
2021-05-06 10:49:29,stocks,"they have like kink communities and underground venues, its not something people really talk about.  theres also a ""expo"" that travels around selling toys and etc it draws alot of crowds"
2021-05-06 10:50:26,stocks,"thanks for the dd, hope your store does well"
2021-05-05 20:31:54,stocks,Yes
2021-05-05 22:15:32,stocks,"Cathie bought Peloton today. Considering her recent track record, I wouldn't be surprised if it drops further now.

*rolls eyes*"
2021-05-05 22:10:03,stocks,Honestly I feel sorry for Peloton ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è but it‚Äôs terrible that a kid died.  Lock up yo home gym homey.
2021-05-05 20:28:35,stocks,Are they covering the shipping cost? Calls on ups
2021-05-06 00:23:56,stocks,"I can't help but wonder the statistics on other treadmills.  Seems like someone falls off one or has their sweatshirt pulled under every time I'm at the gym.  Seems like something else going on here.  They have already put in place a security update on the existing tread that you need to create a code to start it up.  I would have also made something like a car bumper at the first instance that could slip over the back end.  Seems like there are solutions other than full recall.  The upside, and what I think they are banking on, is that its a good product and that only a small percentage will actually ask for the refund."
2021-05-05 22:38:35,stocks,Cries in was holding at $150...
2021-05-05 22:53:43,stocks,"I bought the peak. Welcome everyone to the bag holding club. It‚Äôs cold, dark and lonely."
2021-05-06 02:08:38,stocks,"Mike Tyson's daughter died on a treadmill, and I don‚Äôt remember that company recalling all their treadmills."
2021-05-05 20:47:12,stocks,Can we get commercials of the attractive models returning and boxing up their bikes
2021-05-05 20:05:31,stocks,"I bet they‚Äôre like ‚Äúthis company doesn‚Äôt want us to make money! They suck!‚Äù 

> realizes it‚Äôs a safety commission and stock dies instead of doing it safely and effectively minimizing losses

Hopefully this will teach other companies to listen to something that would benefit you.. but I know that‚Äôs unlikely lollll"
2021-05-05 21:14:13,stocks,How much sales are the treadmills projected to make up initially this year? They probably need to lower guidance going forward.
2021-05-05 21:56:39,stocks,[https://youtu.be/onXNnlCYJ4Y](https://youtu.be/onXNnlCYJ4Y)
2021-05-05 22:21:44,stocks,"Bought multiple long dated puts today and quite frankly, long overdo.  These will print.  Only regret is that I didn‚Äôt short them sooner. So much downside that this is free money. 6 other manufacturers making subscription treadmill and none have this horrible publicity.  Zoom out on the chart. This is a coronavirus stock and guess what? In the us, it‚Äôs winding down. Can‚Äôt believe people sold me these puts today ü§°"
2021-05-05 23:45:53,stocks,"No ones talking unit numbers. They‚Äôve sold 126,000 treads, and total units sold are 1.63m (which means they sold 1.5m bikes).

Treads are a small part of their business (should have been a growing part, but that‚Äôs not happening now).

So I‚Äôm ready to buy in tomorrow, these setbacks are a great time to get in, the market‚Äôs been shedding growth stocks like PTON but they‚Äôve got plenty of room to grow, find commercial channels and partnerships, and the community isn‚Äôt going anywhere."
2021-05-06 07:52:04,stocks,time to buy on this dip?
2021-05-05 20:34:40,stocks,"I'm actually surprised it's not down more. This is devastating. Everything....Everything, recalled."
2021-05-05 22:31:58,stocks,Just imagine when the lawsuits hit.
2021-05-06 03:03:08,stocks,$4000 for a treadmill....... What the fuck man
2021-05-05 22:19:00,stocks,"From a fundamental POV Peloton handled this atrociously.

If they agreed to speedily recall their products, sure. That would have been a classy move, maintaining a positive brand image.

The fact that Peloton initially refused to recall their treads before pretty much being forced to will leave a bad taste in consumers' mouths."
2021-05-06 00:06:47,stocks,Buy puts on peloton ... Fuck it
2021-05-05 22:41:07,stocks,I read that they didn't put a back guard on it even though most treadmills have it in order to stop things from being pulled under the machine so I can see where this is more a design flaw than just user error.
2021-05-05 22:55:17,stocks,I wrote my assignment on this. Why in the name of whoever this had to happen now?ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
2021-05-05 23:35:45,stocks,Me i sold puts
2021-05-05 23:35:51,stocks,"Pretty bad timing for peloton. With summer around the corner and vaccines roll out, most people will go back to gyms."
2021-05-06 00:28:18,stocks,"Someone bought a few hundred PTON May ‚Äò21 $100 calls a few weeks ago
when PTON was trading around $120, before the safety issues and video involving the toddler being pulled under the Peloton tread mill surfaced, John Najarian announced on CNBC‚Äôs Fast Money the day the trade was executed. THEY KNEW!"
2021-05-06 00:52:12,stocks,"Post pandemic I just don‚Äôt see people paying the equivalent of a gym membership for one machine and some virtual classes. Maybe I‚Äôm missing something but I bought a mountain bike and don‚Äôt need to pay monthly to get out and have fun while being healthy.  

Is there anything more besides an expensive exercise bike you pay a membership fee for after paying for the equipment?"
2021-05-06 06:27:12,stocks,"Lol, they really put up a fight at first."
2021-05-06 06:36:38,stocks,"so 2,000 per unit x 100,000 units = 2B. Ouch. That said, half the people who own pelotons may not have young children and may not give a flying fuck anyway, so ... maybe a 20% stock price drop is a little bit overblown. iono"
2021-05-06 08:25:34,stocks,pton puts all day ladies and gents
2021-05-06 08:37:32,stocks,"Everyone who saw the vid of their treadmill eating that kid, would be foolish to not see the downward potential it offered. I'm only sad that I couldn't buy knock-out derivatives for that shitsgow of a company."
2021-05-06 09:31:56,stocks,Data breach story is adding to negativity. Two bad stories in a row in an overvalued market. I‚Äôm following but waiting further. If another shoe drops look for a 52 week low.
2021-05-06 09:40:29,stocks,Affirm is falling with them. That's a good example why having a huge part of your revenue coming from a single customer is risky.
2021-05-05 22:34:13,stocks,"> The software improvements will automatically lock the Tread+ after use and require a four-digit passcode to unlock it, the commission said.

In other words they won't be adding anything to prevent kids and items from getting sucked under or any kind of sensor to detect that if it happens.

It's not worthless, but I'm not convinced it's a proper fix either."
2021-05-05 22:47:36,stocks,It is saddening that children were hurt because of their products. Their stock will never recover
2021-05-05 22:26:49,stocks,">keep Peloton products where children can't get to them

I'll just put my treadmill in the very top cupboard where I keep the cookies and edibles.  It's a fucken treadmill, the fact that they fought to keep them in peoples homes is fucked. I feel terrible for the family to lose a child over something stupid as a treadmill, but the realist in me just knows that there is a hoard of lawyers licking their chops and breaking down the families door for a chance at representing them, sad."
2021-05-05 22:49:50,stocks,"Clearly none of you have a wife that owns a peloton. They‚Äôre a cult. Short-term losses from the recall are coming, but the people paying a monthly subscription aren‚Äôt going anywhere, any time soon. In fact, start talking to them and watch how intensely they defend peloton. Too many people have become traders. If you have capital, this is a buy. If it continues to slide, it‚Äôs simply averaging down and holding long-term. There‚Äôs 423 thousand members in the official peloton Facebook page. Go venture over there for 5 minutes and you‚Äôll see why this company doesn‚Äôt lose steam when gyms open up."
2021-05-05 22:16:36,stocks,Ya with a put
2021-05-05 23:12:13,stocks,Going all in tomorrow! This is a mid 150 stock at least.
2021-05-06 09:34:41,stocks,No imma puts
2021-05-06 10:56:42,stocks,"They are down 43% in the last 3 months, it‚Äôs been a dip if you‚Äôre going long."
2021-05-06 00:03:09,stocks,"I wanted to get in at $108 when it was $120. It then dropped to $80 and now I want to get in at $40.  Once it hits $40 I'll look for $20, once it hits $20 I won't want it anymore because it'll be a shitty stock. Once it goes to like $200 again I'll probably end up going all in, watch it go down to $5 and sell before it goes to $1."
2021-05-05 22:43:07,stocks,this is the catalyst excuse people need to send this stock back to $40
2021-05-06 01:53:54,stocks,Executives selling since about 40 so I reckon that‚Äôs the floor
2021-05-06 08:40:40,stocks,"Why would you though? That's like Tesla loosing all their products including a viral video of one of their cars trying to murder a child.

This is not the only company producing overpriced treadmills and now they've lost everything that made them money. Unless you believe that they have some genius treadmillgineers, I see no reason to invest in that company."
2021-05-06 01:17:48,stocks,"The calculation is based on the assumption that all people paid the full price at once, which I doubt. Just from checking the peloton sub most people seem to be paying monthly instalments."
2021-05-06 00:20:24,stocks,"Massive over simplification though. I'd bet majority of tread owners keep their treads, it is an optional recall."
2021-05-05 20:22:14,stocks,Also it just finished forming a massive head and shoulders pattern and seems to be breaking to the downside. Look at 4h chart
2021-05-06 00:20:05,stocks,"Peloton is already priced for an insane amount of growth. They arnt in a position to take a quarterly hit and then just carry on with mediocre growth. They need to grow aggressively off of viral marketing like they have been. I mean even after this dip they have a P/E ratio of 165. There is no margin of safety here, they have a ton of room to fall. Especially if they lower guidance due to this on their next earnings report."
2021-05-05 22:48:46,stocks,you love buying layered dips?
2021-05-06 02:06:53,stocks,It was $38 this time last year. We‚Äôre you sperm in the .com bubble?
2021-05-06 00:03:19,stocks,I‚Äôve been on Reddit too long that I honestly can‚Äôt tell what comments are sarcasm anymore.  You‚Äôre saying Cathy‚Äôs picks haven‚Äôt been looking good recently right?  The eye roll comment threw me off
2021-05-06 11:13:42,stocks,"Cathie did exceptionally well from March 2020 to now, and that track record gave her a lot of media buzz and fame, which honestly I think she's letting a lot of get to her head as of late. I really do.  It just shows with this recent doubling, tripling, quadrupling down into picks that are getting blasted recently (mainly growth stocks), that don't really have great reasons to continue ballooning with the rates going back up"
2021-05-06 00:54:19,stocks,Wow. WSB actually kinda smart for once. Peleton is an absolute dogshit company. Their products are the absolute cheapest. They have so many issues and cut so many corners yet cost so much.
2021-05-06 00:40:13,stocks,Ok Barbara
2021-05-05 20:09:26,stocks,Roll it
2021-05-06 06:40:18,stocks,"It will be a tough 1 to 2 Years.  The company will have to regain the trust of the public.  They need to create a new product, maybe a rowing machine.  Their end goal should be to create boutique gyms (not sure if they have done this)"
2021-05-06 02:30:01,stocks,"People want it to be apple and Netflix. Expensive hardware AND subscriptions. But a fad is a fad. Even if the company grows, but not at a meme level, it‚Äôs boned stock wise."
2021-05-05 21:05:38,stocks,"They have earnings call tomorrow. 
Paying back every single bike ouch"
2021-05-06 00:04:53,stocks,"Bikes weren‚Äôt recalled, only treadmills which I think is about 2% of revenue"
2021-05-06 05:26:30,stocks,If it's anything like... was it BABA? A reasonable settlement could cause the price to run up. People overestimate damage sometimes.
2021-05-06 01:19:32,stocks,"Yes, the bike is useless without the subscription. So you will continue to pay it no matter what because otherwise it‚Äôs a $2000 clothes rack"
2021-05-06 11:56:22,stocks,200m\*
2021-05-05 20:06:30,stocks,The have the recall and then there are lawsuits.... for the stockholders who lost money when it dropped due to the handling of this issue AND the lawsuits from owners who had injuries and that family that lost a small child.  Really tough for them to move through this over the next year.   I still own shares and have been selling calls against them to lower my cost basis.
2021-05-06 00:07:58,stocks,You realize it is an optional recall. Im betting vast majority dont participate in the recall
2021-05-05 23:07:05,stocks,What‚Äôs a wife?
2021-05-06 11:23:33,stocks,"Definitely this \^\^

The product itself is extremely well-made, but obviously pricey.  It's kind of a status symbol for many people, much like the iphone was/is.  PTON is obviously not apple, but  they make a really nice product."
2021-05-05 22:32:13,stocks,"It's a treadmill, where are you going to put it?!?! The child was 6 years old! The people saying that obviously don't have kids but at 6 years old, a child is mature enough to have free roam across the house. They've been taught the dangers that are around the house and obvious things like knives and power tools are locked up by any responsible parent. However, a treadmill???? You're telling me my kids can't go inside the garage to grab their ball or bike because the treadmill is in there?? The fuck outta here, this was incredibly irresponsible of the company."
2021-05-05 23:06:56,stocks,"!Remindme 7 days
""It's $81.20 after market so it's still falling pretty hard, definitely see it going near $65 and trade sideways for a bit. Just be a little patient bro buy the recovery next week. A recall is highly unlikely to be detrimental to a company long term? Especially if treadmills also represent like 2% of their customer base. Note to self - put your psth gains in there if that pops next week"""
2021-05-06 00:58:52,stocks,But once it becomes a penny stock Leo and martin are gonna make a movie about it
2021-05-06 12:01:31,stocks,This sub in a nutshell. Make this man (or woman) a mod!
2021-05-05 21:33:01,stocks,"I have a peloton & to me, its biggest benefit is time savings more than anything. I don‚Äôt think that will change for many user even once gyms open back up. 

A 30 min class takes 31 mins to complete vs the 15 min rides to & from the gym, then the 30 min class."
2021-05-05 20:15:19,stocks,"Peloton seems pretty sticky.

If you've bought yourself a $3000 bike/treadmill whose value proposition is integrated video lessons, you would feel sunk cost fallacy not using it a couple of times a month and paying for their membership. 

If most of what you do is cardio + yoga or calisthenics, I could see someone being swayed to just sticking with Peloton due to the sunk cost instead of paying for a gym membership."
2021-05-05 20:23:00,stocks,Once gyms are opened up more people will end up going that way and I imagine peloton begins collecting dust / people work out outside with the warmer weather
2021-05-05 20:08:45,stocks,Like buying stock in Nordic track or bow flex.
2021-05-06 15:58:25,stocks,I feel like this company did so well selling basic treadmills to kale eaters that they can get out of this one. Everyone loves the Peloton name for some reason
2021-05-06 00:22:04,stocks,Yea it is painfully clear most in this thread have never used peloton products before.  No one will be returning shit lol
2021-05-06 18:56:45,stocks,"Wait do you have kids? This is the craziest comment to me. I'd return it immediately after seeing someone elses kid die because of it... I don't care if it's a hassle, I'm not taking that risk."
2021-05-05 22:47:27,stocks,"If you don‚Äôt get it replaced, your future resell value will be non existent.  Additionally, if a visitor, child, baby sitter, etc is injured and your insurance company finds out you ignored a safety recall, guess who won‚Äôt be protected..."
2021-05-06 06:31:26,stocks,"This is really amateur balance sheet understanding, esp. since you aren't talking about them reselling. Cost to create has absolutely nothing to do with anything here.

If someone returns their Tread, peloton will pay out $4k for it. And that will stay on their balance sheets until they can start reselling them.

They may recoup some of that at a later date when they start reselling the recalled items (probably not at 4k that they probably will be sold as reconditioned), but that is still going to be -$4k on their balance sheets per recalled Tread until that happens, and that factors in neither the return shipping, labour for breaking it down and boxing it up, nor the storage of these."
2021-05-06 01:56:04,stocks,It‚Äôs like a free rental
2021-05-05 22:14:35,stocks,Agreed and with vaccines coming out...we will see less indoor working out.
2021-05-06 01:16:46,stocks,I don‚Äôt think a lot people pay the full price at once. Most pay in monthly installments and together with the video instructions it‚Äôs like a gym membership.

2021-05-05 22:11:53,stocks,"Because it‚Äôs a premium brand, and this is how you build brand value with discerning customers. People who buy Volvos won‚Äôt buy this if they don‚Äôt do it. That‚Äôs a lot of wealthy people."
2021-05-06 00:36:27,stocks,It is hands down the best treadmill I have ever used.  I would have to find a replacement.  There is no way it is more dangerous than any other one I have been on.  I will be keeping mine.
2021-05-05 20:35:03,stocks,Because it doesn‚Äôt have a 24x sales‚Ä¶
2021-05-05 21:13:24,stocks,It's all about the brand my guy. Peloton has a very high net promoter score.
2021-05-05 22:23:49,stocks,The treadmill is beyond awesome.  I have had one since the Fall and love it.  It is the best treadmill I have ever been on. and the way it is built it feels really good to my knees.  On top of the content and classes are very good.  It has been a lifesaver during the pandemic and they keep creating more content for users to engage us.  I keep mine in a separate room and no pets allowed in there.  My kids are teens so it is not a danger to anyone here thank goodness.  I feel for the people who had kids or pets injured...and the kid who died.  It does not get worse than that.   I hope they find a fix for the tread so it is safe for everyone.
2021-05-06 15:51:06,stocks,can you ascertain my age based on my username
2021-05-06 02:25:05,stocks,Zero likes on my pton $50 post two months ago. Should have believed in myself more but got a little gunshy.
2021-05-05 20:14:46,stocks,"Well 1st of all, because their margins are negative. This is not a typical company where they are spending most of their money to develop scale. Thats why those are negative early on. PTONs spending is mostly on marketing. Their hardware, like any hardware, doesnt scale well because it requires 1 per customer unlike software which is 1 for everyone on the planet or opening new restaurant units which is 1 for several thousand customers. The only thing they have that scales is their software but....

The other problem is the fitness sector is notorious for client turnover so their memberships are likely not sustainable. And its not like gyms are going to want their memberships so no enterprise exposure either which is really the only reliable rev stream in that sector.

End of the day, they need to show some profit so we can estimate what their earnings will look like down the line. Can they even turn a profit at all using their current strategy? Are they like Walmart with an overall 2% margin when everything is said and done? Will it be 5%? 10%? Dont think it can ever be more than 10% and if you assume that, then you are still looking at 122 P/S.... even if you doubled that its 61 and doubled again its 30. The odds of this happening are practically 0% and the odds of 10% margin are equally unlikely given their model. Ill say 5% is more realistic and growth will obviously slow sooner than later. I think this stock is looking ahead almost 10 years..."
2021-05-05 23:21:47,stocks,My grandmothers Sears vibrating belt machine still works great!
2021-05-05 21:01:18,stocks,"Yeah, that‚Äôs the plan. It‚Äôs 5/21 expiry so maybe it will be ok by then."
2021-05-06 07:39:41,stocks,"i question how much trust they will lose, though."
2021-05-06 01:13:34,stocks,"Don't kid yourself...the recalls on ALL and I mean ALL of that junk..is nothing to sneeze about. I'm glad you like you're bike, but Peleton's claim to fame was pandemic oriented with gyms being closed..Really? Peleton forever...never ending....lol"
2021-05-06 01:15:44,stocks,Peleton is funny
2021-05-06 01:14:23,stocks,Don't be silly
2021-05-06 13:53:37,stocks,wooops mah bad.
2021-05-05 21:13:31,stocks,"It will be tough, but that will all be priced into the stock in a few weeks. I wouldn't buy today, but I would absolutely buy when the bad news stops coming and the media cycle moves on."
2021-05-06 03:41:23,stocks,Makes no sense why share holders will sue but I guess lawyers gotta make money too
2021-05-05 23:34:17,stocks,Most treadmills come with a safety key that will not operate without it.
2021-05-06 02:40:58,stocks,"You bring home a Peloton+, a large machine with a rotating belt that moves at fast speeds. Why let your child have access to that?

I thought it was the exact opposite.  Strict liability means you do not have to prove intent or knowledge.   At least as it pertains to statutory rape, strict liability means the prosecution does not have to prove the rapist knew the victim was underage.  All they have to prove is the rapist had sex with a minor."

looks TTM \~ $166m/$2,854m = \~5.6%

Which is about what I predicted... The last quarter was indeed about 5.9% too. Looks like costs are increasing to get new sales. My guess is its harder to get customers now since the enthusiasts already bought. New customers are likely harder sales thus increasing costs.

At that rate you are looking forward about 8-10 years for fair valuation. They need to push margins up to 10% for things to look better. They did do it in Q2 2020 so maybe its possible but its hard to say based on the last Q. Going forward we know the next quarter will be a disaster. We will see."

2021-05-06 06:33:51,stocks,">*You're projecting now.*

I am not; this is my area of practice and has been for the majority of my career.

&#x200B;

>*My grasp of the law*

You appear to lack this. Your argument is legally incoherent and demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of: product liability, 'strict liability', and the practical implications thereof.

&#x200B;

>***Under strict liability theory, one  has to show Peloton was knowingly at fault*** *in their design or operation  (like if Peloton didn't put warnings in the owner's manual or stickers  on the product).*  
>  
>*That's a high bar to hurdle because lacking evidence,* ***one cannot testify to another person's intent.***

I am not going to waste my time teaching you the intricacies of product liability. Suffice to say; strict product liability allows for liability to be imposed on the respondent without the finding of fault.

On this basis, contrary to your over-confident claims above, it does not need to be proven that Peloton *""was knowingly at fault""* nor is their *""intent""* pertinent in terms of establishing liability in a strict product liability claim.

See *Codling v Paglia* for insight into the practical application of Strict Product Liability in NY law.

&#x200B;

>*what someone* \[the claimant\] *needs to prove is does the product have an* ***unreasonably*** *dangerous defect?*

In the simplest terms, in product liability claims the claimant has to prove the existence of a defect and causation - i.e. a) that the product supplied is defective; and, b) that the defect caused harm.

The defect can be any number of things, broadly categorised as Manufacturing, Design, and Marketing defects - in this case it appears that there *may* be a design defect and/or a marketing defect. The 'harm' component essentially means: was the claimant injured as a result of the defect, and resultant of that injury did the claimant sustain damages?

You are, however, somewhat correct in that 'reasonableness' may be a factor in any future litigation here - although I suspect this is inadvertent on your part.

Strict liability =/= absolute liability and in a claim of a design defect the *Voss risk/utility test* applies - this places a burden on the claimant to prove the design was not reasonably safe and that it was feasible to design the product in a safer manner. Given that the design of numerous competitor products *appear* to carry far less risk of the harm suffered here I suspect this burden represents little obstacle to future claimants.

Additionally, 'reasonableness' and 'foreseeability' are factors in claims under negligence.

There are three main routes for a product liability claim:

1. Negligence,
2. Strict Product Liability; and,
3. Breach of Warranty.

Your assertion that *""under strict liability theory, one  has to show Peloton was knowingly at fault""* and comments on 'intent' and 'reasonableness' indicate to me that you are getting confused between 1. and 2. Likely because you lack the *""grasp of the law""* you claim above.

If you want to be a lawyer, go sit the bar.

In the interim, I refer you to my prior advice:

>I‚Äôd suggest you do some self-reflection and stick to topics you are more  familiar with moving forwards. If you are going to insist on being a know-all you should at least understand the subject matter."
2021-05-06 08:09:18,stocks,"Dude, you got taken to task by a lawyer about an hour ago or so. If you're posting facts and truths why not correct the lawyer's arguments about the components of strict liability and product liability."

2. Five types of shares, the one available to the public has no rights and is grossly less valuable than the other four.
3. The CEO and management are here to pander to the private equity holders, not to the common stockholder. They raise slightly below 2B privately, in order to raise $500m publicly within a short window. The 2B private buyers are immediately given at least a 50% return in one day on launch. This is an undeniable conflict of interest between management and public investors. They have not given a single comment on this dynamic.
4. As it stands, the common share which you and I are able to buy only serves as a ""dumping"" mechanism for private holders. Over time I expect this to change, but the dynamic right now is super top-loaded
5. UFC is heavily declining and they cherry-pick statistics to forge an argument to the contrary. Peaked years ago and they have no star power to carry them forward. Conner's return will be a short-lived boost to momentum, but he has peaked and nobody looks to be able to fill his shoes. He has been their all-time highest value star. Without him they are heavily damaged, and he is on his way out.
6. Talent/representation is declining HEAVILY. (50% of their business)
7. All of their businesses peaked a decade ago, growth is stagnant and this IPO/listing is to provide an exit to private investors, not to provide value to the public.

Thesis: Their entire business is declining. The ONLY benefit is that Elon is on the board. This gives them some unwarranted spotlight which I want to suggest has nothing to do with the business itself.

Honestly, that's probably been unhealthy for small/mid-cap growth tech to boot as well. The resilience from the Dow and frankly the S&P too (with it only going to -5% from an ATH and doing it just intraday between mid-February and early March) may be only prolonging the corrective action there."

2021-05-06 02:02:01,stocks,"Sup! Some advice needed please!

Short version: I need to liquidate my portfolio to purchase real estate. Do I just set all my stocks to sell at market open? What‚Äôs the best strategy? 

An answer to that would be greatly appreciated! If you want to know the reason why I‚Äôm liquidating and potentially offer other advice, read on! 

Long version: Hello everyone! Some advice needed... making some big moves and I want to make sure I handle everything properly under good practice.

First, my plan:

Step 1: Purchase rental studio apt in Waikiki with my brother. Paying in cash. Offer accepted yesterday.

Step 2: Purchase my own home within 6 months to a year. This would be financed.

Issue: I have cash sitting aside already for my personal home purchase which I have been planning for, but money I have for the rental is tied up in stocks. Those stocks are down overall. Some are up, but I‚Äôm mostly down. Also, all stocks have been owned under a year. Since I‚Äôm down, I don‚Äôt have to worry about any gains taxes right? Even though some stocks are up?

Question: I could theoretically use the cash sitting aside for my personal home purchase (this home purchase is very important to me) to cover my half of the Waikiki apt, but obviously the safer thing to do is to liquidate my portfolio right away so I don‚Äôt put my home purchase at risk, right? I‚Äôm in a bunch of tech, so I could see things rebounding soon or continuing to tank.

Follow up: if the right move is indeed to liquidate right away, do you agree I should just market sell all my positions at open tomorrow before the blood bath continues?

2021-05-05 20:48:07,stocks,"Yes I understand it‚Äôs quite depressing seeing your portfolio dropping 2-3% everyday. My portfolio has dropped 15% since February high but it‚Äôs still overall up 35% since I began April 2020. It‚Äôs still way better than the .05% the bank can offer. Think about long term. Retails pulling out from market is something those hedge fund managers want to see so they can buy low enough for future gains. It‚Äôs brutal I know but the way that everybody feels bearish and wishes to withdraw from market is almost the time markets going to shoot up again, despite the fact that we are unsure of how inflation and monetary policies go in the future. Make sure what you have are decent companies with great profit earning abilities in the future and diversify and hold. No need to dwell on everyday‚Äôs gains and loss. Stock can‚Äôt go up forever like December and January but also can‚Äôt go down forever. Hang in there and think long term as long as you don‚Äôt need the money for immediate use, my friend."

It's evident that Robinhood is dependent on Citadel for profit, so Robinhood pumps Doge for Citadel to gain more funds as they continue to be bled dry in their current shorting position of GME.  


Edit: Also look at the date when Doge first began to rise in price and compare it to when the January squeeze occurred, both are on the 28th of Jan."

2. Don't Use RH. 
3. Can't really answer this question, we don't know where you live, in the U.S. Realized gains are taxed as regular income, so, take what you make at your 9-5, add your realized gains, tax it accordingly. Unrealized gains are taxed at a lower rate."

We‚Äôre hitting all time highs right now that are completely unsustainable, if this house of cards comes down as it‚Äôs bound to sooner or later, then will see a recession like 2008. The alternative is a sideways market with small ups and downs until the real valuations catch up to stock prices.

As a result you‚Äôll benefit from the following:

2021-05-05 20:20:51,stocks,"I‚Äôm not on a variable, and in Canada, variable rate mortgages still exist. 

In Canada, you do mortgages in terms. So if you are planning a 25 year mortgage, you‚Äôll have at least 5 terms of you just make your payments and nothing else. So I‚Äôve locked in my interest rate for 5 years last year. At the end of that 5 years, I meet with my financial institution of choice, negotiate new terms, which can between 1 and 5 years, whether the term will be fixed rate or variable rate, payment schedule, all that jazz. So in my case, 200k is close enough to what I owe for the sake of the example. I have 20 years left on my mortgage, I owe that much, and I come into enough money to pay it off. I can A) pay off the mortgage and be done with it or B) I can invest that money elsewhere. 

In my case, my interest rate is roughly around 2.10% until 2024. So I would choose to invest the money because I‚Äôm slowly paying off the mortgage every two weeks, and therefore that 2.10% APR is going to come from a ever shrinking mortgage. So in just yearly amounts, let‚Äôs start at 200k, I‚Äôm roughly paying 13000 a year, minus the interest, and I‚Äôm shaving about 10000k off the first year and a little bit more each year after. During that time I invest 200k in a fund that has annualized average returns of about 5%. So that goes 210k, 220.5k, 231.5k, 243k, and 255k at the end of the term. So I pay less interest on my loan than interest I made in investments. And let‚Äôs say that at the end of the mortgage you have roughly 150k remaining, if you decided to pay it out, you now have 100k remaining in cash. 

In Canada, the interest rates have been low long enough that nobody on a mortgage should be looking at paying it off if you end up with a lump sum that could cover the whole thing. So long as it‚Äôs lower than a reasonable expectation of ROI, you just continue to make the payments. There may come a time where it will makes sense to just pay it off, but that won‚Äôt be the case until interest rates go up again."

housing prices will cool off when supply issues and this covid clusterfuck resolve, along with increased interest rates, etc.

also, real estate isn't a short term one year hold where you admire your paper profits.

FOMO'ing into real estate right now is not a good play.

dumbass buyers are outbidding themselves and paying way over asking just to get a house.

2021-05-06 01:55:05,stocks,"Well, to sum up months and months of DD done by others. We‚Äôve found out through a few different means that a few bad actors had shorted GameStop using something called a naked short, they‚Äôve shorted more shares than simply *exist* so when they get margin called due to a slew of new rules and regs coming through, they will have to cover their shorts creating the largest short squeeze in history and maybe the last with the new rules. When they have to cover they will have to buy every single share on the market and then some. Instantly buying up as many shares as the system can manage before getting halted due to volatility. This will likely continue until there‚Äôs literally no shares left on the open market. (You‚Äôre already seeing liquidity dry up in some markets due to no shares available) people will be literally able to put whatever price they want to sell their shares for and the system will automatically purchase the shares to cover shorts thus the infinite losses you see when you‚Äôre selling calls or buying puts.

But please don‚Äôt take my word for it. Check out all the god tier DD on r/superstonk"

2021-05-06 02:35:56,stocks,"So the thing is - you‚Äôre right in the general case. 

Except in our specific area - we are on the outskirts of a big city where prices are still reasonable. We‚Äôre kind of in the ‚Äúboonies‚Äù other than being in the city limits. 

The hypothetical $180k would buy half of a very large, nice house. We‚Äôd finance the rest with really fucking cheap money. We‚Äôd then immediately rent that house out and not only pay it‚Äôs mortgage, but a solid chunk of our own as well (which is definitely doable on the current rent prices - considering we‚Äôre considering doing this currently even without the $180k) 

Rent prices may go down due to less demand, but they are also going to go up based on our location. Realistically, they just need to stay above the point where the house is paying for itself, as we tuck away equity."

2021-05-05 21:00:49,stocks,"[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul\_Volcker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Volcker)

>Inflation emerged as an economic and political challenge in the United States during the 1970s. The [monetary policies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy) of the Federal Reserve board, led by Volcker, were widely credited with curbing the rate of [inflation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation) and expectations that inflation would continue. US inflation, which peaked at 14.8 percent in March 1980, fell below 3 percent by 1983.[\[22\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Volcker#cite_note-22)[\[23\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Volcker#cite_note-23) The Federal Reserve board led by Volcker raised the [federal funds rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_funds_rate), which had averaged 11.2% in 1979, to a peak of 20% in June 1981. The [prime rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_rate) rose to 21.5% in 1981 as well, which helped lead to the [1980‚Äì1982 recession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_1980s_recession_in_the_United_States),[\[24\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Volcker#cite_note-24) in which the national [unemployment rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment_in_the_United_States) rose to over 10%. Volcker's Federal Reserve board elicited the strongest political attacks and most widespread protests in the history of the Federal Reserve (unlike any protests experienced since 1922), due to the effects of high interest rates on the construction, farming, and industrial sectors, culminating in indebted farmers driving their tractors onto C Street NW in [Washington, D.C.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.) and blockading the [Eccles Building](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eccles_Building). 

I think Volcker's reputation rebounded after all was said and done. If something needs to be done, someone will step up to the plate."

2021-05-05 21:08:56,stocks,"Mortgage REITs only have paper assets. They dont own any actual real estate assets. They buy the mortgages for real estate usually by borrowing short term (2 year loans) and lending long term (10 year loans). By regulation, they are allowed to borrow 8x-12x their equity to buy real estate depending on how the feds feel that day. And yes if the feds reduce the multiplier, they can get margin calls and be forced to sell loans at a discount.

In theory a 2 year loan is lower interest than a long term 10 year loan. The margin between these two loans is how they make money. Its still very risky due to high sensitivity to treasury interest rates. Also, what happens if a loan is defaulted and the person doesnt pay their debt?

Many mREITs hedge in various ways against defaulting payers but the exposure is always a risk. Some mREIT's only buy ""agency"" loans. These are government back loans like FHA where the government guarantees the loan even if the payer defaults. These are companies like NLY or AGNC. There is, obviously, less profit in this but less risk too. Note this does not eliminate the interest rate risk, just the loss of monthly payments from the lendee risk. They can still get margin calls if their equity falls below federal requirements. So dont assume its all roses. They are still incredible sensitive to interest rates.

But non-agency mREITs dont have this type of protection and you have to be very diligent to find out what loans they own. These guys got hammered and many went under in the financial crash. Many have been shrinking for years too due to weakness in commercial property."
2021-05-05 22:01:45,stocks,"Their GM chart is pretty damning. Down slope since the 90s with hiccups around the .com boom/bust. Dont recall why. Probably some sort of buyout or something. Then some flatness between 2005-2011 but then back to decline. It was high as 70% back in the mid 90s.

T-mobile has actually seen its margins growing the last decade. VZ, as stated prior, has managed to stay flat.

If you use normalized income on T, it makes things look a little better but I dont trust it. One time expenses are still expenses and depreciation for a telecom is a real thing. Its mostly equipment which really does have to be replaced often. Its not like a REIT. But I havent dug that deep into these so ill give it the benefit of the doubt. But the GM is still pretty bad."
2021-05-06 08:27:11,stocks,Wow thank you  for your time  and writing this up
2021-05-06 10:06:16,stocks,"OK. There's no question that looking at things over a substantial period such as 20 years is important. But ultimately, this comes down to risk/reward.

AT&T is clearly not a terrific business, it does not have the growth, margins, balance sheet, or management of e.g. Facebook (which is trading at a > 4% earnings yield ex-cash). If it was, we wouldn't see a 6.5% dividend yield from a C-corp in this market.

However, IMHO, at $30, the downside is acceptable and well understood to me (this conversation that we've had here trying to pin down the bear case speaks for that).

I think that where out views differ significantly is that I see upside optionality in HBO/Warner. Given AT&T's record of poor management, it's completely possible that they will screw that one up too, but we'll see. To an extent, AT&T is a good example of Buffett's ""invest in businesses that are so wonderful that an idiot can run them - because sooner or later, one will""."

2021-05-06 10:54:08,stocks,"Not completely true. When they buy companies, they need to over pay on valuations.

2021-05-06 08:34:09,stocks,"You should get a control number when a proxy vote is scheduled.

If your shares are electronic they likely have no unique identifier. Many (most?) are held ""in street name"", meaning your broker is the name registered with the clearing corporation, and you are a ledger entry in your broker's larger holding of the shares.

In reality, the shares never leave the clearing corporation, and the broker's holding is a ledger entry in their accounts. This makes share settlement a simple debit and credit in their books. The flow of cash still takes time.

When you request paper certificates each one gets a serial number and the broker no longer carries those shares on its ledger. The number will be registered with the company's IR, but they (should) assign your holding a new control number for each proxy.

The DTCC is currently trying to make all paper certificates in all forms of securities go away, as they add friction and risk to the settlement system. I wouldn't be surprised if in the next couple of years you receive a notification that your paper shares have been ""dematerialized,"" with instructions how to transfer the electronic entry to your account of choice, and the paper certificate is just wall art."

2021-05-06 09:18:47,stocks,">Well you already do that. The roads you drive on the police and military and fire departments that keep you safe, the schools and libraries that educate you are all the product of the entire society taking care of themselves. Leading to in the end a better life for everybody. 

Roads, police, and the fire department are public goods so it makes sense for the government to run them. Healthcare and education are not so they should be privatized. 

>Well its not arbitrary. Its what we as a society agreed to is a good value with a good enough work life balance. Its also not coincidentally close to the average value where working more hours gives diminishing returns for the average person.

Society agreeing on it makes it arbitrary. If someone has to work more than 40 hours per week to survive they should work more than 40 hours per week. It's not my job to subsidize other people's lack of skills with my taxes. 

>Yes, but that's because they don't need one as everybody can get by on the market rate. Something that's definitely not the case in the USA.


Nobody is starving to death in the US so clearly people are getting by. Also, almost nobody makes minimum wage. Something like 1.5-2% of people actually make minimum wage. If a grown adult still making minimum wage, they're a fuck up and it's their fault. Also the minimum wage hurts low skill workers who it is meant to help. If someone produces $10 of value an hour, and they must be paid $15 an hour nobody will hire them. They won't be able to gain the skills to move up and you've screwed them over. 

>You should, some great lessons can be learned from looking at your peers. Both good and bad.

I look at other countries and I see poorer countries that don't innovate at all and couldn't defend themselves if Russia or China decided to invade. I see countries that are subsidized by the US military and US innovation. 

>Poor people in all western countries have smart phones and TV's. But in other western countries they also have free access to means to help them stop being poor. Like free education, healthcare, livable minimum wage etc. They are not stuck in an endless cycle of overworked and underpaid poorness like can happen in the USA.

You don't need any of those things to get out of poverty. If you do 3 simple things in America, you will not be in poverty. Finish high school, get a full time job, and don't have a kid until you're married. That is it. Do these 3 things and you have a 2% chance of living in poverty and a 75% chance of joining the middle class. Not bad odds for making three simple decisions. 

https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/three-simple-rules-poor-teens-should-follow-to-join-the-middle-class/

>Of course the stress that comes with being poor is a great burden on your mental state and general outlook on the world. And being poor is the number one indicator for crime

Existing is stressful for many people. Many people who make good money are stressed about work or their kids. We can't eliminate poverty. It's not possible. The US has spent $20T to end poverty since the 1960's and the poverty rate hasn't changed. Giving people welfare does not help them. If anything it hurts them because the government incentivizes single parent homes which is an even better indicator of crimes, drug use, and not finishing high school. 

>Yes this is the standard across the western world. But what I mean is that a poor families cannot pay for tertiary education or even need their kids to work during high school. And has a higher chance to remain poor due to that fact.

There are need based scholarships and grants for poor people, and as I mentioned earlier there is no need to go to college to not be poor. Also community college is cheap. I worked in high school and college but still graduated with $45k in loans that I'm paying off. There's a way for people who want to go to school but don't have rich parents. 

>Maybe even you cant if you get hit by a car tomorrow. And for cases like that we agreed as a society to pay for the minimal care for those people in the form of tax.

I have insurance so I would be fine financially. People should pay for their own insurance. Society shouldn't be paying for it. 

>No, my point is to let the rich people pay for it. You are not rich. If you are, call me. My company builds super yachts that you might be interested in. They start at 300.000.000$

Only the rich pay taxes. The top 20% pays 87% of the income taxes. I don't think it's moral to steal from someone just because they're rich. I don't care if you vote for it. People's rights aren't up for a vote. Their right to property is just as important as a poor person's. Tax the poor the poor don't pay their fair share. 

>Yeah and thats great that you guys want to help other people lead better lives as well. But it baffles me that the easiest and cheapest ways to help the people around you are not being utilized. Mainly a worthy minimum wage and socialized healthcare.

The minimum wage hurts low skill workers and causes unemployment. Socialized healthcare is crap. It stops innovation and creates long wait times. So you not recall the prime minister of England going to hospitals apologizing because they had to delay many crucial surgeries? Sure, the American system is messed up, but it's because of heavy government intervention in the market. 

>But there are effective ways to fight poverty. Just look at other countries and steal their best ideas. (Like increasing minimum wage and tax on rich people).

Other countries have poverty too. Ending poverty is not a problem for the government to solve. It's a problem for people in poverty to solve. The government cannot save you from yourself. Also America has the most progressive tax system in the world. Which is why we must tax the poor because they don't pay shit.

I find it amusing how you care about people so much you want to help them with other people's money lol."

2021-05-06 03:55:35,stocks,Thanks for the great insight here. Just a comment about your last point though.. Inflation is tougher to face for younger generations who only have loads of student debt and are not yet homeowners. Housing prices are incredibly high now and are creating a massive barrier to entry. This will have a bad effect if it persists and people can only acquire real estate via inheritance for a whole generation. I'm hoping I'm wrong about that
2021-05-06 13:26:34,stocks,"You're very right, and something needs to be done about it, but I don't know what. Single sector inflation, especially what we're seeing in housing, is tough because it doesn't flow from the bottom up and affect wages. It needs to be fixed but not by raising rates, as that would affect everything else too. The supply chain has to catch up. As long as the inflation stays isolated to individual sectors and isn't affecting the price of bread, I don't expect the Fed to back down too much."

2021-05-06 00:56:06,stocks,"What is considered short term? They just destroyed projections in the short term based on their most recent earnings. Intel isn‚Äôt catching up to them on the processor side for the next two years minimum. The 12th gen desktop CPUs are trash from the benchmarks I‚Äôve seen. Comparatively, the Zen 4 chips are supposedly monsters‚Äîoffering 20% gains on the zen 3 processors that are already monsters. The only concern would be supply meeting the increased demand, but even that needs context. If last year I could only produce and sell 10 apples, but this year I increased production to 20 apples (which also sold out), does it matter that 10 other people wanted to buy apples from me and couldn‚Äôt? In Econ, that‚Äôs a good problem to have. It means your products are underpriced relative to the value they offer to consumers. Either AMD will raise prices in the meantime to stabilize supply and maximize profits, or increase supply from TMSC. You‚Äôd have to be an idiot as an investor to think the ‚Äúchip shortage‚Äù is a long term problem for AMD when they are steadily taking away market share from Intel and Nvidia."

But if you look at the medians, you see they big gains are from a vanishingly small number of picks, and if you happened to miss those, you didn't do even remotely as well. Tom and David's 20-year averages are both good but their medians trail the S&P by quite a bit. For a good time , look at their picks since 2009, then strike just the top 2 individual monthly picks in that entire period and see what the average return drops to. You can do something similar with their top 5 picks in the last 20 years. I wasn't impressed."
