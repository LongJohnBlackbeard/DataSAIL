03/23/2021,stocks,Intel has to step up plain and simple.
03/23/2021,stocks,100% agree with you. I think both companies have amazing upsides in the future especially as AI becomes more common and advanced.
03/23/2021,stocks,"I would say AMD is a buy, but not INTC. The stock has run a bit hot and I would wait for a pullback/correction.  Especially considering you are at ATH levels currently. In terms of upside I think AMD has more upside."
03/23/2021,stocks,Lol look at intel new news moon shot may be coming plus with the chip shortage
03/23/2021,stocks,I would say Pat is the start of that change! Only been CEO a month but already there is more enthusiasm for Intel than there's been in a while
03/23/2021,stocks,Intel is still at a 12 P/E ratio tho! I think supply eases up and there are lots of units sold second half of this year
03/23/2021,stocks,Yea Pat is a great CEO and this turnaround should only gain steam as one of the few bargain the semiconductor industry
03/23/2021,stocks,"Fair point. I’ll counter it with this: a lot of their recent success imo has been because of the shortage, since they were one of the few chipmakers that had inventory (thanks to their 7nm slip up). So if supply eases up for everybody whats stopping consumers and companies from going back to their technologically superior competitors?"
03/23/2021,stocks,With the new administration look at the chip shortage should add fuel to them in the new infrastructure bill that may come
03/23/2021,stocks,Absolutely agree
03/23/2021,stocks,"I think all types of chips are in shortage, not just bleeding edge high margin ones. In fact, I think AMD and Intel can both have huge success within similar spaces. But I am very interested to see how it shakes our shorter term, AMD should be able to maintain their advantage for 2-3 years which is the soonest Pat could affect the end of the supply chain"
03/23/2021,stocks,"Double checking myself I see they have been affected by the shortage. But I agree I think they both can succeed, i just think the market has gone too bullish on the turnaround story before it has significant legs to stand on, and too bearish on AMD as a result."
03/23/2021,stocks,Applied Materials major winner for any bullish chip news regardless of company.
03/23/2021,stocks,"Didn't the Biden Administration say they wanted more tech built in the US to guard against relying on foreign imports; chips being one of them?

Edit: nevermind, literally says it further down the article."
03/23/2021,stocks,Intel fluff is killing my amd position.  Amd apparently does not have a PR dept.
03/23/2021,stocks,"I'm long on both TSM and INTC. 

Just because Intel is memed ""14nm++++ lolz"" by AMD fanboys doesn't mean aren't a massive player in the semi space. They also have a huge advantage through the lens of ""National Security"" in semi, with 4 US fabs. This will put them to 6 total with TSM in their Arizona ""backyard"" in 2024. Pair this with Bidens 100 day semi review and I believe its going to get super exciting over the next couple years!"
03/23/2021,stocks,Would y’all throw money at TSM or SMH?
03/23/2021,stocks,"I hope they can secure a suitable water supply.. seems it's not coming from the usual sources.

Otherwise, good news."
03/23/2021,stocks,Im buying more AMD and TSM if it continues to dip.  This is a total overreaction and Intel is years behind on technology.
03/23/2021,stocks,"Intel is also coming out with their own GPU’s soon.  Right now NVIDIA dominates that market with AMD a distant 2nd.  With the demand for GPU’s as high as it is now, Intel should be able to sell as many as they can produce."

03/23/2021,stocks,">“We will pursue customers like Apple” for Intel’s foundry business, Gelsinger said.

That's gotta be a joke, right? Please someone tell me that's a joke! Please?

Apple which moved away from Intel CPU's and now bet fully on ARM. Intel which recently made these anti Apple ads ""Go PC""?

And he believes Apple will come crawling back?"
03/23/2021,stocks,I’m in the same boat as you. If they don’t step in this ship is going to $55
03/23/2021,stocks,"same, got INTC at $19, TSM at $75. Happy with both."
03/23/2021,stocks,SHM is way more diversified and already has TSM so why not that?
03/23/2021,stocks,They’re not. Lol. Even AMD still thinks Intel is still ahead in the competition from their latest 10-K SEC Filings. CPU is just a fraction of Intel but they’re well-diversified from acquisitions.
03/23/2021,stocks,Nah
03/23/2021,stocks,"Lol, no, they’re really not. They’re struggling with the current TSM generation, but by far are not out of the game. There is room for both Intel and TSMC to produce chips."
03/23/2021,stocks,"> for Intel’s foundry

For Foundry, not CPU design."

03/23/2021,stocks,"My only thinking is if you truly believe in TSM, I would think you would get more gains directly from that long term over the ETF. The ETF would just be safer if Something happens to TSM. Still would plummet the ETF tho"
03/23/2021,stocks,Im sure they have your emails directly filed to spam by now
03/23/2021,stocks,"The stock decays at such a steep rate that the gains even in a big crash would not be as much as you might hope.

If you had done this in March 2018 AND had managed to time the bottom of the 2020 crash, you wouldn’t even double your money.  

So you put in $600 now and maybe you make a $600 profit if there’s another covid-level crash in the next two years?"
03/23/2021,stocks,"With the current ""correction"", your odds might be better putting $600 into TQQQ."

03/23/2021,stocks,Larry Merlo of CVS has a degree in Pharmacy
03/23/2021,stocks,"The CEO of MU has degrees in electrical engineering and computer science.  He also has a bunch of patents.

Edit: Forgot that the CEO of GM also has a degree in electrical engineering and went through business school on a GM fellowship."
03/23/2021,stocks,"An easy way to potentially search for this will be to hone in on ""founder-led"" companies. Founders are more likely to be specialists in that business's industry rather than just a suit brought in later on."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Heres a brief bio of the man behind the Rodgers Silicon Valley spac (RSVA), soon to become Enovix (ENVX)

Thurman J. “TJ” Rodgers co-founded Cypress Semiconductor (“Cypress”). From 1982 to 2016, Rodgers served as Cypress’s CEO for 34 years until stepping down as the longest-tenured CEO among all publically-traded technology companies. He currently serves on the boards of five other energy-related private companies: Bloom Energy, the world’s most prominent fuel cell manufacturer, Enovix Corp., a company that integrates lithium ion batteries into silicon wafers, Enphase Energy, Inc., a company that provides microinverters and solar solutions for commercial companies and residential homes, FTC Solar, a company that provides single-axis tracking for solar companies and Solaria, a company that manufactures solar panels. He is the former chairman of the Semiconductor Industry Association and of SunPower Corporation, the second-largest solar energy company in revenue worldwide. He currently holds the title Trustee Emeritus on Dartmouth’s Board of Trustees. From 2004 to 2012, he served on Dartmouth’s Board of Trustees, where he endowed two chairs at the College. He attended Stanford University on a Hertz fellowship, earning a master’s degree in 1973 and a Ph.D. in 1975, both in electrical engineering. In 1970, Rodgers graduated from Dartmouth where he was a Sloan scholar. He graduated as the Salutatorian of his class with a double major in physics and chemistry. At graduation, he won the Townsend Prize and the Haseltine Chemistry-Physics Prize as the top physics and chemistry student in his class."
03/23/2021,stocks,Hlyk is lead by a doctorpreneur.
03/23/2021,stocks,This might be creating an opportunity to buy AMD. Not saying intel isn’t going to be successful. Seems like it’s been moving up on news alone
03/23/2021,stocks,"I’m a INTC holder since mid-2020 (avg around $47 a share) although I think the company is still undervalued I would not be so sure the market will react positively to this news. Even with the chip shortage and with the government planning to ensure chips for American companies in the future I could see the stock being rocky after this news is digested. Although 20 billion (cost of new facilities) isn’t a crazy amount for a company like Intel, and many would say it’s a fantastic investment for them, keep in mind they have had a lot of troubles with manufacturing in the last 5 years which could make its future even less predictable. We will see how it pans out and I hope the market likes this play, just don’t think this will boost the stock too much higher on this alone, they will need steady improvements in chip development."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Hmmm.. no new chips hitting the market, no technology improvements, spend $20 billion on fabs with inferior tech, possible $15/hr minimum wage increasing operating expenses, AMD still continuously taking market share with consistently releasing new products, TSM still superior and already on 5nm and 3nm while Intel can’t even get 7nm right. Yet they want Apple as a customer? Why would Apple do that when their products are on 7nm and 5nm? Maybe if they had no other choice, but they have already booked their orders with TSM. And the recovery story is pretty much priced in at this point, so what else is there before 2023 that gives it the juice to continue this trajectory? I wouldn’t be surprised if Intel gives back its 2021 gains tbh."
03/23/2021,stocks,Amen brother! INTC is unstoppable atm. This investors day news is massive!
03/23/2021,stocks,"I recently grabbed INTC as it was undervalued and didn't run at all like the other semi's over the last 12 months. I bought in lite hoping to grab more if it dropped. That was over 10% ago. No regrets but it would have been nice to have the full 100 shares I was shooting for. 

They aren't as exciting as AMD and others. I get it. Doesn't mean they aren't a safe place to put your money. The growth may be limited but a continued run after 100% gains by the other semi's could be just as limited. I also don't see the downside risk in intel like I do the stocks still riding huge momentum. 

Maybe I just like owning intel for the nostalgia. I remember the old pentium commercials. I'm getting old."
03/23/2021,stocks,Could be great for AMD as well
03/23/2021,stocks,Had $INTC dumped it.. and brought $TSM best decision ever. With that said $TSM > $INTC
03/23/2021,stocks,"Yeah, I still agree AMD is a good long term investment."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Intel opening up the fabs is a HUGE opportunity. TSM is valued at 600 billion just for their fabs, intel surely can win many clients who don't necessarily need the cutting edge fab (like apple/amd/nvda). While creating new cutting edge fabs for customers, they can also open up their under utilized older tech fabs to customers like memory, auto n many more. I believe it will be well received tomorrow when market opens up"
03/23/2021,stocks,"I’m at the same price point and timeline. Also agree with your assessment. I think the market wanted intel to turn their back in manufacturing and just focus on design. This is the ballsy move (though I guess stopping manufacturing and changing business model would be also). But glad they’re not continuing status quo, time to double down on manufacturing or give it up entirely. I’m not smart or clairvoyant enough to know which direction will turn out better"
03/23/2021,stocks,"I am in at $50.00 a share, and so far in after hours its reacting positively. If it doesnt react well when the market opens who cares.I still see the long prospect of this company and I think the company has a bright future. Also 20 billion dollars is a lot but whatever you say buddy."
03/23/2021,stocks,You just keep on talking like you have been doing since INTC has been down and I will just keep on gaining 👍
03/23/2021,stocks,Lets go 💪
03/23/2021,stocks,Same man. I bought at $50.00 and really was hoping for a dip after the hype died from the CEO announcement but it just keeps running up and now its running up even more. Yeah this is definitely a time where I am wishing that I have bought more shares. But hindsight is 20/20 in the market. I am just happy I am sitting on some shares already.
03/23/2021,stocks,"Thanks for the shares, appreciate it ;)"
03/23/2021,stocks,"Completely agree, it could be a home run with the new factories helping their manufacturing issues or could be another in a long line of manufacturing mistakes. The new CEO is definitely trying to shake things up which was certainly needed. I am cautiously optimistic."
03/23/2021,stocks,I actually think Intel has some good things in the works especially when it comes to quantum computing. I’m just saying at the current moment the run up feels a bit unjustified fundamentally and from a technical basis I wouldn’t be surprised if the stock pulls back within the next month or so. What happens when the market digests the news and applies it to their financials and sees that their operating expenses are rising yet they aren’t making significant gains back in market share?
03/23/2021,stocks,The run down imo was unjustified and a lot of it was market overreaction. If it dips again I will just do what I did last time and buy the dip 👍
03/23/2021,stocks,"I would disagree. It’s definitely justified if you come out and say “hey we can’t successfully produce the latest tech and won’t be able to technologically compete with our competitors until 2023” especially as the largest chip manufacturer. That’s inexcusable and a clear blunder by the company. You could also classify this whole run up as an overreaction since it was largely based on news and no real fundamental change in intels situation other than the new CEO but that still doesn’t change their situation, they are still behind until 2023. If we are being honest the thing that’s helping Intel at the moment is the shortage. Take the shortage away and companies will buy better chips from their competitors. But again, Intel is too big to fail and they aren’t going anywhere."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Personally the price is still too high for me on a gamble. Biotech's always go through rounds of funding and fail when they reach this point.

This being their only real drug it's possible this company zeroes out. We know single dose worked. Why did multi-dose fail? Did the body figure out it's an antigen? There is so much unknown and why it's a high risk bet.

I want to see them succeed, but the cards are now stacked against them. I'll be a buyer in the low singles. Good luck!"
03/23/2021,stocks,I think this might be a great buy when it hits bottom. What a hell of a drop!
03/23/2021,stocks,[Why you can't trust the experts](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/frequency-therapeutics-inc.-freq-upgraded-to-buy%3A-what-does-it-mean-for-the-stock-2021-03)
03/23/2021,stocks,That's an automatically generated web post lol.
03/23/2021,stocks,"Theoretically yes, but the stock would have to jump that much in one trade.  Most of my limit sells/buys are filled at or very near the price.  Depends on broker as well.  Every vanguard trade I have ever made was filed at limit to the penny."
03/23/2021,stocks,A limit buy will execute if the price is lower than the limit.
03/23/2021,stocks,It should not happen in real life.   I always use limit orders and never seen anything like that.   I've had partial fills where I put in a limit to buy 50 shares at $40 and when I look at the end of the day I had bought 10 shares at $40 with the rest still open.
03/23/2021,stocks,"I've had this problem on Webull, never on ThinkOrSwim"
03/23/2021,stocks,Yeah same. I think it was just a bug but now it feels weird because my paper trading account jumped $2k+ in value and it doesn’t feel realistic because that wouldn’t usually happen normally
03/23/2021,stocks,"This isn't real money so the advice is different from the real world.

I would take as much risk as humanly possible and given how things have sold off I would position that long aggressively probably in tech. I would use as much leverage as possible and invest in very high beta/volatile stocks.

Especially ESG if your getting extra points for it - Biden is expected to release his infrastructure plan that is going to have a lot of clean energy firepower. 

Also look into see if you can buy warrants - not classified as options but have a similar effect. If theres no limit on warrants buy a ton of those."
03/23/2021,stocks,Stay away from options.  They are complicated and it will be hard to increase gains in a 2 week span with them.  I’m just learning options and unless you are savvy enough to do spreads on stocks that stay even they won’t help you.
03/23/2021,stocks,Any rules on how often you can trade a stock?  Or is it buy once and hold?  What's the timeframe for the competition?
03/23/2021,stocks,"100% agreed for real money.

But for fake money where winner is the one with the greatest amount of money -- options all the way. Either win big or lose big. You won't ""learn"" anything though -- just how to win stock market competitions..."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Wrong. With fake money on the line, go all out on options. 2 weeks is plenty of time for options."
03/23/2021,stocks,"I have about a month to broaden my understanding on the topic, do you think that's not enough to incorporate a small amount in my portfolio? (No sarcasm intended)"
03/23/2021,stocks,"Two weeks timeframe, limited to 350 trades. I think you have complete freedom in what trades you make.

Also, the more you hold a sustainable company, the higher the score for the position (e.g. 2% bonus if held for 2 days, 12% bonus if held for 8)."
03/23/2021,stocks,Even over a 2 week timeframe?
03/23/2021,stocks,For real. Use that full 10% on way otm leaps.
03/23/2021,stocks,Maybe.  I guess it depends on your financial background and how quick you pick up new ideas.  Look into option spreads.  Time decay is less of a factor over 2 weeks so that helps.
03/23/2021,stocks,"Weird.  Not sure what the ""learnings"" are supposed to be, as this encourages a non sustainable approach :)  What's the bonus if it sits in one stock for the entire two weeks? (12% bonus for 8 days is a tough return to beat by anyone hamstrung by these odd rules).  It might be worth it to throw it all in the stock with the highest bonus, and just sit there and collect the bonus.  Or same as above, but trade the 100k max allowed with calls/puts on a stock that has enough volatility to make a few bucks within a week or two.  Trade close to expiration, what have you got to lose?"
03/23/2021,stocks,"Yeah. Especially in a competition with a ton of people.

Imagine 200 people in a competition. Highest chance to win in 2 weeks is to make high volatility bets, which out of the money weeklies will get you (no matter what the stock)."
03/23/2021,stocks,"I wonder how they factor the 10% limit.  Is it at purchase price, number of shares or price at the end.  I guess that would have a big effect on how you play options.  But what you said makes perfect sense."
03/23/2021,stocks,"I don't know if I would call it YOLOing if you're doing it into index funds, as you said yourself the only real risk is if the entire market crashes, but if you have a disposable income and you continually keep investing throughout the crash then it's extremely likely that you will end up with more money than if you didn't invest at all."
03/23/2021,stocks,"I hope someone chimes in with a downside to doing this. It seems to make a lot of sense. What are the expenses on the funds?

Googled it for myself:

https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/121515/why-3x-etfs-are-riskier-you-think.asp"
03/23/2021,stocks,"You're missing a slow decay from regular stock market.

Forget a crash for a moment (probably not wise given out situation, but forget it).

You'll have to determine how many down days vs. up days you can expect and if your up days will come after you've lost so much $ on your principal that you don't recoup your losses. 

If SPX goes down 3%, you're out 6-9%. When it goes up after that, you earn a percentage of what's left, not a percentage of your initial investment.

Plus there is less instinct value to the stock. If you buy AMZN and it tanks 10%, you still have a share of AMZN - a real asset and portion of a company. You don't get that with a leveraged fund as much. $2 or $3 out of every dollar isn't an asset. 

You could easily backtest to see how well it works. BUT don't backtest in 2020/2021. 497 of the 500 companies in the S&P have been profitable. It isn't a good baseline to work with IMO.

If you have TD Ameritrade, you can use their papertrading option on Thinkorswim and load up any dates you'd like to run them and see how it works out. Really cool feature. It's free for traders on their platform. 

Might be worth running it in a year with a crash or correction to see how that plays out. Worst case scenarios are always good to have in mind when making a decision so you can imagine how bad it could be and if you're comfortable taking on that risk."
03/23/2021,stocks,r/LETFs
03/23/2021,stocks,"Yes 100% - I plan on starting a long position in TQQQ for the long term at some point when I move out of recovery names. Who cares about decay when you're getting 50%+ returns annually. If I lose it I lose it, if I don't it could be worth a fortune down the road."
03/23/2021,stocks,"I thought about this as well, the only leveraged ETFs that are old enough to have gone through a prolonged crash was the 2x ones, like SSO. Thinking from a long term perspective, if you bought the peak in 2007, instead of a 50% drawdown in the S&P after 2008 you got about an 85% drawdown at the bottom, but if you held you'd be at about a 5x since then, vs roughly 2.6x holding SPY. But if you look at SSO/SPY, it would have taken till 2016 for you to have broke even on SSO vs SPY. And you'd even have gone under SPY at the bottom of the covid cash.

So you could say maybe it was better to hold the leveraged ETF, but lets say there is a long term downturn in the next 2-3 years, and you take another 80%+ drawdown, then you would still be much better holding SPY since 2007, and it may take you 10+ years to ""break even"" compared to SPY. My conclusion was to just stick with normal index funds when stocks are high and use margin only after significant downturns.

There is also extra risk to leveraged ETFs since they're still fairly new and haven't been tested during dot com level crashes, rising / high interest, prolonged high volatility, especially the 3x ones. I think its safe to say in a big downturn you'd essentially go to zero holding 3X ETFs, but could potentially make more if you dollar cost averaged during the bottom. That would be tough psychologically though."
03/23/2021,stocks,"If you’re young I recommend putting your money into solid growth stocks, it’l give you more growth over the coming 1-5 years than putting it in indexes. I’d recommend Square, Apple, EXPI, Snap, TakeTwo, Tesla, NVidia, Microsoft."

The opposition wanted to try legalise the entire canabis ecosystem (from production to selling in shops and paying taxes) in least 30+ cities to get a decent sample size but it was reduced to 10. In a few years the experiment is over and they will take a descision on how to move forward on that data. So don't hold your breath."
03/23/2021,stocks,I think you should you should smoke some more.
03/23/2021,stocks,Dang. I kinda imagined that this would be the case. No wonder I didnt find anything...
03/23/2021,stocks,Username checks out. Also thought that this was a joke on my expense until i googled it. Hahah nice. Im defnitly going to check them out when covid is gone :D
03/23/2021,stocks,Big yikes
03/23/2021,stocks,Yeh. Really thought that could work hahaha
03/23/2021,stocks,"Yeah... Basically it was illegal for people to sell weed to the coffeeshop so they had a back door policy until recently.  Something changed with that.. I forget what exactly.  But the origin of the whole industry was underground as opposed to medicinally approved.  That being said I'm sure there's probably some kind of CBD companies in Europe.  I'd actually say you might be better off looking on the British exchange... Those guys are likely to aggressively push into Europe given a chance.
Edit: assuming there are any there too (CBD etc)"
03/23/2021,stocks,"I spent quite some time in Amsterdam on business, so had a lot of free time. My understanding is that two Americans just happened to move out to Amsterdam and decided to open up the place. It’s small, but it was very well frequented my tons of tourists as well as locals. They have photos of a lot of celebrities posted inside. I’m am sure they have quite a few more photos by now. You can thank me later... 😀👍"
03/23/2021,stocks,"It's what's known as a loss leader. FZROX and the other 2 zero fee funds were created to attract new customers so they can eventually up sell them to other products. Additionally, Fidelity doesn't have to pay any licensing fees to rent out a name so they save money on that as well."
03/23/2021,stocks,Managed assets generate money for them. They have several zero fee mutual fund indexes. They are great options for baseline taxable accounts or even a Roth.
03/23/2021,stocks,"It is NOT free, NOTHING is free:

they pay divident once a year, which means they use the divident to reinvest it themselfes for 9months of the year, so if you consider 8% anual return on the stock market, and 1.8% SP500 ETF divident on average you are loosing 3/4 of the divident return if you were to get it quaterly and reinvest it yourself.. 

if you had invested $10,000 in the Fidelity ZERO SP500 fund that would be $180 in dividents you would get ONCE a year instead quaterly so you are missing 3/4s of divident reivestment returns and that is 3/4 of 8% * $180  = $10.8

so basicly you have 0.108% expese ratio they actualy make 3x the money than VOO does

also dont forget that is not a ETF, and is ONLY traded on Fidelity

much better off buying VOO imo with 0,03% expese"
03/23/2021,stocks,"Thanks, that's what I figured. Surprised FSKAX hasn't seen a bigger exodus."
03/23/2021,stocks,"How do those assets generate for them without an expense ratio? If I’m getting the full NAV, what’s left for Fidelity? Seems like you are describing, by definition, an expense ratio.

I know they are good investments. I’m just wondering if it’s a loss leader, or not - and if not, exactly how do they profit?"
03/23/2021,stocks,"Good question. How do you profit from assets you hold? They have the advantage of scale and are able to move cash around to probably generate a minimal return. I doubt they lose money on it. An expense ratio is really a fee as it relates to a percentage of invested principal. Since there's no fees, no ""ratio"". (But I surmise you already understand this).

Maybe it is a gateway ad to get people into other popular low fee funds."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Good value, undoubtedly. But also abnormally high risk. Despite virtually every analyst having a positive rating in the stock, it continues to be held down.

I’m not sure how one could accurately account for the country and regulatory risk"
03/23/2021,stocks,"If you are easily pursuaded by the media coverage of China, owning Chinese stocks is not a good idea. The ability to withstand a lot of noise is a must."
03/23/2021,stocks,Baba in the 220s was the fastest I ever opened/built a position.. I am a long hold
03/23/2021,stocks,"Thank for your post.. I agree with you about the incredible value and potential Alibaba has. If one compares $BABA to many stocks in the sector, the only conclusion that one will arrive at  is that the stock is undervalued.  I had the company for a while but it didn't move and opted for selling and using my little money to buy another company. 

In my opinion, I believe that it has more to do with unjustifiable sentiment and not with sound reasoning.  Notice that here the minute anyone mentions China, the tread will be followed by a bunch of stupid, useless, xenophobic comments."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Projecting metrics on sales, earnings, and fcf. All display approx 5x growth over next 5 yrs when reverting to mean = buy that shit!"
03/23/2021,stocks,"I bought shares last week just under 230. It’s a screaming buy right now because of the news surrounding BABA and Jack Ma lately, but once that blows over and Ant financial IPOs (BABA has a 1/3 stake), expect a run up to 300 or more."
03/23/2021,stocks,"I’m done with China stocks.

The risk is too high. The CCP could make your investment go to zero tomorrow if they wanted to."
03/23/2021,stocks,I decided to cut and run from BABA and put the money into Coupang @ 43. To much uncertainty when the Chinese govt is involved so I figured Korea would be more stable.
03/23/2021,stocks,Chinese companies bad
03/23/2021,stocks,That’s fair. A little bit of a wash in terms of potential governmental impact.
03/23/2021,stocks,Good point. Hoping to see BABA bounce back soon.
03/23/2021,stocks,How can I buy calls for $CCP?
03/23/2021,stocks,"Hello Derp2086,
This is Another hateful, thoughtless and useless comment. How would anyone think that writing 'Chinse company bad' helps to move forward a healthy discussion when talking fundamentals about a company? Eventhough we are hiding behind an emoji and a fake name, remember that here  we are what we write."
03/23/2021,stocks,"There is also the issue with Jack Ma himself, e.g the recent thing with him disappearing off the face of the earth.

I was a holder of BABA a couple months back due to the perceived low valuation, and still found myself getting burned. Eventually just cut the cord"
03/23/2021,stocks,Because the CCP can pull the plug on these companies at any point? It’s not hateful. It’s the truth. BABA is technically an off shore company used as a shell to list its Chinese company. That’s just a straight fact man.
03/23/2021,stocks,Thanks for helping me understand your point. Now I understand what you are trying to say. I appreciate your thoughts as an investor.

03/23/2021,stocks,"Good buying opportunities during the deep red swings but not touching anything with significant money until the correction is over, whether it takes weeks or months. If anyone doesn't believe in a ""correction"" then fine, whatever you want to refer to the constant market insecurity and 3-4% swings in index's on almost a daily basis."
03/23/2021,stocks,I'm not as high on Paypal and Shopify. If Stripe comes through with an IPO I'd liquidate those holdings and put it into Stripe.

03/23/2021,stocks,"id be very concerned with inflation being an issue this year.


many experts have already said to expect up to 2-3% inflation this year"
03/23/2021,stocks,Call me crazy but i think Disney should be in everyone portfolio
03/23/2021,stocks,Correction was already officially started 2 weeks ago.
03/23/2021,stocks,PayPal has venmo. PayPal is fine.
03/23/2021,stocks,"Stripe def has a lot going on. Paypal is about to allow vendors to receive crypto and has Venmo. Shopify feels so overvalued but it's a yolo portfolio and dollar cost averaging so red days aren't so scary.

The nice thing is both Paypal and Shopify are just little less than 7% of the portfolio so if they don't pan out there's 13 other stocks, 10 being high growth. Still little nerve racking when we could just invest in Home Depot, Disney, MSFT, Pepsi, JnJ, PG, and relax but the growth is abysmal with anything less than 10 years"

03/23/2021,stocks,"Don’t get spooked by the narratives they feed you, let the data guide you."
03/23/2021,stocks,Yeah and we're still in it. What has fundamentally changed from the anxieties and economic unknowns of 2 weeks ago? Jpow saying everything is going to be ok? Maybe institutional money doesn't buy it.
03/23/2021,stocks,"Yeah it's all long term holds, do we really think companies like Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Paypal, etc, won't be worth more in the future? If a correction happens, it's just better opportunity to dollar cost average and buy more shares with the same amount lol"
03/23/2021,stocks,umm no I'll be concerned with inflation looking at how tech stocks have done this year lol
03/23/2021,stocks,Yea in the long run those companies most likely dominate any value plays regardless of rising rates/inflation. Everyone is getting caught up in the present rather than focusing on the future.
03/23/2021,stocks,some of them not all
03/23/2021,stocks,"The market is already pricing in high inflation expectations, so when that story is already played out what happens next? Money flows back into tech where the growth is. Not to say other sectors and company won’t perform well but once that narrative is fully priced in the market moves on to where valuations are attractive, and you are already starting to see money move back into tech and flow out of energy and financials. And 1-2 months of underperformance doesn’t negate the past year. Can value stocks continue on their current trajectory?"
03/23/2021,stocks,"Ayy this guy gets it! I don't have thousands to invest each month like some individuals. If that was the case I would invest in dividend slow growth stocks like Pepsi. 

Some of these small tech picks won't pan out as expected, but the big tech stocks are paving the way for the future. Technology now is the only way to further improve quality of life which is a pursuit humans will never give up."

03/23/2021,stocks,"Let's not short Robinhood because the hedge funds will pull the same trick and screw us over on the other end. Instead, buy puts or invest your money in something else while we watch the stock crash and burn to the ground. They are fucked anyways if there are no buyers."

03/23/2021,stocks,Robinhood doesn't exist on my planet... The Moon.🌕
03/23/2021,stocks,You can’t really short a company into bankruptcy. Its just that the 2 tend to go together. You short a company BECAUSE its heading for bankruptcy.
03/23/2021,stocks,What I thought shorting any company that is fraudulent or not is criminal and evil?
03/23/2021,stocks,"Yeah, have fun. Will be amusing to see WSBers lose even more money on stupid plays because they think simply shorting a stock can bankrupt a company. Most of them probably think buying puts is the same as shorting lol."

Heck, I still use Robinhood for options because its so user-friendly. Ofc I keep my real investments in a real brokerage."

03/23/2021,stocks,"I think that once other major platforms, like Fidelity, start upgrading their UI and ease of use Robinhood will see a decent drop in user base."
03/23/2021,stocks,Are you asserting that GUI is not a consideration in market-share predictions?
03/23/2021,stocks,"Of course it matters. TDA/TOS have some of the most annoying watchlist to add and read, why would any brokerage allow duplicate ticker entries on their watchlist. It is also not very responsive

I also appreciate robinhood displays option breakeven price up front by percentage point. If it had more powerful spread option utilities like tos or tastywork I may even consider option trading with robinhood"

03/23/2021,stocks,"The day fidelity drops a dope ass app, its over for everyone else."
03/23/2021,stocks,It’s not nearly as important as some people make it seem
03/23/2021,stocks,"I have the robinhood app & an account. They have none of my money. I just use it for quick information, then do my business with vanguard. You don't need to use robinhood as a broker to use robinhood's features."
03/23/2021,stocks,Spoken like a true amateur
03/23/2021,stocks,"Honestly, I feel that they would fuck over every mobile platform if they just invested into it over the next year. Matter of fact, if I hear they are making an effort to update it I will buy first available puts on robinhood."

Last I heard there was ALOT of other things included like $3000 monthly payments for single mothers....
I'd look into it but I'd first research how likely that bill would pass."
03/23/2021,stocks,Yep completely agree. It hasn’t passed yet and from what I’ve read there’s a wide range of priorities/goals for the $3T. So we’ll see how this shakes out

03/23/2021,stocks,"Look, lets face it- most GME holders are playing the short squeeze and do not care about earnings. 

I think we should have a discussion on [this excerpt from the 10K filing](https://i.redd.it/kloynug4quo61.jpg) rather than the ER. This is the first time GameStop has publicly acknowledge that short positions exceeds the amount of available shares and warns of short squeeze."
03/23/2021,stocks,I dont know why people expected their earnings to be this earth shattering event that rocketed them to the moon. the whole reason the stock has been driven up this year has nothing to do with their business and everything to do with who is buying/shorting the stock.

03/23/2021,stocks,That ER is gonna force a ton of paper hands to sell. I'm actually still holding but I got in at a lower cost before the craze happened.
03/23/2021,stocks,"No one actually cared about the earnings report. They were all waiting for an announcement from either Ryan Cohen or to address the shorting issue and fake shares. The fact that these two things did not happen caused the price to tank after hours. 

This is not to say the squeeze is over because it's not. It's just delayed until GME addresses the issue vis recalling of shares at their annual shareholder meeting in June."
03/23/2021,stocks,"it was climbing a min ago nicely, was nice seeing some good green to this red day lol"
03/23/2021,stocks,The delusional GME rocket boy crowd will spin this as good news and the negative Nancy bears will spin this as bad news.
03/23/2021,stocks,"So this stock disconnects from its fundamentals for months, and no one cares. But then this stock reports some of its fundamentals, and the stock falls on the news. The people invested in this stock need to make up their minds, do they care about the fundamentals or not?😂

What I’m trying to say is: if you bought this stock at anything above $20, you clearly didn’t care about its fundamentals. So why would you sell due to bad news about fundamentals? It makes no sense."

Who's gonna watch a guy who tells viewers to expect <5% moves, slightly downward, over the next week?"

03/23/2021,stocks,Pivoting to what exactly? It’s never gonna complete with Amazon when it comes to E-Retail. It’s never gonna complete with Steam or any other downloading service. E-sports? Magic tournaments? Just an FYI communities that can support leagues and tournaments they are already exist.

03/23/2021,stocks,"The PS5 is the fastest selling console in the US *ever*. The revenue is there, Gamestop just isn't getting a piece of the pie."
03/23/2021,stocks,"The PS5 is the fastest selling console in the US... ever. It's more of a demand issue than a supply issue. Nvidia and AMD just reported all-time record quarters.

Definitely not the circumstances where you'd expect a revenue *decrease* from the previous year for a company whose main business is video game console products."
03/23/2021,stocks,"I'm a woman but I call other women 'dude' so all good. He is skating a very fine line. He's not telling anybody what to do BUT right after earnings he posts his position. There are young people who are throwing things they can't afford lose when he posts things like that. I think it's wrong. He should actually take time to type something. He'll still have over 30 mill if this stock goes under. I don't like it. That said, everyone is free to make their own decisions. It is manipulative on his part. He can drive it into the ground with options. Most don't know how to do that."
03/23/2021,stocks,"When tons of people post “If he’s still in, I’m still in” daily and he then posts that he is still in, it’s hard to argue that he’s not making a statement of some sort. Again, plausible deniability has its limits."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Lol even if he didn't cash out he can ride it. Gme would have to fall to unreasonably low levels for his ""150K"" worth of shares to not be retirement worthy."
03/23/2021,stocks,And? That's their problem. Everyone wants his updates. People shouldn't play with money they can't afford to lose.
03/23/2021,stocks,Isn’t he already set for life?
03/23/2021,stocks,"I understand this to a certain point but he'll have 39 million even if he tanks on what he currently holds on this position. It's not entirely truthful. I wish you well, though. Please know that. I'm not remotely a 'boomer' but I'm not liking this move on his part."
03/23/2021,stocks,I understand that others do what they want but he holds heavy sway.
03/23/2021,stocks,That number of shares isn’t capable of manipulating price...
03/23/2021,stocks,"LMAO, a small retail investor being transparent about his position is market manupulation now? Get a grip."
03/23/2021,stocks,I admire what he first did while he held for years but this is a bit much.
03/23/2021,stocks,Don’t you think this stock is being manipulated?
03/23/2021,stocks,Yeah 100% agree. These revenue numbers are fitting for a $3-4bn company maybe - not a $15bn company reflected in the current share price
03/23/2021,stocks,"I'm so damn glad I got out at $200. Took a modest profit, and now I get to sit back with popcorn."
03/23/2021,stocks,On the other hand there weren't many consoles to be sold. Xbox Series X and PS5s are still mostly sold out and only available in homeopathic doses.
03/23/2021,stocks,It wouldn't. I expect it to take a few years to complete the turn around.
03/23/2021,stocks,Stocks haven't been fully based on reality for a while now.
03/23/2021,stocks,"They are literally paying what they think the company *will* be worth someday. How they think it's so high is beyond me, the fact they are arguing it's worth even more has to be a joke right? No one is really that stupid"
03/23/2021,stocks,Just like Chewy never did?
03/23/2021,stocks,"Yeah, I'm trying to wrap my head around this. I can't think of any service that Gamestop e-commerce could offer that would justify installing ANOTHER game client. Plenty of deep discount retailers in addition to Steam and Epic. I guess the best would be a ""Netflix for games"" kinda approach, but good luck beating XBox Gamepass at that, I'm already drowning in games I don't have time to play."
03/23/2021,stocks,The forward P/E is only -860. I'm adding it to my value portfolio tomorrow at market open. They'll be up (down?) to -700 in no time.
03/23/2021,stocks,There are only two options tho so the next alternative is not talking about it at all
03/23/2021,stocks,"How’d he prove his point? You can’t say “it’s not great” without being lumped into “the sky is falling!”?

All he says is it’s not great, like sex with your mom. I got off, but it wasn’t great."
03/23/2021,stocks,Not really a negative Nancy though.
03/23/2021,stocks,"> It's more of a demand issue than a supply issue

Pre orders were sold out in record time and closed shortly after because they knew there wouldn't be enough consoles available for all the pre orders, this is 100% a supply issue."
03/23/2021,stocks,"You do realize this isn’t anything out of the ordinary right?

He HAS BEEN periodically doing this for months. Also he had already said whatever he needed to say in his videos and during the congressional hearing. Everything regarding risks and volatility. I think you’re nitpicking a bit"
03/23/2021,stocks,"I think you’re right on the money. And I suspect that when/if this all goes south, there will be many of his current fans who will argue that same point."
03/23/2021,stocks,I completely agree with you. Those kids throwing all of their money at it is what’s making him his millions. They think he’s an ally when in reality he’s using them as his personal pump and dump army. My opinion anyway lol.
03/23/2021,stocks,"That’s their decision. Not his. 

Imagine you’re going skydiving and people are saying if you’re skydiving, they’re skydiving too!

If someone gets hurt, can I hold you responsible for going skydiving when you know ppl (for whatever reason) have decide to follow you without you explicitly telling them to?"
03/23/2021,stocks,No he won't. His current account value is 39 million. It tanked to zero he'd have 11 million. Then taxes so more like 8 million. At least be accurate in what you're saying.
03/23/2021,stocks,"Seriously, he's already taken profits during the first wave. If it drops to $40 tomorrow could and still walk away with more money than a lot of us will see in our lifetimes. I don't think what he's doing is unethical... but maybe an irresponsible use of his platform."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Seriously, all of the blatant manipulation around GME and you worry about DFV???"
03/23/2021,stocks,"To an extent yeah, I think that there is manipulation, like with all stocks."
03/23/2021,stocks,"But they are building out new revenue streams in ecommerce, PC hardware, digital game downloads, and TVs. Personally I'd expect the revenues to increase over time. Not saying they will 4x, but they'll go up."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Lol, I got in at $69 and out at $300. Honestly I hope they do all get rich, but I’m thinking it will slowly and painfully resunc with GameStop’s actual performance"
03/23/2021,stocks,How much was the popcorn?
03/23/2021,stocks,Or get back in cheaper?
03/23/2021,stocks,"Also, the reddit rally has somewhat raised the profile so maybe Q1 2021 sales will be healthier because of the retail investors also going in to buy stuff."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Chewy came from nothing to create a market that didn't exist. Gamestop is a mature company in a large existing industry. If Gamestop controlled every single transaction that occured in the gaming industry It could justify a bullish increase in the current share price. But that's not going to happen. Gaming is not an industry that's experiencing yoy expontial growth. For Gamestop to achieve every bull's delusional dream, their profits have to come at the expense of competitors, which are already well established. There is no moat. There is no niche. There is no untapped market."
03/23/2021,stocks,"We can argue whether it's demand or supply or if there's a difference. What's inarguable is that Gamestop was unable to even beat the revenue it earned from the final year of PS4/X1 sales, even though the launch has been a cash cow for other companies involved. At the end of the day, all that matters is getting a piece of that pie."
03/23/2021,stocks,"This EXACTLY. He's been providing decent DD on GME way before the craze happened. If you watched his hearing, he was not lying on any bit of his answers when Congress questioned him."
03/23/2021,stocks,Or he just believed in the stock similar to how he did years ago. Adjusting his thesis as new information becomes available.
03/23/2021,stocks,"If I they only went skydiving because I kept telling them how great skydiving was? Yeah, I’d have to say I might have had something to do with it."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Yeah, absolutely. If it goes back down to ~$40, I'll probably buy in again just for shits."
03/23/2021,stocks,I doubt retail investors would make a blip on the profits.
03/23/2021,stocks,"Petsmart, Walmart, Amazon. They all sell what Chewy sells.  I didn't think Chewy would be able to compete, but it is."
03/23/2021,stocks,"I agree that there’s less open market comparing gaming to pet food, but I wouldn’t say that Chewy created a market that didn’t exist. Amazon, petco, petsmart, and Walmart all sold pet food online, and I’m sure there are others I don’t know about. And I would again disagree that gaming isn’t a rapidly expanding market. There’s plenty of room for multiple big players within the gaming industry. And yeah, there’s a LOT of speculation in regards to where the company will go, but I think it’s a perfectly viable time to speculate, and I’m comfortable placing that bet. I do think the ridiculously high ceilings people are putting on it are more of a meme than anything else, but with such a low float, I can absolutely see GameStop being worth more than it currently is."
03/23/2021,stocks,They did reduce their overall footprint and still nearly make the same amount of sales. It 100 prevent is a supply issue though. If they had ps5 and xbox in stock and had poor revenue then you'd have a point. They're literally selling them as far as they get them. That means if they had more they would be selling more.
03/23/2021,stocks,"Heck yeah he did! That’s cool, no hating here. He made it big and I applaud him for it, there’s for sure a lot of bag holders and blind hype though lol"
03/23/2021,stocks,"Telling people how great skydiving is IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT than telling people to go skydiving. 

Do you hold commercials responsible too?

My goodness you will get eaten alive in court or in any rational discussion."
03/23/2021,stocks,I have puts on it. I'm currently thinking about selling those and buying in because it's funny to me
03/23/2021,stocks,I mean... Gamestop couldn't have as much publicity as it has over the last two month even with a $500 million dollar marketing budget
03/23/2021,stocks,"Just like they didn’t make a blip on their stock price? Idk man, we’ll have to see when Q1 earnings come."
03/23/2021,stocks,"You can be as insulting as you want to be. It changes absolutely nothing about what your boy is doing and the effect it could be having. 

Also you might want to note that there are MANY laws related to advertisements. But I’m sure you already knew that.

Edited to add: Nevermind. I just checked your post history. It’s pretty clear you are part of the cult."
03/23/2021,stocks,"those puts will worthless tomorrow, IV crush incoming tomorrow, never hold options through earnings"
03/23/2021,stocks,I was wanting to get some but the premiums are ridiculous.  You should sell with nice profit if you sell them tomorrow.  The stock is getting crushed AH
03/23/2021,stocks,"You think that would really outpace the holiday season, pandemic gaming boom, and new console release?"
03/23/2021,stocks,That’s... not the same at all. There is big money behind the current GME price. You really think the people who threw their life savings are now spending all their extra money at GameStop?
03/23/2021,stocks,There are laws. But none applied here. You’re digging still dude smh
03/23/2021,stocks,"the answer is yes, as unwilling as you are to believe it"
03/23/2021,stocks,Proof?
03/23/2021,stocks,"lol do you want me to post a picture of my last haul? i can only speak from my own experience. but if you think people that invested in GME aren't also trying to buy product from GameStop and support their business, you might be a lil dull


Edit: I looked at your comment history and apparently you're just an insanely pessimistic and combative person 🤣"
03/23/2021,stocks,Then that is your bias talking. Read “Thinking Fast and Slow”. People who are throwing their life savings and multiple paychecks into this do not have money to support the business.
03/23/2021,stocks,"okay. so the (most definitely probably) greater percentage of people invested in GME did NOT invest their whole life savings. therefore the majority of people invested in GME have the funds to support the business.


cool argument"
03/23/2021,stocks,"You’re right! Most definitely the majority of people invested in GME are hedge funds and millionaires/billionaires. People who would never and will never shop at GameStop. Face it, the majority invested in GME are just riding the wave. You have no proof other than your own biases."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Dude, give it up. This guy read a book once. He knows the financial state of every retail investor. Take a look. It's in the book. 

*me: 4 shares, very small percentage of non-401k portfolio, very VERY small percentage of entire life savings. Plenty of disposable income left over each month. Every other person I know in real life who owns shares is in the exact same position. Yolo'd for lulz, to be part of the ""fun"", and a chance at a quick buck, but ready to lose it all if that how it be like."
03/23/2021,stocks,"okay so you agree that the majority of gme investors did not invest their life savings and have enough money to buy product at gamestop. thanks for agreeing with my original point.


i never said they will or won't, i said they can."
03/23/2021,stocks,"idk dude, i think that's just your confirmation bias talking ;p"
03/23/2021,stocks,Ooof. The book is about realizing biases within your thinking. You should read it too.
03/23/2021,stocks,Wrong. You said they will. Look up.
03/23/2021,stocks,"Yeah, so in summation- I think retail investors are inclined to buy product at gamestop to support the business. Seems pretty obvious. No, I don't have data to support that it's actually happening.


Your argument is that retail investors of gme either don't have to funds to buy product at gamestop or just aren't because they are riding a hype train. You also have no data or proof.


Great job 👍"
03/23/2021,stocks,"No, my argument is that retail investors have so little funds supporting the business and are such a small percentage of stock ownership that they would not be noticeable."

03/23/2021,stocks,One of the worst big automobile companies.
03/23/2021,stocks,For what it’s worth: Last summer when I was car shopping I looked at Nissan but then read over and over again about how Nissan is now what Kia used to be while Kia is now what Nissan used to be. For that reason I didn’t buy a Nissan and I also will not buy their stock.
03/23/2021,stocks,Unless they’re coming out with something really game changing I’d say stay away.
03/23/2021,stocks,"They were one of the big car makers in the 90's and then suddenly stopped making interesting cars ...

Once such a good brand and now they offer only 'lame' family cars only. Which are the bread and butter cars, but marketing is also important and Nissan currently has no car for showing off. (both the 370Z and GTR are basically 10+ years old and a successor is nowhere in sight)

They had a great start with EV with the Nissan Leaf, but that's also it. Every other car maker now also has EV and Nissan gets left behind.

I think with Toyota you are better off. They at least experiment with interesting cars (Yaris GR, new Supra and GT-86) and also go for EV, maybe even faster than Nissan.

If you want an undervalued car company, go for Hyundai."
03/23/2021,stocks,Nissan is basically Japan's version of Ford. Shit all around.
03/23/2021,stocks,"I wish I could buy KIA stock, Nissan...not so much."
03/23/2021,stocks,Could you elaborate? I'm interested to know why you think this.
03/23/2021,stocks,"The cars they make a generally pretty low quality and unreliable. It's not Nissan of the 80s and 90s. They've been declining in quality for years after they were bought by Renault. Where I live at least, you'll see Nissan Rogues literally everywhere. They finance anybody with a pulse"
03/23/2021,stocks,their CVTs are trash
03/23/2021,stocks,Looks very similar to what BB does. I might get a position and bet on both horses
03/23/2021,stocks,Why do you think the decline since IPO?
03/23/2021,stocks,Thanks for the DD.
03/23/2021,stocks,"I think this has huge upside potential, it's kind of pricey to take a big jump into. I'm going to watch a little and see if it bottoms out. I like the stock. 🐸"
03/23/2021,stocks,They actually power BlackBerry as well. BB is listed on their customers page.
03/23/2021,stocks,Lack of any PR and lack of understanding about what they do.
03/23/2021,stocks,"I see!  Is the high barrier to entry that you have to first get people to use your repo for their software?  So JFROG is doing well in that regard since they already got a lot of companies and have a huge repo

Also, yahoo finance shows market cap as 4.6B instead of 4.9B.  Just curious where you get your numbers?"
03/23/2021,stocks,I’ve actually been accumulating XPO in anticipation of a split in Q2.
03/23/2021,stocks,"I can totally see where you’re coming from with the trajectory this was on for the past few administrations, but I wouldn’t necessarily see privatizing a currently public service as a possibility for the current makeup of congress or the executive branch.

 I had read some Congress people floating ideas to roll back the policies that started eroding the USPS, or even allow them to open bank accounts or cash checks for people. Not a top priority policy, but definitely sounds like the feeling is currently how to make this work, and not how to let Dejoy finish killing the USPS. 

I also just think we’ll always need them because rural routes will never be profitable enough for big business to subsidize every day delivery, and the point of the public post office is service not profit."
03/23/2021,stocks,"I think long term logistics will pay off big but we have plenty of time. Freight haulers will become much, much more valuable when they cut drivers from the payroll. Long haul truckers will be the first significant victims of automation along with fast food workers. Investors love it when people lose their jobs.

Government won't let USPS fail yet. Too many boomers still rely on snail mail. I wish I could opt out of mail entirely. 99.9% of goes right in the trash every day. The other 0.1% could have been an email."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Good thinking, here. A lot of people went to on-line shopping and I don't believe they'll abandon that post pandemic. I think Amazon logistics is the fastest growing. They are quickly working towards changing the fact that most of their planes, pilots, trucks and drivers are being contracted and leased currently. Also, building an air hub.  They don't have a separate stock for their logistics, though. I'm waiting for TuSimple to launch their IPO, for which the paperwork has already been filed. They're the ones that make Autonomous Trucks. I know the big companies that are buying from them, I know they've hauled Autonomous loads for Budweiser, I just don't know if they'll keep hauling for customers on top of making the trucks. Amazon and UPS on your list have purchased, and will cost them up front but save a lot in the future, so they'd be good. The others, would be good long term investments.  I'm not a professional investor. All of this is just opinions from a professional truck driver. This is a great post, following."
03/23/2021,stocks,"this is awesome, thanks!  I just threw out those names as examples as the big boys in the room.  I'm guessing there are some others under the radar to a certain extent that I guess I'm hoping other similar minded Redditors might suggest."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Why are the spikes followed by ralies? because the bond yield falls after the spike, that chart is sorta half complete but the real story it shows is, bonds down market up"
03/23/2021,stocks,"Interesting but the bonds were down today, and the market was down?"
03/23/2021,stocks,"Its not that the actual act of bond yields going up or down that influence the market but the institutional and retail sentiment behind those acts. If people buy bonds, they feel inflation or deflation is coming and pull money from equity."
03/23/2021,stocks,"The chart is a monthly one. It means that we might be down next week, maybe the week after 2, but the point is that, after the peak, there's usually a bull-run. It doesn't necessarily mean rally, just that we may have some continuous upward movement over the next year, maybe 2"
03/23/2021,stocks,"Bond yields going down is actually bonds being bought, today looks like the start of quarter-end rebalancing and with how much bonds have been dumped, that means huge funds buy the big dip in them and sell stocks."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Well bonds are not the only thing that dictate up or down they can as well as other factors, today was likely caused by yellen saying that asset price look high and well she's not wrong lol"
03/23/2021,stocks,"That's more correlation dosnt equal causation because yeilds went up before 2000 and 2008 and we all know how that ended, the market typically goes up so most chances are the market will go up after yields rise."
03/23/2021,stocks,You are 100% intentionally misrepresenting what Yelled said.
03/23/2021,stocks,"You can use that line on everything, it doesn't have weight in the stock market. It would be like saying a stock went up, not because they released some good news, but rather because there's something mysterious going on in the background. In 2008, after the bond yields spiked, we did enter a bull market. 2000, and 2011 were the 2 cases where a bearish run proceeded the spike in bond yields. When a bull run has followed a bond yield spike in the vast majority of cases, there's definitely a possible correlation there."
03/23/2021,stocks,What did she say then?
03/23/2021,stocks,"Obviously the vast majority of times a bull market has come after a bond rally, because bull markets are so much more common and the two Baer markets is recent memory bond yields have missed and this trend didn't work"
03/23/2021,stocks,"Yellen says ""valuations are elevated by historical metrics."" She adds that what's important is for regulators to make sure that the financial sector is resilient, and to make sure that markets work well, and that financial institutions are appropriately managing their risks.

Powell downplays worries about asset bubbles. ""Some asset prices are a bit high but the banking system is highly capitalized and funding risk is relatively modest,"" he said. Leverage of households is somewhat elevated but nothing like it was before the financial crisis,"" he said. So it's a ""mixed picture,"" he added.

I'm not sure why I bothered. You post here for one reason and it's not intellectual honesty."
03/23/2021,stocks,You understand that while the economy might not be at risk the stock market could be right? They are basically saying stocks are in a bubble but the economy is fine so don't worry. But if you are in the stock market the fed & treasury saying we are in a bubble is the exact thing that will worry wall street.
03/23/2021,stocks,"Yes, it means that the Fed doesn't mind if T-note yields go higher to cool the market a little bit more. Thus no cigar for those who were hoping for YCC."

03/23/2021,stocks,[deleted]
03/23/2021,stocks,"My answer might be scattered here. 

Look for this: EPS, PE ratio, P/B ratio, PEG ratio. Also look at debt and cash. I personally like to evaluate the leadership as well. 

I’ve also learned to ignore EBITDA

My favorite site is Macrotrends when comparing stocks"

Maybe play with 1000 until you feel a little comfortable then put the rest in, I started maybe half a year ago when I was a lot more broke than I am now and am grateful for the lessons I learned from small losses which would’ve been bigger if I dived in from the start."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Do what you will. The stock market is a dog eat dog world. It is vicious, unforgiving, and we play for keeps. Every sale has a buyer and by your own admission you have less experience than the person on the other side of the trade. That gives you really high odds of loosing your 5k. If you are really serious, you should start out by paper trading and make sure you know what you are doing before you put any money up. Unless you don’t mind loosing every single bit of your 5k. If you really don’t mind to lose it, go ahead. But this isn’t December or January anymore. You probably aren’t gonna 10x your investment by buying what everyone else is. Most people blow up their account (lose ALL their money) multiple times before they see anything resembling success. You asked for friendly advice, this is about as friendly as it gets. Good luck."

03/23/2021,stocks,I see. I will actually do that. Thanks for the advice. 5000 is alot for me personally and I am quite nervous. Another question is are losses pretty much common?
03/23/2021,stocks,Thank you very much for the resources!
03/23/2021,stocks,My advice would to stay away from day trading at the start
03/23/2021,stocks,"Depends on trading style.  If you day trade you will have losses.  If you do growth, you will probably have some losses.  If you dividend you are less likely to have losses.  If you S&P index as long as you don't sell, you will likely recover any losses eventually.  Increased risk has more potential for quick gains, but increased potential for losses."
03/23/2021,stocks,"It depends how you trade. If you throw 5k into FANG / tesla? You’ll probably be alright and if you hold long enough won’t lose much if anything.

I enjoy searching for smaller companies and testing my luck and I lose money sometimes, but overall I’m up about 100% total from the crazy past year.

If 5000 is a lot for you then like I said just start slow, you might make some dumb mistakes as an absolute beginner and it’s best not to take too many chances. The stock market will be there for a long time, and I know with all the hype recently you probably want to get involved since you feel like you’re missing out but patience is key. Wish I had more advice to give but I’m not an expert by any means, just know how it is to be in your position. Good luck!"
03/23/2021,stocks,For index funds is it optimal to buy and sell quick or more towards holding as much as possible?
03/23/2021,stocks,Thank you for the advice!
03/23/2021,stocks,Index and dividend tends to be a buy and hold style.  Growth and day trading are more active buy and sell.

Had some pretty strict arrangements with the company too so he didnt have any ''foreknowledge''(is that a word?).

He wasn't a single shareholder tho. Its almost impossible to achieve that alone."

I'll closely watch my swing trades through trends/supports - buying somewhere below the moving average. Sell when it's up in the green. Sometimes I'll hop off the ride early, but small gains add up.

Most of these gains will go into high conviction stocks and diversified ETFs/mutual funds where I'll actually hold long.

Don't forget to factor in taxes."

03/23/2021,stocks,Yeah I mean its more of a gamble than an investment. But you can deffinitely make money doing it...Or lose money...or screw yourself out of a good investment trying to make a quick buck because it keeps going back up

03/23/2021,stocks,I’ve really only been paying attention to price action and areas of resistance/support. How important is volume weighed against those metrics?
03/23/2021,stocks,Damn. Sincere thanks for taking the time to point this out. Had no idea.
03/23/2021,stocks,"When wash sale applies the previous losses are added onto your new cost basis, effectively making the loss now contained within the new similar purchase to be realized when you choose to sell it. You defer the loss, but it’s not disallowed forever. You’ll get the benefit of the loss when you eventually sell the new shares (unless it’s another wash sale).

This effectively prevents you from selling all your losses and buying back in immediately to realize losses for tax purposes of reducing your net capital gains. But it doesn't actually lose you money. If you really want to realize your losses for that tax period, you just have to sell and not buy back again, but even if you don't you haven't really lost money, you effectively just haven't sold yet, except the difference in sale and purchase price (which is the potential for gains/losses from swing trading)."
03/23/2021,stocks,I find it easier to work with the highs and lows of a day then it is to try to predict the next big news.
03/23/2021,stocks,The higher the volume the heavier the support/resistance is. If there's huge volume at the support line it means a lot of buyers are watching and waiting for the right time to get their money in. Large sell-offs at resistance lines means more people are eager to take profits and get out.

My thoughts are purely personal though, there really isn’t too much fundamentals with my opinion on TopGolf it’s one of those plays where I have a personal connection and have had experience going to multiple locations and have noticed they stay busy and I like their business. The sport of golf itself though I believe may be dwindling down, although TopGolf may inspire some of the younger generation to try it."

The ""retail investor"" is like a barncle on the hull of this stock's ship, its along for the ride up or down but doesnt effect the travel.

I made a few hundred on the swings and hold 1 share now just for historic value. 

If you still have a big pile of shares its legit betting on black or red at this point so either escape now with some saved before it tanks or take a chance but expect to most likely lose 90% of it im highly doubting it will ever see above 400 in the next 5 years"
03/23/2021,stocks,"1. Understand that since no one here can explain how AFTER the so called frenzy the price went from ~40 - 348.50 yet will confidently will call it conspiracy is something to think about. 

2. While Wsb had 7 million new members, r/stock has gathered 1.6 million new members since the craze. Meaning more than half of the people here are just as new.

3. The ape and diamond hand thing while possibly annoying, its FUD ( fear, uncertainty, doubt) proof. This, of course, leads to an echo chamber which can be bad but is impenetrable. Therefore you would have to go outside to hear another stance. I have found r/stock to be FUD central to gme. Here exist a pretentious vibe stating they are fair and thoughtful. But see point 2. This place has just as many new people too and the copium is a two way street. People wish they got in in the 40s therefore must make some excuse to why people getting in in the 300s is bad (which has merit) but it makes them feel relieved they didn't get in. But see point 1, they can't and have not explained even after 2 weeks later what happened. Spouting gamma squeeze isn't a DD for or against this. 

4. Being new to stocks in general has a high learning curve. People say learning fundamentals is key. But will ignore market mechanics no matter how many times that Cramer video is posted. The reality is its a mix where a vast majority will under appreciate the underhandedness in price manipulation. 

I got in twice early and made money. Its foolish to act like with a little sense you can't understand this situation. No matter how many people give you DDs or not YOU will make your mind up. Making your mind up after is FOMO making it up before is ""research"". Do what you want with your money."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Just remember that Blackrock owns most of the shares. There’s no hedge fund vs. retail battle going on, it’s all the big boys. Join the hype if you want but remember that they can pull the rug whenever they want"
03/23/2021,stocks,"My problem with the WSB/GME/AMC crowd is the constant ramp up for gamma squeezes. Not so much the short squeeze. They keep re-iterating the premise that we need to hit $xx by Fri and it'll gamma squeeze! This is not accurate at all.

With how quickly prices increase and decrease the ITM calls will get priced in at some point before Friday. So when it hits $xx on Fri and it doesn't gamma, and opens red Mon the cycle continues believing this is the week it's going to gamma squeeze.

It's just terribly ignorant without any basis. Literally zero understanding of how this works and it's literally fools teaching other fools."
03/23/2021,stocks,"My thoughts right now are that there is some sort of psychological warfare being fought over it. There are two sides. One side is anyone who shorted the stock at any point trying to get people to sell.

The other side is bag-holders from the original spike trying to get people to buy.

I don’t think any of the information available on it has been neutral since the first big spike.

At this point I can’t possibly see it going anywhere. To me it looks like the stock is completely detached from its fundamentals. That means it’s driven by hype and hype alone.

You can’t predict hype so you can’t predict what the stock is going to do.

I may get grilled here because this is a totally different point of view. But that’s just my own observation."
03/23/2021,stocks,"If there was a short squeeze on GME that somehow went to just $10,000, let alone $100,000, it would have a devastating effect across the entire financial system. My mind can't even process all the implications of it going that high. I imagine the government/SEC would have to step in before that point though.

Regardless though, I don't think it could ever get that high. Suppose you have diamond hands and bought 100 shares at $50. Let's pretend the price magically reaches $5000. You now have $500,000 based on a measly $5000 investment. You're really going to risk a half million dollars by holding even longer and seeing if it reaches $10000? Heck no--even if you believe in GME as a company, you know deep down it shouldn't be worth more than walmart."

Here's a look at some [alternative data points](https://dillibits.com/index.php?t=GME) before the earnings report on Tuesday.

* First things first, GME is the most mentioned stock on Reddit and it’s not even close. Since January, GME has been mentioned an average of 10.000+ times per day on Reddit.
* Gamestop is also among the most mentioned stocks on the popular forum StockTwits with around 11.000+ mentions per day. Sentiment is high, 81% of all mentions are bullish.
* Gamestop gets around 1,000 new followers per day on Instagram. That is an impressive number, especially compared to their competitors.
* All mentions on social media have probably been one driving factor to the increase of website visitors. [Gamestop.com](http://gamestop.com/) attracted around 53 million visitors in February, up 30% since October last year.
* Gamestop’s mobile apps (where users can get personalized gaming news and buy games) are downloaded 250k times per month, up from around 210k a month ago. Decent growth. And users like the apps, the average review is 4.5 stars out of 5.
* Around 42k people are working for Gamestop and the company currently has 6,282 open job positions. This is a high number but it’s actually down from 6,672 in December and the number of total employees is also down by 3k in the last year. A growing company should have an increase in open positions month over month (if it’s not restructuring or pivoting) so this is a little bit of a red flag.
* The average employee review is pretty low (3.2 stars out of 5) and employees are complaining about Management and limited Career Opportunities.

03/23/2021,stocks,"Sigh. I'll offer some thoughts. I bought when it was around 8 and sold for $300. I havent bought again and dont intend to. Just do some basic math with your price targets. There are about 69,000,000 shares outstanding. 69,000,000 x 1000= 69 billion market cap. In what universe is Gme worth 69 billion?"
03/23/2021,stocks,"GME shares can be borrowed easily through most major brokers, so there is no longer any short squeeze potential; institutional investors moved out of their short trades in that and other meme stocks a long time ago.

A favorite play of institutional investors for quite a while has been to sell GME calls to the WSB crowd in order to take advantage of the high IV created by their out of touch echo-chamber."

I wrote it & it’s as unbiased as I can get it."
03/23/2021,stocks,"I wouldn't buy it with your money. The daily threads on WSB all seem a bit qanon at this point. People who have been in the markets for literally days are spouting all kinds of crazy conspiracies about what date it's going to pop and why, and if you dare to question the groupthink you will get downvoted into oblivion. Hard to believe the smart money isn't 3 steps ahead of them at this point"
03/23/2021,stocks,"I bought in @ $4.5 and sold @ $35 in January. That was way to early. Even with the E commerce growth 2020, i do not think it's a good bet at current price levels. 

Maybe i'm wrong"
03/23/2021,stocks,"From what I found the short percentage of float is only around 20% , roughly 11m shares. A short squeeze improbable at this point, a gamma squeeze is still possible however unlikely with a fair amount options expiring this Friday and next Friday. $1000/share is unrealistic, $10000/share is ludicrous and $100,000/share could only be a meme. 

Not financial advise"
03/23/2021,stocks,"Made a ton on Round 1, not buying any at these prices, and would sell if I still held any shares.  I did sell some 40P a few weeks ago for a good premium, and would sell more at that strike if/when the share price drops down again."

03/23/2021,stocks,"GME is a unicorn. TA and fundamentals didn't apply for a while, but eventually they will and the price will follow suit. Since the initial climb, it's risen far from lows *twice* \- giving buyers a window to make more, break even, or minimize losses if they got in at an absurd entry.

Other subs are entertaining and may have valuable information, but have a plan if you see an opportunity, and don't get greedy with those lofty price targets. Holding is a valid strategy if you research from multiple (sometimes conflicting) sources and come up with your own conviction."
03/23/2021,stocks,"No I think it has run its course. You guys have been awesome entertainment and I'm sure you cost more than one rich fucker a ton of money, but it's ridiculous to think it would ever hit $1000. You guys haven't had as much to do with this as you think you do. The guys and gals at WSB have excess gambling money and that's awesome, but if you don't then I'd be very careful following their lead. My number 1 rule when looking at buying is to stay far away from whatever the Reddit FOTM is. Every winner pumped up on Reddit has dozens of deadbeat cousins that lay around taking your money. If anyone around here actually knew what they were talking about they would be on their yacht doing blow off hookers asses, not messing around on a social media forum. Getting stock advice on Reddit is the equivalent of getting medical advice on Facebook."

* Gamestop’s mobile apps (where users can get personalized gaming news and buy games) are downloaded 250k times per month, up from around 210k a month ago. Decent growth. And users like the apps, the average review is 4.5 stars out of 5.
* Around 42k people are working for Gamestop and the company currently has 6,282 open job positions. This is a high number but it’s actually down from 6,672 in December and the number of total employees is also down by 3k in the last year. A growing company should have an increase in open positions month over month (if it’s not restructuring or pivoting) so this is a little bit of a red flag.
* The average employee review is pretty low (3.2 stars out of 5) and employees are complaining about Management and limited Career Opportunities.

Today’s possible equity offering of more common stock was the worst thing that could have been said for shareholders. Likely what’s leading to its further decline."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Most expect them to contact shareholders for a vote concerning their June 12th meeting. Shareholders are contacted 60 days prior, so in the April 12th range. Guess what? Faux-shares can’t vote. So, there are a lot of people expecting that to shine light on naked shares and force shorts to cover. We shall see"

But i try to get out of the echochamber r/WSB and r/GME as there are no catalysts until like june ? ( for Q1 reports, where they made alot of hype cash.) 

Or are there?  What about the stuff with the synthetic shares, don't they need to cover them? Aren't also whales on our side against Citadel/Melvin?"

03/23/2021,stocks,"Not only do I agree about the SEC stepping in and somehow stopping the price going beyond anything at $1,000+ (potentially)  

But I also think that too many people would be more than happy to see it at $500 and take a short gain at that point, ultimately never driving it beyond crucial points like $500 or $750 or $1,000 due to people cashing out."

03/23/2021,stocks,"Fact is no one knows wtf is going on. There wasn’t a catalyst on this second run up and it shot up from $40 to $350. My theory is Citadel covers the shorts up until a certain price point, then once it gets too expensive they stop for a month or so, make back some profits on the price drop and then once it drops far enough they start covering more of their shorts again. Rinse and repeat until they’ve totally covered. No one is margin calling citadel, they basically do what they want."

03/23/2021,stocks,What retail cash out at won't matter. The largest players are institutional. If they cash out at $500 then that's that but they decide to hold to $1000 then the ceiling is $1000.

03/23/2021,stocks,"Yeah no offence but that link you posted isn’t DD at all - someone is just hyping the stock plain and simple, with a word salad of terms that don’t really mean anything.

By all means keep holding GME if you believe in the company long term. What you have to realize though is even in the best case scenario, it will take years for their fundamentals to grow into their current $15bn valuation. So if the meme hype ever wears off - well it will be a painful trip back down to earth, let’s put it that way"
03/23/2021,stocks,The post reads more like a cargo cult manifesto than market research...
03/23/2021,stocks,"Look you need to acknowledge the few red flags.

\- When there's a market wide dip, and GME dips - WSB blames the hedge funds. The most recent example when money was moved out of equities into bonds a week or two back. I don't know what they're speculating as far as today, but I have to imagine hedge funds are the scape goat.

\- The constant belief in the options chain and that everyone is exercising calls. You can sell a contract without exercising to make money. The options chain should be used for nothing more than an indicator for market sentiment.

\- The Call options triggering a gamma squeeze. If a call option can trigger a gamma squeeze, the reverse can also happen. The P/C ratio has always been on the Bear side for GME. Should you really be surprised that the stock is now dropping?

\- Name one catalyst that caused the second rise in the stock. Just one. The first time GME spiked in January was due to a true gamma squeeze. This second one was not a gamma squeeze."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Borrow it, take apart the basket, cover everything but GME, use the shares you now have of GME to cover your failures to deliver. You still eventually need to buy each GME share back."

03/23/2021,stocks,"That’s....not how it works. Even if it was, at most, these ETFs hold like 10% in GameStop, so it would be stupid to try and short it that way."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Interesting play in this market, and I think your assessments are solid. One area that may hinder growth for this company (beyond what you have already pointed out) is the fear of tracking that may limit growth. There’s an entire subset of the population that is averse to having any kind of tracking devices in their possession. While this is only a subset, I think it’s reasonable to assume that some portion of the potential customer base will be driven off by this.

I’m also curious why they use physical tracking devices for the mileage instead of just having an app that is installed on users phones that will do this. The cost of software would potentially be a lot less expensive than using physical devices. Installation would be a non-issue for the most part as well."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Basically, it is to ensure the readings are reliable so avoid fraud. They also boast a metric of data possession, think Cathie Wood and her emphasis on Tesla's billions of miles of consumer driving data collected by the vehicles. The difference to me is that their hardware data collection is nothing like Tesla. I see it mostly as a clever marketing tactic to offset the concerns you and I share about the hardware privacy aspect."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Ah, okay, that all makes sense. I was wondering about the fraud aspect if phone apps were used. Just about anything can be hacked or used fraudulently. Thank you for the response!"
03/23/2021,stocks,"That book was published before free brokerages.   

Same reason why people often misquote Buffet from like 2001. Buffet quite correctly warned against manual volume trading because high brokerage fees killed most of your returns (e.g. $5/trade); his insight was correct at the time, but people apply it to today without acknowledging that free trading Vs pay-per-trade is huge.     

Just to be clear I'm a firm believer in low fee high coverage index funds like VTI, but just be careful with outdated information because it is outdated."
03/23/2021,stocks,"The cost associated is the expense ratio.  It is available in the prospectus from any fund or ETF.  If it also available on most sites that give detailed information.  Here you can see the expense ratio for VOO is 0.03% but SPY is 0.09% even though they track the same thing.  Finally for a more active fund like ARKK it is 0.75%.  That fee is taken out of the fund every year to run the fund and make the company a profit.  You can even find funds with expense ratios over a full percent.

03/23/2021,stocks,Index funds and indexing ETFs cost more than holding individual shares long term due to the churn produced by fund resizing and rebalancing and due to running costs (even when most operations of the fund are automated). That's the price you pay for easy diversification. It's less than the cost you pay for the administration and management of a mutual fund but more than the cost of buying and holding individual shares. Buffet's remarks were about the brokerage fees that you pay when actively trading shares and not about a strategy of buy and hold applied to individual shares.

This sent Intel shares on a rocket in after hours trading.

03/23/2021,stocks,I agree to an extent but I think it kinda depends what you're doing. If you're day trading to flip stocks it seems like price action and technical analysis is imperative. I have a mix of long/medium term holds (investments) based on my DD that I don't bother doing a lot of TA with most of the time. But then I also buy dips and sell for profit with other stocks. This is where I'd like to be taught by someone who really knows what they're doing w/ regards to TA.
03/23/2021,stocks,"Thanks, will do!"
03/23/2021,stocks,"From what I understand, most day traders don't make money, or there's very few who make profits. 

Yes, it seems like technical analysis is imperative to day trading to flip stocks, but ultimately, you never really know if you're buying at a peak even if the indicators are telling you that the price will continue to rise. I'm a real pessimist when it comes to TA, so take what I'm telling you with a grain of salt. 

So its not just negativity I'm sending your way, I was listening to the audiobook of Technical Analysis for Dummies. There was some information I liked (and it sounded good as I listened to it). But like I stated above, the author was constantly talking about how nothing was inherently reliable, so I was turned off. You may feel different. Best of luck."

Pretty much every Xbox Series X manufactured has been sold, and Microsoft has a key advantage in Game Pass which is a very lucrative way to continuously monetize their Xbox and PC gaming. It also has some serious IP (between Bethesda and all their games,  Minecraft, Halo, and many more). The key is Microsoft profits from gamers on both PC and Xbox.

03/23/2021,stocks,"I’m a MSFT bull. I feel like they have still a lot of room to grow in long term with Azure and LinkedIn like you said. I think you have underrated the Xbox and gaming segment. They have seen more growth than LinkedIn in the most recent quarter when looking at yoy growth.

Also you are under estimating the Office 365 segment in my opinion. **It hasn’t never been about consumer, it’s been about the 365 commercial and providing it to other businesses.** Office 365 is super popular in a work environment and they hold a strong market there. Don’t see anyone cutting their market share significantly. Their revenue growth has been very good in the Office 365 consumer segment. 

Microsoft’s balance sheet is also a thing that impresses me alot. Their credit rating is AAA, the highest possible (which is very rare) and their huge cash holdings can cover all of their  long term debt.

One other factor that you didn’t take in count is their management. Satya Nadella is a very intelligent person who has turned Microsoft entirely. He has been there since the 90s and know the ins and outs of the business.

So with these factors and the possible acquiry of Discord with also the boat load of cash, I sense more value in Microsoft than you do."

Regarding Xbox, I would like to see you expound on their position compared to Playstation. My understanding is that MS has moved beyond just consoles, arrogantly claiming they aren't in the same industry anymore, and are building a Netflix-like game subscription service in their GamePass Ultimate. Many of these games offer cross-platform capabilities between Xbox, PC, or even mobile with the Xcloud technology. I also saw articles today that MS is looking to acquire Discord, a multiplatform voice and text chat software, for $10bn. I get the impression MS is willing to put an Xbox app on the Playstation console if Sony will allow it.

I will acknowledge that historically Playstation has led the console wars with a more expansive selection of exclusive AAA titles. Microsoft's acquisition of Zenimax Studios was just made official and brings in a significant selection of AAA intellectual property. Zenimax seems to be the capstone on a buying spree of studios over the last two years. It seems like Xbox has already positioned itself to give Playstation a run for its money in the near future.

03/23/2021,stocks,"Thank you for putting this together. If $MSFT is not your long term investment destination, which would be out of the rest of the FANG growth basket of $FB, $AMZN, $NFLX, $GOOGL, $AAPL ?"
03/23/2021,stocks,"> Microsoft currently has a net margin of 33.47%, the highest it's been in more than 15 years (how far back my data goes). This margin compares well with Apple's 21.73%, Amazon's 5.53%, Netflix's 11.05%, and Google's 22.06%. The only FAANG company that has a higher margin than Microsoft is Facebook with a 33.90% margin. Seeing as Facebook operates as a software company only, I'm not surprised.

I don't think netflix should be in this crowd , even tho it's FAANG, it's a younger company (comparably) and it's expected to reinvest more money into the company. 

This is a pretty interesting take tho since most technology companies opt for reinvesting money into R&D or something. This is telling me FB and MSFT are gearings towards buying out their competition moreso than rapidly developing in house things. I feel like this is probably the right move (msfts track record of companies it basically buys is pretty solid)."
03/23/2021,stocks,I'm very bullish on Microsoft. The only thing that's going to stop them is antitrust laws
03/23/2021,stocks,Lets not forget that they completely messed up work from home. Microsoft should have been the biggest winner of covid - they bought Skype well before Zoom was even created. This was their moment and they completely blew it. And lets not forget Apple was on the verge of bankruptcy and Microsoft bailed them out in 97 - who bails out their biggest competitor? And its not like they kept the shares to benefit from the run its had. I have very little confidence in them long term.
03/23/2021,stocks,"*If you're a retailer and you're looking to pick a cloud provider, you can't use AWS because you'll be supporting a direct competitor of yours. As a result, many of these companies will end up taking their money to Microsoft. It's also worth noting that the government has shown a preference to use Azure in the past when it comes to military contracts.*

This is a great point. I was wondering why $job uses Azure vs AWS/GCP, because Azure is hot garbage by comparison. It was then explained to me in these terms and it makes total sense.  Its not a technical decision and isnt for many other businesses.  Its not even that we give a shit, but our customers cant do business with suppliers who run on Amazon."

03/23/2021,stocks,"Why on earth would they want PLUG? Hydrogen is far from proven and even further from dominant - i.e entirely out of MSFT MO.

MSFT acquiring Discord and Tiktok I can get, both leaders in their field but MSFT isn't a moonshot company. They take tried and true methods and extract maximum possible profit."
03/23/2021,stocks,Cant forget the Bethesda acquisition
03/23/2021,stocks,They can’t buy discord if they were to buy tiktok and vice versa I think. Well they can but they won’t
03/23/2021,stocks,I say this selfishly but god I hope Microsoft doesn't buy Discord.
03/23/2021,stocks,"Discord? Let's remember Microsoft bought Skype when it was hot and turned it into trash. 



Tiktok? You're dreaming, no way ever MS would be allowed to buy it...it's a to big platform to sell out to MS. Also...Chinese.



Plug? Sure they can buy it but it seems like a very bad buy imo, no moat/easy to copy and hydrogen is simply lackluster. Unless you want terrorism made easy, then its a great idea...High explosive hydrogen tanks everywhere!




Let's look at real numbers. Azure is big business, Teams is big business and *Office* is a big time cash cow. Gamepass isn't even pocket change in comparison...and is not even a thing on mobiles where most revenue is made. Gamepass is OK, but far from worth being called even a 10th leg of MS revenue (also, litterary anyone can and will copy it. Its the Netflix situation all over again)"
03/23/2021,stocks,"Zenimax isnt the capstone of their buying spree of gaming companies, Satya Nadella has even said they will consider buying more gaming companies in the future. 

I expect they will acquire another publisher or two with a combined value of ~10B to increase first party content production for game pass.

Right now they have enough studios and teams to release atleast a first party game per quarter once they all get going, I think they want a first party game ever ~6 weeks on average, and to do that they need more talent. It makes sense to acquire heavily now before another competitor to game pass gets a foothold and increases any content licensing prices to a point that is unsustainable. Plus it takes popular IPs off the table that a competitor could use to jump start their service.

To use an analogy, right now microsoft wants to ensure that another company doesnt pull a Disney, Disney in ~2010 ish, buying well known IP and content companies, like Marvel, Star Wars, and Fox, all with the intent of starting their own streaming service to rival netflix. In this analogy Microsoft is like netflix buying lucasfilm with the backing of a multi-trillion dollar corporation. 

If they keep acquiring at the rate they are it will make it impossible for the Amazons of the world to make a credible competitor to game pass, most of the big IPs and exciting new games will be on game pass and not whatever amazons service is called"
03/23/2021,stocks,"Microsoft still spend a ton on R&D, usually spending ~20B annually on it, they are just big and cash rich enough that they can do both strategies and acquire where it makes sense"
03/23/2021,stocks,"I can’t see a scenario we’re MSFT gets hit with anti-trust. I love the company, but I don’t love the price it’s at."
03/23/2021,stocks,"No way. With everyone working from home O365 is healthier than ever. What Zoom can do is a very small piece of what MS offers.

You know who bails out a competitor? A company that isn't going to get broken up with anti trust litigation

Nadella has been finding every way to feed the real beast, Azure. AWS is solid competition but MS has been building Azure in a way that will be fantastic long term. They will own gaming. They even got Sony on board for it's cloud infrastructure.

If all you see is Zoom as a misstep, you're extremely myopic."

Discord already has a big user base and as you noted integration with Xbox will help them push back against PS."
03/23/2021,stocks,"I was thinking they could be acquiring it to compete with that other up and coming social media app, clubhouse.  also they would probably monetize the shit out of it.

despite it's original audience of gamers its expanded outside of that with other users creating channels more tailored to hobbies and interests.  for example like a crypto investors channel and I just joined one that's for nba top shot.  it's also helped a bunch of individual gaming streamers and youtubers build their own communities by having their own channel.

they ain't just gonna spend 10 billion just for an app they can integrate with xbox lol

03/23/2021,stocks,we may just be different investors. What are some of your favorite stocks that you hold currently?
03/23/2021,stocks,"Been holding Boeing since $120, GE since $6, MSFT since $172, and LMT since $325."
03/23/2021,stocks,"My big holdings are apple, Microsoft (biggest), VEEV, MA and V. The other 80% of my trading portfolio are etfs."
03/23/2021,stocks,One of my first trades ever was buying VEEV at $74 and selling at $250. I still feel an attachment to them to this day.
03/23/2021,stocks,"Well, you bought before or during a correction that affected most of the sectors and stocks that rallyed weeks and months before. However, this happens and it will probably happen to you many more times. 

It also happened to me, when I bought some stocks in February 2020, just to see them crash like 40-60% a few weeks later lol. I didn't sell them and even added to some positions and now, most of them (except for one, I think) are in the green.

I think if you bought these stocks for the long run, which to me it sounds you did, you shouldn't focus too much on short term movements, because in general: time in the market beats timing the market. If you have some more money to invest, you could think about adding to your positions. If not, just hold."
03/23/2021,stocks,"I think the consensus is most stocks are overpriced right now. There will probably be a correction and prices will go down. That could be a good time to buy. Some stocks are probably resilient to a correction, in the sense that they have good financials and are too vital to daily life to not recover. Personally, I see Apple, Google, Amazon, and CocaCola this way. ETF’s and Index funds can be good bets for stability. I don’t short sell, I just by commodities and sell when it seems like a good idea. This is not financial advice, just my take based on a few years of trading."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Buy something you believe in, like or familiar with so the price drops won’t matter. 

Warren buffet never flinched and he’s been through a lot of different scenarios. If you believe in the company or sector the money will come"
03/23/2021,stocks,Just dump it all into VTI and add money to it every months.
03/23/2021,stocks,"Means you probably bought at a high point. To improve evaluate your decision at that time.  Did you buy in too esrly during pre-market?  Off a hype? Did you feel FOMO? Did you do enough dd to justify ur entry point? Maybe you just got caught up in the slump with increasing bond yields that screwed over tech atm. Gotta figure out what you did wrong to make your self bwtter. 

I would hold all share purchases if you feel the company is going to improve over time. No reason to sell if the reason you bought in hasnt changed significantly."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Sounds to me like you're confusing investing with trading. With investing you might DCA over time and hold long-term (years). If you bought at all-time highs and are panicking 3 months later then you probably want to be a trader, in which case you should be looking for momentum over growth. If you really want to be a long-term investor and you have done solid DD on solid companies that you understand then hold and DCA over the coming years. If you can't handle the shorter-term gyrations then it's probably best to cash out and go back to the drawing board and figure out what's going to work for you."
03/23/2021,stocks,I think everyone’s in the red today except Amazon . If you have good stocks that you believe in then hold.
03/23/2021,stocks,"Hey, 

I like many others, are in the same boat as you. I've personally lost 33% since I began in late January. 

I didn't fall too hard into GME, but as a Reddit lurker, it is what got me interested (through RH, no less). I've since move to M1 and have been enjoying that, so I'd say you're on the right track going with Fidelity. 

The thing I've been told and is important to remember is why you started investing in the first place. If it was to make money off the GME craze, then I guess we're all finding out it's not that easy. Plus there's plenty of other, more straight-forward ways of gambling money away. I myself live in Michigan and simply CANNOT. GET. ENOUGH. of the MGM/Draftkings/Fanduel ads. 

Likewise, whether or not you want to keep your current postions may be a matter of why you entered them to begin with. If it was a gamble, maybe it's time to chalk it up as ""Market Tuition"". 

But if you entereded the market and your positions bc you wanted to invest long term, then try as hard as you can to not sweat the red. View this as an opportunity to establish a healthy amount in your account before the market begins to grow organically. Over enough time, this has always been the case. 

In my head, as an eternal pessimist, I know that had I entered the market and it immediately went up, I'd be bummed that I wasn't able to put more in, and missed the train, so-to speak. I'd be afriad that future allocations would have been made ""past the prime"". At least this way, I know I'm building a base and awaiting better days. 

Hope everything starts to turn around for you. Hopefully this time next year, we'll all be in a much better position."
03/23/2021,stocks,Some of the best day traders and swing traders are red in the month of March. It will pick back up. That is if the Fed and our ever so gracious president don’t f@&k it up. This country needs to open back up in full swing. Bottom line.
03/23/2021,stocks,"Oh man yeah if I thought this might be a bad time to buy you take the cake!  But instead of liquidating you held and are better now?

Time in the market beats timing the market.  I really like that."
03/23/2021,stocks,"So it was a bad time to get in the market basically?

And since I'm so new I'm not really trying to buy low and sell high, just buy low and hold.  Is that a thing?"
03/23/2021,stocks,I've got BRKB because that dude knows what he's doing.  So like something I believe in would be a company I'm already familiar with in the real world and like?  I'm sorry I feel like I sound like I'm 5 lol.
03/23/2021,stocks,Buffet never bought overvalued stocks though. He is a value investor.

03/23/2021,stocks,"Thats the thing nothing has changes why I've bought the stocks except for their dip.  Except for GE, still not sure what I should do with their stocks."
03/23/2021,stocks,It's not just today I've been in the red. I've been in it for a month and I'm down like 5%.  Is that normal sometimes?  So sorry if that is just like the dumbest question.
03/23/2021,stocks,"Lol are you me? I live in Michigan and have been heavy into MGM/Draftkings/Fanduel lol.  The stocks I bought I bought because I thought those sectors are bound for growth long term, and as far as the research I did on those specific companies they seemed like solid picks (SEEMED being the operative word, that's why I wonder if I should dump.  Just make a bad pick or something).  But yeah you're right, now is not a bad time to get a decent amount into my portfolio while it's down.  I like that.

Any suggestions on stocks or etfs that you like I could do my own research on?"
03/23/2021,stocks,"Yeah man, I held and even added to some positions, which are up in the double digits now.

Things that I learnt from the COVID crash in March 2020 are that you really shouldn't make any decisions due to fear and greed. That's mostly referring to panic selling on the one hand and buying due to FOMO (fear of missing out) on the other hand; because, trust me, there are always some other good opportunities in the market. But if you, for example, really want to open up a position in a stock that rallyed a lot, I'd always recommend DCAing into that stock.

Also, I can recommend to not look into your account too often during volatile times. That helped me a lot during Feb-April 2020 lol."
03/23/2021,stocks,I’m not sure. I know I’ll stay in it. There’s still undervalued stocks and newer companies have a lot of upside. I’m curious what others on here thinks.
03/23/2021,stocks,"No I wouldn’t say it was a bad time to get into the market - yes in hindsight you bought at the peak, but obviously if we could all see the future we’d just buy PowerBall numbers lol. And although people were saying stocks were overpriced in Feb/March, they were also saying that last August - or even last April after the crash.

So as others have said, if you’ve bought companies you believe in long term then I would just hold and not get too focused on the day to day movements. If anything, if prices keep dipping but you feel the company is sound in the long-term - then take advantage and buy more and hold."
03/23/2021,stocks,The treasuries yield curve has been steepening markedly since February since 10yr treasuries have been selling off and this might continue for a while. This is what pushed the stock price of most risky companies down.
03/23/2021,stocks,Yeah something like that. It’s up to you though I’m not going to list companies because I’m not qualified. GL
03/23/2021,stocks,"Follow Buffet's advice and learn about value investing. Learn to read 10-K and 10-Q filings of any company that you are thinking to invest in and learn about accounting so you can understand their financial statements and how to value a company. Do not buy a company whose operations, industry and finances you haven't studied and you don't understand. It's not enough to buy good companies, you also have to buy them when they are cheap. For this you need to learn how to estimate their intrinsic value but be aware that good buying opportunities are rare."
03/23/2021,stocks,Buffet is a genius in his own way
03/23/2021,stocks,yes
03/23/2021,stocks,"If nothing has changed to make you think its a bad company, then just hold. The markets can be irrational at times. I had to hold all my bags when covid hit. No reason to sell.  Took about a year before i could sell at even and invest elsewhere."
03/23/2021,stocks,The market has been bleeding for a month now I suggest to add to your position since prices are really low now
03/23/2021,stocks,"Man I got in around feb 15, and I’m the same. However check the charts of every stock, and they usually peaked there and went downwards. It was just bad timing, if you believe in the stocks you chose continue. My only suggestion is try picking some value stocks for the times ahead"
03/23/2021,stocks,"Haha perhaps I should have included the /s tag after the ads. But no bullshit, if you're a believer in their product/industry, check out BETZ

I am almost exclusively in ETFs now and primarily use ETFdb.com as a source. 

I'd start with a particular issuer like Vangaurd, and look at some of their different large indexes...VTI, VT, VOO, VXUS to start, then down the cap spectrum... VO/VB. 

Themetically, I would go with conviction on what you believe will be the future. Sounds stupid, but we're all shooting in the dark. Lotta people, myself included like the ARK funds because they're actively managed by an individual. For this, you'll pay a higher premium, but I personally think it's worth it. 

Other themetics I like are: BLOK, SOXX, MOON, MSOS, PAVE, ICLN, LIT, DRIV, CIBR, CLOU, HERO, and QQQJ

For large sectors (Industrials, Pharma, Financials, etc) I'd recommend just starting with one issuer and look at their selection. The large issuers all have some variation of the same major sector ETFs. VFH, XLF, and IYF, for example.

EDIT: Edit to add that if you look up an issuer like Global X, who has 70-some ETFs, you can get a good idea of all the thematic ETFs out there."
03/23/2021,stocks,It has stabilised this past couple of days and there has still been red everywhere tbf. I think we’re going to see the market trade sideways for a couple more months. These inflation worries keep cropping up.

03/23/2021,stocks,"Ok cool.

03/23/2021,stocks,"I know it's hard to suggest value stocks for the times ahead, but any suggestions on how I could find those? Lol I feel like the only way to find a company to invest in is to already know the company."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Imo the bubble in risky tech companies has popped and those will only go lower (with the usual oscillations).

It's hard for me to predict what the US market will do as a whole, but what I see is that there are increased inflows from retail investors (who  generally double down on ARK invest holdings and other risky fare) and increased outflows and rebalancing by institutional investors (who run away from those risky assets faster than retail is doubling down on them). 

Investment funds are moving more and more into international value markets, where the smart money has been since December."
03/23/2021,stocks,For me I only add to the stocks I believe in the most perhaps even sell other stocks to buy more of this particular stock. This is ofcourse different for everyone... now I don’t know where you are invested in but if you don’t believe in the companies your invested in right now you should probably look for different companies (not financial advice).
03/23/2021,stocks,"I usually find good picks in r/investing, also some investopedia suggestions are real good (it was talking about danaos a few months back and f me I didn’t buy), also zacks is fine I think.

03/23/2021,stocks,"You see, if it goes to far up it’ll eventually pass 800, but if it continues to go down it’ll eventually pass 500. Simple economics."
03/23/2021,stocks,"That's partly why they do work.

Certain patterns have been shown to correlate with certain price moves.  No pattern is a guarantee.  But some patterns are more likely to lead to certain outcomes.

Moving averages are the most widely known and basic element of technical analysis.  The reason why so many investors and traders use them is because so many investors and traders use them.  And that makes them effective tools.  Let's take a simple example: suppose you look at a yearly chart of a particular stock and you notice that 3 times over the past year the stock has pulled back to the 50 day MA and then bounced off and resumed its uptrend. Now the stock is in a short term downtrend and is approaching the 50 DMA.  A lot of people out there in the world notice the same thing you did and will be watching, planning to enter a buy order around the 50 DMA.  The 50 DMA then becomes a demand level for the stock, increasing the likelihood that the stock will bounce off again and continue upwards."

I’ve noticed twice recently that after I’ve sold some (but not all) shares of a company that my average buy in has changed.

I sold 170 shares of something just yesterday at €2.04 for a 1.4% loss, so my average buy in at was €2.08 or so.

Now today I still have 400 shares and it says my buy in is €1.85 and I’m 7% up overall. what??!

I averaged my way in i.e. so I bought chunks of shares at different prices, but I thought my costs should all just be averaged and when you sell some it should keep the same average? or is my broker for some reason selling the more expensive ones first?? 
any explanation appreciated."

03/23/2021,stocks,Most brokers (at least in the US) sell First In First Out so if your first shares were the most expensive that would explain it.  You then have a realized gain/loss on those shares for tax reasons.  Average price is just to let you have an idea on what your gain/loss would be if you sold out of your whole position but (again in the US) your actual realized gain/loss is tied to the shares you actually sold.

As most of you know, Tesla has sold just under 500,000 cars in 2020, which is in line with its overly ambitious goal from 2014.

2021-03-23 18:22:17,stocks,"ADBE - a closer look at alternative data points I’ve been thinking about buying ADBE for a long time and with the stock 15% below its 52-week high (and earnings coming up), this might be a good buying opportunity. So before I made my decision, I decided to look at some [alternative data points](https://dillibits.com/?t=ADBE). This is what I found.

**Not a popular stock on social media**

Adobe is only being mentioned a handful of times per day on social media platforms such as Reddit and StockTwits. But the bullish sentiment is high, currently sitting at 78%.

When it comes to Facebook and Instagram, we can see some minor growth with about 20 new followers per day on Facebook and 320 new followers on Instagram.

**Traffic is going up**

Despite the “low interest” on social media, web traffic for Adobe is significantly up. [Adobe.com](http://adobe.com/) had an estimate of 129M visitors in February, up by almost 20% since September last year.

The Adobe Target product is growing in popularity which could be an indicator of growth for Adobe’s Marketing products.

**Customer Satisfaction remains high**

Adobe's Net Promoter Score (NPS) is sitting at 39 (a good score since [NPS](https://www.comparably.com/brands/adobe#nps) is a grade from -100 to 100) with 60% Promoters, 19% Passives, and 21% Detractors. And that number gets even more impressive when longterm clients are surveyed. Clients that have used Adobe’s products for over 10 years gives the company a 67.

**Increase in patents**

Innovation never sleeps at Adobe, at least not if you’re looking at patent fillings. Just in the last quarter, Adobe has added over 200 patents to their portfolio. Now this is on par with companies such as Oracle and Salesforce, but it’s still an impressive number. Some of their latest [patents](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/browse/?CIK=0000796343) focuses on machine learning and neural networks - lots of cool innovative ideas!

**Workforce is growing and employees are satisfied**

According to their SEC filings in 2013, Adobe had 11k employees. Last year, they reportedly had over 22k employees. Impressive growth, and around the same growth as Apple. And it seems like Adobe is not slowing down. Right now they have 1,464 open positions, up from 294 in mid December last year.

Current employees are also satisfied, the average employee rating is 4.4 (out of 5) which would mean a higher employee satisfaction than Oracle and Microsoft. Adobe’s CEO, Shantanu Narayen, is getting stellar reviews from the employees, 4.9 out of 5.

The stock might a bit expensive relative to competitors and current earnings, but based on the data, and with [ESG](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ADBE/sustainability/) Risk ratings being low and revenue almost doubling in the last four years, I think Adobe has a lot more room to grow and so I add the stock to my portfolio this morning.

Note: This is not financial advice. Do your own DD.

2021-03-23 18:22:05,stocks,"Thoughts on European telecom diversification plays VOD and DTEGY So this is going to serve as a bit of DD and Discussion but I’m wanting to hear others opinions on these companies and hear what y’all’s outlooks are on them vs mine. 

So first up is Vodafone Group PLC (VOD); a company that pays semiannual dividends with a 5.7% yield, a current price around $18.65, a PT between $22.60-$25.48, an average PT of $24.04 and a P/B ratio of only .76. Looking at these numbers alone it seems like VOD is undervalued and when you look at their expansion into Africa and India as well as cementing their status as Europe’s discount cell service for all backpackers/tourists/Americans stationed overseas (they actually have contracts with the US military to sell their phones and chips directly to Americans on base in the military’s PX’s and BX’s)/students studying abroad you can see how qualitatively they also have a lot going for them. Personally I’m looking to begin dollar cost averaging in to VOD as I find both their yield and growth prospects attractive. Not to mention I used them while I was living in Germany and so did every single kid in my school. 

The second company I would like to discuss with y’all is Deutsche Telekom (DTE.DE) or for those of us in the states (DTEGY). DTEGY pays only a yearly dividend with a 3.47% yield and trades around $19.65 with a PT range between $15.53-$29.82, an average TP of $23.85 and a much more average P/B ratio of 2.16. While these numbers aren’t as great as VOD it is still the largest telecommunication provider in all of Europe, and also owns like 45% of T-mobile so they are getting a large amount of revenue from America’s 3rd largest cellular network. While I haven’t found anything on them expanding into emerging markets I have seen their recent huge investments into 5G and how they are making moves to solidify their 5G network to maintain their largest in Europe status. 

So do y’all have any thoughts on VOD and DTEGY? Personally I’m going to be buying a few shares of both and just watch how 5G continues to roll out. I also like them as they offer me some international exposure and diversification. Personally I hate AT&T due to dealing with them for years as a customer and as such don’t want to invest in them but still want some more communication sector diversification outside of VZ and DIS that still pays a decent dividend.

I simply am wanting to start a conversation over two stocks I am personally interested in buying and the price points I used are from several brokerages such as Schwab and RobinHood and investment websites like yahoo finance and cnn finance.

2021-03-23 18:11:35,stocks,"When to get out I've been in the market since the end of January, meme stocks got me interested but I realized at that point I was more likely to lose money than make it buying them. Some of the stocks I've bought over the past almost two months have hit either 52wk, or all time, highs. Some climbing over 10% during that time. 

If the stock's growth was largely the result of the market as a whole going up during that time, as opposed to being propelled by its own merits, would I be better to get out or to hold? 

For example, one of them, MUFG, is a Japanese bank that is just over $5.80 a share. Aside from a day where it eclipsed the $6 mark last week it hasn't been this high since 2018 (on anything resembling a consistent basis). They do pay a decent dividend, and have been fairly consistent, but without much room for growth it doesn't seem that holding makes much sense. 

Without any news or rumors indicating room for potential growth of the company, my thought is sell before my gains slowly slip away and out the money into something with the potential for more immediate growth. 

I've gotten fairly decent about knowing when to get in, admittedly I bought MUFG when I didn't know and got lucky, I'm still not great at knowing when to get out. Obviously if something is tanking and news comes out that's not going to change, that's easy. I struggle with determining when to get out when I'm up. 

Are my thoughts on it looking like there's no room for additional growth right? 

I'm trying not to make decisions based on emotions, but I also need a better grasp of prevailing logic to do that. I'm sure there are indicators that make long term become short term, short term become swing stocks, and swing stocks become bad ideas."

If the share price rises above the intrinsic value per share that you get then it makes sense to sell. Now this only makes sense to do a DCF if you fully understand the company otherwise it can give you confidence in the wrong numbers.

If it's hugely below then it makes sense to buy (margin of safety).

I like Prof. Aswath Damodaran's spreadsheets the best for this. You can use his spreadsheet here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9GfXJ-IrSA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9GfXJ-IrSA)

Generally the fed goes to great lengths to be as forthright and predictable as possible, because they are *extremely* aware of their influence.  So, usually the Fed tells the market what the market expects to hear, and the market is unaffected, because they were already expecting it.

What I can't make sense of today is that JPow is telling the market exactly what it expects to hear, and the market is reacting like the fed is pulling the rug out from under them.

EDIT: After poking around a bit, I think todays drop has less to do with JPow and more to do with parts of the E.U. going into lockdown and the U.S./Europe imposing sanctions on China.

I get that, but that hasn't changed in 3 weeks now.  Macro market shocks come when future expectations suddenly shift.

Up until now, we've seen evidence of changing expectations in the form of rising treasuries.  But, the 10 year treasury is actually down today."
03/23/2021,stocks,"It seems that the institutional investors have made their mind so to speak. They expect higher inflation later this year (seriously above 2%), which is why they think that the 10yr treasuries yield will eventually increase above 2%, making risky securities less valuable.

So they'll keep moving into safer bets as well as into cash and international investments, since there are still a few reasonably priced opportunities abroad (if you look at small/medium cap and value). Many mutual and hedge funds use global macroeconomic analysis as one factor in their asset allocation.

The party in overpriced tech companies seems to be over as far as they are concerned."
03/23/2021,stocks,"> They expect higher inflation later this year (seriously above 2%)

I realize, but the market has already adjusted to that.  Market shocks come when expectations *change*.  The 10-year treasury is actually slightly down today, so that suggests that the markets inflation expectations have not shifted today (and therefore that inflation expectations are not the cause of todays sell-off)."
03/23/2021,stocks,"The market is still over-invested in quite a few risky growth companies in the tech sector (for example, Tesla, SEA, Jumia and others have quite a bit more to fall before they reach fair valuation). Pretty much everything that ARK Invest staked their bets on has more to fall.

The 10year T-note yield is only slightly down, but they are betting that it will go up considerably more in the medium term.

This isn't a sudden shock but a gradual rebalancing of the US stockmarket as well as a gradual flow out of it into cash and international equities which is mainly caused by the gradual steepening of the yield curve.

Moreover, the sheer irrationality on display in meme stocks etc. has convinced most institutional investors that they have to get away from those sectors and increase their diversification away from the US market."
03/23/2021,stocks,"> but they are betting that it will go up considerably more in the medium term.

Again, I realize, but the very fact you're saying this means that it has already been priced into the market.

> This isn't a sudden shock but a gradual rebalancing of the US stockmarket

If you think there's going to be a gradual sell-off in stocks due to interest rates rising, you should sell your whole portfolio now and pile into gold.  But, if that were the best move *everyone would have done it already*.  Of course, eventually stocks would be priced so low they'd be a steal...

You see what I'm saying?  The expectation for rising interest rates has already been priced into the market."

Mate, this statement is a contradiction.  Either the market believes that interest rates are going to rise and they react on that belief, or they're undecided about what will happen with interest rates (i.e. making up their minds).  Can't be both.

Again, I'd say that if you're convinced the change hasn't been priced in already, it's time to sell your portfolio and park in gold.  After the market is done adjusting, you can buy back in at rock-bottom prices.

> Many mutual funds, endowments etc. are rebalancing only now.

If this mattered, the best trading strategy would be to short everything just before the rebalancing, since you already know the adjustment the mutual funds are going to make in advance.

The nimble actors adjust the market *immediately* when expectations change.  The market doesn't wait for mutual funds and endowments to rebalance."
03/23/2021,stocks,"""The market"" is not a single player who acts indivisibly. There are many players with various estimations, opinions and constraints following various strategies and placing different bets. That's why the market can be quite disorderly, inefficient and irrational in the short term -- even though in the long term it tends to correct its estimation of a company toward its intrinsic value. For example retail investors (who represent about 30% of trade volume in the US market at this moment) react differently from institutional investors. By and large *institutional* investors seem to think that inflation and yields will go up later this year; that seems to be only a *majority* opinion among them and not a universal belief. Meanwhile retail seems to be doubling down on risky bets anyway. So you don't have a single uniform and instantaneous reaction as you seem to assume; Mr Market is volatile and quite disjointed.

Your assumption that things somehow magically get ""priced in"" instantaneously and with some sort of magical perfection is naive; that is not how markets work in practice. The process of ""price discovery"" is rather complex and bumpy and tends to take a while. For example, as a mutual fund manager you have to come up with some high confidence estimate of future T-bill yields before making a quantitative decision on how precisely to re-balance the portfolio you manage (in order to compute the new percentage allocations).

You may be unaware of the fact that many investment funds are disallowed by law (and/or by their own rules) to take leveraged short positions or to use derivative instruments. For example pension funds and most funds in which employers contribute a matching sum are not allowed to short stock or use derivatives. The hedge funds (who are allowed to do that) represent only a minority of the total money under management by institutional investors and they restrict participation to accredited (high net worth) individuals.

Institutional investors are quite varied and operate under different rules, so there is no such thing as an ""institutional investment block"" that acts in a uniform manner and with as much freedom as you seem to assume. When you manage other people's money you are often constrained in the kind of tools you can use and risks you can take and often also in the frequency with which you can place trades.

Hedge funds are usually extremely nimble, as are other specialist trading houses; be sure that they have already reacted and are important contributors to the more violent moves that we have seen in various equities. But they represent only a minority of the market in terms of the total sum under management."
2021-03-23 18:06:59,stocks,"How to know when to give up? Hey guys, I’m really struggling right now. I’ve been at this for about a year now. Truthfully, I don’t think I’ve made a single dollar. And I know that there are going to be a ton of people saying *”Well, I blew my account x number of times...”

That’s not what this is about. Losing money sucks, yes, but it’s really about the complete lack of progress that I’ve made up to this point. Simple question: how do you know when someone’s not cut out for trading on the market?"
03/23/2021,stocks,your not alone. i feel the same exact way
03/23/2021,stocks,You’re telling me you haven’t made a single profit this year after one of the craziest runs in the stock market ever?
03/23/2021,stocks,"Switch to long term investing. Timing the market is extremely difficult. It took me 3 years of studying the market before I started swing trading for consistent profits. Treat your moves like a business, not a casino. It will take longer than 1 year and will be difficult. Nothing worth doing is easy. Stick in there & alter your strategies a bit for less risk. Improve in DD and the areas you feel you lack in. It doesn't come overnight"

03/23/2021,stocks,"Stop gambling and start investing. Don’t think of it as a bet on random price fluctuations and think of it as literal ownership of a company you believe in. Ignore the hype investments (GME, TSLA, BTC)—too much noise and risk. Look up dollar cost averaging and just dump a % of each paycheck into VOO or other ETFs that have good US exposure and get rich slowly without any effort or time spent researching. This method will net you better returns than 99% of trader’s portfolios. And never sell unless you need to rebalance your portfolio (4x a year MAX) or you’re retiring. There’s a reason most people’s 401ks outperform their active investment accounts—we’re all flawed human idiots who make bad decisions. Take the decision making out of it as much as possible."
03/23/2021,stocks,"I’d recommend someone to quit once they start asking about giving up. With that frame of mind, you’re bound to lose more over the long run. The hard part is deciding on taking an “L” now and being done with it, or walk away and periodically check how you’re doing. I’d personally go with the latter."
03/23/2021,stocks,"You don't ""give up"".

You learn and change your strategies.

If you are doing something and it doesn't work for you, stop.

Day trading and stock picking is not for everyone. Stop fucking around.

If you go buy QQQ, VOO and SMH right now, I am telling you that you will make money for sure.

Don't try timing it. Just buy it 30-120 minutes before close on a Friday every month or bi-weekly, with whatever extra amount you have from each pay cheque.

There is about a 98% chance they will be significantly higher in 2030.

The paper chasing gets exhausting, especially when you’re not rolling in dough.

03/23/2021,stocks,Buy hold and forget. You will rarely lose if you do this.
03/23/2021,stocks,"My only guess as to why you havent made money is
1) option plays 
2) buying meme stocks at the peaks of hype
3) buying normal stocks at the peaks due to fomo

If 1 and 2 are the reasons then maybe stocks arent for you

If 3 is the reason then you have nothing to worry about as long as you just wait. For example, even if i bought appl at 145, i wouldnt be worried. It will be 175 within 12 to 18 months. 

My best advice is to get your money ready and buy spy on red days, eventually youll make a profit and then you can apply patience to individual stocks."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Part of it is accepting that you personally made the mistake. Allow me to explain, this isnt meant as hurtful criticism but rather you have to understand that you werent ""betrayed"" or ""misled"" or ""just got bad luck"" when trades or buys go wrong. You have to accept you personally did something wrong by not accommodating your decisions to the market.

If you bought a stock thats on a clearly established downtrend because you ""felt good"" or thought it would go up without any kind of supporting hypothesis, even on weak evidence, then you personally did something wrong there, its not the market didnt agree. 

If you bought something at the top of its all time high, thats a mistake that you personally made, not bad luck or a shift in the market or something. You can wait for a pullback that always comes and DCA either down or up to lower your risk.

If you really like the idea and story behind a stock or company and get emotionally invested in owning it and ignore the valuation, or volatility, or potential catalysts, then thats something you personally are doing wrong and have control over. 

You have to be a surfer and ride the waves. You will make smarter decisions and make money but you have to take ownership entirely of what you do. Start by reading all the beginner shit here

Are you jumping on trendy stocks that have already had significant/overvalued gains? Or are you doing your own DD?

The best lesson Ive learned and the one that got me to stop piling in on stocks that are pumping is this. When you see it on the news it’s too late to get in on. That has served me well. Also don’t mess with options if you’re struggling to understand market mechanics. Don’t focus on what you could have done. Rather try to focus on what you can do. You have to learn to let go of loss. Everyday won’t be green. Some days will be blood red. The probability of you making money as an inexperienced trader actively trading is much lower than you making money holding.

You could have thrown it on VOO and gotten insane growth.   


But to answer your question when someone isn't cut out for trading on the stock market is when they aren't consistently beating the SP500. And I don't mean every year you are falling short and then one year you beat it by 2%...if you can't beat that consistently you might as well drop the stress and just invest in VOO or VOOG if you wanna be a little riskier."

If you're just putting in a little bit from each paycheck then I think you'll be pretty OK, that's true.  But I caution against this kind of thinking because someone might want to throw their life savings into QQQ without really knowing what they're getting into.

Not much thought, it’s about the strategy. Basically I look for base builds, which is strong points of resistance on the daily or hourly. I pick some that are near particular points, wait for market open, once those stocks clear those points, I buy a weekly call and ride the wave. The trades last usually a minute, some times seconds. I don’t care if the ticker I’m trading on is poised to do good for the next week/month/years because I’m only holding for a few minutes.

And don’t mess with options unless you know what you’re doing. Even then."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Are you chasing gains? Or are you holding individual companies?

In almost every single case, chasing gains will result in losing money. Buy something you believe in and hold it. Whether it's travel, cannabis, war, technology, healthcare. Just buy something sound and stable, and hold. 

Hold for years. That's the *best* way to maximize the probability of you making money. It's a game of patience."

03/23/2021,stocks,"That’s your problem. Fast money goes both ways. Are you trying to invest or gamble?

03/23/2021,stocks,"I see, personally i never touch options so maybe my style of investing might differ from yours. But i still believe giving up on the market as a whole just because you dabbled in options is not a wise decision. But its your money and life so you make the final call."
03/23/2021,stocks,"You arent structuring your trades or basing them off any kind of strategy most likely.

If you want to buy something that's undervalued to swing trade it then first read the charts and news, is it on a down trend? Did it bottom out? What are the support and resistance levels? Why is this stock going to go up? Is there a catalyst that's going to drive buying pressure up soon? Is it undervalued and under-bought and therefore worth holding to swing? Pretend like you're a lawyer or advisor trying to sell someone on this trade. Dont buy something thats on the way down, wait untill it consolidates around a share price that it find buying support around and can build up, then buy it on the upward trend and try to figure out how far it can run and sell accordingly. Buying and holding is a legit strategy as long as you understand what you want to do, and if you dont know what to do that in itself is information, find out what you want, what your goal is, risk tolerance, etc. Always dollar cost average everything, dont realize losses unless there is a clear and present better opportunity. Don't fomo late into the top of a run. Good luck."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Because it is. Regardless, you can just put it in an index fund if you don’t believe you can outperform the market."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Sounds to me more like you are inpatient. This stuff isn't that easy and it seems to me you dabble with one thing and if you don't immediately get it you move on. Problem is, moving on from the very basics just introduces more complex ideas, and more risk. 

Get back to the basics. stop thinking about options, swing trading, day trading, or scalping for now, because honestly you are going to fail at all of the above if you do not understand how to evaluate stocks or understand factors that move markets. without a solid base, all you are doing is throwing darts at a board, or worse, just logging on to reddit to find a ticker and buying it with no understanding of why. 

learn what P/Es are, EPS and their derivatives are, for now stick with stocks that are have positive financials, are generating revenue and look to be growing. Use these factors to screen stocks using one of dozens of stock screeners out there to try and find undervalued stocks in some area that you actually know something about. find 10 or so tickers and google them all, look for positive news, look for momentum, look to see if they are either top of their game, or have real chance of growing. what is their market share? what are their products, what new products are they teasing? what do people think of their products or services?

What is their debt? is it manageable?

Things like that. You aren't always going to win, but going through these careful steps is going to increase your odds.  Make a decision on what you want. profit? how much and how much is reasonable for the stock? 10%, 20%? to the moon?!?!? also consider how much loss you are willing to absorb. Then buy and sit on it, don't do anything until your buy or sell conditions are hit. maybe it takes a week, maybe months, maybe years...

and then, win or lose, always try to figure out what happened and what lesson you can take from it. Apply that to your next trade."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Options are a much easier way to blow up your account. not only do you have to be right about the stock, you have to be right about the timing, anything but leaps are mostly gambling. forget about those for a while. 

buy and hold shares you can keep with conviction for a long time. Which companies are going to be the leaders in the next age? You need stuff you truly believe in. And remember most retail traders best performing accounts are old accounts they completely forgot about, and got left alone for several years lol"
03/23/2021,stocks,"When I first started I didn't know what to do, about 5yrs ago. I kept visiting sub-reddits and learning from other users. Really didn't starting Investing wisely and caring about my financial future until about 3yrs ago. I've lost more money then I Have earned from doing dumb stuff in the market, until recently. Once I really did research on companies, it was easy to make money. I started off with Dividends, well because they pay you and that's what I wanted out of the market, more money. That helped fix the itch of earning, once I understood that and had a comfortable position in those, I moved to growth stocks(Simply wallstreet helped with that, App). Once I did that, I would follow a simple process to check the sentiment. from these sites (ETF-Channel->FinViz-> Trading-view->Chartmill-). If they all looked good on the sites above I bought"
03/23/2021,stocks,If you don’t have a goal or a plan then it’s no wonder you’re frustrated and not seeing progress. Think about how many people lost their ass compared to how many warren Buffett’s there are. If you want to invest in stocks and have a good life. Pick 3 investments and go to school for a trade.
03/23/2021,stocks,"What did you go to school for? Did you graduate? I started at devry and didn’t finish and it was so expensive and I couldn’t get help online. Student loans have been the bane of my adult life. The irony that the one thing I did to better my life haunted me the most was never lost on me. I’ve had my share of legal trouble also. Now I go to a city college for electrical science. I pay my semesters upfront and was able to get a job with a 50 percent pay increase because I’m going to school. Without knowing much about you I’ll tell you this. Don’t continue to do something unsuccessfully to the point you get frustrated and quit. You’re on track with stocks to be in the same place you are emotionally with school. If you refuse to make a plan and exercise discipline in the implementation of it,  you should never expect anything in your life to change."
03/23/2021,stocks,"This might go against the spirit of the sub, but why *not* go to the bank and have them plop your money in a low risk mutual fund? You'll still get better returns than a savings account."
03/23/2021,stocks,"> I’m not going to pay someone to invest for me. I’ll just save my money, as I always have since I started working.

I would strongly reconsider that. Keep in mind $VOO has gone up %20 for a measly 0.03% management expense ratio. https://canadiancouchpotato.com/getting-started/

For some reason, you seem fixated on either going with the most risky, highest failure investment strategy (options) or 0 risk and literally depreciating your money to inflation since savings account get you shit all. 

It seems the market is in a bit of a correction but slowly putting some money into $VOO has been a pretty smart investment strategy for awhile, although things change and nothing is 100% without risk."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Now that's not what I'd recommend. You can make investments. You just shouldn't gamble. Reading some of your comments I see you're playing in options...Yeah...Don't do that anymore. You're clearly not good at That. But you can still invest. Bro I don't have a crystal ball and I'm not a financial expert by any means...there may be a crash coming but it'll go up. Put 250$ a paycheck into and SP500 tracker and when the markets down put 500. It isn't about timing the market like you were trying to do its about time In the market. You could have turned 20k into 20,005$ by playing options over the last year if you're not good at it. But you could have put that 20k into VOO one year ago today and never thought about it again and it'd be worth 35k right now."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Like shares? I’ve got shares for dkng ARKK ARKf and Arkg along with some nndm.

03/23/2021,stocks,I understand
03/23/2021,stocks,That makes sense. I understand
03/23/2021,stocks,"No, not quite. I got three brokers:

ToS was for scalping. Everything’s closed.

WeBull was for, I don’t really know, but I’ve got some long term leap calls that I’ll probably emotionally sell at some point.

And Robinhood is a much of shares and leaps, of which I’m down on pretty much everything. Not really sure what I’m going to do about that."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Nah man.... theirs such a wealth of information out there, and that’s a problem. It’s so tough sorting through all of it and finding something that makes sense to you. Even “beginner” courses I find myself lost"
03/23/2021,stocks,"Well, the only thing that gave me confidence in options was knowing that all of my other finances are sound. My credit score, last I checked, was, like, 800. I was never putting in more than I was willing to lose. 

And, I don’t do stocks because I’m no good at DD. I struggle with speculation because I have no confidence. Options takes the DD and speculation out and leaves it more up to technicalities."
03/23/2021,stocks,Well I’ve been doing options for a while now and I feel a lot more comfortable with those than shares. It just seems to me like you need a ton of capitol to play shares vs. options
03/23/2021,stocks,"I’m trying to pay off my student debt, ideally. Not really sure afterwards. That was my goal when I started this journey."

03/23/2021,stocks,I understand. Thanks
03/23/2021,stocks,Ah I gotcha. Idk.... I’m not very confident in my ability to pick the next best thing
03/23/2021,stocks,I see. Pretty simple
03/23/2021,stocks,"Well, my goal is to pay off my school debt. That’s the goal. 

And no way am I going back to school. That was the WORST mistake I’ve made in my life and I refuse to go back to school— trade or otherwise."
03/23/2021,stocks,"I did not graduate. I went to school for nothing... I had no clue what I wanted to be when I grew older (still don’t) so I took a bunch of random classes, hoping that something would stick and then nothing ever did. And after about 3 years of taking random gen Ed classs, I burned out really hard and gave up. Now I’m 30K in debt, nothing to show for it. Just like stocks!

I dunno man. Sounds to me like I’m just a pathetic excuse for a man. Fuck I’m so frustrated right now."
03/23/2021,stocks,Because then that’s admitting that I truly can’t do this and need some one to hold my hand. I struggle to accept that.
03/23/2021,stocks,What is VOO
03/23/2021,stocks,"I understand. I’m just conflicted, alright? A bruised, fragile ego coming to terms with the fact that the last year of learning options has given me Jack shit. It’s frustrating. 

Maybe I’ll start playing more shares. What’s a good broker for that? I’ve already got 3 going so..."
03/23/2021,stocks,Those are all pretty good positions. Just hold tight for a while. The Ark stocks have been getting rocked these last few months. They’ll rebound.
03/23/2021,stocks,"Stick it all in SPY, VOO or something with long term gains if you’re giving up!"
03/23/2021,stocks,"The oldest shares (and most expensive) I have are 5 years old and worth 200%.  The second oldest just passed a year and is worth 450%.  Be patient friend.

03/23/2021,stocks,I started trading little over a year ago and have lost and won.. before that i read books and have been informing myself for a whole year. Even when i started i wasnt ready. You have to take some L‘s sometimes. Try looking at the bigger stocks and sort out the catalysts that move the stocks sort out the information and write it down
03/23/2021,stocks,"Technicals are way more difficult than DD. You have to compete with algorithms built by a bunch of math PhDs if you want to compete there. Options are also much more reliant on DD than long term buying is. Generally, you want to make a play at least a month out with a catalyst (earnings, announcement, etc). Even then, it may not work out. If all else fails, buying and holding the S&P500 is the easy button for winning in the stock market. Picking long term stocks for +5 years is also much easier."
03/23/2021,stocks,Dude options require way more DD. Any idiot can buy and hold blue-chip stocks/etfs and get decent returns.
03/23/2021,stocks,"Chief just shift everything into a broad market index and move on with your life

It sounds like this is stressing you out, if its seriously stressful its not worth it. Shifting into something like VT or VTI is incredibly safe and diverse, options arent the move for you it sounds like and you mention not being good at DD, a broad market fund (even XEQT or VGRO would be solid) eliminates the DD aspect, you’re essentially buying into a prebuilt and managed portfolio that is diversified as fuck

At least look into it mate, its a better alternative than pulling all your cash out, and its infinitely safer and more stable than anything you could do with options"
03/23/2021,stocks,"Lmao jesus christ you’re such a noob (no offense).

>>And, I don’t do stocks because I’m no good at DD

So what do you do for your options trades? Just pick a ticker and a random strike price/date and just buy and hope it goes up?? 

Newsflash, buying shares doesn’t require you to do extensive DD. I literally did no DD for any of the stocks I bought (other than taking a look at the product and seeing if I like their business) and i’m up almost 100% for the year."
03/23/2021,stocks,That's true but you chance of winning is way higher with shares than options. If your buying a selling options for a year and haven't made a profit you lost money and will have to pay capital gains tax on all trades. If you just put $1000 in an ETF like QQQ you would have doubled your money and not have had to pay taxes on the trade.
03/23/2021,stocks,Have you never heard of fractional shares? you can buy .456 and so on shares in many brokers currently
03/23/2021,stocks,"Market is being moody af over the “potential” increase in bond yield. Higher interest rate + inflation fears = tech company value might now be profitable in the long run if the value of the currency is diluted. Effing A.

Take the capital and save for another day when this storm’s subsided or ride it out."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Look at the company ARKK is holding.. do you have faith that it will rebound? 

The thing i learned is doubts tend to easily creep in during the days where most of the stocks are down.. 

Buy from companies you trust and hold.. There will be days like these and days where it is good.. 

Me im down in arkk too (4%) but im not even thinking about giving up my shares."
03/23/2021,stocks,"there are ways to put your money in the hands of people that do, though. 

You can bet on industry. Think semiconductors are goin to be big? buy the SOXL etf 

Big believer in marijuana being huge one day? MSOS or MJ or YOLO, easy to have a hand in that with these ETFs 

This goes for any industry too 

Even if you can’t pick industries, you can pick institutions you believe in. If you like the way ARK views the future, you can buy into their funds. Maybe you respect the genius of theil Capital? Well they have 2 SPAC funds, BTNB or BTWN. Maybe you think bill ackman has big brain? Then buy PSTH. or you could even be a classic warren buffet boy and buy some fractional in Berkshire. 

Don’t get discouraged, analyze your mistakes, rethink your strategy, and keep learning. we all go through a time early on where we feel down, but don’t let it beat you. If you’re scared of losing more, just do small quantities for now til you start seeing more % gains and feel more confident 

It’s always hardest to hang in there on the red days but you can’t let simple price fluctuations shake your overall long term thesis"
03/23/2021,stocks,Don’t feel sorry for yourself big dog. What you’re going through is something I went through for a long time. The feelings and thoughts you’re having are not indicative of who you are as a man. My problem and what may be yours is an unwillingness to commit. I could never pick a trade or profession because I was too scared of investing and failing. I had fomo if I chose a profession another one would be more successful. My mindset was if you don’t ever commit to something you can’t disappoint anyone or yourself which is safe but never amounts to anything. That’s what I’m talking about... commiting to a plan. Set a goal set a time length and set expectations and evaluate where you are. You can’t measure your progress without something to measure it against. Ask yourself why you miss opportunities to commit... life can never manifest in the way you envision if you’re envisioning 70 different things.

I like etrade. I haven't had any issue with it. OTC is expensive to trade but other than that I'm very happy with the service I get from them. You could follow my strategy. 80% invested in tried and true funds. 20% me seeing if I can beat the experts in individual stocks."
03/23/2021,stocks,"I’m not all options. I have shares. Holding shares is easy but a lot of my shares I kind of blindly walked into owning.

03/23/2021,stocks,I understand. It seems like the reality I’m coming to is the last year I’ve spent learning options have really been for naught. I dunno. I’m really frustrated with that realization.

I had one share of tesla around a year ago that I purchased at, I think $750 pre-split. 

I still think about that..."
03/23/2021,stocks,I understand. Thanks
03/23/2021,stocks,"No, not really. I’ll look for strong base builds, that is a price point that has been rejected ‘x’ number of times on the daily or hourly. Come open, I’ll watch those tickers’ bid asks and once that ticket passes that resistance point by either .05 cents or .50 cents, that’s confirmation of strong buying pressure and I enter. I’ll usually exit a few minutes or even seconds later. It’s a scalping strategy. 

Thanks for the kind words."

And that’s not such a bad strategy. I’m not sure though.... I’m really impatient and that would be a problem with me using that strategy"
03/23/2021,stocks,"Well that's more positive.  I'm a bit afraid I have a gambling problem so have stayed away from them.  I've already gotten a warning for trading too much recently even though my portfolio has a nice positive balance.

Maybe check out r/options for some DD (you hate)."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Set up a demo account maybe? That will improve your understanding of stocks? But it kind of sounds like you have given up on it then maybe stop trading and looking at stocks for a period of time and start over when you are ready and want to, its not just easy money you really have to read and learn a lot"
03/23/2021,stocks,"Learning options isn’t necessarily bad. I use them occasionally to leverage a play I believe in. However, I would focus on getting better at DD. That’s what will make you money."
03/23/2021,stocks,That's why the best strategy is buying and holding. Don't take profits for at least a decade.
03/23/2021,stocks,"Sounds a lot like voodoo magic and work to me. You’re better off doing the bare minimum research into a company you’re interested and then buying and holding for a few years. Seriously, it’s much easier than options but they require more patience. I tried options for about a year and I was successful for a while before losing a good amount of money. Once you have a good base in stocks you can then foray into options as a means of enhancing return or acquiring leverage or even **as a source of income**. There’s lots of options strategies besides buying calls. You just rushed into options and made a bunch of bad decisions that ended up in you losing money and now you’re bummed out about it. OPTIONS ARE DIFFICULT. You can do the most amount of research and still lose money because you’re going against a force you don’t understand. With stocks you can do the bare minimum amount of research and still come out on top."
03/23/2021,stocks,Step away from the market and read up on this stuff. It’s very interesting.
03/23/2021,stocks,"You dumped the money, now wait."
03/23/2021,stocks,"When people say wait, they usually mean more than a few months."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Then you’re like 100 percent of people that tried something they didn’t know everything about. Preparation is the first step. But you can’t get so caught up in the minutia that you’re unable to move forward. Failure is when you chose to not move forward. Sure you may fail a class or make a bad investment but that’s learning. Failing is when you become unwilling to learn. Failing is when you’re not learning and continue to make the same unsuccessful choice because you’re afraid to try something else. There’s a quote I read that changed my perspective and probably my whole life. Discipline can take you to places that motivation can’t. 
That means being disciplined and committing a goal will let you accomplish the goals you start when you’re motivated but abandon when they become difficult."
03/23/2021,stocks,I’m asking you to really consider not trading options. The fact that you referred to it as playing should be an indication to you that you shouldn’t engage in it. You can lose money you don’t have. Put 5 bucks a week into an etf and if you want to be a day trader learn day trading like the back of your hand before you put one dollar down. Choose a path and commit to it. That is where you will find the stability and growth that you have been looking for.
03/23/2021,stocks,"I'm not a huge fan of striking because of TBI risk but to each their own. I'm a big guy and I get my ass kicked regularly by small females. Talk about ego death.

03/23/2021,stocks,Right.... well my goal with investing/options/whatever else is next is to pay off my student debt. I can do that in 10 years without the market.
03/23/2021,stocks,I understand. Lol. That makes me feel like I’m accepting defeat.
03/23/2021,stocks,Okay
03/23/2021,stocks,"Ah. Yea. Sounds like I’m talking to a therapist now. 

This is all overwhelming me right now. Now I have to develop a whole new mental outlook on life? Ugh. Don’t get me wrong, I get what you’re saying but I really feel like I’d be better off having not tried the market at all. I don’t want to give up but every fiber of my being is screaming that if I keep going, I’m only going to lose money. 

I need some time to dwell on all of this."
03/23/2021,stocks,Okay. Thanks
03/23/2021,stocks,I wish it was that easy. I am that guy who checks his phone 50+ times a day. Maybe that’ll chNge with strategies
03/23/2021,stocks,Yeah exactly but instead of just thinking „yeah making money but dont know why“ try to learn why you were making money because paper trading is really like real trading but with fake money you know? Try looking for catalysts (catalysts are basically things or events or news that affect the stock price) like if apples headquarters were burned down right now it would heavily affect their stock price
03/23/2021,stocks,"I’d recommend learning about the bond market and it’s affect on the stock market since it’s relevant right now. Learning how to read financial statements is also good (10-k and 10-Q). Here is a video that may help here: https://youtu.be/8YY5OzLzLuo

I’d also try to find some of the better DD posts on Reddit to see what to look for."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Check out you tubers that specialize in dividend investing to start with. This is probably the most simple form of investing where you pick a solid company and hold and watch them pay you over time. The best part about this strategy? There’s lists of amazing companies already made for you to go shopping from in the form of the dividend achievers list, dividend aristocrats list, and the dividend kings list. I would personally suggest looking there when finding some core reliable stocks that you can hold and sleep soundly at night with knowing they’ve been around in some cases for 100+ years and have been paying dividends for 50+ years. 

As far as youtubers, personally I watch Andrei Jikh, mark tilbury, Bruce wang, Humphrey yang, dividend bull, and genZ investor."
03/23/2021,stocks,I get it man. Just take your money out and do some research. There’s nothing wrong with taking a break. I just want to see you do well and be happy bro! Hopefully we will see each other on the moon one day. Feel free to message me if you want to talk about it.🤙
03/23/2021,stocks,"Invest in less volatile stocks. I like to do short term too so I do have an etrade that I'm constantly refreshing and buying and selling that I'm 50% up on for the year, thats my ""fun money"" that was gone the second I invested, if I make money? Great it'll pay for a vacation or get swept into my retirement. If i lose money? Oh well. That is not the 20% that I was talking about. Thats 5 grand of fun money. Only do that type of shit if you can afford it. But If you make it easy on yourself, this is how I would do it in your situation. Spend a week researching have 10-12 different stocks you wanna invest in and 3-4 different funds at different levels of risk. Invest 80% into the funds immediately and just keep putting a set amount into each one every paycheck. Now I personally don't like investing into the big ones as my individuals. Theres so much of my funds dedicated to aapl and amzn and fb and googl etc already that why double down and invest my 20%. I still like to invest in mostly established companies with my retirement. One of my plays right now is Ford...its probably not on a single one of my funds. And some marijuana plays and other stuff that probably isn't going to be represented in my funds. But until you learn patience I would only invest in companies that would be boring as shit to look at 50+ times a day."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Well, I’m scalping options mostly. That’s what I had success with, with paper trading. As soon as I switched over, that’s when I started losing.

Investing in stocks long term.... is lost on me. I’m not good at DD. Numbers and maths don’t make much sense. I don’t have confidence in myself to do much speculation. That’s why I like options. It’s a little more technical, and to me, that’s easier."
03/23/2021,stocks,Okay. Thanks
03/23/2021,stocks,Thanks man
03/23/2021,stocks,"And I mean researching. I don't mean reading ""DD"" on reddit and buying after the stocks already seen a 100-1000% increase YTD. If you don't know where to start just jump into the top few hundred companies in the SP500 and find out which ones of them you think are going to have the most growth by end of year. Only invest if you are VERY confident in them. and get the fuck out of options. You're buying shares. You can dip back into options once you've learned more about how to make money off of them. But I would never touch them with any serious amount of money."

03/23/2021,stocks,"Options is quite a mouthful especially if your new to trading and with that said i think i‘ve found your problem, start with normal trading buy and sell stocks options is really just gambling actually and is really hard to master even for pros"
03/23/2021,stocks,">Instead of giving up, maybe just don’t listen to whomever you’ve been listening to. Speak with an actual financial advisor.

I think with the attitude of numbers and maths dont make much sense, i certainly would be buying any options. Use logic, if you cant and are unable to value a long position, how can you possibly find value in an options trade? you need to know the stock's value to determine if an option is profitable."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Yea but it’s easy to start with. I don’t have 10K liquid to dump into a bunch of random shares. At least with options, $500 can get me pretty far.

Well, not me because I’m a fucking idiot, but other people."
03/23/2021,stocks,"I disagree. 

My strategy consists of being in a stock for only a few minutes, some times seconds. I ride waves that happen intraday, not over weeks/months/years. Surely you have seen stuff like this before?

Stock xyz has resistance at 50. 

It clears 50 and travels up to $52, rejects, and travels back down to $49.

I enter at $50, ride the wave up to $52 and (ideally) exit at the top. 

With this strategy it really doesn’t matter what the company even is. You just need to perfect that strategy."
03/23/2021,stocks,"I dont have 10k liquid but even with 500$ you could get pretty far with just trading stocks fast cash is not always the way, start slow and build up a little fortune over the time and maybe take 10-20% of that and use it on options"
03/23/2021,stocks,Well how do I even start?
03/23/2021,stocks,Take your 500$ buy som strong long term and steady profitting stocks and next month you put a little more money into at with 100$ a month u have 1200$ a year in just savings
03/23/2021,stocks,"Yea maybe thats what I should do.

I don’t know man. I’m really not having a good day today. I just gotta re-evaluate all of this. 

It really sucks because a lot of my friends have gotten into this now too, so every other conversation is about stocks and how much money they have made. Idk man. I just feel really discouraged by all of this."
03/23/2021,stocks,I feel that exact pain sometimes but dont listen to em be honest with yourself and start when and if your ready dont push yourself into something thats not working for you u know?
03/23/2021,stocks,"Don’t get down on yourself - the past 2 weeks have been unkind to most.

I too am curious how you haven’t made gains in the past year.  I have about 30% into leaps and 70% into safer stocks that I believe in. Current market conditions feels like a correction - I’ve sold all my riskier positions and just parked the money into assets I feel strongly about- going to let it ride until the market feels more bullish."
03/23/2021,stocks,Because I’m an idiot who plays options
03/23/2021,stocks,"I started rolling the dice on options after I had taken my measly initial investment and doubled it. I look at options now as lotto tickets - I’ll throw $10 or $20 at a couple of calls or puts and see what happens, but in general it’s.... barely safer than the roulette table. 

I bought for example some $100p 3/26 puts on G M E Friday - last time I did this I won big. But this time it shat the bed so I took the haircut yesterday and moved on.  The theta on short term options will kill value so if unless you feel REALLY strongly about it sell your position ASAP and move on- longer you hold a losing bet the worse it will be

Again, I’m no financial guru, but I’d invest safely (stocks, etf, safe blue chip type stuff)- take the profits from that and gamble with that extra money 

That’s what I do"
03/23/2021,stocks,"Okay, thanks"
2021-03-23 17:57:46,stocks,"Playing “catch up” sucks! I got into some retail of investing and had no idea I was about to break one of the most known rules of investing. I bought everything at its peak. Pinterest at 89, ARKK at 154, etc. Most of what I have bought into has  dropped by 20+ percent. I keep reminding myself I am going to be long on these, but am now getting worried that they are going to continue to drop and drop and drop. Above?"
03/23/2021,stocks,I look at investing like planting seeds.  Some plants  will grow some won’t.
03/23/2021,stocks,The market is about one thing: rewarding the patient.  Go away for a few years and then check your portfolio.
03/23/2021,stocks,"If I had to get rid of all my stocks but keep one for the next five years, it would be PINS.  

You didn't buy at ""the"" top, you bought at ""a"" top.  Right now we're in a period of rotation between sectors and adjustment to macro events (rising yields).  So all the high flying tech stocks have pulled back.  The good ones will form bases, which could take weeks-months, but they will eventually resume their growth.  The bad ones might never recover."
03/23/2021,stocks,I’m down bout 10% with all my ark ETFs too:(
03/23/2021,stocks,"Same here, got into investing at the start of the year and have been slowly buying the last few months and nearly everything I touch immediately falls 5-20% and then sits there. It's almost comical at this point. I'm amazing at nailing a stocks all time high."
03/23/2021,stocks,"I'm with you on arkk. I bought at 155. averaged it down to 140. And I'm really at the point I don't want to keep dumping money into it. I was expecting a little better recovery since the correction, but it's having a hard time. I'm really just hoping that It hits the high again before a crash and I can sell off the higher shares and reposition myself at lower price I averaged down with and then I'll feel comfortable holding for a long time."
03/23/2021,stocks,when you finally break even... then market corrects again and you get to bag hold for another 3 months.. usually that's what happens when you buy at the top
03/23/2021,stocks,"i feel ya, i got into half my stuff that im holding too high, have been averaging down for a month. todays dip will help with that."
03/23/2021,stocks,"My first order was for 20 shares of PLUG in 2018 for $1.74/ea. I watched the next day in horror as they dropped to $1.64 and sold them all, felt terrible. 

Today those would be worth $750. That was a very smart investment I made, and a very stupid emotional reaction that resulted in a small loss, when I could have been very patient and had a big win. 

Hang tight. The worst thing you can do is anything, the second worse thing you can do is not take profit."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Feeling the same way.  Started investing just before gme and the market correction.  Bought many things at their ""top."". Learned a lot since then but market has been tough lately.  I bought 3 ARKs and down about 20% in each.  It hurts but I hope patience will help"
03/23/2021,stocks,"There are a lot of good lessons here. Don't follow the trends unless you truly believe in the underlying. Everyone buying GME but what is there that the company is doing that fundamentally generated the value it currently sits at? Not much.

ARKK on the other hand is made up of ""disruptors"". Does the strategy of investing in a bundle of potential future disruptors make sense? Maybe. If it does to you, keep putting some money in as it falls. This helps you cost average down and feels way better as it comes back. 

Some of these companies might never see these highs again, but more realistically this was ""a"" top and will look miniscule compared to another ""top"" in the future (5-10 years later)."
03/23/2021,stocks,Average down
03/23/2021,stocks,"Thats not a rule of investing because you literally couldnt have predicted those were the top. I bought ARKK at the peak too, but it had been going steadily up for months. We just happened to buy at a bad time unfortunately."
03/23/2021,stocks,">getting worried that they are going to continue to drop and drop and drop

They could. But its ok if some of your stocks go down, you aren't a fortune teller, other stocks you hold should go up. But if all your stocks are down 20%, just being honest that is a massive loss (many years worth of historically average returns), and you need to either become better at picking stocks or stick to index funds which are safe to hold through dips long term."
03/23/2021,stocks,"I am thankful for the life lesson here. It has taught me patience and to not overreact and sell. Lessons I will need in my older years I’m sure. But, damn, just feels sometimes like just can’t catch a break and it won’t bounce back. I know it will as it always does, but c’mon. Give me a little something to work with. Ha"
03/23/2021,stocks,"Its been a shitty past few weeks. Take the time to do some learning and reflecting while your portfolio is taking a shit. ive got a few positions i should have cut loose as well, but didnt, and havent decided to cut loose just yet"
03/23/2021,stocks,"Yeah my friend you didn’t do anything that wrong tbh - you were just unlucky with the timing, unfortunately the market has declined a lot since Feb/March.

As others have said though, it’s about “time in the market” not “timing the market” (think Buffett said that) - so if you believe in the stocks long term, then just hold and wait for the long term recovery. If you think it’s a crappy company eg Lordstown Motors and not Apple (Apple will be likely be a great long term pick) then I would dump it if you think there’s a chance it could go to zero.

Good luck sir, and welcome to the volatile (but occasionally lucrative) world of retail investing"
03/23/2021,stocks,If they are companies you believe in and are invested long term you shouldn’t be worrying after weeks or months.
03/23/2021,stocks,"dollar cost average, keep buying small amounts at lower prices"
03/23/2021,stocks,"“Buy high, sell low”, ... so that others may “buy low, sell high”. Thank you for your contribution."
03/23/2021,stocks,Every think in arkk was so incredibly over valued. Still really over valued in my opinion.
03/23/2021,stocks,[deleted]
03/23/2021,stocks,"Hope you didn't buy GME at 400, or maybe yes, but at least hope you didn't sell at a loss 😅"

03/23/2021,stocks,Unless you invested in pets.com
03/23/2021,stocks,Very true.
03/23/2021,stocks,can i ask what the draw is with pins? i don't know anyone who uses it anymore but i also don't know the company's future plans
03/23/2021,stocks,"""You didn't buy at ""the"" top, you bought at ""a"" top.""  - That was really well said.  I never thought of it that way."
03/23/2021,stocks,Thanks. Needed a peptalk for sure. I know the right move is to buy more and maybe average down but I’m just struggling to pull the trigger.
03/23/2021,stocks,"> PINS

Hey I'm in this."
03/23/2021,stocks,I prefer arkw.. it has done me well
03/23/2021,stocks,Just hope that TSLA continues its growth...
03/23/2021,stocks,This. If you believe in the companies then you should be buying still.
03/23/2021,stocks,It is kind of rule though that the price you buy a security will impact the ROI
03/23/2021,stocks,"I hope you own one of these

Msft aapl dis."
03/23/2021,stocks,Same lol that’s kind of what I had in mind
03/23/2021,stocks,"Why did you buy? Due to hype on reddit or did you actually check their financial and see a undervalued company?




If it's reddit hype you've learnt a lesson, there's no such thing as a free lunch and people pumping stocks do so for a reason. Sorry but no one wants to make you rich. If you did your DD and actually read their financial you must know what they'll achieve, *why you invested* and how they'll crush the competition soon enough? Good stocks go up over time, bad fall. Which one did you buy?"
03/23/2021,stocks,"It’s a “pre-shopping source”. People use it to find inspiration for recipes, home reno, and personal style, which translates to making a purchase towards those things thanks to targeted advertising. They’ve partnered with Shopify to bring in product catalogs so it’s good for e-commerce. Solid buy 👍"
03/23/2021,stocks,"I'm not OP and I also am not invested in them. 

They are still growing user counts YoY. Most of their users are still domestic but internationally that have grown significantly. User data and ads are valuable these days."
03/23/2021,stocks,"I think it’s the fact it’s tied to everything. If I look up a lesson for teaching, it’s connected to Pinterest. Recipe? Pinterest. The overexposure and basic recognition of he product is going to open them up for to a huge market."
03/23/2021,stocks,"I'd love to get in, but I'm fully invested right now since the correction. Waiting for it to go back up to get money out."
03/23/2021,stocks,This guy gets it 👆
03/23/2021,stocks,"Well of course itll impact the ROI. The issue is that you don't know when itll stop going up or til when. If you can buy something for cheaper, yes, do that. You have no control over that though. If you bought it at the top, and it kept going up, then it wouldve been a good time to buy (besides earlier)."
03/23/2021,stocks,But where do they get their money from? I’m highly skeptical of the long term growth of online tech reliant on delivering ads to their user base for profits.
03/23/2021,stocks,"yeah that's a good point i didn't consider, it's my first go-to in those situations. thanks for the insight!"
03/23/2021,stocks,"> targeted advertising

IOS 14? Cookie apocalypse in 2022? The advertising industry is going to fundamentally change over the next couple years. Pinterest is not foolproof. Tread lightly."
03/23/2021,stocks,"awesome, thanks!"
03/23/2021,stocks,Out of interest what did you buy PINS at?
03/23/2021,stocks,"I'm no expert on the tech at all but I think advertising on Pinterest is different from social media sites because it is targeted based on what you do within the site itself, not based on what you search outside the site.  So the advertising on Pinterest is personalized and fits seamlessly into the browsing experience.

Besides, advertising is only the first step in the revenue generation vision for the company.  Eventually Pinterest will be a one-stop shop that begins with visual search.  You'll be able to buy directly through the site itself, sign up for courses and classes on things you're searching, and so on.

The brilliance of Pinterest is that it's not social media, it's visual search.  People don't go to Facebook or Instagram to shop, they go there to communicate with people, complain about stuff, and look at memes.  That's why advertising on those sites is annoying and interferes with the user experience.  But people go to Pinterest to look for stuff: recipes, hairstyles, home decor ideas, tattoos, artwork, etc, so the advertising fits very naturally into the user experience."
03/23/2021,stocks,It’s good value for the same reason Honey sold for $2million a couple years ago; they are selling your shopping habits. Information is the new currency.
03/23/2021,stocks,Explain how personalized advertising works at scale without MAIDs and cookies.
03/23/2021,stocks,"  you logging into their closed platform and giving them heaps of data while browsing there? Why are you acting like online targeted advertising is going anywhere at all, it will only evolve like it has for decades"
2021-03-23 17:55:28,stocks,"Saia adds 20th facility in the Northeast Less-than-truckload carrier Saia Inc. (NASDAQ: SAIA) announced Monday the addition of another terminal in the northeastern U.S. The Johns Creek, Georgia-based carrier’s newly opened facility near Wilmington, Delaware, marks its 20th addition to the region in the last four years.

In 2017, Saia embarked on an aggressive Northeast growth campaign, adding terminals from New Hampshire to Maryland. Those plans accelerated following the demise of New England Motor Freight, which had a large terminal footprint in the area.

“The new facility in Wilmington enhances our service across this geography as well as throughout our network,” said Jared Mull, VP of operations for the East. “Beyond this new terminal, we plan to open an additional four to six facilities throughout the course of this year, including our Northeast Atlanta terminal targeted for the fourth quarter.”

On the company’s fourth-quarter call, management announced a $275 million net capital expenditures budget for 2021, which includes investments in its fleet, infrastructure and terminals. Saia spent $219 million in capex in 2020, a year that many companies cut investments and preserved liquidity due to uncertainty around COVID-19.

The carrier added one terminal and replaced five others in 2020, increasing total door count by 4%. Saia plans to eclipse that mark this year.

The step up in spending includes the purchase of raw land, greenfield developments and terminal expansions. Saia is aiming to expand capacity, improve its freight mix and reduce turn times by adding facilities that are closer to its customers.

“Despite the challenges that 2020 presented, we are continuing to execute our plans to grow and provide quality, industry-leading service for our customers,” added Mull.


Old Dominion Freight Line (NASDAQ: ODFL) recently announced a hiring blitz for drivers and dockworkers following plans to expand its terminal network again this year. Yellow Corp. (NASDAQ: YELL) said it was adding 1,500 drivers and opening 12 driver academies in February. Last year, Forward Air (NASDAQ: FWRD) expanded its LTL offering to include a more traditional service outside of its legacy airport-to-airport terminals.

While LTL tonnage took a weather-related hit in February, analysts have become more bullish on the space in recent weeks as volumes have snapped back. Additionally, more of the industrial economy appears to be coming back online, historically a large contributor of LTL freight, and contractual price negotiations are yielding mid- to high-single-digit increases.

2021-03-23 17:20:54,stocks,"Does my current portfolio look like a safe set up for long-term growth? Hey everyone! So a little background: I'm 29 years old and I just started investing some of my savings a few weeks ago. I opened an account with M1 Finance and created a pie. I will list below my holdings and I would love to hear some input from the community. My goal is of course to grow this as rapidly and steadily as possible. I wanted to see if you guys think it's better for me to ditch some of the companies so that I can increase my shares at others. This is nearly 50% of my savings just FYI. I have a bit in crypto and the rest in a bank account. I greatly appreciate any and all advice. Thanks so much!

I have deposited about **$20,000**.

**45%:** VTI

**45% consists of 2% shares of 50 companies:** MMM, ABBV, AMD, APD, BABA, GOOGL, MO, AMZN, AXP, AAPL, T, BAC, BRK.B, BA, BMY, KO, DLR, DIS, ENB, XOM, FB, GM, GH, HON, INTC, IBM, JNJ, KHC, LMT, MA, MCD, MRK, MU, MSFT, NFLX, NSC, PEP, PM, PG, QCOM, RTX, SPYG, STAG, TSLA, USB, VLO, VZ, V, WPC, & WM

**5%:** VEA,

**5%:** VWO

As an added note, if I dropped some of the 50 companies and had more shares of the remainder, my dividends would go up correct? I like the idea of that, but I of course want to stick with a good balance between safety and growth. Keep in mind I've dived into the stock world less that a month ago, so my understanding of it is weak. A little more than half of the companies are just ones I know and trust and enjoy their products, while the rest are recommendations or found via research.

In addition to this portfolio I have a Roth IRA:

**70%:** VTI

**20%:** VXUS

**10%:** BND"
03/23/2021,stocks,"Hi! I think it is a bit redundant tho hold VTI and all those large cap stocks. They are (due to the fact, that they make up a lot of VTI) highly correlated, so there are no diversification effects from doing this. I would put a certain amount into VTI and then just think about how much I am willing to put in 3-5 single stocks next to that."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Looks like way too many companies for a small 20k portfolio. Though I like most of them, there is no way you can reasonably keep up with every single one of these. I would suggest cutting 50% and putting that money into your highest convictions of the remaining 50%."
03/23/2021,stocks,One way of doing this is just to put most money in VTI and then buy stocks you think have a “huge upside potential” with “play money” which a large number of people take to be < 10% of portfolio value.
03/23/2021,stocks,Love me some low fee vanguards.
03/23/2021,stocks,Looks good in general. I’d trim some of those individual holdings and put the money in to a more focused lot.
03/23/2021,stocks,Thank you everyone for the suggestions! It sounds like I should cut down from those 50 companies and focus on just a few of them while maintaining a majority of my funds in VTI.
03/23/2021,stocks,BND isn’t doing you any favors. Dump it and purchase more VTI. Why hold something that will stifle long term growth?
03/23/2021,stocks,"That's exactly what I was thinking. However, with my current set up don't I earn more dividends this way?"
03/23/2021,stocks,That makes sense to me. I'm assuming none of the 50 that I have chosen would fall into the category of some thing that has huge upside potential? We're talking about smaller companies that I believe may explode in the future.
03/23/2021,stocks,Aka Gamestop
03/23/2021,stocks,BND is in my Roth IRA because I read somewhere that it was important to have as part of the package? I'll ditch it if that's the consensus.
03/23/2021,stocks,"If VTI does not pay dividends, you are right. But why then buy VTI at all? You could invest everything in those 50 Stocks. That's nearly as diversified as an ETF and would earn you even more dividends?"
03/23/2021,stocks,Not necessarily smaller or younger companies but companies whose shares are currently undervalued compared to current financials or future potential.
03/23/2021,stocks,Like I said I have only been at this for a few weeks so my understanding of it is not very strong yet.
03/23/2021,stocks,Understood. Thank you.
2021-03-23 16:47:42,stocks,"How can institutional ownership of a stock reach 200%, while the official SI is lower than 100%? Original source:

https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mb5bfr/holy_uranus_look_at_this_institutional_ownership/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

Finra Morningstar data showed 200% equity ownership of institutions, whereas the official SI hangs around 30. 

I have studies maths, but it really doesn't take more than basic 4th grade arithmetic to figure out that that is impossible:

To own 200 shares of 100 possible, there need to be 100 short sold ones. Whether those are naked ones, or rehypothecated ones, does not matter. The SI needs to be at least the institutional ownership over 100. No way around that.


And this does not even factor in retail or insider holdings.

Can someone explain this to me?"
03/23/2021,stocks,I think Melvin can
03/23/2021,stocks,"If you look at the far right column there is a date which is probably the last date that institution reported their holdings.  Most are as of December and others go all the way back to last September.  My guess is these are just very stale numbers from when the short interest was much higher.  Additionally some of the older ones could have just sold their shares to the two most up to date ones.  The problem with all of these numbers (including short interest) is that they are not real time and are based on company disclosures.

Edit:  Yahoo has institutional ownership at 122% not 200%

Edit2:  There is another comment in the thread that mentions that the older Fidelity line item was actually sold to the more recent one  but it is still listed twice."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Because not all institutions report changes in holdings at the same time. For instance, institutions which scooped up ETF shares might have reported already, while the ETFs themselves still report their pre-balancing holdings."
03/23/2021,stocks,Reporting dates
03/23/2021,stocks,"Common Core Math.

In otherwords...it can't they are lying to you and will use nonsensical bs to prove they are right.

The 200% institutional ownership is a result of these institutions buying up the shorts as they are released, and the day is coming when the shorters will have the devil to pay. They are hoping that you don't notice the discrepancy and join in on taking them to task."
03/23/2021,stocks,probably due to slow updates in the publicly-available data. figures released in the various institutions normally correspond to an institution's holding date. i'd expect the dates to differ across all institutions that hold the stock hence resulting in some institutions holding more than 100% of the shares available.
03/23/2021,stocks,"Good point. Thank you very much for this! So what you're saying is, with the data out of date, the only way to get this resolved is to hold and wait, potentially even buy more, until every institution has to file their updates if there are any (month after this quarter isn't it?)"
03/23/2021,stocks,Thank you for that! That makes sense. Only possible course of action therefore is to hold and buy more? Thank you for the advice!
03/23/2021,stocks,Good point. So you're saying we have to hold on longer?
03/23/2021,stocks,That list just seems really weird because Fidelity is listed twice with two different dates and so is Black Rock.  I would try to find a different source.  As I said Yahoo lists it at 122% but with no as of date.  I also don't think there is any specific dates companies have to update their holdings by outside of when they actually cross the threshold of controlling interest.  Short interest has specific dates but I don't think institutional ownership does.
03/23/2021,stocks,"YOLO some weeklies on TSLA if you want to go to the casino, its way more entertaining"
03/23/2021,stocks,"Well they always have to file their 13fs every 45 days after a quarter in which the change was made, unless it's a more than 5% move in which case it's the end of that month deadline.


So basically, 45 days after end of each quarter it should be up to date as of the end of the quarter."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Mh, not a fan of F._.Ds tbh. I buy and hold stocks, like Warren Buffet!"
03/23/2021,stocks,tbh options are way safer than buy and hold gme mate
03/23/2021,stocks,"It literally can't go tits up mate!


(I've been around. Fully agree, if done right, options can be a very low risk play. Think iron condors and PMCCs. but not weekly otms... That's burning money)"

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Tuesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/23/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-tuesday-march-23.html)

*****

> # 1. S&P 500 set to drop on anniversary of stock bull market

> * U.S. stock futures dropped Tuesday after the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 broke two-session losing streaks. The Nasdaq logged a second straight session of gains, recovering about half of Thursday’s 3% decline. Tech stocks benefited over the past two sessions from the 10-year Treasury yield retreating from last week’s 14-month high. Tuesday marks one year since the Covid low in the stock market, which ended the fastest bear market ever and ushered in another bull market. The S&P 500 has gained 76% since the March 23, 2020 close of 2,237. Over the past year, two presidents, Congress and the Federal Reserve put extraordinary fiscal and monetary policies in place to support the economy during the pandemic.

*****

> # 2. Yellen, Powell to testify on Capitol Hill on economic recovery

> * Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen testify Tuesday before the House Financial Services Committee on the economy at 12 p.m. ET. Yellen, who was Powell’s predecessor, said she sees both growth and possibly full employment next year. She credits President Joe Biden’s Covid relief package. For his part, Powell’s prepared remarks struck a cautiously optimism tone, saying the economy is “much improved” but the recovery is “far from complete.” Last week, after its March meeting, the Fed forecasted higher growth and inflation, while saying interest rates will likely remain near zero through 2023.

*****

> # 3. U.S. officials: AstraZeneca may have included outdated data

> * An independent group of U.S. health advisors said Tuesday that AstraZeneca may have included outdated information in its Covid vaccine trial results. The questions came one day after the U.K. drug maker said a late-stage trial in U.S. and in Latin America showed 79% efficacy for its two-shot regimen. The Data Safety Monitoring Board expressed concern about whether the material provided by AstraZeneca created an “incomplete view of the efficacy data.” AstraZeneca, which said Monday it planned to file for FDA emergency use authorization next month, did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment.

*****

> # 4. Covid cases rise in parts of U.S. as some states relax restrictions

> * New Covid cases are once again on the rise across more than half of the U.S., as health officials warn about reopening too soon and race to vaccinate more people before highly contagious strains become prevalent in the country. As of Sunday, the seven-day average of new cases rose by 5% or more in 27 states, according to a CNBC analysis of data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. Across the U.S., the nation logged an average of 54,308 new cases per day over the past week, a 1% rise from the prior week after months of rapidly declining case numbers.

*****

> # 5. Biden considers $3 trillion package for infrastructure

> * Biden is assembling the next big White House priority, a $3 trillion infrastructure package. That would be on top of his recently signed $1.9 trillion coronavirus stimulus. The president met privately late Monday with Senate Democrats as Congress has already begun laying the groundwork with legislation for developing roads, hospitals and green energy systems as part of Biden’s “Build Back Better” campaign promise. While the goal is a bipartisan package, Democrats in Congress have signaled a willingness to go it alone if they’re blocked by Republicans.

Msft"
03/23/2021,stocks,"> somehow tech/growth is down. 

Tell that to MS, AAPL, AMZN and GOOG"
03/23/2021,stocks,"When are they going public?  I keep seeing ""this week"""
03/23/2021,stocks,Great Meme Everything?
03/23/2021,stocks,No clue so I put in a limit buy at $27 for 30 days so I can get in when it goes live.
2021-03-23 16:04:34,stocks,"How often historically do companies recall shorted shares? So with all the stocks floating about the internet that have short interest that are high, obviously people are in to make a quick buck when short interest raises the price based on shorts being covered by buying. This got me thinking, I mean in reality, how likely/often do companies even recall shorted stocks? Is it even in their interest to do so, same for brokers, when they are making interest on the shorted stocks? In what scenario would a company/broker want to recall shorted stocks?"
03/23/2021,stocks,"If the stock up jumps in price a ton, they might recall a portion of their shorted shares to sell for a profit.

But usually it's the opposite I think.  If a stock's price drops a ton, companies might recall their shares to sell and mitigate their losses.  But that's exactly what shorter's want; to sell the stock high and then buy it back once it's low."
03/23/2021,stocks,"I think if a company wants to shake shorts the do what rocket did and put a special dividend which shorts have to pay, or a buy back of shares driving the total number of shares on the market down driving price up. Also huge institutions can borrow and short externally from the market to where externally don't see short they just see the price move down."
03/23/2021,stocks,"What do you mean by companies recalling shorted stocks?  If you mean the company that is being shorted the answer is never because they have no ability to do that.  All they can do is buy back their shares.

If you mean the brokers that lent the shares to the short seller  they would only recall the shares when the real owner sold them so that they could be delivered to the new buyer but they would try to borrow the shares from someone else first."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Let's clarify a few things. The issuer of the shares (ex. Walmart) cannot force a recall of shares they do not own. Only the owner of the shares can recall them, and they can only recall shares after they've been lent out to someone else.

It's true that the share lender often earns interest on their lent shares (if not, then why would they lend then out on the first place) but that doesn't mean they have no incentive to recall the shares.

In certain circumstances such as a stock split, dividend issuance, or shareholder vote the lender may wish to recall shares in order to prove ownership of the underlying security. Without proof of equity ownership, the original owner may not be entitled to the aforementioned benefits."
03/23/2021,stocks,"But this does not affect anything if it happens to the apes who bought stocks at the market price, right?"
03/23/2021,stocks,"So wouldn't that create a never ending loop in which the shorted shares are never covered? 

&#x200B;

Is it possible for a company to just demand all of the shorted shares be returned?"
03/23/2021,stocks,Good stuff. Thanks. Purpose of this is determining whether short interest actually guarantees the upward motion of stock price or not. Looks like the answer is the same as always. It depends.
03/23/2021,stocks,"No because the shorter's just buy the now-cheaper shares off the market to give to the company they borrowed the share from. 


>Is it possible for a company to just demand all of the shorted shares be returned?

When you say ""company"" do you mean the company thay *owns* the shorted shares or the company that the shares are from (as in the ticker)?

If Microsoft owns 1000 shares of Apple, they Microsoft can allow those shares to be shorted (and Microsoft gets interest on the shares).  Microsoft can recall them at any time.  But Apple has no say in it.  They can't demand shorted shares of their company be returned to their original owners as far as I'm aware.

Microsoft *could* demand all 1000 shares be returned to them at once but I don't know how common that is.  I don't think that info gets directly released."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Yeah by company I meant the ticker. That clears things up. So the ticker company has no power over the shorted shared. So reasonably, it would basically never happen that all the shorted shares are recalled. And as long as they're making interest, the owner of the share won't recall them. Furthermore, as the share price goes up from being bought to cover the short, the stock will get shorted again (In some cases)."
2021-03-23 14:45:02,stocks,"How long does it normally take to become a consistently profitable trader? I've been trading for almost a year now. Been through a lot of ups and downs - the hype phase (beginners luck, making money in the market is easy), the downturn (got greedy and eventually give back all profits to the market), the depressing phase (on a losing streak, studied a lot but can't seem to get back on track, capital shrinking day by day, constantly feel like giving up), and now slowly entering the realisation phase (more discipline with proper risk management, better control of emotions, better understanding of market cycles, technical analysis, better position sizing etc.)

The problem is, despite losing less now, I am still unable to be consistently profitable. I am getting exhausted for not seeing results even after spending at least 3 hours to study the market everyday without fail. I don't want to give up, but it just seems like trading is not meant for me. Is it normal to feel this way? It seems like I am adding emotional stress to myself everyday with my own hard earned money. I couldn't focus at work, I am losing interest in my other passions (which could be funded initially with my capital if I hadn't lose it).

I am currently down 40%, and I don't know when I will be able to come back. Or if it's worth it or not. Sometimes I just feel like throwing what I have left into some meme stocks and gamble it away. Sometimes I feel like I should keep trying, only to be met with losses. 

Is trading really not for me? Should I give up?"
03/23/2021,stocks,Most people lose money trying to day trade. Is there a reason you're studying so much and not just using index funds to help mitigate your losses
03/23/2021,stocks,"Sounds like you’re still on tilt, as they say in poker.

You’re under no obligation to enter into anything less than a great scenario - I’d focus on getting a portfolio of stocks to follow that you get to know, and then looking for perfect entry points - sometimes the pressure to be “doing something” is the biggest problem."
03/23/2021,stocks,"For the vast majority day trading is a losing game. 

I have two accounts, one where I day trade, and one where I pick stocks I like and mostly hold. 

My normal account is up 150% in the last year, my day trading stock, about 5% and that's mostly the big green machine of the last year bailing me out of bad decisions.  

It is possible to keep trading with out day trading.  It's an addiction and it's hard to break from wanting to make moves daily.  

I keep my two accounts separate for that very reason.  I want to be a day trader, but I'm just not good enough. I play with money I am ok with losing, and do it more for fun/feed my addiction so that I can leave my other account alone and let it grow. 

Good luck."
03/23/2021,stocks,"I’m not really a trader but it seems like Index funds, DCA and not looking at your portfolio can help reduce the stress"
03/23/2021,stocks,"> 3 hours to study the market everyday  

Genuinely curious, what are you studding? 

The answer to your question, how long does it normally take, is same as, how long does it take to become a professional foot ball player...it depends."
03/23/2021,stocks,Read my magnum opus in profile
03/23/2021,stocks,Open VOO and go back to when you first started trading and compare the price to what it is now. You’ll probably stop day trading after you realize the profit you could have had.
03/23/2021,stocks,"However long it takes you to adopt good practices e.g. getting in at your desired price, having targets and an exit strategy *before* you buy. Setting trailing stops or limits to hedge against losses. 

I’m not perfect, but in my experience when it comes to being a consistently good trader it’s not about how long you’ve been doing it so much as how disciplined you are."
03/23/2021,stocks,Throw it into a solid etf like voo or vti or qqq amd dont look at it for a few months. Take a break from the market and come back realigned and refreshed.
03/23/2021,stocks,How can you be down from last year during one of the greatest bull runs ever?  Did you constantly trade back and forth and tried to chase the stocks that pop?
03/23/2021,stocks,"Have you looked into Phil Towns strategy?  Listen to the InvestED podcast.   Plenty of good books at the library.   Avoid speculation, invest in healthy companies that you believe in."
03/23/2021,stocks,lfmao...just make grow those balls of steel
03/23/2021,stocks,"It is hard to be consistently profitable trading.  If you started trading 10 years ago, the market in general was going up.  It was one of the longest bull runs in market history.  It was ""easier"" to be profitable.  Over the past year, the market has been a roller coaster, making it ""harder"" to be consistently profitable.  I choose long term investing instead.  The market is rarely negative over any 10 plus year holding period."
03/23/2021,stocks,"In my short time I’ve learned it’s better to buy and hold for the most part.   When I started I’d either miss the train and sell after the stock dumped or sell for a small profit only to see it rise more within a month or two.  Find stocks you believe in, that you think have a good chance of improving over time and let the money sit, even through dips."
03/23/2021,stocks,"There’s a r/daytrading sub. A couple of them do it full time. Those people usually have robust real time software often connected with their brokerages. It can cost thousands for subscriptions to Bloomberg terminals, etc. 

Their methods vary. Some look at 30s-1m candles. Some look at volume. Really depends. It’s not for everyone though (including me). When you get burned for 30% randomly it fucking hurts. You realize how useless paper trading experience is when you’re throwing all of your money into some no name stock that crashes on bad news out of nowhere when you’re just trying to get in and out."
03/23/2021,stocks,Took me 3 years
03/23/2021,stocks,"If you’re trying to chase the next pop, trust me it rarely happens... just believe in the research done for a particular stock and be prepared to hold! Overnight successes takes many failed days so stay strong. Just for context, what kind of stocks were you invested in ?"
03/23/2021,stocks,"How the hell have you lost money over the last year? Stop trading, start investing"
03/23/2021,stocks,"Have you tried investing? It's a lot simpler if you follow the basic rules, has much lower risk and requires much less time. Anyone can do it."
03/23/2021,stocks,Lol I’d live been losing for over a year now
03/23/2021,stocks,4
03/23/2021,stocks,"1st. look and listen to the guys here.  A lot of them have been doing this for a long time and give great advice and have extensive knowledge on how a stock will or won't do.
2nd. Create a good diversified portfolio.  You can choose some for day trading but look more in to long term investing. Again, that's where these guys come in handy.  They know which ones will pay off in the long run.
3rd.  Know you're not going to become a millionaire overnight.  A lot of hype is being given to stocks like GME but that is a total flook thing and some people just got lucky.
Keep studying and reading.  I try to learn a new technique at least once a week and then I'll put it to use."
03/23/2021,stocks,I’ve heard this guy FT71 (Futurestrader 71) who managed prop firms say without professional coaching 5-8 years. Your goal is to not blow up your account in 5 to 8 years and manage risk
03/23/2021,stocks,Go to bank
03/23/2021,stocks,Short answer. FOREVER
03/23/2021,stocks,"I don't think you should give up on trading per say but you might want to consider a change in your strategy. Several folks here have given good ideas. If you want to generate consistent results consider shifting a portion of your account into a few different etf or traditional mutual funds that mirror the various indexes. Its not glamorous but they will produce results. If you continuously contribute to these weekly biweekly or monthly long term you will make a decent return. Next I would focus on picking 4-5 stocks that interest you. These could be any decent sized company that interests you. Maybe they offer a quarterly div, or you think the product they will be releasing will do really well. The idea is that these become medium to long term holdings. If you buy enough shares you could even use those to sell covered calls that could make you more money. Next if your still not having enough fun with options consider buying 1-3 short term stocks. These are the stocks that are down but could bounce back. Since you are looking to make a quick play on these make sure you set your limits and stick to them."
03/23/2021,stocks,"I can’t remember the name of study but it went something like this: 

A team of researchers asked for day traders to volunteer themselves for a study, a little over 1000 day traders volunteered. They tracked their gains/losses over 1 year. The researches found that I believe 90% of them lost money over that year, 9% made money but failed to beat the market, and 0.99%  beat the market but failed to make enough money to live off of. While 1 person beat the market and made enough money to live off of for one year. (These numbers aren’t exact but you get the idea) 

However we all know the majority day traders lose money. That wasn’t the interesting part. The interesting part was that 75% of the day traders in the study claimed to have beat the market. Meaning, they couldn’t adequately calculate their gains/losses. 

Another interesting fact that’s now been proven in this study as well as other studies is that...there’s no evidence of learning when it comes to day trading. The longer you do it, you don’t become better.

Edit: So TLDR; you don’t become better with time."
03/23/2021,stocks,took me 25 years of trial and error
03/23/2021,stocks,Numbers say you are unlikely to do it on your own. Best chance is to find a mentor that’s been trading successfully for 20+ years
03/23/2021,stocks,"You know whats predictable and consistent? dividends..

Just don't be a trader, buy and hold for the longterm, less work,less headache and more consistent income. Use a small portion of your portfolio for trading if you must."

03/23/2021,stocks,"I began in August slowly adding until I had 52K . Trade mostly pennystocks since mid-Nov but now at $170K. Was at 235K 1/26 but just like it shot up in Jan it shot down in Feb and now slowly recovering. Earlier this week was over $180K.

03/23/2021,stocks,"Probably because that’s really really boring. I know it works but I don’t think anyone gets kicks from buying SPY

Idk about day trading but I honestly can’t blame someone for wanting to section off part of their portfolio for higher risk plays. I’m thinking more WSB stuff than day trading though. I have no idea why anyone would want to day trade. It’s a TON of work and doesn’t even generate profit half the time"
03/23/2021,stocks,"The goal of day trading is pretty simple. It's to maximize profits and achieve performance much greater than the s&p500. With proper techniques and risk management it can be done. Many people have been able to do it but it's hard and takes a long time to understand. I myself am currently in the process of trying to be good at swing trading.

Of course many think it's all mumbo jumbo, but again, if it was mumbo jumbo then there wouldn't be many people who have done it successfully"
03/23/2021,stocks,"Just like having an affair so you don't resent your wife, brilliant!"
03/23/2021,stocks,"I like to play around with a little swing trading with under 10% of my account. Doing the above keeps me humble. Being profitable is one thing, outperforming the market is quite another."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Probably did, chasing the game rather than building up a position. I joined late last October but still made gains of about 1,200$. Started off with a small amount as well. Switched my focus onto long term holds now."
03/23/2021,stocks,"it might be incredibly boring, but might be more worthwhile to do that than to study every day for 3 hours just to lose 40% of your investment.

especially considering OP admits hes only been trading for about a year... pretty much any buy and hold investment made a year ago would be up 100% from their year ago price. would probably be better for him to do basic investments while he's learning.

i can't imagine what hes poring over for 3+ hours to lose money in this market, unless he really only started in the past 3 months. i agree it's boring, and thats why i have a separate swing trade account  that's maybe 10% of my main investing account just so i dont run into this issue"
03/23/2021,stocks,"There aren’t that many people who’ve done (or are doing) it successfully. Pretty much every statistic will tell you that. 

Especially considering all other factors besides just being net positive. Did you outperform the market? Far enough to justify the significantly higher risk? Made enough profit over market to justify all the hours you put into it, as well as the mental stress? What‘s it look like after taxes?"
03/23/2021,stocks,"Yea if you’re talking about your “fun money” I see no issue, but it would still piss me off to compare my return vs VOO."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Understood.  You started late in the bull run so don’t feel to down.  Yeah; if you aren’t cut out to be a trader, don’t try to be a trader.  Building wealth is a long and consistent process.  No matter what you see on WSB; the vast majority lose money."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Yeah and there aren't many people who successfully create businesses. It's the same thing. Many things worth doing are very hard to be successful at. But all of you guys with a losers mentality can keep downvoting me.

The goal of day trading is to significantly outperform the market, and as I said many people are successful at it (i know statistically it's a small percentage but there are still various people who are good at it) . You can look at gains online of various people who openly display them. Look at the US investing championship for example. After taxes, it doesn't really matter everyone goes through taxes it's just more paperwork. sure you don't have long term capital gains but when you significantly outperform the market the taxes aren't going to mean much. As for whether it's worth the risk, people who day trade properly and make consistent profits have proper risk management. A successful day trader should never have significant drawdowns that destroys a portfolio. 

And just because you view it as mental stress doesn't mean someone else would. I personally view sitting in an office 8 hours a day way more depressing and stressful than being able to work for yourself."
03/23/2021,stocks,"I’m mentally prepared for corrections as I have managed to see it as a gift, sale sale sale ! But yeah this year has definitely not been as smooth sailing as when I first started."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Bad comparison. According to the Bureau of Labor, 35% of new businesses make it to over 10 years. In contrast to that, most sources state that only 5-10% of day traders make money, some even go as low as 1% who make enough to live off. 

So your chances of becoming a successful business owner are actually more than 5 times higher than those of becoming a profitable day trader. 

And by the way, being realistic isn’t the same as having a loser mentality. It’s actually important in order to even have a chance at being a winner, especially when it comes to fact-based stuff like trading."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Statistically, a wicked small percentage of people are really good at winning the lottery. Because skill?"
03/23/2021,stocks,"The business owner was an example off the top of my head and even your stat shows the odds are against you. The statistic also didn't really even show exactly how successful those businesses were of the 35%. Not to mention there could be variables to owning a businesses vs trading stocks that make people less successful that you didn't even think of. For example, one variable could be people go in wanting to gamble rather than wanting to learn to trade without emotions. Plus you're acting like day trading is the equivalent to being a pro athlete. There's no intangible athleticism you need to be born with all you need is a brain and discipline. But I'll just let you do you and run away from any opportunity you might like because it's statistically difficult to accomplish."
03/23/2021,stocks,This statement shows you don't have an understanding of statistics whatsoever. A successful day trader makes a high amount of trades over their lifetime. The chances of someone getting lucky every month for the entirety of their life is essentially 0. Look at any successful day trader who shows their results online and if you think it's luck when they continue doing it year after year then you're just ignorant. You can't say the same thing about the lottery there is no individual who consistently wins the lottery year after year. There's almost no one who even wins more than once
2021-03-23 14:30:17,stocks,"Good idea to ""park"" funds in a dividend stock While the market trades sideways, is it a good idea to deposit 20% of the portfolio in a company like AT&T so that it grows and also gets a dividend? And sell from time to time to buy the dips in growth stocks. Is this fairly common?"
03/23/2021,stocks,"Would not do it with a single stock, maybe with a dividend / value etf"
03/23/2021,stocks,"not sure that is the best idea, because the stock you""park"" your money in, will not necessarily stay flat with the market,  if it trades down, you lose capital (unrealized) and the dividend can get cut as well.  AT&T have they ever cut or suspended the dividend?  just a thought.  if you think the market is sideways, nothing wrong with having cash"
03/23/2021,stocks,Except att hasn’t grown at all from 3 years ago
03/23/2021,stocks,Give SCHD a look.
03/23/2021,stocks,"Yeah it’s a good idea in a general sense. Doing that for only one stock introduces extra risk though. 

I have about a quarter of my portfolio in dividend stocks spread across different sectors.  T, ABBV, Oil (RDS, XOM, CVX, etc.), REIT’s (MAIN, BDN), PSEC (Risky high interest loans great div), semiconductor/tech (QCOM, INTC, TSM, TXN), LMT.  If you can get past the squick factor, MO pays a great dividend. If you pick an ETF, you get a spread of stocks but pay a percentage for maintenance that can eat into your growth; you also can’t control for higher risk, higher dividends. If you pick your own stocks you can go for higher or lower risk with associated dividends, growth, or mixed div and growth.

Many of the large cap ETF’s and mutual funds also capture dividends which can be reinvested or taken for profit."
03/23/2021,stocks,Park it in UWMC. Pays nearly 5% but has ability to run 50% easy. Growth and dividend.
03/23/2021,stocks,"I always treat dividend stock as ""alternative to cash"".

They won't get me rich, but if there is drawdown in my growth stock, then i can liquidate some of my dividend stock to average down.

and usually dividend stock are much more resilient than growth stock."
03/23/2021,stocks,No because the share price drops by the amount of the dividend on the Ex date.
03/23/2021,stocks,Probably better off parking cash in a dividend ETF instead of an individual stock
03/23/2021,stocks,"Originally I doubted the need to be invested in dividend stocks (I'm 25). However in uncertain times I have been buying dividend stocks and holding them guaranteeing that profit (about 20% of my total portfolio). Have to say it makes me feel a lot more comfortable when the bulk of my portfolio is swinging up and down in the current market.

I focus on UK dividends as I'm UK based but have been loving Persimmon (home builder) and British American Tobacco lately. Have my dividend portfolio spread over 6 or so high dividend yielders - Managed to pickup some legal and general when it was crashing due to covid, now got a 50% gain and a 10% yearly dividend yield and my buy in - woof"
03/23/2021,stocks,I would not say it is common.  I don't even think it is a good idea.  Any stock could take a down turn and you are still investing in that company not just the dividend.  A better option that most people do to make extra money when they think the market is going sideways is to sell covered calls out of the money.
03/23/2021,stocks,"If you're still young and planning for retirement absolutely. If T remains flat, after 30 years you'll be getting about a 30% return yearly."
03/23/2021,stocks,It is common.  It's what we're seeing a lot of now in fact
03/23/2021,stocks,"I would not do that to be honest. There is the certain risk, that the stock loses value, which is kinda bad if you then have to sell it because you want to invest it elsewhere. In addition to that, you pay transaction costs of 1-2% per trade, which is also lost money. It's like a cheese grater, the more you move capital back and forth, the more you pay in commissions and taxes."
03/23/2021,stocks,I have a separate portfolio which consists largely of high yield monthly dividend ETFs which I have a fair chunk of my money parked in and am pretty happy with.
03/23/2021,stocks,SPYD
03/23/2021,stocks,"This is certainly safer but a very different play.

Even the ""high div"" ETFs don't even come close to $T's div yield."
03/23/2021,stocks,What's your favorite dividend etf?
03/23/2021,stocks,Care to elaborate? Isn’t at&t a high yield dividend stock?
03/23/2021,stocks,"I like PFFA, which is an ETF consisting of preferred stock and currently yields ~8% and pays out monthly."
03/23/2021,stocks,"AT&T has had an increasing dividend for 36 years in a row.  A cut or freeze is always possible, just less likely with a dividend aristocrat."
03/23/2021,stocks,"The growth in at&t is 7% more shares every year. If you held for those 3 years you'd have about 25% gains and they compound.  Sideways charts are good for high dividends. 

After about 12 years, you'll be making about 15% of your original investment a year in T.  25 years, 30%, 40 years 60% a year."
03/23/2021,stocks,"For people reading, keep this in mind and look at dividend.com to see how many days it takes for it to recover."

03/23/2021,stocks,"Yes they fall by the dividend amount, but arent we also assuming we experience any capital appreciation? I mean even with dividend growth being a target, no one wants a $5/share stock to fall by the amount of the yield and then not go to $6 next week"

Yeah but the OP is investing in T stock because of the dividend....


> I mean even with dividend growth being a target, no one wants a $5/share stock to fall by the amount of the yield and then not go to $6 next week


I think you need to read up. You seem misinformed. If you want I can explain but usually if one doesn’t understand they just dig their heels in.

Here’s an informative video if you want to educate yourself."
03/23/2021,stocks,How much do you pay if you dont use a PFOF broker where you get frontrunned by HFT?
03/23/2021,stocks,Europe is rather capital market averse in comparison to the US. Reflects in the fees I assume.
03/23/2021,stocks,"Im not educated on dividends? Ok bud. I think you missed what i was trying to say. I watched the video. The takeaway was that dividends shouldn’t be so critical in picking “winning stocks” but is still important to returns. I don’t disagree with his summation at all. I wouldnt only pick a stock simply because it pays me a high yield (per T) but if we assume capital appreciation is also why we’re investing, it’s not that dividends cant be pursued if your DD validates your choosing of a stock.

Edit: punctuation"
03/23/2021,stocks,"> Im not educated on dividends? 


I never said that. But ok. 


> but is still important to returns. 


Nobody is saying they aren’t. If I sell shares and don’t reinvest the cash then yeah I’ll hurt my returns. 


> I wouldnt only pick a stock simply because it pays me a high yield (per T) 


This is what the OP is doing...and why I commented the way I did."

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

03/23/2021,stocks,"**Stock Market Weather Forecast**

Today's going to be super hard to predict. Here's what I know:

* Bond yields are down and should continue to drop today and probably tomorrow.
* [Terrible economic data](https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-economy-currentaccount/u-s-current-account-deficit-jumps-to-12-year-high-in-2020-idUSL1N2LK1K0) keeps coming out, but the market is completely ignoring all of it.
* J. Pow and the Feds are performing for the House today and the Senate tomorrow.
* Yesterday was bullish, but we hit a major resistance line and failed to get past it.
* Pre-market is bullish, but it's putting us right below that resistance line today - which means that, if we don't get past it, we might dive down again.

That's a lot of pressure in both directions, which usually results in a pretty sideways day. My guess is that we're just going to re-explore yesterday's highs and lows today, most likely ending a little bit red.

I'm predicting a **red day** with a NASDAQ **high of 13,429** and a **low of 13,274**.

Dish hasn't bought n26 from the new T-Mobile yet, but it also acts as further confirmation that they plan to since there's no reason to include it otherwise.

Good sign to not expect further delays in their network build IMO.

EDIT: Correction-the FCC just APPROVED their application, so from the FCC's perspective they can deploy whenever they want.

To close a option spread position, do you have to put in 2 transactions manually, instead of closing both legs in 1 order? For example, for a credit spread, you need to buy back a put option you previously sold at a high strike, and simultaneously sell the put option you bought earlier at a low strike.

Also, Fidelity says contract fees only apply to opening but not closing options, but I am still being charged $0.65 for buy or sell to close, what am I missing?"

https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/softbank-backed-zymergen-files-for-%24100-mln-u.s.-ipo-2021-03-23

The concept has a high ceiling, even though it won't happen overnight we're going to have to move towards non-petroleum based materials for more things as recycling doesn't really seem as feasible as a lot of people used to think. Website has some sleek (but mostly not ready for commercial use) concepts

https://www.zymergen.com/

Aside from having Softbank as a backer they list Sumitomo Chemicals which is huge for consumer materials in Japan. 

I think like a lot of sustainable products, the key is finding some luxury products where consumers are willing to pay a premium for the new angle while you develop it into something that's more broadly commercially viable. Then the sustainability premium eventually comes down as you can continue R&D and get some economies of scale over time."

However, the shock of actually making money gives me a heart attack. I fall unconscious and end up in the hospital. When I wake up the following day, I see that my calls would have given me 10000% returns had I sold before close, but because I was unconscious I couldn't, and I don't have the money to exercise them (I spent all my money on the calls themselves and have left with which to buy actual SPY shares).

""The MARKET is penciling in federal raises in 2022, even though Powell has stated 20 times it will be 2023. What if today he says 2022? Go buy your boomer stocks, technology isn't safe.""

Republicans start the hearing, complain and bitch. Stocks hit a low point on the day. I buy.

Powell talks, reiterates that everything is ahead of schedule and we're doing good, all things considered, but still need to focus on unemployment for 2021.

Stocks go up.

Maybe you can't time the market, but I timed the last few Powell speeches this way. It's also easy because I believe in what he's saying and doing, especially over the doomsayer noise. Roku's already up 6 dollars from one hour ago."

03/23/2021,stocks,"Most people should just dump their money into an index fund.

They say ""you can't beat the market"". I don't think that's 100% true -- I think that, if you really study the market, you can learn it well enough to outsmart most of Wall Street and outpace the S&P 500. But I also think that doing that is really, really hard.

They also say that ""only a few people pull it off"" -- which I don't think means that *you* can't pull it off. I think means that *anyone* can pull it off, but most people give up before they learn enough to do it.

You wouldn't perform surgery without spending 7 years in med school. If you're going to try to beat the market, spend time studying it. Use a paper trading account and try every single strategy you learn en masse to see if it really works for you or not, and start investing with real money when you're confident that you have a strategy that will beat the market.

Or just put your money into an index fund. It's a lot easier."

03/23/2021,stocks,"I invested for about a year and a few months. I was up 50% and after today I’m down to 20% gains. I.e. Started with 20K went to 30k and now sitting around 24K. Wishing I pulled out of the market completely as I had a gut feeling we would hit turbulence with how many green weeks we have been seeing. 

I mean the real sign for me was when stocks grew way higher than their pre-covid level. No way is a business like Disney growing at a crazy enough rate to warrant being worth 60% more than last year when their amusements parks have been shutdown and a streaming service that’s only thriving because everyone is shut in the house with their kids.

My only tip that has led to my success was selling for modest gains and not getting too greedy. Don’t sell when a stock dips randomly, hold. 

Do research and due diligence. Buy on dips (except don’t right now cause this shit is looking unpredictable). 

Buying during pre-market is high volatility. It either can soar high or dip low. Midday is the best in purchasing a stock to make sure you don’t lose a percentage or two. If a stock is getting hyped though buy during premarket as it will likely soar.

Also exercise day trades if you have the capital. It’s worth it."

as you quoted, they said the fed will continue providing support as they have been, they don't expect inflation, and they have a plan ready if prices go up.

outside of that, nothing relevant really came form the hearing. a congressman whined about the salt cap and was basically told that it's something for  congress to figure out and is none of the fed/treasury's business, and they briefly discussed rule6 and confirmed that the fed is looking into it but ultimately feels congress needs to be the one doing something on that front."

Sometimes, from being so hurt by past purchases, I buy in at a tenth of a share at a time just in case it starts dropping."
03/23/2021,stocks,"im on the same boat. I started trading early Feb and I am down a lot. Now holding NIO, DM, PLTR, AAPL,  ARKG and Lucid"
03/23/2021,stocks,"DCA down if you believe this companies, it's an opportunity.

But, I think we have we a 50/50 chance of these stocks to crash further - NIO down to 20, AAPL sub 100, PLTR down to 12-15. The reason I get mocked for these targets is because people are so emotionally invested in the current (Still) overvaluation. these are the targets IF these companies achieve their crazy milestones over the next few years and should therefore be the baseline valuation (maybe not apple though). Remember, this is NORMAL. during the dot com bust spec stocks dropped over 80-90%. people are forgetting this. 

The WSB community is going to be in for a wicked surprise if these stocks drop to these levels, and its going to push a whole segment of people away from investing forever. 99% of the WSB community would NEVER imagine stocks dropping that low. its nightmare fuel. Imagine starting to invest in Feb and being 70-80% down on your positions of NIO/PLTR with no seemingly end in sight, and at the same time seeing boomer stocks recover and push to ATHs. its enough to make anyone go mad. But that's when you BUY."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Don't listen to anyone saying it's a ladder attack. Ladder attacks aren't real. 

When you see this, it usually indicates indecision. Traders in general are waiting to see what the stock is going to do before they get in or out so the volume is low. Low volume means there can be a wider spread between the bid and ask, so the price might move significantly simply because of the spread. But it can, and often does, reverse very quickly"
03/23/2021,stocks,Because the bids put in by buyers are significantly lower than the sellers' asking prices.  Lower volume = each order has a larger impact.

That’s before the 3 trillion infrastructure bill that might further drive building material prices way up, real estate/home building stocks are facing uncertainly. Recent weather also causing drop in new house being built or purchased. New covid wave might also contribute to some further disruption in supply chain that drive some prices up."
03/23/2021,stocks,Combination of inflation fear and end-of-quarter rebalancing/profit taking. My guess is the rest of the week will trade similarly before hopefully things turn around in April as we enter a new quarter and move beyond the inflation fear.
03/23/2021,stocks,"I know for a fact they were pushing 110 a few weeks ago but I just checked their chart on robinhood and its not showing them over 80 at any point. Did they do a stock split?

03/23/2021,stocks,I don't think they've bottomed out but it's a good time to pick up companies that you think will last. Think of it like the dot com boom and how there was a lot of hype but only some last

As far as Long term.  The smarter folks here say the travel stocks won’t be good as far as their financials due to the amount of debt they are incurring over the last year.  I wouldn’t be surprised to see some share dilution to raise capital which would raise the amount of shares available and make the existing shares worth less( not worthless, worth space less)"

03/23/2021,stocks,What does that mean?
03/23/2021,stocks,"Terrible idea. This rarely works out for the better as you never get back in at a good time and then have to buy stocks at a higher price. Instead, learn to ride out the volatility. It takes guts to own a lot of stocks, because inevitably some of them will be in the red."
03/23/2021,stocks,"If your positions are long term investments, just take a break by looking away. You will thank yourself after 5 years, when looking back to today."
03/23/2021,stocks,"This is essentially trying to time the market. Are you willing to risk even more if your prediction that the market will go even lower turns out to be wrong?

If you want to take a breather, it's probably better to just not check your portfolio for a while. You get depleted after a while of seeing constant seesawing, since the negative feelings from drops outweighs the positives from small jumps. Acting on the feeling that you are burnt out is not a good strategy, as in general it's not good to base decisions on emotions here."
03/23/2021,stocks,Worst idea in the world. What are you invested in? Is it tech heavy ?
03/23/2021,stocks,"It’s probably not the best idea unless you’re absolutely exhausted. At least keep 25% or so invested in case of any potential pops. Or you could merely set some stops and limits, then walk away"

talking heads and carebears say he said this, but didnt say this to alleviate concerns about something unrelated, so the market is going down.

That said I don't think she is Warren Buffet material. It doesn't take a genius to know where future tech is going, the hard part is timing and tbh that is just luck or sticking around for long enough.

For instance we had green energy, EV and a lot of nascent biotech pre-08 crash. Many of those stocks are still around now and just reaching their pre-crash levels. If Cathie invested then she ultimately would have been right but saw horrible returns until over a decade after."

03/23/2021,stocks,"Hmm, yes reopening too fast right now is definitely a dumb idea. But, the problem in Europe is that we don't have enough vaccines, most governments here screwed up. So, I assume the fear is more that it's going to take us longer to recover from COVID compared to the US. IMO, the US is already approaching at a super fast speed and by Summer y'all are going to be good to reopen most things again and resume a lot of vacation stuff. Here in Europe however nobody knows if they're going to manage to give the vaccine to enough people before holiday season starts, hell there are people who are in their 80s and didn't receive the vaccine yet, it's pretty crazy."

03/23/2021,stocks,Yea but i'm guessing the bots saw news about Powell speaking and auto sold because they associate powell speaking with red? idk lol
03/23/2021,stocks,"I understand what you're saying intellectually. It's not money I really need soon. It's just that I'm down like 10% and green days never get me back on top before red days take me lower. So emotionally, it's hard to not feel like I should've gotten out sooner, you know?"
03/23/2021,stocks,People made a lot because investors panic sold to avoid tremendous losses. Hedge funds and many saw the oversell and bought the dip. Unfortunately the addition of retail investors has hyped up the market too much and this could be the correction. No established company should be worth way more than their pre-covid levels. I.e. Disney.
03/23/2021,stocks,"> You will have a couple of slightly red weeks, a couple of slightly green weeks.

03/23/2021,stocks,"I think your targets are set far too low. Any push below 22 would be considered a steal for many with PLTR, I'd imagine 35 would be the floor for NIO before a recovery. NIO tends to move with Tesla, if Tesla moves up, NIO will follow suit. PLTR tends to do its own thing when there's no news, but given that they have a demo day in only a couple of weeks, I wouldn't be surprised if a turn around is inbound pretty soon"

03/23/2021,stocks,"Yep. Every single red day, I add more BEAM. Plan to do this every red day this year. Just fractions of shares. Planning to hold for yeeeeeaaaaaaarrrsssss. I believe in this stock long term. Like Google levels of share price. And impact on our world."

03/23/2021,stocks,"I got in with MSOS at early Feb, so I'm legit looking at a $50 average share price. Haven't been able to DCA very much because I focused on diversifying, since I of course had a lot of tech as well.

Accidentally timed the peak almost perfectly."

03/23/2021,stocks,"Thanks for the encouragement. Today was just brutal. I only have a small account and am trying to just keep adding to it.

03/23/2021,stocks,I really would not. Legacy car makers are going to get a huge reality check next year. Big competition from china and tesla. Margins will be lower. They WILL lose market share. The only way they survive is if they cannibalize each other.

03/23/2021,stocks,"He's pulling this out of his ***.

It's possible that you see some kind of a tax hike, but you are several months away from it, IF it even happens at all. Everybody really needs to stop thinking that it is imminent.

The American Rescue Plan was fairly slow. I'm expecting infrastructure and taxes?? (I'm putting ??'s because I don't know if you'll see the same plan in the end) to be even slower than this plan.

Plus, wouldn't you think, given that the market likes to price things in ahead of time, that the Georgia election results that were now MONTHS ago would have been a cue to start positioning for this. As with Manchin, it's fairly obvious that it is mostly theater from him. He will say that he wants to do something, but for the most part, he will likely sign on to doing something that mainstream D's want."
03/23/2021,stocks,"DId you even read, that's gonna make companies that haven't IPO'd yet to IPO in a foreign country with lower taxes."
03/23/2021,stocks,"1. There is another reconciliation and I expect them to try to use it, the only thing is, it's several months from now.

2. With Manchin, it's more theater than ""he'll actually block things"", at least that's how it's looked so far. I do not expect the tax hike that has been paraded around to remain the same if it happens, but the Georgia senate races put the possibility of tax hikes SQUARELY on the table."
03/23/2021,stocks,BUt what he really means is : im a Russian sleeper agent who will increase rates when you least suspect it.
03/23/2021,stocks,"For now, i'd hate to sell my speculative holdings and see them moon, so i think i'll keep holding, but for any future money i'll deposit it be 100% index."
03/23/2021,stocks,"It's typically been a FUD sell off before he talks, then rebound while he talks. That started today, then took we had a major dip for no reason.

Best theory so far I've seen is just capital gains re balancing"
03/23/2021,stocks,"Maybe your point would be right if we weren't in the quarter-end rebalancing period after a big spike in bond yields and after small caps had an absolutely fantastic quarter.

This is simply big funds rebalancing, which in this case means selling stocks. Nothing more to it at all."

03/23/2021,stocks,"Yep, them being based in Taiwan is very important geopolitically as well.  I think it's safe to say $TSM is undervalued at this point, the only question is how much do they bounce back up and when.  EDIT: Also really like $INTC as well."

03/23/2021,stocks,"Yup, I bought the dip lol. Just a bunch of panic sellers, which I guess makes me a panic buyer 😝"

03/23/2021,stocks,"Yep, this is me. I would set my limit and then see it start going up, so I'd move my limit up a little bit. Then I'd see it go down, so I'd move it down a little bit. Finally I'd just give up and FOMO into it only for it to drop below what I bought it at."
03/23/2021,stocks,"That's the issue. You don't know where that peak is, but it should be a consolation for those thinking this spells the end of the world."
03/23/2021,stocks,"It's not instant. The chart you're looking at for SPY is monthly, which means you might see little upward movement this week or next week, but over the course of the next year, it could be indicative of a bull run. Of course, its not perfect, there were 2 cases where the market moved down, but it goes up much more often than it goes down."

03/23/2021,stocks,"Even if you arent in the green this year and there is a major crash, are you retiring this year or very soon? If not just keep your money in and let it ride and you'll be better off in the long run. That is unless you're throwing money into memes"

03/23/2021,stocks,fuking commies!!!!
03/23/2021,stocks,I agree with this. I’m not too worried about NIO and PLTR long term and of course AAPL will just do it’s thing. I’m most concerned about PLUG tho.
03/23/2021,stocks,"Idk. 

Valuations of spec stocks are dependent on certain factors which could change. 

I wouldn't be surprised either way"
03/23/2021,stocks,"22 is still highly overvalued territory, for the 3-5 year timeframe and it requires PLTR to hit all their aggressive milestones. People think PLTR is a steal at 22 because they look at the support levels on the chart, but this support was formed based on meme euphoria and not aggressive forward growth. PLTR above 22 is based on aggressive forward growth that far exceeds even PLTRS aggressive model.

You are also assuming TESLA will move up.

Obviously, looking at PLTR 7-10 years out, it has tremendous potential, but these things take time. I'm JUST saying those are my PLTR targets for the near term, and looking at the long term I'm loading up like crazy as I see the disruptive potential up this company. If they deliver on their promise it will be immense (I'm talking 500bil+cap)"
03/23/2021,stocks,That's fine too. Just want to change the name Istanbul back to Constantinople
03/23/2021,stocks,"I think it's a good time to get in. The problem with it is how much it includes PLUG, but plug is tanked right now so probably safe entry at this point."
03/23/2021,stocks,"it's got room to run downwards, chart does not look great. my icln calls are getting killed right now."
03/23/2021,stocks,You think it can’t get worse but just you wait - nah in all seriousness I can’t see it being an issue long term
03/23/2021,stocks,I’m heavy TSM. Just added 5 shares at $109.3 tho so I can’t really complain. TSM dropped 5% in AH alone.
03/23/2021,stocks,Everythings down. S&P is only up because tech is carrying right now.
03/23/2021,stocks,twins!
03/23/2021,stocks,Yeah I should've got in a couple months ago since that's one of the few channels I constantly watch..easily worth the upgrade to plus for me  when it was announced.
03/23/2021,stocks,Your comment makes me want to pick up more BEAM! I want to hold it for a long time too.
03/23/2021,stocks,If you're that bullish on BEAM surely you should be more interested in ARKG which seems to have a superior future?
03/23/2021,stocks,"I think Microsoft is also an excellent buy. The internet & cloud computing are the future and Microsoft are one of the main players in this space. I've worked in so many sectors yet their software is integral everywhere, plus I think that Xbox Game Pass is going to be absolutely huge in a growing gaming industry. Definitely can't go wrong with Microsoft.

I'm still coming to grips with the science behind genomics tbh but my brother works in the field and he's very bullish on both BEAM and CRSP. The fact ARKG have been going heavy on BEAM and their lower market cap causing big dips during this period is the only I've picked them up first. I do plan to pick up CRSP too. I need to do more research on NTLA. I would probably prefer to get ARKG if I could but unfortunately I'm in the UK and it's not available with my broker."
03/23/2021,stocks,"How risky we talking? What 3 stocks are you looking at?

The more money you put into a stock, the more money you'll potentially make."
03/23/2021,stocks,"With $1200, spreading it out you’re gonna make next to nothing with 12 different companies worth of stock. When you’re trying to preserve your money in the market, then yes you wanna spread risk out more but when you’re trying to make money(I assume you are with $1200) then you’ll see bigger G/L’s with only a few companies. I personally am a small investor and I have about 95% of my portfolio in AMD."
03/23/2021,stocks,"depends how lazy you are.

for example, I bought 5 video game stocks, but only 3 of them hit. had I researched better, I would have known just to put money into EA and Take Two not those and others like Ubisoft etc"
03/23/2021,stocks,"Im new, care to explain why? You don't have to sell right? Or is it bcs of options?"
03/23/2021,stocks,"That part of the month is just the time period where you see the most options interest, as you can buy the options on this day of each month every year well in advance, up to at least a year out."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Not familiary with the small cap but as far as the ETF, you did buy the top a bit, but you should see gains worth realizing before too long.  I'm expecting some positive movement next month.

Good that your trying to frame a solid port."
03/23/2021,stocks,Hey for a stack I'd consider selling too. Who knows tho it always seems like you sell when you shouldnt and you hold when you should have sold
03/23/2021,stocks,Unless you are in OIL you will probably be fine but you've picked some wild sectors to go all in on.
03/23/2021,stocks,"Ya it's a mess. You might need to wait a couple days for settlement, maybe just try tomorrow, although I think settlement is 2 days"
03/23/2021,stocks,"Do they say how much is needed when they say it's insufficient? Could it be that it's multiplying your limit buy price by 100, and you don't have that much?"
03/23/2021,stocks,You must not be American. No one here is buying a Chinese car over a Ford or GM. No one.
03/23/2021,stocks,"Ford has huge EV potential and a dedicated consumer base though. Their trucks and SUV’s (including Lincoln) are increasing in popularity as family vehicles. Their vans are top of the line for small to large scale commercial needs. And on top of there’s the new Bronco, new F-150, and don’t forget their lending business is doing great as well."

03/23/2021,stocks,"Lmao, someone is salty."
03/23/2021,stocks,"This is pretty vague. It's not exactly counter to what I'd like to see as far as policy goes, but it's hard to say how I feel about it when it's mostly a bunch of slogans about progressive taxation and investment in sustainable agriculture/tech.

03/23/2021,stocks,"Tax hikes, see it before i believe it. Especially a corporate tax hike. These guys literally get their positions because of corp friends. Inflation story is just losing its traction, they needed to come up with something fast. Pretty weak story though."
03/23/2021,stocks,"I don’t think that’ll happen very often, although I’m sure some companies will consider or actually leave to avoid taxation.  Right now, Yellen is talking to other nations about establishing minimum corporate taxation to avoid this scenario.

And yeah I read what you said, but I don’t think fears of corporate tax increases are the primary driver right now. I think there’s still some overall economic anxiety from a few fronts, and maybe that’s just one."

03/23/2021,stocks,"so, a month and a half in, they're still rebalancing? are they... purposely waiting for the price to dip more and more? this logic is strange to me. why wouldn't they ""rebalance"" all at the peak, instead of now, a good chunk lower than before? i'm not doubting i just find this a weird concept to wrap my head around"
03/23/2021,stocks,Exactly. Great time to pick off some deals before hopefully we can start moving beyond this in Q2/April.
03/23/2021,stocks,You're probably right I'm just surprised that those things would trump water supply in a business that should have good margins going forward. Skilled labor is important but I'd think they'd be cannibalizing each other for the same workers. But obviously the people running these companies have a better idea than I do.
03/23/2021,stocks,I’m going to sound like a dick here but how much did you expect it to grow in the space of a month? I bought in exactly the same time as you at $130 and all I’ve been doing is averaging down. TSM shares have dropped because Intel are investing in their own fabs so they’ve basically just lost a customer but if you research you will see that there is basically a giant queue outside TSM HQ of potential customers begging to be served but TSM can’t because of backlogs. Long term they will do nothing but grow.
03/23/2021,stocks,Bloomberg or you can google it
03/23/2021,stocks,"You can find it on Tradingview or Investing app. Both do a good job, but Tradingview updates it as it happens"
03/23/2021,stocks,"Get over your CNBC hate

03/23/2021,stocks,I don’t like them either but they’re good for one thing and that’s quick data for bonds and futures with the app.
03/23/2021,stocks,"Their proprietary CPUs that they dropped last year blew the expectations out of the water, and all it really is is an iPad chip. Once they fab a real computer level processor, I think it’s going to be insane."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Yes, here in Canada too. Slow as donkeys"
03/23/2021,stocks,"> you been able to time the dips for any sector? i can safely say my btc gains haven’t dropped below +10% yet

You either went in after the initial crash or invested after the covid crash.

Telling people to buy in *now* because it's still a safe haven is terrible advice.

Going to +10% is pretty horrible for an asset that's up 732% for the year btw."
03/23/2021,stocks,Indeed I do. Or maybe Whatsapp. OP was mistaken and I copied that mistake.
03/23/2021,stocks,It finished at 32.50 on the day 😂
03/23/2021,stocks,"Agreed, with a long enough time horizon you'll be back in the green as long as you're not holding complete trash. Just could be several more weeks or even months of this type of action, which will be like a kick in the nuts to retail traders who have just jumped into the markets post covid crash"
03/23/2021,stocks,Aight I got it! Misunderstood you :)
03/23/2021,stocks,"Thank you, thank you, thank you!
It worked!"
03/23/2021,stocks,"Ya, you may be in for a rude awakening, but you could just as easily be correct with what you have to say. I don't think China will let NIO fall. It will send a horrible look their way. PLTR works off contracts that are usually expensive, but come around only so often. They have been putting in a lot of capital into research over the past few years, and I think this investment will pay off. I'm waiting for Demo Day, I anticipate an upward push, but I think you're calling an end to these stocks way too soon. The majority of stocks on my watchlist are down, a couple with good earnings. All growth stocks are down right now, I think we will see a recovery, maybe not to the same ATHs as we seen in February, but I think we're bottoming out"
03/23/2021,stocks,What's PLUG's deal?  Hoping for an upswing soon?
03/23/2021,stocks,"I always here people talk about calls, what are they? And fuck that sucks, hopefully not too far down."
03/23/2021,stocks,Thought it was weird that it started dipping just before Biden go in office.....

03/23/2021,stocks,bc currently im losing like 7K on days like this and only gaining 3K or so on up days which ends up costing me money per week
03/23/2021,stocks,"True, but we're talking 100+k options opened not 1k. Doesn't that imply someone woth a bog speculation about the share price?"
03/23/2021,stocks,"I totally did foresee it going down. I'm 100% aware that decriminalization (not legalization) is month away from being discussed in congress and people would get impatient, so I saw a dip happening. But I didn't expect 15% coupled with all my tech going massively down as well. I just wanted to get started incase I was wrong and it just kept going up.

My plan was to, if I was right about it dipping: let that be offset partially by the rest of my portfolio and then average down. I didn't anticipate everything I own going down by 5-9% and me needing to use that capital to buy other sectors.

Ah well. I'm holding because I'm confident they'll spike up when legislation is on the table. But it sucks."
03/23/2021,stocks,"The amount it's saying I need is the premium, which my account says I have. I'm guessing the settled status is lies and it will take a few days to actually settle."
03/23/2021,stocks,isn't that what everyone said about Japanese cars?
03/23/2021,stocks,"Electric trucks, especially F-150, will be a huge emerging market. I think the issues ($$$) these major automakers have will be the logistics of charging stations just as Tesla with theirs."

03/23/2021,stocks,Gigachad self-link enjoyer
03/23/2021,stocks,Not all of us are blessed with the confidence to self-link my son. One day you too will get there.
03/23/2021,stocks,"Don't be shocked if it does.

The Georgia senate races put this possibility squarely on the table and I'd think that the positioning because of this threat would have long started if the people that mattered here were that concerned about it."
03/23/2021,stocks,"> Britain is leaning that way as well.

This isn't true. Deaths and hospital admissions continue to fall with over 23 million having received their first dose of a vaccine. Progress will probably stall though due to the EU blocking vaccine exports as their procurement processes have been so poor that simply stealing vaccines from other countries is preferred now.

You're right about mainland Europe though. Third wave is imminent."
03/23/2021,stocks,"No, no, I'm not saying that this has all been rebalancing. A lot of it is simply a Nasdaq correction, which honestly still looks like it ended in early March with it trying to consolidate now (and I am full aware I might burn myself by saying this).

Big funds and pension funds can't rebalance until the end of the month/quarter, so yes, that means they missed out on selling at the peak for the tech indices and yes, that means they put pressure on the major averages when they do get to doing it."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Just not sure where the deals are tho

Infrastructure and industrials are down but still way way up 

Tech is down a bit, but so overvalued

Dow and s&p are just off aths"
03/23/2021,stocks,"wasn’t really chasing growth although it was my best earner for a bit. i just wasn’t expecting it to tank so hard after seeing it as a safe bet for the biggest holding of my portfolio. i do have some concern with the medium term future on stocks that saw huge gains since early 2020 though, so i guess my thought process is when the dip will end, and how many months or years of opportunity cost will i eat from this, instead of ripping the bandaid off

i’ll probably just hold but unless i sell some other stocks i won’t have much for dip buying"
03/23/2021,stocks,Hungary was smart to bypass EU BS and buy from China and Russia direct.
03/23/2021,stocks,"it’s all a matter of perspective so sorry for giving my opinion on a reddit sub of all places lmao. as someone who knows the market so well what’s the play fam? you on the tech pullback, cyclicals, meme or weed stocks or something more clever? cause all them shits is tanking 

edit: I mean aside from UWMC which I see you like lolz

btw i got in on stocks and crypto in jan instead of continuing to feed my 401k so i am late on it yes"
03/23/2021,stocks,nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
03/23/2021,stocks,"yeah, I 'm totally in agreement with longer term outlook of NIO and PLTR I'm talking shorter term. I'm NOT saying the companies will fail, that's insane. 

however, wall street wants their shareholder gain NOW NOW NOW, and some of these stocks (like PLTR) don't fit into that agenda. they want to get the RIGHT product first and foremost. Peter Thiel basically managed the expectation of wall street by essentially saying ""we aren't doing this for you, f off"". They will pour money into capital research, into ensuring the they retain the right talent (increased compensation/etc.). All these factors will steal money away from profits/revenue in the near term, which will then drive the price lower and lower. 

Amazon was similar - Bezos based their company on a few key disruptive principles and lasers focused on those, profits were secondary. As a result, amazon stuck to its mission and suffered in the short term but gained in the long. 

I see similar for PLTR, and unfortunately I think the investors that are thinking short term on this stock heavily outweigh the true long term. The true long term also eliminates investors who think long term is 3-5 years. long term for this stock is 5+ years. this further eliminates investors. in reality, I'd say the amoutn of investors in this for the true long term is basically Cathie Wood and a smaller minority of WSB.

Keep some cash on the side if this drops to 12-15."
03/23/2021,stocks,"They had a massive runup so were arguably overpriced already and got hit hard during the correction. Then they reported an error in their financial disclosures which spooked the hell out of people with fears of possible delisting.

I am not sure what the future holds for plug, but hopefully good things for the sake of my position in ICLN."
03/23/2021,stocks,"I think it’s just been a rough few months for renewables tbh, they got royally fucked the other week in the dips and it’s been a bit iffy since. Doesn’t really make sense the way bidens been going on about green energy but such is life."
03/23/2021,stocks,wouldn't a shortage boost their value though? supply and demand and whatnot
03/23/2021,stocks,Yeah those are pretty risky
03/23/2021,stocks,"Okay, but as long as you don't sell you should make it back as soon as the market recovers, no?"
03/23/2021,stocks,"Those options could have been opened who knows when.

Could have been opened yesterday, 1 month ago, 3 months ago, or close to last year.

Check out the puts side and the index options too. You see a LOT of options from both sides expire on this day of the month every month."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Japan has a reputation for high-quality goods produced in the most advanced nation on Earth.

China has a reputation for cheap garbage."
03/23/2021,stocks,"I didn’t call you dumb, i said the post is dumb. You are projecting."
03/23/2021,stocks,Yep
03/23/2021,stocks,[deleted]
03/23/2021,stocks,"Tech has a bunch of deals, and I'm picking a little at value."
03/23/2021,stocks,"All I will say is you’re not alone. I bought CRSR, TSM, NIO, PLTR and a few others right before the dip and it’s been painful I won’t lie. But my reasoning for picking those companies hasn’t changed between then and now so I won’t be selling. All I’ve been doing is averaging down with spare cash. If you sell now and the melt up begins next week you’ll hate yourself even more."
03/23/2021,stocks,Not often can that sentence be true
03/23/2021,stocks,And how great thats working for them...
03/23/2021,stocks,"Cash.

You don't always need to have skin in the game and cash is the safest asset when looking at a large pullback. Something that trends -2% per year to inflation is better than taking -25% in a year holding shit that's tanking. Personally for me I'm holding things I believe will do well long term but a lot is in cash right now waiting for good buy in opportunitites."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Well fuck I mean is the future for ICLN looking good at all? Should I just get right back out?  Straight up I did no research on this one, did it off a recommendation so I put in a pretty small stake."
03/23/2021,stocks,Honestly I wouldn't be surprised if investors are waiting for real action because of how much opposition there is to it from the right and their oil lobbyists.
03/23/2021,stocks,"Yes that's very true, you're right.

But I guess if they produce and sell more of them then they gain more revenue which boosts their share price. But with this weird market who knows."
03/23/2021,stocks,You don't believe in the genome science? And palantir doesn't seem like much risk
03/23/2021,stocks,"we'll see depends on the stock

example if I have some retail stocks: if there's another major spike in covid, I could be down 30-40% of what I bought it for and best case scenario I'd break even by the end of the year"
03/23/2021,stocks,Ok then. I am sorry.
03/23/2021,stocks,Well lockdown restrictions are going to start being lifted in the coming weeks and months. I can't imagine the economic situation being worse than it has been the last few months as everything has been closed. However even if things go well it's not nearly enough to offset the worsening situation in mainland Europe so bleak prospects for recovery stocks in the short term I think.
03/23/2021,stocks,"My family members over there are already vaccinated and a few of them are half my age. Here in Canada, we are just doing 80 and over."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Well if I thought they had no future I would be out, but it's really anyone's guess."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Palantir has literally never made a single penny of profit and they have hundreds of millions of dollars in debt

CRSP is a great company but genomics is extremely unpredictable in the short term"
03/23/2021,stocks,Not my expertise but I know even the most optimistic experts are expecting this to be fruitful over the course of decades rather than years.
03/23/2021,stocks,"Mhm, I see. Thanks for your time and best of luck."

03/23/2021,stocks,Is today the day?!
03/23/2021,stocks,Any thoughts on GME earnings tonight? My feeling is that the excitement might drive up the price today only to drop tomorrow because I don't foresee earnings justifying a big jump. Maybe an announcement of Cohen as CEO to go along with it?
03/23/2021,stocks,what is the future for AMC? Buy now at 11 and change? or is it just gonna dump?

03/23/2021,stocks,"When you should sell stock to lock in gains? I invested in Takung Art. It's up about 100 percent since I bought it. Yeah, fuck yeah. But, I feel it's artificially inflated because of buzz more than the quality of the company. I don't have a shit ton of money and want to grab some profit before it tanks. Does this make sense? to sell when it's rising? I want to grab my principle investment so that, eventually, I'm only investing profit."

Right now I can secure a $300 less option premium profit since I can exercise the put to essentially sell my 100 shares for $14.

03/23/2021,stocks,"Yea right? I mean there's plenty of positive reasons for the stock to go up. Maybe it's just a sign of market uncertainty. I mean look at the S&P pullback. If you're hedging with cash, surely potstocks is your first sell"

03/23/2021,stocks,"Sell. The market is in flux, it’s not worth the risk at the moment. You can always buy back in if it sinks and you still think it’s a value.

Otherwise, sell to cover your investment, but I’d definitely do that secondary to just exiting your position"
03/23/2021,stocks,Depends on how risk averse you are. It's hard to lose money cashing out 100% gains. Doesn't have to be the entire position unless you only have one share
03/23/2021,stocks,"Ooc, what made you invest in it?  Also, was there a catalyst that caused its huge spike? I don’t see any news releases on Fidelity and don’t feel like digging into it lol"
03/23/2021,stocks,"Hopefully before you lose them. Maybe consider taking out your original investment and leaving the profit in there. Easier to hold when it is all profit. Less potential upside, but less downside too. Just a thought."
03/23/2021,stocks,"So...that would make GME the Starks, and Melvin & Co. the Lannisters....I am good with that.

There does seem to be quite a bit of GoT style fuckery going on behind the curtain. Fun to watch this play out."
03/23/2021,stocks,I really want it to do something because it's getting old as a meme. I just want it to be over.
03/23/2021,stocks,Why would it be the end? Most of retail can’t even trade after hours.
03/23/2021,stocks,Went up in smoke.
03/23/2021,stocks,I bought more APHA at 18.20. Wish I held out to 17.70 but I’m glad I took advantage of this dip.  Can’t imagine upcoming legislation and the merger won’t have a huge effect on the stock
03/23/2021,stocks,No. One trade is defined as a buy and sell of the same stock in a five day period.
03/23/2021,stocks,Pretty sure it will just be one day trade if you only put in one sell order.
03/23/2021,stocks,"Could just be a glitch in the reporting. The spike lasted less than a minute it looks like, which would make no sense."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Wow, what do INSANE AH jumps like that mean? And please don’t put just a fucking rocket or banana"
03/23/2021,stocks,Results positive.

03/23/2021,stocks,You've never seen a big spike from GME after hours before?
03/23/2021,stocks,Are earnings not out? I saw an article saying it narrowly missed its earnings...
03/23/2021,stocks,What is your background or credentials of you and the 5 other rrdditors if you don't mind me asking.
03/23/2021,stocks,This is only speculation but my guess would be that analysts have intentionally over-estimated GameStop’s earnings so there’s little chance of it beating expectations and creating hype. Wouldn’t put it past them.
03/23/2021,stocks,"You're better off selling the option back to the market, as it probably still has a bit of a time premium to it, and then if you still want to get rid of your shares, you can just sell them for market price. I think that would be more effective, but maybe someone can correct me if I'm wrong"
03/23/2021,stocks,"If you make money, do it."
03/23/2021,stocks,Did you buy the put or sell it?
03/23/2021,stocks,[deleted]
03/23/2021,stocks,"lol.

No one cares about actual earnings report. What people want to see if they make big moves for the future. Cohen's plan, maybe a hint of him becoming CEO in the near future."
03/23/2021,stocks,Green today red tomorrow?
03/23/2021,stocks,I like the company but current price seems too high to me. I'm gonna buy if it drops under 40
03/23/2021,stocks,"I might buy if it goes lower. I love that company. I want to see them do well. However, they do lose alot of money which is why I haven't invested in them yet."
03/23/2021,stocks,"You’re looking at GME from a typical/logical stock perspective, but GME defies logic. It makes no sense that it spiked again after being $40 for a month, it makes no sense that it’s held it’s $200 price range this long. There is solid DD supporting both outcomes. I think it is clearly manipulated, look at today, why would the price be dipping on earnings day when people have held on for this long? They aren’t selling before a supposed catalyst (I don’t think it will do much without a big announcement), so what gives? It is a possibility that shorts have hid their position and are fucked, it’s also possible that they are riding the price down and making money off of options.

Main point .... nobody knows what the fuck is going on with GME or what will happen next."
03/23/2021,stocks,After earnings IV/gamma become steady; options will be reasonably priced again and this thing will shoot up once again
03/23/2021,stocks,"This is not manipulated, just a slow descent due to lack of hype. Retail WSB fanatics aren't the only ones holding GME and earnings may be a deathblow to current bubble. Unless volume picks up, or the earnings report is way better than expected there is a chance GME drops hard after the report."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Yes, I believe the squeeze is still the goal, some are saying they're now shooting for $100k per share, though I don't know how much of that is just memes.

Some folks also arguing that Gamestop pivoting to e-commerce will make it a valuable company, but even best case scenario that'd be like what, $50 a share?"
03/23/2021,stocks,"Wow, he must be one hell of an expert if he doesn't believe in 100k!"
03/23/2021,stocks,Link?
03/23/2021,stocks,Low volume is good
03/23/2021,stocks,"Isn’t it Q4 2020 earnings? Why would it be good? 
The only thing I could see is the possibility that the new console sales were very high in Q4.
There is literally zero percent chance it will move the price higher, earnings are about fundamentals, meanwhile the stock price is propped up 9x higher than it should be by hype, pumping, and delusion of some massive fantasy short squeeze...
I would sell because this thing is going to be a slow decline everyday down to $40-60"
03/23/2021,stocks,"It’s also fun, definitely worth the $180-190 price of admission"
03/23/2021,stocks,"How would you sell though, you got access to AH?"
03/23/2021,stocks,It's because the call was disappointing. After the earnings it actually went up.
03/23/2021,stocks,No ones dumping 99% cant trade ah
03/23/2021,stocks,"If you like losing money, go for it"
03/23/2021,stocks,"> 99% of us cant trade ah

The people that can trade are cutting their losses or getting out while they're ahead."

03/23/2021,stocks,Imagine it’ll still make today volatile. A twofer!
03/23/2021,stocks,"And you know, stock scarcity."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Only thing I can think of is that consoles were/are sold out due to scalpers. Think that’s making a bunch of people assume that earnings will be very good this time around. I have no clue what I’m doing, so I can’t speak to that, but it’s the most “reasonable” reason for earnings being good that I’ve seen

Side note: am I crazy or was it not like 2 years ago where every other Reddit post was someone shitting on GameStop? Where did this “GameStop is a good, solid company that we all love” mentality come from in the GME cult?"
03/23/2021,stocks,so many of my friends ended up with a shit ton of BB with stupid option plays. ironically i chose to buy in but did only a tiny bit at first under 10. the.man the fomo hit and i bought higher. dumb.
03/23/2021,stocks,i’ll start to nibble in once it gets under 10 but yeah under 9 i’m feasting
03/23/2021,stocks,shit looks like BB took this as a challenge for a race to 9

03/23/2021,stocks,How does that work with options? Is the strike price adjusted somehow?
03/23/2021,stocks,It needs to invent 7G networks and even then the stock will probably only tick  up a dollar or two.
03/23/2021,stocks,i made about 250. i'm content with that but not going to buy in until I learn more. The skyrocket was because of new buzz about NFT's but I'm not sure how much substance there is behind the company
03/23/2021,stocks,i'm realizing i'm not very risk averse. this is like gambling. it's driving me crazy. i had $450 in profit earlier. it's on a steady decline so i sold with $230 and Im pissed.
03/23/2021,stocks,Everyone in right now did it because it’s a massive pump. It went up on news from other NFTs.
03/23/2021,stocks,Just buzz about NFT's. I knew they were generating interest and just by happenstance read about the stock. I don't know anything about the company. I'm new to investing and decided that i'm done trying to chase super high returns and am going to work toward a diverse portfolio instead. lol...

03/23/2021,stocks,I see what you did there!
03/23/2021,stocks,Exactly where I bought in... fingers crossed with ya
03/23/2021,stocks,"A buy and then a sell on the same day is one day trade, the 3 trade limit in five days  applies to people like me with less than $25,000 in my account. Yesterday I did not have any available, today I have one available, so one was 6 days ago so it fell off. Still think I read that if you buy twice and then sell all it does a day trade for each buy order, totaling two day trades at once. I think I will try it when I have more day trades available just to see for sure, not worth the risk of no day trades for 90 days. BTW, if you go into a day holding and then sell that and then buy again it is not a day trade. Also, not fair assuming that because I don't have $25000 in my account I am too stupid to day trade, but that's the government for ya."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Yeah, could be. Although this has happened a few times in recent weeks. I honestly can’t explain it."
03/23/2021,stocks,"My guess would be a large purchase of the stock during AH.

P.S. I’ve edited this reply as, in hindsight, I can see that I misunderstood the commenter and responded poorly because of this."

I've had a weird year with a lot of silver linings and benefitted from the bull market so I'm semi-retired so I'm solely working on my site as a hobby and doing venture investments but only bars and restaurants so far... Hoping to find a good tech investment in the near future. I'm only 29 so my credentials are limited lol but you can look through my posts on my website (fair value estimates & analysis posts) and see some calls I've made. I try to target value plays that also exhibit growth. Right now I'm actually becoming less bullish and starting to move into Cabana drawdown funds for a few weeks though so I've been kind of hesitant to post any bullish articles for a bit until I'm more confident the market won't drag any of my featured stocks down with it"

03/23/2021,stocks,"Speculation is all any of has to go on and nothing would surprise me. There is no real solid reason for any certainty when it comes to GME. If you think it is going up there is a lot of DD to back you up, but if you think it is dying there is plenty of DD to back that up too. Personally I believe there is some life left, but I also have the whole dead cat bounce thing in the back of my mind.

Just speculation though.."
03/23/2021,stocks,I feel like I've read this exact comment four times now. Do you keep posing it?
03/23/2021,stocks,that's big if true
03/23/2021,stocks,"Options account for *splits and reverse splits* without issue, when everyone's ownership of shares is multiplied or divided. It does not, however, account for the company generating new shares to sell in an offering. Your strike price will stay the same, your number of contracts and the shares they hold will be the same, but the stock price will decrease to keep the market cap the same as it was before. So subsequently the value of the contract will also decrease.

AMC has 450 million shares outstanding right now (will be 495 million in May), it was just over 100 million last September. They've used their stock to raise money and there's no sign of stopping. That's good for AMC but bad for investors."
03/23/2021,stocks,Sounds like most of those plays have been fueled by assumptions. Nice for a pump-n-dump 👍
03/23/2021,stocks,"A profit is a profit. It could just have easily gone up another 50%, but that's the risk you took. Best thing you can do is watch how the S&P performs tomorrow before making any trades, unless you'd like to try catch a falling knife. Sometimes it'll pay off"
03/23/2021,stocks,Lol.
03/23/2021,stocks,"Something I learned long ago is that if you hear hooves, think horses not zebras. AH has such low volume, and the way that these feeds get their data can make any anomaly look worse than it is, and it’s really not worth reading into it all that deeply."

So instead of questioning if I am a good person anymore, and saying okay, (while at the same time being zen, and not trying to be a cunt) I will not allow fucks like you to affect my psych anymore. I am working on softening my vocabulary everyday, but there was nothing wrong with that message you beta. 

Thankfully I’m not as effected by other people’s words as you are

This is a serious thing, I’ve thought about suicide on the matter multiple times. Imagine how many veterans are told they’re cunts when they are just going through a transition( Believe me, it’s real), and all they need is 1/ every 1000th person to not heed to societies parameters of ‘politically acceptable sentence structure and emphasis’ %100 of the time. 

Yeah yeah I know, freedom of speech and you can think for yourself, I’m just bringing this issue to light for all you civilians to see, maybe vets to jump on board and put in they’re opinion, and to maybe change it a little.

The one where where everything was out of stock?"
03/23/2021,stocks,"So, what they’re talking about selling a contract to close. That means you’re just passing your contract on. Meaning you get the profit from what you paid.

Selling to open is what you’re thinking of when it comes to obligations, that area is completely different and I would not recommend getting into it unless you’re selling covered calls/puts"
03/23/2021,stocks,"I would do the 10 minutes necessary to better understand options trading. Calls made sense to me, but I never spent the 5 minutes to understand Puts until right now. Just google ""Puts"" and google the first post from investopedia (or just click this link https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/put.asp)

I'm assuming you didn't write a put, and instead bought a Put option contract. As someone who bought a put contract (you), you (the owner) ""have the right, but not the obligation, to sell a certain amount of the underlying asset, at a set price within a specific time"".

You should be able to just sell the contract if you are in the money without any worries. But please stop doing further options trading until you do more research and have a firm grasp on them."

Right now, I’m going in dozens of directions from looking into MIT’s free YouTube courses on finance, portfolio management, controlled risk, etc (though I’m thinking I will need to take some prerequisite in math).
The rest of my research is just googling any time I don’t understand something (which is everything), like why market cap is important, what float % is and what it’s used for when doing DD, what to look for in a company to see if it is good to buy stock in, should I learn swing trading 100% or devout some time to learn day trading, how options work and the different strategies, what types of tools should I be using and what are the best tools, how bonds trading works, etc, etc, etc.

So I guess my question is, what is best to focus on when learning as a brand new trader or should I just kind of keep going down this route until I get a better, general idea and may figure what direction I want to go as I go.

Thanks in advance!"
03/23/2021,stocks,"Here’s a quick cursory overview of the basics to intermediate: 

Most important thing to learn from the start is that the foundation of Investing is not profits, it’s Risk Management. 

You need to learn to be able to keep it, before you can grow it. 

Also, assess your investment objectives (are you seeking safety, income, growth) or secondary objectives like (tax minimization or liquidity)?

Then pick your investment style: Value, Growth, combination of value and growth known as (GARP - Growth at a reasonable price), income or Momentum investing. 

Are you interested being a Passive investor (replicating the performance of an index) or Active investor (trying to outperform the market). 

Also understand different types of investments strategies: Dollar cost averaging, Dividends reinvestment plans, scaling in and scaling out, pyramiding etc.

With regards to psychology: learn about what’s known as “second-order thinking” and build a habit of thinking in probabilities. 

Remember 2 things: that inactivity in a stocks price is not a negative factor and the market rewards patience. 

Macro-economic factors: Ask yourself how the Political, Economical, and Social factors you learn and see will affect the Market, the economy, and more importantly, your investments. 

Learn about DCF models, they are excel models that calculate the intrinsic value of a stock in order to quickly asses wether they are overvalued, undervalued or fair valued by calculating the present value of a share price today relative to the amount of returns that it can potentially generate in the future. 

Fundamental and Technical analysis are not mutually exclusive as most think, you can apply them in unison to be a more effective investor or trader by using fundamentals to value stocks and using technical analysis to assess your entry and exit (buying and selling points). 

Learn about financial ratios to asses the overall financial health of the company (ex. Working Capital, Debt to equity, Gross profit margin, net profit margin, dividend yield, inventory turnover, EPS, P/E ratio. Etc.) - more useful for comparing companies position in the overall industry or sector. 

Diversification (Not putting all your eggs in one basket) by diversifying into different asset classes (stocks, bonds, mutual funds, ETF’s) or into different sectors and industries etc. and learn about negative asset correlation. 

Lastly, learn the inter-related relationship of how interest rates, inflation, stocks, bond-prices, currencies and commodities interact with each other and influence the overall state of the market, the economy and your investments. 

Depending on how much hours you generally put in a day on learning and research.. 

understanding and mastering each of these areas in more depth and applying these concepts above should save you days if not weeks or even months of research and education. But never stop learning and you’ll become an even better investor/trader with experience. 

Hope this helps! :)

03/23/2021,stocks,"> “Day traders do not make good long-term investors and vice-versa”.  

Definitely not true. On what basis is that derived from? 

I have both long-term and short Investments and also day-trade and swing trade equities, FX (currencies), options and commodities and have had pretty good success with both. 

I’m a Finance Major and also work as an equities analyst and even though I make pretty decent compensation plus performance bonuses, there are days and months when I make much more on my investments and trades then from my full-time job."
03/23/2021,stocks,"My recommendation would be to invest in fractional stocks until you've gotten the technique down pat. Less risk, greater rewards later. And really, there's no rush to learning the curve unless you feel there should be.

On particularly volatile days, sometimes it serves best to just walk away from your computer, phone, or whatever device you're using, and take a walk. Trust the you that made the sound, cool-headed decisions, not the you that's silently screaming about losses and FUD in extremis lol. Truth be told, that second guy's kind of a reactionary asshole. 🤣"
03/23/2021,stocks,"I based that on seeing how long term investors tried to day trade, and they don’t like buying stocks that are trading up if the fundamentals of the company are not good. And a friend owns a day trade shop and all the people he has hired that had a long term background fizzled out.  I am not saying all, and if I did it was a mistake, but maybe it is my age group, but the successful day traders I know, don’t care what they own .  Glad you are successful at multiple disciplines"
03/23/2021,stocks,"That’s mostly because long-term investing and trading require two completely different mindsets and disciplines. 

Generally speaking, most investors also don’t apply a top down approach to investing (Macro-economic analysis) and only apply company analysis. 

Trading requires you to have an in-depth understanding of the economy and charting analysis, price action etc. not just company operations and analyzing competitive advantages in an industry. 

Although it doesn’t necessarily mean you can’t be good at one just because you’re good at the other.  

It just means that these are two different fields where one must be mastered before moving on to the basics of the other and then learning to master that one. 

You can’t expect to be good at investing and then switch to trading and be a master at that as well. With regard to mentality, discipline and strategies, they are almost two completely different fields."

2021-03-23 12:45:29,stocks,"$CODX shining this week!! $CODX is an undervalued covid play with earnings coming up on Thursday! WSJ has a price target of $30-$40 which is 2-3xs higher than closing price. It was the best quarter ever thanks to its patented covid tests. They also just announced a partnership with Walgreens for their latest patented product, a covid saliva test. Closed yesterday at $14 (a 5% gain), and is up over 35% in the last two weeks. 

Also calls are still dirt cheap, the $15 call closed at $.75! 

I confessed my love for $CODX about two weeks ago and got chewed out by a ton of people! But I hope it’s proven itself to those who hated on the post with its 35%+ gains since then 👍

Ps. I’m holding shares and calls: 
3/16 calls: $15, $15.5, $19
4/16 calls: $23, $30

I’m no financial expert so do what you may with this info :)"
03/23/2021,stocks,"I too own and like the stock.  I have owned the stock and watched the stock since the first days of the Pandemic and it's been an entertaining ride.  

However, before you throw too much into expiring call options, I encourage you to look at the price movement of the stock after the last 3-4 earnings reports.

I'll give you an early taste. The stock tanked...every....single...time.  The stock then recovers, does a little dance, and of course tanks again.  

It's because the company has had a hard time turning a great product, and a huge testing need into sales growth.  

I think every quarter the market predicts an earning surprise leading up to earnings, much of what you are seeing now, because of the overwhelming need for testing.  But instead codx has delivered a earning miss more or less every quarter.  

The expectations finally might be more realistic this time, and they might still have an earning surprise waiting for us, but recent history is hard to ignore. 

Again, I like the tech, I like the fundamentals of the company, and I like potential going forward, however I would not invest more into call options than I do into the actual stock as the only options that have paid at earning recently are puts.   

Good luck."

2021-03-23 12:25:34,stocks,"How does manipulating penny stocks work? As you can tell from my question, I’m very uneducated on stocks. However, a close friend is getting involved with a guy. He says he has made millions from penny stocks. He has a group of people who buy a large portion of stocks of a company, over 50% im pretty sure he said. Then I believe my friend told me that he said that the team he has holds them and then sells at one point and makes a lot of money somehow. Does this make any sense to anyone? It sounds sketchy to me and I want my friend to be careful before getting involved. So I thought I would ask you guy."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Your friend is breaking the law. It’s called a “pump and dump”, basically a pyramid scheme kinda but with stocks. It’s a form of securities fraud.

If you’re tempted to get involved for easy money then don’t. Only one or two people at the very top of this pyramid actually make money. They make money by convincing idiots that they can rip other people off down the chain but really it’s those fools after easy money who are in fact the mark.

Your friend isn’t your friend. Your friend is trying to steal your money by appealing to your greed."
03/23/2021,stocks,"This is called a ""pump and dump"" and ultimately, unless your the one holding the large portion of the stocks, you will get screwed by this. Manipulators drive up the share price of a cheap penny stock with low volume (the amount of people who buy and sell every day). Then, because they bought so much of a stock that not many people buy, basic supply and demand causes it to appear as if the stock price is spiking. This convinces more people to buy the stock since it looks like its going up. Once more people buy, the stock price goes up more. Then, the person with the large portion sells their portion, screwining everyone else to take their profit."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Since nobody has used the term yet:

It’s called front loading.

Load up a subpenny stock at 0.0001 and then the army of 50 to 100 loaders go to Twitter, Reddit and mostly investorshub (a notorious subpenny stock board) and launch a pumping campaign and make other suckers buy it

There is a draw with subpenny stocks. Really misguided and desperate folks jump in just like the lottery - for 100 bucks you can buy 1 million shares of a totally worthless company (but the hype and posts of the front loaders convince people to buy this lottery ticket)

And with more people buying, the stock moves from 0.0001 to 0.0004, and the front loaders exit the trade and it returns to 0.0001 in a couple of days and enters no bid for months and years 

You literally lost your money and can’t even sell it.

I studied this in great detail with a 500$ investment to understand OTC markets and pink sheets

Many people fall for the penny stock scam. It’s sad. 

I wish I can write a thread and sticky it for noobs. It’s always noobs who get slaughtered in subpenny stocks 

And your friend is probably making millions in an unethical way. This is straight up wolf of Wall Street shit. Pump and dump on innocent people

This is the kind of people who are desperate and buy penny stocks. These are real cases in my investigation in investorshub:

1. A dental assistant who was a single mom. She lost 2k (I studied this person and why she decided to gamble on penny stocks)
2. Students 
3. Very old people who think stock can go from 0.0001 to 0.05 and they can make millions. Gamble their retirements away 
4. People making under 75K and strapped for cash

People argue even 5$ stocks are penny stocks. It’s impossible to buy more than 50% of a 4$ stock. But it is very very possible in the subpenny world. If you have 50K in cash, you can actually buy 50% of a company. So I am very certain this Friend of yours is trading the subpenny stocks and there are many such front loaders - just go to Twitter - they are out there in the public eye"
03/23/2021,stocks,Don’t do it. It’s unethical and illegal
03/23/2021,stocks,Sounds like market manipulation
03/23/2021,stocks,Sounds like market manipulation to me and it's a good way to end up in jail when they eventually get caught.
03/23/2021,stocks,I think its just basic supply and demand that drives up the price but its illegal so i wouldnt do it

03/23/2021,stocks,"I’m not a lawyer either but my understanding is making statements you know to be false or misleading in order to force a price move for your own profit is illegal.

It’s kind of moot since they don’t get caught though, especially since they do it mostly on Reddit and Twitter, etc, now so you can’t catch them. The reason not to get involved is, well it’s immoral lol, but also it doesn’t work unless you’re right at the top of the chain. 

They work in teams structured very similar to multilevel marketing. The boss tells his guys time to sell, they then sell before telling their guys who then sell before telling their guys... by the time you find out it’s time to sell it’s already tanked and you discover that you were in fact the designated bag holder all along."

03/23/2021,stocks,"Well yeah I get that but OP never stated that his friend was making any kind of statements to force a price move. 

Also, working as a team isn’t illegal is it? Isn’t that what hedge funds essentially do? Given its penny stocks, they’re so cheap and volume probably isn’t so high that if you get a big enough group with enough money you can determine the direction of the stock."

03/23/2021,stocks,"Inflation doesn’t occur simultaneously and instantly. For example, every year, let’s say inflation is 2%. Apple is not raising its iPhone price 2% every year. Sometimes they raise by more, sometimes not at all. People expect the 2% inflation raise yearly. If all the sudden were on pace for 4%, but Apple has already released their phones and isn’t going to randomly raise prices mid cycle, they are now making 2% less than expected (4% actual minus 2% expected). 

In a nutshell, inflation causes the value of money to go down right? so when inflation occurs, if a company is bringing in the same nominal dollar amount but inflation is rising (and outpacing expectations that have been accounted for) the “real” or “true” revenue is less than expected. 

Inflation lowers future real earnings. 

To counter this, the fed raises interests rates, but doing so means it costs more money for companies to borrow money. For a tech company that may not be as profitable now but expects to be in the future so they rely on loans (think Uber, Doordash, lots of EV companies and SPACs), rising interests rates means needing to make more money to pay off debt. 

So inflation bad but so is the solution to inflation. 

To take advantage, a lot of people are rotating into value stocks (tech stocks are hit the hardest by inflation/raising interest rate) since these companies rely less on loans. Further consumer staples and retailers like Walmart etc continue to do well since interest rates rising isn’t that bad for them + inflation isn’t as much as a factor since they sell goods (like bread, eggs) that can fluctuate with the economy.

Personally, I think tech stocks will see a nice little run now that the fed has committed to not raising rates till 2023 and we’ve already had our big scare. 

hope that helps somewhat"
03/23/2021,stocks,"You are correct that Inflation by itself would cause stocks to go up (some more than others, some would decline, on aggregate though, they’d go up). 

I think the fear is the Fed would raise interest rates more quickly which would cause stocks to go down. They’ve said they’re willing to let inflation run hot but any jump spooks the markets right now. They’ve also said they won’t touch interest rates for another two years or whatever it is but I don’t think anyone (especially the market) really believes them."
03/23/2021,stocks,In a real economy a little inflation is a healthy sign of a good economy.   We had many years of quantitative easing from Janet yellen. Thus keeping rates low for a long time. It kept people buying cars and affording houses. Too much of the low interest rates is also bad because now home prices are much too high. And people got used to the free money with low interest rates. Interest rates need to come up to a normal level they have just been suppressed for years. It’s a good sign but can shake up the markets till they stabilize.
03/23/2021,stocks,"It’s not inflation it’s the rise of 10 year treasuries and interest rates..

Asset pricing is based on risk free return (10yr treasury usually). As that rises it suppresses prices.

Inflation goes up, higher rates which means lower growth models for asset prices"
03/23/2021,stocks,"If you take the simplified model of a value of company being equal to future cash flows then higher inflation means the discounted sum of future cash flows is worth less in todays money.

Obviously stocks have a lot more going for them but for bonds the calculus is simple if you want to get a feel for it."
03/23/2021,stocks,A run on the banks for one
03/23/2021,stocks,"Well the easiest answer to this question is to just go look at what happened last time America had high inflation - the late 1960's, 1970's and early 1980's. In 1965 inflation was 1.59%, by 1970 it was 5.84%. It then went down a bit to 3.27% in 1972, before sky rocketing up to 11%, dropping down to a still very high 5.74% and then sky rocketed up again to 13.55% in 1980. 

From 1980 inflation came back down and has stayed relatively low then. Look at the graph for yourself and you can download the data to check my compounded calculations. Between 1965 and 1983 there was a 311.12% total increase of inflation (rates compounded each year). Over the last 18 years for comparison the total increase of inflation has been a meagre 44.38%. 

Inflation from 1960's onwards:

[https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/USA/united-states/inflation-rate-cpi](https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/USA/united-states/inflation-rate-cpi)

So what happened to the SP500 from 1965 to 1983? Well it spent 17 years going down about 62%. It bottomed out in 1982 and then went up a massive bull-run from 1983 onwards. It still wasn't above its 1965 high water market until the early 1990's though. 

There's a lot of moving parts to this and the translation from high inflation = shit stocks has lots of variables and other factors which are directly and indirectly related. High interest rates being a consequence of high inflation being a major drag on stocks. But if we expect high inflation, the stock market is not the place to be. 

Now if there was *hyperinflation* which some doomsayers think... then yes the stock market would go up exponentially just as inflation would. You can look at Venezuela's index and what not and see that it goes up 100's of % as the money becomes worthless. But that's a completely different story to just high inflation."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Very detailed explanation. Thank you!  

So now assuming the reopening of the economy isn't a gradual process, we should be due for a spike in inflation. Does this mean tech stocks may see another correction then? Since that translates to lower future earnings for tech stocks."
03/23/2021,stocks,But as long as they keep printing the looming threat of inflation is there.
03/23/2021,stocks,"This is a great explanation. That said, I disagree in part with higher interest rates being bad per se (“inflation bad but so is the solution.”)

Low interest rates drive business growth, yes. However, low interest rates also put a strain on retirement systems and savers and force them to be more speculative via the stock market. 

I would argue that an important, albeit lesser, factor is that higher interest rates provide a lower risk investment option for retirees, retirement systems, and savers that directly competes with the stock market."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Thanks! So if I understand you correctly, the sell off was due to investors piling on bonds to take advantage of higher rates?"
03/23/2021,stocks,"Potentially. What's tough is now some fear is priced into the stocks. A correction has occurred, the Nasdaq dropped 10%. Tech stocks got killed. In theory, that sell off/correction was because people were beginning to price in lower future earnings due to inflation. There were also other factors though, such as the fact in the prior months, the Nasdaq saw insane growth. 

The Fed remains adamant that long term inflation won't be an issue. People clearly don't believe that as inflation fears remain high. 

If it was easy to time this stuff we'd all be brilliant and rich as hell. Personally, I think tech is the future and that as COVID comes to an end, so will federal spending and inflation and we will return to normal levels of inflation. It may be a volatile year in the market, but I like the saying ""time in the market beats timing the market."" The correction was a nice buying opportunity to get some stocks at lower prices, now I just play the waiting game."
03/23/2021,stocks,Correct and I think the printing needs to stop sooner rather than later
03/23/2021,stocks,"Good for society isn't always the same as good for the market. Yes in a lot of ways higher rates are actually good for the average person, but as you said, low rates forced people into stocks and high rates give a safe alternative. Money flowing out of stocks is had for stocks."
03/23/2021,stocks,"agree with u/waterwoo 

what’s good for society/the economy isn’t necessarily good for stocks and the other way around too. But you make valid points"
03/23/2021,stocks,"Could be, this is where I’m on shakier ground. Financial theory says is this is what they should do. It could also be buyers of equities demanded a lower price."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Yes that is in theory partially true. The fed needs bonds to be enticing so someone is willing to buy a bond over a stock. When the fed sells a bond for less, the yield rises since for less money, you get a better payout. The more yields rise and the more stocks sink, the more enticing bonds become and it repeats a cycle"
03/23/2021,stocks,"The sell off is institutions, they hold the majority of stock."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Thanks! I'm very bullish on tech too. I was more interested in another major dip to buy into and less in timing the market. 

I've been dumping all my income into stocks this past year thinking cash isn't worth holding right now. I missed out on the last dip because I had no cash. Although it's worked out well enough for me so far"

I guess I was thinking more holistically. As a tax payer, I worry about \[super\] low interest rates because it really just takes money from one hand and puts it in the other. As a tax payer, I'll ultimately be on the hook for larger social program payments for retirees because traditional savings is no longer effective, basically breaking that part of the retirement system. What's left are social programs and the stock market, and the latter is relatively high risk compared to an interest-bearing FDIC insurance account.

Anyway, just rambling now...  not really relevant to this sub."
03/23/2021,stocks,Interesting. This is the first time I've looked at the economics behind stock movement

03/23/2021,stocks,Why do intermediate to long term bond ETFs lose value whenever the ten year benchmark rises?
03/23/2021,stocks,I agrée with you I think the fed is downplaying all their money printing too much but guess we’ll see
03/23/2021,stocks,Yup. Lots of printing.
03/23/2021,stocks,"This is what drives a lot, especially right now. Keep in mind a lot of it is expectations - it isn’t necessarily a bunch of money managers got together and sold things if inflation rose, it’s more that buyers are demanding a different price. Regardless you get the same outcome.

Knowing these trends can help you make good investments. For example, if last fall you knew we were on a path to open up and there was no way the fed could keep 10 year rates at zero you could have easily predicted a rate rise. Banks do well in that environment because they have a larger spread. A lot of people loaded up on bank stocks and did well. This stuff is hard though, see rule #9

03/23/2021,stocks,If anything inflation will be too low because the majority of people have been pushed into debt and the portion of funds going to consumers will just go towards paying off those incurred debts. There isn't enough consumer capital to cause much inflationary increases in costs since it would simply crush the limited demand due to more people only being able to spend on essentials.

Really? That doesn't help AT ALL 😂

What's even funnier is that the article came out right before the match crash.

I actually bought a decent amount of bank stocks last summer thinking there's no way they can stay low. I'm glad I bought and stayed in this long"
03/23/2021,stocks,"Yeah, that one cracks me up, reminds me of this unexpected dollar spike we’re having right now. That wasn’t supposed to happen (and burned/is burning a lot of hedge funds).

Nice work on the banks."

03/23/2021,stocks,"Warren Buffet (and others) think that long term, no one beats the S&P 500. (theres a famous bet he made. google it forshits and giggles). 

Also , there are plenty of studies that prove again and again that active traders rarely - if ever - beat the average S&P return / year.   
it might not be exciting, and you probably will never have surges. you never have returns per stock of 50-100%.   
but, you also will probably have less losses, won´t sit on losers for years and -statistically speaking - are guaranteed to come out on top. 

A diversified ETF portfolio - in my personal opinion - might be the smartest investment choice and strategy one can take. 

I personally have the majority of my funds in etf´s. the rest is either dividend stocks, a few indivial titles I firmly believe in to be long term holds. and a teeny tiny fraction for ""fun"" to keep it exciting. 

but I have to admit: everytime I look at my ""long term holders"" and my ""fun"" stocks, I wish I had that money in my ETF or my dividend stocks, because those are my only losers as of yet. 

have fun and be smart with your money."

03/23/2021,stocks,ETFs are good to participate in a bubble market as it reduces risk of your portfolio going to zero!
03/23/2021,stocks,"The downside from my perspective is that it is less interesting than investing in stocks. It is more fun to get to know the fundamental business model of what you invest in than just let it run.
So for those that do nit want to be involved I like ETF only portfolios but for those who want to be involved I believe adding stocks spices up the thing and that will help over time"
03/23/2021,stocks,"If you don't have much interest and want to avoid risks, yes. 
But if you are interested you can easily put like 30% of your money into specific stocks, just don't put more than 5% of your total portfolio into a single stock in that 30%.

Goodluck buddy!"
03/23/2021,stocks,"80% of people will make more money buying and holding a broad based index fund, than picking and choosing individual stocks (or more narrowly focused ETFs). In the short term. And long term its probably closer to 99%. Because we all doubled or tripled our money last year with stonks and options, but you probably haven't actually cashed much out, or invested in areas outside the stock market, and will lose most of it in the next 2-3 years when stocks aren't in vogue anymore and are outclassed by other investments. But people DCAing into index funds will still be making steady gains and dividends the whole time + buying the dip to make money when the next stock market bubble happens in 10-20 years."
03/23/2021,stocks,"I have 2 accounts. One for ETFs and one for stocks for fun.
Right now, my stocks are all over the place, just like everyone else. My ETFs stay steady and I have from 50-100% gains over the last year. I keep those as my long term holds and so far they are doing very right by me. So I guess you can say that I am a fan of ETFs."
03/23/2021,stocks,"All depends on your risk tolerance and the time you have to gather DD. ETF’s are low risk depending on the sector and economic environment and individual stocks tend to have higher risk with higher reward, with options trading even higher risk higher reward than individual stocks. Optimal portfolio is an opinion based statement, my optimum portfolio may look different than yours based on age, money able to invest, risk tolerance and experience in the market. It’s something you need to figure out for yourself everyone is different. Hope that helps."
03/23/2021,stocks,I guess it depends on your risk to reward ratio. ETFs can be good but they also tend to focus on specific industries so if there are issues they can tank fairly hard. But so can anything else.
03/23/2021,stocks,The younger you are the more valuable an ETF is. At the end of the day it all depends on your risk tolerance.
03/23/2021,stocks,"I went from a diversified portfolio with 6-7 etf to basically a few stocks to one stock only :Tesla 

Warren Buffet even told us he only got 2 or 3 stocks before he got famous or something like that ... so yeah , with stocks there is much more profitpotential , but only do this to very few stocks which you really like and prefer , be very picky about it !
That way you always stay up to date with the companies and don’t panic sell if the market tanks , I took -30% going only Tesla but I really believe in them and currently they are going strong again
The younger you are the more risk you can take because the wealth you get from paychecks is still ahead and you don’t think about money preservation"

03/23/2021,stocks,"I find the downside of ""it's less interesting"" as an upside, actually. Then again, investing isn't something I want to be a hobby or to be fun. It's actually a very serious thing for me, because I have serious goals for myself and my family financially, and keep a simple investing portfolio is all I need. I don't care for missing out on the TSLA's and ZM's. Hell, I could average 7% yearly for the next 15 years and I'll hit my goals, though I expect more. I speak only for myself, and I don't anybody in contempt if you want the stock market to be a fun hobby for you. But for me, the less I can think about my portfolio, the better."
03/23/2021,stocks,Why would ETFs not be as valuable for older people? Do you want them to invest in individual stocks instead? That would be riskier.

03/23/2021,stocks,"After 30 stocks, there are no additional benefits to diversifying, but there's something with having 3 stocks too. I can't quite remember what it was. Something like that's the largest increase of safety for minimum amount of effort or something like that."

03/23/2021,stocks,"It’s not that they are less valuable, it’s just that you simply have less time to reap the rewards. If I invest in an ETF at 20, I’ll see 50+ years of gains relative to its target.

03/23/2021,stocks,Yes I am still young and dumb so who cares about diversification for now :D
03/23/2021,stocks,"Seems true since you focus on only 3 companies and basically should know how they compete in the market , things won’t fly over your head with 3 stocks in mind.

03/23/2021,stocks,Indeed there is a good graphic on the Trading 212 app when you look at the auto-invest feature that shows you how much your investment will grow over x years in the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF. If I put in £100 a month over the next 23 years I will come out the other side with £1m.
03/23/2021,stocks,"That sounds a bit too high to me. I used this calculator:

03/23/2021,stocks,Sorry yes I also added in a lump sum that I’ve already got in so probably why. T212 suggests 14% on average which is also maybe why it’s a little higher than anticipated.

In this fictional portfolio you are long the best stocks of the last year and short the worst stocks of the last year. This portfolio does (on a risk adjusted basis) outperform the market. It is a part of Fama/French 5-factor model and is called Winner-Minus-Loser (WML). So I think it depends on the specific situation of the company.

2021-03-23 08:10:10,stocks,"Has Anybody Purchased Pre-IPO Shares from EquityZen or SharesPost? If so, I would love to hear your opinion about the process. 

A company that I would like to support will be selling shares soon, but I am not entirely clear about the reliability of these platforms. Therefore, any insights would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks!"
03/23/2021,stocks,"I would argue that these are NOT ideal investment for most retail investors. Aside from being an accredited investor (minimum networth/income criteria), there are several practical challenges. 

1. you must pay an inflated premium on valuation from most recent funding. this would also include additional fee from these websites.

2. You dont own the shares directly and cant really see how they are appreciating/depreciating. 

3. Liquidating your shares will be extremely difficult if not impossible. These websites will not buyback the stock from you but try to find another buyer. (Timeshare model anyone?)

4. You dont know when and if the company will ever be public. You lose all of your money if company folds.

5. You dont have any control/visibility on dilution if company decides to raise cash from investors or offer equity to new employee. 

In short, this is NOT for everybody. I would say get into this only if you can invest in multiple pre-ipo companies so that you can make money even if one of them shoots up. But if you can afford to do all that, try being an angel investor and invest in early stage companies where you can get better bang for the buck."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Well first you need to have a certain net worth so I'll assume that is checked, yes these are reliable and not scams however this is not robinhood or something else these shares aren't the most liquid and also the company may have an investment minimum, also you really need to know your stuff these companies don't run on hype this is a fundamentals game so think carefully before investing. The reason this seems like lots of regulation is because there really is no hand holding and it can get complicated and make sure the company your investing in is trustworthy, they are not required to release quarterly report or anything so your kind of going in blind unless you have some insider knowledge about the firm."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Things in private equity/venture capital do not work the same way as public markets. There is no standard of reporting and “accredited investor” is a proxy for financial literacy. Projections can be extremely rosy and the assumption is you have the ability to dig into things enough to test their projections and push back. 

You’re going to need to understand exactly what you’re buying. Are you buying into a fund (partnership) that owns the company stock? If so, what are the costs, incentives and rights the GP have (could they keep the partnership open even if the stock goes public so you never actually get the shares)? If you’re getting shares directly, where do you sit in the cap structure? Employees are typically granted common stock but each VC round is typically a class of preferred equity that has a liquidation preference above each previous round and all are above the common. If things go well, all the preferred gets converted to common so you need to understand how the dilution works. If things don’t go well or even just ok. The VC firms could potentially sell the company for a value that leaves little to no value for the common equity. 

How do these platforms make their money? Is it a fee to broker the transaction or are they also making a spread (they bought the shares from the employees at $10 and you’re buying from them at $15)?

What information rights do you have? Will you get a financial statement or just a capital account statement (basically just one line of here’s how much money you gave us and here’s its value today with no additional info or context)? Who is providing that statement? How are they arriving at the valuation of what you bought?"
03/23/2021,stocks,"I’ve gotten close to taking some deals on the platform. 


The problem is that they charge a hefty fee (usually 5%), and the valuation you are offered shares at tends to be very bloated compared to a recent fundraising round. 

I think it’s a fine investment if you really truly believe in the company for the long term, but you certainly aren’t getting any bargains and are taking on tremendous risk.

With the fees and high valuation, you basically need the company to be a true winner long term and end up with it being a blockbuster IPO."
03/23/2021,stocks,"They have a couple ways of acquiring shares, and they offer different valuations. 
For example, they gather interest from their users and try to get an alottment of shares (sorry, I can't think of the actual terminology because it's been a long day). This way has a slightly higher (or lower) valuation based on demand.
They also have some sort of ""instant"" invest option where you can purchase somebody's shares (like an employee looking to sell their stock options, or perhaps other Equityzen users trying to cash out their positions). In those cases, the valuation is usually pretty high. I recently saw they had shares of Impossible available through option B at like $8B valuation, and the last time they had it available through option A, it was closer to like $2B valuation.
I have used Equityzen a couple times, I think 10k is the minimum for first time, but after that it goes up to 20 or 25k for each additional buy in. 
None of the companies I have bought into have gone public yet."

03/23/2021,stocks,"Yeah 100% agree. Personally for me I think there are enough publicly listed small companies to invest in which give similar risk/returns ratios, and have the plus side of being liquid ie you can see how you’re investment is doing every day and sell it when you want.

Obviously you could buy a future Uber/AirBnB pre-IPO and do amazingly well 5 years down the line, but tbh you’re much more likely to buy one of the majority of startups that goes nowhere and at best get all your capital back after a few years when they’re acquired (assuming they don’t crash and burn)"

03/23/2021,stocks,"Thank you for the feedback.  I appreciate your guidance.  You are correct that only ""accredited investors"" are eligible, and I will provide what (limited) additional knowledge I have, for those who may be interested.  Please feel free to correct any inadvertent misstatements.

My understanding, is that the investment minimum is $10k, and you don't actually get the shares up front.  Instead, your money goes into a fund, which EquityZen uses to buy the shares from an employee of the private company.  Whenever, the company IPOs (or gets acquired), EquityZen's fund can be liquidated, and your proceeds (shares or cash) can finally arrive in your account of preference.

Ultimately, I think my concern hinges on the mechanics of the holding period and distribution process associated with EquityZen's fund.  I've never had my money in a vehicle like that before, so I am a bit apprehensive of an unfamiliar process.

EDIT:  FYI, I just read that the lockup period for EquityZen shares is 180 days after IPO.  I believe that is pretty standard...probably any SEC regulation."
03/23/2021,stocks,Awesome analysis!  Thank you.
03/23/2021,stocks,"I agree.  I remember one time they had access to one company that I really wanted to invest in, but the valuation was so untethered from reality that I simply couldn't justify the math.  This new one, however, has a valuation coming in significantly under the most recent funding round (which was a year ago...presumably value has increased further since then), so the value proposition is far more appealing than prior opportunities that I've seen on the site.  Like anything else, there are probably occasional diamonds in the rough, if you are persistent and fortunate enough to stumble upon them.  Or, somebody knows something that I don't, and I could be the poor sap who inherits a time-bomb.  Haha.  I guess there's no way to be 100% certain with this type of situation.  Therein lies the conundrum."

How long have you been holding your EquityZen positions?  Have there been any hiccups along the way, or has it been relatively smooth sailing thus far?"
03/23/2021,stocks,"You got it, which is why the shares are very non liquid or, selling is not as easy as just clicking a sell button, and tbh I think the restrictions are there for a reason these are complex investments and require quite a bit of knowledge and training while the stock market is quite simple, basically many make the mistake that this is like a private shares stock market and this is very far from the truth. This is why private equity and VC firms exist. My recommendation is that you learn alot about how to value a private company and the mechanics of the private market because it's absolutely not the same as the stock market, but I don't want to discourage you, on the contrary I hope you find this stuff as interesting as me lol, just out of curiosity what is the company you are looking at?"

Their current fair value is $415 and the sit at $350 they pay some of the highest dividends on the market as well at 3%. Not to mention Biden will keep dropping bombs and the company is essentially the research and development arm of our military and the very definition of too big to fail (74% of business is US) not only due to their size but because of the extremely sensitive national security secrets they possess (if aliens are real these are the people reverse engineering their craft). They build the F35 which will bring in 406 billion dollars in sales as well as 1.1 TRILLION dollars in operations and Maintennace. They have embedded options in space which is another trillion dollar market. Oh and they are merging with Aerojet Rocketdyne one of the biggest missile manufacturers. They will make the bombs as well as the planes that drop them. The have not recovered their pre COVID price because they are so fucking big and expensive and had nothing to do with pandemic. Q4 2020 saw record shattering sales across all 4 business sectors (aeronautics +11%, rotary and mission systems +9%, missiles and fire control +11%, space +9%. They shave also substantially reduced debt as well as shares outstanding. Did I mention a 147 billion dollar backlog (up 3B from last year)?

TLDR: this is the very definition of a value play. Buy and hold as much as reasonably possible below $350 ideally, but anywhere below $400 will do. Hold. Hold. Hold. Until the US decides to go a year without increasing the defense budget, the country goes bankrupt, or world peace suddenly breaks out. I'd take this over a savings accnt anyday.

They are currently working on hypersonic planes, quantum computing, AI, and they are building rockets and satellites for the US military, NASA, and Blue Origin. I am extremely bullish on Space and this company is deep in it. Overall extremely bullish on the company."

If a company that has price below its Price to Book ratio go bankrupt and get delisted, do I get money as a shareholder?

Assets are worth more than the price of the stock and during liquidation the assets are being redistributed to people who lent money to that stock primarily but debt is already included in P/B ratio. Thus, technically speaking, if you hold a company that goes bankrupt and has below 1 P/B ratio, you should earn money. Do I understand it correctly? What are the downsides of this?

Edit: sorry for bad English, it’s not my first language"
03/23/2021,stocks,"If you are a shareholder for a company that declares bankruptcy, assume you get nothing."
03/23/2021,stocks,Bankruptcy court decides. Bondholders and preferred shareholders come first.
03/23/2021,stocks,"I literally thought from the title that you were wanting to talk about the act of somehow driving small cap companies into bankruptcy :D

Basically, assume you get nothing. You’d be the very last on the list entitled to anything."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Be very careful with relying on book value, there are rules for calculating it but there is no rule saying they can't put things like adverts into book value.

03/23/2021,stocks,"Common likely wouldn't get anything. Exceptions are rare. 

There's a reason bond holders don't get much upside. They'll get asset worth if it comes down to it. Common equity will simply be erased even if restructured into new common shares.

If you want to make money here you don't buy common stock. But even then it's a silly thing to pursue. Bondholders may not get anything either. Look into the REIT that was formed out of old Sears buildings. Just shameful."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Moot point anyway. No corporation would file chapter 13 with a p/b ratio below one. It's proly never happened and never will.

03/23/2021,stocks,Say you'll get nothing
03/23/2021,stocks,Other posters are correct. Common shareholders  get nothing. Any value left will go to whomever takes over the companies debt. I had the fortune to get out of one such investment way before it went below 1 dollar.

03/23/2021,stocks,Nope. Common shareholders like yourself almost ALWAYS get nothing
03/23/2021,stocks,So can even a company with the p/b below 1 go bankrupt? This p/b ratio means that their assets are bigger than all liabilities combined.
03/23/2021,stocks,But the debt is already included in the P/B! There is the rest of money which is assets - liabilities. My question was what they do with this money.
03/23/2021,stocks,Gotcha.
03/23/2021,stocks,"If assets are hard to liquidate, why would they do it instead of declaring bankruptcy? Just to pay off the debt and then go bankrupt because they won’t have enough assets to make money? In this case, I have capital intensive companies on my mind like mines, of course."
03/23/2021,stocks,P/B doesn’t account for everything and oftentimes a bankrupt company can’t recoup full value of its assets.

I applied for margin privileges with TD Ameritrade today and was approved. My primary goal is not to use it, but have it available for writing spreads/PMCCs. All of my purchases have been in cash so far and my intent is to continue that going forward.

Now, a couple hours later I have a possible maintenance call warning on my account for being under my maintenance requirement. I called TD Ameritrade and the person I spoke with couldn't explain why purchases made with cash only had a margin maintenance requirement. In fact, that doesn't sound right at all and I've read the margin handbook through a dozen times now trying to figure this out.  I made a deposit just to make sure nothing bad happens, but I'm struggling to understand the mechanic here.

Why would I have margin maintenance requirements on cash purchases?"

Top and bottom line growth again this year.  This $13 stock can break $20 with a little retail interest and P/E expansion to market multiple.

OC:  Still trades at a huge discount to mkt despite strong earnings and even better outlook.  If there is a better/cheaper play in both reopening and red hot housing mkt, I haven’t found it!

03/23/2021,stocks,"There is absolutely no doubt that autonomous freight trucks is a big deal, and the question is which company/ies to invest in.  Have you done a full DD on TuSimple yet?  I would be very careful to see how they stand relative to competition.  The competition includes Tesla and these other companies (which I found in a [July 2020 Gearbrain article](https://www.gearbrain.com/autonomous-truck-startup-companies-2587305809.html)), and probably more:

* Embark.
* Daimler.
* Einride.
* Waymo.
* Volvo.
* Ike.

In my uneducated opinion, autonomous trucking is *definitely* something worth investing in.  It's just a matter of finding the right stocks to buy into.

I would also be interested in any ideas about related companies (i.e. not the trucks themselves) that will be affected by the inevitable transition to autonomous trucks."

03/23/2021,stocks,"Good morning. I believe in the tech, as well.  You make very good points on the competition, so here's my 2 cents: I've been a truck driver for 10 years now and my older brothers before me. At first, I laughed at the thought. Then came Tesla, and my mind opened. First, let me say that TuSimple has been the most successful so far and AF is all that they do. They've got trucks going to UPS, Budweiser, Amazon, US Express, etc. 
Daimler is Frieghtliner and they're so big, if they fail, it won't really matter. Their stock is up there already. Something went wrong with Waymo last year, I can't remember what, but I recall it was bad. Tesla was concentrating on electrification of trucks first, but are having problems with battery costs for trucks and have delayed production. Their stock is also pretty expensive.  Volvo is in the same area as Daimler,  Ike I haven't heard of yet and Embark is just getting to us news-wise. (Sorry about lack of spacing in this,  I'm on my mobile this morning). 
TuSimple looks like their launch is going to be this ninth or next, and priced low.
Anyway, as I said before, I'm a truck driver 10 years, investor for only 2. I definately think they have huge potential and wanted input from those more experienced in investing. I'm going to put my 400 bucks house money in it, to be honest. May sell some other stuff, in order to invest more, depending on input Iexa receive.  I thank you very, very much for yours. Edit:  exact date not set."

2021-03-23 07:04:00,stocks,"Why Microsoft would want to acquire Discord, which is reportedly exploring a $10B-plus sale https://www.geekwire.com/2021/microsoft-want-acquire-discord-reportedly-exploring-10b-plus-sale/

Discord is a popular app used by millions of gamers for low-latency voice chat and other communication. Due to social distancing measures and the general growth of the video game industry, Discord nearly doubled its userbase and saw revenue spike to $130 million in 2020. It was valued at $7 billion in December, and is reportedly is not yet profitable.

That would seem to leave Microsoft as the last real domestic contender here. It has pre-existing ties to Discord, as you can already link your Xbox account directly to the service; it’s certainly got the money, with $131 billion in total cash as of Dec. 31; and it’s reportedly still in the market for more gaming-focused acquisitions, even after finalizing its purchase of ZeniMax Media earlier this month.

This is a positive move to acquire discord. It will make msft more competitive and improve social media business, which might make it able to compete with facebook. It will definitely help the gaming business as well as msft putting more effort to improve the gaming revenue."
03/23/2021,stocks,"MSFT is addicted to social networks now as it made out like a bandit with LinkedIn. Social networks work out in several ways in MSFT favor: 1) they make a ton of money 2) the networks they buy become an automatic customer for their Azure web hosting business - one business feeds the other. 3) they can use the user data 4) they can sell business and consumer products (xboxes) to them. 

 Microsoft offered to buy Pinterest a few weeks ago but PINS turned them down so they went down the line and bought Discord instead. Watch them try to gobble up Clubhouse next. MSFT is playing chess while their competitors are playing checkers."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Discord Nitro tying into gamepass would be a very good model.

Maybe changing Xbox social structure more like discord? tho idk how good xbox social is.

03/23/2021,stocks,Microsoft aka the death angel.
03/23/2021,stocks,"Here to clear up some things as someone who's both a customer of Discord(i pay for Nitro), and part of the main demographic (teenagers)

&#x200B;

Microsoft has tie-ins with Discord doesn't really say anything, considering Twitch, YouTube, Blizzard, Steam, Reddit, Facebook, Twitter, Spotify all have the ability to connect to Discord to provide profile linking. 

&#x200B;

Furthermore, Discord's very much unlike any social media platform. It's basically Skype but with large communities, and a decent analogy would be a Skype + Reddit crossover. I don't know if Microsoft would be good at handling running such a platform, as they have never had a social media platform before (except for Yammer, which was an enterprise solution)

&#x200B;

I don't believe that Microsoft would be able to effectively handle the acquiring discord, in my opinion, but then again their acquisition of GitHub turned out to work out pretty well."
03/23/2021,stocks,Oh god they are going to fuck up another one.
03/23/2021,stocks,Large corps are just banks. Incapable of innovation. Like desert locusts. They get to your field of corn. Devour it all and jump to the next one.
03/23/2021,stocks,They are going to murder this platform just like skype.
03/23/2021,stocks,microsoft has alot of money and wants to buy everybody so they can gain market share
03/23/2021,stocks,As long as they dont implement xbox social features into discord its fine. Their xbox companion app is pretty bad and has been for 4 years
03/23/2021,stocks,Discord to PSTH?
03/23/2021,stocks,"But why would they do that? They have just finished integrating SKYPE practically everywhere. Sure it’s not as popular as it used to be, but it’s a working service with a name that cost a pretty penny. Buying two practically same companies would be a strange move."
03/23/2021,stocks,I just hope discord does not go the way of xfire.
03/23/2021,stocks,Its the closest thing to Slack without actually buying Slack.
03/23/2021,stocks,RIP Discord. RIP Bethesda.
03/23/2021,stocks,"Say goodbye to free Share Screen and many other important things :) 

One of the competitions in conference calls is zoom (which is more corporate than discord=gaming as most of us know it since the beginning as an alternative option to team speak) ...

03/23/2021,stocks,"As long as it is not given to the Skype team, it should be fine.  Skype rewrote their UI from scratch two or three times in the last ten years, without doing anything interesting or new.  If MS leaves it an open platform then it should be fine IMHO."

03/23/2021,stocks,Solidifies their grip on the PC gaming market.

03/23/2021,stocks,Wow
03/23/2021,stocks,"discord is by far the best communication software I use. BY FAR. Beats mircrosoft teams by a mile if you ask me. 

I just wonder about their monetization. Actually surprised by how many people shell out for the nitro already. share larger files? Meh, I’ll just upload to streamable and link it.  Boost someone’s server so they can have more emotes? meh. there’s some other features but it’s not worth $10 to me. And for those who do get it, probably the first thing they cut when rebudgeting. 

Just seems like a lot is being left on the table from a monetezation standpoint. It’s massively popular but completely free and the paid benefits simply aren’t at all enticing to most people. 

Maybe Microsoft sees this gap and thinks they can fill it by implementing ad spaces for free users, or leveraging the user base to push Microsoft platforms for gaming, or something"
03/23/2021,stocks,Please no. They’ll ruin it
03/23/2021,stocks,"Microsoft is trying to ruin Discord, what next ? Just leave it a loan."

Also, Nitro already has ties to GamePass, this way the GamePass would probably include Nitro with it."

03/23/2021,stocks,Microsoft teams is free tho? Or is my institution paying money for that which i didn't know
03/23/2021,stocks,You can Share your Screen with Skybe without an subscription. So they probably won’t change it. And Discord already has higher quality audio and video in it’s Nitro Subscription.
03/23/2021,stocks,2008 would like a word with this whole “too big to fail” concept you speak of.
03/23/2021,stocks,Everyone forgot about Skype and then went to Zoom after COVID to get their data harvested so now M$ likely wants to play ball with something new.
03/23/2021,stocks,But they will move to something else if discord becomes shit. It happens. All the time. As soon as something gets too ad filled or corped up people just move on.
03/23/2021,stocks,MSFT is not involved in any anti-monopoly discussions since they've already been fined 20 years ago
03/23/2021,stocks,"They aren't going to do shit, Trump was far more likely too do any break ups."
03/23/2021,stocks,Didn't oracle end up buying part of that business? Didn't they do some weird shit to get around the executive order? Cause if I'm not mistaken I thought that pretty much nothing changed in that whole ordeal.

03/23/2021,stocks,"Internal money is still money.

Put another way, let’s say that discord pays $50 million a year in cloud service fees. When Microsoft buys them they can either:

1. Provide cloud service to discord for free, therefor saving discord $50 million a year and making it look more profitable.
2. Have azure provide the service and collect the $50 million a year. Making azure look more profitable.
3. Split the difference and lock the service to azure but give discord a price break. Say they provide $40 million a year for cloud services.

Though 1 may seem easiest, most companies will go with 2 or 3. The reason being that each part of their business is measured in its profitability and having it provide free services to other parts of the company kills that. The executive team wants an accurate view on if their azure or discord is making money, and that’s difficult to do if azure is providing free cloud hosting to discord."
03/23/2021,stocks,"It also helps with marketing to be able to point out that they are hosting discord with its millions of users on Azure. Very few organisations will have higher requirements. And those that do, like Google, Amazon, etc already have their own cloud offerings."
03/23/2021,stocks,"No you're not, great question. As Discord grows it attracts users, which if housed by Azure then multiply the profits to underlying Azurr cloud provider. The key is that if Microsoft does not control Discord then Discord can choose Google Cloud or Amazon AWS and become a feather in their caps. Gaining a social network to host on your cloud service is a crown jewel for these providers as they are tremendously profitable for them as they ramp up and grow user base and add on features (i.e social shopping). Plus, MSFT would enjoy the added synergy of coupling Discord with their Xbox business."
03/23/2021,stocks,"i believe it opens new possibilities to interconnect their other services. you would order your discord server as a azure service, you may pay for enterprise support and high availability, it can be used as a streaming service and so on. i think they could cover multiple areas like this - Teams for Business, Discord for Freetime/Gaming. Meaning in a few years they could provide the complete infrastructure for everything you need and you just buy it as a service from Azure."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Well you’re adding the revenue from discord. At the moment Msft makes 0 off discord. When discord joins, they pay azure let’s say 10m. That’s 10m that wasn’t there before. Obviously it’s not worth it just for that bc they have to spend 10 billion to acquire discord but it does improve the revenue. Companies acquire for revenue all the time when they are flushed with cash."
03/23/2021,stocks,"I would argue there are several cash cows roaming said pasture when you think about Amazon, Facebook, Google and Apple. It's an ""eat or be eaten"" situation."
03/23/2021,stocks,Discord is a much better option than Slack imo. Literally every kid/teen/young adults use discord over the globe. Happy if the deal goes through
03/23/2021,stocks,">MSFT is thirsty for a chat app after losing Slack.

Like MS gobbling up other companies is anything new."
03/23/2021,stocks,Not a whole lot today - network effect ramps super quick as successful social media networks take off. Would be a nice pairing with their video game business so there are synergies there.

But like all things MS will use it to leverage the rest of its sordid monopoly. Plus all the data harvesting possible via accounts linked to Discord (Steam, Twitch, Amazon, Youtube, etc.) is an MS wet dream. MS would have an entry point into Google and Amazon's inner sanctum of customer data."
03/23/2021,stocks,">Discord is losing an insane amount of money. 

MS doesn't care about hosting costs."
03/23/2021,stocks,"In general, social media networks are wildly profitable. Refer to Facebook as an example."
03/23/2021,stocks,Bro...
03/23/2021,stocks,Native discord client for windows while teams is still on electron? I didn’t even think of the Xbox thing. This purchase makes a lot of sense.
03/23/2021,stocks,100% this.
03/23/2021,stocks,"If MS actually successfully finishes their live audio filtering, they're not gonna put it on discord. They're gonna sell it to literally every voice comm service on the planet and get (more) rich."
03/23/2021,stocks,"And Minecraft.

Which if you ask people, most would say is doing significantly better now compared to before the buy."
03/23/2021,stocks,"You can definitely feel the Microsoft in GitHub now. It’s not huge, but it’s there and the way things like this work, that’s always how it starts."
03/23/2021,stocks,MS hasn't touched GitHub or Minecraft yet. They are the same as when MS bought them. Give them a chance to screw them up.
03/23/2021,stocks,Yeah like mixer?...
03/23/2021,stocks,"RIP Nokia. RIP Skype. RIP Bethesda. RIP Discord.

Everything MS touches goes to hell.

Btw, how's Windows 10 doing? I need a patch for my patch to stop a bug I didn't even have before the patch. Satya hasn't improved anything except get MS some lucrative government contracts which makes MS look like it's doing much better than it really is. The consumer end is rotting from the inside. If consumers were able to run Win32 apps on something besides Windows natively it would be all over for MS because the OS itself is a worthless mess."
03/23/2021,stocks,They certainly made Skype worse. Felt like they were actively trying to push me and my friends away from using it. So we did and went to Discord. And here we are:)
03/23/2021,stocks,But they always get in trouble for antitrust that’s what bothers me
03/23/2021,stocks,"Interesting how people aren't up to date on how these companies have change their practices overtime.

Everyone thought GitHub was done for in 2018 when Microsoft acquired, yet here we are.

03/23/2021,stocks,But could they handle user moderate private severs?
03/23/2021,stocks,"Rarely. Why risk some capital when you can harvest others' investments.

 I've been in one of those successful startups acquired for quite some cash by a large Corp. They bring lots of money but no insight. Ruin the substance of the product, and the ideology behind it. Kill all projects that aren't immediately bankable. Introduce so much BS through marketing that what remains needs to be fixed to meet promises for which the initial products weren't designed for. Eventually the product dries out. The team gets blamed. The less performing employees get fired and the good ones leave. Only the 50+ guys stay there  unmotivated, looking at the ashes of something that was once a great visionary project. Looking back I'd have preferred we failed doing something with vision. Than just getting diluted in a mega Corp."

03/23/2021,stocks,You're right. Unfortunately the admintrative burden and fantastic layer cake ensures best ideas vanish in ppt slides. Been there. Seen that. So many fucking times. It was so frustrating most brilliant people left as soon as the retention bonus covered period ended.

03/23/2021,stocks,Does your institution have Word and Excel? Then it's paying [20$ per user per year](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ww/microsoft-teams/compare-microsoft-teams-options?market=af) most likely

03/23/2021,stocks,They didn’t buy the U.S. business. Just got a licensing deal to run their hosting infrastructure via Oracle’s cloud.
03/23/2021,stocks,"Never went down. Biden's turn to see if he propagates the whole ""threat to American security narrative"". All quiet so far."
03/23/2021,stocks,Yeah they did. I'm still a bit fuzzy on the details but I remember there was something odd going on.
03/23/2021,stocks,"What good does ""making"" one or the other look profitable do? It's still owned by the same company, who makes the same amount of money despite how it looks to everyone else."
03/23/2021,stocks,Problem is how will discord make money. I used it for years and boggles how they could ever make a profit. Slack customers are at least corporations so they're not going to bat an eye paying big for subscriptions
03/23/2021,stocks,"Slack is for business, and it's easily the market leader. Teams is what MSFT did after losing Slack, don't think discord has any relation apart from it's just as easy to use as Slack is. This seems more like a gaming focus."
03/23/2021,stocks,What? There is literally no correlation to Facebook here. Facebook sells ads. Discord does not.
03/23/2021,stocks,"It also makes a ton of sense if you consider Microsoft has been creating tool chains for Rust programming language for Windows. The new apps have a way to work in Xbox, too, and Discord uses Rust for many things. It could become something very robust.

If Discord accepts, and is treated like GitHub, we're going to have a very good product there"
03/23/2021,stocks,"*When MS* - fixed it :)  Seen live demos - it's not vapourware and it works surprisingly well.  ""Literally every voice comm service"" will likely translate to Discord Premium :)"

03/23/2021,stocks,"Meh if you compare bedrock to java i think most would say java is better.

What aspects specifically do you think are a problem?"
03/23/2021,stocks,"Like what? 

Still very much feels like GitHub to me. New features having been coming thick and fast ever since the acquisition. Maybe code spaces is the only MSFT thing because it runs on VS code? The implementation is amazing though, and VS code is widely used anyway.

I genuinly want to know what feels like MSFT in github."
03/23/2021,stocks,"From my limited experience Mixer failed from a lack of user engagement rather than being a poor product. Still believe the Zune was a much better media device than the iPod (both pretty much replaced by phones now but I digress). Survivorship bias isn't the best objective measure of a product, obviously commercially its almost all that matters but good products fail constantly."
03/23/2021,stocks,Mixer had to compete against Twitch so....
03/23/2021,stocks,"Mixer isn't discord... it failed as it came late in to the game and didn't have the numbers. Everybody and their mama was already on twitch. Mixer would be Google launching Google+ when Facebook is already well established. A little too late to just create a replica, hence Google's failure.

 Discord in comparison is already king(if not sharing the throne with slack) and is well established with 300+ million plus users(100 million active users a month). They don't need to fight to survive and become something big. They already are. 

So no this isn't the equivalent of buying mixer."
03/23/2021,stocks,Mixer/Beam wasn’t very successful when Microsoft bought them compared to Twitch. Microsoft grew the usage but they eventually just gave up on competing with Twitch because it’s a hard battle to fight. Owning discord you start up in a great position and is arguably easier to maintain from there.
03/23/2021,stocks,"Mixer was trying to go against the biggest powerhouse in the market right off the bat by buying streamers with contracts, everyone saw that it was dirty business and wanted nothing to do with it. Props to Ninja and Shroud for the big payouts when it finally failed though."
03/23/2021,stocks,Who? /s
03/23/2021,stocks,Teams replaced Skype. Bethesda was just bought so you need to give it time. And you just intentionally forgot Linkedin and GitHub didn't you?
03/23/2021,stocks,"Microsoft never bought Nokia. They bought a part of Nokia. Skype was a technical mess and gave the original Skype CEO a bunch of power. Skype failed because it wasn’t innovative and had technical problems while all these mobile-friendly chat apps appeared and Skype had to catch up while the others were innovating or just improving their experience further. Skype’s architecture was insecure, their most used app was insecure and needed to completely revamped, they didn’t have a working notification system in the age of push notifications, they didn’t have offline messaging or a good system to sync Skype messages across devices. All Skype had was a brand name and a user base, skype’s core feature set can be easily copied nowadays. Other companies built their backend systems with modern design principles and got a clean slate; and they built their apps using technologies that help lead to more rapid development. Whereas, Skype had to build off their existing  crappy infra/backend  to support all users and a had a bunch of problematic native apps and had horrible mobile devs.

In regards to Windows 10, QA could always be better but it’s not like other companies OS feature updates don’t introduce bugs (Microsoft is probably still one of the worst but they have a harder battle than say Apple to support such a variety of machines). Satya hasn’t done much for Windows 10, it wasn’t a huge priority for him because all the initiatives  started before he became CEO failed under him. He had a big focus on the cloud and mobile. Which has been arguably fairly successful. Mobile isn’t necessarily the smartphone business but a big push with satya was the office 365 revamp and making sure all the apps synced and contained a decent set of features."
03/23/2021,stocks,Literally none of those companies went to hell lol
03/23/2021,stocks,"This. Skype was fine before Microsoft got ahold of it and then just killed it with it's changes.

We don't trust them with Discord."
03/23/2021,stocks,That was Steve Ballmers MSFT which was horribly mismanaged. Its way better under Satya. I am a firm believer in him as a leader of MSFT. His book hitting refresh is fantastic.
03/23/2021,stocks,Umm...Teams anyone?  Skype was acquired for their video/audio compression codecs and  protocols. Skype was strip mined for consumers but if you've worked in any large enterprise recently I'd say it worked out quite nicely for MS.
03/23/2021,stocks,"Lol they never do. They tried to go after Microsoft in the 90s. After that failed, the laws might as well not exist."
03/23/2021,stocks,"No one large has actually be broken up for quite a while, regulatory capture was successful and the government is toothless thanks to corp cronies occupying high positions.

The only and best example you need is Pai and the FCC"
03/23/2021,stocks,"Honestly, discord will be better. I have been using discord for a few years now and honestly I don’t think the experience has changed significantly at all once, and there’s plenty of spots to improve or innovate. If I had to choose someone to buy Discord, it would be Microsoft. Their track record in recent years has been very good."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Typescript?  VSCode?  Azure?  C#?

Microsoft does a ton of innovation work in the software space.  These are just the items off the top of my head.

EDIT: MSFT is also one of the largest single company contributors to the FOSS community.  If that's not an indicator of ""innovation"", then...."
03/23/2021,stocks,[deleted]
03/23/2021,stocks,"Microsoft has been quite innovative. You can point to plenty of other tech stocks, including FAANG stocks, that have been less innovative then Microsoft over the last 5 years."
03/23/2021,stocks,Just wait for the Xbox Series One X
03/23/2021,stocks,"Well, here's the problem - there are innovations, ones that are pretty major and extremely useful for customers, but if I mention some you will just say either that they are not innovative or impressive enough, or that they were actually invented somewhere else.  E.g. Windows Virtual Desktop - it is a game changer for many businesses, but it has its roots in remote desktop and terminals of the 1970's, and there have been other contenders.

03/23/2021,stocks,"It informs a wide variety of internal business decisions. Where should they invest more or less. What parts of their businesses are succeeding or failing. If a product is even profitable.

Let's say you make cars and for years you have been buying door handles from an external supplier. They cost $100 each. You decide that you want to bring door handle production in-house.

When you setup your internal door handle production you still charge the car business $100 a door handle. But after running for a year you notice that the door handle business is running a huge profit (it only costs them $50 per door handle to make them). Assuming all other metrics are similar (quality/timeliness/etc) you start thinking about increasing your door handle business and making door handles for other companies.

Because of internal money it's easy to see where the success is. Without it. it would have appeared as if the car manufacturing business just got better (they were paying $100 for each door handle and now they are getting them for ""free""). Which is both misleading and incentivizes a company to do everything internally so they don't have to ""pay"" for them."

Most streamers already have their own Discord for their communities. Why keep using two platforms if Discord could centralize their many communities a bit on a front page? Embrace the community aspect more and you'll have more and more users willing to drop money to gain access to specific chat rooms for their community, get emotes for other channels, giveaways, join lets plays etc.

I wouldn't consider this their main way of making money, but it's a way to take advantage of the already huge amount of community Discord has, while trying to centralize the platform a bit so you can actually browse it."

Months ago, even before becoming publicly traded via reverse merger, Fisker was hyped as the next Tesla.

Henrik Fisker has aimed to build the company as the next Tesla.  The Foxconn manufacturing deal is part of this goal, and so is the Magna manufacturing deal.

However, it is an [earlier negotiating failure](https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/21355123/fisker-quantumscape-lawsuit-trade-secret-solid-state-batteries-fsr-qs) that has proved that Fisker does not have the acumen to see the next Tesla even if it was right before him.

In fact, not seeing the Next Tesla literally is exactly what unfolded.

On the other hand, what value could Fisker itself have brought to the table?  Perhaps it was this very negotiating failure that caused the Next Tesla to develop its own in-car operating systems."

It’s a long shot but the Foxconn and Magna deals are very interesting plus the magna CEO has gone on the record saying he’s excited about working with Fisker.  Also project PEAR is either an idiotic troll or a tongue in cheek nod that the deal has already happened.

Apple will most likely choose a partner with its car endeavors.  Fisker has the California/European vibe, sustainability, nice price tag, and the cars are really good looking. Most importantly they are already involved with the manufacturers Apple will be looking at to build their own car.  No way Apple will build car factories.  Unlikely they will partner with a large car brand with their own factories. 

Also a few months ago I saw someone in the daily thread saying he worked in HVE and could guarantee the Fisker deal was happening. Of course he never provided proof but he was so sure of himself in some weird way that it really convinced me.

Anyway it’s a serious long shot and I’ve made the gamble (bought in at 25...lol but again yesterday) in the hopes this thing happens.   Big long shot gamble so wish me luck!"

The American CPU designers (Intel and AMD especially) don't like the idea of Nvidia having the best GPU technology and really competitive CPUs (probably the best for some purposes) and they say it'd be a monopoly. 

Analysts always said it was a question whether or not it would go through. There's not really much news on that front though, it's pending review.

2021-03-23 06:27:05,stocks,"Thoughts on European telecom diversification plays. So this is going to serve as a bit of DD and Discussion but I’m wanting to hear others opinions on these companies and hear what y’all’s outlooks are on them vs mine. 

So first up is Vodafone Group PLC (VOD); a company that pays semiannual dividends with a 5.7% yield, a current price around $18.65, a PT between $22.60-$25.48, an average PT of $24.04 and a P/B ratio of only .76. Looking at these numbers alone it seems like VOD is undervalued and when you look at their expansion into Africa and India as well as cementing their status as Europe’s discount cell service for all backpackers/tourists/Americans stationed overseas (they actually have contracts with the US military to sell their phones and chips directly to Americans on base in the military’s PX’s and BX’s)/students studying abroad you can see how qualitatively they also have a lot going for them. Personally I’m looking to begin dollar cost averaging in to VOD as I find both their yield and growth prospects attractive. Not to mention I used them while I was living in Germany and so did every single kid in my school. 

The second company I would like to discuss with y’all is Deutsche Telekom (DTE.DE) or for those of us in the states (DTEGY). DTEGY pays only a yearly dividend with a 3.47% yield and trades around $19.65 with a PT range between $15.53-$29.82, an average TP of $23.85 and a much more average P/B ratio of 2.16. While these numbers aren’t as great as VOD it is still the largest telecommunication provider in all of Europe, and also owns like 45% of T-mobile so they are getting a large amount of revenue from America’s 3rd largest cellular network. While I haven’t found anything on them expanding into emerging markets I have seen their recent huge investments into 5G and how they are making moves to solidify their 5G network to maintain their largest in Europe status. 

So do y’all have any thoughts on VOD and DTEGY? Personally I’m going to be buying a few shares of both and just watch how 5G continues to roll out. I also like them as they offer me some international exposure and diversification. Personally I hate AT&T due to dealing with them for years as a customer and as such don’t want to invest in them but still want some more communication sector diversification outside of VZ and DIS that still pays a decent dividend.

What about the Next Tesla?

Thanks to guidance from Deutsche Bank, the Next Tesla, Volkswagen, Das Auto, should be worth at least $1.1 trillion USD, or over €0.9 trillion, by 2025.

[As of yesterday, Volkswagen's ICE and hybrid business should have been worth €181.2 billion.  Its consumer EV business proper should have been worth between €195.0 billion to €479.1 billion.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ma2gyz/dd_valuation_of_the_next_tesla_grossly/)

So, how does the grossly undervalued Volkswagen get to €0.9 trillion by 2025?

Next year, the company intends to increase this by at least two-fold, such that the sales mix is 6%.  Expect anywhere between 463,200 and 500,000 EVs.  [Deutsche Bank's conservative valuation of €195.0 billion for the consumer EV business today](https://fortune.com/2021/03/22/volkswagen-vw-db-report-ev-business-tesla/) is surely based on lower numbers.

By 2025, the company intends to achieve a consumer EV sales mix of approximately 20%.  Expect approximately 1,544,000 EVs, or between 1.5 million and 1.6 million EVs.

Without taking into account inflation, consumer EV revenues should be in the neighborhood of €36.98 billion.

Every bubble play has a price-to-sales multiple of at least 20.  Even Deutsche Bank has conceded this distinguished multiple for the likes of Nio, despite that pure play EV maker having lower gross margin percentages than Tesla.  **Therefore, the consumer EV business should be worth at least €739.7 billion by 2025.**

All this is how the Next Tesla, Volkswagen, Das Auto, can reach a value of at least €920.9 billion, or over $1.1 trillion USD, by 2025.

03/23/2021,stocks,I feel like it’s an aggressive timeline for TSLA. So many companies are committing to be full EV in the coming years. TSLAs main benefit right now is that they’re basically the only big only EV producer. Once competition starts to flood in I feel like this crazy growth could get shunted
03/23/2021,stocks,So I should invest I. Tesla?
03/23/2021,stocks,Only 2.9 trillion? I’ve heard 6 trillion maybe even 8 trillion debatably 10 trillion
03/23/2021,stocks,Tesla has more chance to be worth $0 than $2.9T. We get it she likes Elon. Tesla has never made a profit selling a car and they have no plan to materialize that. They are running out of credits to sell and will only face more competition. The chickens are coming to roost. The money on Tesla has already been made.
03/23/2021,stocks,Tesla is going nowhere
03/23/2021,stocks,The vw can go 250 miles. Not sure that will work in the us.
03/23/2021,stocks,[deleted]
03/23/2021,stocks,"I'm not as optimistic about Ford or GM, let alone Toyota.

[Which is why I bought POAHY, the indirect VWAGY play, instead of those legacy automakers.]"
03/23/2021,stocks,"It's too late to get a ten-bagger with Tesla at this point.

Volkswagen is the best shot at the next EV ten-bagger."
03/23/2021,stocks,Would you care to explain to me how TSLA goes to zero with $21B in the bank?
03/23/2021,stocks,"They were actually profitable last few quarters.  Despite the expenses from ongoing research and new factories in the U.S., Germany, and China."
03/23/2021,stocks,Tesla has cult following like apple. Tesla has way bigger potential than apple. I like apple too. Tesla to  $4000.
03/23/2021,stocks,"To the moon! (Literally. The car, not the stock, lol.) I feel like Tesla trades as a proxy to all of Elon's shenanigans, not just as a car company. As a car company, grossly overvalued. As ""Elon stock,"" not sure. Mostly speculative, hard to value."
03/23/2021,stocks,What car are you referring to? The ID3 with the biggest battery has a range of 340 Miles
03/23/2021,stocks,"Yeah man, it's very shitty. But what's that have to do with this post?"
03/23/2021,stocks,So... Where we going?
03/23/2021,stocks,Most Japanese companies do things quietly and even if they publicize it’s only in Japanese. So unless u read Japanese I wouldn’t write them off
03/23/2021,stocks,Thank you for the advice
03/23/2021,stocks,"Over what timeframe? Worth 0.645T now. +$5T by 2030 or so. That's close to 10x, but over 9 years.  


Volkswagon is to be Bing to Tesla's Google. They're fighting for second place and they know it."
03/23/2021,stocks,FORD THO
03/23/2021,stocks,"They don't have $21B. They have tons of debt and raised capital by issuing more shares to Robinhood traders. Because you know, a company that is so sure in it's balance sheet needs to issue shares at all times high..."
03/23/2021,stocks,They don't make a single net cent from selling a car. Read their accounting it's public info.
03/23/2021,stocks,"Man I like both, but this sounds ridiculous"
03/23/2021,stocks,"I believe TSLA is in some form of infinite squeeze, so yeah the moon is possible lol"
03/23/2021,stocks,Someone on the news mentioned a small vw with a 250 range. It will sell and has a niche. And I know nothing about evs. Or how long it takes to charge.
03/23/2021,stocks,[deleted]
03/23/2021,stocks,"I'd suggest HYMTF if you don't like TSLA at this price (not sure I blame you). They're down $10 per share from their ATH in early February, are just down the road from one of the world's largest battery manufacturers (LG Chem), and just launched a dedicated EV brand in Ioniq.

They also have less marketshare than VW (more room to grow) and some of the most efficient EVs in the market with hedges in fuel cells, conventional hybrids, and plug-in hybrids.

VWAGY is a very large cap that has gone up 40% in the last month on-as far as I can tell-no significant news."
03/23/2021,stocks,Tesla is way more likely to crash 80% at $2.9 trillion than it is to go to $5 trillion.
03/23/2021,stocks,Ford sucks.  End of story.
03/23/2021,stocks,"If a company believes its stock is overvalued currently (as Musk has said more than once) then it's stupid not to raise capital to fund growth, strengthen their balance sheet, or both.

FWIW you're right it's not $21B though. It's ONLY $19.3B which is still more than their total debt.

You need to update your numbers friend. XRX and HP haven't gone bankrupt and they've been mismanaged for decades."
03/23/2021,stocks,"They have enviable automotive margins. Read their accounting info. It's public. Money teeters on zero profit because they're investing in themselves. Austin and Berlin are being built out. Shanghai is expanding a 3rd phase. Fremont keeps getting upgraded, etc."
03/23/2021,stocks,The  ID3 (golf size) with the smallest battery has 213~ miles as a range. The smallest EV Volkswagen offers is a eUp with 161 Miles range. They're both pretty good in their price range and I don't think there's a similar EV close in their price range with similar quality and range. Charging time I don't know personally
03/23/2021,stocks,That’s how not to get the date... dating advice
03/23/2021,stocks,Bro why tf are you posting in every comment section on this sub. I get it and my heart goes out to the victims but this is a stock subreddit. Like go away and post this stuff somewhere else.
03/23/2021,stocks,VWAGY went up because of retail reaction to the Investor Presentation in the OP.
03/23/2021,stocks,"Then step right up and place your bets.

In the short term the market is a voting machine. In the long term its a weighing machine.

Set yourself a 'remind me', everyone is on the threads I happen to visit."
03/23/2021,stocks,Ford has a government tax incentive atm that no other automaker has right now and is responsible for Teslas fall in market share this past year
03/23/2021,stocks,That exactly the point. They know they are over valued which means there is less chance aka probability of them going to $2.T which is what the original post was about...
03/23/2021,stocks,What lol literally everyone knows they can't and don't make a single cent selling cars. They are also booking produced cars in revenue. You should read their accounting and do actual math. It's literally not a secret and one of the biggest criticism of them 😂
03/23/2021,stocks,[deleted]
03/23/2021,stocks,"If you got in early then congrats, but I wouldn't trust it to not retrace its way down on the first sign of bad news.

I'll also say that your reasoning about valuing VW's existing business seems wrong. If and when the EV market expands the valuation of its ICE business will go down so I wouldn't treat that as stagnant."
03/23/2021,stocks,"I already did.  I'm just long on VW.

Once upon a time, there was Yahoo.  It was the king of search engines.

Then Google came along.

Could Tesla be Yahoo instead of Google?"
03/23/2021,stocks,"Overvalued at present numbers sure. How much do you value 3 TWh of battery manufacturing capacity at if they pull that off?

I'm saying there's a chance, while I see no chance of a TSLA bankruptcy at this point. All of the scenarios people give for one include something like demand dropping to zero overnight."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Let the people read.

Start on pages 4 and 5 are the most relevant.

2020:
Auto revenue: 27.236B
of that, 1.58B was ZEV credit

Auto Gross Profit: 6.977B
Auto Gross Margin: 25.6%

Hell, I'll even make it an image for an easy click.

They invest in the company. They're building factories, plural. Upgrading and installing new tech. It's not a secret, it's just overlooked by people like you.

Just because a lot of people are using what you're saying as a criticism doesn't make them right."
03/23/2021,stocks,I’m trying to read about the future of Tsla
03/23/2021,stocks,"Developing countries without EV infrastructure will still need ICE cars.  By 2025, the sales mix should only be 20% for EVs.  Even by 2030, with the sales mix being 50%, VW is not going to abandon the ICE market where there's no EV infrastructure."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Maybe.

Is VW developing a structural pack for better safety, cost, weight, and range?

Is VW lowering he kwh / $$$ for like-to-like chemistry and density cells?

Is VW pioneering low cost construction methods like cast frames and stainless steel exoskeletons?

How's VW's cash on hand compared to their debt and the price to re-engineer all their manufacturing lines? I have an answer to this one. Something like \~80B cash and \~200B debt vs \~20B cash and \~10B debt.

I can't rule it as an impossibility that Tesla doesn't keep the lead. But it's more likely than not IMO.  


EDIT: Also, VW doesn't have a lead in self driving or an energy generation business or energy storage business."
03/23/2021,stocks,[deleted]
03/23/2021,stocks,"Markets don't value shrinking sectors and there's nothing to say that VW will maintain marketshare in that sector either given that their home turf in Europe is where the most EV growth is likely to occur percentage-wise in the near-term.

It will have value, I just wouldn't value it the same as today."
03/23/2021,stocks,"You know there's an auto company, specifically an EV company, which builds energy products - both storage and generation. Might be worth looking into..."
03/23/2021,stocks,Do you know how many murders take place in a typical summer weekend for Chicago... You are  desensitized to deaths in my communities...

2021-03-23 04:32:27,stocks,"Is it typical to see more buying or more selling going into earnings and what would either direction indicate? You see a lot of people talking about “Buy the rumor sell the news” which leads me to think people buy into earnings, but what would that indicate? If people are selling into earnings that seems really bearish. Is it better to have IV stay stable? Thoughts?"
03/23/2021,stocks,Literally anything and everything could be potentially interpreted from those moves going into earnings. Welcome to the shitshow
03/23/2021,stocks,Many people will place a straddle option on stocks going into earnings season. As earnings date nears IV increases raising option premiums. The day after earnings date  the IV decreases as do the option premiums. You don’t hold until expiry. Not investment advice.
03/23/2021,stocks,It depends. There are companies where beating earnings is baked into the current price and it’ll tank on a miss or match of projections while beating earnings holds the price stable. There are also companies that are valued below earnings projections and a match will rocket the price. It just takes a lot of research to find out which is the case and hope you guessed right. Personally I use earnings as reassurances I like the underlying company and value I think the stock has.
03/23/2021,stocks,"My rule is don’t play earnings. It’s a gamble, as good news can be perceived as bad and vice versa."
03/23/2021,stocks,In my experience there is both buying and selling leading up to earnings which is usually good or bad.  Once earnings get released there’s usually a lot of buying and selling.  When a company beats earnings people will either buy or sell and when a company misses earnings people will usually buy and sell.  Pretty easy to see I think...
03/23/2021,stocks,"There is no “typical” for earnings. 

That said, MOGO releases earnings after market tomorrow, 23 March. They’re a breakout company getting ready to establish themselves as perpetually profitable, and they’ve had a strong run-up the last few days only to sell off hard today while the rest of Nasdaq chugged right along. 

If nothing else, MOGO’s release this week will make for an interesting observation of earnings. (For a somewhat anchored perspective, I have gone full yo lo, and I am looking for CAD$10m revenue and CAD$1.5m net income, and looking for encouraging membership/user growth. If it hits those targets, it’s firmly on its path to the moon, regardless of what the share price does.)

Disclosure: 4750 shares, 6.91 CB."

2021-03-23 04:32:27,stocks,"My Watchlist For 3/23/2021 $ACCO - What a beautiful value here, we got support, trend line, and 200EMA bounce? Beautiful man this is great. Love it.

&#x200B;

$EAF  - What a beautiful trend line up here. It is testing the volume line and support now, right above the 200EMA line too. Indicators all low, love it.

&#x200B;

$ETON - Beautiful trend line up but also a super strong support as well. Indicators are low, but EMA lines will be resistances moving forward. 

&#x200B;

$HEI  - Gorgeous trend up as well, but the support is super strong right here. All indicators are low and curling North and showing life.

&#x200B;

$KNL  - check 10Y chart, $KNL does the massive runs which is crazy. I would re-take the 50EMa again, but what a beautiful run up right near a bunch of supports.

&#x200B;

$LPG  - Trend up is beautiful making a horizontal triangle now. I think we can squeeze more juice outta this bad boy, so I may wait on it. I love this play though.

&#x200B;

$PDD  - we have a support play right after this massive sell off due to earnings. Do not catch a falling knife, but eventually this will be a great play eventually.

&#x200B;

$RCM  - This is a long trend up, so idk how strong it is but I like it. This support is getting close as well, I think $24 is doable too. Indicators all low as well.

&#x200B;

$TACO - DUDE THE TICKER IS TACO?! WHO NEEDS ANYTHING ELSE. IF you do, beautiful trend up, strong support, and EMA line support. I am moist bros."
03/23/2021,stocks,These read like a Bob Ross episode. Here's a beautiful little stock right next to my happy gorgeous horizontal triangle.
03/23/2021,stocks,Some of those ACCO calls...oh my.
03/23/2021,stocks,Who doesn't like TACOs.  This companies got a future. 😀
03/23/2021,stocks,Good stuff brother
03/23/2021,stocks,Funny because my YT I am screaming the whole time hahahahahaha
03/23/2021,stocks,"Is there anything that would make any of those calls worth it though?
They haven't hit $10 since 2018"
03/23/2021,stocks,I fucking love Tacos bro lol
03/23/2021,stocks,"Some of them are so low cost that you could easily profit simply by the call getting closer to the money and then selling. A few of them would be cheaper than buying even a handful of shares.

Obviously speculative in nature but worth considering. You’re only betting on a return to value to a point, not any further."
03/23/2021,stocks,Gotcha! Thanks man
2021-03-23 04:03:29,stocks,selling in a custodial account. I'm thinking of getting a custodial account but I haven't been able to find the answer to this question. Can I sell the stocks before I turn 18? Maybe not get the money for them before I turn 18 but at least have the money waiting for me. Im Canadian going to use Wealthsimple Trade.
03/23/2021,stocks,In the US no you cannot. The custodian has 100% control of the account until you hit age of majority (18 in most states). Not sure if the rules are different in Canada but I doubt it
03/23/2021,stocks,Yes. I buy and sell on my daughters custodial account all day long.
03/23/2021,stocks,WS doesn’t have custodial accounts yet
03/23/2021,stocks,"Why do you want to sell if you can’t pull out.? You’re losing potential gains, and essentially guaranteeing that you lose purchasing power to inflation."
03/23/2021,stocks,but can the custodian sell the stocks?
03/23/2021,stocks,"Canadian rules will probably be stricter if different at all.  We have in trust accounts here but same thing, the minor doesn’t trade."
03/23/2021,stocks,but I can still choose the stocks just need the custodian to buy them on the app yes?
03/23/2021,stocks,Really? It's listed on their site so I just assumed they had it. Are there any other brokerages I could try?
03/23/2021,stocks,Yes
03/23/2021,stocks,Yes. The “custodian”. If my daughter was old enough to do it I’d give her my email and password and put the app on her phone. But she’s only 1.
03/23/2021,stocks,None that are free in Canada. You can still have your parents open an account in WS and give you access which is basically the same thing as a custodial. Your name just wouldn’t be on it. I know WS has it in motion to make custodial accounts available on their app but I’m unsure if the timeline.
03/23/2021,stocks,does the custodian have to purchase the shares as well?
03/23/2021,stocks,"Hi. May I ask why not just open an account in your name and just know that you are saving for her?  What’s the actual benefit of custodian?  

I am considering it as well just don’t see the obvious benefit."
03/23/2021,stocks,Yes
03/23/2021,stocks,I have the same question if you happen to get an answer. Thinking about starting a custodian account for my 8 month old but why not just create an additional account for him??
03/23/2021,stocks,You can gift them $10k/year tax free. If you keep it in your name you’re taxed on it when you withdraw.
03/23/2021,stocks,Taxable to the child rather than the custodian. You save a little money
03/23/2021,stocks,"ok, aslong as the stocks can be sold before I turn 18 then I'm good with that."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Right. My child is 12. And I know I have to relinquish control of custodian at 18. And while I am 100% sure that I have the most incredible kid in the planet, there is still a tiny chance that maybe relinquishing all money to the 18 year old may not be the best idea, depending on the individual of course. 😂"
03/23/2021,stocks,"Hi. Here is my understanding about gift rules in US:

1.  You don’t have to sell.  You can give stock as is, in which case the child will be responsible for capital gains taxes when he/she sell it. Same as it would be in a custodian account. 

2.  There is $15k annual gift limit, $30k if it is from two parents. You can still give more than $15k but that would have to come out from the lifetime tax-free amount which is currently set to over $11M. 

So at this point still not sure if there is any benefit. 

If anyone finds flaw in my reasoning please let me know. Yes I know - I can call my estate attorney :)."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Haha hilarious, my wife and I made the same comment. Well if you happen to get an answer and don’t mind sharing, I’d appreciate it."
03/23/2021,stocks,">You can still give more than $15k but that would have to come out from the lifetime tax-free amount which is currently set to over $11M. 

Lol yeah if I end up having enough money to gift out $11 million ill just pay the tax, haha."
03/23/2021,stocks,Right?  That’s my thinking too. And I would definitely then contact 5 estate and tax attorneys :)
2021-03-23 03:36:47,stocks,"The Wolf of Wall Street Says You're Getting Fleeced By The Brokers and Market Makers As more retail investors become interested in investing in the financial markets, the more information available to the general public, the better.

Recently, there have been some [Congressional hearings in the US](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/17/business/gamestop-hearing.html) in the wake of the ongoing Gamestop saga in which questions have been  raised over the practice of Payment for Order Flow (PFOF) which has become more common and a core part of the business model for no commission trading pioneered by Robinhood.

While  PFOF is not a new practice, it is seemingly becoming more common as  more brokerages follow Robinhood's model in order to compete for the burgeoning retail trading business.  At least in the US, it appears fewer brokerages are now offering the traditional commission based trading structure:  Fidelity, Merrill Edge, Interactive Brokers (but not their newer ""IBKR Lite"" platform) are some examples (are there more?).

PFOF is banned in at least two other jurisdictions: the UK and Canada.

Rightly maligned for his prior fradulent behaviour in his pump and dump ""boiler-room"" schemes where he took up to $200 million from investors, the infamous ""Wolf of Wall Street"" recently gave an interview in which  he discussed the topic at hand, shedding a bit more light on the practice:

[Fortune interview with Jordan Belfort, the ""Wolf of Wall Street""](https://fortune.com/2021/03/21/bitcoin-stock-market-jordan-belfort-small-investors-wolf-of-wall-street-interview/)

>""It's the most expensive 'free trade' you can have,"" says Belfort. ""I saw a marketing demo from one of the big 'free trades' players advertising  how they were 'helping the little guy,' and they're hand in hand with the big guys. It was like a betrayal of trust."" He says that market makers pay so much for order flow because it gives them an exclusive  window into where the market is moving. When firms see tons of orders coming in for Tesla, they can purchase shares for their own account, pushing up the EV-maker's prices for their clients when the next flood of orders arrives. ""Order flow is everything,"" he says. ""It tells you where the market is going next. It gives the high-frequency market makers a crystal ball and puts the small investor at a big information    disadvantage. Seeing all that order flow gives a market maker information that the public doesn't have.""  
>  
>..  
>  
>In his example, if the market maker buys XYZ at $50.01 and sells at $50.09, it makes a fat, 8¢ spread. But if the firm ""worked the order"" by seeking buyers willing to pay a bit more, it could purchase for on behalf of its client at $50.05, and sell at $50.06. The seller gets 4¢ more, the buyer gets 3¢ off, and the trade costs the little guy just 1¢ instead of 8¢. ""Traders' compensation depends on marking up trades and  keeping wide spreads,"" he says. ""You'd have to be Mother Teresa not to fall for that temptation.""

[Investopedia Article: What is Payment for Order Flow?](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/paymentoforderflow.asp)

>..payment for order flow is a practice pioneered by [Bernard Madoff](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bernard-madoff.asp)—the same Madoff of Ponzi scheme notoriety.  
>  
>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said, in a [special study](https://www.sec.gov/news/studies/ordpay.htm) on PFOF published in December 2000, “Payment for order flow is a method of transferring some of the trading profits from market making to the brokers that route customer orders to specialists for execution.” 

[Payment for Order Flow is banned in the UK](https://www.cfainstitute.org/en/advocacy/policy-positions/payment-for-order-flow-in-the-united-kingdom)

[Payment for Order Flow is also prohibited in Canada](https://www.gbm.scotiabank.com/content/dam/gbm/market-insights/etf/october/2019-10-02-Free-Trading.pdf)

The SEC ultimately decided against banning the practice in the US, citing the potential benefit to investors in encouraging competition that would presumably increase execution quality.

One last link: [the SEC charged Robinhood in 2020 for misleading customers about revenue sources and failing to satisfy the duty of best execution (fining them $65 million).](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-321)

What are your thoughts on PFOF?  Does knowing about it affect your choice of brokerage?  Should it be banned in more jurisdictions?"
03/23/2021,stocks,"Well duh lol. It was even worse in the 80s and 90s, the fees you had to pay to trade and the amount of insight you had into what was going on behind the scenes was lame. 

This is why I do limit orders on my broker, not market orders."
03/23/2021,stocks,"yeah but I've always wondered,

years ago when we were paying a commission, **weren't they still fleecing us?**"
03/23/2021,stocks,"Interesting.  I didn't know this practice was banned in Canada.  That would explain why all the brokers up here have so many fees attached to them instead of being ""free"" like you see so often in the US now."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Stop spamming this shit. And fuck Jordan Belfort, he's in it to get attention on himself, not because he gives a shit about anyone else.

PFOF was already big back in Jan before Belfort had any input."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Jordan Belfort is a scammer and a scumbag human being, he is just riding the celebrity after the movie, I wouldn't listen to anything that comes out of his mouth"

03/23/2021,stocks,"I think too much is made of this.  PFOF just spreads the market-making profits to different players.  In the old days, when prices were quoted in 1/8 of a dollar (12.5 cents), the market makers (largely NYSE members) made huge profits from the retail trader, as well as the broker who charged [high commissions](https://www.businessinsider.com/historical-trading-commissions-2014-3) to execute the trade.  

Now with 1 cent price increments and cut-throat competition among market makers, that easy money has been given largely back to the retail investor.  I'm fine with that.

PFOF doesn't guarantee profits to the market-maker because he can't see the whole market stairstep.  Much of the information has shifted to control of the dark pools, where each sponsor has different rules for trade-matching and price setting.  That's where they see the big volume coming from the mutual funds and pensions.

But information is information, and that's why the brokerages get a fraction of a penny to route trades to certain market makers, and in general, this is a much better market for retail traders than the old specialist-firm days."

The amount of profit made by the broker or the intermediary by having knowledge of order flow is smaller than the commissions that would have been paid without it. Brokers only go along with it because 0 commissions is the competitive price. And the information is imperfect, because competition for order flow fractionates the data, so the aggregate effect on market prices and order-tracking profits is not as big as it could be if there was a monopoly in the flow."

03/23/2021,stocks,"Highest/lowest (depends on which side of buy/sell you're on). Exchanges have to match up lots of different orders for buying and selling at specific prices (that's what level 2 data shows you...), you don't always get the lowest price *that exists* if you're buying because someone else might have placed their buy order in ahead of you, or might have a lower price than you.

For instance if you have a buy order for $50, someone else has a buy for $45, and there are *sell* orders for $45 and $47, you might get matched with the 47 and he might get matched with the 45, so that you both get filled. Your order therefore fills at 47 but the lowest fill for the day is at 45. Or you might buy at $50 but then *later in the day* the price drops and someone sells some shares for $42 or something.

2021-03-23 03:02:45,stocks,"Score Media and Gaming: The Next Gambling Monster? To clarify this is my first DD, sorry if it looks messy and unformatted I am doing my best. I am bullish on the Score and hold 33 shares at a 32.59 CAD AVG. I intend on adding more once my swings either pay me out or inevitably hit my stop loss. I am not even remotely close to a financial advisor, I just started trading recently, so it is not a wise idea to buy or sell anything because of me.

Ticker:SCR

Marketcap:1.3bil USD

Shares outstanding:50 mil The Float:28mil

AVG Volume:330,000

All numbers from FINVIZ

CEO:John Levy 

Also the SCR just wen through an aggressive 10 to 1 r/S to get listed on the NASDAQ so institutional investors would take them seriously, which can explain why some of your charts may look funky. The r/S initially had the $SCR jump up to 54 CAD but then went down to like 26 CAD, now it seems to be consolidating in the low 30s.

The Bull Case

TheScore media is a Canadian based media company which is looking to get into the online gambling industry. The Score is the third biggest sports app in North America and biggest in Canada. The familiarity with the brand should be massive in Canada, and some experts have predicted Ontario itself to have 2-3 billion in annual revenue from sports betting (probably thanks to the Leafs sucking ass when it counts). Online gambling has been a craze with legalization becoming more imminent, and governments wanting to rake in that extra tax revenue.

Canada has just recently passed bill C-218, which aims to legalizes all single game sports betting. There is another reading tomorrow, where John Levy will be present to speak. Trudeau and his liberals also seems super pumped about passing this bill, as it can be a way to pay back CERB and other covid related debts.

PENN owns a 4.1% stake in the SCR and there have been buyout rumours from DKNG. Both want the brand that the Score owns. TheScore also has a partnership with PENN, where theScore bet app can be in states that PENN is in, as theScore is currently operating in Colorado, Iowa, Indiana and, New Jersey. As other states are set to legalize, theScore is hoping to get a piece of the American pie. Canada it will be much less complicated to operate.

PENN's market cap is 16.89 billion and Draftkings (DKNG) is 26.79 billion. Although I do not think $SCR will reach that anytime soon, it demonstrates the room for improvement.

SCR also just closed the 186 million IPO in the USA. They have lots of cash to throw at ads and others things a sports books will need.

They are also doing aggressive promos, like a $500 first bet risk-free. I have not used the app as I am Canadian and it is not available yet, but looking at videos and pictures, it looks clean. [https://www.thescore.bet](https://www.thescore.bet/)

Macquarie today initiated coverage on $SCR with an outperform rating and a $44 price target, and they are known for giving pretty conservative ratings. It is exciting that the score is getting the attention it deserves.

My PT is $70ish EOY and $150ish by 2025, but I also pulled these numbers out of my ass so don't base anything off of them.

BEARISH CASE

I am afraid of off-shore sports books already taking away a lot of the revenue of people who are already betting. Before I got into investing I used to bet with Betway and was confused why my money was being converted into pounds and it was always advertising soccer. I didn't realize what I was doing was illegal and many others don't. Also I don't think a ton of people would change apps unless the government tried to ban them or something. I am not very knowledgeable in the offshore sports books world.

Also DKNG and PENN are such monsters that they could just smother us with there promos and ads.

TLDR:$SCR is a media company which is turning to online gambling for sports. There is a lot of room for improvement. IANAFA. Do your own DD.

Any feedback on my first DD would be greatly appreciated. I know this isn't super complex with TA or financials, as I am still learning."

2021-03-23 02:52:59,stocks,"Oatly IPO date? Anyone have an update on Oatly IPO date and valuation? Have been a fan for years patiently waiting until I can invest. 

From Yahoo. March 2nd - Sweden-based Havre Global said Feb. 24 that it will list its stock. Investors waiting on the sidelines for further IPO details and confirmation of the true market size for milk substitutes may have had their questions answered.

Starbucks confirmed Monday that all of its stores nationwide will offer guests the option of adding Oatly's non-dairy milk substitute product as of Tuesday. The oat-based milk can be included in all of Starbucks' spring menu options.

Oatly's IPO details will likely be presented to the public in the coming weeks. The company could be seeking a $10-billion valuation in an eventual listing.
————————————————————————
Also:

 PRNewsWire included Oatly among its top oat milk brands, with other competitors in the market being Happy Planet Foods Inc., Danone (Silk), and Earth’s Own Food Company. In 2019, the global oat milk market size was $360.5 million. By 2027, that figure is projected to grow to $995.3 million. 

 One reason for oat milk’s increase in popularity is that it is often fortified with calcium and vitamin D, helping create a balanced diet for vegans and those with lactose intolerance. A greater acceptance of vegan lifestyles is also a factor. Oat-based dairy replacements have also grown in popularity because data suggest they have a lower environmental impact than some other plant-based milks, such as almond and cashew milk."
03/23/2021,stocks,Oatly for 10 billion? The world is completely crazy
03/23/2021,stocks,I wanna smoke the same shit as the guys who valued fucking Oatly at 10 billion dollars
03/23/2021,stocks,I drink oatly almost everyday so I’d probably be disappointing myself if I don’t invest. That being said how much is it worth hmmm $20 maybe lol
03/23/2021,stocks,My family drinks Oatly. They cannot keep it on the shelves at both whole foods and HEB. I am constantly buying double what I need because it sells out so fast.
03/23/2021,stocks,"Adding my 2 cents.  Having recently cut regular milk out of my diet I have to say out of various oat milk brands I've tried Oatly tastes the best and most like cow milk with Chobani being second.  Planet Oat can suck my nuts though.

I'd be willing to throw some money at their IPO since it feels like oatmilk is booming right now."
03/23/2021,stocks,"No thanks. Seems like an emerging, but cutthroat market. Oatly also tastes better because of the junk they add to it and process it more, it's less healthy than alternative oat milks. Starbucks is a big win, but unless they have disclosed the contract there is no reason to believe starbucks won't drop them in a year or two for a cheaper manufacturer that can easily replicate the blend. And afaik the only marketing boost is on the container themselves, starbucks doesn't list it as Oatly™ oatmilk on their boards/menu/marketing. Also despite the benefits of oatmilk, I don't think the market is going to be booming like it was for dairy, everyone either drank milk or they didn't, for non-dairy milk substitutes, there are like 6 different options at major grocery stores and another 3-5 brands for each option. It's an emerging but saturated market, and you also have people that simply will keep drinking dairy, so it's like everyone is a customer."
03/23/2021,stocks,Wow no cow
03/23/2021,stocks,"My partner and I go through at least 2 cartons of it a week, and we have to be at the store the day they’re stocked to find any. They sell out insanely fast. It might have stuff in it that’s not great for you, but still healthier than cow’s milk IMO.

And their packaging is so much fun. I would totally invest."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Valuation aside, oatly has the highest sugar content of all the oat milk brands at my local store. If you drink it a lot, consider switching to another brand. I switched and am very happy. I won't advertise for the brand I go with, but after a brief period adjusting to the new flavor, I honestly prefer it over oatly."
03/23/2021,stocks,I really like their product but that valuation - holy moly.

03/23/2021,stocks,"Or was it the dairy industry falsifying milk benefits and doing false advertising? 

Dairy is not exactly good for you and you don’t need milk or dairy products in a healthy diet.

Personally I think weaning off low rates had to be done at some point. Leaving them that low gives the Fed less tools to rescue the economy in the future and it kills savings. Better to bite the bullet now. It was impossible to sustain forever and creates way too much imbalance. 

Also, people still are not understanding that 2020-2021 rates were THE LOWEST RATES EVER.

So basically we are going from the lowest rates ever to the closest to lowest rates ever.

Fed is NOT going to let inflation get out of control, they just don't want to be subservient to a bunch of lame azz bond traders who keep throwing tantrums.

Also these doom and gloom scenarios get thrown out there to sway the masses. For short term traders, it's helpful to see what the establishment is trying to move in the short term and go with the flow, but for long term funds, you're never going to be able to time it correctly."
03/23/2021,stocks,"The rise in yield not only give investors an alternative to stocks, but also raises capital cost for companies (ie cost more to borrow), therefore it's terrible for growth companies that reply on borrowing to grow. 

The bond market is dynamic, in the long run, the yield will obviously rise. In the short run though, the yield may experience a pullback and this may trigger another tech run.

You see, fed signaled no rate increase til 2024, even with our fast economic recovery. But the bond vililantes (yes that's an actual term, go look it up) protested by selling bonds and FORCED the yield to rise. They protested because when economy recovers, you are supposed to signal increase in rates (Econ 101). But fed didn't do that. However, as the yield rise, many bonds investors, such as the Japanese gov, will jump in and buy the bonds, which will lower the yield. 

Fed can also jump in and buy bonds but it may not work because in order to buy bonds they have to print even more money, which is obviously inflationary (ie, fed losing control of the bond market). Nasty stuff.

In other words, we are in unchartered territory and its kind of scary. You just don't know. But in the short run, tech (especially high tech - FB barely has any debt) should have another run. Enjoy the ride."

2021-03-23 01:44:23,stocks,"(NAPA) Duckhorn Portfolio DD (NAPA) Duckhorn Portfolio Inc DD

Krispy303’s DD

I found this company last week and wanted to inquire into what it was all about. This is my DD on NAPA and I am not a financial advisor, nor do I press trade for you. I hope you enjoy!

**The Company**

NAPA became publicly tradeable last week on March 18th, 2021 at a share price of $15. They issued 20 million shares, with 13.3 million shares offered by NAPA and 6.6 million shares offered by its existing stockholders.

NAPA’s business model is a luxury wine production company with 8 massive vineyards that are the backbone of the model. Their mission is to have Duckhorn Portfolio wines poured and enjoyed wherever fine wines are served throughout the world. They have existed for over 40 years and they have had over 40 successful harvests in the Napa Valley. Today, The Duckhorn Portfolio is one of North America’s premier luxury wine companies, with ten renowned wine brands, eight state-of-the-art wineries, 843 coveted acres spanning 22 sustainably farmed Estate vineyards, over 400 diverse and talented employees, passionate consumers in every state and more than 50 countries and over 55,000 loyal wine club members who eagerly await each new shipment of our wines.

**Company Statements**

We sell our wines in all 50 states and over 50 countries at suggested retail prices (“SRPs”) ranging from $20 to $200 per bottle under a world-class luxury portfolio of brands, including Duckhorn Vineyards, Decoy, Kosta Browne, Goldeneye, Paraduxx, Calera, Migration, Canvasback, Greenwing and Postmark. We are the largest pure-play luxury wine supplier and the eleventh largest wine supplier by sales value overall in the United States according to IRI for the twelve months ended October 4, 2020.

Our wines have consistently commanded leading market positions in their respective categories and are appealing to a broad consumer base from renowned wine critics to casual wine drinkers. We are the only wine producer this century to have two brands in its portfolio that have won the prestigious Wine of the Year award from *Wine Spectator* magazine, and we also boast the number one selling luxury cabernet sauvignon in the United States since 2017 according to sales value data from IRI. Another testament to our portfolio strength is the nearly 100,000 consumers who traveled to at least one of our seven renowned tasting rooms located throughout California and Washington for one of our luxury wine experiences in 2019.

**Nitty Gritty Analysis**

1. Market Cap, NAPA has a 2.23B market cap which is calculated by share price X # of outstanding shares. This places NAPA in a mid-cap company which are typically expected to experience rapid growth. Usually, mid-cap companies are in the process of seeking funding and expanding. This entails a higher risk for any investor because they are not established like a large-cap company, but I am attracted to this stock for the potential growth.
2. Revenue, NAPA is an emerging growth company, and they are only required to present two years of financial statements and two years of related analysis. Here are some highlights of their financial success, 500% net sales growth since 2010, 18% net sales 5-year CAGR (compound annual growth rate), #1 largest pure play U.S. luxury wine company, 11 years of consecutive organic growth, 9% average net income margin, and \~40% average adjusted EBITDA margin.

The P/S ratio for NAPA currently is 0.4259 which is calculated by dividing the number of outstanding shares 115.05M by their sales last year of $270.6M. The operating margin is another good sign. They have been maintaining about 24% operating margin the past two years. Operating margin is calculated by operating income divided by total revenue.

📷

$153.2 million increase in net sales from Fiscal 2015 to Fiscal 2020, representing an approximately 18% CAGR.

$22.8 million increase in net income from Fiscal 2015 to Fiscal 2020, representing an approximately 28% CAGR.

$56.7 million increase in adjusted EBITDA from Fiscal 2015 to Fiscal 2020, representing an approximately 17% CAGR.

Highly attractive adjusted EBITDA margin profile, averaging approximately 40% between Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2020.

EBITDA margin is at calculated by taking EBITDA of divided by total revenue and it showcases the company’s financial performance. Sitting around 40% isn’t the most attractive for a stock but since this is a wine stock and they own vineyards it is common to see in farms high depreciation, interests, tax, and amortization.

**Competitors**

It is hard to say how NAPA will place in this market since they are the largest luxury wine seller in the U.S. but comparing it to the wine market, big names like STZ-B Constellation B go for $245.00 a share. I am not going to divulge into too much of the competition you can do some research on that if you want to.

**Management**

The president, Alex Ryan has maintained his position since 2005 and has taken on other roles including CEO, COBD and he was GM and COO before becoming president. Most of the executive board has been in the company pre-2010. The founders Dan and Margaret Duckhorn are no longer apart of the board, but they look like such lovely old couple that just melts your heart. They have created a successful business that now is publicly traded.

Letter from Alex Ryan CEO,

“Understanding the evolution of The Duckhorn Portfolio, and the values that have guided us for over 40 years, begins with the vision of our founders, Dan and Margaret Duckhorn. When they established Duckhorn Vineyards in 1976, we were one of just 40 wineries in Napa Valley. Even in those early days, the Duckhorns sought to set themselves apart from the pack. Recognizing that the American palate was developing, they championed Napa Valley Merlot as a standalone varietal wine. It was a bold, daring choice, and one that ultimately established luxury Merlot as one of North America’s favorite wines.

Even then, in the infancy of our industry, we intuited that American wine had the potential to become part of the fabric of consumers’ lives; that wine is more than just what is in the bottle, it is the promise of an experience, and a source of joyful connection to nature and to each other. Understanding this, the Duckhorns cultivated a commitment to excellence that shapes every facet of our business, from how we sustainably grow grapes and make wine to our commitment to holistically support our employees, engage our guests and enrich the communities in which we live and much more.

A willingness to challenge ourselves, to be daring and innovative and to never rest on past accomplishments is hardwired into our DNA. For 32 years, I have endeavored to create a diverse and inclusive culture that attracts and inspires the most talented people in our industry, and then empowers them to change our Company for the better, which has fueled growth from our debut 1978 vintage of 1,600 cases of wine sold in 1981 to more than 1.4 million cases of wine sold in Fiscal 2020.

Perhaps our greatest point of pride is the fact that as we have grown, we believe our wines and team have only gotten better. As a testament to the pedigree of our acclaimed brands, not only are we the largest and one of the most respected pure-play luxury wine companies in the United States, we are the only wine producer this century to have two brands in its portfolio that have won the prestigious “Wine of the Year” award from *Wine Spectator* magazine.”

**Risks**

COVID-19 has not seemed to really impact NAPA as greatly as they expected. They achieved just under their goal of 320 million in sales last year. Their actual sales were 277 million which with COVID being a factor and all 7 vineyards shut down to the public. 43 million is not too far off from the anticipated mark. I believe if their vineyards were open, they could have made that 43 million.

Natural disasters last year were a huge testament to what natural disasters can do. The wildfires in California were massive and although no farm of NAPA was burnt, they could still affect the grapes and how they grow. We will not see how this impact is until later this year during harvest season.

This is an emerging stock and was just listed on the market. I do not think it has quite placed itself on the market and could be volatile over the next couple weeks. Due to this factor, I have multiple buy in points planned out over the next couple weeks. I want to watch were it places first.

**Expectations**

I am a new investor of only a year, and this is my first in depth DD so sorry if this is not the best. I do expect NAPA to do very well looking at the financial statements, sec reports, their website, business model, and I just like the stock. In this market it is harder to go off of older style DD but I truly believe this is the way when valuing a new stock on the market. I expect a big catalyst for this stock is when they can open the vineyards back to the public when COVID starts dying down. They are not just producing a product and selling it they also are a service industry for travel and tourism. Bottom line is that I will be investing into this company and I’ll even try some of the wine soon.

2021-03-23 01:35:31,stocks,"Very basic options question I’ve been watching so many videos and I get the basics of call vs put. The videos just all seem the same.

Here is my very simple questions:

Buy a call for a strike price of $28. Expires 3/26
Before 3/26 the price skyrockets to $40. Knowing that it probably won’t continue, do you exercise the call or do you sell the call before expiration? Or do you wait for expiration knowing that the price will drop?

Please help!

Thanks"
03/23/2021,stocks,"Most time the premium will make it a no brainer. If you had calls a 28 and the price went to 40 you'd likely have a very easy decision to make. UNLESS you really wanted the stock. If that was the case then exercise the option. 

But I really think it will be an easy decision. You also need to keep in mind that upward volatility could just as easily mean downward volatility. Get your premium and get out."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Sell.

Sell now and sell the $12 ITM plus the extrinsic value. Let someone else risk the price going back down.

If you really like the stock, find the price where it settles and buy with profits from the options sale. Or if you want to get fancy sell a put at the price you'd be willing to buy back in.

03/23/2021,stocks,You shouldn’t really ever exercise an option for the most part
03/23/2021,stocks,"You would gain more by selling the option because owning stocks has no extrinsic value. You give up extrinsic value when your exercise the option and lose that money.

You give up more the further from expiration you are, and the more implied volatility may have went up since you bought it."
03/23/2021,stocks,At expiration a long call will be assigned and you buy 100 shares at the strike price. If a short call it will be exercised and you will be required to purchase 100 at market and sell them at the strike price.
03/23/2021,stocks,"There is a chance you don't get filled right away when you out a limit order. But you should always put a limit order for options because the volume isn't always there to make a really tight bid-ask spread. 

This means a market order price could be a lot further from the mid price it displays you than you would expect, losing you money.

Even if you are happy with the current bid-ask prices, it's best to use limit orders with those values."
2021-03-23 01:31:22,stocks,"I think im experiencing FOMO. Can I get your guys' opinion on my thought process? Hi all!

I'm a 19 year old who has had his money in the market for around 2 years now.

Recently, as I've been finding out more and more about my passions, I've decided to major in an area in business, most likely finance or accounting. Because of this I've been learning more and more about investing and about the economy as a whole. I'm a big believer in the investing philosophies of people such as Munger, Buffet, and Lynch (but I'm also learning more about other famous investors).

One of the biggest lessons I've been discovering is that I don't know jack shit about investing and business. After reading Beating the Street by Peter Lynch, I've been thinking about my own investments and realized that I don't know near enough to support my individual stock purchases.

Last week, I made the decision to sell all my shares in all the companies I own, roughly 15,000$ on the basis that I need to learn much more before I can justify making intelligent stock purchases. I had shares in relatively riskier equities such as WFC, CCL, CHWY, and IPOE.

I think my decision to make that choice was a good idea, because the future of all these companies are pretty uncertain for one reason or another, and so I should be very well educated about the industries and business models of these companies to justify owning shares in them.

Another thing I've learned is that it's always better to invest than to let your cash sit around and do nothing. Therefore, I was considering the following investment strategy until I feel educated enough to make smart investments:

25-40% SPY

25-40% VOO

20%-50% 3-5 well known respectable blue chips stocks such as (JPM,COST,JNJ,DIS).

SPY and VOO are obviously extremely diversified and are great for less knowledgeable investors because they follow the market. Blue chip stocks are much less volatile that my previous holdings and many investors consider them safe but with positive future outlook.

Is this a decent idea? Or am I facing FOMO and wanting to have money invested to not miss out on a possible bull market in 2021? I've actually had great returns over the past year, but I know that it's easy to make money in a bull market. I don't want to be naïve and continue to invest without having strong reasoning or financial education. Thanks for reading and all input and advice will be appreciated."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Just sayin' OP, I don't think you know what ""risky"" is. 
Risky is buying shares of an Asian airline for $0.031 with no relevant news articles, and the only website is in a foreign language, and you don't know why the stock is flat for 1 year and then just started having some 100% gains in the last 2 days. 

Yeah, I'm into risky deals."
03/23/2021,stocks,"People our age are yoloing in GME, you have a conservative strategy judging from your choices. Do it now, make some mistakes, and learn from it. I'm so glad I made some mistakes now instead of later on when I would have more money to invest/lose lol"
03/23/2021,stocks,Switch from SPY and VOO to SPX LEAPS. no more fomo
03/23/2021,stocks,🤣🤣🤣
03/23/2021,stocks,"Sounds like a great strategy. Don't forget about taxes on your recent sells.

03/23/2021,stocks,"You're being very conservative. What options are you considering? Savings account? It's very simple, read up on the companies that you're interested in. Read up on their annual reports, news and the market they operate in.

When I started off in my twenties, I went heavy into biotech, not knowing much about the industry. Lost thousands and thought about never investing again. Fast forward, still a heavy weight in Biotech startups, but now I know the workings of the industry and I read up on every company and how they plan to penetrate the market with their technology.

Morale of the story, be prepared that you MAY lose and you will have to learn to lose. Winning tastes so much better when you win because of something you took the time to investigate and learn."

That's also an important strategy to consider. Do you wish to ride the wave and trade, or are you investing in a company? Big difference. Nothing wrong with short-term profits, but short-term trading is statistically less lucrative. Best of luck!"
03/23/2021,stocks,"Haha!  Did you just compare yourself to some of the greatest investors of all time?  “If they do it why shouldn’t I?”  Simply because you are not them.

03/23/2021,stocks,"Sometimes that is a glitch, sometimes that is an order that is canceled, sometimes it's algorithms.

E.g., a computer may sell and then buy the stock to itself (or it's buddies) in a nanosecond. There is a lot of wonky shit that happens with FTD's, AI, etc. It might put in an order then immediately cancel it to ""probe"" the market or for some other trick. 

Remember though, it isn't the volume that changes the price. The price is changed based on supply and demand, what people are willing to pay.

So if the price is 3$ and you are willing to buy it then it's just an exchange of the stock for 3$. Volume increased BUT the price hasn't. But if you are only willing to buy for 2.99$ then something has to give. Either you have to go up(the price increases) or the seller has to come down(the price decreases).

Volume really has nothing to do with it except it sorta measures how often this ""bargaining"" is occurring(not telling you in which direction, that is the price).

The price can change drastically with just one share. If, say, you will only pay 1$ and the seller comes down to 1$ then the price dropped 2$! Even with just one share. Of course it really depends on what every one else is doing. If no one else will sell at 1$ then it will rise back up.

You can think of the stock price as the price at which people, on average, are agreeing to buying and selling the stock. When there is a disagreement the price changes but it depends on all the buyers and sellers as a collective. You can go sell a 100$ stock for 1$ and it will be bought up real quick, you will lose 99$, it won't change the price much because no one else is going sell it that cheap. Now if you sell a large number of stock(e.g., naked shorting) you can drive the price down because now there is plenty of supply to provide to people.

So, also you have to take in to account supply and demand. But it's very complex because you have all the traders with their different ideas of what it they are doing. The stock price is the ""average"" overall price at whcih all this takes place. It doesn't mean it is the correct price and it doesn't' mean it can't be manipulated or weird stuff can happen. It simply means that this is the price at which pretty much everyone is working off of more or less, at least in theory.

As an individual all you can really do is figure out what you think the stock is worth buying or selling for and buy or sell it at that price. This is why fundamentals are so important, this is what tries to help you understand the market rather than just flip a coin. You can get lucky, sure, but you can also get unlucky.

I don't think it is all that important to know why the stock price is what it is, because the reasons are myriad and too complex(it is good to have some idea but not critical). What is more important is to figure out what the stock is going to do(predict the future). This is suppose to have to do with how well a company does or other factors... it doesn't' always, sometimes it's just purely manipulated and you will be burned by corrupt billionaires. Some companies are purely used to manipulate stock and take peoples money. Bots can be used to drive and up a price to make it different than what it technically should be to give a certain impression. It's all a game, a very flawed game.

Basically you can't predict from the stock price and volume much of anything. In one moment volume could be high and the next it could be nothing(usually there is a little bit of continuity).  You can get a feel for certain events like rallies and dips and all that to some degree but no matter how good you are at predicting you will always fail too. If you have fundamental understanding of why something is taking place then you have context and can make a better estimate of what might happen next. E.g., if an IPO just started you know that hype is going to drive the price higher and then the institutional investors will sell to profit. Pretty much every IPO works this way. It's a way to fleece people that don't understand. Of course if the corp actually wants to do it's think it can work to reward those investors by making profit. A lot of times though it's just a scam where the IPO was specifically created to take money then fail(just another pump and dump).

I don't know what all the spikes are, but clearly they are not legitimate if someone is offering to sell or buy a huge number of shares and it immediately is traded with no change. I would imagine almost all of them are computers doing the trading with other accounts to shift around stock. E.g., they know they can make a trade at time X, they box it just right, and have their other account buy it at time X+0.000000000001. (possibly they do this internally so there is no risk). It's reported that a huge trade went through, and it did, but it was just ""book keeping"". Maybe on their side they have a ""macro"" that makes it all happen but on our side we see the spike and it looks spurious. It could be, in some cases, a glitch such as one wanting to sell 10 share but the 0 gets stuck and one sells 100000000000 shares and the order is immediately canceled by someone upstream."

2021-03-23 00:55:14,stocks,"New, Stupid, and Trying to make Sense of Everything So I got a major income hike last year and decided to celebrate my first paycheck at the new salary with a baby investment of $200. That was around September. I'm sitting at $325 now, so I feel like for being a noob with no idea what I'm doing that I have been doing pretty okay so far. I've just been running off what seems like common sense so far, but I want to actually know what I am doing a little better.

It's rough though. I don't want to trust major websites because they lie about so much else. I've started lurking some of the stock related subs here, but everything is so loaded with jargon no one explains that it feels like I'm trying to read a foreign language. Even the rare 'beginners' post I manage to come across every blue moon is nigh incomprehensible.

I don't want to invest any more than I have in stocks now until I'm more knowledgeable. The initial $200 was a crazy whim that's been working so far, but a gamble is a gamble and you don't play big if you don't know the strategies inside and out. At this point even a general overview of those is an improvement over the common sense ""sell high, buy low, diversify"" I came in with.

Can anyone point me in the right direction for trustworthy info given in layman's terms? Is there a lexicon or something with the definitions for all the acronyms and terminology someone can link me to? Should I just take my gains thus far and back out until I actually know what I'm doing?"

I funded two Roth IRAs by selling 12k worth of my company stock that I will forget about. I felt very lost and overwhelmed so I threw myself into study by Googling, watching YouTube, TiK Tok, listening to podcasts (there are a few for beginners specifically) and I listened to “The Great Courses - How The Stock Market Works”. I did some research. Some of the links I used are in the introduction paragraph for this subreddit.

2021-03-23 00:53:50,stocks,"A Bull Case DD: $NGMS NeoGames the $DKNG of iLottery  

So I've been waiting to share this DD on $NGMS until it hit a 1B market cap. Which, it did so today.

First, I know iLottery feels like such a boomer idea, but let's face it. We've all bought a powerball, played mega millions, scratched some $2 stocking stuffers at Christmas, played a little Keno at the bar, etc. This industry is essentially what the online sport gambling industry was 2-3 years ago. In my opinion this stock could make me super rich. Why, because $NGMS is the pure play here!

**Who is NeoGames ($NGMS)?**

NeoGames is a technology-driven innovator and a global provider of iLottery solutions for national and state-regulated lotteries. Their full-service solution combines proprietary technology platforms with the experience and expertise required for successful iLottery operations.

**Some DD**

iLottery in 2020 was 2.7% of the total US lottery market. In 2 quarters, Va's iLottery went from 0% to 25%. Michigan's iLottery market share has grown to 40% of total lottery sales. In Europe, iLottery is 25-50+% of the total lottery market depending on the country. In 10 years, when the total U.S. lottery market is 120B, iLottery could be 50% assuming all states are online. $NGMS is in a joint venture with Pollard Banknote under the name of NPI (Pollard is a big player in the lottery printing business). NPI's cut of ilottery is 15%. Neo's cut is 7.5%. 7.5% of 60B is 4.5B. Profit margin is roughly 40%, or 1.8B and $70/sh. Put a 15X multiple on it, and you have a $1,000 stock. It currently trades at around $40/sh today at a 1B cap. And iLottery could reach 50% sooner than 10 years if Va's experience is any indication.

$NGMS is currently contracted with 50% of the states that allow iLottery; and has 70% of the market share (total $).

Just wait until CA, NY, FL, and TX join the party. NY just legalized online sports gambling, and unless they want to lose market share, they'll put the lottery online, too. Online sports gambling provides a MUCH lesser cut for the government. Lottery is a HUGE revenue driver for state governments, so they will not sit idle on iLottery for long once online sports gambling is legal.

Here is the kicker. $NGMS is also teasing getting into online sports gambling. My valuation on them is purely based on iLottery potential. If they were to get into sports gambling, look out... their technology is incredible and they could add a some serious disruption to that market as well. They are also an international business... I only included the upside from the US market alone. They have also gained contracts with entire European countries in recent weeks.

Do your own DD I am an idiot. Good Luck to all."

2021-03-23 00:32:43,stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, March 22, 2021 Stocks rose on Monday, following a volatile week, with technology stocks leading the pack looking to reclaim lost ground. After leading the market higher in 2020, tech stocks have largely been under pressure following a sharp rise in Treasury yields. Banks, industrials, and other reopening stock underperformed, giving back some recent gains, but looking ahead, we expect the rotation out of tech stocks and into cyclical and reopening stocks to continue as the economy continues to gradually open back up.

After jumping to one-year highs last week, the 10 year Treasury yield retreated to hover slightly below 1.7% (1.68% at the time of writing). The sharp contrast between the performance of the Dow and the Nasdaq in recent weeks underscores the increasing rotation out of high-flying tech stocks that led the markets higher last year and into stocks that are poised to directly benefit from economic reopening. The energy and financials sectors have also been leading gains in the S&P 500, outperforming tech and growth stocks in 2021. Rising Treasury yields hurt high-growth stocks the most because these companies require a lot of capital to fund their growth and expansion and generate most of their cash and earnings years down the road. Future cash decreases in today's dollars as rates increase partly because investors have more opportunity to earn bigger returns from assets paying higher interest and dividends right now. Higher yields make it more expensive to borrow capital. It’s important to remember that despite rising yields, the benchmark 10-year yield remains at historic lows, roughly half what it was five years ago. 

Last week, The Federal Reserve reiterated its commitment to maintaining interest rates near zero and asset purchase program at a pace of $120 billion per month in place for the foreseeable future, even as the US economy shows signs of gaining momentum thanks to an increase in the pace of vaccination and the recently passed stimulus package. FOMC members now expect the unemployment rate to dip to 4.5% by the end of this year with an inflation rate of 2.4%. Three months earlier, the Fed expected an unemployment rate to improve to only 5.0% with core personal consumption expenditures rising by just 1.8% by year-end. Real GDP growth will likely come in at 6.5% this year, the Fed projected, up sharply from its previous 4.2% growth forecast. 

Steve Sosnick, chief strategist of at Interactive Brokers said of the Fed’s comments, “Chairman Powell was pretty adamant, as he had been in front of Congress as well, that he was not really inclined to do anything preemptive about inflation, but react to it if inflation becomes a problem if we’re at full employment. We’re a long way off from that, but the bond market now is getting nervous that we could see inflation becoming a problem before the Fed does anything about it. And that’s the little bit of a freak out that we had been seeing in bonds.”

2021-03-23 00:25:46,stocks,"Advice on IPO price-taker participation with Questrade broker I am the employee of a Canadian company which is about to go public. I was informed by corporate that I would have the opportunity to participate in the IPO as a price-taker for the initial offering. This participation involves providing my employer with information about my broker (Questrade) - basically just my account number and my broker's name. It was also made clear to me that I had to have the money in my Questrade investment account for the transaction to take place. But, based on the limited information I had to provide about my broker, I don't really see how the process is supposed to work without me also doing a bunch of coordination with Questrade. Otherwise, how could Questrade know that \_I\_ wanted the transaction to go through for the IPO purchase, since I didn't explicitly tell \_them\_ - I only told my company?  

Does anyone know if there is a Questrade form I need to fill out, or will things simply ""work"" if I make sure the money is in my account and I just leave it?"
03/23/2021,stocks,For your reference: corporate was able to answer this for me.  The deadline is imposed by them so they have time to contact my broker and sort out the affair with them.  I don’t need to do anything but fill out the form my employer provided originally.

Even easier, I've been taking a quick look at a company's website. I've been bitten twice now by stocks with companies who couldn't bother to get an SSL certificate for their site to make it secure/https. It's such an easy thing to do, and Google started pushing for it years ago.

I would be embarrassed if my websites weren't https. Seems like these companies would want to put their best foot forward?

There is little pressure for rural voters to vote with legalization in mind because marijuana is pretty much already legal if you are white.  

I live in a rural town and if you're a good ol' boy and the local cops catch you with weed, they just confiscate it and ""let you off with a warning"".  Rural jobs won't drug test for weed so there is no worry of losing your job if you smoke it.

Hello everyone, I have managed retirement funds, but I have personally never purchased or sold a stock. I have about $3500 to play around with and thought I might enjoy doing some trading in my free time. I've spent the last few weeks looking at a variety of different stocks and have honed into Scholastic (SCHL) as a potential buy. I have no idea what I'm doing, but I am curious about your thoughts.

Both my wife and I are teachers and so we've been thinking about companies that have suffered during COVID that may rebound with the return of in-person learning. Many of those companies are already at, or approaching 5-year highs, and so I see no value in those particular stocks. However, Scholastic is currently trading around $29 which appears to be near 1-year highs, but still far from pre COVID averages. I'm thinking it will level out around $38 in the next year, and perhaps reach highs of $45.

That being said, I'm simply looking at historic charts. I've done very little DD and I haven't found much info in the news. The little I've seen says to sell. But why? Many of the school-based stocks seem to be recovering rapidly, why wouldn't Scholastic? What do you all know that I am failing to understand?

I do not have any positions in SCHL."
03/23/2021,stocks,"COVID is not their problem. Revenue has been flat for more than five years before COVID, and they make very little profit on the revenue. Additionally, the COVID disruption has forced many school systems to try online library subscriptions and reading apps. Does SCHL have any piece of that or will it be something that bleeds market share from them? I just don’t see any potential."
03/23/2021,stocks,Good points. I'll look into it. Thanks for your thoughts.

He is in charge of a stock competition where you have to pick a stock and do a 10 minute pitch on it, so I formed a team and entered. There are independent judges, so the only thing he will be able to do is hand the winning team the award, and I would like to win to see the look on his face.

Here's the issue: I've never traded stocks in my life. I'm a fucking pre-law major and so are most of my teammates. We're smart and good with debate and arguing, but I barely know what the NASDAQ is much less have any ability to pick a stock from thin air. Do you guys have any advice on where and how to start?

03/23/2021,stocks,"But I'm not really considering whether I can afford something. I can afford way way more than I ever buy since I'm saving half my salary.  What I'm doing is considering the utility of my purchase. 

Sitting down and saying I'm going to buy spend $x on groceries each month is too limiting in my opinion. I know how much I spend on groceries each month right now because I shop exclusively through whole foods delivery, but before that, I'd go around to various stores buying what I wanted based on what was on sale and how much I value a particular item. I'm really looking forward to getting back out there. It's still way faster than trying to find stuff with Amazon's broken search. 

I think there is also a tendency to spend to a limit when you have a budget. This is what I can spend, so I do. I never think like that. I buy what I want based on what seems a reasonable forward price ie would I really want to pay 8x this price for this item in 25 years? Well yes, my son needs diapers and he gets rashes from the crappy kind, so I'm buying these nice diapers today. I don't really think much about essentials and food since they are such small parts of ny spending (we in the US spend so much less on food than other countries), but thinking about the future cost of items has really cut down on spending on things I can afford but don't need."
2021-03-22 22:37:04,stocks,"ELI5: Increased margin requirements for leveraged ETFs I'm interested in potentially investing in leveraged ETFs (2x, 3x, reverse etc.).  My broker, TD Ameritrade has some warning messages that pop up every time I look at these.  I was wondering if someone could explain this to me in a more simple way.  I lack the context to understand it.  Here is what TD has on their site:  
 All leveraged ETFs will be set to a margin requirement equal to 2X or 3X the TD Ameritrade base maintenance requirement of 30% (not to exceed 100%).

* 2X = 60%
* 3X = 90%"
03/23/2021,stocks,"If you're not utilizing margin, then you don't need to worry about it. But to explain what it means...

Margin requirement is the proportion of the security value that can be purchased and/or must be maintained over time using your own margin equity (meaning cash or security value). If you have $1000 in cash, then you can purchase up to $1250 of an 80% margin requirement ETF. $1000 (80% of $1250) of it is purchased with your funds and $250 on a margin loan. If the ETF decreases in value then you could face a margin call because your ownership proportion would be <80% the maintenance margin requirement."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Can you elaborate?

Say an ETF has been around for 10+ years and has, on average, a 10%+ yearly return.

Say margin rates are variable, sure, but are 8% currently.

Going on margin and adding the ETF should net positive 2%+, no? It’s not much, but it’s better than nothing."
03/23/2021,stocks,Excellent explanation.  Thank you.
03/23/2021,stocks,"That’s assuming perfect outcomes where you still get 10% return, and no volatility-induced margin calls though. If the market has a -10% week as it did a few weeks ago you’ll have forced sales at losses. Overall it’s just not worth that headache.  If you really want to leverage it’s better to borrow money from a third party lender and then throw it in your account."

Right now I'm 50% VOO and 50% VOOG.  But I'm wondering what if I just went all VOOG!

But then I want to ask if you see if there is anything else one should consider? Also I want to make sure the bot doesn't auto remove this thread so I better keep typing!  Oh the bot is a pain?

2021-03-22 22:31:59,stocks,"Best stocks for the fourth industrial revolution The Fourth Industrial Revolution is characterised by the fusion of the digital, biological, and physical worlds, as well as the growing utilisation of new technologies. It is the trend towards automation and data exchange in manufacturing technologies and processes which include:

* Cyber-physical systems (CPS) / Cyber security
* Cloud Computing
* Ai
* Advanced Robotics / automation
* Big-data
* 3D printing
* Quantum computing (hypothetically)
* Robotic process automation (RPA)

Of course there's discussions which one are part of the industry 4.0 so I might be missing a few.

since I believe that we are still at the start of this revolution, I want to invest in promising companies related to those industries. Some companies already have proven themselves, others are still in the 'startup' fase.

**Hereby a list of the companies from which I think are the best or will be the best in the corresponding sector. What sectors and which must-have companies am I missing?**

**Note:** some sectors are very broad so they might overlap.

&#x200B;

* **Cyber-physical systems (CPS) / Cyber security**
   * **CrowdStrike - $CRWD**
      * Offers a broad spectrum of solutions with the main goal of cyber-security. Some well-known clients where they have solved hacks are Sony Pictures and the DNC (Democratic National Committee). The company is the market leader in the cloud-based endpoint security segment and is also expanding into 5G network security.
   * **Cloudflare - $NET**
      * Offers a wide range of network services to companies around the world. Cloudflare's intelligent global network spans more than 200 cities in more than 100 countries. It provides network security and improved network performance and reliability to an increasing proportion of the total Internet used. More than 15% of the internet is used via Cloudflare
   * **BlackBerry - $BB**
      * They are working on AI powered cybersecurity
      * They also work on QNX. QNX is a real-time embedded OS that controls software systems in (modern, especially EV) cars and forms the basis of solutions such as BlackBerry Radar, an IoT based asset tracking system for the transport sector.
      * Spark Suites: Spark provides visibility and protection for all endpoints, including personal laptops and smartphones used for work. It uses AI, machine learning, and automation to provide better cyberattack prevention.

&#x200B;

* **Cloud Computing**
   * I'll include Amazon and Microsoft since they deserve a spot in this list. But as @[ArtakhaPrime](https://www.reddit.com/user/ArtakhaPrime/) mentioned: Amazon and Microsoft ""are already some of the biggest in the world and make all sorts of stuff. It's entirely possible their innovations will be integral to aspects of the 4th Industrial Revolution, but it may also only be a relative drop or glass in the larger bucket that they currently represent.""
   * **Amazon - $AMZN**
   * **Microsoft - $MSFT**
   * **Cloudflare - $NET - See DD in previous category**
   * **Fastly - $FSLY - Need DD**
   * **Digital Ocean - $DOCN - Need DD**
   * **DataDog - $DDOG - Need DD**

&#x200B;

* **Ai**
   * **C3Ai - $AI - Need DD**
   * **Nvidia - NVDA - Need DD**
   * **Intel - INTC - Need DD**

&#x200B;

* **Advanced Robotics / automation**
   * **Teradyne - $TER**
      * Focusses on industrial automation, semiconductor testing, wireless testing and storage testing. Customers are Samsung, Qualcomm, Intel, Analog Devices, Texas Instruments and IBM. **Some of their business units are:**
      * The System Test Group: they build test machines for printed circuit boards and hard drives
      * LifePoint: test machines for manufacturers of wireless modules and consumer electronics.
      * Universal robots: provides collaborative robots (cobots) that work side by side with production workers. UR-cobots automate tasks such as machine loading, packaging, gluing, painting, polishing and assembling parts
      * Mobile Industrial Robots: offers autonomous mobile robots for the management of internal logistics (for loads under 1,500 kg). These robots are currently used in the transportation, healthcare, pharmaceutical, metal and plastics, fashion, technology and food industries.
      * AutoGuide Mobile Robots manufactures modular industrial mobile robots (for loads up to 45,000 kg). These high payload robots are used for assembly, material handling, storage and distribution across multiple industries.
   * **Cyberdyne - $CYBQY - Need DD**
   * **ABB - $ABB - Need DD**

&#x200B;

* **Big-data**
   * **Palantir - $PLTR**
      * This is the way
   * **SalesForce - $CRM**
      * Big data CRM (big data customer relationship management) refers to the practice of integrating big data into a company's CRM processes with the goals of improving customer service, calculating return on investment on various initiatives and predicting clientele behavior.
      * Salesforce is the leader in the CRM sector. Recently, Salesforce has acquired the big data firm “Tableau” for $15.3 billion and Slack for $27.7 billion, adding muscle in its fight with some major leaders. Moreover, the integration of Salesforce CRM and Big Data will enable businesses in analyzing customer patterns and preferences.
   * **SnowFlake -$SNOW - Need DD**

&#x200B;

* **3D Printing**
   * **Desktop Metal - $DM**
      * Co-founders are MIT alumnus Ric Fulop and 4 other MIT professors.
      * They have a new patent called ""single pass jetting"". It takes most 3D printing machines several times to print one layer, Desktop Metal can do it in one go. This makes them by far the fastest in the entire industry (up to 4x faster) - Speed ​​means lower costs, what DM printers can do in 1 day, takes other printers 3-4x that time.
      * They have secured a global distribution network of more than 80 partners in 60 countries offering their Live Parts software as SaaS. Live Parts is an AI software that allows users to automatically generate printable object designs. The program allows users to enter specifications for an object and then create a computer model that can be printed. As a result, they are assured of huge income in addition to their hardware
      * Today, Desktop Metal announced that it launched Desktop Health, a line specifically devoted to healthcare-adjacent products. The line encompasses a number of different technologies, including binder jetting, bioprinting and various materials.
   * **Nano Dimension - DD is from their website**
      * Nano Dimension’s DragonFly System is a one-stop solution for agile hardware development and innovative circuit design across a wide array of industries. It empowers companies to securely control entire development cycles through in-house additive manufacturing of PCBs and non-planar electronics with speed and precision, while reducing R&D costs. With it’s Lights-Out Digital Manufacturing (LDM) printing technology, this is the industry’s only comprehensive manufacturing printing platform for round-the-clock 3D printing of electronic circuitry.
   * **Markforged - $AONE - Need DD**

&#x200B;

* **Quantum Computing**
   * **IonQ - $DMYI**
      * A quick introduction to QC: a normal computer exists of bytes, so 0 OR 1, a QC has qubits, so possibly 0 AND 1 at the same time. In theory this will improve the computational power of computers in a massive way and therefore QC wil be able to solve different classes of problems
      * The qubits that make up QCs are prone to error given the fragile nature of the quantum states. There are 2 quantum states: ion trap (IonQ, Honeywell) and superconducting qubits (IBM, Google). These have about a 0.5% chance of an error during a so-called 2-qubit gate operation ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum\_logic\_gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic_gate)), thus limiting the complexity of the computation you will be able to do.
      * So a lot of research is being done to improve these physical error rates, but an improvement of more than 0.01% seems to be difficult.  This is where error correction becomes important. People have come up with error correction codes that can tolerate error rates and create a much lower error rate by creating what's called a logical qubit. ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical\_and\_logical\_qubits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_and_logical_qubits)).
      * It takes a lot of physical qubits to make 1 single logical qubit.  Most researchers believe that with a few hundred to a few thousand very good logic qubits you can solve very impactful problems in the world and thus create significant value.  IonQ expects to achieve this in 7 years ([https://ionq.com/posts/december-09-2020-scaling-quantum-computer-roadmap](https://ionq.com/posts/december-09-2020-scaling-quantum-computer-roadmap))

&#x200B;

* **Robotic process automation**
   * **Blue Prism - $PRSM - Need DD**
   * **UiPath - $UIPTH (IPO later this year)**

&#x200B;

* **Semi-Conductors:**
   * **ASML Holding NV (NASDAQ: ASML)** \- From u/MikeJamesBurry the most important Europe Stock. It is a Dutch company and currently the largest supplier in the world of photolithography systems for the semiconductor industry. The company manufactures machines for the production of integrated circuits. The company is the most significant component of the Euro Stoxx 50

03/23/2021,stocks,"I'm not trying to put you down, but this isn't really DD. The Nano Dimension blurb is just marketing jargon copied from a website that's trying to sell it. Many of the others indicate just a cursory knowledge/misunderstanding of what these companies are actually doing

The quantum computing section, for example, misses the point of quantum computing pretty hard (the whole ""possibly 0 AND 1 ... will improve the computational power of computers"" no, it's not about improving computational power at all, it's about being able to solve different classes of problems

BB: ""AI powered cybersecurity"" is done to death, and this doesn't comment at all on what's special about it. ""They work on QNX"" sure, tons of RTOS exist, this doesn't comment in any way on why that one is special

There's lots of descriptions and buzzwords, but next to no discussion of \*why\* these things are significant compared to competitors etc"
03/23/2021,stocks,"UiPath IPO should be huge.  I would not leave Microsoft out of this category though.  They are coming on strong, and from an investing standpoint, have so much else to offer that this only increases the potential value to be had."
03/23/2021,stocks,"My top 3 stocks for companies who actually will build the future of tech, energy and AI are $STPK $MP $TSM. I could invest 10% of my income to these every month and not lose any sleep."
03/23/2021,stocks,"While I agree with all the categories you selected here, I’m surprised by your stock picks. As someone who works in biotech it is hard to stay current on these rapidly changing industries. Fortunately there is an ARK ETF for almost everyone, so I would either pick some of the top holdings from each of those (thanks Cathie for the DD) or just buy the ETFs and forget about it for a few years. These industries are changing super fast and require some pretty specialized knowledge to really understand."

03/23/2021,stocks,"No AMD, TSMC or ASML? I know they're already pretty hot due to semiconductors but is it wrong to assume they'll stay strong?"
03/23/2021,stocks,"I'm definitely with you on this - those are all big industries that are booming or starting to and I personally invest in NET I think its grossly undervalued. But I gotta bring up AWS, Azure, and GCP.

Not sure if you excluded these because they are already some of the most well known companies in these spaces, but I thought it'd be worth bringing up Amazon, Microsoft, and Google. 

AWS is the most widely used cloud computing platform that offers DNEaaS (Damn-Near Everything as a Service). It's huge for devops, infrastructure as code, cybersecurity, governance, and compliance as well as big data, ML, and AI (the list of buzzword services offered by aws is never ending).

Microsoft Azure is not too far behind AWS in popularity with its suite of buzzword services and Google Cloud Platform is gaining big traction too. To put it simply, if any of these three players went down for just a day, you would notice. Fortunately, with the magnitude of their global infrastructures, that isnt too likely to happen.

Just my two cents, but do a little digging on the amount of users and organizations that depend on AWS and Azure and take a look at the never-ending amount of tech services they both offer."

03/23/2021,stocks,"Automation is not only robotics.  Sensoring devices and controls, for smart buildings and smart grids will need installed and programmed.  Companies like Siemens will see huge growth as contracts pour in to update facilities and start installing the IOT"
03/23/2021,stocks,"I want 3D printing to improve. It still seems like it is in its infancy stages. You can 3D print stuff, but usually its just some shitty looking plastic garbage.

I think once the tech improves we could be 3D printing useful things in our own homes. A 3D printer could become as widespread and normal as owning a microwave."

Imagine vast fleets of robots whisking materials across continents, where rail meets AI-controlled trucks that direct-ship to point of sale and you have the near future of transport.

Consider that transport employs more people than any other industry in North America and you can see how dramatically the workforce is about to irrevocably shift."

There are a ton of gaps in this analysis. 

For example, the blurb on Salesforce includes its purchase of Tableau, but misses its purchase of Slack - an equally if not more impactful acquisition. Further, it completely ignores the elephant in the room - which is that Salesforce and Microsoft are in a pitched battle in both of these spaces (data viz/analytics and unified comms) ... And right now Microsoft is winning: 

1. [Tableau v Powerbi](https://www.google.com/search?q=tableau+vs+power+bi+gartner+ratings&tbm=isch&chips=q:tableau+vs+power+bi+gartner+ratings,online_chips:2020&client=ms-android-verizon&prmd=niv&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjB1fyGu8bvAhUWHd8KHeRgDLUQ4lYoAXoECAEQBg&biw=384&bih=667#imgrc=tWDjKYmUkOVOOM)

2. [Slack v Microsoft Teams](https://www.statista.com/chart/20028/daily-active-users-of-slack-and-microsoft-teams/)

So, if you truly believe big data will be a factor in our current industrial revolution (and you should) it's hard to make the case that Salesforce is far-and-away the right horse to be betting on. And I say that as a Salesforce admin for my company!

About the evidence of an industrial revolution: (this is part of a research by deloitte)

Today relationship-changing technology is advancing at a faster rate than ever before. There is a debate on why this rate of change has increased, but the data on the rapidity of change are absolutely clear.
Four decades ago no one owned a computer. A decade ago the pocket computers we call smartphones didn’t even exist. But today just about everyone in the developed world has at least one
smartphone, if not two. Households in OECD countries with two teenagers had 10 connected devices in 2012. By 2022 this is expected to be 50. And each one of those devices has thousands of times more computing power than the Apollo 11 spacecraft.

What we are seeing today is the Fourth Industrial Revolution.
There is no single technology here. There is no single driving idea. This is the era of creative convergence, where technologies begin to connect. It is something comparable to the great evolutionary transition from single celled organisms to functioning organic networks.

Computing and communications converged to initiate the internet. Mobile networks, cheap data storage and affordable processors made it universal, creating the infrastructure for the Fourth Industrial Revolution.

Digital disruption, automation, big data – these are the forces of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Cloud computing and the imminent roll out of 5G mobile networks have only pushed harder on the accelerator. Organizations need a new vision and operating model that leverages all of these new technologies; real value can only be delivered when these technologies are used together. Operations leaders must change the way they think and direct these technologies, not be directed by them.

Many have seen this change coming. But it is turning out to be much more powerful than anyone imagined. Technology is now ubiquitous. Automation, AI and cognitive tools are enabling us to do many things very differently. Decisions, services and operations are now augmented processes. We have gone from changing the way we work, to changing the way we think."
03/23/2021,stocks,"was actually thinking about this today.

The next big industry/company is going to fill a need that consumers dont have yet.

Id think consumer centric cyber security that is focused on anonymity is what's next or the next wave of entertainment which might be VR.

other than that, most of our disposable income is tied up.

Personal computers, person vehicles, cell phones, entertainment etc.

If you look at every company that did extremely well, its companies that created a necessity item/ service/ replaced a oligopoly type of business.

question is to figure out whats next."

When investing in manufacturing, it’s important to weigh process and industrial design. This is one core element to Tesla’s success for example. It also helps you have a deeper understanding in service-oriented organizations that achieved great heights like Amazon. Technology is interesting in the sense that it allows some operational efficiency improvements

03/23/2021,stocks,I've been watching AITX. They build AI-based security hardware. The full product. I'm new to this sector but someone put me on to that company out of Reno. It's the first one I've looked at. Thanks to your post I'll be looking at more.
03/23/2021,stocks,"Please also investigate ""Microchip technology"" and ""Nordic semiconductor"" stocks."
03/23/2021,stocks,Lithium? Is the first thing that comes to mind as there was a shortage and the demand is only increasing until a new form of battery is widely used.

03/23/2021,stocks,"Power automate will compete with some of uipath’s features but it’s waaaaay behind UiPath as a full unattended automation solution.

If we are talking about true digital transformation then the majority of automation needs to be end to end with as few manual touch points as possible. That currently requires a full RPA program with a center of excellence, unattended bots that perform entire processes not just repetitive tasks.

All that to say power automate poses a threat only to UiPath’s “bot on every computer” business model. Until Microsoft can compete with UiPath for a full, robust RPA program UiPath isn’t going anywhere and will continue to dominate the market."

03/23/2021,stocks,"100%. Tensorflow is it.

EDIT - The messages about this comment are getting annoying. Yes, Tensorflow is free. Yes, that still makes Google money. Google's Cloud AI uses Tensorflow natively. Increased Tensorflow adoption means more cloud customers, and being open source means other people are pumping resources into improving it, which in turn improves Google's cloud offerings. This is to say nothing about training and support which is a large part of the value of corporate contracts."
03/23/2021,stocks,Yeah I recently took a course and if I remember correctly Amazon (AWS) was holding something like 70% of the cloud computing market share.
03/23/2021,stocks,"It’s crazy. 

A day doesn’t go by that I don’t see an AWS CDN URL come up when I open a file on some website. For Christ sake, practically the entirety of Netflix is run on AWS, which accounts for *15% of the worlds bandwidth in its own*. That’s impressive. Plus, pretty much every startup in the world is using an IaaS offering and, statistically speaking, they’re probably using AWS. Some estimates calculate that more than half of the internet relies on AWS in some way. That is equal parts terrifying and awe inspiring. 

I started tinkering with AWS in 2008. Unfortunately, at that time in my life, I didn’t give two shits about the stock market. I wish I did, because at that time, I knew good and well that AWS was going to be a massive business and if I was as investment minded then as I am now, I would have sunk every penny I had into Amazon stock."
03/23/2021,stocks,AWS sets up any small operations for scalability. Hard to crash your servers when AWS is spawning three clones every time you hit a threshold.
03/23/2021,stocks,"People have no idea bc their advertising is dog shit.  Most people only see cool football analytics that could be calculated with the PHP Zukerberg wrote to hack Harvard and a TI 84

Done on purpose, I'd also add.  Once they're in a spot where there's nothing that can possibly catch them then you'll recognize AWS as the skynet that its always been (literally it's the closest thing, fuck your Alexa and Google Home) with only some slight recall to that stupid replay of Drew Brees hitting a 1 in 367000 gap to go off of.  You'll say ""huh, that's the product that now controls my entire life?  When did that happen?"""

03/23/2021,stocks,"To be honest, I am surprised by this comment, and certainly don't want to dismiss it. On the one hand, the company makes US$ 1.1B in software and services revenue alone, so one would say it can't be /that/ bad, right?

On the other hand, people like you who use the tools day-to-day are probably the best judges of how well the tools really perform. Can you give examples of what is bad / what do you think they should be doing better?

The acquisition of Onshape and Arena are putting them on a much more modern path than their first products (the 'cash cows', many would say).

Have you used the AR Tools like Vuforia Chalk and Expert Capture for example?"

03/23/2021,stocks,"Sorry I didn’t mean to be rude, I should have phrased better. My brain just feel lost a little when seeing no AMZN or MSFT at least for cloud haha. I’m glad you edited it later lol.

Imo your take is not that bad lol, but it’s actually many of them are new companies with no profit. All are basically growth stock with very high risk. It’s just because many start to talk about that from last or this year so it became a good stock all of a sudden. I suggested adding some stock with good cash flow and earning abilities to make your portfolio more stable and diversified . Just in case if all of your stock are high risk growth stock and didn’t turn out what it is meant to be, you will earned very little or even lost, compared to giants like FAANG/FAAMG which people thought their stock has peaked or slowed down in growth rate, and might actually end up skyrocketing or still growing in a good rate since they have dominated most market share. Imo In the new era of investing, winner takes all.

03/23/2021,stocks,"That snippet from Deloitte exemplifies the need for crypto (blockchain) technologies. And no, I didn't mean crypto based stocks. I thought this was r/investing not r/stocks when I first read it so that's my bad. Sorry!

IoT has been peddled for at least 15 years, if not longer. I can remember learning about it in middle school on the Discovery channel. In order for IoT to be secure, it's going to need a blockchain enabled, decentralized network, or else all the devices on the IoT network are going to be at risk of failure via a single point of contact.

I'm with you 100% on 3D printing and 75% with you on robotics & automation - flexible machines may limit growth long term once it's established, but near term, as it is developed, it will boom as an industry.  I'm just not so sure about anything company that provides SaaS that can't eventually be performed on a decentralized platform."
03/23/2021,stocks,"This is where my minds at too.

I 100% agree on cybersecurity.

I’d add space exploration 

Also, as a designer and marketer, I’ve got my eyes on the decentralized web (aka Web3) right now. I am thinking that a lot of the future is in blockchain technology. The whole shared public ledger system could change so much about jobs and society. (For good and bad)

Some things I’m researching right now:

- IPFS - no stock but learning the tech will be helpful
- Handshake domains
- The Graph
- Decentraland 
- NFTs (yes, lol. But I’m an artist at heart.) Not recommending as an investment, but something to watch and learn about. Provable assets that live on the blockchain could include so many things
- AR - we are still in infancy but if Apple releases AR glasses, an entire new visual infrastructure will begin to be built around us. And if blockchain sorts its kinks out around this time, NFTs will be huge in AR
- Basic attention token (BAT) - could completely change the advertising industry and give the power back to the content creators
- Brave - a new security-focused browser where data is stored locally and you get payed in BAT to see ads

As far as stocks go, stocks for reputable companies in this space should see some success. Coinbase comes to mind.

Just to name a few innovations. All speculative but showing some promise."

03/23/2021,stocks,Agreed but why is their stock going down recently. Same with ASML.
03/23/2021,stocks,"An interesting tidbit, when I worked at Intel, BMW came to them to make the chips for the i3. The amount of chips they wanted could be produced in one week due to Intel's huge manufacturing capacity. Intel turned them away because it just wasn't worth the effort.

Intel had also turned away Apple for their mobile platform in its early stages. At the time, the decision may have made sense but in hindsight was a huge mistake and gave rise to TSMC."

With everything they have added over the years, namely droplets and custom images, one can configure an image once and be good to go when wanting to replicate a system architecture for a nee project or environment. 

I would argue that digital ocean is the most cost effective and flexible, where as AWS/azure have a lot more tooling and can be more agile; although, the tooling gap is marginally decreasing with time."

It could happen eventually, but I think most healthcare companies will be behind us (along with other industries like state/local governments). Should still be a good market for Okta for the next 2-5 years. After that who knows. At that point you're probably spot on."
03/23/2021,stocks,Every business I've seen using Okta is locked into a contract with them from before MFA was widespread and plans to escape as soon as they're able. I personally belive Okta is going to have to really innovate to compete with all of the other cheaper solutions out there.

Which make and model do you actually like?"
03/23/2021,stocks,"So production is down since the 70s?
It makes sense if know the bare minimum about history.

But productivity entirely being down just seems false. I’m probably wrong.

Can I get just like a sound byte style answer if it’s possible?
Ah nevermind I think I understand.
Productivity growth being down actually makes sense. Its not something that grows exponentially so it’s going to decline.
It’s going to steady out and become essentially “flat” I’m not really sure why this matters though?"
03/23/2021,stocks,"Rigetti, IBM, Google, etc, are teeming with people who eat, sleep, breathe quantum computing. These people want to do research and to do that you want to be where the machines are. They are more than capable of building the thin layer of software that QUBT is selling to wrap their services. There’s no point in doing that because widespread use of this stuff is so far out. The companies motivated to learn about QC can very easily learn both IBM’s software and Google’s software. They aren’t even that different. This is just a cheap ploy to snag investors who don’t know better and think QUBT is solving a real problem. If Rigetti came out with a road-ready QC for everyone tomorrow, they’d have the interface done the next day."

03/23/2021,stocks,"AR and VR, id agree also...so the ones that would benefit from this are the major game companies right now imo.

The weird thing is, most of these companies are pretty large as it is and for them to grow, youd either need larger adoption, more people throwing money it, larger population growth to add to the demand.



space exploration, i dont think there's a large consumer market for that, especially since most od the population is broke and pay check to pay check."
03/23/2021,stocks,"I agree with you that blockchain has massive future potential. My issue right now with investing in blockchain related companies, is I've yet to find one that isn't deeply tied to bitcoin. And while I like bitcoin and own some, I don't want to increase my exposure to it, but I'd like to gain exposure specifically to the huge potential of blockchain as a technology, not a currency system.

I like Tzero a lot, but the only way to invest directly in it is to sign up for the platform, and it's US only for now. I've got some OSTK (they own tzero), but I'd really rather not be invested in their furniture business. 

What I'm getting at is there doesn't seem to be much in the way of publicly traded blockchain companies that aren't just crypto focused or aren't doing mainly something different completely and have some side ventures in blockchain.

03/23/2021,stocks,"Reducing carbon output isn't enough any more. We need to actively remove carbon from the air. Microsoft, for example, plans to become carbon negative in a few years and remove all carbon emitted by the company since its founding."
03/23/2021,stocks,False. We have the tech today to make meaningful contributions toward reaching net zero. What we don't have is the political will.
03/23/2021,stocks,"I invested in uranium because I believe there will advancements toward making nuclear fusion possible, which would in turn make the creation of nuclear fusion power plants viable. I believe the main reason it isn't talked about yet much in mainstream media is because of the massive shadow hanging over the word nuclear and there's no need to warm people up to the idea yet with the required tech not being available yet. It's starting to be talked about more though, and interest in related stocks have been evident since Biden won.

I could be totally wrong but as it is right now it is the only area where I see  true potential for an energy source that can provide the massive output we'll need. Of course that goes combined with solar and wind, but I don't see just those two (and hydroelectricity) being able to cover our needs on their own."
03/23/2021,stocks,I like $WWR just because graphite is gonna be big in more energy efficient batteries in the future! Obviously I’m just speculating but I think they can be a big player down the line!

03/23/2021,stocks,"Simply modern chips are very hard to manufacture and they have a huge share of the market developing chips for Apple, making AMD’s chips etc. They look to have some rock solid business from the biggest tech manufacturers for at least another 5 years or so. 

If you want to go one step back, ASML make the machines that TSMC use. The sort of machines that cost $140m each and have to be ordered months in advance for the factories."
03/23/2021,stocks,"A lot of the leading semi players rely on them. If there are secular growth trends for semiconductors like the moves we've seen with businesses building out their cloud infrastructure or the increasing demand for higher computing power TSM is benefitting. Some of their customers include AMD, Apple, Nvidia, Broadcom, and Qualcomm. They are firing on all cylinders and operating at 100% capacity. Basically their services are in high demand and their capacity is fully booked through next year."
03/23/2021,stocks,"People are hyping up semi conductors a lot right now and deservedly so. Just beware that they have a lot of room to drop if they start going down as people have priced in a lot of future growth. It is important to compare them to cisco in a lot of ways. People see the value of semi conductors now in a lot of the same ways that people saw the value of networking equipment in 2001. Investors thought that the internet was going to be built on cisco tech and it largely was, but that did not mean that cisco was the biggest winner from the internet and it did not mean that cisco deserved the valuation it had at the time. People can be completely right about their prediction that a company is going to be massive and achieve extraordinary things, like they are predicting for semiconductors, while also overpaying for them and losing a lot of money."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Hodl that shit for the next 5 years, then reassess. It’s not losing steam by any means. Cathie Wood is extremely bullish on it too, which tells you something."

03/23/2021,stocks,"Aapl is one of the most important companies.  They don't make shit, they make iphones."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Yeah this is part of what makes automotive so competitive and so lucrative - the big fish sort of ignore it because the requirements are tough and really specific and the quantity isn't that huge. it used to be that getting designed in meant that you had a revenue stream for like a decade, but apparently recently that isn't quite the case anymore. Auto manufacturers are more willing to swap chips mid generation over a difference of pennies per chip, a consequence of ever improving design automation for electronic modules."
03/23/2021,stocks,Don't know that much about Micron aside from generally where they fit in size wise
03/23/2021,stocks,GDDR6 and it’s variants look extremely promising. I’m high on them as they’re the second largest semiconductor fab after Intel and the United States is about to pass the Endless Frontier Act. Look it up it’s exciting stuff!
03/23/2021,stocks,"I think that because there are so few big names here they all tend to be considered winners already and priced as such. And manufacturing suppliers are a little less important if the main profit drivers are going to be lower qty higher profit semis in auto and industrial. Which is to say the game isn't going to be more chips it's going to be higher quality chips - and not necessarily smaller transistors, but more reliable and better designed. All to say that the cutting edge equipment isn't super critical to this thesis"
03/23/2021,stocks,At this point y'all should just buy soxx or smh
03/23/2021,stocks,"Eh maybe. They are not necessarily big enough imo to be considered a 'sector bet' - the whole industrial sector could explode and leave lots of the names behind. Others are big enough that they are going to win in at least some segments, compete in others and outright lose in some, but still win overall. They're a bit cheaper than the others, but not much."
03/23/2021,stocks,Where do you think lithium comes from? It doesn’t grow on trees. You don’t want lithium mined stop buying electrical products that use lithium battery’s. The reason I mention it is obvious.

03/23/2021,stocks,You can literally look up Intel AI division and it will tell you everything they are involved in on the AI sector and its a lot. Plus they own a separate division called Habana Labs which develops AI systems. Also if you look at their investor presentations and income statements its one of their growing fields and they are investing heavily in it. Don’t be so quick to dismiss them like the fool below me.
03/23/2021,stocks,I feel like Intel is getting left behind. They can’t seem to keep up. Skeptical when I see praise and wonder if people have actually read about their tech recently.
03/23/2021,stocks,"They open source it because it allows more people to use the code and fix bugs + develop it. The gold mine is not in the machine learning code library, but rather what they can do with it using the data and compute power that only Google owns."
03/23/2021,stocks,"I don’t know how attuned I am with the direction of tech these days - I left the field about five years ago - but there are a few trends that I see progressing. 

-  Programmatic advertising on music streaming, VOD, and connected TV. Think about how targeted Facebook and Google ads are and apply that same technology to ads sold on on-demand streaming services and live television. It’s such a gold mine that the big name in the space, $TTD, doesn’t even mark up the cost of the add space. Instead, clients tell them how much they want to spend and TTD takes a cut of that, about 20%. That may sound like a lot, but TTD’s massive growth, strong fundamentals, and profitability shows marketers are willing to pay for it. As the VOD, connected TV, and music streaming space continues to grow, so will TTD. 

That’s my only real highlight at the moment. The only other thing that comes to mind is physical internet infrastructure. Bandwidth requirements are going to continue to grow and will accelerate rapidly as autonomous driving develops. Anything that a packet of data from a self driving vehicle touches is going to require more investment to support the demand. I think we’re all already aware of the the other major trends in tech, so I want mention them here. The bulk of my current investing thesis is mostly focused on the electrification of the automotive market and all of the infrastructure and ancillary business that would need to grow to support it. Between a solidified move towards EV adoption and renewed efforts from the White House to heavily invest in infrastructure, it’s a growth double whammy."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Visa is easy money, but there is a lot of payment processors and infrastructure that are doing exciting stuff. I’m bullish on decentralized finance long term"

03/23/2021,stocks,"I appreciate the perspective and that makes perfect sense.  Not sure that I'll be buying in for a mid term play but it will be interesting to see what happens to them.  If they have a stronghold in an industry like healthcare, they may be alright beyond the 2-5 years that you mentioned."
03/23/2021,stocks,You’re saying KOMP is a fund that uses AI to day trade on 400+ stocks or what? I’m interested.
03/23/2021,stocks,400+ stocks = less risk but less likely upside? Too diversified?

03/23/2021,stocks,"Not production. Production is obviously much higher now than it was in the 70s.

I am talking about productivity growth, that growth has been slowing. Labor productivity growth powers economic growth.

03/23/2021,stocks,"I’ll start first by saying that QUBTs software has been matched up against dWaves qbsolv and been declared better in most every way. They also have many products that are fully developed. The team leading this company is comprised of experts in physics and mathematics, some employees come from dWave and other from places like Cray research. So I don’t think it’s fair to call it a scam company. I understand your argument of other companies like IBM being able to go direct to consumer with their own proprietary software, however like mentioned earlier QUBTs is more advanced, and can work on ionQ, Dwave, rigetti and IBM. The main problem with QC right now is that it’s very niche and only used by specific companies. QUBTs goal is to make so all businesses that want to harness the capabilities of QC , can do so. I like that you bring up that someone like IBM can just whip up software and make QUBT obsolete, but like I mentioned their software has beaten that of dWaves and they have people from dWave in their company. Also the whole point of, “why try when there’s someone better than you” hurts innovation and slows the adoption of QC more. In short I respect your criticisms but I feel if you looked deeper into what they can offer and what their mission is, you might change your mind."
03/23/2021,stocks,"I also want to add that one of their advantages right now is that their software can be operated by regular developers with no huge learning curve, which saves a lot of money for businesses."
03/23/2021,stocks,"For the most part, yes, the big guys will see success. However, Unity Games is definitely one to do DD on. They are a platform for gaming developers. 3D designers love them. Currently researching them as an investment myself.

Space exploration is a long ways off and totally a gamble at this point. But now that Bezos is leaving Amazon to focus on space exploration it has my attention as a thing to watch. It could flop, or it could be one of those things that looks impossible due to a current lack of consumer interest and funding yet benefits from a major unknown variable change down the line."
03/23/2021,stocks,I wonder if that's why Cathy Woods is buying $U (Unity). It's a platform for developers to make indie and VR games.
03/23/2021,stocks,"I think VR is sooner than AR, since it's already here to an extent,  but effective and lightweight AR would be massive for real world interactivity, experiences, communications, etc. It would reshape a lot of social behaviors and interactions, medical therapies and real world gaming."

03/23/2021,stocks,I think amd will do very good this year with all their new technologies and innovation I think it surpassing 100$ is pretty reasonable.
03/23/2021,stocks,It literally is losing steam most of this young year though isn’t it? I got in at high $120’s/low 130’s and it’s been all downhill. Same for my ASML stock. Is it just that they’re building new plants and using revenue to do so?
03/23/2021,stocks,Doesn't Apple have one of the highest market caps in the world? I'd say it's the antithesis of undervalued...
03/23/2021,stocks,Exactly. TSLA already has the revolution OP mentioned priced into its valuation.
03/23/2021,stocks,For now. Their battery technology could be a force in the home and industry energy sector much like their cars were in the automotive sector.
03/23/2021,stocks,People still buy them and that’s all that really matters. Apple is overpriced too but that’s never mattered

03/23/2021,stocks,Oh I’m heavily invested in Intel I just focus on their fab manufacturing and not on their software side. So thanks for the insight JR!
03/23/2021,stocks,I think that is a fair assumption. Personally the upside I see in them is their insanely large most and marketshare. Along with a massive R&D budget and being the largest and most important American semiconductor fab makes me believe they can turn it around starting late 2022 when their high density nodes come out.
03/23/2021,stocks,Than you clearly have not done any reading ;)

03/23/2021,stocks,"I have used most of the services out there. There isn’t a huge difference. These guys are selling cardboard boxes with wheels painted on them while Henry Ford is working in his garage.

Scams are everywhere."
03/23/2021,stocks,"This is also true of qiskit or cirq or forest. Any dev can write lines of code. You still have to know something about quantum computing for it to do something useful, and that will never change."

03/23/2021,stocks,"Interesting, but I don't understand the chinese market enough to invest in chinese tech startups. Plus seems like they're getting into mining which I'm trying to avoid."
03/23/2021,stocks,"sure but it filled an actual immediate consumer need.

theres no immediate consumer need for a greener planet right now. Everyone is worried about paying for their bills ,saving money, theirs and their kids health, and how they will feed themselves in the future."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Yes they're doing lots of good stuff but their revenue is gonna be bottlenecked by the semiconductor shortages. It will be interesting to see how they do, but I wouldn't be so sure that they'll do amazingly."

03/23/2021,stocks,"Their battery tech is just putting a big usb lithium ion batter pack in people's homes. Where is the innovation and what stops others from just doing the same (see the multiple other battery manufacturers that already exist).

Not to mention stuff like grid scale storage is probably going to be solved at an industrial scale, not an individual scale."
03/23/2021,stocks,"TSLA would currently have to make a profit for 1,900 years to make enough money to cover what the market thinks they’re worth. They own nothing close to $700 bn in assets, lose money, and have made nothing close to that in revenue, let alone profit. Even if they were to rapidly scale manufacturing and sales, their competition is robust with GM, Ford, Toyota, Mitsubishi, and however many companies poised to enter the EV game, on top of autonomous ride share tech threatening to upend global car ownership. 

What do their batteries add to the equation that is missing?"
03/23/2021,stocks,If that is your logic then why bother doing any research or look at any fundamentals. Just buy the new fad.
03/23/2021,stocks,That would be like Ford going out of business 100 years ago just because General Motors started making cars. Tesla was the first and they'll stick around but their marketshare will obviously be eaten into by competitors as time goes on.
03/23/2021,stocks,"I think Tesla will work out like Apple though. Sure, other companies can make better devices at a much cheaper price. But those aren't Apple.

Btw their shares are currently up over 5% since they are now building two new factories in Arizona and will continue manufacturing their own chips with the chip shortage going on. A lot going on with this company.

They say in they reports accessible by the public that investing in them is a risk because of the very reasons you brought up(besides the scam part obviously) and after watching interviews with lead management they don’t make outlandish claims.

03/23/2021,stocks,Yeah exactly. Can’t really rely on the market to fix correct systematic collapse. Much more of an economic incentive to buy up potable water and sell it at a huge premium down the line than to clean up polluted rivers or whatever. Let’s not delude ourselves here that this is all going to end well AND we get rich on the way. This could all go up in flames preeety quick once it really gets started.

03/23/2021,stocks,"Go back to their battery day. Many people found the battery day to be lacking but looking into the technical outlooks it was a huge announcement.   Tesla will make its batteries six times more powerful and increase range by 16 percent. It’s also making improvements to its process that will make cathodes 76 percent cheaper. 

I am going to leave out starlink, even though i think that is revolutionary and focus on Autobidder.  

Autobidder provides independent power producers, utilities and capital partners with the ability to autonomously monetize battery assets. Autobidder is a real-time trading and control platform that provides value-based asset management and portfolio optimization, enabling owners and operators to configure operational strategies that maximize revenue based on their business objectives and risk preferences.

The current problem of our power grid is that it is not efficient. Yes Teslas power wall is just a battery on the wall if u think about it like that but it can be so much more. Instead of a power grid that is linear you now have the ability to add many more nodes as a source of power. Imagine Instead of power being cutoff due to the main power station being lost like what we saw in Texas, we have a vast range of energy nodes to draw from. We would be able to keep critical infrastructure online by allocating power from saved energy in the event of a crisis.  Batteries also helps to eliminate the peak energy problem with clean energy. Solar and Wind are great when conditions are right but it fails when peak usage is needed.

03/23/2021,stocks,"Go back to their battery day. Many people found the battery day to be lacking but looking into the technical outlooks it was a huge announcement.   Tesla will make its batteries six times more powerful and increase range by 16 percent. It’s also making improvements to its process that will make cathodes 76 percent cheaper. 

I am going to leave out starlink, even though i think that is revolutionary and focus on Autobidder.  

Autobidder provides independent power producers, utilities and capital partners with the ability to autonomously monetize battery assets. Autobidder is a real-time trading and control platform that provides value-based asset management and portfolio optimization, enabling owners and operators to configure operational strategies that maximize revenue based on their business objectives and risk preferences.

The current problem of our power grid is that it is not efficient. Yes Teslas power wall is just a battery on the wall if u think about it like that but it can be so much more. Instead of a power grid that is linear you now have the ability to add many more nodes as a source of power. Imagine Instead of power being cutoff due to the main power station being lost like what we saw in Texas, we have a vast range of energy nodes to draw from. We would be able to keep critical infrastructure online by allocating power from saved energy in the event of a crisis.  Batteries also helps to eliminate the peak energy problem with clean energy. Solar and Wind are great when conditions are right but it fails when peak usage is needed. Batteries and microsystems help by allocating the draw of power when the source power is at its most optimal. As of now without a battery the energy is not meeting its true potential.

2021-03-22 22:21:40,stocks,"Tomorrow's bond auction Good article below on potential paths for this week's bond auction.

Pro: poor situation in Europe will increase demand for the bonds, lowering yield

Con: removal of bank SLR rule will lower banks interest in purchasing bonds, lowering demand from banks, increasing yield

&#x200B;

What are your thoughts on what will happen? Article from the street:

&#x200B;

U.S. Treasury yields ticked lower Monday, providing early support for tech stocks that could extend throughout the week as the government looks to unload nearly $330 billion in new debt onto a cautious and unsteady bond market.

&#x200B;

Turkey President Recep Tayyip Erdogan fired the country's central bank chief, Naci Agba, over the weekend, just days after he had approved an 200 basis point interest rate hike designed to blunt the impact of inflation in the struggling economy. 

&#x200B;

""The new political interference from Erdogan, who has long railed against hiking interest rates because he thinks they cause inflation, send the lira into a tailspin on fears that international investors will pull their money from the country on concerns of new rate cuts the would undermine the orthodox “'bitter medicine' of further interest rate hikes to stabilize and strengthen the currency,"" said Saxo Bank strategists. ""The country is already low on reserves and could, in extremis have to implement capital controls if capital flight, whether domestic or foreign, becomes a deepening problem.""

&#x200B;

The move sent the Turkish lira down 15% against the U.S. dollar, the steepest decline in nearly three years, and triggered a rush to safe-have assets in Europe and elsewhere, including U.S. Treasury bonds, with benchmark 10-year notes falling to 1.68% from the 1.75% peak, the highest since January 2020, they reached during the height of last -week's sell off.

&#x200B;

Ironically, much of what Governor Agba said with respect to rate hikes -- which he linked to shift in global investor appetite, loose central bank policies around the world, rising commodity prices and near-term inflation risks -- are concerns that have triggered the longest rise in U.S. Treasury bond yields in eight years and corresponding pullback in tech and growth stocks.

&#x200B;

Further upward pressure followed last week when the Federal Reserve, fresh off its March policy meeting that pledge to keep rates at record lows for at least the next two years -- even as the economy looks set to grow at its fastest pace since 1984 -- ended a capital break for domestic banks that could lead to further Treasury bond sales, and thus higher yields, in the months ahead.

&#x200B;

Normally, that would have investors exceedingly nervous heading into a hectic week of bond auctions, which includes a $60 billion sale of benchmark 2-year notes on Tuesday and another $62 billion in 7-year notes on Thursday, as inflation signals hot up and deficit hawks renew their criticisms of the Biden Administration's $1.9 trillion American Rescue Act.

&#x200B;

Turkey's brewing currency crisis, however, alongside the sputtering vaccine rollout efforts in Europe that are likely to delay the region's post-pandemic re-opening, are likely to boost demand from international investors for the U.S. assets on sale this week, keeping prices high and borrowing costs low.

&#x200B;

A $38 billion sale of benchmark 10-year notes earlier this month, in fact, drew solid international demand, with foreign investors taking up 57% of the overall total. 

&#x200B;

That said, analysts at JPMorgan caution that the Fed's removal of the SLR benefit, just as primary dealers are likely needed to take-up a greater share of the $209 billion in coupon paper on sale this week, could lead to another leg higher in Treasury yields -- and corresponding pressures on U.S. stocks -- in the days ahead.

&#x200B;

""While valuations are supportive of increased demand from foreign investors ... foreign demand alone is unlikely to stabilize Treasury yields,"" JPMorgan said. ""Moreover, over the very near term, liquidity conditions lend upside risk to yields ahead of (this) week’s supply process."""
2021-03-22 22:18:30,stocks,"Earnings Report Question Correct me if I am wrong. 

1.In the scenario where an earnings report is negative. If investors do not sell their shares due to lack of faith in the company. The share price will remain the same.

2. In the same scenario above. If the earnings report is positive and no new buyers buy or sell shares. The price remains the same. 


3. Earnings report fluctuations in share prices are the result of buying and selling of shares, company news and future/current outlook, as well other market metrics. If so what are these ""other market metrics.""

2021-03-22 22:08:08,stocks,"SPY (SPDR S&P 500 ETF TRUST) or TSLA? I noticed SPY CONTAINS TSLA, and I’ve been seeing A LOT of people supporting SPY. Basically, I have $2,400 to invest, and I WAS going to invest it all into AVLR (AVALARA) but Cathie Wood thinks TSLA will hit $3,000 a share by 2025, and I’m a big supporter in technology and AI, and more specifically, self driving cars.

AVLR is HEAVILY PROMOTED by Stephen McBride, who thinks it’s the “Amazon Killer tollbooth stock”, that owning will mean “collecting a fraction of EVERY ONLINE TRANSACTION ONLINE. It automates tax compliance, which means easily avoiding tax audits, so it’s likely every company will eventually purchase and use them for sorting out their taxes.

I’ve pretty much given up on the idea of getting rich quick. I hope my whole life won’t be dependent on one day getting huge returns to finally be free and enjoy life (GME really got me determined, suddenly making a big 6-7 figure amount would mean I’m free of all of society’s BS and social class oppression and inequality, and I could make up for 25 years of misery and loneliness, and start enjoying life as the game I think it should be while I’m alive).

But, GME did show that sudden unexpected rockets can take off, so there’s always the possibility of suddenly finding I have 6-7 figure gains at any moment, it’s happened with GME (and probably other companies in the past).

I don’t know how to fix my life in the short-term, and society seems to be structured around planning for the long-term (I disagree that life and working is all about “RETIREMENT” for when your old), but why not try and do what I can? And sudden immediate skyrocketing is possible.

Being debt free at my age, and even 7-10K in the bank savings account doesn’t have much value when you’re so directionless and lack any valuable job skills or qualifications, and you’ve missed out on your “prime years”, and aren’t even prepared for adulthood. 

I have a very low paying job that’s very low skill and even working 40 hour work weeks consistently, not even $2,000 a month. I’m still there because I’m scared of getting a better job and being let go for my insecurities sabotaging me or just not understanding things, and then not having any job at all again.

Short-term solutions seem to be out of the question (who cares that rent and utilities and food are necessities, not the US government or the corporations paying their employees wages to live off of!) so I guess I just have to focus on the long-term?"
2021-03-22 21:59:28,stocks,"Wash sale question I thought I understood how this worked but maybe not.

Let’s say I bought a few shares of a stock at $20 and then it drops in price so I buy a few more to lower my cost basis and then it drops again so I buy more to lower it further.  A month later the stock is selling for more than my cost basis (so net profit) but LESS than what I originally bought the first shares for.

If I exit my position entirely and pocket my $5 or whatever ... why would that trigger a wash sale if a few weeks (less than 31 days) later I decide to re-enter at a lower price point?

As far as I’m aware I didn’t incur a loss so I shouldn’t have triggered a wash sale but according to my broker I did so I was hoping someone could explain what I did wrong."

The repair strategy is buy 1 long call with a strike price of current market price $20 and sell 2 short calls at strike half way between purchase price and current market price which is $25

Buying more shares to chase a losing stock can and often times end up losing more not to mention tying up more capital that could be used elsewhere more profitably. Options are much less capital to hopefully reach a break even point. 

If the option strategy works you buy 100 shares at the lower strike price and sell 200 shares at the higher strike price thus breaking even. Not investment advice research repair stock option strategy."

2021-03-22 21:44:42,stocks,"Is there value in only buying a few shares of a stock? I keep finding new companies to invest in but sometimes only buy 1-5 shares, which ultimately  might not amount to a large increase in money over the course of 5+ years (assuming it goes up at all).

For example, I bought one share of chewy for $80 cause I like the company and I think they have a nice future. I don’t necessarily think the stock will reach $500, but I feel confident of it hitting $160 someday. So only a profit of $80 over the course of a few years. 

Another example, I bought 2 shares in Costco at $330. I don’t think it’ll “go to the moon” but maybe it’ll reach 400. Again, not a lot of money to ultimately cash out on someday. 

I’ve taken this approach with 15+ stocks I want to hold because I think they’ll do well but I don’t necessarily want to drop thousands of dollars in each. So far I’ve invested about 40k.

TLDR: is there value in only buying a few shares of the average performing stock? Or do I need to up my percentage? For arguments sake let’s ignore using the extremely rare Amazon or apple example that someone bought for $5 and it has turned them into a millionaire) I’m talking about the average performing stock."
03/23/2021,stocks,Yes there is benefit. Try to calculate gains by percentage instead just because a 100 dollar stock going up 10 dollars is still impressive.

03/23/2021,stocks,Unfortunately Joe Mansion says he won’t vote for a infrastructure bill that doesn’t have Republican support and no way any republicans touch a package that has money for green energy so unless he has a change of heart which is unlikely because he is the usual roadblock in the senate and will almost always stand his ground this bill is doa and many investors don’t realize this yet and a lot of stocks have this bill passing priced in already. Basically though a bunch of stupid political rules this bill has to be passed though budget reconciliation which requires 51 votes with the senate tied 50/50 the dems would either need a Republican defector (not going to happen) or all 50 dems including the most conservative Joe Mansion and his current stance is a no on any more reconciliation spending without republicans so we are going to be in gridlock for a while doesn’t mean it won’t pass though just something to keep in mind

No sensible or even remotely competent controls were put in place, and businesses scrambled to dip their hands as deep in the till as they could whether they needed the money or not.  In fact a whole new sub industry was created to facilitate companies grabbing as much as they could and as quickly as possible.  If you went through other parts of the Covid relief bills then you would find the same thing, whether it is unemployment or whatever.  This is how politics works.

In my opinion, her prediction is an attempt to keep the hype alive, but the hype is dying. She wants Ark’s investments in Tesla to pay off, so she made this prediction as a way to bring back investors.

I think that the hype is over, and today’s boost was a last stand after her prediction. What do you guys think, should we sell or hold?

-

Update: I’ve decided to sell around half of my shares and hold the other half. Luckily I sold at $696 before it dropped to $667. I’m going to reinvest that half into Microsoft, Apple, and Disney. *Hopefully* the other half of my Tesla shares skyrocket like Cathie Wood predicts."

03/23/2021,stocks,If you think a stock is all hype then obviously you should sell.

The truth is that as outlandish as the price target seems, they’re good at what they do. They have better resources, access to research, and specialized researchers than reddit. At the end of the day we can guess if they’re right or not, but the possibility of tesla still being undervalued is still non-zero.

03/23/2021,stocks,"As someone who owns lots of TSLA I hope you're right in that your halved position still profits. Unfortunately, I would never have done that. 

What most people don't understand is TSLA is NOT a car company. TSLA is a DATA company. TSLA has over 30,000 times as much automated data as the second competitor (up for debate who this really is) and this data is used to constantly make autopilot more effective. 

This data is worth (arguably) around a trillion dollars.

Also, ask yourself about the charging scene: who is going to beat TSLA in 1. exclusivity or 2. locationality? 

Lucid claims they'll double TSLA's charger amount in half the time it took TSLA to build it. THIS is a claim you should be bullish on, not Cathy's hypothesis.

TSLA has tracked the ""tech wrecK' and the percent drawdown had been similar to many key tech stocks and ETFs - all overbought. You asked for our thoughts - my systems say now is not the time to sell since the stock, and the tech sector in general, is starting to recover from the recent drop. Traders have a powerful tendency to buy near tops and sell near bottoms as our brains project trends. The opposite is how money is made in the stock market - buy low, sell high, not the reverse."

Yes she is holding Tesla now but she knows a lot of young people have piled in because it is a sexy stock.  She is in a lot of stocks that have that kind of appeal and can be hyped.  She is very loud about liking the stock now but will one day get out very quietly ( sorry bag holders, not sorry). Lots of stock pumping right now.  DOGECOIN! for example.  It is fine if you know these are short term plays but when in comes to holding long the business prospects and fundamentals win out.  And yes Tesla has room to grow but it is now worth more than every other car company on the planet.  Also Elon does push new technologies and ideas which is great but many are not part of Tesla."

03/23/2021,stocks,"Reading some of ARK's assumptions made me want to own TSLA even less.  First of all, their ""bear case"" shows 5 million vehicles sold in 2025.  They sold 500k in 2020, and that's a 36% increase from 2019 -- very healthy growth, but 36%/year isn't gonna do it to get to 5 million, let alone 10 million.   In fact, in order for that to happen they'd probably have to become one of the dominant players in the US auto market plus a significant presence in other markets, and I just don't see that happening in less than four years where it's currently kind of a niche product and people tend to be loyal to brands (for example I've owned only Hondas for the past 15 years)."

03/23/2021,stocks,"If Tesla made $30B and kept the same price they’d have a PE of 20. I don’t see why they’d double in price just because they met their crazy (already priced in) expectations.

03/23/2021,stocks,I have no skin in the game. But what exactly has Tesla done in the past year to prove those skeptics wrong? Just because the price went up in the past year that doesn’t mean Tesla was undervalued then. It could just mean it’s more overvalued now.

They could execute perfectly, and it would justify CURRENT valuation in 5 years. Markets are forward looking and have decided TSLA is the leader in EV, but they have already priced it to the point where they dominate the market. 

If tsla does what is expected, it’s not gonna be a constant pump. They just did what was required to justify the price NOW. 

If they don’t meet those perfect expectations, oh man, it’s gonna be a blood bath."

Current non-Telsa charging networks suck. 
* All these other manufacturers are relying on vendor-sourced batteries (Tesla does too, to some degree, with Panasonic and others but Tesla has the Gigafactory). This will be a big bottleneck. 
* Other manufacturers are not getting into self-driving like Tesla and Waymo are (to be fair, I'm also skeptical of Tesla's ability to do accomplish higher levels of autonomous driving with cameras vs LIDAR).

That said, the companies with really high P/E ratios these days (or non-existent P/Es because their earnings are negative) seem to be the companies you just described: unprofitable and debt laden. It's this prolonged period of low interest rates that has allowed many of these companies to take on a lot of debt and loans in hopes of expanding and becoming profitable by the time they need to refinance or start paying those debts. However, because many of these companies are in tech they are seen as attractive businesses to some investors which is why there are so many skeptics for some of these companies with outrageous valuations with a supposedly promising future (example someone gave above was Uber - good product that people use but in terms of investing they don't turn a profit)."

Cameras alone cannot solve L5 autonomy, and incorporating lidar would mean Tesla will have to either raise the price on its cars or incur a loss directly.

I'm in the industry and overall I like Tesla.  I definitely think electric is the future and I am looking forward to our older OEMs moving that direction. I find often that much of what is said about Tesla and their manufacturing is grandiose and seen is a positive light although it should not be. For example I was listening to Dave Lee who I really like talk about Tesla using high pressure diecast for large suspension components, and he acted like Tesla is the only company doing this but all OEMs have done this for years. Then he praised them for putty the die cast machine in a tent so they could get it in production quickly. To me that seems very hazardous.  Injecting extremely high pressure molten aluminum in a die under a plastic roof is not something I would be feeling great about.  If you have spent a day around high pressure die casting this isn't something you would chalk up as a positive outcome like Dave did. But we see this with a lot of Teslas most outspoken investors."

03/23/2021,stocks,"I don't think people are arguing that Tesla isn't set up for success as a company or in their financial books. I think they are going to do well. The issue is with the current valuation and whether the stock price will do as well. Even if the earnings triple in 2 years we're still talking about a P/E of 300-400 assuming the stock price doesn't change. If we want to see stock price growth over the next 2 years then in 2023 people will either still have to pay a significant premium and we'll continue seeing P/E's outrageously high, or the earnings would have to increase significantly. For example, assuming no stock price growth for 5 years (who wants 0% return) the earnings would have to still increase 15-20x just to get to where AMZN's P/E is today. I'm not saying that's the scenario that will play out or that 5 years is a fair timeline for Tesla (7-10 yrs is probably more reasonable in my opinion) I agree that TSLA will remain a growth company and will have a higher P/E. But if they deserve a 70 range P/E like you say, then their earnings will need to increase 20-30x  to also see some stock price growth.

To answer your last question, my opinion doesn't really matter since TSLA doesn't follow 99.9% of the pre-established norms or fundamentals. Fundamentals aren't reliable with growth companies. I personally don't think they'll be as disruptive as many people think they will be in autonomous vehicles, solar, battery storage, etc. I don't see a good ""moat"" that prevents competition in many of these areas. First on scene for some, but not a moat. Many areas are also not high profit margin - the margins on their higher volume selling vehicles is minimal, the margins on their solar are minimal to negative, etc. The hope that they'll get into the SaaS territory and subscriptions for other technologies remains to be seen. Their current business is sustainable, but so far not worthy of the valuation in my portfolio. I think people sometimes include the recent huge run up in their view of TSLA going forward. What everyone needs to do every so often is step back, look at the stock they currently own and decide if it's worth the current price. Can't take the price from 1 or 2 years ago that it was bought at into account because what I or you currently own is what's in the portfolio today."

Actually, their market share has been [remarkably stable](https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/the-cloud-infrastructure-market-hit-129b-in-2020/) over time. Going off this graph, I don't see how you get ""monopoly"" or even ""nearly five time higher than google and their asians competitors"".

Sure, but that holds true for all tech companies. Even Apple would be eclipsed one day by competitors if it start pumping out subpar products and failed marketing campaigns. The most well-run companies with the strongest brand names will continue to dominate, and I'm betting money that Tesla will continue to be one of those names."

03/23/2021,stocks,"I will agree that autonomous driving is a tough task from a broad perspective, but I do believe robotaxis will and can, become a thing relatively quickly.  Florida has been really pushing for electric vehicles, in part, due to their elder population densities and the simplicity of charging and potentially smaller vehicle footprint.  I think robotaxis in spots there are very viable in the same way above ground rail/trolly transit, bus/bike lanes exists in cities now where you adjust your existing infrastructure to support the transit.  If the preponderance of your transit is local and planned communities are built around the idea (most of) what you need is < 2 miles away, that's where robotaxis come into play.  Oregon (suburbs of Portland) is based on high density housing with very localized shopping. Northern VA has similar developments.  With populations of planned communities > 30k in many states, it could be very viable as a means to normalize traffic, lower emissions, etc.. It would take a little retrofitting, but painted lanes, a new sign alerting vehicles to turns, etc.. could easily be done in these locations.  Also, with these scary turns we're seeing, you could see a funneling of autonomous traffic to designated intersections, much like school crosswalks.  That segregates traffic which, in turn, starts to normalize it for the rest of the drivers and the mapping services like Waze accommodate this and redirect non-auto driving to other routes.  Yes, much of this relies on a cohesive architecture, but it's very doable."
03/23/2021,stocks,Agree with your points totally. Building tunnels is super expensive.  How much do you think each mile is going to cost.  Just the studies and the army of engineers needed to calculate if it's feasible will going to cost millions.  Then there's regulation and cost of digging it.  Tesla is absolutely competing with all car manufacturers.  If they weren't after the same customers they wouldn't have built the model 3 or y.  High end s/x are just not generating enough income for them.  Competition is heating up big time. I sold at 700 too.
03/23/2021,stocks,"Sorry been tired and a long day I'm rather done defending this stock I don't care for. The tunnel thing is an example.

They are far but it's absolutely not perfect. The Vegas project is just a proof of concept to the world. Proof these cars can drive safe without incidents and it's a huge political gain on future legislation. 

Toyota is going big for Hydrogen and maybe yes it could be something but for now the infrastructure and development are way behind compared to where the world wide adaptation of EV's is.

>Electric vehicles may be the future, but it doesn't mean that Ford, Toyota, VW, GM, Chrysler etc. Will all just go away.

Yup, they're finally getting in the game, which is nice to see. However, expertise in existing automobile manufacturing doesn't always translate to great EVs. Just like Tesla did for a *long* time (and many argue continue to do so), they have to suffer through a period of problems, bugs, and optimizations. Most notably this was early in Tesla's Model 3 production ramp that Tesla seems to have mostly gotten past.

For me, the closest legacy manufacturer is VW with the ID.3 and ID.4. There were multiple problems with their infotainment system and their over-the-air updates, which tells me that they still need significant investment and experience in the new generation of cars - like many EVs - in the software and infotainment aspect.

Another part with traditional manufacturers is that when they expand into the EV realm, they're eating into their own sales of internal combustion cars. Automaking is notoriously low margin already so it'll be a difficult transition period where they lose revenue from ICE car lines while ramping up non-profitable EV lines. Their business structure is also very resistant to change, and will be the biggest non-engineering challenge. You can see the problem of the dealership model by walking to a Ford dealer and asking to see the Mach-E. You might even see blank stares. EVs - a low cost-of-ownership vehicle - is not good for dealerships that derive a large part of their income selling service contracts.

>Also, for every Amazon..... there's thousands of companies who fail or become mediocre.

And some of the manufacturers you've listed could be prime candidates to fit in this category if they fail to navigate the difficult transition.

At the end of the day though, does my bull case for Tesla justify the valuation? I have no clue. But Tesla is poised to be very competitive in the future, not just in the EV space but in the home energy front."

03/23/2021,stocks,">Even if the earnings triple in 2 years we're still talking about a P/E of 300-400 assuming the stock price doesn't change. If we want to see stock price growth over the next 2 years then in 2023 people will either still have to pay a significant premium and we'll continue seeing P/E's outrageously high, or the earnings would have to increase significantly. For example, assuming no stock price growth for 5 years (who wants 0% return) the earnings would have to still increase 15-20x just to get to where AMZN's P/E is today. I'm not saying that's the scenario that will play out or that 5 years is a fair timeline for Tesla (7-10 yrs is probably more reasonable in my opinion) I agree that TSLA will remain a growth company and will have a higher P/E. But if they deserve a 70 range P/E like you say, then their earnings will need to increase 20-30x  to also see some stock price growth.

First, I want to thank you for genuinely engaging in good faith discussion with me rather than outright dismissing and hand waving Tesla as overvalued without any actual counter argument as some tend to do. 

I agree that Tesla needs to grow earnings significantly to justify the current valuation and to justify stock price growth. The good news is that’s exactly what Tesla is on track to do. Analysts estimate Tesla will make $2.67/share on a GAAP basis in 2021, which is >4x 2020’s EPS of $0.64 (these are the same analysts which Tesla beat the expectations of 3 out of the last 4 quarters). Assuming these analysts are correct, Tesla only needs to 4-5x 2021 earnings to justify the current stock price. This is entirely doable for a company that is guiding for 50% CAGR top line growth. I am of the opinion that Tesla can 10-12x their profits over the next 5 years, and hence I am bullish even at today’s prices. That said, I’d probably sell almost all of my holdings if the share price were to go above $1000 this year, because at that point it is difficult to reasonably justify"
03/23/2021,stocks,"Agree to disagree. If you look at all auto manufacturers' concept cars, they're electric. Tesla is the only company solidly producing them right now. Plus they're investing in R&D to develop, among other things, better battery tech which will be the catalyst for industry transformation (albeit it's speculation if they're going to be the ones to do it). But Cathy's investment style is geared toward companies that are trying to change industries, or are on the forefront of a changing industry.

There are some folks who are less experienced with the market,  who have lived through this bull market that haven't quite seen the potential risk first hand.

03/23/2021,stocks,"It is refreshing, isn't it? I actually haven't looked at the most recent earnings projections so that was helpful. I realized over the past year that the arguments back and forth about Tesla boil down to people arguing about their own investment philosophy and use Tesla as an ice breaker... Again and again. There's no right or wrong way to invest or else the stock market wouldn't go up or down. For my own investing and retirement portfolio I'm basically 10% hand picked stocks and 90% index funds. Therefore, I'm not seeing nearly as big of rewards, or losses, as a lot of people on here. Since those safer stock market investments are my bread and butter it's easier to see why I can be more skeptical of the higher-end bull case for Tesla.

My biggest area of discomfort with Tesla is I don't think they're earnings growth will come consistently. I realize that sounds silly because that's completely expected with companies earlier on as opposed to an established giant like Microsoft or Amazon that I'm much more comfortable with. However, where it makes me uncomfortable is paying the super high premium now as if they are a giant in hopes of those big future returns. If it doesn't pan out then it could be a bad situation. Everyone knows that, but for some reason some people get angry about it as if they know the future and argue on reddit. Until they expand outside the realm of being an automobile company I struggle to see big earnings growth since it's such a low profit margin business. That said, eventually, in 2-4 years or whenever they do release their next big thing then earnings can start to grow rapidly again. We'll just have to all sit back and see if they bring something novel to the table or if they have competition. If the price doesn't jump up a lot before then maybe I'll hop on board."

I think converting cars to LPG or CNG like they do in poor countries is a better solution if you want cheap fuel and low pollution.

And Tesla Atopilot which uses cameras only? That is a very bad idea to risk lives like that. If a camera is dirty it won't work. If it is dark, or snow or dirty roads it won't work.

I do get pissed off by people who just look at the stock price performance over the last year and a half or the P/E ratio or compare to other auto companies and categorize Tesla as overvalued. It’s intellectually lazy, and it is said often enough that it can become a default consensus that IMO does not match reality and obviously lacks nuance.

Like I said, my own bearish case puts Tesla at $615/share in 2025 ($12 billion profit on $133 billion revenue), and it includes an assumption that their global EV market share is cut in half from 23.5% to 12.5%, and that Tesla only manages to grow revenue at a 33% CAGR rather than the 50% that they guided for, all while diluting the share price 5% per year and operating expenses grow at 25% CAGR. So if Tesla goes below $400/share, I will be buying more hand over fist, and if it goes above $1000, I will be selling based on my valuation absent any material long term changes.

Your not even making any points of the headroom that they could grow and not responded to my points. Btw i own like half a share of Tesla so i dont think they’re gonna fail but I’m telling you the reality."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Actually the Solar Roof is not Chinese sourced PV

They are produced in GigaNewYork - like I said Tesla is not the only US solar producer, 

Is their non solar roof PV cells chines sourced. Yes of course.

Edit: you have links regarding the old product. V3 tiles now exist. And one link was from June of last year. 

Have you the 2021 updated explanation list. Stay up to date my friend"
03/23/2021,stocks,"Because math. I'm done. You can't be convinced or reasoned with because you refuse to think.

That's not my problem. Nysoz gets it."
03/23/2021,stocks,Haha so you're comparing a Tesla to the an ICE? Okay that's already super bias. EV will be more popular than ICE in 15 years. So currently sure 1%. But it's 79% of the plug in electric vehicle sales. Model 3 is the most sold EV in the world. I don't think you're correct.
03/23/2021,stocks,The internet industry was known for 2 decades and wasn't even close to how it was today. Google had to start somewhere. So does Tesla and there exponential growth is still coming.
03/23/2021,stocks,You're negating growth far too much for this conversation. Farewell and have a great life ✌
03/23/2021,stocks,"Honestly your point is so miscued. We're comparing apples to oranges. Both are fruit that grow from trees. Are they the same absolutely not, are they both big names in their industry sure are."
03/23/2021,stocks,"They are because Tesla hasn’t been able to make shit worth reporting, zero numbers out there about the sales regarding V3.

But again $750 mil in revenue for all of the energy division.

https://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/politics/albany/2020/02/26/panasonic-drops-role-buffalo-solar-plant-tesla/4879049002/

There is zero issue with my links. Do you think the business case for Tesla magically changed in the last year?"
03/23/2021,stocks,"I am here arguing with you because I am actually thinking. You are frustrated because I am giving you proof that not everyone is or believes in Tesla. 

You are agitated and are simply trying to end it by saying you are done. But in reality you know that there are people like me and you know not everything you think is going to happen will happen. 

If you have been blindly convinced that other car manufacturers cannot or will not catch up to Tesla that is delusional. You only need to look at history. 

And even if you think the collective if all car companies are not smart enough to catch up, then what about all the other tech companies?

They have way more money than most companies. Take Apple for instance. A company with indisputable brand loyalty, an extremely successful business and the worlds most valuable company. They are getting into the car business. You have no idea what they will come up with. They shocked everyone with their in house M1 chip, who is to say their cars won't leave everyone else in the dust??

This is just the tip of the iceberg of the stuff you don't know. Now I don't know why you care about Tesla so much unless Elon personally saved your life. So maybe you made some money on Tesla, congrats. But you really need to stop being delusional. I had no idea mental illness and obsession could take the form of a company. Like why do you care so much about it honestly? Get a life bro"
03/23/2021,stocks,"I'm comparing it to the rest of the market it competes in... The automobile industry... As in if they are going to gain sales they are going to have to take those sales away from the other automobile manufacturers... So far they have taken about 1%...

0.8% to be exact:

https://www.torquenews.com/1083/here-s-what-tesla-s-current-market-share-looks-globally-us-china-and-europe

And your % share of EV sales is not even close... Last year Tesla had 18%... This year projected at 12...

Next time you tell someone to do some research you might want to have the first clue what you are talking about."
03/23/2021,stocks,Tbh i dont even know why im trying to help you.
03/23/2021,stocks,"> apples to oranges

But you can still compare them."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Ok well i was using amazon as a point of reference, you havent gave any stats of what growth could Tesla have as you keep saying they have huge growth ahead"
03/23/2021,stocks,"It has actually. The Denver area alone has large waiting lists for customers. They can’t train installers fast enough.

We just getting started on the sales my guy."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Haha every article you posted is backed by an article stating its going to increase. You're really bias. This is the beginning, of course it's minimal currently. Every giant has to start somewhere. This is autonomy, electric powered green energy. Tesla has exponential growth. You watch."
03/23/2021,stocks,I don't own Tesla or Amazon so I have no idea why you have such a hard on right now haha
03/23/2021,stocks,"Not when this thread was ""are they both fruit"" that's how this started XD"
03/23/2021,stocks,"It's pretty obvious. ICE companies are far to late to the game, Teslas going to take a massive piece of pie while they catch up. Super simple. Expanding into other continents, once Electricity is charged like gasoline things will change. The insurance will happen whether that's NA SA Asian it will happen."
03/23/2021,stocks,Well hopefully these ones don’t catch on fire and take months to install too!
03/23/2021,stocks,Sure thing fanboy
03/23/2021,stocks,Whatever you say boss
03/23/2021,stocks,"Like I said. You haven’t been paying attention. 

3-4 days installation depending on size of house."
03/23/2021,stocks,;) what's wrong with that?
03/23/2021,stocks,"Like I said before, it doesn’t matter considering how small the business is.

Elon wants it that way too, at least until after the lawsuit and federal investigation stops."
2021-03-22 21:07:55,stocks,"What cause of a U.S. stock market crash would you hesitate to buy (if any)? Alien Invasion? Reptilian takeover? EMP strike? Incoming astroid strike? Nuclear war?

With all the ""buy the dip"" attitude I gotta know when I should hesitate (if ever).

I'd imagine there were people who would say a global pandemic would be a reason to hesitate but that turned out to be false. If a virus is wiping out a percentage of the world we buy TESLA!"
03/23/2021,stocks,"I reckon the last 12 months have been an extremely bullish moment in recent memory. Cherry on top is meme stocks like TSLA and GME at ridiculous pe ratios, Bitcoin at 60k. Symptoms of market euphoria. Will this continue? maybe, maybe not."
2021-03-22 21:04:13,stocks,"AT&T - Juiced the dividend this quarter by $0.3493 Following advice on this forum I initiated a variation on the selling of covered calls on the AT&T stock I own to juice the income above what the stock earns in dividends.

&#x200B;

My strategy is when the AT&T dividends are paid into my account I buy more AT&T stock with the cash then sell covered calls against all my AT&T stock that expires the week before earnings.

&#x200B;

Doing this on 2/1 I was able to buy more AT&T shares at $28.79 and sell ""T Apr 16 2021 CALL 31.0"" for $0.49 which is near what the dividend is. If the stock would have been called at $31 I would have made $2.21 a share gain and pocketed the $0.49 for the call.

&#x200B;

As of today with the earnings call happening on 4/22, the dividend date announcement happening soon and the ex-dividend date in early April I decided to close my covered calls at $0.11.

&#x200B;

I netted $3423.56 in gains on the covered call options or $0.3493 per share.

&#x200B;

Adding the $0.52 dividend to the $0.3493 will give me 0.8693 of income for my 9800 shares of AT&T this quarter which is a 3% return or 12% annually.

&#x200B;

I plan to do this again at the beginning of May when the dividend is again paid."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Well done T is a dividend aristocrat that is doing alot of 5G roll out infrastructure and dropping fiber everywhere in the US. DirecTV seems to be in the rear view or a situation where only positive outcomes will be a result now. 

Smart to hold the dividend income for the subsequent drop after earnings. Everyone here has noted the price is stable but a few pennies compounded over time add up quickly.

I hold as does my son's custodial."
03/23/2021,stocks,I can't put money into a company that intentionally decreased a quarterly projection just to show the market that it beat expectations to pump the stock price
03/23/2021,stocks,"I’ve been looking into more dividend stocks, with how red hot housing is I’m probably going to put my whole down payment back into the market, but in mostly blue chips that pay a decent dividend. 

My wife is admittedly not super keen on this, because we do want to buy a house within a year or two, and the thought of losing it all in a crash is very worrying."
03/23/2021,stocks,Damn. On T I'd be worried about having shares called away.
03/23/2021,stocks,"That happened with me with US West, a telecom company that covers the middwest and parts of west coast. Had my IRA invested in them, thinking they were solid. One day I check the paper (before internet, stock prices were listed in the papers, kids) and the stock dropped from $41 to $11. I couldn't believe my eyes and almost had a heart attack. They restated their earnings for the past two years from gains to losses. Sure, there was some class action suit following, but it amounted to nothing in payback. Sooo, lesson here, what this man said can happen again."
03/23/2021,stocks,Gonna be $40 in 6 months.
03/23/2021,stocks,I’m in the same age bracket but have decided not to retire until 70. I also own T and reinvest the dividends nothing can beat compounding. I also have  some speculative positions and frequently trade derivatives.
03/23/2021,stocks,"You can set the strike price higher. As mentioned in my post I am doing a derivative of what others are doing with covered calls on T. The articles are posted here and on SA.

&#x200B;

What they are doing is selling covered calls with a strike price of $35 with a 30-45 day expiration. They pocket a lot lower premium by doing this but have not had their shares called away.

&#x200B;

In my post I stated that I closed my position (covered calls) at $0.11 because I felt that the premium of only $0.11 was not worth the exposure of the T only being $1 off the strike price with the ex-dividend date coming in early April but I still pocketed the $0.38 for the seven weeks."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Sorry that happened to you. I think it is probably a lot worse back then because today it's probably easier to get out with online trading and more research available.

I cannot imagine how much of a gut punch that must have been opening the paper."
03/23/2021,stocks,I do it all the time in mine.
03/23/2021,stocks,"Yeah, if you can get it. Brokerage houses keep the best IPOs for their top customers. I believe Starlink would make a lot of money and kick T in the teeth. I guess the best play would be to buy puts on T when Starlink launches."
03/23/2021,stocks,"It was only about 10K, but still, you feel violated."
03/23/2021,stocks,Because it’s allowed. Just can’t do it on margin.
03/23/2021,stocks,"Starlink is ONLY internet access (for remote areas) somehow I don't see it affecting T in any significant way. Please tell me how Starlink competes with WarnerMedia, HBO Max?"
03/23/2021,stocks,"Yes, just sell short period calls with high strike price. A small dividend with a low change stock is like a dividend."
03/23/2021,stocks,Yeah. Anytime you lose 75% of your investment it hurts. Especially when it's supposed to be a safe one.
03/23/2021,stocks,With Netflix - you can download your movies instead of subscribing to a channel.
03/23/2021,stocks,"Starlink is internet access for the entire planet Earth with none of the traditional heavy duty infrastructure that ATT, Verizon, have to upkeep. 

They are going to eat all the other ISP’s lunches and take their customers over the next few decades."
03/23/2021,stocks,T's dividend is so high that it is sort of like owning a REIT.
2021-03-22 21:03:48,stocks,"What broker are you guys using? Hi everyone. I’m looking for a reliable broker to invest in but haven’t found one yet. One of my friends who used to trade warned me about brokers taking your money without you even knowing. So, I want to find a good, legit broker and’d love it if you guys can suggest me one. Thanks!"
03/23/2021,stocks,I bank with Bank of America so I use Merill Edge for both my regular brokerage and my Roth IRA. I know they don't have the best rep or the most popularity but I love the convenience of instant transfer between my accounts as well as being a preferred rewards member
03/23/2021,stocks,"I’m with Merrill too! It doesn’t get enough credit with the pop culture groups, but its solid.

One thing they do, every brokerage needs to do, is they display ‘cumulative investment returns’ on ETFs and mutual funds.  This takes into account reinvestment that dilute the unrealized gains, as well takes into account gains from dividends.

I find many have no idea how much value funds or stocks with dividends are really making them without this type of feature.

There comparative performance graph to compare whatever you do in your accounts to benchmarks is among the best. It makes it easy to stay honest with yourself with how well you’re doing in the long term.

Some platforms simplify things with a sleekness, but that doesn’t mean it displays all of the information."
03/23/2021,stocks,"I like merill. I like how they calculate my own Cumulative returns as well. However, I wish they would display what percentage of my portfolio is in each stock I own like many other brokerages"
03/23/2021,stocks,"I know what you mean. They don't make that easy. That isn't daily information I need, but you can get to it 3 separate ways:

1) Under your holdings view if you separate by account an option becomes available to create a 'customized view.' One of the options of the customized view is the % of your total portfolio your holdings are. The one bad spot is if you own QQQ in 3 separate accounts out of 3, you would need to look for it in each separate account and add together. This is the closest view to what you're use to.

2) You can get the information through the portfolio X-Ray

3) This is nifty feature, but overly graphical for what it needs to be, use the 'portfolio story' and go to allocations and click on the bubble of the company your interested in. I go to this, because it shows me what percent is included in ETF funds. It helps me see just how much APPL is bought by ETFs in my portfolio these days."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Ok, thanks"
2021-03-22 20:46:44,stocks,"SHLX alternative I was looking to buy SHLX but it's not available on Revolut so, What alternatives are out there that have similar product, high dividend yield and a steady income as a company? (Like contracts that still have years until they expire?)."
2021-03-22 20:22:33,stocks,"Is there any way to get perpetual a price alert for a stock at a certain number in yahoo finance, or do i have to go elsewhere? In Yahoo Finance on iphone, any time my price alert for a stock is executed, it is removed from the active alerts list. I would like to not have it expire, and to instead keep getting a notification whenever the price is hit. I have tried poking around in the app and cannot find a setting for this in any obvious place. Is this not possible with Yahoo? If not, can anyone recommend another app for iphone that can do this for me? Thank you."

It seems to sit around $8.50 now, with movement between 8-9, but I can't seem to find any real catalyst to it's sudden spike in December, then crash 2 months later.

03/23/2021,stocks,But how to measure or rate this “goodwill”?
03/23/2021,stocks,It is one of the most important things that show customer loyalty which implies the company will last for long.
03/23/2021,stocks,that depends on the GAAP or IFRS rules for accounting
03/23/2021,stocks,That’s just marketing propaganda that marketing agencies sell to their clients. It’s useless for fundamental analysis. It’s why marketers get useless arts degrees.
03/23/2021,stocks,"Cyber is correct. 

Net Promoter Scores and JP Power ratings are not correlated to the movement in a stock price.

It may be an indicator to help you understand what's going on, but it isn't a driver."
03/23/2021,stocks,"There is a difference between Marketing, advertising and branding. It is super useful for fundamental analysis. A bigger brand value is similar to having a higher moat and making it difficult for competition beat. It also leads to higher profit margins. And much more."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Net promoter score and JP power ratings are corresponding to brand value? What’s the same scores for Apple, Tesla, Amazon? 
Brand value is a symbol of trust and loyalty among customers."
03/23/2021,stocks,Margin is already taken into account for FA. Bigger brand value can be taken into account when describing the premium in P/E compared to sector. Higher moat for competition purely on brand? Debatable.
03/23/2021,stocks,Who said “purely” on brand? Higher brand value is one of the important factors that contribute to moat. There are several other factors too.
03/23/2021,stocks,"In these times i would personally, never invest that 35k in one day, or one week. Just saying. 

Voo is nice."

03/23/2021,stocks,Are the Schwab funds equivalent?
03/23/2021,stocks,Can't go wrong with VTI.
03/23/2021,stocks,Yeah just put the other 50% in DOO
03/23/2021,stocks,Add some arkk
03/23/2021,stocks,Bro that’s the s&p500. Prob the safest overall investment u can make long term. Unless u think America is gonna die. 🤷‍♂️
03/23/2021,stocks,As long as you keep contributing monthly to VOO or VTI you have a sound retirement fund
03/23/2021,stocks,You should dollar cost it in. Next 3 months make be up and down down down
03/23/2021,stocks,Is VOO safer than VTI?
03/23/2021,stocks,More like 98%.
03/23/2021,stocks,Vfiax and you don’t have to wait.
03/23/2021,stocks,"Interesting.  How do you mean? Like one etf with vanguard,  one with fidelity etc ? I mean how different could those etfs be ? They are liking picking from the same 500 companies mostly."
03/23/2021,stocks,did you just reveal to us that 50% of your portfolio is $344k USD?
03/23/2021,stocks,I mean....
03/23/2021,stocks,Inflation slowly eats the value of your cash.
03/23/2021,stocks,"Slightly, yes, since VTI also includes smaller companies which tend to be riskier. However smaller companies also can offer higher returns."
03/23/2021,stocks,"To add onto the other post, they're like 99% correlated. vti is like 80% voo /  20% small and mid cap stocks which are also very highly correlated to voo, so it's going to be almost identical. I do prefer vti though."
03/23/2021,stocks,"I happened to look at past performance of some different ETFs this morning and found that with dividends reinvested, VTI beat SPY (and presumably VOO) over most time periods (from five years ago through 25 years ago, and every five-year increment in between). Not that it was a significant difference, but if you're on the fence as to which one to choose, this could help decide."
03/23/2021,stocks,20% NOK at 5.50
03/23/2021,stocks,"ETFs can focus on a lot of different investment strategies. Some offer a higher risk/profit portfolio, some focus on bonds and not stocks, some are heavily options. Etc. like. Even if the only ETF that existed was the S&P 500 trackers I’d still diversify into ETFs with different weights. Though, yea I also suggest keeping multiple accounts with multiple people"
03/23/2021,stocks,"It’s not a big deal.  I’m just a stranger on the internet, not like I’m revealing this information to anyone I know in real life lol."
03/23/2021,stocks,"This! Noone! Ever!  


If only there is a 20y call for VOO or SPY."
03/23/2021,stocks,"That’s the key, long term hold"
03/23/2021,stocks,"That and the fact that I could buy more of it at the time were the reason I went with VTI. Can't always afford to buy 1 VOO a month, but I can usually afford VTI"
03/23/2021,stocks,God bless the people who bought my shares I got at under ipo price.
03/23/2021,stocks,you've just put a target on your back
03/23/2021,stocks,That thing would have insane IV. 4% annualized returns ≠ guaranteed 4% annual price increase
03/23/2021,stocks,"Who are you using that doesn't support fractional shares these days? Also, if share price is a concern, check out $SFY. Not much volume and not a perfect match to SPY/VOO, but if you can't buy fractional shares, this could help you squeeze more of your cash into investments."
03/23/2021,stocks,Thanks!
03/23/2021,stocks,"They don’t rebalance it to capture the best returns, they just keep it at market cap weighting. It doesn’t really require any rebalancing at all."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Etrade, if anyone knows how/if you can buy fractional shares with them please enlighten me. The only fractional shares I get are through DRIP."
03/23/2021,stocks,No they have not.... by a long shot.
03/23/2021,stocks,"After a quick search it looks like your understanding is correct. E-Trade will give you fractional shares through DRIP, and apparently you can sell fractional shares, but you cannot buy them directly. Mutual funds could be another way around that problem, but those can be a bit different (in particular, you can't take advantage of intraday prices). Moving to another platform is obviously also an option, but I'm guessing you're well-aware of that."
03/23/2021,stocks,"I am, but I'm very happy with etrade so far (except for the fractional shares thing. I will probably switch someday."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Sheesh this stock really only goes down. Been drilling for weeks with no bounce in sight. 

Hopefully they crush earnings, I'm holding a bag."
03/23/2021,stocks,Why would you sell now but hold through the 40s? Your logic is irrational. Can you please elaborate? Thanks!
03/23/2021,stocks,"I sold most in high 30s. Kept 1k shares. I see the market shifting back to HMO control. Telehealth will continue, but likely run on large EMR platforms such as Cerner and Epic. The HMOs employees can do the telehealth.  

Current state reminds me of EMR software in the late 90s where everyone created their own, eventually all was consolidated into a few big players. This has already started to happen with teleheath.  

Fragmentation is one of the biggest challenges in Healthcare. Big players will/are lobby for standard EMR. This will further disadvantage small players.

Will Amwell survive, maybe. Best outcome may be merger.  

Walmart and Amazon are looming large.

Lastly, most of the people (physicians) who actually make the money, are 1099  remote workers. There is zero loyalty to the company who has continued to lower reimbursement. In addition, like all remote workers, now a lot harder for geographic incentive/manipulation i.e. can easily change jobs without worrying about moving kids in school. 

Bottom line. I do not think small players will survive. I hope AMWL has great earnings, will use new data to reevaluate my position.

03/23/2021,stocks,I got 100 shares at like $10.20...I’m living 😎
03/23/2021,stocks,This is my thinking too. Test the thesis and add more if it is proving itself. Bit in my initial at $12.69
03/23/2021,stocks,"Nice; keep picking up the dividends..... a lot better than any CD

Also look at an under valued under-the radar potential blue chip pharma, VTRS, which will start paying a close to 4pct div in Q2 as a start. Merger of Pfizer's UpJohn business into Mylan Labs. Some time you or someone in your family has used one or more of the products. [https://www.viatris.com/en/Products/Brands](https://www.viatris.com/en/Products/Brands)"

03/23/2021,stocks,And Facebook already has some pretty horrifying statistics involving predators.
03/23/2021,stocks,"Ipo’s can be a risky game . Example I bought 100 Lyft shares during IPO for $76, price tanked within 11 days. Here’s the kicker if you buy IPO shares at Fidelity and sell in the first 11 days you can’t qualify to purchase another IPO for 6 months. So long story short I lost about 50% of my investment. It makes more sense to wait a couple weeks to see what the IPO is going to do. If it’s a winner than you buy shares on the open market and enjoy the ride."
03/23/2021,stocks,It's Chinese  with to much debt and not enough profit + it's 3x in 12 months
03/23/2021,stocks,"How does it being Chinese negatively affect it though? Is cooking the books a big issue with companies from China? I did notice that their debt is high, but if they're profitable right now, despite the lack of widespread use of solar panels, what's to say they won't be able to clear all that debt in the next 5 years."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Yes the main reasons are them cooking the books and there government compete control,  they can easily close a business down or force them to run there business in a way that benefits the government over the share holders  

Just today the Chinese government has banned all there police army and office staff from driving or parking there teslas on goverment owned land like goverment office government housing also any army staff can not park there tesla at home  dew to teslas car camera maybe spying on China 

When you got shit like that going on along with a trade war it's dangers to invest in china if your not Chinese and live there. 

A portfolio needs to be balanced some USA some uk /eu  and some Chinese  I would not put more than 15% of my total in china and only invest in the big names like nio Alibaba jd.com 

China will be the next world power very soon so you don't won't to be left out but you don't won't to be to heavy at the same time imo 

They probably will get there debt down in the next few years the problem is right now the whole world markets are cooked there at all time highs at the same time the €£$ are all broken and the is covid that is killing the GDP of every country in the world 

When the stock market next claps happens the stocks that have no cash reserves,  big debt, low profits,  high pe ratios are the first stocks to go down big and fast 

Imo now is a good time to be invested on good solid company's that are low risk that I expect to be up in the next 3 to 5 years like fb, Pfizer, wba, tattooed chef,  and maybe jd.com for my Chinese stock  

But if you buy the sola panel stock you will be ok if you dca it over the next 3 years or if you hold 30% cash to buy it when it drops big time in a receshion but if your new to investing when you see your portfolio dropping 10% a week for 5 weeks on the run you will shit out and sell at a 50% loss when the cleverest investers are buying at a 50% discount 

Don't get burned as the market could drop 80% I  the next 60 days for all we know and could take 10 years to recove"
03/23/2021,stocks,P/E ratio. Add that to your analysis and you’ll understand why the prediction is highly unlikely.
03/23/2021,stocks,"I am not doing analysis.  Traditional analysis does not matter when the P/E is 300+. The stock has destroyed traditional analysis.

Whether that continues to happen...i have no idea.  I don't care either. But it is possible if similar trends continue.

Everyone doing analysis on Tesla for the last couple years missed out on 600%, 700%, 800% increase in price. I could really care less about it for this stock until it comes down to earth."
03/23/2021,stocks,could the issue be concern over a potential biden administration overhaul on the laws regulating the industry?
03/23/2021,stocks,I think we might be in the early stages of huge advancements in pharma. I chose BMY because Cathie Wood had some at one point and it seemed cheap. My opinion in the next 5 years pharma will out perform
03/23/2021,stocks,"Same stock holdings, less VTRS, I buy a few shares of each every month, not planning on selling. Healthcare between pharma, med tech, REITs, managed care, telehealth, biotech makes up +/-35% of my portfolio. I work in healthcare and see most of this as safe income at the least with upside for many stocks like SEM, CVS, TDOC, HIMS, ONEM, HEC/Talkspace, VGAC/23andme etc etc"
03/23/2021,stocks,I bought every company in the diabetes space I could find.  I know two people with covid19 that struggled with getting their type II Diabetes back under control after covid.

03/23/2021,stocks,Never gonna happen.

03/23/2021,stocks,"Nah a big pfe patent expired 2 yrs ago and the next two  big ones aren’t until 2025 and 2026. Plenty of time for one of their ~25 phase 3 drugs to step up.

03/23/2021,stocks,"english isnt my first language . I didnt know its the same spelling as it is in german . Regulations would still mean less profits . Im not saying or ever implied their profits would go to zero , but metrics like P/E would increase ."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Neither is it mine, but that's besides the point. You can't just spin the wheel and select a random product and say ""Just wait till this regulation hits, it's super risky to invest in biotech!"" We live longer and longer, and the need for pharmaceuticals is just increasing. If anything, I'd say the sector itself is positioned favorably for the future. New therapies are coming out every year, which just broadens company portfolios. I think you're viewing this from a very narrow angle."
03/23/2021,stocks,MSFT at 15 P/E is not a value play? You must be a dividend investor.
03/23/2021,stocks,I think you misunderstood my comment. I was correcting someone’s false statement. MSFT back then trading at a 15 PE and based in its growth was definitely a value GARP play.

03/23/2021,stocks,EV - I’m taking the gamble with VW
03/23/2021,stocks,"Cognex: involved in computer vision and automated manufacturing, also makes semi-conductors.  Apple is their biggest client.  Don't know why I don't see this mentioned ever but it's been one of my best performing long term holds over the last few years.  

Bee Vectoring Technologies: low cap moonshot aiming to disrupt the pesticide industry with an environmentally friendly bee-based alternative.  The product is already in use.  It'll take a couple seasons for us to see concrete results but farmers are at the very least interested enough to try it and they've broken into several important markets.  If they can capture even a small portion of the total market cap of the pesticide industry this'll be a big winner.  

Volkswagen: mostly just because I'd want at least some exposure to the ev space in this hypothetical and I see TSLA as overvalued and due for a hard correction soon, where vw is more or less a safe bet even discounting their ev plays."
03/23/2021,stocks,Tesla palantir [insert one here]
03/23/2021,stocks,"Don't come @me but I have 2.
Amazon and Tesla.

Here's why......
Amazon is getting into markets that are making it easier on bigger segments of populations like Boomers and Gen X.
I hate to have to get out and go shopping.  Most of my shopping is done online but I have to use multiple sites to get what I need.
Amazon is starting to get into smaller populated cities with their supermarkets and pharmacy services so I can see them cornering the market if they continue reaching more communities.
I feel it's only a matter of time that Amazon will get into the automotive and real estate markets.
How easy would it be to pull up 1 site to look for a particular automobile and see how much that vehicle would cost from different sellers?  No more running around town trying to find the best deal because it's right in front of you.
Same with housing.
Pipe dream?  Maybe.  But it would make sense because we have millions of people aging out of the ability to physically spend a day out making purchases but are tech savvy.
One stop shopping should be the future.

My view on Tesla is pretty much in line with the way everyone else who chooses it so I dont feel the need for a. Explanation."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Apple will go under, their innovations are dry as fuck last 5 years"

03/23/2021,stocks,That's correct 😊
03/23/2021,stocks,Without a doubt but it's safer than individual stocks Which are higher risks
03/23/2021,stocks,I’m betting big on SoFi too.  Just need the merger to complete so the ticker will change.  They are the bank for the 30 and under crowd.  Once you get into their ecosystem; you don’t get out.

03/23/2021,stocks,It’s still innovation. They’re making thinner phones with larger batteries by removing things like headphone jacks.
03/23/2021,stocks,"That's not innovating though. That's just Apple copying Android manufacturers. 

Disclaimer: I ~~owe~~ own 375 Apple shares."
03/23/2021,stocks,"True that. Their $5,000 monitor that doesn’t come with a stand is one of my favorite ways they innovated. 

Before, I always thought a monitor should come with a stand ya know? Cheap $60 ones up to $500 ones all come with stands. So I figured a $5,000 6k monitor would come with one and it blew my mind it doesn’t. And the stand when purchased from Apple is another $1000"

03/23/2021,stocks,I'm in science and in the same boat as you. Clearly crispr is going get bigger but it's not possible to know which company will win in the space.
03/23/2021,stocks,"Why is that? Each company puts its drug pipeline on its website, and it’s easy to research the current literature on each drug in development on your own.

I agree that every gene editing stock is highly speculative, and that none of these companies will make real profits for at least half a decade given that the most developed drug is still in early phase 1/2. But your understanding of the field is definitely better than a financial analyst’s, so why would you trust ARK over yourself?"
03/23/2021,stocks,Well at least you know to avoid scams like Theranos
03/23/2021,stocks,"Ask jeeves did have google, yahoo, and bing up against them now look. Just like DropBox now is up against Google Drive and OneDrive. Two services that are way easier and more popular to use. There's also literally a popular company named ""Box"" competing against them."
03/23/2021,stocks,What does iCloud have to do with Dropbox?  Each of the big tech have a similar service to Dropbox.  That’s it’s biggest competitors
03/23/2021,stocks,"No, but some customers like myself are willing to sacrifice those small conveniences for a better user interface."
03/23/2021,stocks,"""we""? Ha, I think not."
03/23/2021,stocks,"I guess being in research I've seen how a lot of confident people and projects can sound promising, but underneath it all it's going nowhere. I don't trust what I read on their websites, because we can all make something sound amazing to both scientists and non-scientists alike.

I was going to split my investment across five companies, but decided it would be probably equally as good to just let a fund handle that one. I figured if I had $1000 in a company that takes off (while the other $4000 goes nowhere), I might as well just have $5000 in a fund."
03/23/2021,stocks,Box doesn't do 500 million per quarter. Ask Jeeves did not compete for 10 years.
03/23/2021,stocks,Because Dropbox is on Android as well as iCloud but iCloud is not on both therefore Dropbox has a corner of the market that iCloud cannot cover
03/23/2021,stocks,"Well, they were going bankrupt and Microsoft had to step in to bail them out."
03/23/2021,stocks,You really underestimate how great their user interface is. It’s intuitive and easy- exactly what a majority of customers are looking for.
03/23/2021,stocks,They all copy each other.
03/23/2021,stocks,"Is evaluating business fundamentals that important in evaluating a company that is still 100% in the research phase tho? 

Picking the best team only matters insofar as you can pick the team most likely to develop a working therapy (which someone in the field is likely more apt to judge than a financial analyst). Contracts matter secondarily I guess, but only insofar as they limit the degree a company can moon if a drug does get approved (eg vertex stake in several CRISPR therapies would somewhat limit potential CRISPR profits), or how much runway they have to research before bankruptcy. 

Imo picking a winner solely entails picking a company that develops a working therapy, regardless of anything else. Or picking one that almost does and then selling on the hype before it ultimately fails lol"
03/23/2021,stocks,"I meant using google scholar and pubmed to self research the drugs listed on their websites, but I get it- it’s a stab in the dark no matter who does it"
03/23/2021,stocks,Apple has been a status symbol forever
03/23/2021,stocks,"Again, it literally doesnt matter what you want. Apple’s surveying is statistically significant for millions. 

Maybe you have some overlap with their target demographic, maybe you don’t, but they’ve already profiled them head to toe.  Apple is perfectly happy to lose you as a customer if it means gaining 2 more elsewhere. 

I couldn’t see myself buying this shit either don’t get me wrong.  But it’s not for me either. And as an investor as long as I see Apple increasing consumer base and increasing average consumer value, that’s all that matters on that front 🤷‍♂️"

03/23/2021,stocks,I almost missed how your comment isn't innovation remotely.
03/23/2021,stocks,"Wow, I guess your memory is only 3 years long? I guess you also forgot that Samsung made their screens for quite some time. Much innovation."
03/23/2021,stocks,"You realise this is what you replied to?

>’exactly why Samsung waits for Apple to introduce a controversial change and then copies them a year later once they see the market trends."
03/23/2021,stocks,What are you talking about
03/23/2021,stocks,"Yes, i guess you don't understand that Apple has stolen most of Samsung's innovation over the years"
03/23/2021,stocks,I'm talking about how Samsung was able to innovate enough to get into a position to sell Apple their phone screens.
03/23/2021,stocks,"""2m dollars!!!! OHHHhhh nooo, whatever shall wee do that's sooooo much money"" XDDDDDDDDDD What a pathetic amount. Waste of legal fees and time"

It came with some funky cord that I had to go back to phone store and get the 110 wall plug in that the cord fit. Cost extra $30 and the trip back. I told the dude it was fucking stupid and if I had the time I’d exchange the phone for my old android I would, all because if the charger crap.

03/23/2021,stocks,"Fun Fact: As of Jan 1 2021 US Hospitals are supposed to disclose cash prices and negotiated insurance prices to customers in the web. But many didnt do it because the fine is $300/day and cheaper for hospitals to pay it instead.   
Cash prices are somewhat like 40%-60% of the sticker price."
03/23/2021,stocks,"All BEVs sold in Brazil have to come with a charger, so Tesla, if they even bother to ever set up a subsidiary to sell their cars in Brazil, will have to comply."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Umm... they do sell them with a charger.

I think it's only a level 1 charger (correct me if I'm wrong Tesla owners), but it's still a charger."

Samsung is going to do this soon.   And the note 10+ has super fast 45w charging, but only comes with 25w in box.   It's extra for the 45w."

[Inflation fears are creating buying opportunities in tech.](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/22/inflation-fears-creating-extraordinary-tech-opportunities-invesco.html) I continue to say we've seen the bottom of the recent inflation fears and are just in the frothy period of the news. While we may see some period of consolidation in tech due to the wild run up in 2020, the market will eventually go up again!"
03/23/2021,stocks,Thought on $ASML - still a BUY at $576?
03/23/2021,stocks,Biden tax hike plan announcing this week. Will see how bad it is.
03/23/2021,stocks,SIVB please recover tomorrow🙏
03/23/2021,stocks,"Are there any free websites that will let you just plug in tickers and do a common size statement analysis for you? Not that it's complicated, it just seems easy to automate."
03/23/2021,stocks,What you guys think of Viant technology? Should i put my money into it? Beat their EPS by 25%. They have a PE of 4.
03/23/2021,stocks,"Notice how it was basically reddit type stocks that have been manhandled the last 6 weeks? When will the pain end? lol.  Looking back, I should have traded NIO better, especially when it bounced off the long term uptrend line, but now I'm fucking up just the same even though it 'broke trend' to the upside yesterday, guess not really. :-p"
03/23/2021,stocks,"I think people are just not sure anymore what's going to happen overnight and how we are going to open the next day, so people sell in order to keep profits or their losses at low. Just a guess. I don't do that myself."
03/23/2021,stocks,I think vaccine uncertainty and inflation holding down movement in either direction

03/23/2021,stocks,"Look at the VIX, was down nearly 10%, that’s your answer why options were down across the board, even my 2year leaps lost around 5% with a flat day"
03/23/2021,stocks,"I'm not sure if this is the correct way to invest. But, this is what I'm starting to do right now as a fractional investor. I've basically targeted two companies that have dividends and I'm buying them every week no matter what in hopes it averages out in the long run. I felt like diversification wasn't getting me anywhere either.

I'm still relatively new and have no clue what I'm doing so I would suggest you seek someone who knows what they're talking about before you do the same."
03/23/2021,stocks,No one wants out when they know what the next leg up could look like.
03/23/2021,stocks,"A fundamental difference to me is that it's not a stock so it's not going to be bothered by inflation/bonds, btc doesn't need to borrow money for operations. If anything inflation makes it a more attractive place to park money."
03/23/2021,stocks,"IRS isn’t going to get you for $10. 

Even if they sent you a notice you would just pay for that small amount. Highly doubtful tho."
03/23/2021,stocks,Wouldn't worry too much about it.
03/23/2021,stocks,"Love CVS. The place, don't know anything about the stock. Sounds like I should."
03/23/2021,stocks,"I like CVS, but hate my local CVS. Go figure."
03/23/2021,stocks,"I started buying a few CVS stock, then came to the realization I preferred Walgreens, and so I've shifted to WBA stock. Preferred as in that's the place I prefer to visit of the two, plus Walgreens has a better dividend, has an international presence, and their strategic partnerships.

I still have a very small number of CVS stocks, and will probably just hold them as I accumulate WBA.

I think both should do well out of the increase in traffic as a result of COVID vaccinations & boosters."
03/23/2021,stocks,My average is 30. It goes 10 percent under (27) I will buy more. Won’t stop you.
03/23/2021,stocks,Idk I sold Chevron Friday. Good riddance. All this rotation out of tech and into oil and shit. What a fuckin joke
03/23/2021,stocks,Spend it on strippers instead - better short term gains
03/23/2021,stocks,"Something related to NFTs, which I assume are going to be this year's equivalent to beanie babies, cabbage patch kids, or tickle-me elmo.

03/23/2021,stocks,"Same reason mining companies went sky high, and crashed. Hype. Hype sorrounding NFT."
03/23/2021,stocks,I sold 2/3 of my MOGO holding the past two days. Rebalanced to take profit and suit my risk tolerance. I hope the stock does well for you! (And me)

03/23/2021,stocks,"Jeez - that must be a lot of lost/found dog posts and bulk trash pickup notices to make up that valuation.

Not disputing whether it's worth that much. I just had no idea."
03/23/2021,stocks,Same!
03/23/2021,stocks,"Just buy it, China tech stock could have longer rotation cycles but they do catch up with their fundamentals over time, the trade war hurt them bad but they come back big time 2020. Hard to tell when they will come back but should be safe 100% gain after 5 years, or just get emqq."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Don't catch falling knives, and anything China related is a falling knife right now.

I think the tech indices may have made their bottom early this March for now, but China mostly got hit even harder than our tech indices and it doesn't seem as if it's over either."
03/23/2021,stocks,Question or instruction?
03/23/2021,stocks,Yep. Keep doing this. I feel good.
03/23/2021,stocks,lol no thanks
03/23/2021,stocks,"Care to share the other side, the more bearish side?"
03/23/2021,stocks,"Buy shares imo. If a crash or a bad luck happens, with shares its not dramatic, you wait it out and one day it will come back. With options, you lost everything. Quite the opposite, i think **selling** covered calls of shares you own can be a smart play."
03/23/2021,stocks,"TLRY operates in the Canadian market which is peanuts compared to the US, plus they will not get a US license if legalization ever happens here"
03/23/2021,stocks,"TA is one thing, i don't claim it doesn't work, but fundamentals are important too. With the covid cases and lockdowns soaring in europe, its not tempting to invest in travel stocks."
03/23/2021,stocks,"I admittedly don't trade regularly, but buying Boeing on Wednesday last week after the Dow and more cyclical sectors had been on absolute fire for a little while, and considering the tendencies from the Dow in this run it's been working on since early November (it has slowed down initially at every 1000 point jump higher before it goes higher)...that just seems like a poor risk/reward choice, even if the TA you do might have suggested that it was a good idea.

These kinds of stocks are likely going lower before they go higher again considering the tendencies from the Dow, and the better question is if whether the daily rotation can hide this in the overall market (it did today)."
03/23/2021,stocks,You tell me. Is it worth it getting $2 every 3 months with $200 invested?
03/23/2021,stocks,"This chart is very interesting.

03/23/2021,stocks,"Based on what? Increasing yields = increased mortgage rates = not great for growth stocks.


That being said, i don't think the yields can go a lot higher than 2%, so yea there is an end in sight."
03/23/2021,stocks,It was literally going up all of last week lol...
03/23/2021,stocks,Ur wack/weak

03/23/2021,stocks,You really think tomorrow will be that bad
03/23/2021,stocks,That’s why I invested in NKE. Went to the mall the other day and there was a 50 person line up to get into the store
03/23/2021,stocks,That's why I went all in on PLTR. I always start my mornings off by integrating my data.

03/23/2021,stocks,"I went full yolo - started buying at 4, bought every day for a month. Up to 4750 shares at 6.91 CB, with a 3-5 yr timeline. 

Taking profits the last couple days is a solid play if you’re not in for multiple years. When I started buying early feb, my “best case scenario” for 2021 was ending the year at $9/share, with 10-12 possible but not likely. Hitting those levels this month is premature imo - hence why your profit taking could likely be well-timed."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Second reply - for earnings tmw, I’m not at all interested in what the share price does. If top line revenue is close to (ideally above) CAD$10m, with net income close to CAD$1.5m, and encouraging news about the user base membership growth, I don’t care what the share price does. I’ll be a pig in shit and enjoying my slow ride to Mars."

03/23/2021,stocks,High five.
03/23/2021,stocks,Oh there's Chad's and Karen's no doubt. And they are using it but anyone will use it if you need to get a message out to your neighbors or if there is an emergency. I got a lot of good information about my house when I was evacuated during the California wildfires.

03/23/2021,stocks,"So, maybe 1-10k?"
03/23/2021,stocks,"Well that doesn't seem to be the case either though, because growth stocks fall even when bond yields fall. Makes me think that growth stocks could push lower. I feel like investment banks are looking for a cheap entry point to some of the more popular ones"
03/23/2021,stocks,This is the only reason I'm still in tech/growth. No one knows if that rotation will happen next week or at the end of the year.
03/23/2021,stocks,"If you're considering a slow grower like VTI, it probably won't make much of a difference if you invest this week or month since you can potentially be holding for a decade or more"
03/23/2021,stocks,Maybe it will pay off later this week
03/23/2021,stocks,"yeah but some are actually sort of decent companies like PTON or PLTR.  I mean you have your core meme stocks of AMC, BB, NOK, and of course GME, but then you have ones that are actually decent companies that just happen to get mentioned by 'the younger generation' of redditors."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Not necessarily. I learned about Palantir in the forum that shall not be named. After a week of research I quickly went in and out and 1.5x my money. 

Now Cathy wood is FOMOing into it waaay later"
03/23/2021,stocks,Not true. SHOP at $100 and SQ at $25 because of Reddit.
03/23/2021,stocks,I bought GME at $13.51 after seeing it on WSB in November.
03/23/2021,stocks,Ok the sentiment here changed my mind .
03/23/2021,stocks,I was amazed the first time I went into one to find you can buy alcohol there!
03/23/2021,stocks,They stopped selling cigarettes in 2014
03/23/2021,stocks,"I definitely see plenty of those sorts of adverts, and for the most part they're better tailored than Facebook advertising. There's also a marketplace they presumably take a cut from.

03/23/2021,stocks,"Nah, they get a blip of bad news every couple months but still rebound and trend up.  (opinion only) but I'm looking for them to achieve 80% their pre covid value by end of year.

There are other reasons for stocks to fall than just yields. That doesn't mean increasing yields are good for growth stocks."
03/23/2021,stocks,"I see thanks for explaining, that makes total sense then and something that would most likely also be true in the UK. My investment accounts are totally tax free and we are allowed to put about 30kusd a year in. So it would only affect my trading account  which I only day trade now anyway, good to bear in mind this potential pitfall!

I guess the solution is  a cash account for tax at Eoy and putting it aside and not reinvesting tax due - especially with such a huge gain - congratulations on that mate!"
03/23/2021,stocks,"That is debatable. Let's say i can invest for a 5% discount, this also means i get 5% more share. In 10 years, these 5% shares will be worth a lot."

03/23/2021,stocks,"Yeah that's true, but if we assume VTI is a relative slow grower and averages a healthy 10% growth per year, you wait a month and it's grown by 1%, then you could also just toss in 1% more into the initial investment if that's a trivial thing to do. 

The math for these percentages is not accurate, mind you, but I think it's healthy to be conscious of FOMO and realize that missing out on some discounts here or there shouldn't be a large deterrent. I think if you feel good about VTI at the price it's at now, then that's what you should be working off. If I wasn't confident about it now, then I could potentially be less confident about it if it's worth even more etc. (although this analogy probably works better for blue chip stocks because it's hard to judge the value of such a diverse fund)"

03/23/2021,stocks,"Enterprise value is what it would cost to buy the company so it's the market cap(stock price x all outstanding shares) + debt - cash.

Book value should be all of the company's asset minus debt.  It's the value the company has if it were to liquidate everything it has.  In AMC's case, its debt exceed its asset, so it has negative book value.  I don't know why it shows 0.18 for price/book.  I would expect it to show NA whenever a company has negative book value."

That's a good way to look at it. The ""day"" i waited today only lost me 1%.... The amount i wanted to invest is 12K... so that's actually only 120$ lol


Thanks, that does make me feel better.


I think i'll see how its going tomorrow and probably invest it at the end of the day hehe :)"
03/23/2021,stocks,"A 10% growth per year is more like a 20% growth year 1 + (-10%) growth year 2.

03/23/2021,stocks,"Ahh maybe, as far as I know though Nextdoor is used more in their respective communities because it's a free app, so you don't need a Ring subscription and I'm not even familiar with how Google approaches local neighborhood networks."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Yeah no problem. I also think it's not a bad idea to DCA in on a position. If you have mixed feelings about it, you can slowly pick up shares over the course of a month, for instance, which can give you more peace of mind if you're buying on a really green day (fearing it might dip) or a red day (fearing it might dip more). I think this is essentially what I'm doing anyway"
03/23/2021,stocks,"Facebook does it too though, they have facebook groups. I dont know its a wise investment. I feel like you gotta wait for their financial reports, Im betting they make negative money."
03/23/2021,stocks,"This is good advice. I'm definitely curious about what the numbers will be. FB for me though has its platform already set. For example, while FB has marketplace, I'm still going to ebay or Amazon first. Same for Nextdoor, if you want to know about something in the direct area you live you use Nextdoor. FB is too broad imo."

Should I have sold my GME stocks by now??"
03/23/2021,stocks,Fax
03/23/2021,stocks,Why RIP? I bought at 14 and want to get rid of it before it drops further. I thought it was solid and would continue to grow as Covid dissiupates
03/23/2021,stocks,I have 100 ABML as well. Might be good long term.
03/23/2021,stocks,because shares are hard to locate they paid $372 a share to either close out their short/close a transaction. Also happened in Feb where they paid i think close to $900 a share AH
03/23/2021,stocks,It dropped hard recently. Hopefully it builds back up
03/23/2021,stocks,I find it more ridiculous that a stock can be shorted more than 100%
03/23/2021,stocks,i did the same thing. i really want to lock in gains as I just started investing. Think it makes sense to sell (i bought it at 12) and then rebuy at 55?
03/23/2021,stocks,I bought one single lonely stock close to the top and I'm keeping it for ever. It has symbolic value
03/23/2021,stocks,Yes
03/23/2021,stocks,Those things wouldn't necessarily coincide with earnings though right?
03/23/2021,stocks,I see it as a dip! It has the potential to go downwards but given the pretty solid consolidation periods where eventually the stock broke the floor price upwards and continued to establish new floors in an upward trend.. I hope that routine doesn’t stop! We’ll only see with time but it’s possible it does continue and if it does people will look back and wish they got in at $12-14
03/23/2021,stocks,Hopefully you held onto it!
03/23/2021,stocks,I wondered the same thing. Is more stocks ever a good thing for current investors? in my experience the price takes a hit but I've only seen it once on a stock I owned.
03/23/2021,stocks,"No, but they certainly could."
03/23/2021,stocks,That makes sense. Expectations are high that it will rocket up after earnings. Should hopefully make tomorrow nice and green.
03/23/2021,stocks,Let's hope!!! If it drops below ten I'll likely sell at least half
03/23/2021,stocks,"i did and am thrilled. only thing is that I don't have a lot of money. I want to lock in gains at some point so I can use the profit to invest in. Not sure if to sell at a certain high point even though I realize it could, obviously, go higher. I mean it seem the rise is based on speculation than the solidity of the company. know what i mean?"

03/23/2021,stocks,"Just curious. Thinking on buying puts tomorrow on the morning surge. I think there's more potential downside to earnings than upside. Any good news on earnings is already priced in imo, in the sense that it's already overvalued. But poor earnings performance could cause more doubt."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Gotcha! Hopefully it doesn’t dip below $10, but tbh I’m a retarded gorilla and will be throwing in more money if it dips that low for sure! I got in initially at $14, bag held and averaged down for quite a while and now I’m sitting with a decent profit but I believe in a squeeze or higher stock price in the future. I’m sitting on it as a long term investment 👍🦍"
03/23/2021,stocks,"Maybe consider locking in your gains around the high tomorrow, if it drops again you can always re-buy"
03/23/2021,stocks,"It should be positive, there is a source in the UK reporting. It seems legit, but it’s not a huge increase. The positivity comes from what people believe is a catalyst. If earnings are positive, I can see a lot of apes buying shares out of FOMO. It could go in all sorts of directions"

I’m not knocking NASA, I just don’t think it’s impressive in the sense of entrepreneurial effort. NASA also struggled financially with their program in projects being too expensive. So it’s fair to say Space X is revolutionary to the space industry when it comes to cost, especially if the European Union is concerned their space program is going to lose jobs to Space X. 

You clearly are intelligent, I’m no dummy either. So it’s up to someone to filter through information and make their own decisions. 

Elon is doing something much bigger then what’s at face value. It isn’t some haphazard mosaic of ideas. 

This doesn’t diminish anything anyone else is doing."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Sell, take your tendies and move on. If you have to watch a screen 20x a day to feel confident in your investment then it is not worth the investment.

You shower them with affection and at the end of the day when you lay your head down to sleep you wonder if they are thinking of you the same way for weeks/months/ years? Not worth it."
03/23/2021,stocks,Yes
03/23/2021,stocks,"I am not offended by thoughts. But your thought is not well thought out. People join NASA not for the money but for the prestige of being part of a team that does extraordinary things. Ever  heard  of Velcro, that’s nasa . Tesla is a space trucking company and no more. They are not breaking boundaries but breaking price barriers for space exploration, which is good for the stock. By the time NASA reaches Europa and lands a probe into the oceans of that distant moon space x  will still be trucking satellites in to moons orbit....maybe. They are not ground braking at all. Will they improve or lives for the future...I hope so but there lies the intrinsic investment in a stock. Do you believe in their core goal and beliefs? That is what you have to ask yourself when investing. NASA’s budget is not infinite. They have fought tooth and nail for their budget. They needed to fight for every dollar they get in congressional approval. If Space X had the same constraints to budget then the outcome might be different. If you believe and do your DD then invest. If your going off of a cult of personality then good luck."
03/23/2021,stocks,"I understand your points. My comments were never to discredit NASA’s achievements. Yes Velcro, non-stick pans, grooves in cement on freeways etc etc. I do not believe these fall into the same category of comparison with what Tesla is doing. It’s like the movie Cool Runnings. Jamaica and bobsledding. That’s revolutionary because it just shouldn’t happen. Kinda like the Revolutionary war. We took on an empire that basically conquered the known world. We shouldn’t have won. For how expensive space travel it is revolutionary to lower the barrier to entry. 

The book Outliers touches on the idea that when someone is born around circumstances it elevates their opportunity and potential. Bill Gates being a prime example of having early access to computers for his age. 

NASA didn’t lower the cost of space travel, Space X did. And that is huge because the more expensive something is the longer it takes to progress. When the cost of computers went down the advancement of computers went up. 

Price and innovation are intimately connected. It’s not to say NASA didn’t change the world. I’m saying we need 10 NASA’s competing to drive price down and innovation up. And for Space X to drive the cost down at such a significant level is revolutionary. Space X is worthy of being appreciated just like the polio vaccine being free. What Elon brings to the table is the willingness to fail at all cost. That is a behavior we see in people like Kobe Bryant, Michael Jordan, Wayne Gretzky, Jerry Rice, LeBron James, etc etc. It’s not “win at all cost” because in order to win one must risk losing. To fear losing is to never explore ones full competitive potential. Elon has demonstrated he is willing to fail at the cost of losing greatly. 

America absorbs NASA’s failures. Who absorbs Elon’s? Elon. That is a character trait that is proven to be worth a long term investment. Elon is obsessed that even if he fails he will not quit till he is dead. It’s not even about the success to him, it’s about having a reason to wake up. I coach high level athletes and that attitude is what separates athlete performance. 

So it’s the mentality that I am investing in. Only because I understand it. For others that might be a dumb reason. It’s fine. NASA has highly competitive people and people who I would invest in, but I am unaware of NASA’s stock symbol."

I should've never listened to my dad, who at the time told me to diversify. It was my first stock purchase and I was going to put $5000 on it. Instead I ended up buying closer to $500 worth I think. I still have it and it's about $30,000 right now.

All the other stocks I chose rose as well (microsoft, ebay, penn, harrah's (forced to sell), and a few others, but if I'd put the whole $5k into aapl I'd probably have at least 1mil.

Didn't do the actual math for this post, but you get the idea. Should've gone with my gut on that one, oof.

Fun fact, I've since invested more over the years, and have still never sold a single stock (except the forced buyout of harrah's).

03/23/2021,stocks,But then what? Die and let your kids cash it in?
03/23/2021,stocks,"Traditionally, as you approach retirement age, you would begin selling your growth stocks (and most of your equities), using that money to invest in safer assets, like bonds, which you'd then draw an income from.

Alternatively, you could invest some of that into high yield stocks like REITs, but any dividend paying stock runs the risk of that dividend being cut during a financial crisis, like COVID or the 2008 financial collapse. And if you suddenly need a lot of money and the market is down, you may end up having to sell your stocks at a loss, whereas bonds help protect against that, since they usually work as a market hedge. 

Alternatively, you could hold your growth stocks in perpetuity and draw income by selling some of your profits, but again, if the market tanks for a few years right as you turn 70, you may end up eating into the principle. So it's all about assessing your risk tolerance, your age and expected income needs. 

For instance, assume I'll one day sell most of my equities and be in bonds and REITS. But I have 25 years ahead of me until retirement, so buying and holding potential high-growth equities like AAPL, MSFT, SPOT, etc, makes sense for me. For now. But if I get really lucky, maybe I can cash out a few in 10 years and start drawing income sooner. 

Anyway I hope that answers your question!"
03/23/2021,stocks,"Yes, if you invested every penny you had into CSCO and never sold, you'd not be very happy today. Similarly, if 90% of your portfolio is tied up in TSLA and that collapses, you will be very upset, especially if you plan on retiring in the next five to ten years. But that is exactly why you should always carefully assess your risk tolerance and invest and diversify accordingly. 

That being said, TSLA is where the comparisons to the dot com crash ends. AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN, ADBE, and other high-growth, high-profit companies like these nowhere near 1999 valuation levels. And while they can be seen as ""expensive"" by traditional valuation metrics like P/E, even brilliant value investors like Joel Greenblatt have conceded that  they are currently selling for a fair price, due to their unbelievable ability to generate free cash flow and ROI (etc). Not to mention their wide moats due to network effects, something Buffett himself, a huge AAPL holder, loves. 

So while you should never blindly hold your stocks forever — no one would ever advocate that — understanding the current macro and micro environment will greatly protect you from selling (or holding) unnecessarily."

03/23/2021,stocks,Yes but at the same time it’s expensive to have money sitting in a bank account burning a hole in your pocket. I personally think it’s good to force you to not have access to the money right now. You still have it in a dire emergency but it’s out of reach for hours/days which will nix out most impulse spending. I do agree on unavoidable life expenses. That can come up. I just think that unless you’re totally pressed on funds that you should do everything in your power to avoid touching investment money.

03/23/2021,stocks,"Yeah I understand why you misunderstood my underlying point. Regardless of what investing SHOULD be in our subjective minds, unexpected expenses come up throughout the course of life. So at the end of my comment I pointed out that capital gain taxes at income level (if taken before retirement from a retirement plan) are significantly higher dollar for dollar for middle class people than it is on high income people.

The highest marginal income tax rate that would be highest capital gains tax is low 30’s. Anything below that but above poverty level is in the 20’s. Do you understand what I was trying to say regarding those income taxes on capital gains? It’s disproportionately against middle class incomes."

03/23/2021,stocks,"Because there is no guarantee the stock price will rise and there is also little any individual employee can do to help it go up.

Imagine if a company gave everyone 10 shares of their currently priced $100/share stock - that's supposedly $1000 in benefits. But then in 10 years when the employee goes to cash out, the stock is only worth $65/share. The employee now feels ripped off, they were told they were being given $1000 in value but it ended up only being $650 (not even factoring in taxes yet). Sure, they would be even happier if the stock had gone up, but rather than risk it, most would rather just have a cash signing bonus or something like that, and if they want to invest it they can."

I'll split this DD valuation on Volkswagen into two parts: the Value Play and the Next Tesla Play.

VOW is the actual European stock ticker.  VWAGY is for American depository receipt equivalents at one-tenth of VOW.

[Meanwhile, PAH3 is the actual European stock ticker for parent company Porsche, while POAHY is for the American depository receipt equivalents at one-tenth of PAH3.]

**Value Play**

I can't provide the link to the article, but it is titled ""Volkswagen Is Undervalued And Is Perfectly Positioned For A Cyclical Upturn,"" written by ""The Value Analyst.""

I'll quote this part, though:

> Price to Sales remains at 0.66 and P/E remain at 10. For a company whose long-term growth potential is around 5-6% this stock is modestly priced. Although with similar growth rates many similar stocks trade at a much higher level. Cash flow tends to be a lot more volatile for VW and quite often in the negative due to capital expenditures. In general cash flow is not a good metric for vehicle manufacturers. The current ratio remains around 1.15, and that's quite good for a car maker.

> Overall, the state of finances remains solid, and there is certainly some value in the stock. A conservative DCF that assumes 8% WACC and 5% growth, with a terminal rate of 0%, shows the stock is likely valued at around $42.

Where I differ with that author, of course, is my position that a PT of $42 for VWAGY should apply *only* to Volkswagen's ICE and hybrid businesses.  Of the total auto sales of 9,305,400 units and €222.9 billion, the PT of $42 should apply *only* to 9,073,800 units and sales growth therein.

**Next Tesla Play**

Forget value investing.  Forget problems with being asset-heavy instead of being asset-light (i.e., as opposed to richly valued growth stories in the tech sector).

We want the next bubble play!  We want the Next Tesla!  We want tech valuations!  We want price-to-sales valuations!

[As of March 19, Tesla's price-to-sales ratio is 22.04.](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/tsla/tesla/price-sales)

Thus, let's scrutinize the 231,600 EV unit sales for 2020 and [Volkswagen's goal to become the consumer EV market leader by 2025](https://www.barrons.com/articles/this-is-how-long-it-takes-to-become-an-ev-player-51616075163).

The biggest non-Tesla pure play in the consumer EV space, NIO, sold over 43,700 units in 2020 for a [gross margin of 11.5%](https://ir.nio.com/news-events/news-releases/news-release-details/nio-inc-reports-unaudited-fourth-quarter-and-full-1).  As of March 19, its price-to-sales multiple is higher than Tesla's, at 26.60, despite not having the latter's cutting-edge battery technology or autonomous driving technology.

Not far behind are Li Auto and Xpeng, which sold approximately 30,000 units and 27,000 units in 2020, respectively.  Their respective gross margins were [16.4%](https://kr-asia.com/ev-maker-li-auto-generates-strong-profits-as-deliveries-surge) and [4.6%](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210308005328/en/XPeng-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-Year-2020-Unaudited-Financial-Results).  They trade at similar price-to-sales multiples despite lacking Tesla's cutting-edge battery technology or autonomous driving technology.

Even when combined, these claimants to ""second mover advantage"" sold far less consumer EV units than 231,600 units.  It is clear here that the real second mover is Volkswagen, not these pretenders.

Without further information, a *minimum* monetary estimate of Volkswagen EV revenues is €5.55 billion: €222.9 billion in total revenue x 231,600 EV unit sales / 9,305,400 total unit sales.  Since EVs are currently more expensive than less cleaner vehicles, their EV revenues should be noticeably greater.

Every bubble play has a price-to-sales multiple of at least 20.  Therefore, the consumer EV business of the Next Tesla, Volkswagen, Das Auto, should be worth *at least* €111.0 billion.

How much further should this EV-related market cap ""stonk""?

Well, [Volkswagen plans to sell 1 million EVs this very year!](https://www.barrons.com/articles/volkswagen-ev-goals-tesla-stock-51615901639)  If this is realistic, then the consumer EV sales could reach €23.95 billion.  Accordingly, the consumer EV business could be worth up to €479.1 billion.

**EV Economy Matters**

[The Next Tesla, Volkswagen, Das Auto, has big plans for fast charging and bidirectional charging.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-15/vw-plans-europe-s-biggest-battery-push-in-electric-offensive)

**Grossly Undervalued Like Yesterday**

As of March 19, VWAGY closed at a mere $34.15; Volkswagen's entire business has been valued at a mere €147.4 billion.  The upside to $42 strictly on the value play means that the market cap for Volkswagen's ICE and hybrid business should be €181.2 billion.

The EV top-up of €111.0 billion to €479.1 billion suggests that a more appropriate market value *as of yesterday* should have been €292.2 billion to €660.3 billion.

In other words, **VWAGY should have been trading between $67.70 and $152.98 yesterday, folks!**

The Next Tesla!  Volkswagen!  Das Auto!

Read your own links - I can guarantee all of them say you generally *don't* want the price to skyrocket, because if it does you would have made more money by just holding the shares. If you sell a call option that's OTM, you're ok with the price going up so long as it *doesn't* pass the strike price, because otherwise you would have made more money by just holding the shares. I don't understand why this is so difficult for you to comprehend, it's like you can't comprehend what an opportunity cost is. A covered call is a bearish strategy that you would take if your outlook on the stock is that it *won't increase past your strike*.

Look at your own link - the [""assignment is a success""](https://www.optionseducation.org/strategies/all-strategies/covered-call-buy-write) one. Here's a quote:

> Outlook The covered call writer is looking for a steady or slightly rising stock price for at least the term of the option. This strategy not appropriate for a very bearish or a very bullish investor.

Oh hey look, NOT APPROPRIATE FOR A VERY BULLISH INVESTOR. Why? Because you *don't* want the price to skyrocket, because if that happened you would've made more money just holding the stock. Holding a stock means you're bullish on it - selling a covered call on that stock in comparison is more *bearish* on the stock. It's a bearish hedge against an overall bullish strategy, which is why your outlook on the stock should be roughly neutral to bullish ONLY UNDER THE STRIKE PRICE. The last thing you would want is to get assigned at the bottom of a major bull run - assignment is only good if it's your exit strategy from your position.

If you're bullish on a stock you own, you could buy shares, buy a call, and/or sell a put as that's an inherently bullish strategy (and yes, you don't need to own the stock to do that). If you're bearish on a stock you own, you could sell a covered call if you think either it'll go through a temporary dip or will stay roughly where it's at / under the strike price, or if you think the price would tank it would be better to just sell your shares + buy a put.

Please, go ahead and sell an ITM covered call if you think assignment is the best thing that could happen to you. ""Oh hey look, I sold a covered call on GME at $100 strike and achieved maximum profit! Sure, I could've just held the shares and had a total value of $19,449, but $10,000 is MAX PROFIT I WANT MAX PROFIT WHY DO YOU HATE MONEY?!?"" This is basically what you're saying."

03/23/2021,stocks,"First off don’t listen to me I’m just some idiot on the internet who knows nothing about investing. However I would recommend holding it. There will always be more flashy growth stocks no matter what stock you buy into and the stocks that are growing are constantly changing. Growth is supposed to happen over years. Msft is one of the top players in tech. The market that they are in is just going to grow over time. Even if you think they don’t have as much upside as some of these other companies they are an extremely solid company that I see only going up in the years to come. Now how quickly it goes up may not be to your liking however you also need to take into account the risk involved. If you look at  other growth stocks they have a lot more risk associated to them and imo you are better off having some safe companies, preferably with dividends that are able to be consistently decent and then if you want you can go after those growth stocks.
TLDR - imo keep msft, solid company, will continue to grow, have some safe stocks like msft, jnj, etc before worrying about growth stocks"
03/23/2021,stocks,Yeah that's why I was considering selling it honestly. I only have about 1 share of it and I have other safe long-term stocks so I was thinking of adding to my other positions that is a growth stock. I was thinking more along the lines of Square of Sea Limited (which I already own) because I plan on holding those for a long time as well. But I invested in it for a reason so I'm going to hold and just increase positions in all three over time.
03/23/2021,stocks,I mean if you believe in that company more than MSFT and you have safe stocks already and want to take more of a high risk high reward go for it. You gotta do what you think is right and best for yourself

However, I'm trying to do a bit of my own DD as well and have a question for you. How does the lifetime of nuclear reactors factor into the bull thesis? I've read that most reactors have an expected lifespan of around 40 years and with many having been built in the 80s-90s, this means they are coming up to the end of their life cycles and may go offline. On the flip side, I've also read that the 40 years is a conservative estimate and many of those may stay online well beyond the expected 40 year lifespan. Just wondering what your thoughts are on this."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Hey! Thanks for the compliment, I appriciate that.

I don't see selling at $15 to be a bad thing, because you never know... it could have gone up. As long as you don't lose any of the money you put in, it's not so bad. Good job!

03/23/2021,stocks,"If you look at the stock in the last year, it jumps up in quick bursts then has small corrections or stalls for a couple months as people take profit. 

My best guess was a level of profit taking and the February housing numbers which came out last week. The headlines keep saying that housing starts are down while lumber is surging to imply a connection between the two, but they are ignoring that housing starts are always down in January/February. This last Feb being particularly bad due to that massive storm that shut down a third of the country for a week. Or its the NAHB pushing out click bait headlines trying to get action on the lumber tarriffs. 

It’s unwarranted. Housing construction is still booming (eg see Lennar Earnings that just came out; beat estimates and projecting substantially more home construction the next Q). The march housing starts/permit numbers that come out mid April will likely reflect that and the stock should get back on track leading up to earnings."

03/23/2021,stocks,Tried bulls of wall street discord. Had decent picks but was a bunch of chads more than traders and were super toxic if you didn't fall in line or someone disagreed. Saw it too many times with random ppl that it wasn't just a one off. Would not recommend
03/23/2021,stocks,Why isn't he in prison
03/23/2021,stocks,"They are, but not in the sense you are thinking about them. Look at the SLR formula. Treasuries go on the bottom of that formula."
03/23/2021,stocks,"RSI is a buy, but we may come down and test $9. I’m waiting a bit right now!"
03/23/2021,stocks,But anything below $11 is a buy to me.
03/23/2021,stocks,I’m glad you said this because I bought again at 10.05 20mins ago!!
03/23/2021,stocks,:) we should bounce in the next couple days but I'm going to wait until tomorrow to add another $1000!
03/23/2021,stocks,"So im another rookie who just started trading stonks earlier this month and i'm having the exact same issue.  this REALLY cleared things up for me as i bought some GME at $189 yesterday (i use TD as well) and this morning my cost/share is $214.  But i did fold my paper hands earlier this month and lost exactly that % when i sold so this checks out.

&#x200B;

also if you buy penny stocks they don't factor in the $6.99 OTC trade fee until the morning and that averages into your cost/share price too.

&#x200B;

we live and we learn people"
03/23/2021,stocks,"I thinkkkk it's just the price you had paid for it, bc you bought something and did not receive it. 

But it would very difficult to be in that situation."
03/23/2021,stocks,"Yeah. It would be pretty crazy.

Thanks for all the info."
03/23/2021,stocks,"The bull case for WeWork is to be the AWS of physical space.  
Examples:

* \>30% of their renters are enterprise customers (think salespeople for MSFT etc..)
* They have one of the fastest concepts for running office build-outs in the industry
* COVID accelerated the trend of flexible work space

The bear case is that they're a poorly run IWG lol.

If they can prove that they've gotten their unit economics under control, it could be an attractive opportunity."
03/23/2021,stocks,"$LLKKF
Buckle up and thank me in 8 weeks 🚀"
03/23/2021,stocks,"I'm using it as a bond replacement in my portfolio.  I already owned VTI, VEU, VBR, VWO, and VCIT.  VCIT has done crap over the past 5 years, and bonds are probably going to do crap over the foreseeable future.  So I converted my VCIT into QYLD and will take the dividends."
03/23/2021,stocks,Looks like the results are not favorable.  That’s a big let down for those of us who are who suffer from what they were attempting to treat.
03/23/2021,stocks,These results are tragic and not just from a financial perspective. FX-322 was going to do so much good for so many people... including me. I can’t believe it has absolutely no affect. Heart breaking.
03/23/2021,stocks,"Man, this was an unkind premarket. The report must've been shit?"
03/23/2021,stocks,Hard luck to you. $36 to $9 after results.
03/23/2021,stocks,"This one hurt. I’ll buy some shares now that it’s under $9, but seems like my October call will probably remain worthless from here on out."
03/23/2021,stocks,stock just went on sale lol i bought some
03/23/2021,stocks,"So that went tits up. 

Do you expect them to now go bankrupt, taken over by another company, or somewhat recover by tinkering with the formula or betting on some of the other treatments they already had in the pipeline. 

&#x200B;

TL;DR

What would you do now, would you double down and invest some more at a discount, or cut your losses?"
03/23/2021,stocks,"Fast forward to now, the Phase 2 didn't work with multi-injections and their stock plunged 75%... I'm just now discovering this company. Any recommendations about investing in it now? Do these companies recover from something like this, or should it be left alone?"
03/23/2021,stocks,"Ouch man, ouch"
03/23/2021,stocks,Yeah uhhhhhhh about those results...
03/23/2021,stocks,"You ok, bud?"
03/23/2021,stocks,Tell me more about this “sleeping giant”.
03/23/2021,stocks,Aged like milk
03/23/2021,stocks,"Yeah just saw that too, wondering if it is extreme and if it will bounce back some throughout the day or if this stock is going to remain in the single digits."
03/23/2021,stocks,Mixed results. Four doses didn't do anything stat sig over placebo (unclear as to whether single dose did show stat sig). They also announced results of another parallel ph1 study. That produced good results with stat sig. So it's a strange readout. Need to see what they say in conference call soon. Very sorry for all involved if this turns out to be bad.
03/23/2021,stocks,I'm wondering the same exact thing. New to investing and have no experience with the medical industries.
03/23/2021,stocks,Look into their cash supply. If they go bankrupt it will be years down the line.
03/23/2021,stocks,Roll the dice. It could or could not.
03/23/2021,stocks,"In all seriousness though, this is the perennial gamble with biotech. Even a company with great prospects can be a sunk ship with a bad trial for their flagship (only?) drug. Who knows what actually happened - this may be an overreaction from the market, or they may be dead in the water. $FREQ of course says it was probably due to how the trial was conducted, that they're still hopeful and moving forward on the single-dose, etc., but they're probably as panicked about the results as everyone else.   
OP's DD looked pretty good. Not much you can do about unexpected results that tank the premarket 80%."
03/23/2021,stocks,Still sleeping. Maybe breathing?
03/23/2021,stocks,Listening to the call and it seems like there is still a strong path forward with the single dose approach which continues to show benefit over placebo.
03/23/2021,stocks,I just purchased 500 shares at $10
03/23/2021,stocks,"I think of it as tuition fee when learning about trading. I was dumb to invest so it's my fault.

Do you think they can recover from this though? Are they producing other interesting drugs? Do they have other drugs on the market? What can realistically happen to this stock now?"
03/23/2021,stocks,I agree. Biotechs are definitely a gamble. This was very surprising though.
03/23/2021,stocks,Yeah I read everything I could find and listened to that. Feel this drop is over hyped and the company still has a good chance of success.
03/23/2021,stocks,I'll be buying a chunk at market open once I see the CC values. If it's anything like they are now it will be worth it.
03/23/2021,stocks,Need to see what they say in webcast. It's clear 1 dose works. Unclear whether they can proceed to Phase 3 with 1 dose. Market is reacting badly but volume is low so this isn't exactly clear cut yet
03/23/2021,stocks,Looks like it’s holding steady around $10.  Hopefully that’s a good base.  Here’s to long term success 🍻
03/23/2021,stocks,Did you get a chance to check out the webcast? I'd be interested to hear your opinions.
03/23/2021,stocks,Cheers to that!
03/23/2021,stocks,Just doubled my investment and bought another 500 at 9.97.  They have something that works.  That will likely be worth something eventually. And I’m going to try and get into the trial.
03/23/2021,stocks,"I am in the same mind set. It might till the next trial release but if the single dose works we will likely be back up in the 30s again. Just need to wait for the next set of results, however long that takes."
03/23/2021,stocks,Yeah.  I have 1000 shares and plan to sit on those for a long time.
03/23/2021,stocks,I am sitting on 400 and will just wait it out
03/23/2021,stocks,Ooohh thank you that makes sense
03/23/2021,stocks,any idea why ADVM dropped 5% after hours today? Seems like a big drop for no reason. What’s a good stop loss for this one?
03/23/2021,stocks,Looks like your run of the mill consolidation. I wouldnt freak out. Near $10 for me
03/23/2021,stocks,"For a side project, its meh and probably overkill.

However, if you require data and PCI compliance enterprise logging, good luck shipping that on top your flagship product.

This is a build versus buy decision for most companies. Most companies should lean towards buy unless they want the hassle for building, maintaining this infrastructure.

On average, it is cheaper to just pay them than to hire a team to build this if you compare the time and YOY salary of software engineers."
