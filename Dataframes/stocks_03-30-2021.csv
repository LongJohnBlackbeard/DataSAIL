03/30/2021,stocks,Gonzaga might be safer than the market lmao
03/30/2021,stocks,"Sir, this is a casino.  Unless you really want to play roulette..."
03/30/2021,stocks,My 2 cents: pull your money out of the market. The risk just isn’t worth it with such a short timeframe.
03/30/2021,stocks,I bought up a bunch of VIAC.
03/30/2021,stocks,Spce.
03/30/2021,stocks,BA has been good and so has VWAGY recently.
03/30/2021,stocks,Buy Tesla
03/30/2021,stocks,gme is a day/swing traders paradise
03/30/2021,stocks,Thanks for the voice of reasoning. My true gambling side is clouding my judgement these days
03/30/2021,stocks,This is the right answer. One month is way too short and risky for money you will need.
03/30/2021,stocks,"Thanks this is also on my watch, but a bit volatile right now for my liking. Definite upside potential for the aggressive investors"
03/30/2021,stocks,This is probably #1 on my list despite the volatility and my desire for a more conservative approach. Just waiting for Nasdaq to show some signs of green
03/30/2021,stocks,"I bought VIAC yesterday at 41$. Was planning a swing trade, could have sold today for +8%, but I like the stock. Gonna hang on to it."

03/30/2021,stocks,"A lot of the expectations are already priced in, thats one of the reasons NVIDIA, TSM, and AMD have been trading sideways for a month since the early March sell off. If theres another big sell to come i would buy in then, but right now you're pretty much buying the top of the curve."
03/30/2021,stocks,"What is ""normal?"" There will continue to be an increased demand for chips and conductors as more and more of our everyday objects require them. So what is normal? What is causing the shortage? If it's simply a supply and demand issue, demand will never decrease."
03/30/2021,stocks,Who knows. I’ve heard that the demand will be up though the third quarter this year. I anticipate growth until then and then leveling and/or subsiding. But I get it wrong a lot!
03/30/2021,stocks,"Most brokers have FIFO (first in first out) by default.

In first scenario, 80 shares came from your 100 early shares, so it will be long term gain.

In second scenario, 100 shares will be long term, while 30 shares will be short term."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Every single one share is treated as an individual asset with an individual identifier your broker stores. The default tax system for asset sales in the US is First, in First out. Meaning your sale of 80 would come only out of the January pot, and be entirely long term gains. 


Some brokers let you control what shares you sell specifically, in case you wanted to sell your most recent shares first. I know TD ameritrade is one such broker as I changed mine to default to Last In, First Out to avoid taxes on profits."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Perfect, thank you for that answer. This is how I was imagining it playing out. Thank you for confirming it! 🙇‍♂️"
03/30/2021,stocks,"Great info, I did not know you have the flexibility to choose depending on your broker. Much thanks, friend!"
03/30/2021,stocks,"Fidelity also allows you to specify which specific shares you're selling, but the default is first in, first out."
03/30/2021,stocks,Goldman is just trying to argue that lying in their information material to investors is fine.
03/30/2021,stocks,"We are in business to make money for Goldman Sachs, not our, ahem, proles customers."
03/30/2021,stocks,GS is arguing it is OK to mislead investors for us to profit off of them.
03/30/2021,stocks,What douche bags
03/30/2021,stocks,Is all a tradition passed down from the good old dutch trading company with spices tobacco and whatnot
03/30/2021,stocks,It’s the fact that they all colluded in shorting GameStop and amc. Now they are going to crawl over each other to switch sides
03/30/2021,stocks,I'm kinda confused at the point of this post. I mean did anyone really belive goldman had their interests at heart. Yea we know all street is sleezy and investment banks are greedy and do illegal thing but I just don't see the point of constantly coming back to this.
03/30/2021,stocks,"""We can't lie? How are we supposed to make our living? Do you expect me to live in a 4 bedroom house with ONLY 3 bathrooms? How can anyone survive without jacuzzi, pool, sauna and a golf yard? What about our mountain cabins? Do you expect us to rent a hotel room? What are we, animals?"""
03/30/2021,stocks,Woah rofl just like wtf 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
03/30/2021,stocks,"It's one thing to think that Goldman Sachs is scum. 

It is another thing entirely to hear them confirm it. 

Plus it's like a public service announcement. Always a great thing to remind people of. Remember marketing is effective. Or else they wouldn't do it."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Ahh, the Sidney Powell defence. I don’t think it will fly."
03/30/2021,stocks,I'm not talking about the courts decision..I'm ask why we r/stocks need to discuss this when it has very little to do with stocks and more finnance as a whole unless they were talking about the goldman sachs stock but I didn't see any idacatior that op was.
03/30/2021,stocks,Because they can jack your stock with a bs article
03/30/2021,stocks,Yea well most of the time the ibanks are actually long and not short for one so it's in their intrest to pump a stock with good targets. Ibanks and hedge funds are diffrent should you trust an ibanks target no but they won't downgrade it without reason
03/30/2021,stocks,Oh yeah. $SPH is primed for a move for sure. The triangle is converged right at support. Might be a good play for a straddle
03/30/2021,stocks,Markets gonna crash
03/30/2021,stocks,That’s facts
03/30/2021,stocks,Okay then short it lol
03/30/2021,stocks,Oh word?
03/30/2021,stocks,Why
03/30/2021,stocks,"Agreed. Growth stocks are oversold right now - once bond rates stagnate and big money realizes there is no more money to be made from industrials and reopening plays, all that money will go right back into growth."
03/30/2021,stocks,Boo ya!  That was a great earnings play
03/30/2021,stocks,Yeah most of it might be due to the last moment gift card sale to pad up revenues.
03/30/2021,stocks,"Because they knew that news was coming, so they ""bought the rumor"" Now once that news has been released they take their profits ""sell the news"". Except for unpredictable emergencies or well hidden updates..most news is already at least partially priced into the stock before retail investors even hear the rumor...then retail investors price it in more...Some times news is overhyped and too many people buy in and then you have a massive sell off once the update hits. A lot of the people that bought in early for said news will sell when it's released. Bringing the price down...If you're long it shouldn't matter because it'll climb back up at where that news was going to bring it anyway. But if you are trying and failing to buy and sell short gain on current news...you're going to be dissappointed. The market will almost always be ahead of you if you are relying on current updates."
03/30/2021,stocks,You’re basically asking why someone would sell at a profit. The whole point of stocks is to make money.
03/30/2021,stocks,Buy on rumour sell on news
03/30/2021,stocks,"Some people subscribe to the ""buy low, sell high"" theory of investing.  I know, it's completely nuts but there is no convincing them that they are doing it all wrong.  What are you going to do.  They do seem to make it work some how.  Strange!"
03/30/2021,stocks,To take profits
03/30/2021,stocks,"Buy low, sell high."
03/30/2021,stocks,Expectations (whisper numbers) may have been even higher.  Or one metric dropped like gross margin.
03/30/2021,stocks,"earning calls are long

let's say i have 1000% YoY growth -> you would obviously buy on that because that's great news

30 minutes later, i announce this is completely unsustainable and next year, i'll have -50% YoY growth -> you would then sell when you hear that because that's trash"
03/30/2021,stocks,"Buy on rumor, sell on fact"
03/30/2021,stocks,Because there are professionals that wake up before you and they don't get their news from Bloomberg.
03/30/2021,stocks,"To reduce the price, to buy more at discount?"
03/30/2021,stocks,This makes the most sense. Sell at the high point. Thank you.
03/30/2021,stocks,"I use RBC direct investing, the fees are a little high but it’s reliable"
03/30/2021,stocks,Questrade isn’t great but it’s the best we got. Ibrk is good if you are daytrading.
03/30/2021,stocks,"Wealthsimple is commission/fee free, but doesn’t have every available stock"
03/30/2021,stocks,Interactive brokers are #1
03/30/2021,stocks,Qtrade is alright. Better than WS imo.  I know nothing of questrade.
03/30/2021,stocks,What are the fees like?
03/30/2021,stocks,I heard they’re giving a free stock to everyone that signs up. Would you know if that’s true?
03/30/2021,stocks,"I’ve saw that wealthsimple only does tax free saving accounts, not instant deductible accounts... is that true?"
03/30/2021,stocks,What kind of investing? And what are the fees?
03/30/2021,stocks,9.95$ per trade if I’m not mistaken
03/30/2021,stocks,"I don’t think that’s a thing that I know of, free etf purchases, low fees, fairly easy to move money in and out, crappy app and customer service though"
03/30/2021,stocks,No mines not set up with my TFSA
03/30/2021,stocks,They do cash or tfsa or rrsp
03/30/2021,stocks,TD is the same
03/30/2021,stocks,"Oh ok, thanks!"
03/30/2021,stocks,What do you mean by cash? Like is it a physical payment?
03/30/2021,stocks,Not margin but cash so you invest with whatever you put in freely without the confines of a tfsa or rrsp
03/30/2021,stocks,i have read customer’s reviews of blink charging stations and that was enough for me to stay away frm this scam company
03/30/2021,stocks,The $6.37/annually figure is mind blowing. They should've went out of business yesterday lol.
03/30/2021,stocks,Great research!
03/30/2021,stocks,"Just took a look at their recent 8-k filing and quick glances at their past 10-q, accumulating debt and operating at a net loss year after year and using the debt to expand while also paying down the debt with stock sales is what it looks like. Maybe they're hoping to get bought up or merge before they're completely insolvent?"
03/30/2021,stocks,I’ve shorted 50 shares since 48$. Great post btw.
03/30/2021,stocks,This is the reason I come here. Excellent post
03/30/2021,stocks,"For me, it was a toss up between Blink and Chargepoint. Glad I chose the latter."
03/30/2021,stocks,Well if this is true thank fuck I didn’t invest in them. I waiting for the price to drop to the 20s for me to be interested. I guess I won’t worry about that now.
03/30/2021,stocks,"Posts like this is why I view DD posts of companies with a healthy dose of skepticism. Unless I know something about the company, I don't believe the rosy posts I see. I just scroll past them as a pump and dump."
03/30/2021,stocks,"I was gonna go long on BLNK at the 2.xx range until I came across one of their stations in Sonoma County, CA. The thing was is total disrepair and I shelved the idea. Kicked myself in the ass for that one a few times but the info above does seem par for the course with Blink."
03/30/2021,stocks,"> Data for this post was sourced from the Culper Research Report on Blink Charging Co, published in August of 2020. I have no reason to believe that significant changes have occurred since.

Stock price of BLNK in August 2020 was around 11. Its 37 now.

If you followed the advice of this, you would have lost a lot of money. Note that the company could very well be crap as the research note suggests (I haven’t looked). Shorting is hard."
03/30/2021,stocks,Great dd !!  Thank you nuff said .
03/30/2021,stocks,"BLNK was a electric car charging company since 2008, yeah there were no EVs on the road back then so it probably started off as a trash cash siphon, but now that EVs are on the road, the company seems to accidendtly become legit."
03/30/2021,stocks,"yup. I saw this ticker being recommended here a few months ago. Did my DD and something felt off. 

Yet. somehow the lawyers chose to sue FUBO instead of this company"
03/30/2021,stocks,most of this info (except culper’s site visits) is public knowledge but i know what you mean. i definitely do not feel bad about avoiding this stock.
03/30/2021,stocks,that doesn’t change the fact that this company is a ticking time bomb imo. i just think it’s important for people to know.
03/30/2021,stocks,"Surprised that they have the cash to do this, but they should have a killer quarter, given how much oil prices have risen since their last ER."
03/30/2021,stocks,"I’ll do my best to explain:

1.  For non-retirement accounts, ETFs are more tax efficient because the mutual fund gets taxed on turnover. The ETF does not get taxed on turnover (although both must pay capital gains from dividends and other distributions).

2.  For non-retirement accounts, an index mutual fund will usually be more tax efficient than an actively managed mutual fund, as the index will likely experience less turnover, but pretty much all funds, including indexes, will experience turnover."
03/30/2021,stocks,https://youtu.be/E3D35ioEmCI
03/30/2021,stocks,[deleted]
03/30/2021,stocks,"I believe its because mutual funds tend to have a lot of turnover. They buy and sell a lot of securities within the fund which generates taxable capital gains.

ETFs don’t do this unless the index itself changes."
03/30/2021,stocks,"you wrote non-retirement accounts for both 1 and 2, did you mean to do that? Just need clarification, thanks"
03/30/2021,stocks,don't ETFs and stocks most of the time also have dividend payouts and have the same issue?
03/30/2021,stocks,"I think a lot of ppl actually expected space plays, at least I did... Well at least RocketLab to be honest... (no i dont own any VACQ)"
03/30/2021,stocks,Surprised Rocket Mortgage didn’t make it into ARKX.
03/30/2021,stocks,Maybe they’ll use the other space SPACS as positive catalysts to drive the ETF higher?  Who knows.
03/30/2021,stocks,"I heard you like etfs, Cathie likes her etfs so much she has some etfs buy her other etfs."
03/30/2021,stocks,no love for Raytheon??
03/30/2021,stocks,"Hey,  you get exposure to a different mix of tech,  with a space lean.  Why not? I like the ETF, lol."
03/30/2021,stocks,"I’m 2500 in .. I like the etf also next year I’ll be thanking myself for things long term play boys

Edit: maybe she will re invent ETF’s so they aren’t just focused souly on one part of the market and it will blow up 😄🔥"
03/30/2021,stocks,"It's basically a tech ETF. If you want exposure to remote sensing/satelites go for TRMB, it's the main holding of the ARKX fund, and the most immediately ""space"" related holding in the fund. Finances are solid, and it's an established company, so i just picked up their shares rather than the actual ARKX fund"
03/30/2021,stocks,"Here's my issue with the etf it's not balanced. It's very jumbled with names like Netflix and John deere along side virgin galactic and lockheed martin, autodesk and workhorse. There just isn't any consistency like her other etfs and this is coming from someone who isn't the biggest cathie fan but her other etfs have consistency. I can see this etf getting very mixed returns because you are not betting on a sector you are betting on multiple diffrent sectors that move differently."
03/30/2021,stocks,I hope if I ever say I nibbled on a stock someone kills me
03/30/2021,stocks,"It seems kind of like arkk but different plays rather then a legit space etf.

And I'm already losing my ass in arkk."
03/30/2021,stocks,"I think she's waiting after the merger, or at least when the SPAC sector stops getting shit on."
03/30/2021,stocks,Yeah I like it too. Can’t wait for the thread in a year from now clowning on it for having Deere yet it’s up 50%.
03/30/2021,stocks,"Yo dawg, I heard you like innovation. So we put some innovation in your innovation so you can innovate while you innovate."
03/30/2021,stocks,You get exposure to other Cathie Wood ETFs too! 2008 synthetic CDO vibes
03/30/2021,stocks,Any exposure to Tesla or SQ?
03/30/2021,stocks,The innate problem is there isn't a lot of good companies to invest in right now everybody's acting like this thing isn't going to be rebalanced
03/30/2021,stocks,"wouldnt a better play be to buy VACQ before its converted to RKLB? im assuming that when people see the RKLB ticker, theyll start purchasing so the price/share will go up"
03/30/2021,stocks,Comparing a 3D printing etf being included in a “space” etf to what happened in 2008 is extremely ridiculous.
03/30/2021,stocks,Are you asking about the etf or me. Anyways in both cases no
03/30/2021,stocks,It's like they never heard of actively managed ETF
03/30/2021,stocks,"Sorry, that was ambiguous. I meant in Arkx, the ETF?"
03/30/2021,stocks,It's like they never heard actively managed ETFs overwhelmingly underperform the S&P500
03/30/2021,stocks,No exposure to those two
03/30/2021,stocks,except when it does
03/30/2021,stocks,Thanks
03/30/2021,stocks,"betting on a 20% chance to outperform index, I'll take better odds elsewhere."
03/30/2021,stocks,"LOL

Today, ""OMG PLUG WTFBBQ!!1one""

In 3 months from now, ""wow good thing they have so much PLUG...to the moon!""

Thanks for the update OG OP"
03/30/2021,stocks,"The fastest way to rebalance your portfolio is to just have a heavily weighted position lose value!

I should write articles!"
03/30/2021,stocks,"Okay now get to $30 by eom, please and thank you. My calls are on their last breath"
03/30/2021,stocks,Enph is the best company in there why not just buy them ?
03/30/2021,stocks,Looks like they’ve added more PLUG. 🤦🏻‍♂️ ffs
03/30/2021,stocks,I hope this etf can go back to $30.
03/30/2021,stocks,"Thanks for reposting this with the table sorted by weight.  I'm happy they reduced their weight in PLUG (the previous table you posted must have been incorrect because it showed they doubled it, lol).

I'm really hopeful the new balancing helps things with this ETF.  Nothing looks too crazy, but the reduction in PLUG alone makes me happy, haha.

If anyone has trouble scrolling the table, check out the post on [new.reddit.com](https://new.reddit.com)"
03/30/2021,stocks,"The increase in PLUG is super interesting especially for a company that is quite literally all over the place. 

Ima revisit ICLN when it becomes a long in my portfolio."
03/30/2021,stocks,Still need to cut down on PlUG and they are not..
03/30/2021,stocks,Quality Motley Fool content.
03/30/2021,stocks,They have no moat.
03/30/2021,stocks,"It might look like a bad move now, but ICLN isn't really a short term stock. I feel like they're hedging for the future, in the hopes that PLUG commits to their promises coming closer to 2022 (I think thats when they said they'd be profitable). I agree that PLUG does cause a lot of volatility, but with €17 million in cash on hand, I feel like they're looking to buy the next dip that shows up."
03/30/2021,stocks,I could see it going back to $30 considering they've increased their positions in most of the stocks. It just depends on whether they bought at the top or the bottom.
03/30/2021,stocks,They reduced their weight in PLUG by way of losing money on it. Looks to me that the number of shares now is higher than the number of shares before.
03/30/2021,stocks,"Ya, I realised that after posting, It stumped me for a good few minutes, but I decided to just delete the post and change it before posting again because there were a couple more issues I wanted to fix."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Ugh, you're right haha.  i should have looked at the share count"
03/30/2021,stocks,"There’s no fucking way they are using banks as fulfillment centers. It logistically makes zero sense. 

Whose running their ecosystem expansion?

They already are splitting from Mail.ru, idk why they think more tech will help them when they can’t handle what they already had. Sounds like they are trying to be something they don’t know how to be."
03/30/2021,stocks,Lol only in russia...
03/30/2021,stocks,"Holding 612 at $17 CDN.
Too tied up to average down.

Well I guess I’m about to get another chance.

Fuck."
03/30/2021,stocks,"We don't take losses, we just become long term investors 😎"
03/30/2021,stocks,"Holy shit. 

I made more off of Blackberry last year than Blackberry did."
03/30/2021,stocks,My BlackBerry hurts @17.51 👀🥂
03/30/2021,stocks,"This sub pretty much confirms that 99% of traders go on pure emotions.

Everyone here absolutely knew that earnings would be nothing special. BB's real revenue is what comes into fruition from their pipelines in 2-3 years. Hell, IVY is coming out in less than a year...

You guys all knew this, but still freak out because they met expectations? 

Go outside, smell the air, and come back later."
03/30/2021,stocks,How do we look at these numbers and determine they are bad? I'm pretty new to all this.
03/30/2021,stocks,I don't know what people were expecting. The bear argument (at least for the next few years) was always that BB simply does not generate significant revenue. They sell low-price annual subscriptions that businesses are happy to have but there is no premium product or scalable per-usage model that they can then push onto those businesses. Monetization of EV data is supposed to be their big play to fill that gap but it will not come for years. Institutional investors have to consider the opportunity cost of parking money in BB and having to wait 3 or 4 years on marginal or no returns before BB would theoretically explode.
03/30/2021,stocks,"F in the chat boys.

From a man that is holding 4000 shares at avg. of $12.5 I can say we either in for a long-long-long term or even a longer term. Doubt we see 20s by EOY. Hopefully guidance is better, but damn these numbers are so underwhelming and miss. Now it's understandable why they went all-out on marketing before the Q report, trying to mitigate fire.

Well, holding for at least 3-5 years, but as far as it goes for 2021 - we got hit by a 360 roundhouse kick right to the temple.

EDIT: I went from Palantir to Palantears within the last week, now I go from BlackBerry to NoBerry."
03/30/2021,stocks,Holding 1100 shares @ 11.17. I am disappointed but not really all that surprised by these results sadly.
03/30/2021,stocks,Had a great day today aaaaaaannnndd it’s gone.
03/30/2021,stocks,Well... that's pretty bad.
03/30/2021,stocks,God fucking dammit man. Can anything I put money in go right this year????
03/30/2021,stocks,"holding for a while, a lot of emotional investors out there"
03/30/2021,stocks,pain.
03/30/2021,stocks,Just keep selling covered calls. I keep buying shares and selling calls. You win both ways
03/30/2021,stocks,"Positives: Operating cash inflows and no real current liabilities.
The goodwill write down kills the bottom line but it's a noncash transaction. Curious about their analysis of booking that impairment loss."
03/30/2021,stocks,"If it makes anyone feel better, i'm BALLS DEEP in Palantir, BlackBerry, and PSTH. Down about 30% now."
03/30/2021,stocks,make a meme about it you'll feel better
03/30/2021,stocks,It was always a super long term hold. I personally sold after the hype was gone. Ended up breaking even as my loss canceled out my gain.
03/30/2021,stocks,margin of 70% pretty amazing
03/30/2021,stocks,"It is getting flat rocked AH... but in my Neanderthal opinion, I think people are going to buy in, particularly if it opens down at $8.50. and it will shoot back up to roughly where it closed at. This is one of those classic get in at the bottom type moments. (most of that is just me trying to manifest optimism...)

Nobody expected good earnings... analyst expectations have remained low and any hype on this stock has always be a long term prospect. I don't see that as changed. 

Either way, options seem oddly robust still. I'll keep scraping in like $35 per 8 day call and wait and see... I am not in that deep, I am cost average $10.38, so calls really are keeping me overall close to break even with the depressed price."

They still have great penetration on the “new” vehicle market that is going to be dominant.

03/30/2021,stocks,"yeah I have been selling PLTR puts to start wheeling, but the IV premiums are pitiful... I'm trying to find better stocks to sell puts on"
03/30/2021,stocks,Yeah. He did crush it for a while though.
03/30/2021,stocks,what do you call a -30% price decrease?
03/30/2021,stocks,Savage.
03/30/2021,stocks,Ouch
03/30/2021,stocks,Comment of the day!
03/30/2021,stocks,Beast lol. If only there was a bit that did this everytime a question was asked.
03/30/2021,stocks,Pure gold.....
03/30/2021,stocks,"lol that guy doesn't understand the difference between share price and market cap, don't bother"
03/30/2021,stocks,"Dude I don't give a shit about their p/e. I'm just trying to make mone.Market has been divorced from reality for years now.  I will do it my way, you do it yours."
03/30/2021,stocks,You should use earnings valuation metrics once the company has stabilised so pointless to assess Tesla
03/30/2021,stocks,"No question, that’s why he’s one of the GOATs. I just don’t know why people are expecting him to keep up even remotely the same level of performance at 90. If someone is 90 and still breathing they’re already well ahead of the pack lol, can’t really expect much more out of a 90 year old than that."
03/30/2021,stocks,"The Nasdaq, relatively tech heavy, is down all the way to...what it was in January. Arkk is down to what it was in December. 

I think most ppl are seeing this as a small correction or a rotation to prefer other stocks with fears of interest rates. The market has a whole is fine as well.  Even at current evaluations most tech companies are overvalued. 

I dont think a 30% correction was common in (established) tech at all. Most of the companies that corrected that much were already insanely over valued before."
03/30/2021,stocks,Ark innovation fund is still up 160% for the past year after a 30% drop. That’s not a crash it’s a minor blip down. Zoom out to the 10 yr chart on the spy and there’s almost zero doubt it has a 10% correction from here and hits 350 sometime this year which will drag tech down even more
03/30/2021,stocks,I know.  He kind of lost me when he said Amazon is more expensive
03/30/2021,stocks,"this type of talk reassures me that we are indeed in a bubble, Not that that was up for debate very much in the first place. And no I'm not sitting out of the market but I ain't touching tesla with a stick."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Since you don't care about valuations,  I'll sell you my cell phone for 3000$."
03/30/2021,stocks,"I don't need to use earnings to see a company worth 600b that has Sales to support 50-100b in cap.  One proven concept in revenue,  and about 5x in hype future business ideas that are also overpriced.  Home batteries at most is a 50b business. Cars at most 200b business. Creating newer ways of doing things takes market share from competitors,  but it doesn't add billions of dollars to an existing market size."
03/30/2021,stocks,tesla is so overpriced it's comical. The car sales are going to be outpaced by Voltswagen and the other big boy manufacturers in the near future.
03/30/2021,stocks,"people are buying stocks just cause they believe they will go up, its def a bubble and tesla is leading it. Imagine thinking tesla will go back to 1000x after it crashes....they are missing the whole point of the bubble lmao"
03/30/2021,stocks,He frequents WSB so you see why he is like this
03/30/2021,stocks,You seem like the kind of guy that wipes back to front.
03/30/2021,stocks,You really comparing a depreciating asset to buy a high PE stock in a bull market? There’s still lots of potential for profit even in high PE stocks
03/30/2021,stocks,"Car company, tech company, advanced battery company, charging infrastructure company, solar panel company, etc. 

It ain't some typical boomer era car company. Can't use boomer era valuation methods. Still wouldn't buy it though. I suspect it'll bounce around between $500 per share-$700 a share for quite awhile."
03/30/2021,stocks,"its also amazing how the tesla illusion has been maintained for so long, the tesla bubble should be already obvious to anyone with 2 braincells."
03/30/2021,stocks,"The point is,  knowing the price your paying. It seems like around here people don't know the price they pay for a stock,  but since they know the value of the phone it's easy to decline the offer. The initial post was about a crash, not a bull market.  I promise you,  tsla will NEVER be more than a 2 trillion company,  they will likely be lucky to get a trillion.  The folks who don't understand economics tend to put a huge valuation on their future businesses as if they're successful with it today."
03/30/2021,stocks,"musk is def a marketing genius, he has kids believing he has reinvented the wheel."
03/30/2021,stocks,"You can use those valuation methods because your still comparing revenue and IP to USD. They could be selling a tunnel that you can warp into China in an hour for all I care,  but if they sell 100 million dollars worth of trips in a year,  does it make them worth a trillion dollars because it's new, exciting, and different? Every business has a market and investing is about return on your dollars."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Yep. People may continue to be delusional until BMW, GM, VW, etc are all releasing multiple fleets of EVs each year."
03/30/2021,stocks,RemindMe! in 10 years
03/30/2021,stocks,RemindMe! 4 years
03/30/2021,stocks,"Congrats, you know more about economics than cathie woods. You have a bright future ahead of you."
03/30/2021,stocks,Jesus Christ there is literally no way you can possibly know this. I’m so bored of boomers spouting shit. Going to bed.

03/30/2021,stocks,"Go watch any VW ID.4 review on YouTube, saying ID.4 is a dog shit will be a praise."
03/30/2021,stocks,Lol love to see someone calling this out for what it is - every year its the same story but a different Tesla alternative legacy carmaker.
03/30/2021,stocks,"So your being pessimistic, but your saying the price will go up?"
03/30/2021,stocks,"For German sense of humor, the name change would crack them up."
03/30/2021,stocks,Somehow everyone already forgot about diselgate.
03/30/2021,stocks,Love Tesla!!!  Go DOGE!!!
03/30/2021,stocks,Wouldn't a Elon hater just buy oil and railroads?
03/30/2021,stocks,"The haters fail to tell you that Volkswagen will never catch Tesla when it some to the software or battery capacity, they are just too far behind."

03/30/2021,stocks,What price segment(price) are the cars of these both competing?
03/30/2021,stocks,"Price will go up sure.  It's however ludicrous to see Tesla haters argue about how the success and overtake of VW is the only certainty in life :P

They started out their thesis as ""EV is just BS"" years ago.

Now their play has become ""EV is indeed the next big thing BUT Tesla will never have the productive capacity of X"", and at the same time ""Tesla remains BS because they can't decide if they're FSD, or Insurance, etc.""

Well, we'll just have to see what they say once Tesla is the only one to have the balls to go into the business of providing SMART cars as a comprehensive package including:

a) the car itself,

b) autonomous driving,

c) insurance that accommodates autonomy,

d) whatever other unique ecosystem feature they can think of, because they are in the business designing cohesively under a common vision, with focus on innovating, instead of copycatting."
03/30/2021,stocks,I mean even the most hardcore ones would have to diversify into EV eventually :)
03/30/2021,stocks,How hard can one company try.
03/30/2021,stocks,Their joke sent the stock price up 9%.  So does this mean Volkswagen believes EV is a joke?  Their investors seemed to believe it was a good idea .
03/30/2021,stocks,"> The announcement was meant as an April Fools' Day joke to raise awareness about the company's all-electric ID.4 SUV, a spokesperson said in a statement.


Says it right there in the article."
03/30/2021,stocks,"ArcelorMittal, obvious choice.  
In for 30 contracts, up 40-250% spread across different strikes and dates. A lot of room left, it’s only just getting started.  
Imagine the rebate rate in Asia being lowered or cut."
03/30/2021,stocks,"I'm from the US but live in Europe.  I'm all over European companies.  I feel like there's great businesses here that American investors have no clue about and completely miss out on, thus making it easier to acquire them at a lower multiple.

Of course I have US stocks too but I'm not entirely weighted there as I assume many Americans are.

My account is US-based so I trade ADRs to avoid high commission fees.  It's not the same as owning a company that trades in euros, but it's something and a wonderful diversification play IMO."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Robinhood just disabled support for this stock. I went to look at the option chain, it grayed out, then came back to the main page and the buy button disappeared.
But, it looks like I can buy it with my other two brokers."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Another vitard in the wild?!

In on MT, CLF and X."
03/30/2021,stocks,What European companies are you currently invested in or looking to get into?
03/30/2021,stocks,"I'm in Iberdrola, Energias de Portugal, Inditex, Swedish Match, and Nestle.  Also, UK: British American Tobacco and Imperial Brands.

Iberdrola (Spain) / Energias de Portugal: Great renewable energy plays.  Global players and also have steady income and customers from traditional energy sources.  The only thing that worries me is the amount that they're leveraged but if everything goes smoothly they could really do well in the long-term.  From what I understand this amount of leveraging is normal in renewable energy companies.

Inditex: They own Zara and several other big, global brand name clothes retailers.  Growth has been killer the last 20 years or so with no signs of slowing down.  Covid rocked them pretty hard last year, however.  The good news is that they did a really good job on online sales during the same period, and are currently working to consolidate their business by shutting down stores that don't have much traffic and relying on heavily-frequented stores plus online.  On-the-ground research here in Spain says that women absolutely can't get enough of this brand.

Swedish Match: They sell chewing tobacco and smoking accessories and are also the #1 nicotine pouch brand (Zyn) in the US, Scandinavia, and are also looking to move into more European markets.  Zyn has really been killing it the last few years and sales continue rising.  As long as people like the idea of nicotine pouches and Zyn holds on to it's market share, there's huge growth potential here.  Steady cash flow from their other products as well.

Nestle: Just a boomer buy-and-hold stock.  Great products, great management, great numbers.  Transitioning into new trends like plant-based foods as well.  Seems to be going well.  Not the most ethical company apparently but my measly investment isn't going to change anything.

British American Tobacco: the biggest tobacco company based on sales.  Global exposure plus exposure to the US (unlike Phillip Morris International, which is only ex-US).  Smoking rates are going up in emerging markets, although most of their business is not there at the moment.  They also just acquired a stake in a pot company (OrganiGram).  This one is going to be steady and reliable with the added bonus of a possible successful transition into the cannabis market.

Imperial Brands: fourth largest tobacco company.  Global player although smaller than British American and PM.  Free cash flow has been killing it and they seem to be doing a good job focusing on their cigarette business.  Innovation, however, is lacking and their nextgen products (smoking alternatives) haven't been doing all that well.  Still, great free cash flow, decent dividend, and probably not going anywhere any time soon.

Oh, and Phillip Morris International: I guess you could consider them international since they're technically Swiss.  Their heat-not-burn product IQOS is doing quite well, and smoking rates going up in emerging markets is good for their business long-term.  Not sure that there's huge upside potential here, especially since it's already trading pretty high, but it won't be going anywhere anytime soon and the dividend is nice.

Not looking to get in any more at the moment.  I'm new to investing so I encourage you to only take this as a reference and do your own research.

\*\*\*Sorry for not giving tickers as US tickers / ADRs are not necessarily the same as European tickers."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Automation and robotics tech here. All new machinery is automated and has a PLC in some form or another. Biggest Rockwell’s PLC subsidiary is Allen Bradley. They are THE PLC and automation system in USA. My company has entered in an agreement 2 years ago to use AB automation sub components due to the demand from our customers. 
Furthermore more and more customers want remote data acquisition for logistics and efficiency tracking. 

They’re well established in the market that’s only going to expand in demand as old machines get replaced with newer, more efficient bit more automated models and expanding automation."
03/30/2021,stocks,"ROK has been the US leader for many, many years in the automation space, but it is losing market share every year. Mainly globally where Siemens and ABB have strengthened their positions through acquisitions.

I don't see a strong bear case but I also don't see any innovation on the horizon. The installation base has seen its best days, in my opinion.

Adding to that, they will still see growth due to the automation market growing as a whole, but I do not think they will grow proportionally larger than other innovators in the space."
03/30/2021,stocks,"I could deep dive for you - kind of fun topic.

Initial uninspiring anecdotal notes:

US manufacturing is pretty important to this company. I’d imagine medium to long term trends of US manufacturing will impact this company disproportionately to its competitors.

Some manufacturing spaces will outright reject IoT due to security concerns. Others will embrace.  That being said, production control = $. I feel the next step will be machine learning and visual observation/laser measurement of processes to capture production deficiencies as they occur. But any step in the production control environment is good.

Many us manufacturers do not have the engineering to fab their own production equipment - outsourcing none, some, or all, so this company may be impacted more heavily by its contracts with integrators and equipment providers. The growth or reduction of this companies competitors may have an outsized impact.

I’d guess this is a high margin industry assuming they manufacture in China."
03/30/2021,stocks,Its a good reopening trade - most movies have been pushed back as well. I expect well see a very strong winter/christmas movie schedule and a decent summer. That being said long term its not a business I want to own. At the end of the day I much prefer the convenience and cost of watching at home and the theatres have no long term power when they don't control content.
03/30/2021,stocks,"AMC is very volatile right now, if it wasn’t for all this WSB nonsense it might make sense to buy but I’d avoid it right now. Other chains are possible to look into. Drive ins are doing really well right now"
03/30/2021,stocks,I went in a got a few theatre tickets. Should have held out for a half price sale however. It had been recieving equal ups and downs like side by side rollercoasters. Not so much now. Bonus bucks soured some on it as well. I still like going and the popcorn is addictive. Kids will still use it as a cheap first date and a place to hold hands for the first time. I got nothin else for ya. Lol
03/30/2021,stocks,I exited AMC and Cineplex last week. I might buy back in if they dip again but it feels like like a gamble rather than an investment.
03/30/2021,stocks,"Bad news with AMC: the stock is massively overpriced right now and a terrible long term investment.

Good news: as one of the premier meme stocks it has a huge following which gives it incredible volatility. A small catalyst can end up pushing the price up 20% in a single day, and it will crash down just as hard. You can definitely profit off of that behavior if you have the stomach for it."
03/30/2021,stocks,Have fun if AMC decides to dilute their shares further to get out of debt.
03/30/2021,stocks,"I don’t think so. Crazy debt, no growth. It’s a matter of time before streaming completely wipes them out."
03/30/2021,stocks,I’ve noticed everything that WSB mentions on their thread turns to garbage. The hedge funds just attack it and short the shit outta it.
03/30/2021,stocks,"I think it is very dependent if HBO and Disney allow them to live. Disney went with a garbage business model and may return to the big screen, but it is starting to look like WB doesn't care and plans on doing simultaneous releases. Which would mean that if subscriptions go up, the movie theater may be empty for the majority of a year after everything goes back to normal."
03/30/2021,stocks,"People weren’t going to movies before covid, once  the novelty of going to the theater wears out it will go back to being a dieing industry"
03/30/2021,stocks,"movie theatres arent coming back

sure, they will in some capacity for those who truly love the experience but covid has made everyone realize you don't need to shell out 10 bucks for a ticket when you can just watch it at home"
03/30/2021,stocks,"I’m in CNK and NCMI since February. I was up 20%-40% on each two weeks ago and now I’m down 10% on CNK and up 5% NCMI.

I figure CNK will be back up before too much longer and I’ll probably average down next time funds deposit.  NCMI pays good dividends on top of potential reopening growth. I like both stocks truth be told.  I’d planned to get into AMC but once it got memed to death I decided to avoid it. Meme stocks are too risky for someone as uncool and perpetually late to the party as me."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Selling covered calls on a certain movie company has paid for a lifetime of movie tickets. 

Saw my first movie in person in over a year and it was magical. I love going to the movies, but I'm not sure the industry will survive in its current form. I'll still go as long as theaters exist though..."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Just some thoughts here:

Godzilla vs Monke is on track to beat Godzilla: King of Monsters and possibly do as well as Kong: Skull Island.  It's the first major blockbuster of the pandemic.  It's currently doing very well overseas.  Domestically pre-purchased tickets are selling pretty well so far.  The big test, which will happen after this weekend, is if theaters can do as well when movies are showing the same day on streaming.

HBOmax will be showing GvK same day for free.  If GvK still does well, even with it for free on HBOmax, then it will be a great sign for theaters.  I personally think streaming will shorten the theater window in the future, people will demand it.  Even more than they've already announced.

Another big test will be with Disney+ charging for Black Widow.  If theaters can make it past this second test I think they'll be mostly fine."
03/30/2021,stocks,Been watching for a dip again. Not touching it without one
03/30/2021,stocks,AMC dilluted like hell.. compare MC to MC pre covid level... they grab the WSB gift with both hands..
03/30/2021,stocks,Your a shill
03/30/2021,stocks,WB has publicly stated that they *won't* be doing the simultaneous releases in 2022.
03/30/2021,stocks,It dipped from $14 down to $9.98 yesterday. Best dip in a couple weeks. Not sure if a better dip will happen before it moons
03/30/2021,stocks,Isn’t everyone that doesn’t agree with your stock pics?? “Your a shill” wish I had a dollar for every time I saw someone call someone else a shill on here.
03/30/2021,stocks,"I didn't realize that, but they can always change their minds. It all depends on their profit from all this."
03/30/2021,stocks,"It's not as profitable as movie theaters. People are not flocking to HBO Max. 

And sure, they can change their mind, but they are writing contracts with movie theater chains for exclusivity...I don't think you do that if you intend on breaking the deal during non-pandemic times.

03/30/2021,stocks,"A pair of scissors don’t make a bonsai master. CRISPR\CAS9 is at the stage where Lentiviral vectors were in the 80s. Genomics are a lot more advanced, so it won’t take 40 years, but yeah, it will take some time and there will be a lot of setbacks."
03/30/2021,stocks,"If you love these stocks at 50% off, you'll really love them when they get cut in half again. 

The mania in tech hype stocks is clearly over IMO. I love a lot of these companies but the stocks are going to need a lot more time before they start going back up IMO."
03/30/2021,stocks,I've looked at this for awhile. I remember reading somewhere that one of their head people mentioned they are still a while off major breakthroughs. But I could be wrong
03/30/2021,stocks,"So what is the cons? Needs to have both sides to be a DD

03/30/2021,stocks,ok thx i have a system to keep track of it and give it a score so it is best to give the score on all the data forever or is there a moment when the data is not relevant anymore?

03/30/2021,stocks,When you find out all the bad news and you still think the positive side is stronger.
03/30/2021,stocks,"As other have said, you will never truly know the company. That's why ETFs are always preferred choice for retail investors. And even if you know a lot, sometimes things just happen. Like I invested in this private equity firm and it turned out that founder was sending millions to Epstein. Stock price took a plunge after the news came out. But how are you supposed to know that kind of thing. In any case, the way I see it for myself, there are 3 levels of knowing. 1) I know very little and just hope equity price will appreciate because of momentum or whatever, i.e. gambling 2) I know something but it's relatively safe company so I don't worry holding those equities because chances of them exploding are low, e.g. ADM, RIO, BHP 3) I know not only financials but also the company's products and done some extra research on top of that. Say maybe I work as SysOps so I know industry and I know what products are good and what products are bad so I invested in certain IT equities.

Overall, however, I must be humble and must accept that I'm not smarter thant the market and I'm unlikely to have some smart insights that are not already priced in. I hope for average returns and anything extra is a bonus."
03/30/2021,stocks,"I personally learned a few things about what you need to accomplish when you research a company.

Macro/meso: What kind of market are they in? How does the economy react? What is the supply and demand? What are the laws surrounding this product? Are they new in the market, are they a market leader, are they persuing the market leader?

Micro: What are their plans for the future? Who is leading the company? What are their plans right now?  How well did their past plans work out? How well do you know their product? Are they selling enough, if so, for how long could they? Are they innovating their products? what is the longevity of their product, is it future proof? How are they treating their employees etc.

then ofcourse, you need to look up their financials.

Revenue, cost of revenue, gross profit, solvency, profitability, EPS, P/E, forward PE, did they do any buy backs?

Last check all the news you can find, scandals, positives, negatives etc.

I think if you finished doing all these things you are doing a pretty well job on getting to know the company.

Disclaimer tho, i just started investing in january 2020. I am still a noob myself, but i have read 2 books so far and i am trying to put in as much effort as i can atm. Its possible ive said someting thats not correct here, forgive me if i did."
03/30/2021,stocks,"You’re right, it’s not possible, which is exactly why most analysts focus on specific groups of industries instead of trying to be a jack of all trades. A finance firm will usually have a biotech team (or one guy) and a agriculture and food team etc etc...

For me personally I have been investing for 11 years and I still completely ignore some industries due to a lack of understanding.

Of course you can prioritize based on growth and current events. There is little benefit to me learning the tobacco industry or the horse carriage industry.

Once you narrow it down to a list of the industries that actually matter it’s a lot less intimidating."
03/30/2021,stocks,"You don’t _need_ to know anything to invest, anyone can buy in and sell out. You could spend hundreds of hours doing diligence and still make a bad choice, there are people do M&A work whose sole jobs is to get elbow deep in a company before they _literally_ buy it and they still get surprised.

The point is to spend energy commensurate with your risk. If you are going to directly manage your entire savings and retirement without funds or ETFs, well you better get researching. If you are taking some of your rainy day fund and hoping to squeeze an extra 10%-30% out of it, you can probably go with minimal time investments.

FWIW- I’ve seen plenty of DD posts on Reddit, in an industry that I work in and am in tune with, and those posts are always deeply myopic to that specific company. They almost always focus on positive upswings only and never consider downsides or what a competitor is doing. (What Could Go Wrong for XYZ Corp.)"
03/30/2021,stocks,Sometimes to much knowledge can prevent you from taking risk.
03/30/2021,stocks,[deleted]
03/30/2021,stocks,"This is pretty much my opinion on how to handle it as well, except I'm relatively new to this, so don't listen to me.

Most forums, youtubers and even analysts do relative valuation (P/E, P/B, PEG, EV/EBITDA etc. comparisons of companies within a sector), but that really has its pitfalls. But it's easier to do and screen for and hey, the guys that made billions 40 years ago always harp on low P/B being king...

As an accounting student I can confirm what Aswath Damodaran often says - that the way you can mask true earnings via depreciation (for example) really skews P/E and PEG ratios often.

Also, the cashflow statement is heavily underrated, it can tell you SO much and if you just decide based on P/E and P/B you can make some pretty bad decisions.

And finally, in 2020-2021 there's a wave of retail investors (I caught that wave, but try not to be like them) that just buy companies whose products they like, without looking at anything. They'd buy Tesla and Apple at any price and some of them probably made over 25-50% returns already, so... It's weird, man."
03/30/2021,stocks,Very well said
03/30/2021,stocks,I just read yahoo finance comments /s
03/30/2021,stocks,I do find it easier to read when the possibility of making money is on the table.
03/30/2021,stocks,There is probably not a 1:1 correlation. How many shares of the ADR are issued for shares of the ordinary stock. Could be that the ADR represents like ~20 shares of the ordinary stock.
03/30/2021,stocks,Thanks that makes a lot more sense I just confirmed that's what the discrepancy was. I'm aware that sometimes the ADR has a premium compared to the common shares on a securities respective exchange but that was certainly too high to be just a premium.
03/30/2021,stocks,That would be a pretty awesome premium 😂
03/30/2021,stocks,You just watch the Big Short? Lol
03/30/2021,stocks,Go to the big banks and tell them that you want to short the automobile financing market. They will create a product exclusively for you. 🦧
03/30/2021,stocks,"ALLY is heavy on auto loans. You can then go long (leaps or buy and hold shares) on auto parts suppliers.

The auto parts stores were booming when auto loan defaults soared 2009-2011. I was working in an auto part retailer distribution center in 2010-2012 and we were booming hiring and opening stores at a time the auto manufacturers couldn’t move volume."
03/30/2021,stocks,"If you're referring to cars on HP from a garage/dealership through a financing company, the 'family of 5' who are paying for the car don't actually own it. In the case that they can't pay back the loan, the car is returned to the financing company who will sell it and it'll be cost-neutral. 

If you mean people taking out bank loans and using the stimulus cheque as a deposit for example, the bank should have done their due diligence as to whether the person being given the loan is in a suitable position. That includes whether their income will continue. If the person can't pay, there are already systems in place that allow money or assets to be removed to offset the loan. 

In either case, the financiers are insured twice basically. Once because they have such a vast expanse of people who are paying to them, if a small percentage default, it doesnt affect the whole operation. And secondly by typical insurance. 

The companies that would suffer if in 4 years time the loans systems collapsed are the small local firms who actually probably don't do their own distribution of loans because that needs a huge amount of capital, and also are probably small enough that they dont distribute shares anyway"
03/30/2021,stocks,"1) Don't use anecdotal evidence to solely guide decison making.  Make sure you look into all publicly available data before making a decision

2) Most car lenders are banks or credit unions.  Even if there is significant default I wouldn't bet against a fin service company that is about to get rate hike.

Good luck!"
03/30/2021,stocks,"This is not a bet I would make. 

I think it is a wrong assumption unemployed people are taking out loans on cars... no bank would loan to an unemployed person right now. If anything, stimulus is exactly as the name implies, a stimulus. People in a position to borrow are getting free money for down payments. 

This does not speak to their ability to repay at all. I would say the only people out there buying cars on credit are ones with jobs. We are not in an actual recession, there is nothing to indicate these people will lose the ability to repay in the near term."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Even before Covid many people where financed to the eye balls and lots of buyers were rolling in negativity equity with almost every trade in.  I saw lots of people trying to trade in and ""downsize"" in an attempt to get lower payments.  I would also argue vehicles are not really holding their value more these days as the OEMs have to continue to pump out new cars, driving down the prices and with EVs right around the corner."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Despite the insane levels of car debt, the situation isn't even close to what happened with the housing crisis.

At worst, the used market would get flooded with repos, driving down prices and causing dealerships and manufacturers to take a sales hit.

So if you were really bearish on the auto market, you would want to short carmakers. But all signs point to their shares continuing to go up.

But I'm not a financial advisor, and probably have no clue what I'm talking about."
03/30/2021,stocks,i think its a little risky to bet against.  Good luck.
03/30/2021,stocks,any auto finance company that is publically traded is not going anywhere. nor lose any large amounts of money...
03/30/2021,stocks,I think you are living in a bubble
03/30/2021,stocks,"Unsecured debt gets ignored before car loans. You can easily short Visa, MasterCard.

That said, I don’t think you’re right about car loan defaults - I don’t think they’re a bubble. All of the indicators are that inflation and GDP is going to go up so today’s loans will seem affordable. Household personal savings rates are up. Consumers are making it work, if anything there is probably pent up demand as people go back to their offices to work."
03/30/2021,stocks,Just did a little googling and CAFI looks like a good target to research.
03/30/2021,stocks,This looks like a bad bet.  Household debt has decreased during Covid.  If people used stimulus for down payments then there is less chance the loans are upside down and less chance a repo would result in a loss.  On top of that interest rates are much lower and auto companies have been offering deals with very low to zero interest.  Basically auto loans may be in a better position than they were before Covid.
03/30/2021,stocks,"Don't - you can be right and still lose all your money. Shorting is not something I would recommend the odds are always against you unfortunately. 

I also think you underestimate how many people got rid of their cars / did not get new ones during covid. I know many who have been stuck at home, sharing a car with their partner the odd time they go out and are going to get a car once they get back to the office. 

Just find something to go long instead its a far easier way to make money."
03/30/2021,stocks,For me you are making a pretty good case to add long positions in financial services.
03/30/2021,stocks,"Except that when those people default on the loans, they'll have to give up the cars, which will then be resold to people who need to take out a loan to finance the car. Seems like kind of a wash, no?"
03/30/2021,stocks,Buy a car and drive 3 states away to live without leaving a forwarding address or making a payment 🤓
03/30/2021,stocks,"Short the automobile companies directly.  Each OEM has a finance wing.  For example, Ford Credit.  I would recommend shorting Ford.  The trucks are very expensive since and I know many men who owe a lot of money on their F-150s.  They also rolled older loans into their newer ones.  You have some people walking around with over $100k in auto debt on a truck worth $40k with a 10+ year APR loan.  It’s nuts.

Don’t even get me started on the dealerships.  Dealerships borrow money from the OEMs to buy their inventory.  If it doesn’t move, they lose out.  Do you think a lot of people were buying cars in 2020?  Many of those dealerships were sitting on inventory and refinanced those loans through the OEMs.  The entire automotive market is a debt mountain.  When rates rise, they will get hit the hardest."
03/30/2021,stocks,"More people can afford their cars than not. Also, when people can't make their payments we have this thing called repossession. I don't think car loan providers are going to get crushed the way mortgage providers did. Also, keep in mind that we are in peak car buying season. This is the time where dealers offer their best incentives combined with stimulus and tax refunds. I wouldn't take this position."
03/30/2021,stocks,I agree with you - Everyone in my hometown is driving a brand new pickup financed for at least 72 months. I noticed it a few years ago and internally think I remember (I'm probably wrong) that it started after the crash in '08 because of Dodd-Frank. Banks needed to increase income and long ass loans at the rates most of the people qualify for helped lessen the loss IMO.
03/30/2021,stocks,"Household savings went way way up during the pandemic, I'm not sure your general sense of this is correct.

Gen X's collective wealth increased.

When car loans default, the lender often makes more money than if they hadn't defaulted, because they get to resell the car, via another loan. Companies understand the credit risk of their clients; if they have solid clients, they just auction off the small number of cars they end up with. If their clients are on the brink, they've got relationships with used car lots to sell that car again and again.

Don't just assume that what looks like a failure means the financial services companies lost money. It may only be the clients who lost their equity.👼"
03/30/2021,stocks,I don't know how it stands up in the current market but Last Week Tonight covered the problems with auto financing 4 years ago. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U2eDJnwz\_s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U2eDJnwz_s)

03/30/2021,stocks,"Automobile finance is secured by the value of the vehicle. Unless everyone crashes their vehicle before defaulting on their payments, I don't think the finance industry will be as damaged by people defaulting on overpriced cars as you think."
03/30/2021,stocks,lol auto loans are not going to collapse the industry like housing did. Nowhere close to the same money
03/30/2021,stocks,If normal people default o loans their asset's will be sized and sold off.
03/30/2021,stocks,Literally short any major bank.
03/30/2021,stocks,I think the people who *do/can pay* their car payments offset the ones who can’t. It’s just a matter of at what point will the ones who currently can will not. Americans have 1.4 trillion in auto loan debt on a depreciating asset. At an average 5.27% interest rate Americans pay almost 74 billion in interest every year. THATS INSANE
03/30/2021,stocks,"If they’re using the money as down payment, now they have a more affordable payment than they would have had. Used car market exploded and most used cars are worth more than they were pre-pandemic. Further drawing payments down. Interest rates on most new cars is also near-zero. This is probably one of the best times to finance a car that we’ve seen in a decade. I sell cars and we’ve been record breaking-ly busy all year. Even in January which is traditionally retail hell"

03/30/2021,stocks,Talk to dodge. IIRC a friend of mine who worked at a dealership told me last year that when people would come in with a ton of negative equity they would often push them into a hellcat because dodge was allowing something like up to 30k of negative equity to be rolled into the new loan.

Yes and no. Although we can't pin the exact moment - we know that Hwang was way overleveraged on margin, so at the slightest hint of something going south it probably set off some serious alarm bells for these prime brokers, and fast. 

$VIAC announced a huge $3bn secondary offering that morning and the stock took a huge hit very quickly. This might've been the beginning of the end for Archegos as a little while after that PR, we see the unwinding of these huge positions from prime brokers on the Archegos stocks (more $VIAC, then $DISCA/K, $GSX, etc.). 

What I speculate happened was that the $VIAC offering announcement got Archegos into some really hot water and they were margin called. They knew right away they were insolvent, and immediately began liquidating their long positions as the prime brokers simultaneously unloaded these ridiculous positions in ViacomCBS and Discovery. 

What I find most fascinating about the entire thing is the fact that, and correct me if I'm wrong, Goldman Sachs was the ONLY broker that actually hedged their positions against the Archegos ones and came out of this whole shitshow in the green. Goldman has a great reputation, but I can't believe nobody else thought to hedge here. It's not like they didn't know exactly what was going on."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Would be interesting to know what prompted the margin call in the first place. After all, the stocks that they were in were on a fucking tear for the year. And basically the fund went bankrupt despite the above. It’s quite confusing to me.

But in all of the above we also see dramatic price drops on Wed. 03/23/2021 (even larger than on Friday for first three).  Was 03/23 just a bad day in the market broadly?

It's just a failure to manage risk and putting too many eggs into the same basket. There are smart ways to use leverage - even very high leverage, but Archegos wasn't one of them."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Did these stocks really 'go on a tear'? My guess is Hwang bot and bot and bot the majority of these shares all the way to the top. It's not like he got in at $14 on VIAC x5 margin and then got dicked down on the pullback from $100.

I bet if you could look back over his trades, this guys bid was hit every fucking day for the past 6 months."

The other thing that I am interested in is whether or not these companies even knew someone had this level of exposure with their stock. It seems like a global resolution would've been for Hwang and the companies to sit down and discuss this and I'm wondering if there was anything to impede that. On the Banking side I assume that GS was one of their prime broker. I'm not sure if GS liquidating their position was their hedge or if they had something else that I haven't seen. I also think MS will come out of the other side relatively fine.

03/30/2021,stocks,"It appears to be as simple as, he made a big bet on VIAC, and VIAC got greedy when they were overpriced and tried to sell too many new shares, which dumped the price. The stock was at 100, they announced a preferred offering at 85, it dropped to 70 because of that.

This may turn out to be the whole story; idiot ""Tiger Cub"" with a shady history went YOLO during the Year of the Stock Idiot, and crashed and burned. (again)

Most of the companies that lost big money giving him leverage had just started doing business with him again less than 2 years ago, after a decade of refusing him as a client.

Lesson: People don't change. Companies can change, with new people. But people don't change.👼"
03/30/2021,stocks,"This is the biggest reason why I never use margin.  You can get margin called because “fuck you, that’s why.”

But if you look at DISCA, the margin call didn’t happen until it dropped under 60.  If he was an active trader and had a high cost basis I can understand how he’d get margin called here.  Fucker probably made a shitload of money before that though...but all his cash was deployed.  What he didn’t expect was that all his picks would be correlated.  But that’s what happens when you momentum trade, you end up accumulating huge amounts of volatility correlation.  He thought he was picking winners, but he was just picking stocks that were getting run up in a crowded herd trade.  Super dangerous if you’re trading on large amounts of margin.  It’s basically turns out like a one stock YOLO."

I did buy some VIAC after this, but it might only be reasonably priced, rather than on sale.

Morgan Stanley had to tell clients that there wasn't any more selling on those equities but that doesn't mean there is still more with other banks or funds. And the fact that there is no way to track who owns what with these swaps makes it harder. I haven't look at the individual stocks, but they could be down for a whole list of reasons maybe they were just valued too high. On the other hand saying why don't the stocks recover is like saying why don't people just start investing when the economy goes into a recession. Its more a behavioral economics question that financial. If everyone just recovered stocks that fell because of market movements then the only stocks that would crash are ones where the company is committing a crime."

03/30/2021,stocks,"It seems like the secondary offering had share dilution which will bring the price down. That price movement probably pushed Archegos into a margin which they defaulted on forcing them to sell all of their positions and then the fire sale started.

03/30/2021,stocks,Probably not. Lehman brothers was in both trading and banking so when its trading side collapsed the banking side was also at risk. I would say that this is closer to LTCM but LTCM had way more leverage and there were more copy cat traders. As of right now we only have a limited amount of answers out there. There could be more copy cat traders and then we find out that the leverage associated with these positions is much greater but based on what is going on  I don't think the fallout will be as big as LTCM.
03/30/2021,stocks,"It depends what banks you are talking about. With Nomura they say "" it was owed about $2 billion by a U.S. client.

We know that the banks met with Archegos to discuss a plan for winding down the positions (FT [link](https://www.ft.com/content/db4508ed-ccb4-48f6-8dd6-dd7d38e3cfa4)). We are unsure whether or not they came to a conclusion. My theory is that they probably didn't. And GS and MS didn't want to wait around taking on the risk that someone may sell before them so they sold first (prisoners' dilemma). Other banks like CS, DB, WF (hasn't announced but most likely), and Mitsubishi UBJ were caught in the fire sale."
03/30/2021,stocks,what part are you stuck on?
03/30/2021,stocks,Goldman was the only prime broker connected to Archegos that went out and bought puts against $GSX and $VIAC
03/30/2021,stocks,"I can’t imagine a scenario where these brokers, especially Credit Suisse, didn’t know the kind of liabilities they were taking on with these total return swaps. 

Take Goldman Sachs for example, they held like 60% of the available shares in the float for $GSX because of these total return swaps - so there’s no way they didn’t understand the exposure they had. 

These brokers *knew* Hwang was exposed to very large percentages of some of these companies **because the brokers were the ones that actually held the shares** while Hwang was collecting premium on the derivatives.

Goldman’s hedge came in the form of a high volume of puts on $VIAC and $GSX - so they may have profited on being the first ones out the door but they also saw profits from their puts."
03/30/2021,stocks,Yeah it looks like these banks may have been giving him up to 95% leverage. Then it’s no wonder why their losses were so big

You really can't. For swaps, the bank signs a legal obligation to your terms of financing in the ISDA and the PB Master Netting Agreement. It gets even more strict if you have a committed financing agreement (OET terms on swaps). And even once you receive the margin call you have a 1-3 day cure period (again, defined terms) before they can label you in default.

I can promise you he was at least under a 30d if not 90d OET, so until he breached on the margin schedule assigned in those legal docs, banks can't do shit."

03/30/2021,stocks,"Leverage is quoted in multiples (gross and net assets / equity). Margin is quoted in %.

The word among traders is it was roughly $85-90 billion in gross assets for $15 billion in equity which would put him averaging 5-6x leverage or 15-20% margin across the PB's (+- depending which PB you're at, Goldman has notoriously high margin even for tier 1 clients while some other european competitors get more aggressive).

03/30/2021,stocks,On the other hand why would a handful of prime brokers give this much margin to them. And why were they able to build sizable positions in equity without anyone saying anything. Because they wouldn't show up in a 13F or in on Bloomberg Terminal as a holder.
03/30/2021,stocks,I would assume that although his family office may be shielded from SEC the prime broker who sold the swaps are still visible to them. On the other hand the SEC didn't say anything beforehand so who knows.
03/30/2021,stocks,I didn't see 5 to 1 to 10 to 1 leverage. From what I've seen his fund had $10bn and was exposed $20bn. And I think the selloff occurred because what most likely happened is that they couldn't come to an agreement to wind down his position so the banks said they weren't going to wait around. I think its a prisoner's dilemma case.
03/30/2021,stocks,"A margin call doesn't care about whether it's smart to hold a position, though. If the amount you have to pony up exceeds what you can put in in other positions or cash equivalents, you have no choice but to surrender whatever you have."

03/30/2021,stocks,"It's everyone's first time learning about Archegos. The reason why is because their equity exposure was built through total return swaps. Which meant that they wouldn't even show up in a 13F (not sure if they have to with them being a family office). I'm not sure where to look at when trying to find other info out there. The question is can you find people who have equity exposure without it showing up and are they leveraged enough where a move could possibly bankrupt them.

edit: I'm assuming when you say what other info is out there you mean what other information about the recent movements and not the history of Archegos. That exists Archegos is run by a Tiger Cub."

Most of the true space plays will take years to pay off. They are well balanced by the Amazons and John Deere’s. There is a good mix of long term growth and short term.

I like the ETF."

it doesnt seem like a space etf at all. when it was first announced, i was shocked since i didnt think there would be enough space stocks to form an etf on and the holdings seem to agree with my thoughts"
03/30/2021,stocks,"She has such a large AUM that she has no choice but to deploy cash into big cap names since they can “absorb” that cash without giving her an outsized stake that prevents her from maneuvering as quickly as she’d like.

03/30/2021,stocks,"Lol no - it seems every year some institutional investors want to try the legacy car vs Tesla story. At the end of the day I think Tesla does better than expected, why would you buy a car from a company paying a dividend and doing buybacks when the alternative is a company investing in innovation to improve the lives of humanity. Making an equivalent car (if they can the tech is behind) is only the start of the legacy problem."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Tesla is innovative. You see their company diversified beyond vehicles. They have energy, starlink and rockets. 

I have 0.03 share of TSLA."
03/30/2021,stocks,"I'm buying as much Voltswagen as I can! I like the company, regardless of their EV move. It's a good move for them I think. Like you said, cars is what they do. And the EV tech is available. It's not like they are going to have to invent it. They also have a well known, and generally trusted brand. They are ""the peoples car.""

I bought VW before the EV news because my first car was a 1972 VW Beetle. It's the only vehicle I've completely taken apart, and put back together again. This EV news is just catalyst for me to buy more than I already would have. And it could raise the share price without a doubt."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Do yourself a favor. Go test drive a top of the line VW. And do the same for Tesla. If you can’t test drive them, just sit inside, it’s enough, I promise. I did the same, and I knew immediately which company I wanted to invest in. Made a bunch of tendies already."
03/30/2021,stocks,"They aren’t even close to being the same company. Tesla yeets money at shit that Volkswagen would never touch. Tesla’s barely even a car manufacturer at this point, they made more selling their carbon credits than they did on their cars. Bitcoin? The fuck? Sure, yeah, if you believe in crypto. 

But what is it that Tesla exactly does? Is it cars? Crypto? Carbon credits? Battery technology? Starlink? Space habitats? Who the fuck knows at this point. Tesla is investing in “The Future” while VW is investing in a car maker. They aren’t in the same ballpark."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Given the difference in manufacturing capabilities, there is no question of Voltswagen replacing Tesla, so much as just zooming past them in the fast lane.

Tesla will remain able to sell their cars, but the stock price seems to act like it is a ""tech stock"" that can scale in an unlimited way, and that's just not the case. Manufacturing is difficult to scale, and it doesn't get easier as you get bigger. And the Musk temper-tantrums with California don't help, because scaling requires good relationships with state governments. And it may turn out that other carmakers are already so invested in the South that the Tesla won't find a favorable environment there just by being anti-California; his competitors might actually prefer to see him stumble, and they've already invested in the local politics.

Meanwhile, VW can just convert existing plants all over the world, retrain existing workers, etc. It is questionable if Tesla was ever even noticeable competition for VW.👼"

03/30/2021,stocks,Strong decision after 3mo. If you disappointed why are you asking? It’s much easier to invest in company you like in people who work there in product! P.s. In Elon Musk We Trust.
03/30/2021,stocks,"FWIW, go pull up a long term chart of TSLA. The 'you are here' point on this chart is a freefall from a massive runup. Tulip bulb mania, roaring 20's, 1999 internet bubble, 2007 housing bubble, all this shit had the same run up before it tanked. 

To get long TSLA, I would like to see what happens in a real bear market or deep correction. If TSLA reaches a low point and bottoms out before the indices, I think it's a solid buy. AAPL AMZN did the same thing during 2008 and it led to a full decade of solid returns. 

Right now, there are too many dreamers and likely bagholders praying TSLA will go back up. But I don't think there is enough margin and speculative fervor to do it. Not after the ramp it had and not in a world where the 10 year is widely expected to shoot up to 2.25%."

03/30/2021,stocks,"When it comes to innovation. Very few countries beat the US ever. And especially when it comes to Volkswagen. 

Spotify was a very good example of a company that came out of Europe that set the trends. But living here in Europe, i don't see the cut throat business practices that make or break you here that you see in the USA.

I can only think Japan, China or Korea are able to innovate. That's my opinion. Volkswagen is just hype. Their electronics have always sucked. I'm betting it tanks"
03/30/2021,stocks,If toyota teams up with tesla its all over
03/30/2021,stocks,This should read Tesla vs Lucid.
03/30/2021,stocks,It’s Voltswagen stupid!
03/30/2021,stocks,You mean Voltswagen?
03/30/2021,stocks,"In a nutshell, your thread ""should I buy Volkswagen instead of TSLA?"" was deleted, so you decided to put some random thoughts altogether and tagged it as a ""Company Discussion"".

Sly move.

It's not only TESLA vs Voltswagen... GM, Ford, BMW, Toyota, Chinese companies (like NIO), Tata Motors. There are many other car manufacturers, all of them investing in hybrids or EVs.

""  looking at the TSLA stock performance during the last 3 months I feel like people are disappointed in TSLA"" I am sorry, but how can I take you seriously after this?

Tesla had an insane rally in 2020, so now we have a healthy and long-time anticipated correction. Disappointed are guys, who lack fundamentals or fresh investors seeking instant gains in a bearish market. Imo a great buy, but maybe not yet.

VW is like the ""Buy the Rumour, Sell the News"" stock now. It will have its momentum for some time, but who knows how it will behave. It's a solid company, so you should make a profit in the long-term eventually.

Personally, I just swing trade some NIO shares, because I like the company and their cars. Plus, some fractional shares of Tesla @$600 to avg down every >10% drop. I am cautious bout automotive industry, so it's <10% of my portfolio."

03/30/2021,stocks,Look it up
03/30/2021,stocks,Only reason Volkswagen is still around is because all the car company’s they own. They will have to do something really special to be competitive with Tesla. The last pic I saw of there ev car or van whatever it was. It was a laugh! Ugliest thing I’ve ever seen. Lol

Does he need to come and say that Elon is a pussy who should fight him before you’ll believe it?"
03/30/2021,stocks,No it was cause no one wanted Toyota’s shitty as design of the old rav4
03/30/2021,stocks,Plus I don’t see anywhere in there does it say he hates Elon or dislikes the company. Just doesn’t believe in there method or way.
03/30/2021,stocks,Lol well why did he team up with him and why are they in takes to team up again lol
03/30/2021,stocks,Yeah I’m sure that it’s all Toyota’s fault
03/30/2021,stocks,"Lol ok, a Japanese ceo of a car company goes out of his way to criticize another ceo and his company with an analogy. The cultural disrespect alone is palpable"
03/30/2021,stocks,"Aight I’m gonna be respectful here and assume you aren’t familiar with Tesla’s history of pumping out rumors.

This story is most likely bullshit and it’s being put out by one reporter in Korea (Toyota is Japanese). No one else has corroborated it yet.

It’s possible, in a very remote sense, that Tesla could be entering into a partnership with them again but I highly doubt it as it could expose Tesla.

Realistically this was leaked to distract everyone from the bad news in media right now which are the shitty Q1 sales, the quality issues in Europe, their Berlin factory construction might get shutdown, the double charging of customers before Q1 close out, another NHTSA investigation, Elon’s tweets about unions and stock price etc.

They’ve had a rough couple months"
03/30/2021,stocks,Lol so Tesla is where it’s at today by rumors?
03/30/2021,stocks,"Depends what you mean by where it’s at?

Their stock price absolutely.

They are real car company though, not disputing that."
03/30/2021,stocks,You do know they are more then just a car company too
03/30/2021,stocks,"Man this is gonna be a big red pill moment for you. You need to dig deeper on the claim that Tesla is more than a car** company. Less than 2% of their revenue is from their energy division.

If ~95% of my business comes from cars, I’m a fucking car company."
03/30/2021,stocks,Stop losses are bad IMO because you haven’t technically lost anything until you sell that position. Your stop loss could be the very bottom. You sell that share then news comes out and the stock jumps 200%. Then again I only invest in things I believe in and hold for the long term expecting them to grow overtime.
03/30/2021,stocks,"Ah, I get it now, In FOREX you need that kind of stuff because of Margin calls and so on. Thank you very much."
03/30/2021,stocks,You’re also vulnerable to flash crashes. Often stocks can gap down at open then will quickly recover.
03/30/2021,stocks,DeGiro has some odd rules around stop losses and trailing stop losses. The most irritating one is the 20% from last price rule on the limits which is a pain for volatile stuff. I haven't quite figured out when they offer trailing stop loss either.  Might the worth emailing to ask.
03/30/2021,stocks,Just pretend they are fake numbers on the screen some days they are up some days down
03/30/2021,stocks,"Because even if you did your DD you still don’t know what’s going to happen. Either way, in the long run, share prices tend to track with intrinsic value so if you have great conviction you just need to mentally prepare to weather the volatility."

03/30/2021,stocks,You're bringing emotion into your trading. Try not to. May I suggest meditating before bed and upon waking up instead.
03/30/2021,stocks,Sounds like not enough conviction in your picks
03/30/2021,stocks,Well if you're anything like me the market has been kicking the shit out of you every morning for a month now so it would be a normal reaction/defense mechanism.

03/30/2021,stocks,I don’t usually nut that late LOL. At night I often get hit with a stimulant like sense of energy. Possible i’m less critical then because I know i’m working better and smarter.

03/30/2021,stocks,"Im 21 years old living in a dungeon. With most of the market being overvalued and my current situation it’s hard to have great conviction when parting with any money haha. 

Like rkt is so heavily manipulated, I have to factor in a lot of stuff beyond the company. Great pick that just gets fucked constantly. While it was a good long term hold, I don’t want it in two years with the current market sentiments."
03/30/2021,stocks,This - I have found that for real high conviction picks it's easy to hold through crazy volatilities including the COVID crash and current tech dip etc. But those companies don't come easily and what companies make high conviction also differ person to person.

03/30/2021,stocks,"Maybe a DCF analysis for your picks could help you get a better (numerical) feeling for your risk-reward based on fundamentals with YOUR assumptions for the future.

03/30/2021,stocks,"Yeah i’m too poor to invest in shit like appl though. I need to build capital, realize shortish term gains and minimize looses. 

Like you mentioned the covid crash. I have a portfolio for that, but im certainly not investing in that right now. Getting caught in the middle will definitely chop me up and i’m aware of that haha. 

Like two years from now I would like to have some realized gains and move into more traditional safer investments. Ideally because of my age the market goes to shit with lots of my cash liquid. High growth/ deep value companies are all I can bare to look at currently. Perhaps an oversight."
03/30/2021,stocks,I’ve been a rkt boy for a long time now 😂😭
03/30/2021,stocks,This is what I was thinking. If that’s the case it seems it would be beneficial to continue this way. Sometimes I fall asleep in my chair looking at the stuff so it’s definitely very fresh for my brain haha.

03/30/2021,stocks,"My advice is to just buy periodically on a schedule and understand the difference between volatility and a fundamental change in the evaluation of a business. As long as the price remains a reasonable amount below what you think it’s worth and matches your expected annual RoR, then periodically buying is way better than trying to weave in and out. No one knows what the market is going to do 10 minutes from now let alone a few days, weeks, or months."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Eh, I see what you’re saying because it’s definitely super unpredictable right now but I feel the longer people sit on their non invested money the more it’ll decrease in value. In a capitalist society you have to keep up whether you want to or not"

April is usually a good month (historically), so I would try to get in by late Thursday in the heavily hit stocks that have strong fundamentals. I think going heavy on stocks like AMD make a ton of sense right around $75, and I'm heavy on PLTR, if you bought around $20ish then your downside is it dropping to maybe $18, but the upside is $35 EOY, so I would buy getting in now for sure."

03/30/2021,stocks,I am a proponent of timing the market - with some reservations. Especially timing one's market entry makes sense to me. I was successful in that when I started stock investing.
03/30/2021,stocks,"I'm not saying try time the market, I'm saying don't invest more than you've put in right now, until there's some momentum going. I'm not saying ""Try time the bottom"", I'm saying wait until you've seen that bottom, and some strong upward movement before putting more money in."
03/30/2021,stocks,"An index gives a rough idea of where the market is moving. It doesn't have to be the Nasdaq, it could be the Dow, the Russell Small Cap 2000, or the S&P, it depends which kind of stocks you watch (growth, value, high market cap). I'm also not saying 1 down day means you should sell. I'm saying if there's a downward trend that has set lower local highs over the past month, then maybe its not best to add more money in, especially if you're long term. P/E is very high on way too many stocks, some stocks with high valuations don't even have earnings."
03/30/2021,stocks,"That is, by definition, timing the market. Ask the millions of people who waited to see the bottom last year and wound up missing the largest bull run in history."
03/30/2021,stocks,Yields rising - banks do well when they can borrow cheaply and lend at higher rates. Also should benefit from being allowed to buy back stock and raise dividend payments.
03/30/2021,stocks,"Banks do better with higher rates because that increases how much they can charge for loans.  In the most simplistic fashion banks take in money in savings accounts and pay you interest (now practically nothing if not actually nothing) and in turn lend that out to others at higher rates for mortgages, car loans etc.  The higher the interest rates the more they can charge borrowers but the more they have to pay savers.  The difference in this is usually a few percentage points.  The problem banks have right now is that interest rates are so low that they are not making their normal rates as they can't pay less than zero to the savers.  Until the   interest rate goes up 2 or 3% banks just get extra profit from higher rates as they can charge more to borrowers but won't pay more to savers.  Eventually if rates get high enough they will have to start paying more on savings accounts but until then higher interest rates just means higher profits which is why interest rates going up is good for banks."

03/30/2021,stocks,"They have tons of cash, fed is gonna lift the dividend and buyback restrictions soon, good balance sheets, profits have returned to pre covid levels or higher, rising rates.

All of that, in a nutshell."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Only one thing changes the price of a stock, the last sale price.  It’s whatever someone was last willing to pay for it.  Old saying “the market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.”"
03/30/2021,stocks,"Someone with better specifics can correct this, but when JPow says “keep rates near zero,” he’s meaning the rate at which the fed and other central banks lend to each other. This is essentially the base rate, meanwhile treasury rates move based on supply/demand(there’s other theories but we’ll stick to this one for simplicity.) 

Banks are able to lend at rates relative to that of treasuries. Treasuries have nil to zero risk so that is the “risk-free rate” of borrowing. Banks are extremely complicated, but essentially what this means is banks can borrow at very low rates and then lend at higher rates. As treasury yields rise, banks can increase rates of their loans(mortgages, cars, etc.), meanwhile the fed is keeping the base rate near zero.

Edit: 
Disfavors for banks:
Yields get too high and demand for loans dramatically decreases(tightening/contracting of credit)
Yields get too low and margins decrease"
03/30/2021,stocks,"If you try to understand it in a 2 directional way like that, then you wont understand anything and will always be confused. Nobody really understands it totally, its a massive system of millions of people all acting for themselves. Just because the fed promises to keep rates low doesn't mean that everyone will believe them or believe that they are capable of doing it. 

>someone please explain simply why people are now piling into financials and the effect of interest rates, and what favors and disfavors bank stocks

my initial lazy hunch is that with SLR ending in less than a day, lots of institutions want to get their money into whatever banks they can as there's a possibility that banks will be forced to reject new money from these investors if they dont want to come up with the increased cash to hold in order to maintain the increased liquidity requirements."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Yeah, under a microscope that's the only way it changes. However it's extremely shallow thinking that doesn't work well.

That sale/purchase price exists because someone somewhere believed that the stock was worth too much, or too little and a trade was made. Influenced by news, company financials, emotions, what have you."

03/30/2021,stocks,Archegos for sure 100%
03/30/2021,stocks,What about $COKE and $HOOKERS?

03/30/2021,stocks,"Nothing wrong with asking stuff here. I wasn't going to buy whatever was suggested to me, I was asking for opinions to see where people are at. Thanks for the advice on VTI."
03/30/2021,stocks,"If you have credit card debt, you shouldn't be investing yet.  In fact it should be, pay off all revolving debt, have a 6 month cash emergency fund.  If single life insurance to cover all debt (and at the very least all loans with a co signer) or if you have a spouse and kids, 7 times your annual salary."
03/30/2021,stocks,Where did you hear ab them?
03/30/2021,stocks,What are your thoughts on QQQ if I may ask? It seems like this is the most mainstream go to SP500 ETF?
03/30/2021,stocks,"I've noticed that they've been down, but even as a beginner I feel like tech is too essential to go anywhere. I don't feel risky about going into it, but out of curiosity, do you think it'll go down a bit more before going back up and I should wait a bit more if I can, or would that not really matter when considering to invest in tech mutual funds? As in that's not really a factor that I should care too much about since it's a mutual fund and not a volatile individual stock?"
03/30/2021,stocks,">They proved their credibility with the NBA bubble last season.


I am also bullish on Disney, but if you're saying that they proved their credibility with COVID safety with the NBA and that will translate to safety and protocol following for visitors... That's just a terrible conclusion. 

The NBA bubble has zero connection to how COVID will be handled with visitors. Zero. It was a bubble. With a professional sports organization making the rules about it. Neither of those are true for visitors in their parks. 

Limited staff and building maintenance crews were the only ones involved in the bubble - a fraction of the staff needed to run parks fully. They proved that those limited few (likely long term employees) could follow protocols. That's the only common ground with the bubble and re-opening parks."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Interesting. Most stocks are going down at the moment so I thought it'd be ideal time to buy, assuming that we won't see another huge crash anytime soon. Especially if we're looking at mutual funds."
03/30/2021,stocks,"We have seen a downfall in $COKE because of the closing of nations and smuggling routes, I suggest you go more local for a stable return like $METH"
03/30/2021,stocks,"There's nothing wrong with asking, but it is absolutely a sign of inexperience. Inexperience is not a sin, nobody is born knowing how to invest. But it's a lot easier to make bad decisions when you're inexperienced because you don't understand the risks you are taking. Like I said, nobody really knows where the stock is going, but understanding the risks and understanding how different sectors behave differently is important if you want to pick individual stocks.

And despite all of that VTI will beat out most individual stock portfolios in the long run."
03/30/2021,stocks,"7 times your annual salary what, of cash reserves for an emergency fund? That's ridiculous"
03/30/2021,stocks,Same can be said for hedge funds continuing to short shares to cover their shorted shares
03/30/2021,stocks,"QQQ actually tracks the Nasdaq 100, akin to SPY for the S&P 500. But QQQ is a good index-tracking fund. Just know it is weighted toward tech companies, so diversify your other picks accordingly."
03/30/2021,stocks,"No one knows the answer - that being said in my experience when things are on sale and the noise seems too loud, buy. Personally I believe the worst is behind us and that theres lots of upside even if it doesn't come tomorrow, next week, or month you have to be patient."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Interesting, yet here you are asking for advice.  How many millions of people with stimulus checks are thinking that it's the ideal time to buy, too?  I could link many articles on why not to invest your stimulus, but it's better for you to google it.  It sounds like you are going to invest regardless of what professionals opinions on the matter are, though."
03/30/2021,stocks,$METH addicts everywhere are keeping more teeth during this crisis.
03/30/2021,stocks,"Gotcha. Thanks for the assurance and encouragement. I will take heed. Personally I'd be OK seeing more posts started by inexperienced people here. I don't want them discouraged from posting anything in the fear of being called out for it. Maybe not all, but most won't just go off buying whatever is suggested on here just because it was suggested to them. To see where people are with their thinking and position is helpful  for me, since no one physically around me is into stocks at all."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Nah, just 7x salary life insurance. So your fam doesn’t get caught holding the bag if you case it."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Life insurance if you have a spouse and kids, that's the rule of thumb.  It covers debt living expenses less the 2nd income."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Right. Got that mixed up, my bad. Checking out SPY, it's very tech heavy too it seems like. If I were to invest in this, perhaps I should look for other MF like total market fund as well?"
03/30/2021,stocks,Thank you for your advice.
03/30/2021,stocks,"Are you being confrontational? Sorry if I'm misunderstanding or if my comment came across as standoffish, but that was not my intention. I thought we were having a conversation so I just wrote what was going through my head."
03/30/2021,stocks,Ah ok. I've never even thought of life insurance. As a single person with no kids what is the benefit of life insurance for me?
03/30/2021,stocks,"I personally like ETFs because they have much lower management expenses than MFs. There are a lot of ETFs for all varieties of indexes, market caps, sectors, and international markets."
03/30/2021,stocks,At the moment the Nasdaq is having a bit of a wobble due to the tech sector taking a beating. Go with SPY and maybe something in DIA which is the Dow
03/30/2021,stocks,No problem good luck!
03/30/2021,stocks,Interesting.
03/30/2021,stocks,"Yah, I think you can name your mom or something. Not sure. I got it through my work and it costs like $10 a month if that."
03/30/2021,stocks,"If you have co-signers, they inherit your debt.  IE car loan or student loan.  If you don't have those things, then maybe costs to bury you, $5K or $10K with your parents as beneficiary.  Typically your group health insurance will provide a small life policy.  Sometimes employers will provide a small policy.  Make sure your beneficiaries are accurate.  SS provides $250, enough to cover cremation."
03/30/2021,stocks,lmao
03/30/2021,stocks,"My hypothesis is that this is a follow-on from the toilet paper shortage last year. Lumber companies probably put more low-grade lumber into the pulper. Couple that with increased home building demand and there you are.


Edit: I looked around. Lumber industry rags blame DIY retail, as people started working on home projects while they weren't at work. There was a huge spike in lumber prices in September, and empty racks at Home Depot were a meme. It settled down asit got colder, but home building has been increasing continuously, and it's Spring, so the project demand is back.

Expect a crash if the supply overreaction runs into people returning to their real jobs."
03/30/2021,stocks,"$WOOD is a popular index

I personally do not like indexes, so I went with a low PE $LPX.

I am thinking about holding it for spring, as the builder demand is high, and then rotating out around summer.

03/30/2021,stocks,"RFP - of the forestry companies best stock price increase YTD, last 6 months and last year. And its forward pe is still just 6. If you look at price to book and price to sale ratios, and ev/ebitda ratio, compared to other forestry companies (wfg, interfor, cantor, lpx, wy) and it is still the most undervalued despite having the largest increase. It had a rough Q4 last year so it’s stock hasnt had the lumber surge price in yet compared to the others. As of right, this Q1 earnings estimated to be the best it will have in over the last decades. 

Go to Keith Gill/Roaring Kitty’s first live stream, august 3rd 2020, around the 9 min mark. He talks about this stock. As of January 2021 it was his third largest holding under GME and some other stock.

Note I’m not a financial analyst. Do your own research and see if it works for your investment style."
03/30/2021,stocks,"If you are open to considering alternates, look at $AZEK. They make synthetic options to lumber that's starting to get popular due to the shortage."
03/30/2021,stocks,"lumber is probably at the peak. as we've seen as of late, what goes up must come down."
03/30/2021,stocks,Your edit is correct. I was working with a pulp logistics importer this summer and we were importing eucalyptus pulp from Brazil for toilet paper.
03/30/2021,stocks,Some of the forestry companies do lumber and pulp and will be having a great year because of it.
03/30/2021,stocks,"Picked up 100 shares of RFP today, hoping it pays off. If not I'll start selling covered calls after earnings at the end of next month."
03/30/2021,stocks,"RFP is literally a sleeping giant. With lumber prices the way they are and the housing market currently booming. RFP is positioned perfect. Not to mention like Ding123456 said, their Q1 will be the best Q1 they’ve had in a decade. Get in now before it pops!"
03/30/2021,stocks,"Correct. But because of what created this surge,  the demand will be elevated for awhile and right now the lumber futures suggest it isn’t coming down significantly any time soon. January 2022 futures currently trading at over 700. May 2021 almost at 1000."
03/30/2021,stocks,And what were we exporting to Brazil for their toilet paper?
03/30/2021,stocks,Ive got a few thousand and it’s been working out great for me so far. Not selling any time soon. :)
03/30/2021,stocks,"Valid point, but if the tenant protection stops soon, I’m assuming foreclosure and evictions could free up the supply of houses and new construction will reduce as a result . Not sure if my logic makes sense, but I hope I’m right... I need lumber to go down!"
03/30/2021,stocks,"I’m not sure what we were exporting. We were only dealing with incoming. We were a stevedoring company. We just unloaded the ships and shipped it to plants all over the US.

Pulp is what plants use to make toilet paper/diapers/ paper towels"
03/30/2021,stocks,Selling CC's or just owning shares is working well?
03/30/2021,stocks,"That will be interesting to see, if/when that happens, how much that impacts new home construction demand. I think the high demand will still be there either way because of how low housing construction has been for the last decade. But who knows."
03/30/2021,stocks,Owning shares and long calls (set after the earnings). I don’t sell CCs. Sorry for the ambiguous wording.
03/30/2021,stocks,"Personally today I've been picking up more FUBO, APPH, and MAXN. I've also been buying lots of HYLN, AMD, and a bit more PLTR.

Last couple weeks I was buying a lot of Genomics stocks (CRSP, PACB, BEAM) and they're still near their lows from this rotation. Just naming some tickers"

03/30/2021,stocks,Thanks for the tips ! CRSR looks good indeed
03/30/2021,stocks,"Thanks, will be keeping an eye on this one"
03/30/2021,stocks,"It's what I believe will be necessary in the future. I do think there's also lots of opportunities in tech right now, since you mentioned AAPL. AMD, NET, AAPL, CRSR just to name a few. 

Also, I'm keeping an eye out for DOCN, It just IPO'd so I'm going to wait and see how it fairs, might pick some up when we finally start seeing bullish signs."
03/30/2021,stocks,I wish him all the luck in the world but I think he gets too much credit for adidas. The brand as a whole has had a resurgence outside of Yeezy. After everything reopens Wall Street will go back to hating on retail.
03/30/2021,stocks,"He loves fish sticks, too."
03/30/2021,stocks,$1B by 2023 would be a 15% increase in sales. Their stock has already gone up 200% from $10 to $30 since they announced the partnership last June. Following his divorce Yeezy will no longer have the backing of the Kardashian media empire which is worth billions.
03/30/2021,stocks,"“Kanye West’s vision”

03/30/2021,stocks,So Puts ?
03/30/2021,stocks,This guy makes me fucking sick.
03/30/2021,stocks,"Agreed! As soon as I heard of his gap collection last summer I bought in. I was cautious so I didn’t go in too deep, so I only got 115 shares at $13 avg. 

I normally don’t like to buy above my average but I’m thinking about doing it. I can see it going to at least $50 once he starts dropping his collection. I may just do some calls, I’ll check out the ones you listed"
03/30/2021,stocks,Truth is Kanye is at the forefront of hype beast culture. If GAP does a good enough job with their marketing the money will flow.
03/30/2021,stocks,"You lost me at Kanye,"
03/30/2021,stocks,"And you don't give him any credit for the resurgence of the brand as a whole? Kanye is a hype maker, his backing has tremendous value."
03/30/2021,stocks,"I disagree honestly. The whole design of the ultra boost and Nmd was partly made by him and his influence had a crazy effect on adidas as a whole. I think that if he hadn’t joined adidas, it’d probably be similar to Under Armour today. That’s just my opinion though, no way to really tell"
03/30/2021,stocks,"Well let's not forget about COVID, it was in the range of $17-18.50 before the crash in March so the increase is not as drastic as you're making it out to be."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Also, Kanye doesn't need the Kardashians to get press, if he's great at anything its marketing and getting attention."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Yup, not like he has years worth of massive results to back it up or anything."
03/30/2021,stocks,He can make you money too.
03/30/2021,stocks,O....Kay....
03/30/2021,stocks,No I know people who work there - non Yeezy items are hot and has zero to do with him.
03/30/2021,stocks,50% above precovid is still alot for a projected 15% increase in sales over 2 years.
03/30/2021,stocks,You severely underestimate their influence and business savvy. As an 18 year old Kylie Jenner made a billion off of lipstick because of their media empire. Yeezy went from a $10M brand before his marriage to what it is today one of the most popular sneakers with popularity on the same level of Jordans. He owes a huge portion of that success to the Kardashians.
03/30/2021,stocks,"Still a massive asshole whose relationship with reality is strained at best. He obviously does something right, but that doesn’t mean it makes the first bit of sense."
03/30/2021,stocks,Lol right ... money > emotions
03/30/2021,stocks,"Kanye West is a multi-billionaire off Yeezy. Let that sink in. Most of it is owned by Adidas. Let that sink in. If he’s making that much, how much is Adidas making. He may not be the reason but he is part of the reason their resurgence has been so massive."
03/30/2021,stocks,"None of that has hindered his ability to sell apparel, if anything it's strengthened it."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Don’t know what that has to do with his business sense or sense of style or ability to sell clothing. Have you seen what he has done at Adidas. 

This is what you call emotional investing. I don’t like the guy but when it comes to clothing. He sells."

03/30/2021,stocks,Not an advisor but sounds like what I’d do. Make sure at least part is going into a retirement account like a Roth IRA or Ira.
03/30/2021,stocks,"You couldn’t be doing righter lol. That is phenomenal. I am incredibly risk averse at most times, but as a younger investor similarly, I would actually allow yourself to park some money into more speculative plays, likely by way of etf’s though. If we have a multi decade timeline in which we can expect returns—arks offerings should be looking good. Your strategy is golden though. Vti is beyond solid—perhaps best in class for its sheer totality. I wouldn’t be afraid to diversify your etf holdings further though either—perhaps qqq, or at least the s&p 500 and dow Jones (dia, for example). 

Again, in a similar category to you myself, I’ve also opted to take on more risk for more reward: I have a base that is big etfs, but I’ve gone into individual sectors and selected the top dogs and  funded them accordingly: for tech, as an example, if you wish to avoid a dedicated fund, you might—after some research and diligence—elect to partition $500 accordingly, as such: one quarter Apple; one quarter Microsoft; one quarter google; and one quarter Facebook. 

With that much of an allocation and that far away as a time horizon, you likely can’t do that much wrong anyways, no matter what, for we usually head upwards overall!"
03/30/2021,stocks,"I'm 20, I work full time and am also paid weekly. I also live with my parents and have almost no bills, (300-400$ a month?). I started investing just before the covid crash as I nearly 30k in my savings from when I was in high school buying and selling things on ROBLOX for usd, invested most of my money during March and April of last year, so in retrospect a great time. I maxed out my TFSA (I'm Canadian) and that has since seen a 125% return last year and then I started investing the rest into a regular account. I'm saving up for a mortgage on a triplex right now so for me personally I try to keep 10k$ in my bank at any given time and I've been trying not to invest it into the stock market until after I get into a triplex, but man it's been difficult to not invest it lately, that's all I want to do haha. 

If I were you I'd consider a similar path and invest in real estate, but if you're not interested in that then I would still try to bolster the savings up a bit while also investing. Maybe do a 50/50 split until you get to 7-10k in savings just as a safety margin (maybe parents might lose job and need help, who knows)."
03/30/2021,stocks,"So I’d tone it down a bit but here’s why:

Investing for the long run is great. But right now you’re sitting on a ton of disposable income with almost no expenses. 

That will change significantly for you in the next few years. You’ll want to move out, get your own vehicle, buy your own food etc. You will go from having tons of disposable income to probably very little.

This isn’t financial advice but in my opinion I would look more into building up nest eggs for a down payment on a house, buy a car in cash etc. 

Solid return on investments is great but even the best investments will fall well below the return you’d get by putting an extra 20/30k on a down payment that you don’t have to pay interest on for the next 30 years. Same goes for buying a car in cash/mostly cash. 

I have tried to buy most of my major purchase in as much cash as possible and over my life it has saved me probably 10’s of thousands in interest payments, which you can then re-invest into stocks/ETF/mutual fund or whatever. 

Stocks are great but have a hard time earning you money when you’re sitting on 50k of card/loan debt adding interest plus a low down payment mortgage. 

The last thing you want to do is then have to pull out good investments to pay down life’s other expenses.

Edit: as an added note, the fact that you’re young in your 20’s and thinking about your financial future in this way is putting you miles ahead of most people your age. So kudos."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Personally, I would start by building up your savings more if I was in your position.

I'd probably do this:

500 to Roth, 500 to taxable, and 1000 to savings

Then once you get your savings higher maybe only put 250 or 500 into that, if anything at all, and more into investments.


I'm in my early 20s as well and I personally feel much more secure having closer to 10k in my savings at all times in case I need cash for something. That way I dont have to sell of any positions I have invested in in order to cover those expenses.

But obviously you have less bills than I do since you live at home, so you might opt for being more agressive than I would."
03/30/2021,stocks,"keep going but also enjoy life. you are young: go out, have fun, enjoy being young and having a little money. oh well... covid... guess keep going then"
03/30/2021,stocks,"That’s 5 months emergency fund cash, sufficient imo


Do you have any debt?  I saw you mentioned  in the comments you already max out a Roth. Imo you couldn’t be doing better 

This is literally what I do, down to the even the fund (I prefer VTSAX but it’s the same shit.)"
03/30/2021,stocks,"You spread it out. 500$ a week is very lucky. Most people have nothing left over.

&#x200B;

1. Invest a little in stocks.
2. Invest a little in bbonds.
3. Invest a little in a savings account.
4. Invest a little retirement account.
5. Invest a little in your community(yes, it matters because if you don't invest in other people one day you'll be left holding the bag). You could come up with some plan such as helping children in some way by increasing their opportunities. Hire them to help clean up the community if it is trash(this then helps everyone overall) or whatever you can come up with. (one day you will be old and you want everyone around you, on the planet in fact, to be happy, else you will end up somewhat miserable and not even realize it because ""that is just the way it is"")

&#x200B;

You have to ultimately figure things out cause it depend son your own personal existence and what your plans are and how you are. If you anticipate major issues in the future(health, maintenance, etc) then you might want an account that you can save for that.

&#x200B;

The problem with savings accounts and such is the very poor return. Your money doesn't grow.

&#x200B;

You are young, you will do fine if you start saving now. Time is what makes people rich besides theft. Compounding interest is your best friend. Learn about it.  If you could invest 1500 a month for 20 years at 10% would be over a million so you might be able to retire in your 40's and then live off the interest you'd make on the million and in your 60's you can use the money to do whatever you want."
03/30/2021,stocks,I would be doing the same except wouldn’t be going into VTI. Your young you can afford to take more risk. Certainly a suitable strategy for many but I would be more aggressive at your age.
03/30/2021,stocks,"Damnit. Sounds like I need a divorce and then to move back in with my parents. I’m super jealous of those monthly expenses.  That’s awesome that you are leveraging that to focus on building wealth.  Keep up the great work.    

$3,000 for savings seems good for $600 per month expenses as long as you foresee your current situation to stay the same.  That’s 5 months current expenses in emergency savings, which is great. Obviously things change if you move out or have kids and shit in the future or plan on lifestyle changes in the shorter term. But with your current setup, I’m jealous as hell"
03/30/2021,stocks,"You're doing great. Let that compound interest work its magic - the more you can invest as early as possible, the better off you'll be down the road. Just remember to diversify, watch the expenses on your ETFs and enjoy the ride."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Buy a small piece of land, preferably with a small house on it (assuming you're single with no kids). Pay it off as quickly as possible. Pay your taxes forward a few years. On that note, pick an area with little or no property taxes. Always pay the mortgage first, then the utilities. 
This will secure your future. Hard times will come but at least you will always have a roof over your head. 
Try to put at least 10% of your income towards retirement. 
These are things I wish I'd known when I was younger. My life would have been SO much easier."

03/30/2021,stocks,[deleted]
03/30/2021,stocks,Yes I maxed out my Roth in a couple months.
03/30/2021,stocks,"Thanks for feedback. I have 15 individual stock picks right now but will trim down those picks to about 10 at the right time. For etfs, I hold VTI, Arkk, arkg, and qqqj atm for more speculative plays as you mentioned. This correction has hurt my holdings in arkk, arkg, and qqqj. Negative on those right now lol."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Also I'd like to add that investing in ETFs and always a smart and safe thing to do. I personally sold all of my ETF's that tracked the SP500 and NASDAQ 100 and bought into individual stocks, which is absolutely more risky, but I also hold some ARKG as my only ETF now. I follow a lot of what ARK does and I love their innovative thinking so I've aligned my portfolio heavily with high growth stocks. Obviously if you're investing into individual stocks there's an elevated risk compared to something safe like the SP500 index, so make sure you spend hours, honestly more like days, researching individual companies before you invest, and make sure you're holding for the long term."
03/30/2021,stocks,Well shit. Congrats on the timing! Those 4 weeks probably gave you an extra 5 years of retirement.
03/30/2021,stocks,[deleted]
03/30/2021,stocks,What are your monthly expenses? I only have car and food expenses. Maybe that is the difference with us. I don’t feel the need for $10K savings personally. Seems too defensive for my current situation.
03/30/2021,stocks,"I like this answer.  OP may be living at home now, but who knows if in the future he'll want to move out?  Buy a car?  Go back to school?  Having cash on hand will be a huge benefit.

It'd also be silly to hold everything in cash.  I like your middle ground solution of building up savings while investing at the same time.

Of course, it totally depends on OP and what his goals and needs are."
03/30/2021,stocks,I’m good. Had a fortunate childhood and traveled everywhere and met tons of celebrities at special events that i was invited to.
03/30/2021,stocks,[deleted]
03/30/2021,stocks,I am. 50% is VTI and 50% is more aggressive stock picks and ETF’s.
03/30/2021,stocks,"After hearing some feedback, I think I will actually boost my savings up a little more. Thanks tho man haha!"
03/30/2021,stocks,I wanna put like 25% towards retirement .
03/30/2021,stocks,Yes to what?
03/30/2021,stocks,"Haha, don't worry I probably won't ever retire :p. I don't have any plans to ever hold down the same job for an extended period of time. Most of my life will be dedicated to just working and saving as much as possible to travel for months/years on end, covid just happened to throw a wrench in those plans haha."
03/30/2021,stocks,">Seems like too much work

Property managers are a blessing for people who don't want to, or physically can't allocate the few hours a month needed to manage a decent property, which is what I'll be doing a lot of the time probably since I plan to spend a good portion of my life traveling for months/years on end.

>Also, since they are physical assets, they can burn down at any time.

Absolutely. It's a good thing there's an entire insurance industry for exactly this reason lol. My house burns down? No worries because insurance will build me a new one.

Edit: I want to add that I live in Canada, so maybe property managers or house insurance isn't as common wherever you might live, though based off your post I assume you're American, which I imagine operates in the exact same ways as we do in Canada regards to real estate."
03/30/2021,stocks,"> I only have car and food expenses.

Will it stay that way forever though?  If you plan on purchasing a home wouldn't saving up a down payment make sense?"
03/30/2021,stocks,"Yea I have about 1300ish in recurring expenses such as rent, car payment/insurance, utilities, etc. and maybe 500 or so more in the other expenses like food and gas. Totalling to about 1800 and leaving me with about 1k in excess cash/month. Probably less if I have anything bigger I have to spend on.

I say 10k because personally, I have a 6500 out of pocket max on my health insurance. So that would leave me with 3500 in savings if I were to ever meet that. 10k is also enough to  cover around 6 months of expenses should I ever need it. But obviously your situation is different and you could be more agressive if you feel comfortable."

03/30/2021,stocks,You have a good well thought out plan. Good job man.
03/30/2021,stocks,I see what you mean. Don’t worry I am enjoying the little things in life. Took a small road trip couple weeks ago with my friend. It was great. Even got pulled over for speeding and the cop let us go lol! Such a good time.

03/30/2021,stocks,"Oh no I definitely am expecting life to hit me like a truck when I’m older and then I will look back at this and feel dumb haha! But in all seriousness, I was built as a saver and am addicted to saving and sticking on a budget."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Haha, I prefer being on my own and traveling on my own, so I don't see anything longterm happening."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Depends where you live, depends on the property and it depends on the company. These numbers can range wildly, it can be anywhere as long as 5% and as high as 15% of the monthly rent, and some companies charge a flat fee of say 50, 100, 200$ per month. Completely depends where you live. It eats a fair bit of the profit, and it could even cause you to go cashflow negative, but real estate can work as a piggy bank because if you ever need cash you can simply refinance the mortgage, which is what most people do to build a 'real estate empire'.

My overall goal with real estate is to have a free place to live. I want to spend months/years on end traveling (without working during that time) so it's important to me to always have a place to come back to and call home as a safety net. Of course family members are always an option for me, but the benefits you see with real estate are great and for me personally it just makes sense to own real estate, especially given that I live in a very cheap market in Canada. I wouldn't even mind coming out of pocket a hundred bucks or two hundred bucks a month in the end tbh, because even then it still makes sense, but overall the goal is to be cash flow neutral, and if I'm able to be cash flow positive then that's just a bonus. To buy a 250k$ house being paid down for me with all of my living expenses related to the house being paid for by the tenants, except possibly 100-200$ a month coming out of my own pocket would be a no brainer."
03/30/2021,stocks,I know :)
03/30/2021,stocks,"Just remember that rent is a double hit if eventually you’re looking to buy. Not only is the money that could be saved for a house now paying for that rent but unlike a house, when you walk away from renting the value of the money you put in doesn’t come with you."
03/30/2021,stocks,"We all say that.....till we meet the right person.....

Don’t worry though. I’ve done both and there’s plenty of time for it all."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Good point BUT with home ownership comes yearly property taxes (CA), maintenance, and other shit breaking that you have pay for. In the end, it seems evened out to me."
03/30/2021,stocks,"No it’s not. Because you OWN the house. It’s literally why people buy property to rent to others. The money is in owning not renting.

Edit:spelling."
03/30/2021,stocks,"You are likely to get better returns in the stock market then on home appreciation so you are right to be skeptical on the benefits of home ownership. That said, if you can afford to invest and own a home then I think it can be win-win. Once you get older you might see more value in owning property."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Flat return rates, yes. But that’s not the entirety of the picture and why good investors usually have both in their portfolio. Now the argument to actually owning real estate as an investment can be made either way depending on your tastes. But that’s much different than the place you call home. It is vastly better long term to own your residence than rent it. If it wasn’t, literally no one would buy houses."
03/30/2021,stocks,I agree with that. I think I would like to get wealthy from stocks and then buy a place with my gains.
03/30/2021,stocks,Where are you going to live while you make these gains?
03/30/2021,stocks,"Like I said, rent. Not like there would be risk of eviction if I pay my rent to a professional real estate company."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Ok. So simple economics then. Scenario 1) you pay approx 1000 in mortgage each month (250k starter  home with 5% down payment) or 1000 a month in rent and every month you contribute another 1000 a month to investments. (Probably not realistic, but I’m keeping numbers simple). 10 years later our situation ends. 

Scenario 1) the home you bought has annual appreciation value 2% (most cities are significantly higher than that) so after 10 years You turn around and sell it for 275k. Of that 275k you’d owe the bank about 120K to close out your mortgage. If you decide not to live in a house anymore after You’ve now got 155k plus the 120 000 you’ve also put into your stocks or ETF’s over that time which have also grown at say 7% per year. 

Scenario 2) you pay 1000 in rent every month (and I’m going to be generous and say that includes ALL utilities). Again you also invest 1000 each month in stocks. 10 years later you move out. You now have 120k in those stocks plus their growth value and ZER0 in return for the 120k you’ve paid in rent. 

There are many reasons to rent instead of own. But if you are talking purely financial. Ownership is always going to be better. Just thought you should understand it before you dismiss it.

For someone that’s big on returns of investments, renting is literally a black hole for your money"
03/30/2021,stocks,"Ahh good way of putting it. Thanks! 

1. I live in HCOL area tho where mortgage would prob be more like 2K a month and $500K home. Would I use the same scenario you mentioned?

2. Why wouldn’t $1K monthly invested not be realistic? What if gross household income was about $120K?"
03/30/2021,stocks,"Yes it applies for every scenario. If a 250k house in my area is 500k in yours then what I’d get for 1K in rent is 2k for you. You mentioned repair costs etc but you have to remember the “presumed” costs of upkeep in any rental property is built into your rent. I build it into all of mine. It’s never free. 

2) gross income of 120k would net you about 7k a month. Plenty of money, if you budget right. But you’d be surprised how fast it goes once you live on your own, own a vehicle, have other expenses or dependants. 

All I’m saying is this. You’re in an envious position to make a lot of good choices for your future financial freedom. Owning the place you live in will always win over renting.

And I mean 1K in purely stocks. 1K in diversified investments is different."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Would you consider a mortgage being like an investment? If so, then I would definitely be on team mortgage over renting."
03/30/2021,stocks,"A mortgage is like buying stocks on margin with FAR less risk. People use margin as a chance to significantly increase their earnings when they don’t have a lot to invest to begin with. 

Mortgage is kinda the same in that say you have 50K to buy a house A mortgage will let you buy a 500k instead. Yeah you have to pay it back with interest but the profits in its growth are all yours. And since home values will never decrease like stocks or options as long as you make your payments you’re never gonna get margin called."
03/30/2021,stocks,What if the housing market crashes? Home values crashed like 80% in 2008 right?
03/30/2021,stocks,"Yes and no. It’s far more complicated than that. It was the house financing market that crashed which caused the entire world economy to crash. As much as houses lost value, the markets lost just as much and more. 

If you had stocks in the wrong companies that went bankrupt you would have been left with nothing. If you had a home, even if it lost value, you still had a home. Most people who lost their homes where the ones who took out NINJA loans and never should have had that house in the first place. 

As well, houses on average lost 30% but since then have climbed 30-50% over their pre-2008 value. 

Also I think you’re Canadian? We had and have a lot of consumer protection laws that prevent that from happening here and saved a lot of people 2008."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Haha no I’m not Canadian. Is the financial crisis a pretty rare thing? Is there any risk of something that extreme happening again? If so, what would cause it?"
03/30/2021,stocks,"Ahh that was someone else commenting on the financial vehicles here. No worries. 

And crashes happen and another one will happen. It’s a guarantee. When is anyone’s guess and how they happen and what they affect can be completely different every time. Housing crisis, COVID, Dot-com bubble, or just craziness like Black Monday. 

But time in the market and diversified portfolio will get through it. If you had put 100k in the markets day before the crash in 08 and kept it in through even the 20 crash until today you’d still be out ahead. That’s why time in the market is the biggest factor.  Just diversify and give yourself time. 

Last thing about owning vs renting. As a good example. I bought my first house in late ‘07 for 195k. It lost some value in the next year (no idea how much) but I sold it for 345k in December 2019. Which in hindsight was the worst timing ever cuz I could have probably sold it for 400 today. But I was mortgage free and wanted to put it into buying my forever home.  It had also became a rental home 7 years prior to that. So I made 150k clean profit while having someone else pay my mortgage (plus a little extra) for the last 7 years. So in essence I was making money off people paying for something that was making me money just sitting there. At the same time, these renters left after 7 years with absolutely nothing of future value for the money they paid me. 

Whatever your future situation ends up being. Every penny you can put into ownership that doesn’t go into someone else’s pocket as rent is a dollar you’ll be ahead later."

03/30/2021,stocks,"The institutions have analysts who actually meet with management, tour the companies and manufacturing facilities. They travel to places to check out supply chains and factory floors. They spend a ton of time meeting with industry professionals and experts. A good analyst can tell you exactly what the business plan is, what the risks are, what the opportunity is. They do not do DD via google. They’re as inside as a non insider can get. You’ll never get that access. 

Beyond that, it’s being very enmeshed with the industry. Biotech, for example, if you’re waiting for news to show up on CNBC or Bloomberg, you’re late. You’d want to keep the latest tabs on research publications, academic papers, journals, and industry specific publications. You’d want to have medical and scientific experts on call to evaluate any claims or progress that comes out. You’d want to monitor pipelines and FDA announcements. 

Basically, if you really want to be first, you need to put in the work and few of us have time for that unless it’s our full time job."
03/30/2021,stocks,They usually have analysts that predict the future with earnings and company specific stuff. Or have friends in governments and news sources. They get the word before anyone can even type up a news article.

Everything,  this is their full time job."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Better response than mine TBF, so have an upvote. I still think algos are playing a huge part though."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Following on that, how does bloomberg get the news first then to put it in their terminal?  Regarding the algos, is it even realistic to make one that could trade like that if you're not an institution?  For ex gap ups or downs could probably happen in even less than a single minute"
03/30/2021,stocks,"For sure algos play a role but keep in mind the large institutional players would never let an algo buy/sell a sizable position based off a computer’s reading of a news report because of risk tolerances (what happens if Bloomberg is wrong?) It’s a human pulling the trigger unless you’re talking about HFT. Algos do help provide factors that analysts then use to make their decisions especially in the quant world. For example, a computer can read an earnings release or decipher an earnings call transcript way faster than a human can, but ultimately it’s going to be a human verifying that interpretation."
03/30/2021,stocks,"You're misunderstanding, bloomberg terminals just let traders trade in premarket and afterhours, and set up their buys and sells before the market opens, they don't just wait and act based on news articles or press releases, they act before them in anticipation of events based on industry research and probably lots of insider access."
03/30/2021,stocks,">bloomberg terminals just let traders trade in premarket and afterhours, and set up their buys and sells before the market opens

I see, why do they use a terminal to do this as opposed to just logging into some brokerage that supports those features?  Asking this not saying they should do the latter, but just wondering what the advantages of the terminal are in this respect

Regarding acting, wouldn't we see significant price movement as they act before the news break, but the huge movement always happens after the news breaks?  Wouldn't that big movement be the institutions, but if they were anticipating they would have moved the price before right?"
03/30/2021,stocks,"You cant trade after hours or premarket without a terminal. They cost  24,000$ a year on lease. Those large price movements do happen, you can see it in action when you look at a chart and see a huge green candle with millions of shares in volume. The issue is you need to have buyers or sellers who can fill orders that big when it comes to institutional buyers. Thats why you dont see it happen off market hours, because the volume isnt there for the most part and its essentially hedge funds and market makers trading amongst eachother."

03/30/2021,stocks,"Be extremely careful here.  It sounds like you're actively trading on your paper account.  All it takes is one single slip to completely screw your account and it will take you a long time to pull out of it.

Your $20/day means you are trying to track 100% in annual gains.  You will not do this.  You can get lucky (and it will be entirely luck) and have great gains occasionally, but it will not be the norm.

Being in the green every single day is absolutely impossible.  You will take losses and the probability of losses increases exponentially when you're actively trading."
03/30/2021,stocks,Everyone is a genius in a bull market
03/30/2021,stocks,"It sounds like you're good at living within your means. I would just caution that having $5,000 is still a very long way from being financially secure. Earning $20 per day is about $5,000 per year (\~250 business days). Doubling your portfolio in a year requires taking a lot of risk with a very high probability of loss. It's not a realistic target."
03/30/2021,stocks,"I really want you to understand paper trading is EXTREMELY different than real trading.  You don't understand how much your emotions mess with your logic center until you experience it.  It still to this day blows my mind how I can go from ""man things are really working out.  I love all my positions, can't see changing my mind anytime soon"" to ""fuck, why did I take this stupid position!?  If I had just been more patient or less greedy, etc, I'd be much better off"" in one day.  I've had +$1000 days and -$2500 days.  But it still blows my mind and YouTube and the media don't help either.  

If I were you Id trade for real.  Take about $500 and when you turn it to $1000, then add another $1000.  Turn 2-4k, then add a bit more.  But if you go from paper to 5k the worst thing would be you turn 5 into 6k.  I'd almost guarantee you turn 6 into 3 in a month.  

It's a tough game.  I've immersed myself for the past 3 years and still will have months it's a 0 sum game.  Just when I think I'm pulling ahead one stupid trade will knock me back to square 1.  The long holds are where the consistent growth happens but I'll keep trying none the less.  I spend about 4 hours a day learning listening and tinkering."
03/30/2021,stocks,"I really don't want to rain on your parade because you seem genuinely happy about this, but a month of making money is nothing, you really have to practice for quite a while longer before you can be confident it wasnt luck, especially since you said you tanked a few times before so you're essentially cherry picking this most recent data point because you like it.

You attribute that change to learning more but the fact is you havent spent enough time in paper money to find out if that's actually the case or if it has just been luck. Keep this going for at least a couple more months before you take the full dive. Waiting that long won't kill you, but diving in before you're ready because of false confidence could tank your savings."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Paper trading is nothing like IRL with money. You're gonna be in for a shock.

03/30/2021,stocks,"Man it says here you been paper trading so you haven’t made anything. Once you start really trading it’ll probs go tits up because emotion is strong when trading. Gotta fight it. East when it’s not real money on the line.

Making money every day in one of the craziest bull markets / recoveries in the history of the market isn't an achievement. A wooden red duck with springs attached could have practically doubled a portfolio if it started last year. 

$20/day on $5000 is over $7000 a year

Depending on the jurisdiction:

- you may not even be allowed to have $5K in cash (for example, in parts of Canada, if the disability office finds out you've managed to save up cash, or someone has gifted you something valuable, they cut off your benefits to force you to spend it)

- if you start making money, you may get kicked off your financial assistance (for example in the UK, if you're on benefits and they find out you had any kind of paying job, they kick you off benefits and it takes 6 months to reapply, even if your job was temporary and isn't paying you any more)

- in the US you may make just enough money to lose access to healthcare

- be careful of how your financial situation affects family members - for example, in Canada if a person on disability is married to someone else who gets a paying job or has other sources of money, they lose their disability benefits because the system assumes the spouse makes enough money to support them both

If any of the above happens and then your trading account goes down, you'd be in a world of hurt, so make sure you have an additional social safety net in case you make enough to get off benefits but not enough to live on."

03/30/2021,stocks,"similar situation here, 23, disabled, unable to hold work, very low income area, unable to drive so stuck with parents. investing has been the only thing so far to give me hope, an emotion i had all but gave up on. the only thing i hate is having so little entry funds to make anything of it substantial but that has motivated me into trying to find money to put into the system. 

As for risk it depends, im in a stable house that even if my parents die i get inherited, its just i have zero things to do, horrible internet, etc. so i 0 prospects locally and i just want to get away. For me im ok with the risk cause its a case of either i get to start my life or i end up back where i was before i started. for you i can only hope you are stable if things fail, if you can thats great if you can't see what you can do like disabled housing.

The biggest issue is the US disability system has a cut off. with net value of ~$2000 you will start to be cutoff until you get under the net threshold again. I can't really give advice on what to do for that because that counts as fraud to avoid the cutoff, but what you need is a system to get enough money that you can get a monthly return the matches the disability income you get (which for me is $730) while still growing value so you can keep the same quality of life you are used too while still being able to grow over time."
03/30/2021,stocks,"I'm not an experienced trader, but all I can say is the courage you feel making trades on paper is nothing like moving actual money around. Especially when you don't have a lot to your name to begin with.

If I'm completely honest, it doesn't sound like you should be trading at all. Not until you have a sizeable savings where a few hundred to a few thousand dollars loss won't hurt you. It's so tempting in a bull market to want to jump in and play your hand. But the market is really wild and unpredictable. Even the best DD gets laid to waste and every day is a chance to win big or lose it all."

I figured out that most of it is fluff, and I learned to read between the lines. This is how I stopped blowing through my accounts, this is the 1st account where I am actually making money consistently on a daily basis.

I can't mentally handle college or any school environment without having a mental breakdown and I only have my GED....just going out and getting a job (during a pandemic no less), is not likely, seeing as how I've been trying for years my dude.

Do people seriously read my post and think ""maybe this disabled person haven't thought about getting a job yet!"", because I have, and have tried, many, many times, even just minimum wage jobs. I can't drive, I can't be around dangerous stuff (like deep fryers, construction and fast moving heavy objects) without worrying about getting seriously injured, I can't emotion very well except when I'm by myself, I can't move very well or be in 1 position for very long, what else am I supposed to do?

FTR I grew up in a town out in the middle on nowhere, with a population of 500 where it was common for people to shoot animals for and hit them with their trucks for fun, where a fun weekend was tossing aresol cans in a bonfire, smoking meth and raping children. I was top of the class at my school and I love learning, so yeah, I am actually smart. I may not be the smartest person, or a Ivy League graduate, but I'm pretty fucking smart for someone who has nothing and came from nothing.

This latest account (the one I'm talking about) was meant as a test run to mimic what I am going to be trading with IRL, when I do finally decide I am ready to trade.

They don't punish me for any amount I have in my accounts either. if I were to get a actual job however and made over a certain amount, I could lose it because then I wouldn't be considered disabled at that point, but I could get right back on again if I needed it and failed to uphold a job."

03/30/2021,stocks,"The issue with paper trading vs real trading is actually volume. The methods you stick to are going to *have* to change when you enter the market with real money. I was where you were with paper trading. Heck I was where you were even trading real capital for a while. But something I don't see anyone talking about is how liquidity kind of...shifts as soon as you enter your trades on the tape. This is especially a major issue now with volume and liquidity being sucked right out of the market. Because now you're exposed on the tape and I can (and have) learned how to not play the price, but the people on the other side of my trades. It becomes less of a skill of data analytics and becomes more of a skill of things you'd use in a game of poker.

Also *because* I've been where you are I know you won't actually believe what I'm telling you until you experience it yourself, and that's fine. I'm just letting you know that it'll happen and maybe having that in the back of your head will help you when you get to a certain level.

Basically what I'm saying is that paper trading is easy for the same reason playing against AI on a computer is way easier than playing pvp in any given video game. The situation and game looks identical, but what happens and how we can cause others to tilt on purpose when we throw an unexpected move at each other fundamentally changes and snowballs your approach to the game everytime."

It sounds like you've found some joy in the prospect of trading stocks.  Like others, I'll tell you that $5000 stake without very advanced skill and risk taking won't be sustainable.  But maybe give some thought to what it is about the stock trading concept that motivates you.  The hours? The autonomy?  The industry? The analysis?  Once you know that, you can flip that into figuring out what jobs have those same attributes.  If you're excited to be making an extra $20/day, you may be even more excited for $100/day from a job, plus the job pays you regardless of how the market does.

7% *yearly* return is a good amount, heck professionals struggle to return more then 7% yearly over several years. Its easy enough to think its simple but once things go south...they do so quickly.


And seriously dude. You've already nuked 7 (!) papertrading accounts due to losses. This tells me you *don't handle downturns well* and shouldn't trade.

If I read correctly, while the loss isn't deducted immediately, the loss is added to the purchase price of the next lot, so the tax deduction is not lost, it is delayed. Yes?

03/30/2021,stocks,"No you don't. Check your brokerage website. You can probably enable being offered participation.

You may be required to buy round lots (multiples of 100), but if you consider 100 shares out of your league you should probably stay far away from IPOs, which are more risky than established shares."
03/30/2021,stocks,Yes but what this person is saying price listed at IPO is impossible to execute on. It will jump (initially) to a price that is above list and then you can execute your trade without restrictions.
03/30/2021,stocks,"Apologies if I wasn't clear (or if my understanding is wrong)

Pre-IPO: usually only insiders/venture capitalists that will buy the stock, will often be subject to lock-up when it goes public.

Post-IPO: stock will jump so you buy at whatever the publicly traded price is (will almost always be higher than IPO price), but you can trade freely

There are websites (such as Freedom24) which allow you to register for IPOs and buy at the ""IPO price"", but you **will** be subject to the lockup (it states this on their site)

Feel free to correct me if wrong."
03/30/2021,stocks,"That's a peculiar service that Freedom24 runs. It's not normal broker practice. Why they do it is a mystery; it's not a good thing for investors, it's only good for issuers and middlemen.

Locked-up shares are worth less than tradable shares. They have a negative time-value that decays up as the tradeable date approaches. You have lent your cash to the seller, and get paid your property only when the lockup expires.

03/30/2021,stocks,"May not happen. They appear to be talking about doing a ""direct listing"", which is when the company cuts the investment banks out of the loop and allows the private shareholders to sell to the secondary (i.e., retail) market.

https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/01/uipath-and-databricks-set-up-for-direct-listings-with-latest-funding.html

The purpose of it is to make the public bid for shares on the book and let the private holders decide when to fill the bids, so any pop in the price goes to the VCs instead of to traders allocated shares at the set IPO price.

Which takes all the profit out of being allocated shares."

Earlier this year I realized about $22.5k in gains, then purchased some stock only for it to fall 40%, and I'm currently sitting at an unrealized loss of $25k. I originally intended it to be a long-term hold, but I also am worried about the tax implications of my realized gains come the end of the year so I'm thinking I should consider selling.

03/30/2021,stocks,"My personal view is to try to “harvest losses” only for investments you are looking to get out of anyway. 
Imagine how you’d feel if that stock recovers in the 31 day period you are waiting to avoid the wash sale. 

You also have a lot of the year left. 
I’d recommend setting aside some cash to cover the capital gain and make this decision in December."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Do you have trader tax status?

03/30/2021,stocks,"How would you feel if the stock proceeded to shoot up shortly after you sold, but you couldn't buy back for 30 days and still claim the loss? If you'd be okay with that mentally, then I think this is a good idea. Also, consider moving that money into something that may track the stock or ETF but not contain the same exact holdings, so you'd still be exposed to a potential run up if it did happen while you were waiting for 30 days to expire."

03/30/2021,stocks,"It's not a loss until you realize so this plan does not make much sense to me. If you're going to buy back in it would make sense to just do nothing for now as you have time ,basicslly until December to make a decision. And if it goes back up then your gains will be more.

Unless youre planning on selling and NOT rebuying , then do it."
03/30/2021,stocks,100% yes. You can buy a call contract for a month cheap which would protect you if it goes up but the net savings would definitely be worth it.

remember this is supposed to be money youre ok with gambling and not needing in the short term"
03/30/2021,stocks,"The tax implication of your realized gain is that you get to keep 60 to 80% of what you gained.

If you think that this thing you're about to sell is going to go up again, don't sell it now. But if you think it's dead money or going to go down more, then sell it because it's right to sell it.

Can I ask which stock you’re holding that fell 40%? 
Your tax question is valid. We also just had a rough last two months across the market and an April rally is possible (historically it’s a great month for the market.) 

Personally I would hold it. I’ve seen 25k+ losses before and if they don’t fully recover I can at least wait for a better exit."
03/30/2021,stocks,I would still do it. Move the money into something else you have similar conviction for that may also be down in the same timeframe. I would off set the gains.

03/30/2021,stocks,A little brother lol. I've talked about it in my post history
03/30/2021,stocks,"For that particular stock, and this is just my uneducated opinion, I would hold onto it. Since you stated it's a long term hold then you should be OK with waiting it out rather than risk missing out on any sizable increases.

2021-03-30 19:25:48,stocks,"Question about Supplementary Leverage Ratio What are your thoughts on the SLR expiration? Are some people overreacting, or is there an actual cause for concern?

I was looking for the change in ratio back last March, and the change seems to be a 1% difference. 

>The supplementary leverage ratio generally applies to financial institutions with more than $250 billion in total consolidated assets. It requires them to hold a minimum ratio of 3 percent, measured against their total leverage exposure, with more stringent requirements for the largest and most systemic financial institutions. The change would temporarily decrease tier 1 capital requirements of holding companies by approximately 2 percent in aggregate.”

However, I believe the quote below is why most people are counting on their to be major issues. It seems like banks would have been accounting for this over the past 9-10 days after the Fed's announcement, that there would be no changes and they would let the changes to the SLR expire.

>The change would exclude U.S. Treasury securities and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks from the calculation of the rule for holding companies, and will be in effect until March 31, 2021.

Source: [https://www.swfinstitute.org/news/84939/what-is-the-supplementary-leverage-ratio-and-why-is-it-important](https://www.swfinstitute.org/news/84939/what-is-the-supplementary-leverage-ratio-and-why-is-it-important)

In addition, it seems that larger banks may have always needed to keep a 5% SLR to deal internationally and also keep a bit of a buffer. 

Source: [https://www.fitchratings.com/research/banks/us-banks-sufficiently-capitalized-to-withstand-slr-expiration-22-03-2021](https://www.fitchratings.com/research/banks/us-banks-sufficiently-capitalized-to-withstand-slr-expiration-22-03-2021)

I get the expiration could cause volatility in the bond market, which will have a direct effect on the stock market, but I do not see this as causing a market crash like 2008 like some have stated. I also think that most banks and hedge funds would account for this after the Fed's announcement (meaning this could be priced in). The Fed also seems open to change, if this has huge adverse effects.

Am I just completely missing something here? Sometimes Reddit feels like a ZeroHedge article, but then again, the mainstream media seems untrustworthy. I have seen some analysts asked about SLR expiration, and they have said that the change is minimal. On the other hand, some redditors are really calling for a market crash because of this. 

My positions since 2015 have been all in tech. I am seriously debating if pulling out for a bit would be good, to see what comes. This is a pretty big decision for me, as I am also sure I would have to account for cap gains tax in doing this when liquidating/rebuying in my positions. If I do this, I probably would rebuy back in to VOO/VTI instead. I know probably the most common suggestion will be cut from my winners and invest in VOO/VTI anyways. I just think I can do better than 10% per year returns myself. And from the articles I have read, the SLR rule was changed to allow banks to do more lending to households and businesses, so it seems like it would hurt the banks bottom line more than anything else in terms of revenue."

03/30/2021,stocks,"I fully believe a market crash is coming due to the overvaluation that is rampant across the board but especially in tech. SLR expiration may be a gradual sell-off or it could be corrected en masse immediately. This very well could be the tipping point that kicks off computer sell-offs. 

I’m heavy on $SQQQ, the triple-leverage ETF shorting the NASDAQ, and it has been serving me well in the past few weeks. I just don’t see how this market is sustainable with unemployment still so high, unimpressive quarterly reports, and impending evictions following the moratorium. Speculative economic recovery is already priced in to the market, but we can’t deny that stocks are being propped up by celebrity-run SPACs, overzealous hedge funds, and newbie retail investors. 

When the shoeshine boy is recommending stocks, it’s cause for concern."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Personally, I do not care if a shoeshine boy gives me investment advice. I'm not a pro. I think the ease of trading now has made it so the shoeshine boy can talk about stocks, which I think is a net positive. The downside is people expect massive gains in a short period of time.

That means the education is pretty poor, as most people just see massive gains with options online, and are trying to emulate the same results.  Or don't realize some posting huge gains are scams seeking membership fees/class fees or pumps. I've had some friends who have YOLO'd their accounts, and obviously it did not work out well. 

&#x200B;

Back in 2015 when I started seriously investing, the sentiment was the same about the market crashing but the boogie man was different. It was raising rates then. I started way earlier than that, but I just bought stuff I knew and honestly did no DD. Actually it was very similar to this time, oil and commodities were on fire. 

Regarding tech, I agree, some of it is overvalued. Some companies are way overvalued their current evaluation. However, back then they were saying TSLA and AAPL were way overvalued and their crash was impending. Now it is sort of an overall sentiment that AAPL is a safe haven for funds. I believe the reason for is most importantly the ability to acquire companies. Free cash flow makes a big deal. Part of the bear stance I read for tech back then is these companies need to always innovate, which I have come to realize isn't true. Companies like AAPL can just acquire new companies and companies come to them with their ideas. For that reason, I cannot put a fair value on AAPL, MSFT, etc. 

Regarding unemployment, I agree overall. The job report also doesn't do a good job of letting us know the quality of jobs.

Regarding housing, I somewhat agree this is true. The regulations to get a house after the 08 crash vastly changed the security of the housing market. I was really surprised that housing value skyrocketed during COVID times. 

I do think the SLR expiration will cause a disruption in the market tomorrow or even end of day today. I also agree that if it does have a major effect, it will most likely be a slow bleed. However, I'm not seeing why this is really a huge issue that the SLR expires. As I pointed out in my OP, it seems like banks would already be correctly in SLR regulation."

03/30/2021,stocks,Thanks a lot. I appreciate you answering a nooby question without being condescending. I'll look into LEAPS!
03/30/2021,stocks,"Buying deep ITM LEAPS also allows you to sell OTM calls against it, generating additional income. It's a diagonal spread strategy, also know as the Poor Man's Covered Call."
03/30/2021,stocks,"So if AAPL is at $119. Buying $118-strike price calls expiring next year is ITM. 

And buying $113 -strike price calls is DEEP ITM

Correct? How does is simulate owning shares though? Explain pls"

03/30/2021,stocks,[deleted]
03/30/2021,stocks,"I mean deep deep. Like buy the $70 strike. 

Delta is the degree to which the option contract price and underlying price are correlated. So if delta is .98, that means for each $1 the underlying goes up, the contract goes up $.98. In this way, it’s like owning shares because the two move up and down relatively equally. The difference, and benefit, is you paid way less for the contract than if you had bought 100 shares outright. The drawback is you don’t actually own the shades, so you don’t get any benefits from dividends, splits, voting power, etc."
03/30/2021,stocks,look at the delta. the closer to 1 the more the option moves like stock because its deep in the money.
03/30/2021,stocks,"Check the delta, all things equal, a delta of 0.8 would mean that the option value increase $0.8 for every $1 increase in aapl share price. The deeper ITM, the closer the delta is to 1"
03/30/2021,stocks,"I’m not too versed in it, but IV probably doesn’t matter quite as much for a 3 year contract. As long as you buy at a time of low IVrank, it should come out in the wash over the longterm"
03/30/2021,stocks,"When you're deep ITM the large majority of the value of the option is intrinsic value. So any change to extrinsic value has a much smaller effect on the price compared to OTM calls which are 100% extrinsic. So yeah, IV crush, theta decay, etc is much less of a problem."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Yeah but OP is asking for maximize his profits if he is sure that the stocks will be higher than the strike for that date, buying deep OTM would maximize his profits, though the risk is higher. Despite the stocks goes down, it doesn't matter in the short term because he is long term, hopefully that stocks will eventually go higher than the strike before expiration date. It's more like Buy and Forgot for a long time."
03/30/2021,stocks,"If that happens, you win because the ITM call gained more value than the OTM call did (high delta).  Your best bet would be rolling the CC diagonally for a credit to prevent assignment.  If you can't do that, you buy shares to cover the call.  But if you can't do THAT, you exercise the LEAP (which is now even further ITM than it was before) and immediately sell those shares for a big profit.

[edit] - you don't want to exercise the LEAP as the default answer to this problem because it still has extrinsic value.  But if you don't have the cash or margin to buy the shares, this option does still work out heavily in your favor.  You could even sell the LEAP with huge returns, buy shares, and then fulfill the call, then start the process all over again."
03/30/2021,stocks,"You could, but your premiums will be tiny, and you want high Delta on the LEAP. You want a lot of intrinsic value to bugger swings in stock price and the Delta makes the LEAP gain value much more quickly than the CC if the share price approaches the strike of the CC."
03/30/2021,stocks,But premium must be hefty on a $70 strike. Who sells calls at $70!
03/30/2021,stocks,"Exercising the leap is not good advice, only people that fully understand how the numbers will work out after exercising should do this (ie. liquidity of the leap, amount of extrinsic value left, bid/ask spread).  You could easily turn the trade in to a net loser by exercising if you don't know what you're doing. 


Just sell the leap back to the open market along with the ITM short call."

03/30/2021,stocks,"Yes, that would be the last ditch option. It would be better to sell the LEAP and buy shares to cover."
03/30/2021,stocks,"True in dollar value, but not in terms of percentage.  OTM has only extrinsic value. A deep ITM call has a lot of intrinsic value, so yes, it costs more in premium, but the odds of it dropping to $0 are much lower than an OTM call.  When your LEAP is approaching expiration, you would expect the ITM LEAP to still have a lot of value unless the underlying really really tanks. If the OTM LEAP is still OTM, it's worth nothing."
2021-03-30 18:31:06,stocks,"Weekly options question This might be a stupid question but I wanted to be sure before I bought anything.

Problem is long term investors look at these companies and even ones we like we can’t buy at that valuation.  So it leads to the stocks of these companies having huge swings up and down on short term news.  

These stocks need to come down, which would be a good thing.  WHY?  Because then it will attract long term investors who actually want to buy in this company and won’t sell even if it goes up 100%.  You want long term investors in these companies and unfortunately you don’t have that now."

03/30/2021,stocks,I bought PLTR at $25.55 with the intention of holding for at least 2-5 years. We can chat again in a few years and discuss whether my buy in above $25 was a bad investment.
03/30/2021,stocks,Many growth stocks were lower then current prices on March 8th. I definitely took advantage of that. Are you sure this is a correction rather than a down period?
03/30/2021,stocks,"Partially agree. Not about NIO cuz is a long term Chinese Tesla. When chinese roars in some project, they go full rush. The rest ok."
03/30/2021,stocks,Who is realistically going to afford to buy these electric vehicles? I think the market is alot smaller than people think
03/30/2021,stocks,"The market is forward looking. The companies have high valuations because of their potential market growth. It’s a 10 horse race to becoming the next AMZN. When the dust clears, and new information reveals that one of the horses has broken his legs, the market moves all bets onto the remaining horses.

In other words P/E means nothing for growth stocks. P/E is a significant metric for blue chips that have reached market saturation. Growth stocks that are dropping in price are to be avoided unless you have a crystal clear knowledge of their future prospects."
03/30/2021,stocks,"If retail interest hasn’t changed and you are able to achieve the quick jump up in price we have saw over the last year .  Why is this not possible all the time.  Were larger investment groups also riding the same waves?   Yes bond yields and inflation, but what is slowing the stocks down that only retail investors seemed interested in?"
03/30/2021,stocks,"BHC has just about doubled in a year and has no present profits. Was the old Valeant that jacked epi pen prices and sells a lot of saline solution in little bottles. If they can’t make any money in these” price is no issue times” , how will they make money if things get truly competitive and we get away from manipulated prices from toilet paper to oil?"
03/30/2021,stocks,"Not saying there is no long term investors in them.  

For example I am sure long term investors bought PTLR at $15 a while back.  But to get a long term investor to pay $25 for it based on market cap and projected earnings won’t happen.  Risk/reward isn’t there at that price"
03/30/2021,stocks,I bought at $15.   So I look forward to chatting then
03/30/2021,stocks,Correction out of high valuation companies into divided companies perhaps
03/30/2021,stocks,The Chinese market is smaller than people think? Pretty sure it’s the opposite. Their population is 3x bigger than the US and economy is booming. Middle and upper classes are only growing. And the CCP is making EV transition a priority.
03/30/2021,stocks,Not trying to be condescending but have you gone to purchase a brand new vehicle recently? New gas powered cars are ridiculously expensive.
03/30/2021,stocks,"The market is growing every year. Ever since China started making the push around 2016, Europe has been trying to keep up, and now the US is trying to follow suit. If there is one industry i’d invest in rn, it’s electric vehicles. There won’t be many new ICE vehicles on the roads by 2030 and that’s just a fact. Once EVs become cheaper to produce than ICEs (which is around 2025, based on industry estimates), the momentum will shift dramatically. 

Source: my job is primarily comprised of market research on EVs"
03/30/2021,stocks,"Best answer I have seen so far, thanks for sharing"
03/30/2021,stocks,"Great point, however that was last year.  Now we have a rising interest rate environment, so valuations matter more now.     Perhaps the money was already made on those companies and now it’s too late.

Makes a interesting discussion for sure."
03/30/2021,stocks,PLTR has a ton of institutional longs on them. Not sure what you're getting at here.
03/30/2021,stocks,Cathie Woods just bought a gazillion shares at like 23 dollars soooooo
03/30/2021,stocks,"PLTR hasn’t been near $15 since it has been on my radar, and your entry being a better position doesn’t make mine a bad position. So, you could say, “I did better”, and I would still have gotten great returns."
03/30/2021,stocks,So you mean rotation.
03/30/2021,stocks,20k for a fucking Yaris in Europe. They have gone overboard the recent years
03/30/2021,stocks,"Yeah who bought at $15, but none of them would buy at $25 or whatever it’s trading at now as it’s too high.  Point is that valuations matter, especially in a rising interest rate environment"
03/30/2021,stocks,"And someone else sold them... 

Not saying good or bad either way.  Just letting you know"
03/30/2021,stocks,That’s my point. Tesla in my opinion is a luxur vehicle. You buy a new mid-luxury sedan you’re spending 45-60k easy in the US.
03/30/2021,stocks,"Not true. They've bought and sold several times. 

Funds work on a cost basis. They sell when performance hits a mark (if they bought at 15 they likely sold before 20). They have an obligation to do so in order to rebalance. There are laws against owning too much % of a company in a fund requiring taking profits when margins are hit.

Respectfully you sound like you're coming from a place without much practical finance education."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Huh? Kathie Wood has been loading up for her ARK funds recently, dumping millions into these. Are you just making stuff up?"
03/30/2021,stocks,"Mr. Taco;

Valuations matter.  Earnings also matter.


You sound like your talking from a place of ignorance sir"
03/30/2021,stocks,"Kathy wood yes, but she isn’t the only ETF out there"
2021-03-30 17:48:11,stocks,"SHW - Stock Split in coming days I wanted to see if anyone has been following Sherwin Williams.  Their stock is due to split on 4/1, making it more accessible for employees and new investors alike, to be able to afford the stock.  With consideration taken for the obvious covid dip, and following surge, it appears to me that they're positioned well.  And paying a small dividend.  I like this stock.  In 5 @$750.00.  Soon to be 15 at $250.  

A penny for your thoughts?"
03/30/2021,stocks,"It's a good long term hold type company.  Still has high debt from the Valspar acquisition.

Has increased dividend for 40 years.  It's been a we'll run business to be able to increase through several downturns"
03/30/2021,stocks,"Your math is wrong, is it 4:1 or 1:4? If it’s 1:4 you will have 20 shares not 15. 

Aside from that be careful, typically when a stock splits that much it has a rapid decline immediately."
03/30/2021,stocks,"It's a 3:1 split.  Unfortunately, I am now reading that those who owned the stock by 3/23 will have it paid out via a dividend, payable on the 31st.  DAMN.  I just purchased today.  Bag holder...."

03/30/2021,stocks,"Oh I think OP means 4/1 as April 1st, not 4:1 split :)"
03/30/2021,stocks,Ahhhh that makes more sense
2021-03-30 16:45:51,stocks,"Barrick’s Future bright admits stock dive Barrick Gold Corp. is crushing it in the world of mining and gold extraction.  But their stock has been on the skids...  with inflation looming and the Fed’s promise of not raising rates, it seems like Barrick and other gold stocks are the real sleepers in the market."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Will point out few industries destroyed more shareholder value in the last decade than gold miners (funnily enough gold streamers are one of the best performers). That said, I think a lot of balance sheets have been cleaned up and Barrick looks to be in a much better spot. Even looking past the fundamentals the only reason I  am considering this stock is they have Mark Bristow at the helm, he alone was with the $6.5B they paid for Rangold. The old Barrick would have jumped into the Freeport copper deal at any cost, you’re starting to see some cost discipline finally."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Meh I expect inflation to be underwhelming. Everyone knows the gold miners are the way to play inflation and they’re below where they were before covid (before M2 growth and low rates). 

They would have rallied and ran if inflation was a serious concern the markets telling you what the media isn’t."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Yea this my biggest play atm, I made a post a while back, Barrick, Kinross, and B2 are all on my watch list, in the coming week the prices may continue to drop but this is a huge opportunity."
03/30/2021,stocks,"I had a similar though may last year, and gold miners disappointed a lot. Maybe there are things I don’t understand but am staying far"
03/30/2021,stocks,"if inflation isn't a serious concern, then what's up with bond yields?"
03/30/2021,stocks,"B2 I'm watching also. I feel like gold is a heavily manipulated market however so its a huge target for the most powerful players. I worry about this.

Full disclosure, I'm an amateur at this. My expertise is in another field."
2021-03-30 16:22:06,stocks,"$AAMC - Am i just dense or is this really underpriced? I've been on the lookout for companies to invest in that aren't talked about much, I found this company that invests in REIT's (so investing in *it* is either like an increase of risk against the housing market or a hedge?) and they have had a bunch of awful years (earnings being around 0 EPS), now their last earnings for Q4 2020 had an EPS of more than the share price. I read in their last Q4 report they sold certain holdings off so that might have impacted earnings, nevertheless that still leaves a chunk as increase in value for the company to reinvest, the market does not seem to have reacted to this at all...

[https://i.imgur.com/RdB1tMY.png](https://i.imgur.com/RdB1tMY.png)

Right now people are worried about extremely low EPS ratio's for a lot of stocks, following this could mean that a stock like this might be undervalued but it also might just mean the ship is going under, anybody have any thoughts on this?"
03/30/2021,stocks,"[Here](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1555074/000155507421000032/aamc-20201231.htm#i5caf9c3697b6490396b0fc18de3a7cdc_106) we go. 

Take a look at the balance sheet where it outlays the earnings per share. The bulk of that positive number was EPS from ""Discontinued Operations."" They sold Front Yard (some bullshit company I'm too uninterested to look into). 

The operations that stayed were actually a loss of $9/share. The company actually sucks. It will lose money in the immediate future and the prospects for either its sustainability or growth are very slim going forward."
03/30/2021,stocks,An REIT that doesn't pay a dividend?
03/30/2021,stocks,It's odd that reports can vary so much on different platforms. That would make more sense then.
03/30/2021,stocks,"Yeah see that's what i'm not getting, it's not a REIT though, a company that invests in REITS, it's such a weird company the info is all over the place. It makes me wonder why it was ever priced at 5 times the current price..."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Yahoo is reporting the same number AAMC reported. It's just, the reason that number is so high is because of the extraordinary item of a one time sale that *will not* happen again in subsequent quarters. Which answers your question. It is not underpriced. You are dense."
03/30/2021,stocks,The listed EPS on TD is -$9.09. Sometimes they can be off but that's a big gap between Yahoo's quote and TD.

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Tuesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/30/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-tuesday-march-30.html)

*****

> # 1. Stock futures fall after Dow record as yields jump

> * U.S. stock futures dropped Tuesday as the 10-year Treasury yield hit a new 14-month high in early trading. The Nasdaq dropped Monday. The S&P 500 on Monday fell from the previous session’s record close. The Dow Jones Industrial Average bucked Monday’s downdraft, closing at another record despite weakness in bank stocks caught in the fallout of the Archegos Capital Management margin call chaos. With two days left in March, the Dow and S&P 500 were sitting on solid gains for the month. The Nasdaq was tracking for a monthly loss.

*****

> # 2. 10-year Treasury yield hits new 14-month high

> * The 10-year Treasury yield topped 1.77% early Tuesday, taking out another January 2020 high, as Covid vaccine rollouts and planned infrastructure spending boosted hopes of a broad U.S. economic recovery. However, the move also stoked inflation fears and put growth stocks, many of them tech names, under pressure because higher interest rates erode the value of future profits and squeeze market valuations.

*****

> # 3. How Goldman and Morgan Stanley avoided Archegos losses

> * In the Archegos meltdown, triggered by last week’s slide in shares of ViacomCBS and other stocks, Goldman Sachs avoided losses in the episode, CNBC’s Hugh Son reported. By the time Switzerland’s Credit Suisse and Japan’s Nomura said early Monday they unloaded positions on behalf of Archegos, Goldman Sachs and its Wall Street rival Morgan Stanley had already finished unloading their positions, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Archegos is a family office founded and by Bill Hwang, a former equity analyst at Julian Robertson’s Tiger Management.

*****

> # 4. CDC chief warns U.S. headed for ‘impending doom’ in Covid fight

> * The U.S. is facing “impending doom” as daily U.S. Covid cases begin to rebound once again, warned CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky. “We have so much to look forward to, so much promise and potential of where we are and so much reason for hope, but right now I’m scared,” she said in an emotional, candid moment during Monday morning’s press briefing. Even as vaccinations accelerate nationwide, coronavirus hospitalizations are also climbing and falling fatalities are starting to plateau. Walensky urged Americans to “just hold on a little longer.”

*****

> # 5. Biden tells states to reinstate coronavirus mask mandates

> * President Joe Biden followed his CDC director’s comments by urging governors and local leaders who dropped sweeping mask mandates to reinstate their orders. While indicating that some states should wait to reopen their economies, he also condemned “reckless behavior” likely to spur more infections. “We’re giving up hard-fought, hard-won gains,” Biden said in Monday afternoon’s press briefing. “As much as we’re doing America, it’s time to do even more.” He said a failure to take the virus seriously “is precisely what got us in this mess in the first place” and could lead to more infections and deaths.

03/30/2021,stocks,"One of the things that I'm trying to understand about NIO is if people are actually buying shares in the company or a proxy.

From my understanding, many Chinese companies aren't directly traded on international stock markets. This could in turn potentially open investors to risk.

Any chance someone could explain it to me, and how this might affect NIO shares.

Edit: What's with the downvotes?"
03/30/2021,stocks,[removed]
03/30/2021,stocks,That’s good news. But hypothetically what happens if NIO get delisted? How much are we expecting the stock to tank if it trades on the OTC markets?

03/30/2021,stocks,"This is getting heavily downvoted for your low effort post, but I have to say I agree with your sentiment. Battery swapping to save on charging time is an utterly moronic idea. 

It's not like the technology to fully charge your battery from 0% to 100% in under an hour is non-existent, it's called Level 3 charging.

Tesla experimented with battery swapping very early on, but ditched the idea for good reason and went with building out their own charging infrastructure instead."

03/30/2021,stocks,*cries in BB*
03/30/2021,stocks,"Tesla owner here who has driven across Canada twice in their shortest range model. Stopping for supercharging wasnt bad and offered a little break to watch netflix or whatever. But having the ability to get a fullied juiced battery in the same amount of time as gassing a car seems super appealing.

It might not be as popular in the west since people have chargers at home and unless theyre road tripping dont need an instant recharge. But in China with the dense population and power grid, people don't have chargers at home so being able to instantly replenish your cars charge while out for the day is really beneficial to them."
03/30/2021,stocks,">in under an hour

Who cares about charging a battery in an hour when I can put my car in this station that automatically replaces my battery in 3 minutes? Having to stop and charge your car for an hour is such a day-killer, you actually have to plan and make time for that. The battery swap takes as long as it takes to fill up a tank of gas and no one is moving plans around to make time for that. If I have to charge my Tesla it's ""hey sorry John I can't make it I'm tethered to a plug right now"""
03/30/2021,stocks,"Apart from the arguments people have given below, battery swapping has one other major advantage: new battery tech. If you buy a Tesla Model Y, and 6 months later they announce an upgraded battery as standard, you cannot get this battery without buying a brand new Tesla. And because if this, as your car gets older, so does the battery, and your resale value will decay by the day, even more so than ICE vehicles. With battery swap capabilities, the value of Nio vehicle is not tied to its battery. They release a new battery with superior range and charge times? It's very easy to rent that battery instead (Nio has a BaaS, or Battery as a Service scheme where you rent the battery as opposed to buying it. Makes the initial cost of ownership much cheaper and allows you to rent any new batteries when the time comes.)

So yeah, this goes much further than just the convenience of swapping for fuel. CEO Li Bin was involved with (founded I think) a used car selling company years ago and he understands all of this very well"
03/30/2021,stocks,"My particular concern is what effectively amounts to having a subscription fee for your vehicle if you can't access a conventional charge point. I would argue that paying for battery swaps is different from fuel costs. The former loses energy whether it is inactive or running, meaning you will *have* to recharge from time to time, while fuel just sits in a tank until used."
03/30/2021,stocks,Ton of NIO bag holders downvoting.  There is a reason this was $2 a year ago
03/30/2021,stocks,3 years??? Then why people so worried about delisting Chinese stocks?
03/30/2021,stocks,It would take 3 seconds to tank
03/30/2021,stocks,"In fairness, it won't take the stock to delist for it to tank. Just a NIO delisting rumour would be enough."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Everyone that complains about EVs are usually majorly concerned about charging times. Americans hate to wait, period. I like to have options, at home charging, lvl 3 charging, and battery swap options would be great."
03/30/2021,stocks,"That's exactly it. It would take less than 10 minutes if it's an empty station. If there are two customers ahead of you, it's easily a half hour wait. (watch the real life videos on YouTube). 

Then there are two queues. One for a fully charged battery (which has the longest wait) and the other for a partially charged battery. 

Battery swap looks great on paper, but IRL it has more downsides then an upside. Not to mention Nio has to spend extra capital on the expensive charging stations, and even more on additional batteries that would have gone into cars. All these lost opportunity cost and extra capital simply means Nio customers will pay more for very little advantages compared to a Tesla customer."
03/30/2021,stocks,Because people dumb.
03/30/2021,stocks,"See my reply above. Tesla vehicles lose resale value because it's tied to the battery. With battery swap capabilities this is not true for nio, and customers can rent new batteries as they become available. Not to mention that Nio can cut the initial cost of ownership by allowing customers to rent the battery as opposed to buy it (BaaS or Battery as a Service scheme). Even as an investor, I shared the same fear as you that swap stations prevented more problems than they solved... But they will still be offering charging too. And the more I researched it, the more I believed it's actually very clever"
2021-03-30 15:09:40,stocks,"General Mills and Cinnamon Toast Crunch As many of you have probably heard General Mills has some issues going around about their cereal. Cinnamon Toast Crunch in particular. A Twitter user posted a picture of shrimp tails in their box of cereal and it has gained some attention from others on Twitter and some new outlets. He also said he found a piece of string in the box and that the squares have something black cooked into them. 

Jensen Kerp (the Twitter user) has went and taken the squares to a lab to get them tested for rat or mouse droppings. At the time of writing this there has been no update about it. 

General Mills has been trying to help and said they are looking into it. They have also said “We can say with confidence that this did not occur at our facility”

What are the chances of there being more boxes like this and how do you think it will affect the company if these issues occurred at a General Mills facility?

I do not own any General Mills stock

The only reason anyone cares about this is because some yahoo managed to get his post upvoted to the top on reddit.  Real food contamination issues like listeria or E. coli outbreaks are hardly reported on, while people are using this unverified issue to try to dunk on their political enemies.  

Anyone with half a brain can see that this is probably due to a small animal getting into into a storage warehouse and stuffing some goodies inside a nearby box.  Gross, sure, but not exactly a matter of systemic negligence.  

It’s a non story unless relevant details come to light."

03/30/2021,stocks,"As far as I know liquidation has already happened. We can look to GME for example... Short squeeze to 400~ then mostly just retail going bananas for it after that still to this day. DISCA is a bit more under the radar until now; and if this really is a fire sale that it seems like to high conviction players this stock is gonna go bonkers, no shorts required. Can it dip, yes, can it go up, more then likely actually. Imagine watching a stock, as I have disca(made tons of money) go up 1% per day on average really.... And not exiting your trade as a hedge fund; wtf were those people thinking. Stupid. GME was much different , large swings and heard mentality. 

Tldr ; seems like resistance is around 40. And upward at 42 considering current events..I really have no doubt it will go up tho. Balls deep. 14 50$ 7/16 calls and 23 50$ 1/21 calls. I'm a peanut farmer, not a financial advisor of any kind."

03/30/2021,stocks,"The Venn diagram of VTI and FZROX is basically a circle. Carving up your contributions this much is a lot of work for minuscule gains if any.

03/30/2021,stocks,"I think adding some QQQM might be worthwhile. Over the long term, QQQM (which is basically QQQ with a lower expense ratio) has historically outperformed more broad market funds like VOO and VTI by more than double.  But, it is tech heavy and may be slightly more risky. I also like the ARK funds, but I'd be cautious about putting too much money in them."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Max out your roth with fzrox and fzilx. Thats good.

Extra money - nothing wrong with putting more money into VTI/VOO in your individual account. Broad market funds are ""safe"" and a great way to contribute past your retirement limit. You can allocate a bit into QQQM as well (not too much to minimize risk)."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Vanguard has many ETFs if you're looking for that type of exposure. Personally, I like VBK. It's been taking a hit recently, but it's done well for me over time. 

I picked up some VOO on sale last year when the market crashed, but I sold after it bounced back. It was a recovery play for me and not a long term holding strategy. However, many folks are quite comfortable with holding index funds long term if they're not actively trading.

At the end of the day, it just depends on what your investing strategy and goals are, how much time you're willing to look for opportunities, and what your risk tolerance is."

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

03/30/2021,stocks,"**Daily Stock Market Forecast**

**Bear case:**

The 10-year bond yield is at a year-to-date high.

So far, in March, the NASDAQ has gone down on every single day that the 10-year-yield reached a new high.

No exceptions.

**Bull case:**

Technical Analysis Tuesday time, bitches.

Try this: Open the NASDAQ chart, slap on some moving averages, and draw a box around the last 11 days of candlesticks. Or just [look at this picture](https://i.redd.it/palom11yh4q61.png) where I already did it for you.

You'll notice that, for the last 11 days:

* The NASDAQ has been perfectly bouncing between the lines of that box
* The bottom line of the box is the 100-day moving average
* We're running out of space in the box

The current trend is about to come to an end, and we haven't significantly broken through the 100-day moving average yet. We should be able to expect a breakout by the end of the week -- and, as long as we don't bust through that support line, I feel pretty confident it'll be an upward breakout.

We should hit that 100-day moving average fairly early in the trading day today, so we're likely to close higher than we open today.

**Forecast:**

Today is going to be a **red day** with a NASDAQ **high of 13,067** and a **low of ~~12,886~~ 12,925.**

It's usually sectors that do it, but yesterday what happened was enough to hold the S&P.

Break the rotations that seemingly happen every day and you'll get a market sell off, or could also get the market to rally."

I might get burned by talking about it so much but many were saying that the behavior last week was similar to February 23rd/24th, that was followed promptly by a -2.91% by SPX in two days, and in this case, it's been followed by a -0.4%."

Either way, unless you drop below the low 3900's on the S&P, this window of weakness that opened after OPEX will be closed after tomorrow, and it's not likely that ""muh tax hikes"" keeps it open. It wasn't kept open by concerns over the yield earlier in the month, it won't be kept open by this either, the structural flows for the S&P matter a lot more and it's likely that it will be shown once again soon."

It has dipped to 203 and even 201 this past week. Are the three dollars a big deal or does it not matter that much as I am only purchasing 5 shares? I feel as though I will miss out on the dip waiting for it to reach under 200 for just being stubborn. Is this patience or stubbornness?

03/30/2021,stocks,"With the 10Y this high and you haven't gotten out of your over-leveraged tech companies, you are basically asking for red in your portfolio. If you haven't gotten the message from the market yet, the market has rotated out of these high beta tech companies into value. You can see that whilst the S&P has been reaching new highs, the Nasdaq and tech have been left behind. This is especially seen in the FANG ETF's performance lagging behind the S&P 500. There have been huge upticks in XLP (consumer stocks) and USMV (USA Min Vol Factor ETF), low volatility, defensive indexes.

The tech bubbles have already burst and fund managers have been rotating into low beta stocks and ETFs, that is why on green index days you still experience sell-offs in your stocks because people are still selling to minimize loss. The value trend will continue for the next few years, especially with the current Fed policies. There are other assets out there that will provide better returns compared to the tech run-up over the last year. Now you guys actually have to do some research to find them as they are always under everyone's radar."

03/30/2021,stocks,They got 0 earnings. But thats expected because they're not selling anything.
03/30/2021,stocks,"Yeah, I cut my losses today. I literally bought at ATH on speculation news around Apple and then watched it tank for 2 months lol."
03/30/2021,stocks,Holy crap! No doubt.
03/30/2021,stocks,$PAVE plain and simple.
03/30/2021,stocks,"Clean energy ETFs have been down a big chunk from recent highs (ICLN, PBW, etc)."
03/30/2021,stocks,I'm expecting some push into renewable energy. God help us if there isn't...
03/30/2021,stocks,We had one a year ago
03/30/2021,stocks,"Possible? Sure. Likely? Maybe not. Last year was a black swan. Doesnt mean it can't happen again, but it was literally just the market overreacting to the virus. Idk if we saw a crash soon that it would recovery just as fast, but nobody knows. If they did, they'd be fucking loaded."
03/30/2021,stocks,"This is what a market looks like when it develops a floor, IMO."
03/30/2021,stocks,This might be a tease but I sense tech stocks are gonna be back up and running at full speed soon
03/30/2021,stocks,"wait, so clean and EV tech stocks go barely green while the Nasdaq and apple are still red FOR A WHOLE 1 HOUR and people are saying ""MUHHH RECOVERY NOW?""

you gotta be chitting me.

98% chance this just reverse back down by end of day to the red. even if it ends green, its one day. reversal back the next day.

If this is the start of the reversal I'll venmo you 1k"
03/30/2021,stocks,Seems like the question every morning...
03/30/2021,stocks,Aren’t we just traumatized at this point... lol
03/30/2021,stocks,I got my helmet on. Ready for liftoff or a deep dive.
03/30/2021,stocks,They've been predominantly flat since March 1. AAPL has been flat since February 22. They've got to break out of this rut soon.
03/30/2021,stocks,European here if you want the next 10 years to be flat trading like the last 2 months go right ahead.
03/30/2021,stocks,"VTI and SPY are like 90% the same (VTI has more mid and small caps). You're better off doing something like VTI and VXUS (international stocks). Or just put it in VT (which is basically VTI + VXUS, so you own the world)."
03/30/2021,stocks,"50% UPRO and 50% TQQQ, then give her half, tell her it was in VTI and SPY and take the spouse on a nice vacation with the rest."
03/30/2021,stocks,Sounds like you've painted yourself into a corner
03/30/2021,stocks,It's doing a 3:1 split in a few days. I anticipate (hope) this will be a good hold thru the next few quarters with some new buyers hopping in soon.
03/30/2021,stocks,Luckily powell decided to lay low for a while.
03/30/2021,stocks,Earnings report. Higher than average profits.
03/30/2021,stocks,There's an earnings call coming up in about 30 minutes. Probably related to that
03/30/2021,stocks,Wait...did they actually post a profit?
03/30/2021,stocks,"There's a daily one hour break from 4PM CT to 5PM CT. 

Should open in a couple of minutes."
03/30/2021,stocks,Recency bias?
03/30/2021,stocks,"I started swing trading and day trading exclusively last 3 days. Made some good $ and don’t have to stress the red days...I’m
Not holding till some of this kangaroo market is behind us."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Ends in a 'y', so, yeah."
03/30/2021,stocks,Vti or VT for more diversification
03/30/2021,stocks,SCHD
03/30/2021,stocks,Probably trying to protect you.
03/30/2021,stocks,thats how they get ya!
03/30/2021,stocks,What
03/30/2021,stocks,Might as well. The markets gonna start pumping again one day soon.
03/30/2021,stocks,Yes why not? Has anything fundamentally changes or are you just spooked about the red we’ve been seeing?
03/30/2021,stocks,I threw 2k at it cause why not. I got time and it will only go up
03/30/2021,stocks,Nope. None of that is gonna pop any time this decade.
03/30/2021,stocks,"If you hold the ARKX for 2 days or more, then it is fine if I remember correctly."
03/30/2021,stocks,"I believe you are correct. If you didn’t have enough settled cash before buying ARKX and sold it before the cash became settled, that would be a violation. But since you are holding it, there shouldn’t be anything to worry about. 

What I did was I applied for a margin account, but I strictly use cash and never dip into my margin. That way, you avoid good faith violation."
03/30/2021,stocks,"If you bought the ARKK with unsettled funds, you will get a 90-day GFV."
03/30/2021,stocks,shares or leaps
03/30/2021,stocks,Maybe? This market is so hard to analyze that I don’t think anyone knows go with your gut tho
03/30/2021,stocks,disney
03/30/2021,stocks,"i'd cheat and just buy vti

why put everything in 1 stock when you can just buy the market"
03/30/2021,stocks,"I was confused by the picks as well but, then you look into a company like John Deere's future plans and it starts to make a bit more sense.

I'm betting Space X will be the eventual bread and butter of ARKX, though."
03/30/2021,stocks,I have no interest in ARK but out of curiosity why is it bad for it to be popular?
03/30/2021,stocks,"Market is already saturated. We don't need more ETF's. Also, its got more amzn and JD.com by percentage in there than spce. Its basically another tech etf with a lot of military names mixed in."
03/30/2021,stocks,Yeah I need another -20% to add to my ARKQ and ARKF. Might as well add in ARKK and G and then with the X I’ll be at zero.
03/30/2021,stocks,I liquidated my ARK (ARKK an ARKG) positions.  Maybe I’ll eventually pick up ARKX.  For the time being it may not be a bad idea to have some cash on hand for heavily discounted stocks.
03/30/2021,stocks,Wondering the same.... I bought in at what I thought was a good price point at $83 🙄
03/30/2021,stocks,Fuck it I'll buy some. Whata the price expected to be at launch? (Pun)
03/30/2021,stocks,You sonofabitch I’m in
03/30/2021,stocks,Yes think long-term with Alibaba. Imagine people 7 years ago complaining that their Amazon stock wasn’t moving and asking if they should sell at $300.
03/30/2021,stocks,"It’s not hurting me. Not really helping me either,  but I think it’s gonna do some things. Someday."
03/30/2021,stocks,"It's had a few days where it held up on down days, but it is so hard to tell.  The general negativity for all things China doesn't help.  I'm holding mine for now, but it isn't a quick buck that is for sure."
03/30/2021,stocks,Would you like to borrow some of mine? I have several
03/30/2021,stocks,"One green day doesn't cancel out months of consecutive red days. With that said, I've been heavily buying dips and today just about broke even. Everyone saying don't buy the dip because its going lower is the best sign the bottom is reached."
03/30/2021,stocks,Amazon is planning to make their own chips as well to reduce dependency on Broadcom. I keep adding AMZN on every dip.
03/30/2021,stocks,"A part of me has been worried about my Amazon but from what I understand it is maybe the GOAT stock to own, they recently announced their NFL deal, Covid outlook is actually not as positive as we thought which means less retail shopping and continuing home deliveries"
03/30/2021,stocks,"watch inthemoney on YT. He has an options playlist

also, papertrade options before using your own money imo"
03/30/2021,stocks,"Highly recommend you start selling options first. Take whatever you have 100 shares of and sell a covered call. That will help you understand calls better.

You can also sell puts at prices you would be ok with buying 100 shares.

Buying options has greater potential for returns, but much higher risks. Most people lose a bunch of money when first starting out."
03/30/2021,stocks,DKNG for sure. 60 or below is good.
03/30/2021,stocks,"Be careful on the long term I found out the hard way it goes up fast, but it goes down way faster"
03/30/2021,stocks,You’re brave. The most they got out of me today was 5 shares. We will see how it goes. Been burned by ark before so I want to leave room to average down.
03/30/2021,stocks,+1.9%
03/30/2021,stocks,"+0.01%

Might buy a coffee later."
03/30/2021,stocks,1.5
03/30/2021,stocks,\+0.78% today. -3.69% in total for the month.
03/30/2021,stocks,+0.48% I will take it
03/30/2021,stocks,Up .05 before index adjustment. Then I’ll be down.
03/30/2021,stocks,Up +1.7% on stocks and +1.5% on crypto.
03/30/2021,stocks,Up 2.6% today but still down 5.3% for the month.
03/30/2021,stocks,I ended up down $0.04. Just wouldn't let me print a green day lol
03/30/2021,stocks,But if I keep blowing up rockets I don’t have enough fuel (money) to keep trying to launch them. They have more than enough fuel to keep trying.
03/30/2021,stocks,Two large sons or two fat as fuck sons?
03/30/2021,stocks,"Weird, Robinhood limiting what you can buy?  

/s"
03/30/2021,stocks,"Debt is still historically cheap this year, so I'm afraid those companies won't have their major advantage back until \~2023. There was so much FUD lately even though federal interest rates aren't changing and the economy is getting better, it's really wild how misinformed people are. How many times does Powell need to say his plan until people figure it out?"
03/30/2021,stocks,"It’s way overvalued still, period. 15 is a fair overvalue, 12 is a fair value.  8-9 is a steal.   

the reason for the 30-40 price was the potential future disruption this company has. If they nail it it’s HUGE. 

The thing is, pltr is not in a hurry. They are “get it right” before profits.  So investors don’t a clear horizon of when they will start pwning. Therefore. Stock down."
03/30/2021,stocks,Market cap is shrinking because the share price is dropping. The share price is dropping because a lot of share prices are dropping.
03/30/2021,stocks,"Probably because nobody has a reason to buy it right now. No news means there's no reason to buy, which means anyone looking to sell their shares will have to sell closer to the bid price to get a sale."
03/30/2021,stocks,I’ll wait for LMND to drop a little bit more. NET I think is a solid buy right now.
03/30/2021,stocks,"I like NET. Massive top line growth, 50% CAGR since 2016... I do think it’s priced in though. I’m keeping my eye on them to see if they drop more. As for LMND I personally still think it’s very over priced"
03/30/2021,stocks,"I mean LMND is less than half of it's high. I still strongly believe in it's future, especially as millenials and the generations after get older and the ease of things like signing up for insurance become more and more important. In 10 years it could be worth 10X what it is now or more. I mean, who knows, it may go away too but I still think it's a great long term investment and even if it's bottom is a little lower in 5-10 years no one will care."
03/30/2021,stocks,"I’m looking at NOV and waiting for FNKO to drop a bit more, also maybe something in financials like CS"
03/30/2021,stocks,"I keep enough to cover my expenses in the bank account. 

Everything else goes into the market"
03/30/2021,stocks,"What you invest in depends on your situation—age and time ‘til you’ll need the money. If you want to retire in the next five years, you’d be much safer with your choices. If you have decades to ride out volatility, the market trends up over time so you can go for more growth."
03/30/2021,stocks,"I don't think you need to worry about that.  


From what I understand, when you sell a position, you don't have the money right away. Some brokers will allow you to ""use that money"" within that same account, but you can't actually withdraw/transfer it for at least 2 business days."
03/30/2021,stocks,Rycey is a meme at this point. Everyone buying it doesnt understand the dilution where then company would need to increase its cap by trillions to hit their $15 price lol
03/30/2021,stocks,Dead beat company
03/30/2021,stocks,Bro it had green days for the entirety of last month?
03/30/2021,stocks,"Lol. I thought about it for a minute, because it's Rolls Royce but couldn't pull the trigger."
03/30/2021,stocks,Worth buying rn then?
03/30/2021,stocks,A lot can happen in 4 minutes
03/30/2021,stocks,if you expect a dip then why wouldn't your etfs dip too
03/30/2021,stocks,i wouldn't bother and just keep it as cash so its readily available if you know you will be buying dips over the next month or so
03/30/2021,stocks,"Too late, bull run starts tomorrow"
03/30/2021,stocks,"ICLN. 

j/k already tried that in February and down 30%."
03/30/2021,stocks,"It doesnt bug me too much just cause AAPL is one of the true ""retirement stocks"" for me. Other positions of mine I get stressed by the day to day movement but I dont see myself selling AAPL for decades so its whatever. Selfishly, it has allowed me to keep loading up lol"
03/30/2021,stocks,Why would you expect a 2 trillion dollar company to make big moves?  There are so many more stocks you could trade for 4 week swings why pick a mega cap lifelong hold type stock and then be frustrated that it hasn't exploded?
03/30/2021,stocks,I’m waiting til Th. We will either drop more by then or find support.
03/30/2021,stocks,You need a better plan than reacting.
03/30/2021,stocks,Just day trade it
03/30/2021,stocks,"If I were day trading, I wouldn't mind this see saw. I'd just get in and out in and out..."
03/30/2021,stocks,So frustrating. They just won’t let this thing go. Think I’m moving out AAPL and into VTI. I just don’t see it beating the index this year. Next year will reevaluate
03/30/2021,stocks,Sell CCs. The premiums are decent right now. I've moved my average down by a point or more every week for the past few weeks.
03/30/2021,stocks,"Is this from Buffet selling some of his stake? The price is still so high but it’s Apple, people will always buy their products and they’ll keep expanding to wearables, AR/VR.."
03/30/2021,stocks,Isn't this a good time to buy APHA considering in a few weeks shareholders will approve their merger?
03/30/2021,stocks,Thoughts on UUUU? They haven't been selling uranium as they price had been to low for them. Wondering if its time to get into UUUU
03/30/2021,stocks,Lol'd at the part about rain
03/30/2021,stocks,Lol I wanna know the same thing but for ICLN.
03/30/2021,stocks,"Ark is in a bear market IMHO. 

That doesn't mean it can't have another big bounce, but it's a trade, not own right now."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Yup, buying solid tech companies right now could seriously set you up for life. I wouldn't buy just anything but if you're buying great companies at 2/3, a half or even less of their high you will look very smart in a year. And look like a genius in 10 years...."
03/30/2021,stocks,I will cry.
03/30/2021,stocks,You mean like if everyone got so amped up on APPL that they priced in every future growth catalyst already?
03/30/2021,stocks,It better not lol
03/30/2021,stocks,Magical red stick that can read the future
03/30/2021,stocks,"Apple stayed somewhat flat for almost a full year after 2014 split. It split at 100 and got to 300 by feb 2020. Then back down to 212 after pandemic. Then 212 to 535 from April to September 1 2020. So yes, it takes awhile. It’s also the main holding of almost every single mutual fund and 401k offering. So it won’t go too low but I think you’re right on this one."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Candles are filling in the wrong way is one sign.    Another sign of price manipulation is coiling at resistance and volume trends.   Take a look at bitcoin for the past two months to see what I mean.

Another type of rigging is collusion, options plays, stealing money from retail investors, pumps and dumps.  As in 1929, this is rampant today, and the SEC seems toothless - but maybe they don't want to spook us with hedge fund bankruptcies.

Personally I would welcome some high profile arrests to bring confidence to investors."
03/30/2021,stocks,It's like your spouse spontaneously saying that they didn't cheat on you at work today lol
03/30/2021,stocks,"> tall tail signs?

is that like signs that something is bullshit?"
03/30/2021,stocks,Time in the market means decades not months.
03/30/2021,stocks,"Yeah that quote only applies to long term, talking several years. In short term, I actually think it's false and simply a quote people throw around to justify to themselves, they made the right decision to buy early, even when it's at their high peaks, after some absurd rally of over 300-700% within a year. Proof is anyone that bought February 2020 or 2021, ask them if they made the right decision, the 6 months after that."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Once again, I completely agree with you. These dips are buying opportunities, as the risk is to the upside once we (mercifully) enter Q2 and earnings season. Accordingly, I nibbled a little bit at AMD already, and am ready for a huge nosedive if we do decide to test SPY 3900. But we bounced so hard off of 3850 last week, and have grinded so well along 3950 ever since, that I'm starting to wonder whether we do see another nosedive."
03/30/2021,stocks,Agree completely. A few weeks ago we would have seen the nasdaq crash on these bond yields.
03/30/2021,stocks,how's that feeling going so far?
03/30/2021,stocks,Start low end high type feeling?
03/30/2021,stocks,GME will be just as responsible for people buying new lambos or being forced to live off food stamps as COVID
03/30/2021,stocks,"Typically people invest in gold when the price of the dollar is decreasing, or the stock market is dipping. But crypto has sort of taken over that role"
03/30/2021,stocks,"Only boomers believe in buying gold to fight inflation these days so there isnt much demand, along with crypto eating into the niche."
03/30/2021,stocks,Gold has been a conservative scam for decades. Imagine investing in something they sell on Rush Limbaugh commercials. You will never ever buy anything with gold again. At least get into crypto.
03/30/2021,stocks,"Perhaps the reaction here has been a big mistake but the GLD ETF sucked during the last 4 year term for a Democrat. Lost over 20%.

Gonna have to go elsewhere for inflationary protection."
03/30/2021,stocks,"I think you've nailed it once again. We're going to see a bit more rebalancing in the final days of March, dragging down the QQQ slightly. But I wonder whether we're done with the large-scale dump offs as we form a floor here."
03/30/2021,stocks,I’ve been looking at this
03/30/2021,stocks,Crypto is getting a tax hike or a more general one?
03/30/2021,stocks,ABBV always
03/30/2021,stocks,you shouldnt be buying stuff when its green
03/30/2021,stocks,I’d go with AAPL.
03/30/2021,stocks,SQ or AAPL would be what I’d buy.
03/30/2021,stocks,APPL you need some safer picks to balance out ARK
03/30/2021,stocks,Why not a lc growth etf like voog or schg? You get all those and less risk to offset your ark positions.
03/30/2021,stocks,"DK and Barstool seem to be the apps people actually use, at least around here"
03/30/2021,stocks,"hope you haven’t bought it yet because some brief research shows this company had net income of -122 million last year with revenues of only 230 million, lenders won’t touch this company, chief executives are dumping shares like the company’s burning down, and it seems that they’re issuing massive amounts of stock as a last ditch effort to bring some cash in. all around, this is a horrible investment. that said, technicals look good for a short term swing play but apart from that, i would steer clear."
03/30/2021,stocks,I wish I could double upvote
03/30/2021,stocks,"That's good enough for me, YOLO on Ebang"
03/30/2021,stocks,Trap
03/30/2021,stocks,Username checks out
03/30/2021,stocks,Look at charts. After splits it goes sideways then goes up over a few years. Good hold. I own a lot of apple and can chill with it a few years.
03/30/2021,stocks,Did you short AAPL or something?
03/30/2021,stocks,Great company been working for them for 10 years using the stock purchase program made me a very wealthy man and I started at 25$ an hour. Getting closer and closer to 1 mil net worth everyday.
03/30/2021,stocks,"At this point, it may unironically be a good idea to hold a few GME shares as a hedge against the market lol"
03/30/2021,stocks,"DOW at an ATH, SPY near ATH, NASDAQ still way up and youre comparing it to 08 and the COVID crash? Man you're gonna get fucking smoked if we have a real market-wide crash and not just speculative/growth/tech getting knocked down a few pegs after an insanely high run."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Statistically speaking buying AAPL 15% off it’s ATH yields 39% returns within a year. 

idk why you would ever buy AAPL low and then sell it even lower just to lose money"
03/30/2021,stocks,Just wait
03/30/2021,stocks,Depends on what you need them for. New gamer setup? Chemotherapy?
03/30/2021,stocks,Why did you invest that money if you needed it in a year? What is your average? If you are up I would get it out and sell. Market could be down 50% tomorrow or up 50%. But with that short of a timeline that money should have never been in the market.
03/30/2021,stocks,Have they decided when this will happen yet? And is the new number still 28%?
03/30/2021,stocks,Priced in already IMO
03/30/2021,stocks,Looking forward to it. They pay nothing in taxes and it’s time they start.
03/30/2021,stocks,"Hahahaha, so true. Apple showing weakness again i don’t like it. If the FAANG don’t step up i don’t believe in a breakout."
03/30/2021,stocks,The drop here is likely money moving from equities into bonds (seems like ~1.75% yield is where funds start selling equities and buying bonds). This is why the market is not exactly rallying
03/30/2021,stocks,3 employees? Sounds like a crock of shit.
03/30/2021,stocks,"How so? It looks like we're already rotating back to tech and growth, which makes sense."
03/30/2021,stocks,Don't be so optimistic
03/30/2021,stocks,Same I bought call option and it took a shit this morning
03/30/2021,stocks,"Also, the highest I paid per share was 201, and I only bought 1 share."
03/30/2021,stocks,There are etf comparison and overlap tools out there
03/30/2021,stocks,Look at the holdings
03/30/2021,stocks,How was that a lie? Many tech stocks dropped like 20% since Feb.
03/30/2021,stocks,Same
03/30/2021,stocks,Chwy is soaring in the after hours and they did something so impressive it warrants it.
03/30/2021,stocks,I'm green 😋
03/30/2021,stocks,It's a green day
03/30/2021,stocks,I'm not sure if that's the case today. The huge drops after the quick rises have been way bigger over the past week. Seems to be holding green today.
03/30/2021,stocks,r/agedlikemilk
03/30/2021,stocks,That was a bad decision.
03/30/2021,stocks,Anything but an ARK fund unless you enjoy burning money
03/30/2021,stocks,"A recession is 2 quarters of negative GDP growth. So unless we see negative growth, we can’t call it a recession."

03/30/2021,stocks,"To date, the NASDAQ has dropped 8%, the S&P 500 has dropped 0.4%, and the Dow-Jones is up 2.5%.

So -- not yet."
03/30/2021,stocks,XLI industrial ETF has been rock solid through all of this.
03/30/2021,stocks,Verizon?
03/30/2021,stocks,I pivoted some of my positions into defensive stocks. REITs a good idea too if you are looking for something more long term
03/30/2021,stocks,LMT
03/30/2021,stocks,"No, this remains a normal, healthy corrective period, something that happens several times per year. A recession would be 2 or 3 times deeper than this, and would last far longer than just a month and a half. This is a walk in the park compared with a recession."
03/30/2021,stocks,No. The S and P is down a whopping 0.8% from it's all time high.
03/30/2021,stocks,We're down less than 1% from SPY ath's and you're asking if we're in a recession? Jesus Christ..

03/30/2021,stocks,Same
03/30/2021,stocks,Out of those 2 I'd stick with G

03/30/2021,stocks,Neither
03/30/2021,stocks,"but they're just marketing, I think it's a scam (will probably go up tho)"
03/30/2021,stocks,I wonder if this ever works
03/30/2021,stocks,I can almost guarantee that you would've lost more if you had been day trading
03/30/2021,stocks,Diversify your holdings instead of focusing on just large companies.
03/30/2021,stocks,Dude. Sell limit orders.
03/30/2021,stocks,"Why did it drop?? You caused the drop yourself by using the market sell order.

A market sell order is essentially you yelling to the tentative buyers ""I'll take whatever price for this, I don't care"""

03/30/2021,stocks,"As stated previously, since you’ve repeatedly posted this for some reason, that news is two weeks old. 


Did you buy puts or something? It feels like you have some personal reasons for trying to mislead people."
03/30/2021,stocks,"$14 huh?  Sounds oddly specific, almost as if you potentially have something to gain by it dropping to that point."
03/30/2021,stocks,Ok boomer

03/30/2021,stocks,Your post history is pathetic if you aren't a bot. Get a life man
03/30/2021,stocks,"Q1 2021 is going to look very favorable to Q1 2020 since March was a very negative month for most companies last year. Many tech companies are down 30-45% over the past 6 weeks, plenty of which have incredible growth and confirmed > +30% YoY guidance for Q1. 

Will be interesting for sure. I personally believe we'll go sideways for a while, and the oversold companies will correct to a fair value."
03/30/2021,stocks,Perion is my personal favourite right now.
03/30/2021,stocks,Shhhhh icln likes green
03/30/2021,stocks,"Was glad to have broken even on GME... My stepson was all like HAY GUYS! LETS BUY GME... so I bought 1 share for him and 4 for me @ 220. Saw that shit dip down and told him, ""If this ever gets back to 220 Im out."" I set a limit sell on it and forgot about it. Month and a half later, after watching the bloodshed, I was finally (and thankfully) out of that fiasco. 

No more meme stocks for me. Im gonna stick with my own DD and keep at it that way."
03/30/2021,stocks,During the first meme boom my GME and BB was up 20k... and like a fool I didn't realize any of those gains.
03/30/2021,stocks,Is it not on Robinhood 🤦‍♂️
03/30/2021,stocks,It’s almost like they’re punishing everything in them. I put a little into BFLY just because I was blown away by their product. Should have just got a new roof instead.
03/30/2021,stocks,"Agreed. This behavior indicates a big move, one way or another. I tend to think that move will be up, once we get beyond Q1. But there's still time enough in March for one more nosedive. Either way, I'm prepared."
03/30/2021,stocks,"This range bind is frustrating. C'mon, let's go one way or the other... Beep beep beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep..."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Careful recommending stuff to me, I just mentioned how stocks I buy go tits up after."
03/30/2021,stocks,They weren’t gaining market share on intel anymore from the latest reports. For the amd valuation to be legit they need to keep eating intel’s market share. If that stops amd is suddenly looking really pricey.
03/30/2021,stocks,"Agreed.  If they were wise instead of greedy, they'll come out of this smelling like roses."
03/30/2021,stocks,This right here. Easiest money 💰

03/30/2021,stocks,A press conference today 'climate day' about a multi trillion infrastructure package that's supposed to be dropped tomorrow indicated there would be a lot of money spent on overhauling the US energy grid and energy production
03/30/2021,stocks,I am. But I didn't sell for losses.
03/30/2021,stocks,"What time is that at, or has it been announced already? Do you think it'll send us down further than 2%?"
03/30/2021,stocks,"Hey happy to help. 

**First thing's first - make sure you contribute before May 17th**! I know you said you're contributing in April, but I urge you to make sure you don't put it off, as the May 17th deadline is final for 2020 contributions. Usually the annual deadline falls on April 15th, but the IRS has extended it this year in an effort to provide relief. 

Additionally, you can contribute a maximum of $6,000 to a Roth IRA every year, so while I like your plan to add money out of each paycheck, **I recommend you add as much money as you possibly can right now!** Even if you don't have $6k right now or even close to it, **contribute as much money as you can budget for the 2020 tax year**, and you'll be very happy you did. Then for the rest of the year you can start contributing out of each paycheck for the 2021 tax year!

As for the portfolio breakdown:

* Originally (last year when I started the Roth IRA) my **target** allocation was as follows:
   * 40% Total Market (VTI)
   * 35% Growth (VUG)
   * 25% Tech (VGT)
* In the past couple of months, I decided to add the **crypto** funds to my retirement account, so I amended the **target allocation** percentages to the following:
   * **Four-way even split (25%) between Total Market, Growth, Tech, and Crypto**
   * To breakdown the cryptos, the target split between the two is **75% Bitcoin, 25% Ethereum (20% and 5% of the total portfolio, respectively).**
* Since the values are constantly changing, and  because I had some cash in the account waiting to purchase, the **ACTUAL** percentage break down is currently:
   * 24% Total Market (VTI)
   * 22% Tech (VGT)
   * 20% Cash
   * 19% Growth (VUG)
   * 12% Bitcoin (GBTC)
   * 3% Ethereum (ETHE)

Let me know if you have any other questions."
03/30/2021,stocks,I mean I can afford $100 stocks I even jumped on GME when it was $260 a pop!
03/30/2021,stocks,Why is this a bullish signal?
03/30/2021,stocks,Or is it a bulltrap?
03/30/2021,stocks,Nice
03/30/2021,stocks,"Yeah I’m holding pltr for 3 years minimum, hopefully more. People looking for massive short terms gains are playing a losing game. It’s just one of those stocks you put money into every chance you get, and sit on it."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Not sure, didn't read the notes yet. Might just be parsing algo's responding to the word search and finding loss per share."
03/30/2021,stocks,Thanks this seems perfect
03/30/2021,stocks,It's like PTSD lol
03/30/2021,stocks,Interesting
03/30/2021,stocks,"Personal worst score:

Thanks, J. Powell."
03/30/2021,stocks,Think it will keep rising tomorrow or tank?
03/30/2021,stocks,Ah ok thanks!
03/30/2021,stocks,I like that one. Recency bias. Learn something new everyday!
03/30/2021,stocks,What if the crash happens at 11 am and you bought at 10:59
03/30/2021,stocks,what stocks have you been swing trading?
03/30/2021,stocks,Yeah I guess I am just spooked that I won’t be breaking even until November if I’m lucky or at all. Or if I should dump the call and keep the shares.
03/30/2021,stocks,It has GOOG AMZN and NVDA so those are just gonna trade flat for 10 years?
03/30/2021,stocks,no only if they sell the ARKX before the funds settle (2 days)
03/30/2021,stocks,"No, I used money thats been sitting there forever waiting for this coinbase IPO. It was well settled, but thanks"
03/30/2021,stocks,Shares. 100% of my portfolio is only 30 shares so it’s not like I’ve thrown a ton of money at it or anything
03/30/2021,stocks,I agree with this. A blue chip with strong growth potential through Disney+. I’ve read the bear cases and they feel shortsighted or missing the forest for the trees.
03/30/2021,stocks,"Lol, buying in at ATH before a correction is on you though."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Except they are starting to unionize, wait till the whole workforce is in a union, say goodbye to profits and production"
03/30/2021,stocks,"Same, in for 5. Waiting to see as time goes on if it deserves to be DCA’d into a significant position. 

I sort of like the holdings though, I may be alone on that lol."
03/30/2021,stocks,Same. I haven’t bought in and probably won’t but I wouldn’t grab more than 5.
03/30/2021,stocks,What is index adjustment?
03/30/2021,stocks,Asking the real questions here
03/30/2021,stocks,NET to me is a 5 year play type stock. It's too big to fuck up. This is just a dip
03/30/2021,stocks,Same.  Of the money I allocate to my trading account each month I keep half as cash for buying opportunities.  Bank account is just food and shelter money for the month though.
03/30/2021,stocks,"You think I won't be able to transfer from my brokerage account into my IRA on the same day? I know they won't let me withdrawal, but I'm wondering since they're both with Fidelity if they'll let me do that. I think I might just try and call to ask"
03/30/2021,stocks,Last week was heavy man
03/30/2021,stocks,Check out PT. I think this could run to $10 this week but is PT in $15 and higher. I put money in to stop the bleeding a bit with my other positions.
03/30/2021,stocks,That’s what I try to tell my wife
03/30/2021,stocks,Yep! This is my view as well. I just add small pieces on the dips.
03/30/2021,stocks,"Ya, I've been watching the downward trend of Nasdaq Highs. I'll buy in when it finally breaks that. Until then, I'm watching from afar."
03/30/2021,stocks,I very well might.
03/30/2021,stocks,Completely 100% agree
03/30/2021,stocks,If you don’t mind me asking which ones are you buying?
03/30/2021,stocks,What do you mean by candles filling in the wrong way?
03/30/2021,stocks,"Right, like when Senators sold all their stock before the pandemic hit, that was a sign.."
03/30/2021,stocks,"lol decades. Everything should go up in 10 years time, otherwise no will invest"
03/30/2021,stocks,"> decades

Hahaha

Imagine your trading strategy being to wait until you're an old man breathing through a tube before making any money"
03/30/2021,stocks,"I bought at feb high, don’t give a fuck my horizon is 10 years on my purchases. The decision was right."
03/30/2021,stocks,Still feel good I think it will get better
03/30/2021,stocks,I'm feeling it. I'm betting on green by 2
03/30/2021,stocks,Yeah for every success story there's like 10 people who FOMO'd into the hype and are waiting for it to spike into the 400's again.
03/30/2021,stocks,"Basically this. People buy gold, typically too late, and then their money gets locked up until they can get it back in the next recession.

Gold is up there with male vitality supplements as a means of grifting old men. They convince them that Venezuela-style hyperinflation is right around the corner any time a Democrat gets elected."
03/30/2021,stocks,"If that's the case, then it's been a ""scam"" for much longer than decades. More like millennia. People have collectively agreed on the value of gold pretty much as long as there have been people.

And Rush Limbaugh also sold MyPillow. Does that mean the concept of sleep is a scam?"
03/30/2021,stocks,imagine literally investing in a string of 1's and 0's.
03/30/2021,stocks,It's definitely too early to say. QQQ couldn't even pull itself back into the green. It's fallen back down again and the highs have been getting progressively lower since February. I think waiting a while to let the dust settle is the best thing to do right now
03/30/2021,stocks,"Yeah, as the other guy said, this bouncing around in range seems ripe for a move, and I tend to think it will be down before up. I don’t think the weakness is over, although some people who I follow are talking about a big hike up coming in April. I’m kind of conflicted, and have lots of cash. Think the best thing to do is to watch and wait, even if we go back to ATH there is a lot of time to buy in and potential upside over the next month."
03/30/2021,stocks,Corps are getting a tax hike so a rotation into crypto. Also the visa news
03/30/2021,stocks,They’re referring to the Biden admin tax hike announcement later today. It isn’t related to crypto
03/30/2021,stocks,"While it’s true you shouldn’t buy on a Green Day, maybe he’s just looking to see how other people diversify, and what is being good to them."
03/30/2021,stocks,It has been trading sideways for the least few days. I wouldn't call it a trap.
03/30/2021,stocks,What do you mean trap?
03/30/2021,stocks,Yea but you had to work at apple for 10 years
03/30/2021,stocks,This is just noise along the way.
03/30/2021,stocks,"Lol this is why I never sold all my GME shares even after the crash last January, I sold enough to cover my costs, so rest inside is houses money, but kept only a couple shares, just in case as fomo insurance, if it really does rally again, it did."
03/30/2021,stocks,The Russell 2000 has been getting shit on
03/30/2021,stocks,Same reason anyone pulls out: house.
03/30/2021,stocks,"Thanks man, I needed to hear this. Taking my gains and paying off student debt"
03/30/2021,stocks,You're looking forward to losing money?
03/30/2021,stocks,So you don’t care about your portfolio?
03/30/2021,stocks,Who cares about that? I’m here to make money.
03/30/2021,stocks,Did you sell for a loss earlier in the year? That loss gets added to your cost basis in a wash sale. Maybe your broker is just really slow?
03/30/2021,stocks,[deleted]
03/30/2021,stocks,OP just finished rotating into ATH value plays.
03/30/2021,stocks,"Lol. Well it didn’t all come back. 

230- 2.3%
250- 1.6%
300-1.9%

That was a lot of movement in 30 minutes."
03/30/2021,stocks,I don't know how you can look at the holdings in ARKK and tell me you don't want a little piece of those for the next five years.  That's just me though.
03/30/2021,stocks,That's it? Holy shit.
03/30/2021,stocks,"If my stocks do this bad with the SPY down only 1% I imagine Apple and Tesla would straight up go bankrupt with a 5% drop.

It’s a fucking joke people."
03/30/2021,stocks,Thanks again crazy Joe.
03/30/2021,stocks,"Wow, that's certainly a long time away. I'm sure it's part of the reason why the drops continuing, but I guess fear selling is the main reason stocks are going down right now"
03/30/2021,stocks,"It's a company which IPOed less than two months ago, how it's a scam? 
It is not a reverse merger and they didn't get listed through a SPAC."
03/30/2021,stocks,I agree I don’t think this guy could stomach day trading
03/30/2021,stocks,"Are you kidding me dude buy option for stock that dipped hard like lets say PLUG at morning dip around 945 sell at peak around 11 

You could have easily done this with for the past 3 months with calls and puts meanwhile holding monthlys you get wrecked because of IV crush"
03/30/2021,stocks,I honestly don't know how to do that.
03/30/2021,stocks,Head wind is still there. Compressed Hydrogen is not really hi tech!! Old news to pump the stock
03/30/2021,stocks,"Yes indeed, bearish"
03/30/2021,stocks,You're a NIO holder - makes sense.
03/30/2021,stocks,"Oh yeah,  definitely interesting.   

I was referring to the financials Q1 vs Q1 looking bad for a lot of companies, but you're right about everything that got a boost from the lock downs will look really good in that comparison.  The companies that have uneven quarters like retail,  or agriculture where you don't want to compare a Q4 to a Q1, will look awful.   I just keep trying to make predictions based on 2019 numbers knowing that they'll be wrong,  but it's the best i know how to do."
03/30/2021,stocks,Thanks!
03/30/2021,stocks,"Yeah for sure.. I set $25 as my sell point for AMC (it was as high as $20), and that was the day Robinhood shut it all down and prevented that price point being hit. Instead of $35k gains I had to ""settle"" for $10k. At least I exited at some point so I could burn it away on options."
03/30/2021,stocks,Yeah roofs are important. I mean if it's a company you believe in it could be a good long term hold but it def sucks
03/30/2021,stocks,I don’t even know what happened to BFLY today after earnings. This was always a future play so why would people sell after a 60%+ YOY increase
03/30/2021,stocks,Maybe he’s got puts?
03/30/2021,stocks,That'll do it!
03/30/2021,stocks,"I sold some stocks for small losses in Feb and they are still trending down, so I feel satisfied with that decision. But in truth it's only a matter of time before you break even"
03/30/2021,stocks,"tbh, I suspect it won't be as bad as the market has already priced in and will cause a temporary spike in stocks. Not sure what time the official announcement is, I saw a video on the leaked tax plan on 'Meet Kevin' (youtube) and it didn't seem so bad."
03/30/2021,stocks,Wow thanks for the heads up and detailed answer! Definitely going to contribute as much as possible before May 17th. Quick question. Why not just put the money in Crypto directly and hold the currency instead of add it as a position in the Roth?
03/30/2021,stocks,You're a brave man for that one.  That is the stock everyone kicked themselves for not buying at $5.  I was in at like $113?  I don't know I tried to get in on the second wave but by the second day I was losing money.  Definitive buy and hold if I jump in again
03/30/2021,stocks,Bulls are heating up atm.

03/30/2021,stocks,I don’t fuck around with earnings plays. Could always be a bull trap.
03/30/2021,stocks,Then he goes down with the ship like everyone else.
03/30/2021,stocks,Honestly I try to sell by 10 am everyday before that dip
03/30/2021,stocks,My last two were SLGG and Wisekey. I got lucky with SLGG cuz it tanked right after I sold. Wisekey is a NFT stock so it’s pretty volatile. It’s been running between 15-19. I don’t think I’m day trading today though...just working the regular job
03/30/2021,stocks,EXPI also. It’s been running between 39-46ish
03/30/2021,stocks,How long Have you been holding for?
03/30/2021,stocks,Possibly.
03/30/2021,stocks,"Yes, he meant what you said would of triggered if my funds for the ARKK weren’t settled"
03/30/2021,stocks,I am correct
03/30/2021,stocks,Why are you 100% invested in a company that can’t make a profit?
03/30/2021,stocks,"AMD was one of my first stocks from back in January, think first price was around 88 and second and third were in the 82 range. So if you are doing better than that, well done :)"
03/30/2021,stocks,Dad is that you?
03/30/2021,stocks,they really aren't close to a union at all
03/30/2021,stocks,“Too big to fuck up”. Is that your analysis and reason for investing in them??
03/30/2021,stocks,"I've never tried to transfer something to another account on the same day so I can't say for sure. I'd contact fidelity, everyone says they have great customer service."
03/30/2021,stocks,It's treated the same as money that's available for withdrawal I believe. So T+2. Can't move money that isn't settled.
03/30/2021,stocks,Any reason why? Are releasing something? Vizio is going crazy rn if you want a good stock to get in on
03/30/2021,stocks,Good luck! Timing the market is hard.

03/30/2021,stocks,"Ah ok, Brit here so hadn't heard about it"
03/30/2021,stocks,"Bull trap, dead cat bounce, theres a million names for it

Pretty much what they’re likely insinuating is that its going to go up a little before crashing back down again, its referred to as a trap because people see it going back up and buy, but then it drops short after because the downward trend was never over"
03/30/2021,stocks,"Watch the volume. If it surges on price increase it’s possible the stock is reversing. The OBV is an indicator that can help deciding.

It’s always a risk and IMO knowing the fundamental aspects of the underlying is very important. 

I’m not a pro by any stretch of the imagination and this isn’t financial advice. Just my 2 cents. 

Best of luck."

03/30/2021,stocks,"Yes, a couple months back I sold for a small loss."
03/30/2021,stocks,PLUG is up 10% today after dropping more than 50%. It's not safe to assume the downturn is over just yet
03/30/2021,stocks,"Agreed, I wonder if people are just not seeing it from a 5 year time frame but wanting shorter trades (which is totally fine, just a philosophy mismatch)"
03/30/2021,stocks,"And it was much weaker in late February-early March than it has been in this post-OPEX period (which has been dicey for 3 months so far). I think this time it went -3% from a record at its worst, back in late February-early March, it went -5% I believe. 

NDX hasn't been as weak either, it's fallen from a recent high, but the story of this post-OPEX period has been smalls getting absolutely smoked this time, which also hurts people on here."

03/30/2021,stocks,So no 35% corporate tax then?
03/30/2021,stocks,"Great question. Personally, I don't particularly want to go through the effort of creating an account, storing everything on a cold wallet/ledger, and then making sure I don't lose the password/encryption key, etc. 

Sure, buying the cryptocurrency directly is probably the better long term move, but I'm am happy for Greyscale to do the work for me at the moment.

I will say this - even though Greyscale generally trades these funds at a premium and charge a 2% fee, the premium is actually at a negative right now, so at the current prices you're actually paying is at a discount from the Net Asset Value (NAV) of Bitcoin."
03/30/2021,stocks,Oh I defo FOMO’d in and then paper handed my way out of that one. Another life lesson learned lol

03/30/2021,stocks,"I don't plan on timing it, just waiting until I safely believe that we've past the bottom. I won't be attempting to buy the dip though. Too much risk without enough long-term reward"
03/30/2021,stocks,"I hate giving ""picks"" especially with this year, but I still really like TSLA, NVDA, SQ, PYPL, CRWD, ETSY, ABNB, PINS for sure...ZM, LMND,APPN at their current prices but those are riskier. DIS as just a solid all around stock with little risk."

03/30/2021,stocks,90k at 5% Yeah it feels very nice. Thank you for the advice!
03/30/2021,stocks,That's why. It's a wash sale. So your losses from that are being carried into your cost basis.
03/30/2021,stocks,You don’t think apple stock dropping 65% would do serious damage to their company? My original statement wasn’t meant to be totally serious but okay.
03/30/2021,stocks,"I know that, the issue is not that I'm worried I'll get taxed, but rather I'm worried the rich will get taxed harshly, and pull their money out of the market while they have the chance, thus causing a major pullback."

03/30/2021,stocks,"Im just explaining what they mean by a trap, im not agreeing with them, although its usually best to wait for at the very least 2 or 3 green days in a row to rule out a bull trap entirely as its literally never possible to tell

*Something something* timing the market y’know

Edit: bull traps can absolutely last a week or two, a couple days isnt always enough to judge whether or not its a bull trap, but its still better to judge after a couple days as opposed to just today which someone earlier in the thread was doing"
03/30/2021,stocks,"It's called overexaggeration for contrast. In words you can understand, I was asking if he was going to sell for something actually important or just fun."
03/30/2021,stocks,lol you really think AAPL could drop anywhere near 65% without being bought up like hot cakes?  Statistically speaking you’re talking about one of the greatest companies in American history. You’re acting like it’s some kind of penny stock people will dump like hot garbage. There aren’t enough Apple shares on the face of the planet to fulfill the demand there would be anywhere close to that price level.
03/30/2021,stocks,"I'll assume you're young?  That myth has pervaded for 50 years.  Rich people ain't leaving.  Never have, never will.  They'll whine, gnash their teeth, threaten, terrorize, lobby, and then whine some more.  They'll pretend that the prospect of making a teeny tiny bit less than billions per year is so terrible a prospect that they're selling their Palm Springs and Manhattan residences and moving to Ireland or Vietnam.  Then they don't. 

Instead, they'll cry themselves to sleep on their mattresses of cash, and they'll quietly keep making loads and loads of money, often more than before the ""big"" tax hikes they said would ruin us all.    I've seen it scores of times over the years.  Any pullback you know for a fact is due to taxation is highly buyable."
03/30/2021,stocks,"No one is talking about PLUS and PLUS doesn’t have anything to do with hydrogen either.

03/30/2021,stocks,People always fear taxes way more then They should.
03/30/2021,stocks,"I like amd. 5% of my portfolio, I think they're only bottleneck will be how quickly they can make their chips. They're outperforming intel by a mile while being cheaper, every non-mac laptop maker will want amd chips."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Aight no worries, thanks for explaining! I try not to overthink my entry points cause i don’t believe im capable of judging the future. I just try keep my port balanced and ignore short term things like the bull trapp would be."
03/30/2021,stocks,2-3 days doesn't rule out a trap during a correction. There could be weeks of green followed by another huge plunge. I think most famous examples of dead cat bounces last more than just a few days.
03/30/2021,stocks,Yeah man it went over well.
03/30/2021,stocks,"Bold assumption to make, but you'd be right. While your argument is strong for individuals, what about corporations? The majority have been hit hard by covid. If corporation taxes are increased, it might put a lot of companies close to the edge of bankruptcy. They have lost a years profit, and making that profit back in the next 5 years to cover the expenses of this year sounds like a lot to ask for, even without tax hikes."
03/30/2021,stocks,If its a long term investment bull traps dont really matter much i agree
03/30/2021,stocks,"Lol idk what your deal is. Was genuinely trying to help a man but needed to know his situation, don't know why you did what you did"
03/30/2021,stocks,"It's not bold at all, if you're experienced in seeing this same panic be a nothing burger hundreds of times in a row.  It's as bold as saying the sun will rise tomorrow.

And, no, most corporations haven't been ""hit hard"" by COVID.  Mom and pop diners, yes.  Anyone big enough that we'd colloquially call them ""large corporations"" has been killing it.  All time high stock prices.  Massive buy backs.  Sick executive bonuses.  They haven't ""lost a year of profit"".  They've drank a bunch of extra profit milkshakes from small operators who can't compete with big corps.  

Look it up.  Home Depot. Microsoft. Rocket mortgage.  Deere.  Chipotle.  Netflix.  Every bank.  Google.  Record sales, record profits, record stock prices, everywhere.  The handful of exceptions are ones who will just see their streams be choppy, like Boeing, who had a trough and is now experiencing sales surges to catch up.  Unless you're thinking of AMC.  But I'm talking about the other 99.99%"
03/30/2021,stocks,Hey man thanks. It is for student loans. Since they have been deferred for over a year I have been investing the capital I would have otherwise used to pay them off. I gained a ton in 2020 and now I am cashing out and paying off close to 80% of the remainder of my debt. Dental school is very expensive lmao
2021-03-30 13:24:31,stocks,"Klarna - Possible 2022 IPo Hello investors, I don't know how familiar you are with Klarna. It's a Swedish fintech company aimed at making payments smooth and they have literally taken over Sweden the past few years, I've even seen some US companies use them. My question however, how does payments really work for the average American? I have never been in the US and have no idea on how you handle payments over there, what payment apps are you using when you buy from your go-to ecommerce places? I would appreciate you giving me some names so I can do some research and hopefully do a DD on Klarna before they go public in the US"
03/30/2021,stocks,"I dont like this company. They have a scummy way of doing business. They do as little as legally obligated to remind you about payment, the email reminder my gf got was basically designed to look like spam or just a confirmation.

Their business model seems to be taking advantage of people with little money to spend and then hope they forget to pay, so they can collect fees."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Are you a German/Austrian?  


I say this because this is based on my experience being in these two countries and the way they handle payments. Visa/Mastercard will beat out Klarna ALWAYS. This idea of buy-now, pay-later is the VISA/Mastercard model and has been around for a longtime and is so engrained in the culture in the US.

As far as Klarna, it's a good fintech for Europe because of the way banking is done as a whole across the EU.  


For the most part, payments are done simply with a credit card and/or paypal if you don't have a credit line to do so.. But, getting a credit card is so easy that you have to be in some serious serious credit debt in order to not have one.   


As far as paying Klarna. I can't see them really taking over the Klarna scene. The only reason why I think Paypal has a good stronghold is because it was a way for people to pay who didn't have a CC and it's sort of the best way to pay for things as far as a developer API if you wanna still pay with CC. it was highly integrated into a lot of e-commerce platforms."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Interesting one to keep an eye on. Here in the UK, I had never heard of it until recently (as a 41 year old male who doesn't really go in for fast fashion) but it's *huge* among the younger generation.  It's even a verb - ""I really wanted these shoes so I just klarna'ed them til payday"".

But I haven't come across it outside of fashion - is it used widely in other sectors in Sweden? Seems very much linked to youth culture etc - haven't seen it on sites for DIY or groceries!"
03/30/2021,stocks,"Klarna been getting quite a bit of bad press in the UK recently for getting young people into debt (main sites that seem to use them over here are fashion), so it'll be interesting to see if they can improve their image before going public.

Seems like there are much bigger players out there, though can't speak for their traction in other countries."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Klarna has recently taken over the NON-credit checkout process of the 2 of the Magic: The Gathering sites I use in the UK.
i.e. instead of Visa/Mastercard or PayPal, they just have Klarna - and it auto-populates all fields and uses your Visa card like any modern checkout. Credit is not offered.
As soon as I saw this - I was like - Klarna is gonna be huge.
They're clearly already global, and their APIs / UX seems extremely refined and fast (compared to the slow, flakey, inconsistent PayPal experience which opens of mini-windows and/or errors sometimes or doesn't return you to retailer correctly)... 
I actually see it as a good thing that they've moved away from purely 'bought on credit' opportunities - I would HATE to see a successful ""credit only"" company doing better than PayPal. 
It does worry me that young people are using credit for clothes (what does that say about our society?!).

Definitely one to watch."
03/30/2021,stocks,"their checkout solution also seems like a huge GDPR liability.

Basically, they offer checkout as a service to webshops to spy on the customers of that webshop and collect private information, even if you don't use klarna as a payment method. Then, accidentally, they start emailing those customers about Klarna: [https://www.bbc.com/news/business-54521820](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-54521820)"
03/30/2021,stocks,I consistently get at least 2 texts + email before payment is due. Maybe your girlfriend can look into her account settings? I don't recall setting it up myself but wouldn't hurt to take a peek.
03/30/2021,stocks,"Yes it's probably an easy way for them to increase margins. However if you do have cash and you are able to pay on time, i have to say it's a very easy and comfortable way to pay for items. I'm actually very bullish on this company."
03/30/2021,stocks,"I'm Swedish. I agree that the VISA/mastercard model seem to be the way right now. With Klarna however, you dont need a credit card, a debit card will work just fine. You have everything purchase related in the Klarna app, with everything leaning towards e-commerce. Klarna should have an edge, possibly even disrupting the visa/mastercard dominance."
03/30/2021,stocks,"It’s getting some traction in Australia, where [our biggest bank owns 5.5% of Klarna](https://www.commbank.com.au/articles/newsroom/2020/01/klarna-launches-in-australia-with-cba.html) already. It’s still nowhere as popular as AfterPay. 

It’s all fashion here as well."
03/30/2021,stocks,Sounds like a verb made-up by Klarna marketing.
03/30/2021,stocks,"I wouldn't say it's linked to the younger culture here in Sweden. Most of the companies have Klarna enabled when you checkout, you just tick a box and Klarna handles everything for you. I would even say it's even easier for the older generation to use it since there is no hassle with your card information CVC and so on."
03/30/2021,stocks,"It is used by everyone here in Sweden. I use it on sites for DIY (soldering iron, oscilloscope..) and computer parts. It is the fastest checkout option here in Sweden."

TSLA: $586B market cap with $31.5B revenue (2020)

Cheap is not the word I would use for these stocks. I would instead use ""better entry point"". I'm being picky because ""cheap"" is not something we should use so disparagingly due to future ramifications based on our current perceptions.

For example, buying TSLA at $700 after the first major dip from $800 seemed ""cheap"", but we see that that was not the case.

Your view on price movement is true to an extent, but I personally find it fun reading theories on the movements. Like the ‘illogical’ price movement makes analyzing/expecting future prices pointless, but looking back at previous swings is always interesting.

The rockets and repetitive language is precisely why I’d like a discussion here than there. Just perma ban folks that comment that here to avoid them or something."

03/30/2021,stocks,"Even then, according to Ortex, SI is at 24.17%, that is a lot higher than most other stocks, but borrow rate is still unusually low in comparison. I will look into more data tomorrow."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Haha my bad, checked the price real quick. Either way it was pretty frustrating to watch it go up about 1000% 2 days after Fidelity wouldn't let me buy. Talking about the 6+ cent spike in February."
03/30/2021,stocks,"I consider the ev space really speculative besides GM, F, and Telsla to an extent, I don’t see why it wouldn’t be a bad idea to play NGA especially if you have conviction in it but I wouldn’t make it a big position or big holding in a portfolio but that’s just me."

You mean rumours and wild ass guesses? There are no less than three subs basically dedicated to GME at this point. Why add another one?"
03/30/2021,stocks,1 mill is a low ball
03/30/2021,stocks,Yeah those people are delusional. I'm willing to wager that the vast majority has a few shares hoping for an early retirement. Little did they know..
03/30/2021,stocks,"Quantity ≠ quality, three biased, hive minded subs dont make a good one.

And is Elliot Wilke joining Gamestop also another rumour and a wild ass guess?"
03/30/2021,stocks,You guys just so sound so mad on this sub lmao
03/30/2021,stocks,"I agree with you strongly. I'm not sure whether to exit or hold and of course if you go anywhere else to discuss this the answer is ""HODL"""
03/30/2021,stocks,"Yeah, I'm so mad about the $25,000 gains I made since January from GME. I've got horses in this race still, but I'm not betting on 100k+, so yeah, I'm taking profits where I can get them."
03/30/2021,stocks,Yeah sorry for not following the 100k per share narattive.
03/30/2021,stocks,"It’s not really about having people tell me whether to hold or not, I personally like the stock and hence like discussing any developments regarding it.

But I’d rather those discussions be rational and not outright ludicrous.

What I just don’t get is how a ticker can cause this much mayhem and not be discussed at a ‘stocks’ subreddit."
03/30/2021,stocks,I just think it’s funny how this sub writes the stock off as a meme stock when if you follow the the actual fundamentals it’s a great value stock that’s revolutionizing the company into an e-commerce powerhouse. The whole board is being restructured and is in a great place for the future.
03/30/2021,stocks,People would jump on for saying you made gains from gme and don't follow the hold thing.. Since when making a profit is a bad thing? Like wtf with this bs.
03/30/2021,stocks,"I like the stock too, I just am bag holding because I bought right at the top and not sure what to do. I wish I entered at a better price point so I could confidently hold onto it. I just don't know if it will be worth what I bought at. 

And I agree, it's not about being told what to do, it's reading solid discussion about it so I can have a more informed opinion on the stock itself. 

And it doesn't make sense to me either. This is the biggest stock market news since the '08 crash and this subreddit has taken a hard-line stance against discussion of it."
03/30/2021,stocks,Inb4 2m is the floor
03/30/2021,stocks,"That's exactly why I haven't sold all my shares. My problem isn't with GME, it's with the subreddits. If we go to the moon, I'll be right there with you, but in the mean time, I have goals in life I can pursue after riding some of these waves. I'm not a day-trader, but I'm also not a diamond handed ape. I'm going to keep making decisions on my finances based on what's good for me, and the rhetoric on those subs actively goes against making decisions for yourself.

Edit: I accidentally a word."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Which is why I stopped posting on those subs. GME has allowed me to pay off all my debt and put a nice chunk of change towards a down payment on a house. If it hits 100k, I'm still a multimillionaire, but for now I have more reasonable goals."
03/30/2021,stocks,"There are sayings somewhere along the lines of:

Stock market is a place to transfer wealth from impatient ones to patient ones.

If there is a 10% of chance of 10x gains then you should take that chance 100% of the time.

You should ask yourself what has changed since you bought the shares and if nothing else has changed besides the price then you just need to have patience."

It isn't."

03/30/2021,stocks,This is pretty much in line with my mindset too.
03/30/2021,stocks,"I mean, they always quarantined us to the daily meme stock thread, which makes me feel like the red headed step child, but this week was the first week I can tell that /r/stocks is kind of over GME.

If you find a subreddit somewhere in the middle, let me know, but lately I've been doing more self-learning and trying to come up with my own conclusions and strategies. It's nice to clear your head once in a while after standing in between thousands of people screaming at each other to hodl."
2021-03-30 13:17:23,stocks,"Missing cost basis prior to 2011 How does one track down missing cost basis Prior to 2011. Multiple positions in a trust account not entitled to stepped up basis at death?  Broker does not have records prior to 2007 for this account.   

The account was moved from one broker to another in 2007.  But there are no records of cost basis when they were transferred.  Cost basis reporting rules changed in 2010 requiring brokers to track going forward.

The account has done quite well so I’m not sure how to deal with determining unknown share cost for tax reporting.  

CPA has asked me to determine pricing for their estate reporting.  Again the shares are not entitled to stepped up basis due to the type of trust account they have been held."
03/30/2021,stocks,Guess the date you bought it and then look up the historic stock price. If it paid dividends and you are not sure the reinvested value I believe there is software which will compute this for you but it’s not free. What your CPA is looking for is a best guesstimate.

03/30/2021,stocks,AMZN?? I thought cathie sold AMZN the other day
03/30/2021,stocks,"Not thrilled with the holdings, but I bought 15 - those funds all do well over time, willing to take that risk on this one at $20 each."
03/30/2021,stocks,"DASSAULT SYSTEMES is hands down my favorite company of the bunch. 

They are the main player for design, simulation, and PLM software in the aerospace industry. They use a SaaS model, and as long as there's active engineering in the space, their products will be used. 

The play is akin to 'selling shovels during the gold rush'."
03/30/2021,stocks,Those holdings all suck. Not much to do with space if at all.
03/30/2021,stocks,"It’s too risk averse , aren’t they changing the rules for their etfs and are risking thinks a little bit more"
03/30/2021,stocks,Anyone know what price it’s set to start at?
03/30/2021,stocks,Not touching that or anything ARK at the moment
03/30/2021,stocks,Not much to get excited about in there!
03/30/2021,stocks,Heard you like ETFs so we put some ETFs in your ETF so you can pay fees while you pay fees.
03/30/2021,stocks,It could be from another fund. I have seen AMZN in other ARK ETFs.
03/30/2021,stocks,"She uses big tech as ""cash"". She doesn't want to buy a handful of shares of small cap stocks, make them run up a bunch, and then have to buy a bunch more as people put money in the ETF. So I think she's got those holdings there until she's raised money, and then will buy into those smaller names and SPACs."
03/30/2021,stocks,"AMZN is still in ARKF, not sure about the others as i dont hold them"
03/30/2021,stocks,Same 20 is a Good price
03/30/2021,stocks,You don’t think the first moon base will need landscaping equipment from John Deere? They’ll be poised to be the first.
03/30/2021,stocks,it seems like ark has gone more conservative route this time for sure
03/30/2021,stocks,"What are some public companies that are deep into the space market currently? I guess, what would you rather see in there? 

It's not like they can put spacex in. It's a private company who's been choosing investment partners pretty carefully."
03/30/2021,stocks,It's around $20
03/30/2021,stocks,More like not touching the market at the moment.
03/30/2021,stocks,Agreed. If past is prologue then we should be fine here
03/30/2021,stocks,"Unless JD starts building radiation resistant equipment for the moon base, no I don't think so.   
Lets be real... this ETF is just another ETF composed of random shit to maximize the number of ETFs for the purpose of collecting fees.  More ETFs ARK pumps out = more fees.   
The real purpose of this ETF is to generate fees. Has nothing to do with ""investing"" in space exploration. Absolutely nothing."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Northrop Grumman, Leidos, Safran, and Maxar to start. Since there is an air taxi SPAC in the ETF I think it would make sense to include the space SPACs as well."
03/30/2021,stocks,I think Muskrat has said he’ll never go public because he doesn’t want to answer to anyone.
03/30/2021,stocks,Why? Stay away from the NASDAQ but most everything else is doing really well.
2021-03-30 13:00:43,stocks,"Is ARK totally crazy? ARK's new space ETF makes no sense at all. The second largest position is another ETF. Also included are: JD.COM, NVIDIA, DEERE&CO, AMAZON, ALPHABET, GARMIN, ALIBABA, NETFLIX. And those are just the inappropriate companies I knew about without having to look. Is ARK preparing us to watch netflix while mowing the lawn on mars?

I am only surprised that there is no TSLA inside. Does anyone know what this is about? I realize that there are not many ""space"" stocks, but then I leave the project instead of filling the ETF with illogical companies.

EDIT: To all those who complain here with ""But amazon has satellites in space"": Tesla also offers insurance to a few customers in California. Does that make it belong in an insurer ETF? No! For most companies like Amazon, Netflix or John Deere, the part that has something to do with space or profits from space is less than 5%. Not even remotely worth mentioning, that doesn't justify inclusion in such an ETF.


Here I have a link to the list of holdings:

https://ark-funds.com/wp-content/fundsiteliterature/holdings/ARK_SPACE_EXPLORATION_&_INNOVATION_ETF_ARKX_HOLDINGS.pdf"
03/30/2021,stocks,Let’s also not forget that Cathie wood put one of her own etfs In this etf
03/30/2021,stocks,"You’re all missing the point. These are all companies that will benefit from space exploration. Take Netflix for example. Already most people you know will either have their own account or share someone else’s. So how can they continue to expand their user base? By exploring space and discovering alien civilisations, that’s how. They can then sell their monthly subscriptions to these aliens."
03/30/2021,stocks,"The second-largest holding is PRNT, another Ark ETF, that I already have. In fact, I already have/can get exposure to many of these companies in various other ETFs. ARKX is going to evolve and will look very different in 5 years and especially 10. In the meantime, it doesn't really excite me."
03/30/2021,stocks,"You interpret space wrong, she doesnt mean literal space(rocket stocks) she means stocks that will moon."
03/30/2021,stocks,"U forget the best space stock of them all, WKHS...

edit: I am not kidding, it is literally in her space ETF"
03/30/2021,stocks,"As far as I can tell it's not really space exploration but anything somewhat space related. Nvidia makes chips that AI's need that will be put on rockets. Amazon, Alphabet, Garmin probably own a bunch of satellites floating around in space. Alphabet also owns like 8% of SpaceX. Not really sure about the rest, especially Netflix lol"
03/30/2021,stocks,"If we're talking about Space ETFs we're probably thirty or forty years too early for that. Closest company to it is SpaceX and one company is hardly enough for an ETF.

I would not use this ETF as a vehicle as it appears that even the creator doesn't know what the goal will be."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Please read about ARK Strategies.. Blue Chips are also their Cash-Equivalent, that they will sell to free more capital."
03/30/2021,stocks,"I agree the space ETF looks very silly, and I would definitely not invest in it.  But the thing that really soured me was the Tesla price target.  You could be the most bullish person in the world on Tesla and its still nonsensical to have a bear case of $1,500 in 2025.  At best its terrible analysis and if you wanted to be more cynical you could even call it negligent or a form of attempted price manipulation.

I dont really care what upside you want to project out, if you think Tesla is going to take over the world and be worth $50,000 in 5 years thats your prerogative.  But to not even acknowledge that its possible things go wrong or dont work out is just bad investment analysis plain and simple and makes me think they dont really know what theyre doing."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Dont worry, Im sure tesla will find its way in."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Not all of these holdings are as crazy as they first appear, if you look at the space INDUSTRY as a whole, and not just launch providers.

Now, I can't speak to netflix, but the near-term focus in the space industry is colonization of the moon (with hopes of Mars thereafter) & space mining.

Nvidia -  [https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/news/events/ai-innovation-challenge.html](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/news/events/ai-innovation-challenge.html) The Nvidia Jetson platform is being utilized by multiple aerospace/defense giants to power AI advances. Currently those are aimed at terrestrial drones, but don't think for a minute that successes there won't be utilized to improve unmanned spaceflight

Deere & Co / Komatsu - [https://www.nasa.gov/feature/directorates/spacetech/spinoff/john\_deere/](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/directorates/spacetech/spinoff/john_deere/) NASA has already began a partnership with John Deere to improve autonomous driving tractors. This and similar investments are being rolled into future development of lunar (and asteroid) mining vehicles (hence Komatsu). Honestly, I am suprised Caterpillar isn't in their holdings as well. [https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/23/caterpillar-and-nasa-developing-autonomous-vehicles-to-mine-the-moon.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/23/caterpillar-and-nasa-developing-autonomous-vehicles-to-mine-the-moon.html)

Garmin - This one is too easy. If your plan is for autonomous mining drones working on the lunar surface and beyond, you're going to need to have a way for them to orient themselves and move around. Guess what doesn't work on the far side of the moon? GPS. Entirely new navigation infrastructure will likely need to be built and companies that have experience harnessing similar systems will have a leg up.

Everybody keeps talking about how uninspired and disappointed they are with this ETF's holdings, but I think if you look past the flashy SpaceX news headlines, they've got a pretty good pulse on what is *actually* happening in space."
03/30/2021,stocks,"ARK is basically just very good at marketing towards retail investors who have no idea what they are doing and just like the title 'SPACE EXPLORATION'.  


It's a joke of an ETF. The other reason is probably cause there isn't enough space stocks to actually create a real ETF for it to be diversified lol"
03/30/2021,stocks,"I came into this thread hoping to learn something new but holy shit some people should just stick with index funds and forget the stock market. One guy is criticizing ARK thinking it's a space company. OP thinks ARK is crazy because John Deere, Netflix, etc are inappropriate to him/her.

1. ARK is not a ""space exploration company"" (I can't believe I even have to say this shit)  
2. Agtech benefits greatly from space and satellite developments. John Deere has partnerships with NASA to use satellite guidance systems to develop GPS-based self-driving tractors/combines/etc. They also benefit from improved weather analysis, crop health, field conditions, etc.
3. As someone else already mentioned Netflix stands to benefit by increasing their TAM when Starlink comes successful and they achieve worldwide coverage, altho I think its prolly a cash reserve for Cathie like her other ETFs.  

To top it all off, Gordon Gekko Jr here is calling Cathie a liar and thinks he's smarter because he has no fucking clue how all these companies and sectors are involved."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Looks at those share totals...there is next to no money in that fund yet and this could look quite different by the end of the day.  

I would think they don't want everyone to be frontrunning them and I suspect they'll open some new positions today."
03/30/2021,stocks,Man...tossing $PRNT in there at 6.03% of the ETF is fucking insane. I wouldn't touch this with a 30-foot pole.
03/30/2021,stocks,"A journey to Mars takes a lot of time, probably months. There will be a need for entertainment like Netflix. Makes sense to me. Can’t go tits up."
03/30/2021,stocks,Kinda disappointed with this . Was really looking forward to it . I’ll pass . Rocket labs is my space play right now .
03/30/2021,stocks,if buying gimmicky products is your style...
03/30/2021,stocks,"ETF contains 6% of their own PRNT ETF.
Is this normal?"
03/30/2021,stocks,"How in the world is Garmin inappropriate. 

People need to chill. You dont like it, don't invest in it. 

Perhaps Cathie doesn't like the price point or market conditions for all these ""Space"" stocks everyone is demanding to be in there. And maybe she's using these large blue-chip stocks as cash reservoirs like she does in literally every other actively-managed ARK ETF. 

Maybe check out UFO if you want all the companies that everyone ""knows"" are going to the moon. But spoiler: Garmin's in there too."
03/30/2021,stocks,"*""I did absolutely no research on why some of these stocks are in ARKs Space ETF, so I have no idea why they're in there. Logical conclusion: ARK must be totally crazy!!!""*

Makes sense..."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Because she thinks (rightly to some degree) that marketing is more important than the truth.

Idiots will be like omg Space is the future. As long as the ETF's performace is somewhat decent nobody will bitch about it while thinking they are investing in the new frontier."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Everyone here assuming this is the final ETF. Do you really think they’re going to include everything in this fund right off the bat and drive up stock prices and low float stocks like crazy? Why? I’m assuming they want to buy cheaper stocks..

They will change what is in this portfolio over time and purchase stocks that were originally supposed to be in the ETF to begin with. 

These people aren’t idiots... they’re highly educated, well funded, and experienced money managers. The entire internet somehow thinks they have more competence than this team. 

I’m going to put my bets on ARK..."
03/30/2021,stocks,"She’s just jumping on the bandwagon because space stocks are going to get hot.  So many SPACs are bringing so many rocket and satellite companies to market over next few years.  Plus Cathie is bundling in the other companies (which may have a little to do with space exploration or not) to pad her bra.  I think she missed this one coming and threw something together at the last minute, like I used to when I had an essay due in college...."
03/30/2021,stocks,I think issue is a lack of proper space stocks that will make the etf money. I imagine she plans to pick stocks to make money until spacex ipos.
03/30/2021,stocks,Are these not placeholders?
03/30/2021,stocks,Hot take: I think the whole industry is over priced. So she is adding a bunch of stable large caps for the launch then rotating in the smaller space plays after those evaluations get more inline with reality.
03/30/2021,stocks,"I don't know about Netflix, but Alphabet is the only way to indirectly own Space-X afaik.

But yeah, sounds pretty much crazy - just like using the space tag to collect money with totally unrelated stuff.


Question from a fellow Viennese: I cant buy ARK anymore due to european regulations - flatex used to sell it but they stopped. Do you know a reasonable way of buying as european citizen?"
03/30/2021,stocks,Netflix got space movies lol
03/30/2021,stocks," It says ARK SPACE EXPLORATION & **INNOVATION** ETF. So I'm guessing they wanted a space-related ETF with around 40-50 companies, but there are no that many good space companies so it's more like innovation in general with a focus on space. Maybe in the future, they will increasingly focus on space stuff."
03/30/2021,stocks,"I'll demonstrate why you don't get it.   


Step 1: Place a penny on the floor  
Step 2: Pace a basketball on the floor to the right of the penny.

Step 3: Take a step back and look at the two side by side.   


Your brain is on the left. Cathie's brain is on the right."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Nvidia, Amazon, and alphabet...if you can’t understand how those would be essential for space in the future then you may not actually have a grasp on things..."
03/30/2021,stocks,At least she didn’t get disney.to infinity and beyond! -Buzz
03/30/2021,stocks,These will be suppliers and network beneficiaries from growth in the space sector. Dunno what is so unbelievable about that.
03/30/2021,stocks,Wood hasn’t shown her hand yet. It’s day 1. Let’s all stay grounded here (no pun intended)
03/30/2021,stocks,You mean the ETF's that are reliant on praying to god for financial advice?  NAH....
03/30/2021,stocks,Cathy Wood is gonna be a fad that won’t be remembered. In a few years she will just be a few paragraphs on Wikipedia as her ETFs become insolvent and she is sitting in a prison cell.
03/30/2021,stocks,Yikes there’s also a lot of arms dealers in there. Not for me.
03/30/2021,stocks,These are companies that benefit from expanding space tech. I.E. Netflix can triple its possible customer pool as satelites expand internet access to everyone on the planet.
03/30/2021,stocks,"ARK is overrated. If you want to follow trades and hold bags for someone with way more money than you, you might as well follow PJ."
03/30/2021,stocks,"They are placeholders because there are barely any space stocks 

Lots of spacs going to start bringing companies to market like rocketlab hence why she bought ACIC"
03/30/2021,stocks,"Yes, but people see space and will buy into it because they are the same idiots buying GME, AMC, etc."
03/30/2021,stocks,Wait are there etfs filled with etfs?
03/30/2021,stocks,"100% on jesus, can't go wrong."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Cathie wood is crazy, so yeah I think ark is pretty nutty too"
03/30/2021,stocks,"After the Tesla valuation i decided Cathie is a nut. This just confirms it. Though some of the stocks you mentioned kind of make sense like Garmin, which I guess she likes for navigation"
03/30/2021,stocks,"Nflx ? Need to watch movies in space , John Deere need to mow the space grass"
03/30/2021,stocks,"Just pray to god, that's how Cathie Wood invests!"
03/30/2021,stocks,"Pretty sure seeing as this holds NFLX ol' Cathie expects Reed Hastings' firm to offer either a subscription to Humans in Space... or maybe even Aliens who want to watch derivative shows on Space Broadband and can't get enough of how inventive and creative the offerings on NFLX are?

I'm more of a cryo technology guy for deep space exploration unless we can crack Warp speeds, so no NFLX in Space for me."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Alphabet and Amazon have satellite, drones... innovation going on. They market this ETF as ""space"" but it but much better to call it airborne because it includes aerial stuff like drones"
03/30/2021,stocks,I fell asleep to meet Kevin reviewing this last night.   Several of the companies have small tentacles of the company that reach into space.    Such as the one company is construction based but has a laser and gps branch. So maybe some kind of remote planet surveying?  Lol 😂
03/30/2021,stocks,Garmin does stuff with GPS so it makes some sense in a way. Also a pretty good company now versus when it was just a car GPS company in the 2000s.
03/30/2021,stocks,Jumped the shark on Mars?
03/30/2021,stocks,"A lot of sector ETFs do this. I've looked at some of the ETFs that have as their goal to invest in companies involved in robotics and artificial intelligence and you'll find a lot of Amazon and Google in those, as well.  Part of the reason is that some of those large companies have their hands in many different areas.  Yes, Amazon and Google are both involved in AI, but that's a very small part of what they do.  Another part of this is it gives the ETF some stability.

I can't specifically explain why Netflix and Deere would be in ARKX. It makes no sense to me, as well. But clearly something that those companies are doing is being utilized by the companies that are going into space.  I know that Deere, for instance, has been doing a lot of research on automating farming (specifically farm tractors) and possibly the AI they are working on in that field has an application in some area of space exploration, as well."
03/30/2021,stocks,Amazon or at least the former ceo is space affiliated the others I don’t quite understand.
03/30/2021,stocks,The only reason I'd invest in this is because she's gonna get a good deal on starlink when it IPO's in a year or two. Then ARKX is gonna moon similarly like how it mooned thanks to TSLA.
03/30/2021,stocks,Kensho Final Frontiers ROKT is an alternative space and deep sea ETF
03/30/2021,stocks,Gotta fill it with something and there's only so many space stocks right now.
03/30/2021,stocks,This was so disappointing. Was looking forward to ARKX. Let’s see if she switches things up but so far I don’t want my money in that fund.
03/30/2021,stocks,"Some good could come out of this.  It looks like Cathy would be totally open to investing in Robert Rodriguez so he can make ""Machete in Space""."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Yeah that is an odd lineup, just do the 6 that there are lol."
03/30/2021,stocks,do you really think they are going to waste weight bringing Bluerays to space?

03/30/2021,stocks,UFO is much more interesting for space companies. I was really disappointed with this new etf.
03/30/2021,stocks,I feel like Cathie is slowly losing her mojo.
03/30/2021,stocks,"Well Amazon makes sense because they're planning to compete with Starlink with their own satellite mesh network. Garmin too because satellites (inreach products).

That being said, I wouldn't touch this ETF with a 10 foot pole."
03/30/2021,stocks,What about UFO instead?
03/30/2021,stocks,Gotta do something on Mars! Driving John deeres and watching the flix!
03/30/2021,stocks,SRAC is worth watching if you're interested in space stuff. They are merging with Momentus space infrastructure company. I like spac's that are merging with brands that have actual/tangible products and business models. SRAC is one of those.
03/30/2021,stocks,"Lockheed Martin, spce, maxr , ba, ktos, ajrd, etc. Even fuel companies or chemical labs. Weird choices"
03/30/2021,stocks,Making room for spacex! JD has some pretty incredible software for farming....super handy on the moon. Likely don’t want to spend all day in a pressurized suit so why not Netflix and float? Did people still buy some?
03/30/2021,stocks,I mean Netflix had a space show...
03/30/2021,stocks,The Ark going to mars docu soon on Netflix
03/30/2021,stocks,So don’t you believe in Virgin Galactic?
03/30/2021,stocks,Its called space + innovation not 100% space etf
03/30/2021,stocks,"They were expecting Starlink to merge with PSTH by now, but Elon wanted Bill to push it back to 4/20 for maximum meme. Don't worry, Starlink along with many other SPACs will be in ARKX soon"

it is not just space exploration, it is also about stocks she think is innovating the industry"
03/30/2021,stocks,I mean looking at her it looks like she is high 24/7 so.
03/30/2021,stocks,Ever since the god speech I believe she just picked meme stocks and got luck with the rise and will go the way of Hwang.
03/30/2021,stocks,"Yo dawg! We heard you like etfs, so we put an etf in your etf."

03/30/2021,stocks,She just needs to sell one subscription to Jesus to break even.
03/30/2021,stocks,Ahh thx man! Makes sense a lot now! Cathie Woods is a genius!!
03/30/2021,stocks,"At the same time, it could be a nice time to get in @ $20 and just wait."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Agreed. ARKQ is great IMO, a better bet"
03/30/2021,stocks,Honestly she should have just setup a CEF that picked up SpaceX private shares on the secondary.
03/30/2021,stocks,And tesla is already on Mars so no need to add it. It all makes sense.
03/30/2021,stocks,your username made me laugh
03/30/2021,stocks,LMFAO
03/30/2021,stocks,THIS
03/30/2021,stocks,she's pumping. ark-Q bought 60k shares of Workhorse yesterday.
03/30/2021,stocks,Netflix has movies about space
03/30/2021,stocks,"As usual when it comes to thinking about what the world will be like more than 1 year in the future people completely miss the point.

Ark’s space exploration ETF isn’t just about launchers.  It’s about which industries will benefit most greatly from the coming space technology convergence.  This will cause an exponential reduction in cost of payload to orbit, which will have many wide ranging effects.

Perfect example: Netflix.  Netflix has 200M customers today.  They’re close to reaching a saturation point whereby the only way they can continue to grow their subscriber base is by increasing the amount of bandwidth available to people across the globe.  Mega constellations like Starlink are poised to do just that.  This may double (or more) Netflix’s TAM which increases their scale, which lets them invest more efficiently and be more profitable.

This seems like an obvious space exploration play, and I’m not sure why people are having such a hard time seeing this.  If payload to LEO drops from $10,000 lbs/kg as it was in just the 2000’s to $10 lbs/kg as it is projected to in the next 5 years high bandwidth consuming content providers with massive scale will benefit immensely."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Might as well throw in chipotle and cola, since astronauts need food in space."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Peoples always miss the point, here I am only speculating, but Netflix yes they do great shows/documentaries but their API framework NetflixOSS does really solves some heffy problems for Data at scales and distributed systems and I can see them doing something with this and taking the Amazon/Google road to diversify."
03/30/2021,stocks,Netflix could launch its own satellites or its own internet or something idk
03/30/2021,stocks,Alphabet is because of their AI tech that will be crucial in pushing the space sector forward.
03/30/2021,stocks,"In the past she said she wouldn't invest in alphabet, because there are better opportunities."
03/30/2021,stocks,You have RocketLab which is going public via Spac... next best thing IMO...
03/30/2021,stocks,MDA is going public. Canadian company that made the Canadarm. It will be in there.
03/30/2021,stocks,"Exactly, why just not leave it for a while and wait until there are more companies"
03/30/2021,stocks,Is there not more to be announced?
03/30/2021,stocks,"ANSYS is a good inclusion, that's modeling/simulation software that allows for finite element analysis of complex structures & even layered composites, you can create a mesh using CAD software, run it through CFD software, then analyze in ANSYS. Heavily used in Aerospace industry. I may buy a couple shares of that. Guidance/orbital trajectory tech should be in there if it's not. Trimble does some Geospatial, they must be high on them as it's the biggest holding."
03/30/2021,stocks,"It would make sense to include companies that are crafting the alloys, the rocket fuel, etc.  SpaceX has to buy these materials from _someone_, and it's likely that these companies would continue to be the main supplier for space companies in the future."
03/30/2021,stocks,"I mean there are multiple companies that create satellites and put them into orbit, seems much more like “space” than Netflix."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Well, I sold my Virgin Galactic at 110% gain within a month this winter.  Tourism will be decades ahead of the rest of the gang."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Can't believe I had to scroll this far down for this comment. Guaranteed she buys into more space holdings in the near future. 

Think about it, why would she want to tell the world about some small caps/spacs that she's gonna buy, BEFORE she has money to buy them? That would run the price up ahead of her buying.

She is raising money right now, and once there is a decent chunk of money in there she'll sell those large cap tech stocks and buy into more small cap space stocks.

This was also her whole strategy against corrections. She moved money into big tech when she felt like the market was overvalued. When the correction hit she moved back into her small stocks that she believes in. She knows that these smaller stocks are volatile and is mitigating that risk as much as possible."
03/30/2021,stocks,Finally an answer that makes sense.  Do you have any source for this?
03/30/2021,stocks,"Yup.  This is the ARK strategy: When the seas get rough, Cathy tosses the big strong animals overboard so she can keep the small weak animals aboard."
03/30/2021,stocks,But Cathie wood stupid Christian woman lmao ark go down now so she suck
03/30/2021,stocks,"In her defence if you put bull case at $4000 and expected at $3000. You can’t really put bear case at $500. That just sounds like your saying, well the price could crash or go up as a price target."
03/30/2021,stocks,The thing that soured me was how religious she is. Maybe the TSLA price target requires faith to make sense
03/30/2021,stocks,"google sells your porn history, eps 60, makes a hella less sense"
03/30/2021,stocks,"The thing with the $1500 bear case target is relatively simple and can indeed make sense. Here is the explanation in one sentence: ARK thinks the true value of Tesla's intangible assets is massively undervalued today, meaning in the worst of scenarios if Tesla was to be liquidated it would account for a value that is around $1500 x Total shares. The problem is that Tesla is in a highly competitive sector and its hard to grasp how fast others will catch up until 2025."
03/30/2021,stocks,There’s one already in space
03/30/2021,stocks,With 30% weight thanks to her ETF rules loosening
03/30/2021,stocks,"That would make more sense than some other stocks.
SpaceX wants to use a modified Cybertruck on Mars"
03/30/2021,stocks,"If anyone is curious about navigating in GPS-lacking environments, check out the DOD’s Assured PNT project. There’s a handful of very early development and emerging technologies that allow it to operate in GPS compromised environments. 

Space force will clearly gain from it but as will all the other branches. That’s a huge customer for companies looking to provide new capabilities for navigation"
03/30/2021,stocks,"There are some space companies but a lot of them are spacs , momentus, astra, blacksky, spire, rocket lab , space mobile ast . And also why is there no maxar very disappointed in her."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Hell there’s enough space stocks... virgin galactic, Boeing, Lockheed, Northrop Grumman, tech companies making guidance like Raytheon, geo satellite companies, companies that make satellite dishes/ tech/ long range communication, geo- farming greenhouse companies, rare earth metals that are used to make space/ tech/ nuclear power, solar companies (is there oil on Mars? Idk)... those are just a few off the top of my head. This is a friggin joke."
03/30/2021,stocks,"I think the problem here is retail investors. When something is not marketed to us, we shout out that it’s a foul play and the “smart money” thinks we are dumb. When something is marketed to us, we claim that it’s the fund’s marketing tactic."
03/30/2021,stocks,"There are PLENTY spacs stocks:

VACQ SFTW NSH GNPK"
03/30/2021,stocks,There was space to fill in her list.
03/30/2021,stocks,So you think they kinda want to scam retail investors?
03/30/2021,stocks,I have to imagine that actual space exploration companies won’t be profitable anytime soon. Probably why it’s being filled with extremely loosely related large caps.
03/30/2021,stocks,"You sound like a moron.
The etf is about space exploration nobody says ark is a space exploration company.

Almost every company on earth benefits from having more internet.

It doesnt even have Northrop and costs 0,75 in expense ratio. QQQ and VOO are better space exploration etfs by that logic"
03/30/2021,stocks,"Yep ""only"" a few billion dollars. That's only slightly more than my average bar tab."
03/30/2021,stocks,I see you did your DD.
03/30/2021,stocks,Yo dawg...
03/30/2021,stocks,"GPS systems need satellites, and those are in space, so...

But seriously, they do a lot of avionics work, not just GPS devices."
03/30/2021,stocks,">Idiots will be like omg Space is the future.

It's pretty easy to say that now, similar to how it would have been easy to say the same thing about air travel when it was still just some lunatics flying kites with lawnmower engines.

I think you'd be an idiot to think space *isn't* the future. We already have private companies making a profit on it and seriously planning interplanetary travel, with others hot on their heals. Other companies have literally already sold tickets to people to travel into orbit. The biggest military on the planet by orders of magnitude has a Space branch for gods sake."
03/30/2021,stocks,idk tbh 😬
03/30/2021,stocks,"Someone smarter than me would not make the bald statement, that tesla will be worth 1500$ in worst case."
03/30/2021,stocks,Right? Especially Considering Alphabet owns like 9% of SpaceX. Most of these are obvious if you’re paying attention.
03/30/2021,stocks,"Yeah I am dumb. Not cathie is a liar and selling a normal ETF to unexperienced investors (her main crowd) and tables it as ""Spacegarbage"" because it sounds nice and then include her other ETF as second highest holding."
03/30/2021,stocks,John Deer?
03/30/2021,stocks,a lot of the arms dealers are some of the biggest players in space
03/30/2021,stocks,why are you pretty sure? Isn’t it just a filler for holding cash before it gets allocated to actual etf specific stocks?
03/30/2021,stocks,"A good deal? No, it'll IPO and she'll buy for her funds just like we do."
03/30/2021,stocks,"This means space exploration and space innovation not innovation in general lmao.

Every pick has a short discription as to why its in there.
None are just innovation in general."
03/30/2021,stocks,I can't wrap my head around the future role of John deer in space.
03/30/2021,stocks,She should put ARKX into that ETF.
03/30/2021,stocks,Etfception..

03/30/2021,stocks,Not quite but more than current expense ratio.  but sure it would increase the fee range.  GOD IS GOING TO punish her for that.  The flood might be coming.  And their is a hole in that boat.
03/30/2021,stocks,"I don't get this line of thought/comment I see thrown around for ARKX (and in general). $20 means absolutely *nothing*, especially true with an ETF, at least with stocks while it is flawed you can easily bring it back to outstanding shares or do historic comparisons when buybacks or dilution are at play. Do you mean that it's holdings are affordable at the moment instead, or $20 sounds cheap?"
03/30/2021,stocks,Opportunity cost says hello
03/30/2021,stocks,No doubt. Especially knowing this could look very different in 5 to 10 years.
03/30/2021,stocks,Price is completely arbitrary.....
03/30/2021,stocks,"Yeah, I'm in ARKQ and ARKF. IMO these are technologies that are already very successful and are essentially just in the process of becoming more successful.

ARKW / ARKG / PRNT / ARKX to me seem much more like gambles on technology that doesn't exist or isn't profitable yet."
03/30/2021,stocks,Tesla right now is on Mars coming back from the outside of solar system back to Earth.

03/30/2021,stocks,"Exactly. I don't understand why everybody is taking these tickers completely at face value. Like, no shit Netflix isn't a rocket company, but they stand to benefit immensely from the technological advancements coming with space exploration."

This is the first I have heard of this - sounds nuts. Any articles or anything that talk about this?"
03/30/2021,stocks,People have a hard time seeing things because it's mostly about gags than any analysis. Watching Netflix in space got more upvotes than any comments that try to reason about the actual matter at hand. Are most people stupid enough to think that someone is going to watch Netflix in space? No. It's just all about a funny punchline.
03/30/2021,stocks,It IS very obvious why Netflix is in the ETF and it has been mentioned a few times. But it's funnier to just shit on the ETF because Ark investments brought many people losses here.
03/30/2021,stocks,How many lbs do you save by beaming a Netflix stream to your space ship vs. lugging a ton of hard drives full of entertainment for your months long trip to Mars?
03/30/2021,stocks,I work at ARK. Thank you for that suggestion.
03/30/2021,stocks,"RL is a far better space company than ARK, I say as someone who follows and understands space/rocketry more than the average person.  That doesn't mean that will translate into stock price on wall street, but they are fundamentally a sound company that can deliver with re-usability and can build their next rocket in a reasonable time frame.  They are a great stock for the next 2-5 years which I have invested what measly bits I can afford for this reason.  

Astra is another one, but is the opposite of RL, where RL has growth potential Astra has quick earnings potential.  RL has steady ability to send special cargo to specific orbits on your timeline for a higher price (later to send up constellation sats on a non-SpaceX, non-foreign launcher) than a ride share program, Astra is basically the cheapest quickest ways to get to orbit.

Astra uses the cheapest materials and technology to get to orbit with small payloads, RL uses the most advanced technology to send whatever will be the market demands in the future (trailing demand).

Astra will be winning contracts I believe (NASA shortly) and is liked by DOD because it can launch very quickly for cheap price (basically it an ICBM on a truck) where as RL has won launches from NASA by being able to handle scientific equipment and handle expensive long distance missions with their kickstage.

I haven't see any of that from Ark.  Honestly I haven't seen anything from Ark but Wallstreet information and promises, and the people from Wallstreet seem to have a record of falling through.  To me it seems like Ark is the first that will probably poison the well for investors to space because it will promise the moon and barely deliver.  What they want is SpaceX and without any knowledge of actual companies of rockety they are fleeced.  

And that is not new in the world of rocketry, it happens all the time where investors get sold a new company that make launches if they just invest their money, they just need more money to get it off the ground, just so more money.  Even Elon thought their company would fail because rockets are hard, even with former NASA people on his team.  I don't think WS will have the stomach for bleeding cashflow that will be required for Ark to be competitive compared to a solid business like RL or Astra who only need the money for R&D for next generation of rockets."

The thing is you can't downplay is the fact that Cathie Wood lives and breathes this shit. She could be wrong but her odds are much better than most of us.

03/30/2021,stocks,"To be clear:

I'm a big fan of any ETF staying true to their actual purpose or at least general investment ethos. Here, the ethos seems to be wacky.

In case of an inflationary hedge, why not use short term money funds or similar ""safe positions"", if you want to call them safe, of course. Safer than cash, let's say in case you expect inflation surging. 

So, yes, I'm aware it might be better to use NFLX in terms of (short term) monetary appreciation - but also: who knows in this crazy valuated market with strange single stock movements flaring up everywhere (and tech broadly tanking), with super high current P/E's over 25-30 and high forward P/Es north of 50? 

NFLX current P/E 80 (!), fwd P/E > 50! 

So: Who says NFLX can't and won't tank to a current P/E of, say 45.3 and a fwd P/E of more reasonable 21.8, soon? I know it's only 1.2 % of stated holdings currently. That does not make the question or train of thought invalid, though. 

Aside the actual crazyness from ""ARK says NFLX is Space Stonks"", obviously."

Well I can't say that I knew much if anything about them before you asked, however I can say I know these points of information on a trend-line if these things continue.

* SpaceX's Starship whose development I follow will within a year or two be capable of launching millions of tons into LEO very cheaply each year
* NASA is now planning on doing a solicitation for designs for a new space station https://futurism.com/the-byte/nasa-offers-400-million-companies-build-new-space-stations?fbclid=IwAR3w6LUy1mKL6v-lGpAyRAOdrrCmB-dHqvUL_h_6IN2J7eXYk6dsJWcd0J8
* NASA's new space station is planned to be built using private-public partnerships like it has done with the previous COTS/Crew/Lunar programs (selecting winners and providing awards)
* SpaceX plans to send its colonists to Mars with 3d printers and harvest resources to save weight to build the colonies

From what I can see RedWire would fill that gap, SpaceX aims to be more the railroad and telephone company in this scenario rather than trying to be everything.  Redwire would be filling that gap with their technology that would work well with a partnership with both SpaceX, NASA, and other space companies when working in space.

I do not know anything about their fundamental technology or about leadership or their finances, only that their goal of their company is at least aiming for a necessary open marketplace in the future should these key points continue to stay open as well.  Should NASA get a change in direction and SpaceX have to go alone, should SpaceX have to fight tooth and nail with the FAA for every launch making their prototype testing a serious hassle, then that could change.

I would say try to find 3rd printing board and some experts if they have any opinion on the company or something along those lines.  Typically you can get a feel for companies baselines from field experts."

Their focus is on doing things in space, deep space, which is exactly where the government and private can make money right now, not in launching which is very niche with SpaceX domination (which you have my writeup on already).

So I was slightly off with the 3d printing thing, they may go that route, but they are 100% going to be bidding on that new NASA space station and have experience doing so.  I don't know if they are worth the $10 it is now (I have a feeling it may drop below after merger unless a deal were to be announced).

However, they are in a great position for the commercialization of space with space tugs, stations, and transit in between (docking, maintenance, human activity, etc) there are lots of parts their companies they merged with make and can make as part of contracts.

The main sticking point is, is it worth $10 a share?

It absolutely is logical to accept ""not god"", because a lack of evidence against an something doesn't make the inverse of it more valid. We don't say god == true because we can't say god == false.

I think it is a valid for them to have that plan, but assuming everyone else shares same context and goals, and needs to follow the variety plan as the one true path seems to be the fault here.

Berkshire Hathaway being very much experienced and much more diligent in their DD has a different goals and plans than the commenter, and commenter should have either asked for general goals and plans for the portfolio before throwing their own opinion on things. It speaks more to the lack of maturity for the commenter than anything else. This being the internet, that checks out."

03/30/2021,stocks,"To be fair I do think Berkshire needed more REITs in their investment portfolio. They're long term holdings, they operate on value spreads, they have a virtually infinite growth trajectory, and most feature zero exploitation (maybe he dislikes that). People like Store Capital in part because of their strict accounting and traditional value investing focus, along with their lovely CEO speaking with the public, but lots of REITs do this by nature. Equity REITs pretty much have to value invest in order to have any real shareholder return.

There's an interview where he discusses why he never went that route, but personally I think he would have done very well in real estate. It's much less opaque than insurance.

Edit: had to add this. Realty Income's total returns since IPO in the early 90s far surpasses BRK.B's returns in the same period. ""Ew, REITs make you pay taxes for them, Berkshire is tax efficient."" Well, the total return was double. Food for thought."

03/30/2021,stocks,"People often forget that rising yields often meant cyclical and growth stocks are where you want to be, not value.

I'm not an expert but as far as I understand it is the **RATE OF CHANGE** on the 10 year yield that spooked the market, not really the change itself. The yield hit 1% in early January and the market expected it to keep climbing as the economy recovered. However, nobody expected it to move as quickly as it did. The move from 1.0% up to 1.5% and now 1.72% could be called a dislocation. Many people expected this move but assumed it would come much later in the year or maybe next year.

03/30/2021,stocks,Does seem to be cooling off. A month ago these kinds of yield moves would have had tech down much more in PM.
03/30/2021,stocks,"Right. The higher it goes, the less and less effect it'll have on pricing. 

Part of the terminal value calculation is 1/(d-r). More specifically, PE is proportional to this term. 

If d (discount rate) and r (long term growth rate) are the same, the equation will approach infinity. This obviously won't happen, but when they're close together, the curve is very steep (when you plot it out). On the steep side of the curve, any incremental change to the discount rate, d, will have a big effect, moving you up or down that curve. This is especially true for growth companies because r is larger compared to 'value', making the (d-r) term smaller, and thus further up the steep part of the curve.  

Conversely, as d grows, the curve starts to flatten. At this point, incremental changes to d have less of an effect. 

This generally explains why growth has been hit harder than 'value'. The real world is obviously a little messier than a simple terminal value calc, but it gives us a general picture of how we can expect this to play out. 

So your feeling is correct, the move from 1% to 2% will have a bigger effect than from 2-3%, and so on until changes in interest rate only have a marginal impact on valuation."

03/30/2021,stocks,Growth stocks with no cash flow of their own and negative earnings rely on the extension of credit and investment inorder to continue to operate. When the Fed lowered the rates back in March many investors readjusted their discount rates when calculating it's value to reflect the drop. Now that loans are more expensive to borrow it cuts into their bottom lines since more of their future profits will go towards paying interest.

As a global play I hypothesize that developing countries will be on the rise in the next 5-10 years. I'm reluctant to do China and most of southeast asia due to heavy influence of politics, but India seems to geographically, and mentally, be positioned for best growth in the future. I want to avoid ETFs and also non-US listed companies as I think US regulation is beneficial to transparency and hopefully helps keep companies straight, at least to a point). Motivated by this thinking i took up finviz with a basic filter of India based companies, sorted by market cap, and then further looked into how the charts, analyst recommendations and social media sentiment looks. 

I landed on these three tickers, sorted into a convenient screener for whoever is interested in discussing on this post:

I'll probably do a bit of basic fundamental analysis later but I thought there might be people here who are way ahead of me.

2021-03-30 09:47:04,stocks,"Tesla and Toyota Are Considering Jointly Developing a Small Electric SUV Platform Choi Won-seok reports in the Korean Ghosun Libo news publication that according to an official from the Japanese automotive industry Toyota and Tesla have been reviewing the partnership since last year and are approaching the final stage.

Here are some of the highlights of Toyota Tesla partnership. When the partnership with Toyota is established, Tesla will be able to launch a compact SUV EV at low cost using the Toyota platform.

The Ghosun IIbo is the biggest newspaper in SK. A Tesla source Sawyer Merritt, tweets that he has been told ""the reporter of the story is also highly regarded. We'll see if it's true.""

Toyota provides the vehicle platform to Tesla, and instead, Tesla provides some of the electronic control platform and software technology installed in its vehicle to Toyota.

When the partnership with Toyota is established, Tesla will be able to launch a compact SUV electric vehicle at low cost using the Toyota platform. In addition, Tesla's sales in Japan, which are around 1,000 units per year, are likely to increase significantly.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk said at the 'Battery Day' in September of last year, that Tesla ""will release a $25,000 compact and affordable electric car in 2023. However, among experts, there were several opinions that it would be difficult for Tesla to find a way to sell electric cars at such low prices. Especially considering Tesla has already developed the Model 3 in 2017, The model electric crossover in 2020, the exoskeleton of the Cybertruck and working on the Semi truck. at this moment we have no idea about Tesla's affordable compact vehicle, which now it looks like may be produced in partnership with Toyota, if this report is true.

I think this is a smart move for both Tesla and Toyota. Some people may be skeptical of a Tesla Toyota partnership, but remember that Tesla helped built Toyota RAV4 in 2012. I am sure you guys remember when Toyota sold its Tesla stocks in 2017.

&#x200B;

**What's in it for Toyota?**

Toyota can also significantly reduce the resources and time spent on innovation of its vehicle's integrated electronic control platform ( ECU ) and operating system ( OS ) by using Tesla technology. Toyota is evaluating that the integrated ECU and OS technology that can control and improve vehicle functions through wireless updates (Over The Air) is lagging behind Tesla. In other words, through cooperation between the two companies, Tesla can reduce the cost and period of developing small electric SUVs and Toyota's benefit is the gain in ECU and OS development. It aims for a win-win effect by reducing the time it takes for the two companies to compensate for each other's weaknesses, allowing them to focus more on their own strengths.

&#x200B;

Tesla and Toyota have previously partnered. The two companies agreed to jointly develop electric vehicles in 2010, and in 2012 marketed Toyota's RAV4 electric vehicle equipped with Tesla's battery system. However, due to various reasons such as poor sales, the alliance between the Toyota and Tesla ended in 2017. Yet, the close relationship between Musk and Toyota CEO Akio Toyoda was maintained, leaving room for a reunion between the two companies in the future.

&#x200B;

Tesla's Fremont Factory is an automobile manufacturing plant in Fremont, California, operated by Tesla. But the facility opened as the General Motors Fremont Assembly in 1962, and was later operated by NUMMI, a former GM–Toyota joint venture. Tesla took ownership in 2010.

&#x200B;

Last year, Toyota sold 9.35 million vehicles, surpassing Volkswagen and returned to the world's top sales in five years. Toyota, along with Isuzu and its truck subsidiary Hino, plans to accelerate the electric and autonomous driving of commercial vehicles. Prior to this, Toyota also established a hydrogen fuel cell development joint venture with five Chinese automobile and technology companies, including Tsinghua University, Beijing, Cheil, Dongfeng, and Guangzhou Motors. The jointly developed hydrogen fuel cell system will be installed on Chinese trucks and buses from 2022. In addition, Toyota is striving to maximize economies of scale related to electrification and autonomous driving, including successive capital alliances with rivals Mazda and Suzuki.

&#x200B;

Meanwhile, Tesla CEO Elon Musk wrote on Twitter on the 27th of March that “the likelihood that Tesla will soon become the largest company in the world is higher than 0%.” Although the context is not clear, it was also written “probably within a few months,” an expression that can be interpreted as referring to a period, and was soon deleted. Currently, Tesla's market capitalization is about $ 590 billion, which is one-third of the world's largest market capitalization company, Apple.

&#x200B;

Tesla's share price continued to rise even after surpassing Toyota, which was the first in the industry's market capitalization at the time, in July of last year. Tesla, in particular, has a task to achieve economies of scale, with only 500,000 vehicles sold as of last year. If the alliance with Toyota is established, it can receive great power to expand mass production faster and at lower cost.

03/30/2021,stocks,"It seems fairly odd that only a Korean reporter finds out this. Searched the news in Japanese, and found no such thing."
03/30/2021,stocks,"I'm sceptical. This is at odds with both company's positions for the last several years.

Toyota has loudly stated that their primary path is hybrid ICE/EV towards a final goal of Hydrogen fuel cells. There was a presentation came out about 18months/2 years ago on it, and there's been nothing released that I've seen contradicting that plan (until this rumour). Furthermore Mr Toyoda has been publicly dismissive of Tesla, it would be very culturally odd for a Japanese ~~CEO~~ President (Edit wrong title) to step away from those unusually strong words and back into partnership.

Similarly this isn't congruent with Tesla's stated plans (although they are far more likely to do an abrupt change than Toyota). They have stated they're happy to sell their skateboard when they have spare capacity (ie production capability exceeds demand), but they've also made it very clear that their primary focus in the car space is the ""machine that builds the machine"" (in Musk's words) - that is they're focussed on developing their ability to build their gigafactories and the optimisation of the build cycle (the single piece casting of entire subframes etc ""giga press"" as they call it) and FSD. Trying to get a partner up to speed on their software platforms is going to divert a lot of resources away from their core goals and isn't in line with the way Musk has behaved for the last 5 years across all his companies.

If Tesla were looking for a Japanese partner to crack into that space, wouldn't a smaller player like Honda or Subaru be a more logical choice than a company that has been very negative about their previous experience with them ?"

03/30/2021,stocks,"As a massive tesla bull I was (still am) a bit hesitant when I heard the rumor, and again let's be clear this is still only a rumor. One of Elon's goals was 'the machine that builds the machine' allowing them to manufacture vehicles more efficiently than the legacy competition, so a partnership using Toyota's manufacturing seems out of line for Elon. Toyota does have everything they need to mass produce vehicles and ramp up production which is currently Tesla's biggest hurdle, so it does make sense in that regard. I do see how tesla licensing their software could be beneficial though, \*especially\* for autonomy, because the more cars on roads using teslas technology the more data they're collecting for their autonomy program, which would further propel them into the lead, and most Tesla bulls agree that autonomy is their biggest growth driver.

It'll be interesting to watch non the less and I'm excited to see if it is officially announced or if it's all just rumor."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Ugh.

This goes to show two things:

1) Volkswagen really is the Next Tesla and Tesla is trying to fend it off.

2) Toyota is soooooo behind amongst the legacy automakers, and is desperate.  Rather than break off the partnership after the poor sales of the RAV4 EV, they should have doubled down."

03/30/2021,stocks,Most likely to assist in the current inflation of TSLA’s price. The market is in turmoil and I don’t believe that they want to be the ones liquidated.
03/30/2021,stocks,"It's bs. Toyota would be the last one to innovate, they halted any innovation years ago."
03/30/2021,stocks,"I think Toyota is the perfect partner for Tesla. I am not as familiar with their Rav4 venture in 2012, but just by taking lean classes and being force fed the Toyota Way, it seems like the culture at that company is ripe for innovation and success. When Toyota decides to do something new, it doesn't make its decision haphazardly.

The other thing is the culture within Toyota is focused on learning and not letting preconceived notions hinder decision making. If Toyoda-san was dismissive in the past, the time between then and now must have shown him some promise that he missed from his last impression.

I'm not an auto industry expert, but just based off of what I was forced to learn about Toyota's history, I am willing to place my chips on this bet, hands down."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Don't be skeptical. This will be even better than my favorite automaker mashup, which is the Chrysler TC by Maserati."
03/30/2021,stocks,"> Toyota has loudly stated that their primary path is hybrid ICE/EV towards a final goal of Hydrogen fuel cells.

This news may represent a pivot on that stance.

One major thing people forget about with Hydrogen is refueling.  No one is going to buy a Hydrogen fueled car if they can't refuel it.  And, gas stations aren't going to start carrying Hydrogen unless there's a market for it.  It's a chicken and egg problem that acts as a *MASSIVE* barrier to entry.

At the same time, the world is committing to BEV technology.  China sold 1.3M BEVs in 2020 and Europe is projecting 1M in 2021.  The E.U., China, and U.S. are all committing resources at the federal level.  VW just planted their flag with Power Day 2 weeks ago.  Massive investments have been made into battery factories all over the world.

Hydrogen Fuel is simply too far behind.  By the time they have a viable product, BEV technology will have already achieved an unassailable market share.  Toyota sees the writing on the wall."
03/30/2021,stocks,"So do I. Toyota has shown little to no interest in EVs, preferring to stick to hybrids and their ridiculous hydrogen pet projects. Consequently, it has lost a lot of competitive advantage that it could have had thanks to the popularity of the Prius. I don't see Toyota as a flexible company that pivots well. It seems devoted to ICE vehicles at a time when most manufacturers are exploring EVs."
03/30/2021,stocks,I think this is how toyota started out in the car market...or maybe it was honda or nissan. They frankensteined cars from a mix of other manufacturers {chevy/ford} and created a 'new' car.
03/30/2021,stocks,"Why? They have done it in the past with Toyota Rav4 EV, why not again?"
03/30/2021,stocks,What would we do without journalists to tell us things?
03/30/2021,stocks,Most likely something got lost in translation to English
03/30/2021,stocks,"Yeah but I can’t see Toyota working with Tesla for long, toyota’s workflow and attention to detail would go against everything Tesla makes. There been plenty of times companies worked with Toyota but relationships collapsed due to Toyota focus on reliability."

03/30/2021,stocks,"It's really sad to me just how far Toyota has fallen since the Prius. Toyota literally had the branding right there to make a very successful BEV if they had just gone the next logical step. But instead they stood still and let Tesla come along to surpass them.

It's no coincidence that Toyota of America blamed Tesla and disloyal Prius owners [for half of their 9% customer defection rate](https://electrek.co/2019/01/28/tesla-responsible-half-toyota-owner-defection-rate/). Their Prius customers were environmentalists who wanted a BEV and were willing to pay more for it, but Toyota refused to give it to them, so they went elsewhere.

If Toyota had been serious about the BEV market like Tesla there's no way Tesla should have stood a chance against them, especially in the early days when they were struggling a lot more for cash."

03/30/2021,stocks,"Ford has their hybrid now. I think the electric one is coming out this year, don’t quote me on that"
03/30/2021,stocks,"Ford almost certainly doesn't have licenced Tesla tech, there are reviews that make it quite clear how far behind it is. (Although it's not a bad first effort, it's got a ways to go yet)."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Toyota will probably be buying cheap drivetrain systems from BYD and entering Chinese market with BEVs in next couple years, global market in 3-5 once tech is up to snuff. They were first movers on hybrid, decided to be more cautious and deliberate with the low/no margin EV rollout. I think they miscalculated a bit in terms of how quickly people would adopt, but you can be sure they have a revised plan now. 

That said, I think VWs valuation is about 35-50% of Toyota's, and it has the better 5-10 year roadmap, so VW def seems the better positioned & better buy of the two. 

I don't see this move from Toyota..."
03/30/2021,stocks,"If VW is the next Tesla, the ID3 and 4 are certainly not demonstrating that. Have you seen how many steps are involved in charging an ID with the VW charging network?

That being said, VW is almost certainly going to be an EV powerhouse. But Tesla, GM, and VW alone aren't going to be able to replace all legacy autos. There is plenty of room, and too many legacy auto companies still don't give half a crap."
03/30/2021,stocks,"VW up 12% today because the market loves cheesy announcements and ""Voltswagen"" is by far the cheesiest thing possible."
03/30/2021,stocks,The RAV4 Prime is selling slow because they’re having trouble sourcing materials for their new batteries. But they have huge demand. If Toyota didn’t have these supply chain issues it would be the best selling ‘EV’.
03/30/2021,stocks,"Tm has problems with battery, look at how many rav4 prime produces last year and guidance for this year.

And it’s not due to demand, some people are buying $5-$20k over msrp"
03/30/2021,stocks,"Knowledge. Strategic partnerships often turn into a learning race, with the winner being the better student. Toyota stands to learn the most from this partnership given asymmetric language barriers (and thus, asymmetric transparency in knowledge sharing) and an inequivalent exchange of product/process expertise. While easier to appropriate the ""platform"" from Toyota, Tesla is potentially giving away the more proprietary, and costlier to obtain, knowledge in tech/R&D."
03/30/2021,stocks,The software side is where the margins are. So if they put Teslas software in a ton more cars that will just bring in huge profits for Tesla. Dumb move by Toyota if you ask me
03/30/2021,stocks,"That will be the end of the Tesla Story, though: it buys out one or more legacy automakers."
03/30/2021,stocks,More like 125Bn

03/30/2021,stocks,"I think it's the other way around, all the issues Tesla had with project management, reliability, and, service could massively benefit from the institutional knowledge, economies of scale etc. The mainstream market will be a lot more competitive than the boutique cars too"
03/30/2021,stocks,Toyota could teach Telsa how to build a car properly and efficiently. Telsa takes too long to build them for how terrible the fit and finish is and Toyota has basically written the book on car manufacturing efficiency.

Toyota getting help with infotainment software, OTA upgrades, and battery management, while Tesla getting help with the silly manufacturing mistakes slowing them down and tarnishing their reputation, sounds like the best of all worlds for both parties. Toyota makes like 20x more cars and I'd wager with less manufacturing problems as a total let alone as a percent, but their infotainment and upgrade process stinks."

You’re very misinformed. The market is getting more saturated by the day. By 2025, there will be an insane number of EVs in the marketplace. TSLA is already slowing down its growth in the face of VW, Ford, GM, Lucid, and Nio. Mercedes, Freightliner, and Volvo are just a few more that will zap more of their business. 

> Plus Tesla has a few AWS-like revenue streams in development. They only need like 1-2 of them to succeed to be worth over 1-2 trillion.

> The fact that most people don't know about Tesla's non car software potential makes Tesla an easy hold for me. Their physical car business is going to be tiny compared to everything else by 2030.

But who are the competitors? What is the marketplace? Will TSLA make and market better chips than NVDA? Will they make better software than AAPL? Will their autonomous driving platform not backfire without the use of redundant sensors? What are the legislative and regulatory hurdles?

There’s so much to consider that it’s not 1+1=2. It’s a promising company with a good future that is currently way overvalued and does not remotely deserve a $3T valuation in 2025. That’s complete nonsense and just garbage numbers ARK created to pump the stock."

03/30/2021,stocks,"TSLA is a very forward looking stock. So its price now is reflective of what people expect years from now. So a lot of future stuff is “baked in”. 

Considering this, it’s not entirely unreasonable that 2025 price will reflect expectations of 2027-2030. And if people expect that a lot of those promises to come true, then I could see a 3T valuation by then. But really, any stock predictions by 2025 are just that. Not something to really take too seriously."

Just to be clear even though it wasn’t the case with my car I don’t disagree Tesla quality hasn’t been an issue especially on the first model year releases as plenty of people have had had issue but the current status of their manufacturing is on par with if not better than their peers.  The die cast system will be a game changer with regards to build quality that all other autos will have to copy to match.

>Portfolio will add two Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and a plug-in hybrid (PHEV)

Plug in hybrid means they are dragging their feet on EV, which is fine if you just want to make money on ICE cars. And make use of the hybrid tech they already have.  

BEV and PHEV having the same environmental benefits is not a good thing. It means the BEV is subpar. Why doesn't the BEV have higher environmental benefits. How is the BEV on par with a car that burns gas. It sounds like their tech is behind.

I'm not saying they can't make a good car, but they will be lagging behind for years to come for sure. And being a power house car maker in the EV space isn't guaranteed to anyone."

The panel gap issues were mostly from <2017, its very rare to see that problem these days, and if you've ever bought an american made car from Ford/GM etc then its kinda par for the course, american car manufacturing isnt the best, and one of the reasons why Tesla is going with die cast to ensure fit and finish is near impossible to screw up.

One of my vehicles cost more than double what your model 3 cost, and the other was about the same price...so I don’t think cost is the issue...and you’re the one that linked the article my guy. 

Face it, you’re on your knees for daddy Elon. Hold them accountable for their shortcomings and maybe he’ll fix them for you. As for now, they should continue outsourcing as much of their car as they can. The battery systems are the best thing about them, and Panasonic is the brains behind those.

The Toyota ""partnership"" is Toyota's cry for help from Tesla before they go out of business which will happen quickly if they dont pivot like VW is."

You missed my point. Tesla makes a ton of stuff for their cars, but most of those things are lacking in quality. JD Power found 205 initial issues per 100 vehicles in their 2020 initial quality study, more than any other vehicle. Even daddy Elon has acknowledged these issues. It’s hilarious that you can’t.

Ev’s are absolutely the future. No arguments from me there. 

Toyota definitely isn’t begging for help from Tesla lol. Toyota has 10x the revenue of Tesla, and had something like 18bn in profits in 2020, Tesla did 720m. It’s not even close. 

Do you realize how well Toyota is positioned in the car world? They sell more vehicles than anyone except Volkswagen, they rank second in reliability overall, they have one of the longest lifespans and they just make good cars in general. Nothing flashy, nothing super innovative...just good, proven tech installed properly and finished professionally...and then you have Lexus, which shits on all other luxury manufacturers pretty much every year.

Toyota is probably going to release a fully electric SUV in the US this year. It’s sales will decimate any vehicle Tesla makes, and might even sell more of that 1 model than Tesla sells total. Hell, they almost already sell more rav 4’s than Tesla sells total vehicles 😂"
03/30/2021,stocks,"Yeah heard that before....The Nissan, Volvo, Voltzwagon, Ford, GM new electric cars will ""decimate"" Tesla sales, Leaf, Volt, Bolt, ID3, Tycan, Mustang all failing, still waiting for that decimation.....dont get me wrong i'd love to see a real competitor to Tesla in the EV space but until competitors start focusing on range(battery tech and efficiency) their sales will suffer.  You dont get how hard it is for them to convert over to EVs, battery costs make EVS highly unprofitable for everyone but Tesla as they locked in the lowest battery costs long ago(with many vendors like panasonic) and design/make their own as well.  And with Tesla's revolutionary die cast technology about to be deployed their quality will lead as well at a cost no one will be able to compete with....VW may survive as they understand the end is coming if they dont adapt but many market leaders wont be around in 10 years if they dont follow Tesla's lead, though i think it may be too late.  And I never said quality issues werent an issue as producing cars isnt easy(there is a reason there hasnt been a new car company in several decades), but the improvements they've made are exponential and is a focus of the company...every field failure is fed back to the factory immediately and optimization are made to reduce them faster than any other car company could dream of.  Thus you see dramatic quality improvements over time(and why its not a good idea to buy a Tesla in the first year of a model)"
03/30/2021,stocks,"This is really hurting me. Do you not realize how small time Tesla is? They sold 500,000 cars in 2020...Toyota sold 9.5 million. They made $720 million dollars...Toyota made 18 BILLION. It’s not even close.

Think about it this way...Tesla has been #1 in the EV market for how long? Since 2012? They haven’t made any money doing so until 2020, and that had a lot to do with tax credits. That’s not good man. 

I can absolutely appreciate the work they’ve done and the advancement they’ve made in ev tech and manufacturing...but that die casting machine? Yeah Toyota solved that problem eons ago without having to have idra build them the worlds largest casting machine. They already have the robots to assemble everything, they already have the lines to do all of this...all they have to do is integrate the EV tech. Obviously this isn’t as easy as I make it sound...but it’s a lot easier than integrating everything EXCEPT the ev tech that it takes to build 9 million cars per year.

I can absolutely guarantee you that Toyota will go nowhere in our lifetimes. Their future is much more certain than Tesla’s."

And you are very correct that its very very hard to make EVs at a profit, and no one besides Tesla is working on that and clearly have solved that problem through battery and build(die cast) engineering....its not that the other EVs are that bad, its just when Ford/GM/VW/Nissan see they are losing money on each EV they make, they claim 'lack of batteries' etc and turn the line back over to SUVs.  Honestly it's game-set-match, and i really dont see Toyota taking this challenge seriously like VW is trying to, this is going to go down much like that time Godzilla visited Japan....but maybe this ""partnership"" will save them, as Elons goal from the beginning was to force the car companies to convert to EVs not crush them, once they take it seriously i expect him to merge or sell out to the winner."

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/abcellera-reports-full-2020-business-200500028.html

**ABOUT THE COMPANY**

Ticker : $ABCL

Price : $23.29 ( At close, 29th) ; $27.70 (After Hours) 

Market Cap : $6.29 Billion


$ABCL (AbCellera Biologics Inc) best known for specializing in antibody discovery and partnering up with Eli Lilly and Co. ($LLY) on a COVID-19 treatment, raised US$555 million through a blockbuster initial public offering in December 2020. 

AbCellera is a technology company that searches, decodes, and analyzes natural immune systems to find antibodies that its partners can develop into drugs to prevent and treat disease. AbCellera partners with drug developers of all sizes, from large pharmaceutical to small biotechnology companies, empowering them to move quickly, reduce cost, and tackle the toughest problems in drug development.

Abcellera did better than most of it's fellow bio technology competitors by bursting out of the gate two years ago with a $30 million grant from the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency under its Pandemic Prevention Platform to adapt and pressure test the company’s platform for responding to a real-world pandemic in less than 55 days. Caught up in a real pandemic in May 2020, Ottawa unzipped CA$175.6 million (US$124.7 million) to support Abcellera's discovery of antibodies for use in drugs to treat COVID-19.


**PETER THIEL JOINS AS A BOARD OF DIRECTOR AT ABCELLERA**

https://calgaryherald.com/pmn/press-releases-pmn/business-wire-news-releases-pmn/peter-thiel-joins-abcelleras-board-of-directors

“AbCellera is executing a long-term plan to make biotech move faster. I am proud to help them as they raise our expectations of what’s possible,” said Mr. Thiel.

I Trust this man too much! This is primarily the main reason I have invested in this company! My first 300% was because of this man on $PLTR! 


**COLLABORATION WITH ELI LILLY ($LLY) TO CREATE BAMLANIVIMAB (COVID-19 ANTI-BODY)**

https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-monoclonal-antibody-treatment-covid-19

Bamlanivimab (INN, codenamed LY-CoV555) is a monoclonal antibody developed by AbCellera Biologics and Eli Lilly as a treatment for COVID-19.

The drug is an IgG1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. The aim is to block viral attachment and entry into human cells, thus neutralizing the virus, and help preventing and treating COVID-19. 


**SUCCESS OF BAMLANIVIMAB**

Lilly announces agreement with U.S. government to supply 300,000 vials of investigational neutralizing antibody bamlanivimab (LY-CoV555) in an effort to fight COVID-19 

https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-announces-agreement-us-government-supply-300000-vials

Lilly to supply 650,000 more doses of COVID-19 drug to U.S. government

https://www.google.com/amp/s/mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKBN28C3AO

The Biden administration buys 100,000 doses of a combination antibody treatment for high-risk Covid-19 patients.

(The U.S. government previously agreed to buy nearly 1.5 million doses of bamlanivimab alone. Eli Lilly has delivered more than 1 million doses already, with the remainder to be delivered by the end of March. More than 660,000 doses of bamlanivimab have been shipped out to states and other jurisdictions.)

I guess the only thing that concerns me - how much of their revenue is coming from Covid related work, and what’s their future revenue based around?"
03/30/2021,stocks,"Can you explain why the company has dropped 60% since going public only 4 months ago? If they did so well in the past year, what's with this? Seems pretty sus to me."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Partnerships and lifetime royalties. They acknowledge the bmav rev being the vast majority of what they’re pulling in at the moment but due to the projected endemics of Covid bmav and 1404 will likely continue to generate money. Also various undisclosed project in a wide range of therapies they aren’t willing to share at this time. 800 mil on hand, very little debt and most(maybe all) is owed to the government of Canada at 0% interest"
03/30/2021,stocks,"Keep in mind that they went public at 20$/share. The IPO market had been red hot and they immediately started trading in the 50-60 range.

Also the earnings report was a bit mixed too. Revenue was about 10% higher than expected, but EPS was 45c vs 60c expected."
03/30/2021,stocks,"I have no clue! That's also the reason why I invested here. At all time lows, looked up the company, read through their filings found no reason for the drop. Its absurd! The IPO share lock up is till June 8th, so not insider selling. Maybe, institutions selling, nopppee! Almost all of the hedge funds and institutions bought above $35.

So, it's either a rebalancing by an institution to get rid of their over leverage OR Heavy short attacks. I honestly don't know.

I found out that Peter Thiel had invested and the risk - reward ratio was pretty good in my favour and hence put in some money. That's my reasoning."

03/30/2021,stocks,"It’s that total. However, it also depends on how long you keep day trading it. Just because you sold it on 12/31 it doesn’t register as a loss if you buy it back in January. You buy your loss back and it does NOT count towards prior year taxes. In fact it looks like you had a bigger gain. A lot of folks expect that anything closed as of 12/31 is in prior year tax only to realize folks buy back their losses in the coming year. That’s why 1099bs are not given to you in January.

2021-03-30 08:43:57,stocks,"Help with rebalancing I’m a young investor with a small portfolio, mostly in AMZN and GOOGL. Lately I have been adding up value and dividend stocks to my tech-heavy portfolio and it has worked better than I expected. But there is a limitation to it due to those two taking up such a sizable chunk of my capital. GOOGL actually is up 17% while AMZN is down 5%. If I sold both now, I would have about 6-7% in realized gains. Which isn’t bad but not sure if it would still beat the gains I would make from value/dividend stocks. 

My goal is to load up on value stocks I already own to make enough dividends. With tech stocks these days, I just don’t see if they can maintain their growth trend this year. 

I probably wouldn’t have to worry about this if my brokerage had fractional shares, but it doesn’t unfortunately. And it’s the only one I found to actually work here in China. I am a US citizen btw.

I know I have many years ahead in the horizon, but if I could build my portfolio in the right direction, I would rather do it now than wait for what’s going to happen in the future. Don’t get me wrong, I have stayed more patient than I have ever been with the market, as naive and funny as it may sound for a novice investor. The only time I sold some of my stocks was when the GME frenzy happened and even then I quickly realized how dumb it is to be controlled by emotions. So I’m not selling anything for now.

But now there is an actual issue with maintaining an imbalanced portfolio that prevents me from executing my strategy, I am debating whether I should allow myself to take the risk. Maybe it’s more risky to hold onto them Idk."

I would do some more dd on GOOGL and AMZN as well before you decide to sell, both are wonderful companies that have monster growth numbers. Not to mention growth stocks are more tax advantagous than dividend stocks"
03/30/2021,stocks,Do not sell AMZN and GOOGL. Thank me later.
03/30/2021,stocks,Rebalancing is a scam
03/30/2021,stocks,"Stock Market 101 rule, if you sell, it will go up. If you buy, it will go down.

Value kicks ass, but requires you to pick better and DD. Blue chips are safer and easier but slower. 
Penny stocks and SPACs are too speculative to hold value during bear markets."

2021-03-30 08:04:02,stocks,"Upcoming Inflation? Some people are starting to say they see a post-pandemic inflationary run coming? How realistic do you think that is? How would you respond? 

My understanding is that for normal inflation protection many would tend to move toward commodities (metals, ore, wood). I think that maybe covers you from the government debt side of the house but I don’t know if that works here for overall supply drops (companies failing) and demand increases (pent up demand). 

Thoughts? 

(Talking from a US perspective here, but all opinions welcome! ☺️)

Edit: I know that ABSOLUTELY NO ONE knows where anything is going, but if you had the feeling inflation was coming what would you do?"
03/30/2021,stocks,"Avocados went from $0.74 to a $1 in the past week at my local grocery store. So I'd say InFLaTIoN is already here.

/s, just to be safe"
03/30/2021,stocks,"For me, I feel like I’m missing some crucial understanding, but if the value of the dollar were to go down, that doesn’t really effect what I’m doing in the market.  I see so much selling off based on the assumption that “inflation is coming” (I actually don’t think this dip is being caused by that anyway), which doesn’t make sense to me.  If the value of your money is supposed to go down, how does parking it somewhere to just depreciate with no gains better than letting it make money in the market, even if you technically “make less”?  

For me, my strategy hasn’t changed.  I’ll just keep making money doing the wheel and if the value of my money decreases, then oh well.  If it doesn’t, great.  Either way, my goal is just to increase my overall account."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Waters pretty safe, maybe?

Not even advice"

03/30/2021,stocks,"CPI numbers are extremely flawed as they leave out energy, financial assets and real estate. You are correct in your assumptions about inflation but i would argue that it’s already here. I think that those that have not already moved parts of their portfolio to commodities will have to play catch-up pretty soon."
03/30/2021,stocks,Houses and lots...whore houses and lots of whiskey.
03/30/2021,stocks,"Most recent NPR's Planet Money discussed this at question 16.20 minutes .. inflation specifically 19m onwards. The Brandeis professor (Steve Cecchetti) who wrote an economics textbook said inflation comes when 1) people think there is going to be inflation (19.30), 2) aggregate demand increase overheating the economy (people buying up a lot more stuff).

MOST IMPORTANT he says that printing more money doesn't lead to more inflation even though he has a whole chapter (20) on it saying it does .. only reason he put that ""abomination"" there was because the editor would not publish without it .. as econ profs had learned that money printing caused inflation that's what they wanted to teach their students! 

So our view of inflation comes from old thinking."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Here is something that is important here. The reason people who are bullish the stock market generally don’t like inflation is usually the reactionary measure to combat inflation is to raise interest rates (and vice versa). We don’t need to go into the nuts and bolts of why, but that is the general assumption. It has to do with consumption/savings behavior from households and firm behavior in how much they can control prices/quantities to maximize profits if you are interested. 

Obviously raising interest rates would be bad for growth companies (who don’t make a lot of money now and/or need to borrow - which is not good in a high rate environment). It would also generally be bad for the market because people will be more likely to save and invest into now higher fixed payment products (pull money from the market). 

However, JPowell isn’t a typical economist. In fact a lot of the people now on or associated with the Fed aren’t typical PhDs. So even if they see some inflation, they might literally not care and still keep rates at 0% or near 0% to stimulate growth, which would be very interesting to see what happens if that is the case."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Inflation will come sooner then later. Us government checks and increased spending (also money printing, which was around 30% money made of the total amount of money in circulation?) by sending massive amounts of money (see covid relief package) will get to everyone at some point. Either it's us or eu it will bite in the ass for everyone when the market is oversaturated by cash. I would bet on metals and paper first for increased prices."
03/30/2021,stocks,"There is a stronger case for deflation that inflation. No one is talking about it. Just like they didn't want to talk about the market correction when I called it out.

The dollar is going up in value, not down. Banks will have to buy investments with their stockpiles of cash (from people's savings sitting there). 

Anyway, inflation or deflation, one strategy is to invest in large cap, consumer staples companies like PG, JNJ, KO, WMT etc. People always need toilet paper and sofa. A lot of those companies give dividends as well.

They aren't very sexy or interesting so they aren't hyped by the retail trader crowd. It's good news. A lot of them are undervalued.

Be careful with gold and silver at the moment. They're tanking. Remains to be seen if that will be a good buying opportunity (same thing with bonds - they're really low and appear to be massively shorted). 

Anything real estate based could be a trainwreck soon. 

Near term, infrastructure stocks are likely to blow up after Biden announces 3 trillion in infra spending on Wednesday.

Look to investing outside of the U.S. economy. It seems likely it the U.S. will lag in recovery and trade compared to other countries. Plus the defecit hasn't been higher ever in history (except during the second world war).

China stocks are at a discount right now. A lot of bigger U.S. investors are taking it as a buying opportunity."
03/30/2021,stocks,"This is why everyone should have 2-10% of their wealth in the most popular digital coin (don't think you're allowed to name it, but you know the one). If heavy inflation comes, it'll do great. If there's no inflation, it is still very likely to do great."
03/30/2021,stocks,They say when velocity of money picks up we are fucked
03/30/2021,stocks,"Fed has zero ability to fight inflation. Raising interest rates would force the US to default on its debts, which permanently crashes bonds. All they can do is try to hide inflation by changing the way they measure it for as long as possible. US is going to experience intense stagflation, just a matter of when."
03/30/2021,stocks,"The thing with inflation is that nobody really gets it. Many factors play a role in driving inflation higher (whether it's higher input costs, increased demand for goods/services, excessive increase in money supply and many more). Anecdotal evidence of higher commodity prices is not necessarily the sign of inflation the Fed wants to see because the pandemic led to a shock on the supply side, which eventually flowed to the demand side. Given the monetary and fiscal stimulus, these prop up the supply side, with the hope that it will eventually flow to the demand side. As a result, real wage growth is more of a focus for inflation as defined by the Fed. Furthermore, this has led to a lot of slack in the economy, which makes it harder for inflation to run hotter than expected.

In terms of strategy, I think the focus should have been on companies that benefit from monetary and fiscal stimulus at the initial step; those would be Infrastructure, Industrials, Energy and Materials. Eventually, when the supply side is propped up, it might be wise to shift to Consumer Staples and Consumer Discretionary (maybe now is the time, as demand starts to pick up and the economy reopens). The reopening stocks seem too crowded for me, as everyone has piled in to those stocks and the valuations aren't attractive to me."
03/30/2021,stocks,"i just don't see it in the near future. it will happen, just not now.

many americans are still staying home and not going out to spend money, so where is this inflation going to come from? more money in the system hasn't really spurred people to spend. it's hard to imagine inflation going beyond the 2% mark for 2021, and that's literally what the fed literally targets.

that being said 2022 could be pretty ugly once things are back to normal AND we're dealing with all the money that got printed."
03/30/2021,stocks,Automobile gas prices are going insane. Buy essentials now that you will need. Stock up on non perishables and other items you use to survive. Back in feb 2020 when I was aware of covid going down in China from reading interet boards I went to walmart looking like a freak buying a closet of canned and long life survival goods. The closet is almost empty and holy crap they came in hand. I traded ramen for toilet paper because I didn't see that one coming but I had a massive ramen collection.
03/30/2021,stocks,"There will be no strong/hyper inflation.

TBH When I moved here I found the cheapest grocery store and don’t look at prices much anymore.  I’m boring so I buy pretty much the exact same thing every week.

03/30/2021,stocks,False

03/30/2021,stocks,Question best directed to Dr. Burry
03/30/2021,stocks,"A housing shortage? Yeah, it’s a total seller’s market. Also, low interest rates have driven up mortgage affordability and inflated housing prices. But that’s not a matter of currency inflation.

The same thing has happened with student loans and college tuition. Also with healthcare.

There are external motivating factors driving these sectors up that aren’t related to currency inflation, which is why they’ve reduced the weight of them when calculating things like CPI.

Timber is incredibly expensive right now, but it’s not inflation causing it, it’s a supply shortage. Graphic cards are incredibly expensive right now, but it’s shortages, trade disputes, and increases in demand."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Inflation is calculated using a basket of different goods for the express purpose of not getting determined too largely by temporary sector-related price increases.

The cause is incredibly relevant. Inflation denotes a general and overall increase in the price of goods and services and inversely the rate at which the value of a currency is falling.

If you have a railroad going into your country that ships 100% of the lettuce and carrots that you import, and that rail line gets damaged, do you say that the cost of salads has increased due to inflation?"

03/30/2021,stocks,"No it isn't.  You're talking about the CPI.  Which purports to measure inflation (although it does not).

And yes, in your envisaged scenario, that price increase is inflation.  It doesn't matter that the cause is scarcity."
03/30/2021,stocks,And to think OP **actually** thought he was here to talk about inflation.
03/30/2021,stocks,"Oh, my mistake, I thought we were talking about measuring inflation based on how professional economists overwhelmingly do it.

Okay, so how do you measure inflation? You just take microeconomic snapshots and use those to determine how much value a currency has lost?

CPI and PPI remain the two most widely used gauges to determine inflation, and they deliberately use an index of goods and services to negate temporary price increases."
03/30/2021,stocks,CPI itself is bullshit.  It's full of bullshit.  And the internet is chock a block with excellent references to cogent criticisms of it.  By economists.
2021-03-30 07:58:24,stocks,Might be time to SELL Lets be real. There are winners and losers. If you hold it doesn’t mean the stock will always come back. I see posts every day here say hold hold hold. But if you are holding a loser stock you need to know when to cut your losses. Selling at a 20% loss is better than selling at a 80% loss. Not all stocks recover.

sell at the lows. 

fuck yeahhhh"
03/30/2021,stocks,"Sure. Obviously. But the problem is people are treating a basket of companies (ETFs of specific sectors) as non risky and solid. 

How many times do people repeat on here not to panic sell their ARK or ICLN. Those funds should absolutely be sold. Interest rate changes, momentum is shot, valuation hasn’t been tied to anything in awhile. 

So yes, hold your solid Apple, Costco, Exxon that are down. That makes sense. Holding stuff that has not made sustained cashflows and went up 200% in a year and is down 40%?  Yeeeaah, that’s time to sell."
03/30/2021,stocks,Agree. If they are solid and have a reasonable valuation
03/30/2021,stocks,I know you're being facetious but maybe when the s&p500 isnt at an all time high is a better time to buy in to certain stocks. Kind of how its pulled back and dipped like 4 times this month for example.
03/30/2021,stocks,Never. If they are meme companies are have ridiculous valuations
03/30/2021,stocks,Better to sell for a ‘small’ loss than hold and the company goes bankrupt. Of course this does not apply to solid companies with reasonable valuations

2021-03-30 07:54:39,stocks,"Advice For Newer Investors / Free Investing Books I don't know if this has been posted recently, but here i go:

Recently I noticed a super high influx of new beginner investors, prolly first because covid freed up some time, and the GME fiasco bought on even more attention. A lot of beginners are asking questions regarding how to manage their money, and questions about building a portfolio. I've seen that a lot of ppl are chasing stocks with a lot of hype rather than doing DD. Gambling is fine but it would be dangerous to think of it as investing. I sympathize with you if that's the case, it's easy and addictive and really gets the endorphins going. When I just first started learning how to invest, I didn't know anything either and got drawn to penny stocks. Luckily I was already broke so I didn't lose a lot of money. Things I find really useful are valuations and contrarianism, but to each their own.

A few months back, there was a [REALLY USEFUL POST](https://www.reddit.com/r/UndervaluedStonks/comments/kheec2/the_ultimate_fundamentals_guide_on_what_you_need/) on [r/UndervaluedStonks](https://www.reddit.com/r/UndervaluedStonks/) with a WHOLE LOT OF VALUABLE information. Please check if out if you haven't It's a literal gold mine.

Secondly, I would like to add additional resources. Investing books have been really helpful in paving the way for me to invest properly, and I'm sure they can be helpful for you too. Personally, I buy them because I want to own a hard copy I can see often and easily and the author deserves the money. However, that is not always convenient, so Here are some links to free popular investing books.

[One Up on Wall Street, By Peter Lynch](https://archive.org/details/one-up-on-wall-street-by-peter-lynch), a very beginner friendly book

[Beating The Street, also by Peter Lynch](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1smsOoYKbk-lnsHDyZFlMiyMP95l0casT/view?usp=sharing), a slightly more nuanced sequel

[One up on wall street, by Philip Fisher](http://www.funtech.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Common-Stocks-and-Uncommon-Profits.pdf), more advanced, a lot of good information on qualitative analysis

[The Intelligent Investor](https://www.e-reading-lib.com/bookreader.php/133361/benjamin-graham-the-intelligent-investor.pdf), The OG, advanced book suggested by Warren Buffet, a more difficult read

Any more additional useful resources would be welcomed in the comments"
03/30/2021,stocks,Best advice is to get VTI and don't get individual stocks unless you are from the future.

03/30/2021,stocks,Great resources. I found all of these recently. Should be pinned on any reddit investing sub.
2021-03-30 07:19:44,stocks,"Technical Analysis/Chart Pattern Reading Reliability & Validity? Just a bit of background, I've been involved in the stock marker for a few yrs now and have had my fair share of making good returns as well as cut losses, using TA & chart patterns as one of the tools to help me make my trading decisions. 

However, I can't seem to shake off the feeling that chart patterns reading is more closely like flipping a coin in terms of its reliability. I'm aware that it's probabilistic in nature but ***if the chances of being correct is up in the air, why is it such an universally used tool for traders & investors?*** 

To me it's much more like one of those self-fulfilling prophesy type of analysis and if the prediction turns out to be wrong, let's just stamp it as ""false breakouts"" or whatever other jargon names. I almost never hear a responsible undertaking of ownership when wrong predictions happen. This is rather in stark contrast w/, say, statistics or math based modelling for algorithmic trading that is more introspectively honest. Whoever came up/designing said model is not afraid to explicitly point out its pitfalls from a stat/math context.

I don't mean to patronize & bash TA/chart patterns cos I did make money using it here & there but it never is a tried & true tool some ""TA analysts"" make it to be. Perhaps a more experienced trader can weigh in on the issue? I don't think I'm alone in this.

Many thanks in advance for the feedback & comments!"
03/30/2021,stocks,"I realize I'm turning into That Guy by making this post, but at some point, we should just consider having an ultimate ""Technical Analysis: total bullshit or only mostly bullshit?"" thread buried somewhere in a meta-sticky."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Well the issue is most people use technicals to predict things when they should use fundamentals and economics for that. Technicals should only be used for timing and confirmation. Ex: I predict AMD will do well this year based on fundamentals, but looking at the chart I don’t quite see a solid entry yet. I like how the weekly chart is setting up but buyers haven’t stepped in yet. I would wait until I see those buyers step in to actually consider entering a position. If you use technicals the right way they can be beneficial, it’s just that most people want to be chart gurus and think they can predict where prices will go instead of letting price tell them where to go."
03/30/2021,stocks,"I just think everyone knows technical analysis nowadays, so it’s in my opinion for sure not enough. Regardless technical analysis is a thing and other investors trade off of it, so I think one should play on that."
03/30/2021,stocks,"One benefit is it simply lets you capture the current condition and events leading to the moment.

I perform TA primarily for that reason - I check out a daily, 4 hour, and 5 minute chart just to envelop myself in the decision process.

I think, personally, all the indicators and candlestick patterns are mostly a waste of time for ... like predictive purposes, with a few exceptions. Or another way I’d say it is I don’t make a decision based on those. But they’re super good at telling a story."
03/30/2021,stocks,"People who think TA is bullshit don't understand TA.  Nobody is claiming that TA is a crystal ball that predicts stock movements with 100% accuracy.  But if you use it correctly, you can increase your odds of success.

There is actually some empirical research showing that trading based on certain candlestick patterns can be a profitable strategy, but the quality of the research is poor.  Part of the problem is chart analysis is done by human eyes with the background experience of looking at thousands of charts, which can't currently be replicated by AI.  So nobody has been able to study it properly.

The key is to understand what the chart patterns reflect in terms of investor psychology and supply/demand."
03/30/2021,stocks,"I mean, the greatest trader/investor of all time aint Buffett. It’s Jim Simons and Renaissance Technologies. Dude averages 66% return per year and finds patterns inside the market.

03/30/2021,stocks,"""The firm uses quantitative trading, where staff tap data in its petabyte-scale data warehouse to assess statistical probabilities for the direction of securities prices in any given market. Staff attribute the breadth of data on events peripheral to financial and economic phenomena that Renaissance takes into account, and the firm's ability to manipulate large amounts of data by deploying scalable technological architectures for computation and execution. In many ways, Renaissance Technologies, along with a few other firms, has been synthesizing terabytes of data daily and extracting information signals from petabytes of data for almost two decades now, well before big data and data analytics caught the imagination of mainstream technology.""

Yes that sounds about the same as the average /r/stocks user looking at a graph and crunching some numbers.

There's a reason Renaissance hires people with bizarre backgrounds like speech recognition experts, and avoids hiring anyone with even the slightest background in finance. It's because the math they're doing is so far beyond traditional TA that it doesnt even make sense to compare them."

It was one or the other. In one book by a turtle who washed out he gave a more “here’s the system” called way of the turtle. The other by Michael Covel gave the MA one plus the story behind trades and what not. 

Was more of a one or the other. Not together"

2021-03-30 07:05:33,stocks,"What are FTDs and why it can affect the overall market I’ve been keeping up with this sub, as well as many other subs, and YouTubers, to figure out what’s going on in the market. 

This info could explain why so many of you have seen red days.

FTDs, or failure to deliver, are stocks that the market makers, MM, were unable to deliver, even after you paid for the stock.

Normally that’s not a big deal, maybe the MMs couldn’t find a stock in time, and will give you an IOU until it can locate that share.

Well, this would be ok, if you don’t use it as trading strategy to make millions of dollars from retail, allegedly.

If an MM is in the business of selling retail investors a bunch of stock, they could in theory wait to purchase that stock at a later date, possibly when the stock is at a lower price.

That’s great, until you run into a problem. What if you start shorting the stock, in order to reduce the price, so you can buy the stock you owe, but the price doesn’t go down, so you short it some more, until you surpass the available float?

Well now you have a problem, and the DTCC has big concerns. So many in fact, that they just passed a new rule, an amendment to that rule, and had a secret meeting in the last couple of weeks.

What are these rules about?

I believe it’s called the Recovery and Wind Down procedure. It states that in case of a financial crisis, the DTCC (those who actually owe the stock, and put your name as the “investor”) will be in charge of slowly liquidating any MM that’s over leverage, and transfer its clients into a “safe” MM in order to not collapse the market.

Well why is that important, and how does that affect me?

Wednesday-Friday was when the new rule came into effect, where every HF and investor is required to state their short positions daily, instead of monthly. 

Lo and behold, Friday there was a liquidation of a HF, who was over leveraged 30to1 across different accounts, banks, and markets.

So what is going on in the market?

I have stated only a brief summary of what people are talking about around the web. I will not answer this questions, as this is all speculative, and not financial advice. I can give you my hypothesis, but I believe I said enough for you to come out with your own conclusion.

The banks are wondering the same thing, and are asking if that HF is the only one. All we know is that some HF, and investors are over leverage, enough for the DTCC to be concerned and pass new rules.

I bring this info here, because retail is always the last one to know anything, even if all of this is public info. I hope many of you can use this, and prevent you from becoming bagholders, from what looks to be turbulent times."
03/30/2021,stocks,This is completely wrong. The unwind had nothing to do with shorts (Hwang was levered long) and there is no new rule which requires daily short reporting. No clue where you got that from though there’s a lot of misinformation floating around here about DTCC and NSCC
03/30/2021,stocks,"Idk about the whole dtcc, the story here is a fund was overleveraged in derivatives that blew up in their face and banks are holding the bag or at least some are, now the billion dollar question is was archegos the only one or are we in for another bear Stearns. But I'm not quite sure what this has to do with dtcc and failures to deliver so maybe you could elaborate"
03/30/2021,stocks,"Archegos was given another chance after it's CEO was convicted of insider trading back 2012


Goldman Sachs compliance rejected their request to have a seat at the prime table, but relented after the institutional sales goons wanted all those big fat trading fees.

I think that this clown just ran out of favors."
03/30/2021,stocks,"That’s because declaring your daily short positions is not a new rule. It’s an old rule, that HF didn’t follow, because it contradicted another rule. 

This confusion has been resolved, and HF are now required to do so daily.

I never said that this new rule is why the HF was liquidated. We don’t know why they were liquidated, only that their risk far exceeded their assets.

All I said was that banks are asking themselves, are any other HF over leverage, and am I at risk of losing billions of dollars, like other banks have already."
03/30/2021,stocks,"The problem is that all of this is not directly connected... yet.

Nobody knows why the HF was margin called, did they short a certain stock, or bought other stock that crashed and got margin called?

Information is not being released, because it’s not beneficial for those with money.

The DTCC passed a new rule, it was implemented last week, and it deals with short positions, and covering liquidations and bankruptcy of market makers, not hedge funds.

FTDs are a main concern, and a reason why this rule was passed so fast. FTDs are not being discussed because they are the boogie man. If defaulting on your loan can crater you credit score, FTDs would have the same effect on the market.

People would lose faith that there’s not enough stock available to buy. FTDs are the powder that subprime loans were in ‘08.

I hope that helps!"
03/30/2021,stocks,"Please share the DTCC or NSCC “rule” you’re referring to. 

Also it’s not a big mystery. Hwang was overleveraged in VIAC and DISC which got taken out to the woodshed when VIAC did a secondary, and Chinese dual listed companies which traded off Thursday on the SEC threatening delisting for Chinese companies that don’t comply with US accounting standards. Thursday his PBs asked him to post more collateral, he couldn’t, Friday GS and MS started to sell his book."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Of course you are at risk, if prime brokers decide to be stricter with leverage limits and force HFs to deleverage/liquidate then yes we are all at risk. BUT these prime brokers/banks also have skin the game and it wouldn't be wise to liquidate suddenly as that would cause havoc globally. It could happen yes, but I don't think it will. There may be deleveraging, but it would be gradual to minimise the market impact."

Excerpt:

> The release said the name change “is expected to take effect in May” and called the change a “public declaration of the company’s future-forward investment in e-mobility.” It said Voltswagen will be placed as an exterior badge on all EV models with gas vehicles having the company’s iconic VW emblem only.

> To “preserve elements of Volkswagen’s heritage,” the release said the company planned to retain the dark blue color of the VW logo for gas-powered vehicles and use light blue to differentiate “the new, EV-centric branding.”

> The release said Voltswagen of America would remain an operating unit of Volkswagen Group of America and a subsidiary of Volkswagen AG, with headquarters in Herndon, Virginia.

Excerpt:

> Investors reacted positively to the letter swap. Volkswagen American depository receipts, or ADRs, rise 5.2% Monday. What’s more, the stock has gained more than 64% year to date. Shares shot up earlier this month after the company laid out more ambitious EV goals.

> The name change isn’t the only thing affecting shares. The stock is getting a lift after an upgrade by Jefferies analyst Philippe Houchois. On Sunday, he raised his rating to Buy from Hold and increased his price target for preferred stock to about $350 a share from $235."

03/30/2021,stocks,"Most I've heard pronounce the k softly.  So it will sound differently.  

I think the change is cheesy marketing to desperately sell their brand as a major EV manfuacturer, but I'm glad they still picked a V word so VW still applies.  GM new logo was similar.  These companies aren't confident in their branding and thus feel the need to reimage themselves in order to further convey the idea that 'hey we make trendy chic EVs too, dont forget about us.'"
03/30/2021,stocks,Germans pronounce V as F. So its Foltswagen. After hearing this English speakers may write it Faultswagen.
03/30/2021,stocks,"Personally, I find it easier to pronounce the K if the name is misspelled as ""Folkswagen.""  That's because the L can be skipped.

2021-03-30 06:19:07,stocks,"Strategy: I'm out of anything that looks wonky right now. BABA?  Out. Too much uncertainty with China. 

BND? Out.  Bonds are being sold off like crazy and real yields are negative. 

GE?  Out.  Going through a restructuring right now which seems to look promising, but they're doing wonky things like a reverse stock split that I don't like.

GME? Out.  Yeah it might go to the moon, and Ryan Cohen might save it, but then again I might also be dead by the time any of that happens. 

(I was holding all 4 of these at one point)

Other hypothetical examples:
ARKK? Pass. If I had bought in 12 months ago, great play.   But right now?  It's not something I'm sure I want to be holding, and definitely don't want to be buying at this price.  Cathy Wood did great, but her God talk is wonky to me and anyone who was heavy in tech had a great year, not just her.  I don't know if I trust her abilities going forward. 

ARKX? Pass, for same reasons plus I don't understand why she picked the stocks she did at all.  Wonky.  God talk, etc. 

TSLA? Pass.  Way too expensive right now even if future earnings might (keyword *might*)  justify this P/E ratio. Too volatile, too. 

XXII? Pass.  You probably haven't heard of this one, but someone recommended them to me because they might be the future of smoking with their ""zero nicotine cigarettes"".  That's just wonky, folks, even if there might be a small market for that, ugh, maybe. 

Bitcoin?  Out.  Not a real currency and way too volatile and uncertain. 

I probably triggered some people. Feel free to explain why I'm wrong about any of these.

And of course, no risk, no reward.  So if you want to put a little bit into Bitcoin or Tesla, by all means.  But my current philosophy is that we can just avoid all the wonkiness and go for the straight forward plays.  You know, the Apples, Microsofts, Costcos, Phillip Morris, etc.  Or hell, go ahead and stick it in VOO. I didn't, that's not my style, but it's a safer play than probably everything I listed at the beginning.

I'm new to this so take what I'm saying with a grain of salt.  But I think I understand why they say that ""most people lose money in the stock market"".  It's because they're always chasing performance (buying ARKK at ATH) and picking winners based off some vague notion like ""Elon Musk and Tesla are the future"".  It's not smart, and it's a recipe for disaster. 

If you are like Mr. Keith Gill and can truly identify deep value, more power to you.  But you don't find deep value by buying the same stocks that everyone else is. 

TL; DR: the markets are pretty weird and uncertain right now.  So, IMO, why make things any more uncertain or wonky?  Just stick with good businesses that will do well in the sort, mid, and long term.

Or do index funds. I chose individual stocks because with my picks I think I will be safer in the event of a correction.  The market can be kinda wonky sometimes, too.  But that's just my style based on my current risk tolerance. 

So far I am slightly up on the month and on the YTD, with a look for the long-term."

Everything good up until this part. Probably the best value indicator for me is when people go nuts over a stock, that's when you know you can ride the wave or pay attention to the ceilling and buy puts on it. The only certainty in the market IMO is that everything goes down at some point and, as your bearish posture suggests, you might as well profit from something secure as drops in the price of a security (else you're implying this is more of a ""manipulated"" market than an uncertain one, agreeing with you on either)."

03/30/2021,stocks,"I like your argument and agree wholeheartedly with most sentiments although rather lacking in regards to factual information especially when using ""wonky"" as an argument against said companies. 

I've always wondered why folks haven't looked to mineral resources as a safe strategy for portfolio growth. We know 'Green' electrification is the way forward and we know we need an absolute shit ton of certain strategic minerals such as Copper, Nickel, Zinc, Lithium among other things. The only mineral I've really seen this exponential growth hit was Lithium. Even with Lithium I'm hesitant to say it's the way forward as we've come to find the impact of lithium mining is extremely detrimental to aquifers and the environment overall. 

Back Pedal a little bit to Strategic metals, Copper, Nickel, Zinc. These metals have a multitude of applications and will have many more come future breakthroughs. So I ask, why haven't we seen Mining players see similar growth albeit some have seen tremendous gains but overall it's not reflected as proportional to Lithium.

I've been fortunate enough to get myself a Mining Engineering degree so I know a thing or two about the industry and can pick out the nuggets of gold when I read through the right Technical report which to the untrained eye looks like utter nonsense. This has led me to making some pretty wise investments thus far.

What I'm getting at is, I'm with you on the safe bets but why haven't the masses realized that in order to further these technologies and initiatives we need to dig up some rock and we have well known miners digging up some good rock and others with huge potential.

My high flying mining players I've got in my portfolio at the moment are:
 Rio Tinto (Huge miner, equally huge dividend)
 Barrick (Gold Player who recently erased some big debt and are frothing at the mouth with future potential given the trajectory of inflation)
Talon Metals (High Grade Green Nickel project in the US)(Future Mine in the US and will come online as the only remaining US Nickel mine shuts down (~2023)
BHP (Huge Player even bigger Staying power also a solid dividend) 



TLDR: Why gamble exponential losses when you can have safe solid returns and still see solid growth. Tech needs minerals, Minerals need miners. Give the miners some love <3"

03/30/2021,stocks,"Of those you mentioned, I think BABA is worth the risk.

In recent news, Jack Ma is trying to rebuild ANT valutation by increasing its cut of profit respective to that of the banks it works with. This shows he still has bargaining power.

I’m no expert, but suspect the interests of Ma and the Chinese government are largely the same, that they need each other to prosper and both know it.
Ma obviously can’t go against the party, it would be business (and potentially personal) suicide. He has little reason to do so, aside maybe personal ideals. Still in the past he has shown willingness to bow if needed.

The party wants to control power and information, and a growing stable economy. They want China to be a leader of the world and its successful business is reason of proudness.
This is more easily accomplished ensuring the loyalty of business leaders, rather than dismantling what they have built.

BABA trades at a relatively low PE. Even if new government regulation was shrinks its profits and ability to grow, the risk is probably already priced in.


GME is interesting for the opposite reason. It’s highly speculative and volatile. If it drops heavily, say around 50-100, there is a good chance it will shoot up again especially if Cohen starts to publicize and implement new directions to grow the business. 180ish is the level it likes to bounce back to, lately."

When it goes back up I get the overwhelming feeling it won’t be in the next few weeks or even next few months. When I zoom out, buying in February was a weird time- things have quite a ways to go down before they are in a place that makes any sense. 

I was going to go full-Bogelhead but now I don’t even know about that. I watched The Big Short and discovered Micheal Burry has a new prediction. Hyperinflation and a total market collapse by 2022. Now, I understand that’s kinda his whole brand, but if it makes sense on the surface to a novice investor and makes sense to a market genius there might be something to it. We all can feel the market isn’t right. I’m going to bank some cash, buy some tangible assets (I.e buy some shit and spend money while I can) and look into inflation balanced commodity ETFs. If he’s right, and even assuming the market is able to recover eventually as it always does, this is NOT the dip, not even close."
03/30/2021,stocks,">Bitcoin? Out. Not a real currency and way too volatile and uncertain.

This is the one that completely stumps me on how the value is still ~10X up over the year.  

I keep hearing 'hedge against inflation'...'the future of currency'...

On any given day the rise/fall of BTCUSD value can be more 'inflation/deflation' than the USD has seen in a decade.  

And as far as replacing governmental currencies... that's a pipe-dream that would take years in the making.  Tighter regulations and  simple volatility precludes that happening anytime soon... people want to know that the $1 they spent on X on Tuesday can buy the same next Tuesday.  

... And as for the argument that TSLA, etc. is now taking BTCUSD as payments (solidifying it as a currency standard) I guarantee that the moment that transaction clears they're converting it to USD, Yen, etc.  This is probably the biggest red-herring of them all.  

I do think digital currency is the future... but no way in hell do I think BTCUSD is 'destined' to be the one and worth the current price."

GameStop I’m holding my 5 shares, I’m not in it for the money, I’m in it for the memes.

The rest I don’t really have an opinion on except one which I think you should reconsider.

Bitcoin. It’s being seen by many people and companies as a real asset/hedge against inflation. It has always been volatile and uncertain, but that hasn’t stopped it from going from a penny for multiple bitcoin to 60,000$ for a bitcoin. Most people don’t feel comfortable buying in because it’s too volatile, but the fact is it’s literally the best investment of the past decade, and so far even the best investment of this decade. The way I look at it is a hedge against basically everything. Everyone should put in 1–5% of their stock portfolio in bitcoin, not only would it increase its value if everyone did so, but it would lessen the volatility in the long run. Not only that, but what’s a few % of your portfolio? You should be making a decent return, probably a very minimum of 5%(just to beat inflation) in your portfolio, so if you put 5% of bitcoin in your portfolio you’re losing out on one year of gains by putting 5% into bitcoin, and that’s saying that it goes to 0$, which will never happen. 

I’m assuming you live in the USA, but it holds true no matter where you live, but if the USA has an collapse of its massive debt, things could get really bad here, our dollar could become worthless. For me, 5% of my money in bitcoin is a hedge against that securing my future, knowing I will be able to be independent from the government if it does happen. I’d put the probability at maybe 5% or more of a total/major collapse in my lifetime, and that’s just piece of mind. I’d put the probability that bitcoin becomes a stable/seen as a legitimate currency in the next 10-20 years at 90%. 5% that it completely fails. For me, those are good odds. I can’t see bitcoin just leaving completely. If anything, each continent gets its own form of blockchain and bitcoin becomes the middleman for exchanging currency."

Most commonly, you should compare the investment you're looking at to the index that investment is covered by, only buy it if you think it will beat the index. If not, then buy the index."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Most of peoples predictions for the future are way off though. During the dot com bubble, alot of companies that people thought had future potential went under. I dont think anyone could have predicted half the shit Apple came up with when smart phones were not a thing. 

I guess what Im saying is, especially in tech for the past couple of years damn near everything is going up, probably because everyone has their own version of the future with these companies in mind. But that doesnt matter if its not the right prediction."
03/30/2021,stocks,I like your style.
03/30/2021,stocks,My advice is pretty similar to Buffet's.  I didn't make any of this stuff up.
03/30/2021,stocks,"SPX is literally at an all time high, 20% higher than before the biggest global economic disaster in decades one year ago, and you think the bottom is in? seems like we've just passed euphoria and are at the beginning of the denial/bull trap stage."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Yea, I knew I should have dumped arkk when boomers in my company chat were asking about arkk. And millennials were just asking with a straight face: why wouldn't I just invest in arkk?

Arkk was around 145 then. There has been no mentioning of arkk since 😂😁"
03/30/2021,stocks,"I get what you're saying, but you're quoting Buffet to justify buying things in the OP's post like Tesla. This is peak reddit investing lol"
03/30/2021,stocks,Not nearly enough fear yet. SPY is like 1% off it’s ATH lol. I remember March of last year. Now that was some serious fear. People selling all their stocks and buying puts. People saying the DOW was going to go in half. This is just some people finally realizing that many of the speculative plays they were in have gone up a ridiculous amount in a very short time which was unsustainable.
03/30/2021,stocks,Right? Dude thinks he’s logically thinking but really he’s talking himself into paper handing and using this post as a cope to make him feel better about it.
03/30/2021,stocks,I’ve realized buy what everyone doesn’t buy and sell what everyone says buy.
03/30/2021,stocks,Why exactly?  Could you explain what I'm doing wrong?
03/30/2021,stocks,"Subscription business model + essential.

Now change ""essential"" to ""legally required"" and you have insurance."
03/30/2021,stocks,I also like utilities
03/30/2021,stocks,Don't forget energy. Oil stocks still have room to run.
03/30/2021,stocks,that correlation is going to become a positive 7 at the worst possible time
03/30/2021,stocks,"See, this is kind of wonky to me.  I'd rather just invest in defensive stocks and/or good companies and save some dry powder if there is a pull back."
03/30/2021,stocks,"That's exactly right. It's a feeling.  I wouldn't encourage anyone to buy on a feeling *per se*, that's kind of dangerous.  But if you can feel something is off based on your research, and/or you're not really sure what's going on with a stock or why, that's probably an indicator to stay away."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Same, its about time takes like this get traction because its beyond absurd what's been happening for the past month and people just seem to be okay with it acting like its clear skies ahead, theres nothing fundamentally supporting any of the recent rallies, everyone is margined up to the tits, and the only thing holding things together is the glue of QE and cheap as shit money flying around. Way too much volatility beneath the surface right now, we might get simultaneous inflation and deflation at this rate."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Im like 30% out. Took my winnings from very favorable positions and left some to run. 

30% cash waiting for something fun to happen. 

Whats North Korea up to? They’ve been quite. Are they dead? Have we checked on them? 

Hope they do a missile test soon"
03/30/2021,stocks,Wonky Stonks only go up and down.
03/30/2021,stocks,"No, why?"
03/30/2021,stocks,"I agree with your analysis. 

I also think that many people are uneducated, and what's worse, don't have the self-awareness to realize their own limitations. There's a term for this but I forgot what it is."
03/30/2021,stocks,"I started investing in February and bought in at ATHs and also didn't do proper research.  When I found out I didn't really know what I was doing, I made adjustments to my portfolio and sold off some stuff."
03/30/2021,stocks,😂
03/30/2021,stocks,"That's fair enough.  I bought in at $12 without really understanding why so decided it wasn't really for me.  The research I did do tells me it's probably a decent invesment, especially at your price point.  Just wasn't for me."
03/30/2021,stocks,Could you point out where exactly I'm making mistakes?  It would be helpful to learn.
03/30/2021,stocks,"Well, that's the truth of it.  Would you like to explain how someone with experience might have had a different take on things?"
03/30/2021,stocks,It's traditionally 12%.
03/30/2021,stocks,I'm not sure where you got weak conviction out of this.  I stand by my strategy 100%.  That's because I did the research and dumped anything that would give me reason to be wary.
03/30/2021,stocks,"I do think I a see a lot of dumb behavior going on.  It shouldn't surprise me, but it still does.  Kind of a coming of age thing I think."
03/30/2021,stocks,Lmao
03/30/2021,stocks,😂
03/30/2021,stocks,"I think going with your gut plus solid research is key. Going with your gut without research is a recipe for disaster. But solid research alone ensures that you can't get a ""feel"" for the market. I think that sort of read on things can be important, too.

But I'm very new to this so take that with a grain of salt. It's just what I ""feel"" is the best approach. 😉"
03/30/2021,stocks,Solar ate a shit sandwich today. I thought we were doing the green new deal?
03/30/2021,stocks,looks like about 5 minutes
03/30/2021,stocks,"Several years in a target retirement fund.  2 months in individual companies.  So take all this with a grain of salt.

I did get my degree in economics though."
03/30/2021,stocks,Why with the fed keeping the market pumped up?
03/30/2021,stocks,"If you don't know what's going on, that's probably a good idea.

My cash holdings are much less than that, but I feel like I know enough to create a stable, defensive portfolio despite the uncertainty."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Timing the market is hard. But there are companies out there that are at a fair price and genuinely seem like promising companies. Hopefully you find something you like. 

For what it's worth I also pulled out for more cash but will keep an eye out for good stocks. Mainly spooked with interest rates idk about the current price."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Selling low, buying high ?

I unloaded all my cash into market, way too many dips to buy, not enough cash to do so."
03/30/2021,stocks,"It depends how you want to play it.  The problem with riding the wave is when you get in or out too late.  As for buying puts, I don't do options, but that could be another approach.  

Still, the safest thing is still good, reliable companies."
03/30/2021,stocks,"You’re literally describing momentum investing, not value investing."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, L3Harris. You know what they say, the best defense is fully loaded missles.

Of course you probably mean a safe portfolio, in which case just buy VT (total world) or something like 70% VTI / 30% VXUS and then proceed to unsubscribe from every investing and stock picking subreddit lol"
03/30/2021,stocks,That was not what I was proposing.
03/30/2021,stocks,I remember one year I got 1 penny.
03/30/2021,stocks,"I’d like to point you in the direction to one one my favorite places, you belong in r/vitards"
03/30/2021,stocks,I have some mining stocks as well.
03/30/2021,stocks,Lmao op is getting roasted. I don't entirely disagree with him but air handling is hilarious
03/30/2021,stocks,That's fair!  Best of luck to you.
03/30/2021,stocks,If you can afford it then it's probably not a horrible play.  Just wasn't for me.
03/30/2021,stocks,"I haven't done any research on TSM but as the #1 in semiconductors that seems like a pretty solid bet.  Make sure to do your own research though.  As for KWEB, I haven't done the research either, but personally I don't like investing in China at the moment.  An ETF is probably better than any single company.  Again, do your own research.

I have researched MSFT and that's a wonderful, totally safe company. But again, do your own research."
03/30/2021,stocks,Just hold tight. You will be laughing.
03/30/2021,stocks,They have a good business.
03/30/2021,stocks,Would you like to address what's wrong with the strategy?
03/30/2021,stocks,"Religious people tend to be a little out of touch with reality, and not really the best critical thinkers.  I don't personally trust them with my money - I'd rather handle it myself or just go for a passive index fund.

I'm not sure about Musk's alien talk but in general if I see a CEO or fund manager saying things that may be out of touch with reality, that's cause for alarm for me."
03/30/2021,stocks,"No, not completely out.  I'm mostly in, just not with some companies that seem a bit more speculative or uncertain."
03/30/2021,stocks,"I'm new to this and don't want to lose my money.  You could call it scared, that's fine."
03/30/2021,stocks,"BABA: for sure!  I don't think it's necessarily a bad idea.  It's just not for me.  I think people misunderstood me and thought that I was making calls for what everybody else should do. I was just sharing what I'm doing because I'm risk averse thanks to the current climate as well as my own financial situation.  

GME: I thought about buying back in but won't do so that at this current price.  I think you're right if it does drop it's very possible that it could shoot up again. I don't know if I want to bother with that game anymore but if it gets low enough I may consider."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Yep, it's about aggressive and conservative growth.  But hey where's the fun in leaving it at that?

> Many day traders and swing traders are chasing volatility, though. That’s kind of the point.

That's fair enough, and true.  But I think there's a lot of noobs who don't really understand what's going on and YOLO into things like Bitcoin and Tesla.  It's a recipe for disaster."
03/30/2021,stocks,I sold some for losses and others for gains.  I am still up.  This was in no way a troll.
03/30/2021,stocks,Some were a loss some were a gain. Net gain overall.
03/30/2021,stocks,"GME is a weird one. It wouldn’t possibly become 25 bucks a share ever again. But if it starts a squeeze, it could pull the rest of the market down due to giant Hedge Fund covering aka (sell off). I argue GME has a bright future, however if you buy now, you are in for the squeeze."
03/30/2021,stocks,More than BABA or ARKK?  I'm not so sure about that. Despite my doubts I think in the long-term these will probably do at least okay.
03/30/2021,stocks,2 more days til Q1 report 🙌🏽
03/30/2021,stocks,He predicts inflation and I expect that much to be true. His Weimar hyperinflation posting wasn't what he thinks will happen.
03/30/2021,stocks,"Hey there, actually I loved that film but Burray's recent predictions feel a bit off to me, too.  He did convince me to take my money out of VOO, I just don't see right now as the best time to bet on the market.  But I made a defensive portfolio that should do well in the event of a correction or crash.  And if that doesn't come any time soon, I'll still get some decent upside.

What I find wacky about Burray are his predictions for Weimar level hyperinflation, as well as some of his weird political views.  Something feels a little out of touch to me.

But we can certainly learn from him.  Anyone who says ""business as usual"" right now is kidding themselves."
03/30/2021,stocks,Why didnt you just wait for it to go back up?
03/30/2021,stocks,"BTC is not meant to be a replacement for any government currency at the present time. It is an asset like gold. The majority of people that invest in BTC are just holding it as a store of value, not to use as a currency. 

I can guarantee you that TSLA and any other company out there accumulating BTC is not exchanging it for fiat. They are putting it into cold storage through a custodial service. 

I’m just guessing, but it doesn’t sound like you or the OP have done your DD on this topic."
03/30/2021,stocks,"The answer you are looking for is; There is a shit ton of capital supporting it. Both TSLA and bitcoin, it doesnt matter if they are or arent the future, there is so much money and belief in it right now that fundamentals dont apply in their cases."
03/30/2021,stocks,You underestimate Elon’s disdain for fiat
03/30/2021,stocks,What do you think about modern monetary theory?
03/30/2021,stocks,You are what you eat
03/30/2021,stocks,Wonky comment.
03/30/2021,stocks,"It's just my personal opinion.  For the same reason I would criticize someone for saying ""God will protect me from covid"".  People are free to believe as they choose, but when it comes to things that affect other people's health, I have an issue with that.  Same deal when it comes to money, especially if it's my money.  

If someone doesn't agree, no problem, they are free to invest and I hope it goes great for them."
03/30/2021,stocks,"It doesn't have to be a casino, but I respect your approach if that's how you want to approach it."
03/30/2021,stocks,Please get help fam
03/30/2021,stocks,"Yeah, right now might not be the best buy point for MSFT and AAPL, but at least if you did buy you could sleep well knowing that long-term they're going to be stable and going up."
03/30/2021,stocks,"That's my point, investing in good solid companies is actually a great way to minimize risk and beat a shaky market."
03/30/2021,stocks,"I'm not sure I understand what you're talking about.

I made money on GME."
03/30/2021,stocks,sold on the second uptrend and got out with a profit
03/30/2021,stocks,Because I didn't do my research properly.
03/30/2021,stocks,I mentioned this.
03/30/2021,stocks,I can see that.  It just has a lot of hype around it and it's not for me.
03/30/2021,stocks,"Yes.  Send me a comment.  I feel pretty confident about what I'm doing.

The most realistic disadvantage I see is that the other portfolios might outperform mine.  But I don't see a realistic scenario where mine doesn't do at least OK."
03/30/2021,stocks,I'm okay with that.
03/30/2021,stocks,That's right.
03/30/2021,stocks,Not necessarily a bad play. Just doesn't fit my risk aversion right now.  Best of luck to you!
03/30/2021,stocks,!Remindme 3 months
03/30/2021,stocks,"AAPL, MSFT, COST, PM to name a few.  Not holding too much cash."
03/30/2021,stocks,He didn't shill for any stock. Grow up.
03/30/2021,stocks,"I'm not sure nut job is a fair or nice thing to say about her, but it's definitely cause for alarm, IMO. If super high valuations weren't enough of a turn off, this was the nail in the coffin."
03/30/2021,stocks,haha me too...
03/30/2021,stocks,I bought ASML last week and I'm up 15% from that.
03/30/2021,stocks,NIO at 33 seemed pretty good too.
03/30/2021,stocks,"I love each of those stocks

What do you think of APPS?"
03/30/2021,stocks,"i'm definitely looking at ETSY, SQ, AMWL, & TDOC. healthcare took a dive b/c of AMZN announcement, so i'm looking at this as a great time to get in. hoping ASML comes down for sure"
03/30/2021,stocks,I almost sold etsy at 203 today.. but I held cause I like it. I would have easily bought back in at 196. But only had enough for 1 share... And what's a few bucks
03/30/2021,stocks,Are they cheap?
03/30/2021,stocks,"PINS was a killer pick for me in early 2020, got in under $20 & have added to the position as time has gone on. I’m expecting it will be over $100 in 2-4 years. It’s social without all the crap dialogue & my wife who is a designer uses it for projects, it’s got legs still. Second all your other picks as well, good buys."
03/30/2021,stocks,Been holding a few of these - been a rough couple months
03/30/2021,stocks,"Yeah this is it for me: 
DKNG, SQ, BA, AAPL, NKE, XPEV"
03/30/2021,stocks,Any reason I shouldn’t buy into DKNG heavy? I mean eventually they have to bring sports gambling to the rest of the country. Wouldn’t that absolutely detonate that stock?
03/30/2021,stocks,"I dont think id be quick to call these cheap given their actual valuations.

Many of these have yet to live up to their valuations in terms of performance. So far its just been people piling in, hoping someone else will pay more for it."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Oh yeah, I'm thinking about doubling my position in DKNG"
03/30/2021,stocks,"PLTR really? Propel pumped it so hard for month and it's still failing to impress. Not falling for thgr hype has been my best move yet, if it ever starts moving I'll reconsider but rather safe then bagholding"
03/30/2021,stocks,ill bet you 100k you dont even know what pltr does
03/30/2021,stocks,"All those companies aren’t buys. They are sells. When everyone gets vaccinated all of those companies are loosing value.

03/30/2021,stocks,"I just don't trust myself to make those calls.  People are criticizing me for only having 2 months experience, but that's exactly the reason why I'm not trying to make any crazy plays and just go with something safe.

I don't need to get rich off of this.  Growing my wealth steadily would be great for me.

FWIW, I also don't trust the average Redditor's or individuals ability to make those calls, either.  They seem a little less honest about it though."
03/30/2021,stocks,Sometimes stocks is just like basic retail goods economy. Things that are unknown but good quality are those which give the best value for money. That's what makes investing into stock marlet easy. When you know when you see one.
03/30/2021,stocks,Like Hyln? /s
03/30/2021,stocks,There is no such things as immune from uncertainty. More resistant maybe but not immune.
03/30/2021,stocks,Uncertainty = risk = potential profit
03/30/2021,stocks,Hope you didn’t go for financials or energy. That bubble rivals tech two months ago
03/30/2021,stocks,"Holy crap. they really unloaded the turd train on you. Here, take an upvote you poor fellow."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Wait for the next top, everything will feel very safe then"
03/30/2021,stocks,"Yes, society has reached max economic growth. We will only go downhill from here"
03/30/2021,stocks,Wow very bad play.
03/30/2021,stocks,"You are describing r/ETFs to a tee. For months, if you tried to talk logic about ARK, you were downvoted to oblivion.  Now a few down weeks and they are wanting to get out of the investment.  Unbelievable."
03/30/2021,stocks,"I got downvoted when I called out a user describing the ARK ETFs safe investments. No, they aren't. They have their space but they are definitely not safe."
03/30/2021,stocks,How about an ETF called WONK Investments LLC that holds just Wonky stocks?
03/30/2021,stocks,Companies only speaking of EBITDA is a step in the wonk-direction too.
03/30/2021,stocks,"Yeah, exactly, apart from what I said just do the research and look at the fundamentals.  Great point."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Well said, much rather have a company with a 5 billion dollar market cap that has nearly a billion dollars in operating cash flow and 4 times as much cash as they have debt. (Hint, it's not a tech company)."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Don't you feel like you're oversimplifying some of these theses?  I mean both bitcoin and TSLA trade at those prices based on other considerations than what you mentioned. 

I don't own any of them but I believe in the underlying tech."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Not at all. There is a middle ground for sure, and a good investor will balance accordingly. But contra OP, I’m not going to ditch my positions in his volatile picks just because they’re going through some turbulence."

03/30/2021,stocks,"I don't use one investment strategy. The core of my portfolio is boring ETFs that I DCA in every month. Then I have individual value stocks that are conviction plays. I also try to always keep cash in my account to take advantage of opportunities like VIAC dropping over 50% due to an idiot investor's actions, and creating a value stock out of a stock that was previously way overvalued.

The core keeps me safe, while I can active trade some, and even speculate once in a while. So technically I am a value, growth, and speculative investor, lol."

03/30/2021,stocks,"So you're buying high and selling low? When you bought did you set a timeline for how long you'd hold? 

ARK is as transparent as an actively managed fund gets and they don't hide the fact that their time horizon is at least 5 years. 

The way I see it is you shouldn't invest at any price unless this is a long term hold.  If you sell now you're not only locking on losses but you're exiting when it's now less risky to own the fund. 

I have/had 8% allocation total to two ARK funds. I firmly believe we're in a period of disruption unlike any other in modern history. Even so, half my portfolio is in boring total market index funds because I know the ARK ride can be vomit inducing. An 8% allocation is large enough to make a difference but not so much that I'd ever be tempted to sell. 

I'd hope people buying ARK funds would understand the volatility and risks when setting up their portfolio but the more I read anything ARK related it seems most don't."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Lol while the rest of these bums FUD, I’ve been steady buying the whole time. Keep the discounts coming."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Im not the one you replied to but:

You probably only wanted to advise people to buy well earning and proven blue chip companies with this post, something that is simply not very volatile right? 

But the reason people are giving you a hard time here is because you literally (and accidentally i suppose) advertised for: buy high, sell low. I assume you are a long term holder of companies since you quoted buffet in this thread, but this is the exact opposite of what he would do.

The way you phrased it it sounds like you buy stocks when everything is fine and certain around a company and sell as soon as even the smallest uncertainty around it arises. 

I mean selling GE only because of a reverse stock split? really? why did you buy into it anyway if you had such a low conviction to hold this Company? Even Companies like Google or Visa have arguably higher uncertainties going on than this.

If you always start selling your companies as soon as stuff like this happens you are not going to make much money let alone outperform the market."
03/30/2021,stocks,It sounds like you only want to buy when times are good and sell at the slightest uncertainty or when things get “wonky” and not just that but sell once the prices are already going down and deep red. “Uncertainty with China” is the reason you sold BABA? I don’t buy Chinese stocks for that reason but the uncertainty with China has always been here since 2008 so why did you even buy in the first place knowing that risk as been there for awhile. Out of GE because of a “wonky reverse stock split” like unless your a day trader this means nothing to a long term investor. If you believe in the company long term it doesnt really matter what they do with their stock. So once again why even buy in the first place. Also wont buy ARKK because of “wonky god talk”? The god talk has always been here for a long while ever since she first started managing money. Back in December and January this sub loved Cathie Wood and don’t you dare say anything bad or prepare for the downvotes or how she and her stocks are the future and people are holding long term. Now that the hype has died off because everyone turned against her now and are now bringing up “god talk” is the reason they sold and not because the stock is down over 30%. So much for the long term investing strategy and the future lol. The point is your post basically encourages a buy high sell low mentality. Like why even buy into these companies in the first place is my question if you are a long term investor?
03/30/2021,stocks,You are investing in oil? Good luck

Jk, we all need to invest within our own risk management. I would look into dividend stocks if I were you.

Or you could write options, which is the safest investment you can do if done right, since you’re technically selling time. Unless you pull a HF and do naked options."

03/30/2021,stocks,"OP here, FWIW I didn't mean to say that the entire market is wonky and we should all panic.  Actually the people panicking seem kind of wonky to me. 

I think we should be prudent right now.  We're obviously not going to have a bull run like we had in the previous 12 months.  And we very well may have a correction or significant pullback. Hell, there could even be a crash.  It's always a possibility.

But the panicking and absolute certainty that we're headed for the worst just doesn't feel right to me.  And I don't think it's supported by most economists. 

The climate is obviously uncertain right now.  People who are certain that we are fine or certain that we are fucked don't know what they're talking about.  Nobody knows.  Which is why I recommend a conservative, balanced approach.  Especially in this climate."

There's bearish arguments for Apple, Microsoft, Costco, etc. And then you make a curious statement about how you don't get rich by investing in what everyone else does (using Keith Gill as an example).... but you're saying you want to invest in blue chip stocks - which is exactly what everyone else invests in.

You think TSLA is expensive now?   Give it a year and you'll wish you had bought in now.   My guess is you've been in all of this for a good whole two months.  Go ahead and start reading some investment books.  Should only cost around a hundred bucks for a pile of them.  Then come back once you've gained some knowledge.

But, despite some of his eccentricity, I can't help but feel he's on to something- mountains of new investors putting it all in the market, betting on memes and throwing caution to the wind, stimulus checks pumping up inflation.

03/30/2021,stocks,"My reasoning has enough elements for me that I decided I could be wrong and feel good about selling NIO. There’s a chip shortage that’s going to affect production in the near term for months or years. There’s skepticism over Chinese reportings on earnings and the SEC is discussing removing those that don’t meet their standards over time. The CCP is known to be defensive over their financials. There are billion dollar hedge fund sell offs of Chinese stocks, which I’m told is unrelated and more to do with shorts. China as a whole has pressed political tensions with the world and the outlook is uncertain. They show aggression in the South China Sea standoffs with the US, with armed troops in India’s Himalayas and in Philippines fishing waters recently. The Uhghurs prison camps containing millions of Chinese minority Muslims that I’ve been aware of for a year or so are becoming internationally recognized as a modern day genocide. 

I bought in at like 45, some bought at 60, people said it’d go to 200 during the hype- but you know where it was for the past 20 years prior? Between a 1.5 and 15. Most stocks I see have almost as insane 2020 growth and there’s no reason to think most won’t work back to their average. And for all that, I’m out."

Just play it safe and learn the terminology and basics of the market with stocks and then later learn derivatives, learn how macro economic issues effect the market, learn through experience and time by moving in slow rather then like a dude that discovers wsb and yolos 75% of his savings on AMC.

03/30/2021,stocks,"If you want to shave off years of learning.

Follow these steps;

1) Treat it like gambling. Much like poker, plan your bet, know what youre going to do ahead if time.

2) Risk should be appropriate to your portfolio size. I assume all companies may drop 50-100%. The position size factors this in and so a failure will result in a loss that either will be covered by my annual savings or return.

3) IV lines.

4) ticker selection - companies must be
- product/service very popular/known
- has utility to the economy and consumer.
- profitable
- limited competitors.

If you look at ant company that has done quite well in the last 20, theyve pretty much ticked all these boxes.

03/30/2021,stocks,"on a 5-10 year time horizon, it's relatively safe—with plenty more upside than your VTI's for example."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Potentially very true, but also potentially a grey area imo.

If it's a smallish-cap company talking about EBITDA and/or operating margin fixin to burst out of the negative and into the positive, that's simply a milestone growth point in an emerging company that could well be a solid growth stock pick for multiple years to come.

But you're right, there's absolutely potential for that sort of thing simply being turd polish. (Instead of EBITDA, it could also some sort of non-GAAP measure, or they could simply be focusing on some sort of impressive-sounding-yet-ultimately-meaningless metric like ""widgets sold to infertile eskimos aged 85 and older"", no offense intended to anyone who may fit that description of course.)

If it's an inordinate amount of mention, and they're clearly avoiding doing some important things like projecting future growth for top line and/or bottom line numbers, or avoiding mentioning long-term strategy, firm/quantifiable future milestones, or providing longer-term growth estimates, gtfo for sure."
03/30/2021,stocks,"I'm feelin you here. There are some bitcoin-adjacent plays (SQ, PYPL, smaller-cap juniors in the industry) that could potentially be worth a shot, and there are some emerging industry plays that are worth holding for the long haul even if they've gotten their asses kicked the last couple months. But there are also a lot of bad plays whose downside has been laid bare lately. 

Profitable clean energy companies that have been beaten up as badly as the high-flying speculation plays will come back once they prove to be the ones who score the big contracts in the coming stimulus bill. 

FSR, HYLN, WKHS won't see any revenue boosts this year regardless of policy or spending, but CHPT very well might. (It also might not, but at least it's actually out there making sales and putting products in the market before 2022.) 

Re: China... no telling. BIDU, BABA, JKS, BIBI are all monsters from what I can tell. But if CCP is also a monster--the wrong kind--on the ""do they or do they not commit genocide and countless lesser human rights atrocities"" scale, profitability won't much matter."
03/30/2021,stocks,Out with it you tease!
03/30/2021,stocks,"“Trading at those prices based on other considerations” than the fundamentals is exactly where the wonkiness comes in.

What is belief in underlying tech actually worth? Will TSLA’s underlying tech generate the kind of revenue growth it takes to justify the massive valuation? How long will it take for that growth to realize? How much market share growth will TSLA be able to achieve once ev infrastructure takes hold and economy options comparable to the Honda Civic present themselves at much more accessible prices and locations? If tsla remains a niche higher-end vehicle, its uphill climb to justifying current valuations is already going to be difficult. 

It’s certainly all possible, but this far out, calling the whole thing wonky is absolutely fair."

The emotional stuff on red days is what initially caused me to think ""hey can I really trust this company?"" And for some of them that answer was no or not sure.  Now the companies I'm holding are either a yes or most likely.

I hope that clears up some of the hate.  I really think it's misguided."

03/30/2021,stocks,"I understand what you mean but I bought into these companies without doing proper research in February.  Red days had me asking myself if I could really trust some of these companies, and the answer I came up with was either no, maybe not, or not sure.  I wasn't fully aware of the risks until I actually saw my money being eaten away at.  That caused me to reevaluate.

It was a rookie mistake, but that's exactly why I'm approaching it differently now.  I'm sharing my learning process.

That's the thing.  I wasn't making educated investments.  I bought in on a whim and later realized I hadn't properly weighed the risk.  For me *personally* BABA, for example, isn't worth it right now.  It also wasn't worth it when I bought it, it's just that I wasn't making smart decisions as a first-time investor.  It's not really because of the (presumably temporary) price drop.  The temporary price drop just made me realize that ""ugh, I'm not really cool losing money on this"".  Someone else might have a different risk tolerance.  I wasn't totally aware of what my risk tolerance was until I started seeing it in action.

No, you misunderstood.  This was directed at people who think they can spot the next GME like Keith Gill did.  He spotted GME a year ago or so when it was trading around $4.  Many of the people thinking they found something revolutionary with Tesla got in at all time highs.

All these corrections is quite a nice buying opportunity for plenty of things. Make sure to spread your money out, not everything will rebound in foreseeable future, some things will end up stubbornly staying down for quite a long while.

I would suggest looking into investor psychology, it has the perfect explanation why people are always buying high and selling low. No matter how much you tell everyone that buying dips, corrections and market crashes are excellent opportunity, everyone always keeps doomsday posting at red days.

On opposite side of spectrum, keep track of the most bearish people, when they are chattering about all of the buying opportunities, market is about to have correction. Though they get slaughtered off the market, so you might need to find different bears for signals."

It kind of goes hand in hand with non-profitable, hence has some degree of wonkiness by default. In the worst cases (IMO anyway) if it's not about profitability, it is about pumpy or misleading management that like parading this good looking number on CNBC and any possible outlets.

Which is why I think my reaction was this

That's why you're getting pushback/sarcasm in these comments. Your entire post isn't really saying much, and can basically be boiled down to saying you have a lower risk tolerance. Which is fine - you can be successful still (look up Bogleheads investing, seriously)."

I just wanted to share my strategy and it's by no ends the end-all, be-all.  And obviously not personally tested on my end.  But it's also not exactly novel advice.  Investing in sound companies is pretty much the Buffet approach.

03/30/2021,stocks,"Actually, probably not. The sub jumped from around 1 mil to 2,5 mil through this whole Gamestop stuff, so there are many new people here. Thats why we see these ''Please dont sell and rope your neck over this'' posts every other red day."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Hold and DCA is great advice because the market as a whole does go up. Panic selling is dangerous. I get that. However, I think new users forget individual stocks, even established ones (let alone memes), are risky. That's the flipside we lose when we advise people to essentially never sell, which seems to be the consensus here.

On subs with older user bases I've read stories of people investing on this or that supposedly couldn't fail ticker and they lost 90% over and over again over, even across decades. Saw an interview with Peter Lynch in the 90's were he basically scoffed at how small time retail investors will throw $5,000 at a stock and not realize it's essentially gambling. John Bogle in ""Common Sense Investing"" details how even experienced active fund managers, the biggest in the world even, over time, quickly fall below the market average. Picking individual stocks actually requires much more skill and luck than we give it on these subs. 

I'm not going to sell off my whole portfolio, but I don't think it's as bad as some here make it seem to sell something you've lost faith in. I sold one position out of twelve and I feel good about it because I was over it. I will be buying ""dips"" still as well, just not with the same reckless abandon I was before, because I accept some of these companies just might not make it."

03/30/2021,stocks,"Yeah.  I appreciate that.  I know it has nothing to do with me and everything to do with them.  This happens all the time... make relatively sensible post about any topic on Reddit and get met with absolute disdain and scorn. 

Like I'm open to correction and dialogue and being wrong. But most people just say things like ""it's obvious you're new"" without taking any time to explain what they think I'm doing wrong, or making an effort to understand where I'm coming from.  It's never really about dialogue, it's always about saltiness. 

But yeah I understand it at this point. But at the same time it's still something I'm reckoning with.  I think it's a big problem with humanity (the inability to dialogue), and it's not exclusive to Reddit or to the internet.  The internet just makes it easier since we're all anonymous. 

I digress.  I'm not familiar with HYLN but the others look like good long term picks and good on you for buying on dips."

03/30/2021,stocks,"That's also a good point.  I started buying individual stocks in February.  I decided to time the market a bit, because it looked like the S+P 500 and especially tech had just had a massive run up.  It seems my intuition was correct, at least on tech, which we all know has suffered a pull back.

But because ""time in the market"" is a good thing I also wanted to get in ASAP.  So I decided to buy in safely.  

Yep, it's just my strategy and didn't realize it would make the front page.  It's not the word of God and I have very little actual experience."
03/30/2021,stocks,"That's fair enough, thanks for pointing it out.

To clarify, I don't think they're bad investments in and of themselves.  I really don't.  I just think they're bad investments for people who don't really understand why they're investing in them and are just following the crowd.  This behavior happens IMO.

As for my analysis of people, I'm new to investing but I'm not new to people.  People do dumb stuff all the time, in all sorts of arenas, and it helps me to get a feel on what those dumbs things are and why they do them.  It's just part of my learning process as an investor and as an individual.  It may not be important to everyone, or anything ground-breaking, but it's important information for me.  I just felt like sharing and I did not mean to be offensive."

As for companies like BABA, etc.  I don't really know if it's a bad investment or not.  Probably not in the long-term.  But there's an element of uncertainty there (China) that I don't like.  That's the wonkiness.  As a new guy I prefer not to touch it."

And I literally went on a portfolio killing spree as well. I call it, killing Sheep. Took down GILD, AAL, LAC, ICLN, SUNW.  Some gains, some losses. Funneled that money basically all into AAPL. Now I have 100 AAPL, something I’ve always been wanting to do. And if it wasn’t for the recent correction, I wouldn’t have done it.

03/30/2021,stocks,"Yes when it comes to finance people seemingly start to suddenly act very reckless and sensitive.

When people buy a house or a car, they do research. Read reviews, ask for opinions, generally do their homework on the asset itself and dont just buy on a whim.

When it comes to stocks or other financial assets like options, people suddenly only need to read a ticker symbol on reddit with a few rocket emojis to throw half their life savings into it. 

If i have learned 1 thing from my short time on the stock market its that Greed & Envy sure as hell are the strongest of the 7 deadly sins lol. Still, nobody is exempt from these and we need our best to keep them in check to not do stupid shit. I say this being an atheist even.

Also if you are absolutely new to investing in and of itself, i recommend reading some books or at least watch some videos about it from the old legends out there like Peter Lynch(favorite), Ray Dalio, Charles Munger and of course Warren Buffet/Benjamin Graham."

03/30/2021,stocks,"Yes I’ve read all about that aspect of the Chinese stock game and while it gives me pause I bought at such a good price that I’m willing to take the risk that comes with the possible instability of that arrangement. If something happens with delisting etc or in the unlikely event there is a change in the US government’s attitude toward Chinese stocks I have a good buffer in profit to get out intact. I don’t think it’s realistic to say there will be some sort of prohibition or blacklisting given the nature of investing today, it’s a worldwide market and people want to invest broadly, I don’t see protectionism being a long term strategy of regulators. If anything it will become more commonplace to buy Chinese stocks, I own several others, JD, Baidu, etc and I don’t have fear of losing it all. My wife has done business in China for many years with importation of reverse osmosis water filtration products and it’s like doing business anywhere else for the most part. I have no fear of the Chinese or anybody really, doing business whether in stocks or buying products direct involves risk no matter who you are buying or selling to. You can accept that as part of your outlook and go forward or do something with less risk."

So I don't have much to invest (right now, I have put about $1000 in), and to put it bluntly, I'm pretty dumb when it comes to the stock market. I know the basics. Basically stocks 101. But what I can invest, I'm buying little bits at a time (1 to 2 shares in expensive stock, 5 to 10 in less expensive), mostly at the end of the week if I see a dip and only in industries I understand and follow. I like tech, so I've bought a few shares in Intel, AMD, and Sony just to test the waters. After a few days I was up on all 3. Then I saw Vizio was having it's IPO, so I purchased some of that. I was up about 9% after about 4 days. For shits and giggles I bought some AMC and Dogecoin as well. I'm in it mostly for the long game. I just want to buy and sit on stock. Then I read everyone says Palantir is a great long term stock and I read up on them and thought they have a bright future, so I bought some of that. I'm down on them, but going to hold for a long time. My question is, is buying a little bit of stock here and there, mostly in just industries that interest me and in ""stable and reliable"" companies only in dips, and holding for a long time viable? Or should I just save up my money and buy large amounts in one stock at a time? Thanks."

03/30/2021,stocks,"Buying a little bit at a time is totally fine and often advised, especially if it’s on a regular schedule, but buying just industries that interest you can lead to a lack of diversification that will increase your risk. Individual stock picking is also inherently risky. Consider buying into a market-wide fund like VT."
03/30/2021,stocks,You're doing it wrong!  No offense.  You want to invest in an index fund.  VTI Total Market etf is the way to go.
03/30/2021,stocks,"Before you go HAM on individual stocks, I recommend buying index-tracking ETFs and some thematic ETFs FIRST. Make these the core of your portfolio as you will get the most consistent annual returns on these over the long run.

Then, using your fun money, make your stock picks. You will make some bad choices and good choices, but it's fun to do the research and own shares of companies you believe in. But it's not likely to return as well as index funds over a 20 or 30 year period.

Some random broad market ETFs to look into. These are not necessarily endorsements by me as everyone will have different picks based on their likes and strategies, but just for example:

VO -- Vanguard mid-cap companies  
SPY -- S&P 500 trust  
QQQ -- Invesco Nasdaq 100 tracker  
SCHB -- Schwab U.S. broad market  
SCHX -- Schwab large-cap companies

Some examples of thematic ETFs:

FINX -- financial technology  
ARKW -- Ark Invest next-gen internet companies  
ITA -- iShares aerospace & defense  
BETZ -- sports betting and gaming (gambling)

Just examples of the types of funds to look into to give yourself broad exposure to a variety of markets and thousands of companies without the risk of picking winners and losers.

Perceptive readers may recognize my advice as being straight out of A Random Walk Down Wall Street by Burton Malkiel. Should be required reading!"
03/30/2021,stocks,There is some really good advice in this thread.
03/30/2021,stocks,"No, at the rate you're going, you're creating an individualized ETF.  I went this route and realized it's not a good strategy.  There will come a time when there's too many companies to manage, and the ones that grow will be stunted by the ones that are failing.  Like I said, you're going a path of a personalized ETF.

If you're going this route, you're better off looking into 3-4 index or ETF, putting a bulk of your money there, and then selecting a 2-4 companies you really really like that you think will grow in 5-10 years, and building a substantial foundation into those.  Here and there you can buy a few more of other companies, but you shouldn't gravitate too much beyond your core.  

In your case, you can invest small amounts and DCA over time.  Even if you cant afford Amazon at 3K, you can still buy fractional shares (in response to your ""saving a lot of money and making a big purchase.)"
03/30/2021,stocks,Thanks everyone for the information. I'll narrow down my individual stocks to only a few and I'll make ETFs my main focus.
03/30/2021,stocks,"I think you are starting off ok. Beware of fad investing. Keep investing in those same dependable value stocks when the price is right. Growth stocks can pay off but they can be a total loss, too, so do your homework. Don't quit!"
03/30/2021,stocks,"When I was getting started I did much the same thing. One thing I would advise is looking at what the professional advisors have to say. I'd pick a company I knew (or sometimes just run a screener for buy ratings) and see how many analysts rated it buy/hold/sell.  If you wind up looking at something and the analysts are mostly in agreement, it's a pretty good bet that it'll do well, and vice versa.  

In the absence of being able to analyze on your own, look to expert advice."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Other people have already said ETFs but I'd like to explain something that's missing - if you aren't actually evaluating the companies for expected growth and price targets to exit them at then you're not going to have any good indication of the best time to exit a stock. You want to limit the extent to which you exit just before big rises or to which you exit after a stock was found to be overvalued and dropped.

Do the ETFs for general growth like people said but if you're still interested in some level of risk then make two or three mental slots in your head for companies that you will invest in after doing due diligence. Personally evaluate them based on their financials, their potential for growth, the experience and success of their executives, etc. No dogecoin, no AMC, no Palantir, unless/until you've evaluated those for yourself and you are satisfied that there is a real thesis for them and that you are going to be able to tell what price to exit at"
03/30/2021,stocks,"No.   You're doing this wrong IMO and there's alot of boring advice from guys who shouldnt be trading and should just throw their $ into $SPY because they probably wont beat it.. Learn SOME fundamental and technical analysis. Education it's free with Prof. Google.  Don't over diversify. Find your companies that have potential for growth and a sound balance sheet, and preferably with healthy volatility such as cyclicals. If you're in for the long game buy all the dips. Once you get an understanding of fluctuations over days/weeks/months/years you'll be better at predicting highs and low.  At that point have an entry and exit strategy. But what do i know I've only made 6x profit on original investment and 130% YTD. You cannot control the market,  just your risk/reward tolerance.  

I started off like you,  having alittle bit of money in alot of stocks and had virtually no gains my first year. Good luck!"
03/30/2021,stocks,"I saw the responses and you’re probably interested in converting your 1000$ into 10K and one day 100K or more 

Don’t waste your time with ETFs. Spot trends in stocks and options and the returns can be parabolic - can also go the other way 

Your first target is how to double your money. 

Bring another 1000 dollar into another brokerage and pick up stocks that are too cheap at the moment"
03/30/2021,stocks,"Most of us have been there. 

Invest in companies you use daily. 

Welcome"
03/30/2021,stocks,Just start with a good ETF.
03/30/2021,stocks,"This is exactly me right now. Just starting, just learning. While I am following the great /stocks sages advice of reading the learner links I still wanted to have a little play in the mean time. Just to get a feel, to learn to watch red days and not panic. To learn not to watch that stock app every 5 minutes. One of the first things I did learn lurking in /Stocks is this is not just financial stress, it's also psychological.    
    
So being small time and wanting to avoid as many commision's as possible I signed up to eToro (took 30+ days to validate, not 3 pffft). Took £1k from an  unexpected bonus I didn't budget for and can afford to loose (This is still a lot of money for me, so 'can loose' is relative to the 'unexpected' part) and threw it into the App. Currently only half of this is allocated. Dipping my toe so to speak.    
My aim at the moment/next few months? Try to make more than my bank account will give me and to learn. After that I'll want to be doing more. At that point I'll want to be doing my own DD's and looking hard at ETF's etc aswell. I want to be able to look at sites like Macroaxis and have it all make sense, not just the jist of it.    
    
Where am I now?    
    
A bunch of shares in SNX.  - Why? I work for them and believe in the company. I'm not high level, just shop-floor and thankfully have no insider info. I like how the company is run, I like the commitment from those around me. In at sub 100, I've seen nothing but green.    
    
A bunch in RR.L -  Again a company I like and believe in. In at sub 106, this is a long play. A lot of their income comes from flight time, once things start to normalize I expect his to rise.    
    
A couple in CRSR - I like and always have liked their product. In at sub 32. No DD, pure emotion buy...cuz it was cheap :)    
    
Couple in CCL - Total gamble, in at sub 24. (Missed the 'boat' on this one due to eToro validation time, watched it rise 40% in my virtual account). No logic to this, but people are not logical so meh. This will either Phoenix or go Bankrupt. This one was a lesson I chose to teach myself about FOMO.    
    
Couple in BB - I believe this company has a future, and its defo a long play. In a bit high, just over 11. This will probably settle about 9 (+- .50) in my uneducated opinion. If it gets to 8.5 i'll get a few more to even me out then sit on it for a year.    
    
A few in PLTR - In at 26, just before the tech dive. A lesson in meme stock learnt. Uneducated guess will settle above 20, prob 21-22. No friggin idea what to do with it now.    
    
After the last few weeks of stocks bouncing around my account has pretty much been about the -3% mark. Worst day -4%, currently at -2%. I see that as OK considering.    
    
Lessons learnt: The three stocks I liked and believed in did well and kept me up. The three meme stocks thrashed me."
03/30/2021,stocks,Message me
03/30/2021,stocks,Don’t get a boat
03/30/2021,stocks,"Ah yes, I love reading huge blocks of Text"
03/30/2021,stocks,Just put it into an S&P 500 index and don’t look at it. Add a little bit (5-10% of your pay check if possible) every pay cycle.
03/30/2021,stocks,"I'd say VTI is better.  International is a waste of time.  Even John Bogle said ""international is not needed""."
03/30/2021,stocks,"No offense taken, just trying to learn."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Just VTI, not multiple etfs."
03/30/2021,stocks,"There's so many index's and ETFs that I wouldn't even know where to start. Just feels like it would take forever to get through a bunch to see what it has, and then research everything in it."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Works when it works but 90% of people who trade this way lose money. 99.9% of noobs like OP who trade this way lose money.

Easy to say, difficult to practice doesn't begin to describe it."
03/30/2021,stocks,What about hoes?
03/30/2021,stocks,"True, but he also said that people shouldn’t necessarily listen to him about that. International and US have traded off in different decades as to which does better. Holding only US seems like a bet rooted in performance-chasing."
03/30/2021,stocks,Wasn’t it jack boggle in case anyone looks him up
03/30/2021,stocks,"Yeah.  VTI is the Vanguard Total Market etf. I use FSKAX at Fidelity, which is basically the same. Very low cost.  Just keep adding money.  Don't worry about share price.  Just keep adding, especially if the market dives 10 to 20%!

When the market recovers you'll accrue more money.  You really have to think long term.  Think 5 or 10 years from now.

The money you put in will more than likely be more in 5 more years.  You won't get that in a savings account!"
03/30/2021,stocks,Take this person's advice and don't do stock picking until you've carefully thought about your investments and can talk at length about them. A good idea and what you think is a good idea is the difference between making money and losing it.
03/30/2021,stocks,"well, VTI plus an international index fund for diversification"
03/30/2021,stocks,"And thats exactly why I think an ETF or index fits your needs, because if youre unwilling to look through a listing of the companies that are easy to access, youre probably not doing a thorough enough due diligence on the companies youre purchasing.  Youre gambling and not making a well informed decision.  Investing in stocks require a well informed decision and in my opinion youre barely even scratching the surface of research.  Youre probably not even sure where to begin.  All thats okay, youre starting somewhere, but why jump in the tank when you dont even know how to swim? Sure you may know how to float, but the market isnt exactly stable.

Also, if youre in the USA, open a roth or ira first. I dont suggest trading in one, but you can trade in there if so desired.  This is for tax purposes and you should have an ira or roth before a brokerage.  (In case you dont have one)"
03/30/2021,stocks,"VTI dude ..... VTI!  Make it simple! 

VTI is the TOTAL MARKET.

 Just keep adding money each week or month.  Done!  Simple! :)

Don't touch it and keep adding to it.  In 10 years you'll have a nice chunk of change hopefully."
03/30/2021,stocks,There’s way more individual stocks then ETFs and indexes. It’s seems like picking stocks would be harder then ETFs. If you like tech then pick a tech heavy ETF or if you want blue chip companies go with s&p mini.  Imasundevil_man listed some good ones. The ETFs have already done the research and picks good companies.
03/30/2021,stocks,Depends on individual skill
03/30/2021,stocks,"Well is it better to go with an asset that has a proven track record of performance or underperformance? 

 I'll take the prior."
03/30/2021,stocks,"The best way to put it is at some point youre going to want to know what sony, amd, intel, amd, vizio, and others you buy does during the annual report, and if you continue buying more companies, how are you going to monitor them all? If you dont intend to monitor them, you gotta ask yourself it thats smart investing.

Also, not just that, but it sounds like youre buying 2-10 shares of a company and maybe moving on, just to get your feet wet, and then moving on to more companies thinking its a long term play.  Like I said, I did this as a rookie. I dont suggest it, but its your money. I want to sell my rookie mistake, but at this point I may just ride it out. Maybe someone else can correct me on why Im wrong, but so far ""diversify"" doesnt mean to watch 15 different companies with 1000 bucks. You wont get rich off of it, youre really not doing much more than an index fund, and youre adding to the headache (researching, drama, etc.)"
03/30/2021,stocks,"I think luck is the majority of it. You can be a hot hand for a while but almost no one can beat the market consistently, and almost none over decades. Study after study of fund manager performance has reached this conclusion."
03/30/2021,stocks,"And you expect someone beginning to have that skill?  Why do you think people aren't suggesting options yet to a novice?  Some have succeed, many have failed and its not a game for rookies."
03/30/2021,stocks,Past performance is not indicative of future results.
03/30/2021,stocks,"Winners rotate 


https://imgur.com/8LCgfsS"
03/30/2021,stocks,So is past underperformance indicative of future outperformance then?  Lol
03/30/2021,stocks,"Are you saying msft aapl won't be winners going forward?  I guess most index funds will have to rotate them out of their overweight positions and install some random international companies that no one's ever heard of then lol.

I'll take my chances."
03/30/2021,stocks,Past performance is not indicative of future results.
2021-03-30 05:22:27,stocks,"Those of you that participate in a company ESPP plan, how have you been managing your portfolio? Everywhere I've read online strongly advises against holding too big of a position in your own company and I understand why.  I've read a lot of articles that prefer to just sell after the restrictions period ends and secure the discount.  

I've been on my ESPP plan for 3 years now (3 month restriction, 15% discount).  Recently, the price has done well through investments/ divestments.  I think they're a blue chip and a relative top player in their field, and believe there's still a little more room to grow.  However, the value from my ESPP plan easily is about 40-65% of my portfolio (not including my 401K.)  My initial plan was to purchase and sell in 3 years OR just keep buying (up or down) and dealing with it later.  Now that the price has gone up and my 3 years are up, I'm trying to decide when to sell.  I have about 320 shares at about ~88.  It's not a huge position, but sizeable enough to think about.  Alternatively, I did think about just riding it out until retirement along with the dividends, but that's definitely risky.  

How have you guys been managing or how did you manage your ESPP plan?  What percentage of your portfolio is/ was it before you sold."
03/30/2021,stocks,"My company allows for up to usd 150,000$ of stock purchase per month at 10% discount after holding for a year. 

My though was to find a loan cheap enough, say 2-3% for 150k and then find the stock and short it for a 12 month period, hopefully not costing too much to borrow the stock, and then pocket the arbitrage. Say if I can get 5% after cost of borrowing on 150,000. That’s like 7.5k profit. Per month. Rinse and repeat. 

I think I’d get fired though. So I’m not doing this."
03/30/2021,stocks,"I rode mine out for years.  It is by far my biggest holding. It is 2/3 of my individual stock portfolio. It is not as risky as it sounds, especially if you're with a blue chip. You get your 15%, and you end up dollar cost averaging. I sell some every year, but I always buy more than I sell. Make sure you keep it long enough that it considered a long term gain. Just keep selling your oldest ones first."
03/30/2021,stocks,"My plan was always to sell at 20% over buy in, but I never had much long term faith in the companies I worked for. 

However, if they’re good dividend stocks that you believe in there’s no problem with having them take up a larger portion of your portfolio. Educate yourself in options and sell OTM covered calls to generate extra income, set a stop loss point at which to sell and hold true to it."
03/30/2021,stocks,"I do not participate in an ESPP other than buying and immediately selling. This company already controls your paycheck, its IMO being too tied to one horse to also invest in them. Unless you are pre IPO and getting actual equity."
03/30/2021,stocks,"I sell as soon as my shares qualify, keeping it around 20% of my 401k."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Option grants I get as part of my stock compensation I wait a year (for taxes) then “exercise and sell” harvesting the free $, which I put in my self directed investing account. 

Stock grants I keep no no matter how many they give me. They’re a blue chip that pays a dividend so why not? 😃"
03/30/2021,stocks,"To piggy back off this, what happens if your company is bought off?  In another words, even though you have no plans to sell, you must sell your shares (ie. private company taking it private), so recently purchased ESPP become short term sale and thus penalized as such??  Or is there a provision for this and thus the sale is considered as “long term?”"
03/30/2021,stocks,"For me, it depends on the company. One time, I worked for a company where the stock options were peanuts. But, i didn't believe in the product and just felt it wasn't going to make any traction.  


Then, i worked for a blue chip one time where they gave me a very good discount and I stayed there for 2 years. I put as much as I possibly could and am VERY happy with that stock. But, i knew it was going to take off."
03/30/2021,stocks,I almost always sell immediately because I do not believe in investing too much in the company I work for. Every once in a while I have kept it longer if I thought it was undervalued for some reason.
03/30/2021,stocks,"Enron used to be a blue chip company as well.. The thing with having your portfolio heavily invested in the company you work for is not helping with the diversification of your portfolio. For example (hypothetically), if you lose your job when there's a recession, you firstly lose your income stream and secondly you lose your portfolio value as well since you will have to sell at a low price. What if the company goes bankrupt? I know the chances might be low, but they're not 0.

I'm not saying sell all your shares, because management may not like that, but don't be fully invested in your company because then your investments/finances would be too concentrated."
03/30/2021,stocks,Enron was in business 15 years. That's not Blue chip. I also said individual stocks. Yes most your  money should be in EFTs. Not individual stocks.
2021-03-30 05:18:00,stocks,"Question About Candlesticks - What interval/time chunk to use? Are signals different or the same? Hey guys I started learning more about candlesticks and how they are used.

I found a lot of reading on bullish and bearish patterns.

What I’m confused about though is intervals/time chunks.

A lot of the literature on patterns just talks about candlesticks which are calculated daily.

One candlestick = 1 trade day.

I can see that software tends to let you chose the intervals you want. So you could have candles for a 5 minute chunk etc.

Are the bullish and bearish signals the same regardless of if you’re looking at 5 minute candles vs 1 day candles?

Or are there different patterns?

Also, for the patterns where the candles are for say like 5 minute intervals, are the top and bottom of the “wick” the high and low during those 5 minutes and the top and bottom of the thick part the start and finish of those 5 minutes?

Help! Lol"

03/30/2021,stocks,"Yes your example in the last paragraph is correct. 

As for time frame select the time frame that fits your plan to hold the stock.

For stocks I am going to hold for a few days I tend to use the four hour candles for a pattern, I’ll look at a triple MA on the daily and make an entry using bol on the minute."
03/30/2021,stocks,Patterns are patterns regardless of your time frame.  If you're a day trader you would use 1-min or 5-min candlesticks; if you're a long-term trader you could use weekly candles.  But an ascending wedge is an ascending wedge is an ascending wedge.
03/30/2021,stocks,Google says 3 days.  I got print outs to remind me laying everywhere. Welcome to the jungle
03/30/2021,stocks,"I use 4 hour candles and sometimes 1 hour candles depending on if there's a pattern or to define trend lines better. 

5 minutes isnt really enough to certainly define a change in trend or trajectory, its useful for daytrading or if you're trying to trade a channel, but days are better for clear bull/bear signals. The wicks are the highest and lowest price reached in that 5 minute interval."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Time frame on your candles or charts depends on your trading time frame. Longer the time you hold a position the longer the chart time frame.

Day trading or weekly look at 1d, 4h, 1h, 15min. 15m, 5m and 3m for intraday trading.  The patterns are the same i.e.. a Doji is a Doji but they are giving you signals for different time frames. The longer the time frame the stronger the signal for overall market direction. Yes to the last paragraph of your question."

2021-03-30 04:59:08,stocks,"CHWY earnings play? Last earning call for PINS and 🚀, I was fairly confident in their earnings and they beat. Now the next discussion is CHWY. I am confident they will beat tomorrow when their earnings are released but I have no clue how to play this. It's down 50% from its recent high. Will it still continue to trend with other tech, growth and stay at home plays, or will it likely pop on earnings release? 

I ordered from Amazon before the pandemic for convenience and while I don't own a pet, I see Chewy boxes outside at most neighbors houses and don't see why anyone would go back to a store once we're fully reopened and buy stuff? It's all about convenience. Thoughts?"

My two cents."
03/30/2021,stocks,"The guy who made chewy what it is left the building. As it's been posted shelters are getting stuffed with COVID pets and everyone is about to be hard up for cash.

2021-03-30 04:37:47,stocks,"Foreign currency advice. 
I am having difficulty understanding the basics of a long vs short position in trading foreign currencies. I know you should take a long position if you expect the currency to rise, and a short position if you expect the currency to fall. The problem is calculating the profit. For example, the British pound appreciated relative to US currency from January 19 to March 16. On January 19 the exchange rate was 1.3644 GBP/USD. On March 16, the exchange rate was 1.3901 GBP/USD. The Pound obviously got stronger. I have to “invest” $100,000 USD into GBP. This means I could buy 73,292.29 pounds on January 19 and sell for 71,937.27 on March 16. Does this mean I have a profit of 1,355.02 pounds? When I convert this back to USD, the profit should be $974.76 (1,355.02 pounds divided by the current exchange rate of 1.3901). Also, if I took a short position it would be a loss of $974.76? Any help would be appreciated. Thanks"
03/30/2021,stocks,"Was just about to answer you this on WSB. If the pound is worth 1.3644 per dollar and you are changing $100,000 to pounds, then do $100,000 divided by 1.3644. You get $73,292.29.

Time to change that back to dollars, this time you take your $73,282.29 and multiply by the new rate of 1.3901, which gives you more than $100,000 in US funds. 

Your profit in US dollars is the difference. It will be the same as exchange rate 2 divided by exchange rate 1, then that figure multiplied by the initial investment.

For the profit in sterling just multiply the value of pounds by the ratio of exchange rate 2/exchange rate 1

Hope this is what you were looking for"
03/30/2021,stocks,"I'm no forex expert, but I'm pretty sure in your scenario the pound actually weakened against the USD. If yesterday it only cost me 1.36 pound to get a dollar and today it cost me 1.39 pound, then the dollar has strengthened and my pound doesn't buy as many dollars, no?

I know this isn't super pertinent to the question, but you've got me second guessing myself on how forex works lol"
03/30/2021,stocks,1.3901 GBP/USD doesn’t mean 1.3901 gbp to each 1 USD—it means the opposite—-it takes 1.3901 USD to buy/sell each GBP

2021-03-30 03:53:05,stocks,"Thoughts on $PRNT? Investment objective: The Fund seeks to provide investment results that closely correspond to the performance of the Total 3D-Printing Index. The Fund normally invests at least 80% of its total assets in securities that are included in the Index, designed to track the price movements of stocks of companies involved in the 3D printing industry.

I've been reading for a few years now how industrial applications of 3D printing are expected to explode, so I was naturally pretty excited to read about it. But it seems overpriced by a pretty wide margin.

\- P/E is 39 (asset class median 22)

\- P/B is 5.7 (asset class median 2.5)

\- P/S is 3.6 (asset class median 1.87)

And consider that these figures are based on a period in which sales, I would assume, were a bit down given that industrial output wasn't what it's been in years past.

Don't get me wrong, there is absolutely such a thing as justifiably high figures in each of these categories, but there is also such a thing as a solid company/industry being overvalued because investors have priced in gains beyond what are reasonable to expect.

My other concern is that INDUSTRIAL applications of 3D printing are set to boom but I don't know what the trajectory for personal printing is supposed to be, and this ETF could be weighed down my potentially lagging growth in that area."

But I don’t see my top pick mentioned a lot: Simon Property Group (SPG). I see this as a huge play to capitalize on the change in retail behavior going forward. I think there is a lot of pent up demand for social and in person shopping experiences. People miss social experiences, an element of public gatherings and things like movie theatres. But a movie theatre kinda sucks as a stand-alone business. So in the future I see a combined experience where people go to one location for things like movies, Dave and busters or other arcades/activities, shopping and restaurants. This requires excellent properties in key locations. Aka SPG. I think this will be a huge reopening stock with at least a 20% upside and room to increase their dividend to precovid levels"

Though, I still need to look up the reason for that drop from late-Nov 2019 to late-Jan 2020. I'm guessing it was related to news of further delays in the 737 Max recert at the time, as BA fell 13% over that time frame as well."

Suppose they announce new plans of expansion assuming perfect information. This new expansion will result in 50% increase in all future revenue streams per year. 

This increases the share value by 50%. Now trading at $15. 

Suppose now the day actually comes where the plans have materialised and annual revenue is reported at exactly 50% increase. Perfectly in line with expectations. 

How would the market react to this? 

In a perfect world with no uncertainty it wouldn’t react at all. However in an imperfect world the announcement of the expansion wouldn’t have increased the share value by 50% due to uncertainties such as not meeting expectations, plans falling through etc. 

The overall question is when something is ‘priced in’, how do you actually measure how much of it is priced in?"

2. Feasibility - a statement of expansion in dish soap is very different from a statement of expansion in the rocket ship market. No one even knows if people in Albania want rocket ships. They definitely buy soap though. 

3. Difficulty - I don’t need to define the word “difficulty” but just keep in mind that this includes the quality of management.

03/30/2021,stocks,"When annual revenue is reported, they will also report expectations for the coming reporting period.

If the company’s projections are higher or lower than what wall st’s projections are, then wall st will act accordingly. 

If Wall St senses the market as a whole is placing a higher premium on future returns based on how reliable the company is at hitting its mark, then wall st will decide that maybe, due to demand, it’s earnings warrant a share price of $15.50, not $15. 

Then some other analyst at wall st will publish a piece saying the market is actually valuing the returns more highly, but isn’t considering future growth appropriately, so there’s more room to run. 

Then another analyst says present and future growth are only worth $15 on the dot, so the current fervor that pushed it up to $15.50 is unwarranted. 

Then some ape on WSB pushes some BS version of “DD” saying that the hedgies have piled on because $15.50 is too high, so people buy. Even though short interest is at a pedestrian 12%. Apes gonna ape. 

Then wall st decides that since demand remains strong, the premium for the reliable returns makes the stock now worth $16 instead of $15.50.

03/30/2021,stocks,"Priced in is very subjective and it can be seen from two perspectives: the future cash flows, the discount rate, which is a proxy for the risk of investing in the company, and the growth rate. To determine whether something is priced in, you have to do a reverse DCF i.e. what the implied growth rate is when you fix the expected cash flows/discount rate, or the implied discount rate when you fix the growth rate/expected cash flows.

As an example, say a regulator announces that they are looking into Company A for Violation X. Typically, when a company breaks this specific regulation, they are typically fined $1 billion. Market participants start to assign probabilities on different amounts. When the regulator announces this, the market cap of Company A may drop by $1 billion, by more or by less.

Your job is to determine what the expected fine will be (say you expect $1 billion); if the price drops more than $1 billion, you can say that the fine is 'priced in'. If you have a strong conviction on your estimate, then there is an additional return you can generate if you invest at that price if your estimate is correct. If the market cap drops less than $1 billion, you might say that the fine is 'not priced in' and you won't buy at these prices.

Note that in this example, it's a one-off event and it's much simpler to visualise, but irl market participants have assumptions on trends, future cash flows, growth rates, discount rates etc. which all change dynamically as the market moves forward."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Awfully good question. Made me think what does ""priced in"" mean. I don't think it is a mathematical concept. You should always assume all public information is priced in. Of course different people may assign different values to future scenarios.

Most importantly, ""priced in"" is a snappy answer. Suppose your friend comes to you and says ""Company X announced Y. This is a must-buy-stocks situation, isn't it?"". You might answer to him: ""OK. So you put a bigger value to these positive news than the rest of market wisdom, and you think your judgement for this situation is superior to all the professional analysis that has already handled the news. Don't be offended when I say that your 30 second intuition probably comes second to all investment professionals and retail traders combined."" But that is an awfully long thing to say. So you just answer: ""Nope. Priced in."""

That being said VIAC is very oversold right now and just closed a share offering for almost double what the stock is priced at now so I think it will bounce in the short-term. A lot of times you will see a big, violent bounce after something sells off this hard (especially since the sell-off was caused by a margin call on a large shareholder - essentially an unlikely to be repeated event). It should see the 60’s again very soon. I would sell it there and look again in 6-12 months once this rotation into cyclicals and value stocks has gotten a little farther into its move. I wouldn’t be surprised if we see a bounce into the 60’s or 70’s and then a steady dip into the low 40s or even 30s if tech continues to show weakness."

Panasonic: Poor sales growth, but overall good looking chart, IMO they seem to be overvalued at the moment.

Maybe the current stock price has some of this potential already factored in though? For me I’d probably wait for a dip before I bought in. 

Toyota: Great looking chart, excellent sales growth, P/E, P/S, PEG, balance sheet looks attractive. Beats earnings consistently, over and over. Definitely something I’d consider buying for a safe long term hold. Very interesting to see if anything comes of the Tesla/Toyota rumors though, could be a major catalyst."

As far as setting a price a target, well I suck at that. I always hold longer than I should lol. Overall you want to research as much about the company as you can.

2021-03-30 02:31:51,stocks,"Replace ARKQ with FIDU&ROBO? Hi wonderful ppl,

I’m wondering if it starts to make sense to swap out ARKQ with two slightly lower return but much lower risk sector ETFs.

I liked ARKQ bcoz it’s inclusive of both growth stars (read TESLA) and some staple ones with ambitions to rock, like Deere, Komatsu and Nvidia. And of course it brings in 3D, proto and Autodesk.

But ROBO + FIDU can possibly do the same combo, with a lower rate. FIDU includes 3M, Deere, CAT, Honeywell, etc. 

Thoughts?"
03/30/2021,stocks,"My personal preference between the two choices would be the FIDU/ROBO combination as I tend toward less concentrated ETFs if I can. You obviously won't get a 1:1 replication of what ARKQ aims for but I think the approximation of the theme is decent enough. Just keep in mind with FIDU you are going to get a lot of holdings uncorrelared with your strategy in the lower end of the basket.

One other robotics ETF to look into, if you haven't, is ROBO's rival, BOTZ. Both of these were quite popular on Reddit a couple years ago  I haven't kept up with them but do know the holdings are all bit different. BOTZ has slightly lower fees but ROBO has performed a little better it seems."

Therefore ETFs such as ICLN and PBW (of which I owned both at some point in the recent past), just aggravate this situation by investing broadly according to market cap, not helping anyone really, let alone their investors, in weeding out garbage from potential winners. And we can also talk about what's a winner company vs. what's a winner stock/investment and how the two might be disconnected, but that's for another story.

We can zoom out of this and start talking about Vanguard and Blackrock who are forced to buy shit companies just because they are in an index but that's veering offtopic in this discussion - however it does apply to ICLN, PBW and others.

Energy is tough to invest in, and picking winners even more so, especially for players who do large-scale projects."

Later ---The next major UN climate meeting is now slated for November 2021 in Glasgow, Scotland, where countries — including the US — are expected to announce new, more ambitious plans to slash their emissions over the next decade.

03/30/2021,stocks,what ETF comparison tool do you use?
03/30/2021,stocks,"👍🍻 I'm convinced, buying in tmrw, Cheers to real investing! 🍻"
03/30/2021,stocks,Exactly people should hold for at least a yr before complaining. And like you said you had a chance to exit up 50% in less then a yr
03/30/2021,stocks,Have you seen what people paid in 2000? I think it was over a thousand dollars
03/30/2021,stocks,Plenty of people in the rate my portfolio threads would say they were 50% tesla and 50% ARK... I wonder how they're doing now.
03/30/2021,stocks,"The lesson we learn from that is, that hearing from a company too much is a sign that it's too late to invest."
03/30/2021,stocks,"There's probably some hype hangover on most renewable energy stocks. Still holding my individual stocks in the sector, might buy more as they're on sale."
03/30/2021,stocks,"It's literally the shoe shiner story. I have friends that will throw money at any ticker I tell them to. Hype is through the roof along with retail investing. I think GME was the final catalyst to big players taking profits while little guys jumped on the first train they could get on. GME already exploded and introduced millions of people to investing. Many of those people thinking they missed the boat on GME and looking elsewhere. I'm sure a substantial amount of that money went towards ICLN and ARK. If you spend all your time on reddit, you won't even know other etfs exist outside of VOO or SPY. 

Big money has cashed out and moved on to the next play while new retail is left wondering why ark isn't going up 3% everyday anymore. 

I don't have positions in any of these etfs but might buy into ICLN depending on what the rebalancing looks like. It's hard for me to find any reason not to be long green energy but new investors seeing red in overbought industries shouldn't be surprising to anyone. 

If you bought tesla @900 would you be shocked if you saw the current price? I doubt it."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Thank you. I've seen people say this is overvalued and some energy ETFs I looked at look like they hit a peak in January and started going down. Maybe new president hype bubble..

I'll keep looking into QCLN and others aswell."
03/30/2021,stocks,That’s the weird thing about stocks these days

Everyone's also saying stuff like ""told you""."

03/30/2021,stocks,💯 arkk. Holding til I’m 40.
03/30/2021,stocks,"Maybe they did ""told you"" it's just buried at the bottom of a 3 month old post with 300 downvotes. It really is flavor of the week around here. When it starts trending back up people will hop right back up on cathie's dick."
03/30/2021,stocks,as soon as people found out she believed in god it was game over. i’m not sure why..
03/30/2021,stocks,"I didn't say it wouldn't be. Just saying it's been red since it's induction. I'm bullish on ICLN especially at the current price. But if we're talking price history, and we were. The etf has never seen a profit.... yet."
03/30/2021,stocks,Diamond balls.
03/30/2021,stocks,What's that have to do with my comment? I don't care about news that might affect the etf right now. I was simply stating a fact. ICLN has been red since it's existence.
03/30/2021,stocks,Are you 39 now?

2021-03-30 01:46:09,stocks,"Why is $ASO so heavily shorted? Financials look solid. Earnings tomorrow. Academy sports $ASO is nearly 40% float shorted. I reviewed all the financials and something is not adding up. They have positive revenue and net income and both have increased the last two quarters year over year. Their net profit margin is up as well as their operating income. Looks very undervalued in my opinion, and yet it is being shorted like crazy, any ideas why? 

They sell guns, ammo and outdoor equipment, all stuff that has seen a boom the past year due to the tense political atmosphere and pandemic. I picked up some shares this morning and hoping for some good earning call results tomorrow. 

This is not financial advice, just my opinion."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Their balance sheet is upside down. Tangible book is negative. Their earnings have historically been spotty, as has their revenue growth. It looks like they increased revenue by taking on large amounts of debt.

1.5B of goodwill for a company with a market cap of 2.2B is always suspect.

Overall, they seem like an OK company to me. Shorts could just be blindly betting against retail. That seems to be a popular thing among funds these days.

EDIT: This information is not all correct. See my response further down the chain."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Dick's is, too.

Shorts are betting Covid recovery doesn't include sports equipment.

Edit: and Amazon is drinking their milkshake."
03/30/2021,stocks,They paid off 40% of their debt and just crushed earnings
03/30/2021,stocks,I don’t get it either.
03/30/2021,stocks,I swear just a month a so ago everyone was talking about going long on ASO because everything is opening up. We switching this bud around to the puts? 👀👀
03/30/2021,stocks,"In my opinion investing in arms selling companies is very cyclical and timed around politics. People tend to heavily invest around election times or when there's tons of protests to rack in the short term profit hype of everyone rushing to buy for their safety or fear of further regulation incoming. There could be something else too, but that's just my observation over the last few years"
03/30/2021,stocks,"40 percent short? 

Found my next gme. 

Those fuckers who are short better dump that position fast before I buy in."
03/30/2021,stocks,Been waiting a month for this before buying in. After pltr crsr ans unity lost so much due to lock up expiry
03/30/2021,stocks,40% of their debt has been paid off and their earnings once again are through the roof
03/30/2021,stocks,Then how are their earnings so good? Lol
03/30/2021,stocks,"Sounds like they need some Palantir in their life. Yo, Pete, give em a ring"
03/30/2021,stocks,Funny... I was at a Dicks this past Sunday and the line was through the store. You need to try on most sports equipment before buying. I would never trust Amazon with sporting goods.... But then again I bet list of Dicks revenue is actually from clothing sales.
03/30/2021,stocks,"Sounds like a dumb bet, just kids alone should push these stores up with schools being open again."
03/30/2021,stocks,People bought sports equipment to deal with the pandemic .  So that market my dry up a little
03/30/2021,stocks,"Yeah you might be onto something, are they losing a lot? How much debt are they in?"
03/30/2021,stocks,"I looked at their actual filed statements and I think Yahoo finance just imported wrong because the numbers look a lot better than I stated earlier.

They only have 780M of debt, and their goodwill is only 860M. They have lots of cash and the balance sheet is *not* upside down. I suspect on Yahoo that their long term lease liabilities were being rolled into long term debt.

I don't trust their earnings figures, but I'm too lazy to read to find out where that money is coming from."
03/30/2021,stocks,I think if you listened to the call today you would’ve heard them acknowledge that they aren’t efficient and have lots of figuring out to do.
03/30/2021,stocks,So you're telling me that earnings will get even better as they figure it out then? Sweet
03/30/2021,stocks,"Yes, that’s what I’m saying, if they can figure it out. They seem to think expansion without resolution is how to fix it, and historically speaking that’s how companies fold."
03/30/2021,stocks,Bullish
03/30/2021,stocks,Indeed. But it’s good to look at ASO in a broader light and ask why they went public despite being their size for decades.
03/30/2021,stocks,"Capital raise, outlet for management to sell shares (a primary way they are paid and a way to attract talent), free marketing/attention, etc"
03/30/2021,stocks,Outlet to sell shares - why I bought puts for tomorrow but am also deep in shares.

2021-03-30 01:14:18,stocks,"Best advice I gave myself for reds days. Please keep in mind that for this advice to work you need 3 things. 

1. You need money.

2. You need to have done your DD

3. Since you did your DD you believe in the company. 

Having done step 2 and having money (step 1) and there hasn't been a change in the company and thus you still believe I'm it (step 3). If the stock is red then most likely it's just going through the motions like all stocks do that's when I buy at least 1 share of any 1 of my holdings. Now I did say at least 1. I try to buy a few. Today I picked up a couple of my favorite cannabis stock. If all my stocks are red again I'll buy another. Some of my shares are work pennies so I'll buy those if I don't have much money. 

This way when the stock bounces back I make a profit quicker. 

TLDR: DCA down."
03/30/2021,stocks,Good advice. I would just add that you should also try (!) to anticipate the highest point and sell before it goes down. I don’t want to get too technical but if you buy at the lowest point and sell at the highest point you make profit. I personally do the opposite but that is just preference.
03/30/2021,stocks,🙄 if I hadnt written “try” you would mock me for saying I knew how to time the market. cant do it right for you internet heroes so I stick to my original statement and try (!) to stay polite.
2021-03-30 00:56:01,stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, March 29, 2021 **PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, March 29, 2021**

Stocks traded mixed as market participants continue to digest the effects of the sudden unwinding in equity markets by large hedge funds. After the best session in three weeks on Friday, the Dow Jones (DIA) rose while the Nasdaq (QQQ) and S&P 500 (SPY) pulled back modestly. 

Bloomberg News reported that Archegos Capital Management, managed by Bill Hwang, the ex-head of Tiger Management’s family office and a so-called “Tiger cub” (the name Wall Street gave to protégés of legendary fund manager Julian Robertson), was forced to sell more than $20 billion worth of stocks following a margin call. Hwang was heavily invested in Chinese tech stocks and American media conglomerates Discovery (DISC) and ViacomCBS (VIAC).  Nomura (NMR) and Credit Suisse (CS) warned that their earnings might take a “significant hit” following Archegos Capital’s margin call, with the stock of both banks falling double-digits. A margin call happens when a leveraged account drops below an agreed level. The broker will then require the client to add funds to the account. If it can't, the broker will dump the client's shares and liquidate its holdings to make up the shortfall.

Despite the recent choppiness in the market, there are signs the economy is improving. In 2021, cyclical, energy, financial, and reopening stocks - the under-performers of 2020 - have strongly outperformed tech and high growth stocks, underscoring the sector rotation taking place. Moreover, last week’s unemployment report was a pandemic-low, a sign the labor market is improving as the economy gradually reopens and the vaccine continues to be distributed. 

The United States is set to distribute 3 million doses of the coronavirus vaccine each day. California and New York, two of the hardest-hit states, plan to open vaccinations to all residents 16 and older in the next two weeks. On December 8, before he took office, President Biden promised that his team would help administer 100 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine within his first 100 days in office. The administration has reached that goal, and now set a new goal of 200 million shots administered [in his first 100 days](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/03/25/president-joe-biden-holds-first-press-conference/6984142002/). Before Biden's inauguration on Jan. 20, roughly 20 million doses had been administered (the Pfizer vaccine was approved on December 11, 2021). 

In other news, the Ever Given, the massive container-ship blocking the Suez Canal, a critical artery in global trade, was finally dislodged. The week-long blockade cost roughly $9 billion a day in lost revenue.

2021-03-29 23:58:49,stocks,INTC vs AMD round 1 ... FIGHT! I've been trying to decide which one of these I want to get into. I may end up just splitting it evenly among the two. What are your thoughts? Which has better value? Which has more groth potential? Which has the better product lineup? (I'd like to focus on the stocks but that is hard to do without some product comparison.) Who will benefit most off the shortage? Or the continued boom of digital currencies? Or are you bearish on both? Please don't just say one or the other. Tell me WHY you feel the way you do.
03/30/2021,stocks,"Right now with the shit market the safe play is INTC.  If you holds long, I like AMD.  INTC paid dividends and is more of a boomer play and hasn't been backsliding as much as other techs lately."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Intel is the value. Intel has the more current momentum news and better financials, more cash, 8x the revenue, a sliver of the PE. Is financials scream undervalued. I personally like Intel as a buy up to about 70, maybe 72"
03/30/2021,stocks,"Just look into server market, Intel is over 90% market share now. With that high market share, going up further is hard. Given AMD’s better products, it surely will get more market share. I think at the same time, it will also reduce the profit margin for Intel.  Assuming the new Intel fab will be very successful a few years later, that will not help Intel within next few years.  Also, it is 7ns, how small can process go, given the physics limit ? Long term, it is likely Intel and TSMC is about the same, which means Intel loses dominance. Fab is capital intensive, not guaranteed to be successful, so fab is also Intel’s risk. Also, arm cpus are getting more popular, that is a threat to both AMD and Intel But I think this threat will not be significant in next few years. Given all of that, AMD is better in the next few years."
03/30/2021,stocks,"At these current prices I'd buy them both tbh.

I think Intel has more potential (as in it's undervalued) since it's pretty obvious everyone is super bearish rn and if there are issues with taiwan.

That being said I haven't looked too deeply at either yet. Check out both of their 10Ks and make ur choice that way."
03/30/2021,stocks,Porque no los dos?
03/30/2021,stocks,"TSMC is building a plant in Phoenix also. Wrong side of town, but same metro area.

Ironically it doesn't mean much thet they're there, because most parts anyone makes are shipped to SE Asia for test and packaging."
03/30/2021,stocks,I feel good hearing bearishness about INTC. I buy more every time! Has done very well for me after that 7nm and Apple switching over drops. So much short term chitter and doom & gloom scenarios over INTC
03/30/2021,stocks,"Intel and AMD have had IP sharing agreements for the past 30 years.

It's the actual chip layout and the choice of fabs that made AMD better the past few years. Intel didn't move fast enough and then totally bollixed a while generation of fab tech."
03/30/2021,stocks,"The question is, can Intel's new CEO make the changes necessary to catch up? New fabs are interesting but if you're just making more of the same thing does it really count as change? Again, just playing devil's advocate."
03/30/2021,stocks,"They sound like they're going after TSMC's markets, acting as foundry for fabless designers. But they'll have to succeed at getting the smaller process nodes to work, or they'll get no high-value customers."
2021-03-29 23:55:28,stocks,"Don't stress about red days & your portfolio being down. There's been a lot of negative sentiment thrown around with the recent market volatility. Some people clearly haven't been investing for a longer period of time (neither have I) and others just don't deal well with the bad days. 

My advice is this: during red periods take a look at your investments and see if anything about the company has changed since you started investing. If there is no significant change why would you sell now?

Second, if you have cash on hand try to incrementally buy shares of your highest conviction stocks or buy those who you think have been hit hardest. 

Third, think about the overall state of your portfolio. If it is too focused on one particular section, then consider broadening out your portfolio to different ones so you mitigate risk if you are not comfortable with the current volatility of your portfolio.

The final piece of advice is to just not stare at the graphs everday if you can't handle looking at the red candles. If you are like me and you are investing for the long-term why would you need to look at the graphs every single day?
Just grab the stock chart of any stock for a 5 year period and look at the peaks and downturns in stock price. Some stocks lose like 30 percent from one peak before doubling in price compared to that peak and stockholders who held through that downturn eventually got rewarded for their patience. This doesn't mean that every investment you make will turn out alright in the long-term but panicking and selling at a loss just because the price went down isnt going to make u money especially if nothing about the company changed.

Just today as I write this my portfolio is down about 3 percent while the nasdaq is only down about 0.5 percent. I am not too worried because I am investing with money I don't necessarily need right now and am investing for the long-term so temporary downturns are only opportunities to add to my highest conviction positions. The point is, if you are investing like me theres no need to panic about what is happening now. 

Anyway, I wish u all good gains in the rest of the year and don't stress about the market too much, there is more important stuff in life to worry about and we've got time on our hands.

Edit: 

Also, if you are relatively new to investing and want to learn more, there is alot you can learn just through reading books and practicing doing your own DD on stocks

03/30/2021,stocks,The market only dropped like 0.6% today what is up with all the “don’t worry” posts???
03/30/2021,stocks,lost 4% today. One of my big ones has dropped about 20% in the last week and a half and its been hard to watch. 2 weeks before I was going to hit long term gains and sell them too. Bummer.

03/30/2021,stocks,"“Don’t stress about red months*”

There I fixed it for you"
03/30/2021,stocks,There are a lot of sectors working. If you keep seeing red on all your positions it must mean you might little to no diversification. There have been a lot of winners last few weeks (and a lot of losers). I own both and added to the winners as they run up
03/30/2021,stocks,Hoping for a typical March. It’s been the best month historically.
03/30/2021,stocks,This is why I incorporate dividends. If it goes down my dividends are just getting more value. All about perspective and preparation for any kind of market.

03/30/2021,stocks,"Just don't trade out of your stocks that had losses only to double down on the ones that haven't already dropped.

03/30/2021,stocks,It’s as if some major even happened recently that caused the market to go to shit.... oh yeah now I remember.

03/30/2021,stocks,"I'm at the point that I don't know if my money is better spent on averaging down or diversifying. I'm tech heavy, and of course I also bought at the top.

03/30/2021,stocks,"A lot of the stress comes from most people here do not understand biggest stock bull market driver is from tax cuts/deregulations, way more than universal stimulus and wealth redistribution plans. Business investments, spending and economy grow the most whenever there is expectation that the government will not increase intervention for business and now it's completely opposite. If people follow cathie wood's videos in december as much as her stock trades, she talked about overdone stimulus + tax hike a not good thing for US equities. It drives up inflation quicker than expected, plus leads to valuation reset for US equities and people will be a lot more likely to rotate money out of US stocks.

Bull market isn't likely to end though, it will just be mostly at international market plus real estate. In Europe, Asia where governemnt has more regulations on the economy, usually investors horde real estates. They see that as a safe haven from government policies and I remember seeing redfin saying that the real estate market is still extremely hot and shows no sign of stopping at all."
03/30/2021,stocks,Red days turn to red weeks turn to red months and we will still see coddling posts like these.

03/30/2021,stocks,"Be careful with this, people keep repeating ""holding"", ""zoom-out"" and in the long term stocks will always recover but its not a sure thing, for example if you were bagholding Intel (Yes the leader in processor Intel) since 2000 at the peak of the dotcom bubble you would still be red today, although maybe up thanks to the dividend.

But just to warn you sometimes cutting your losses is also important if the fundamentals on the company you did buy into changes"
03/30/2021,stocks,"you only lose if you sell. Invest only what you can afford to lose. The stock market goes both up and down, I feel like people are forgetting that. We've been in a crazy bull market for years, of course it will correct sometimes, thats just the way it goes."
03/30/2021,stocks,"I was thinking April 1, when Q2 starts"
03/30/2021,stocks,Maybe. But tech won’t recover to the same levels. I’m thinking big tech will recover to maybe 30% of previous highs (the gap) and growth tech will just stay flat or barely recover. Stocks like apple will go up to 125-128 and remain their for years. Stocks like pltr will remain at 21-2 for 5+ years.

03/30/2021,stocks,"Yea, lol... These are probably the ones a few months ago who said ""why not just invest in ark since I'm a long term investor"". Then come crying after a month down.

It's easy to claim to be long when stocks go up. But the real test is when it plunges and bleeds for months or years."
03/30/2021,stocks,the market goes both up and down. if you are investing for the long term you shouldnt even be looking at your holdings very often. Seems like this sub is increasingly more about getting rich quick rather than making actual sound investments. If you are invested in good stocks then a dip like this means nothing in the long term.

03/30/2021,stocks,That's me too. Difference is maybe you still have profits from 2020. Another red day and i'm actually negative all time. FML. Also out of cash to average down. I'm basically hodling now.
03/30/2021,stocks,"Yes it has, for small caps with people trying to make real money. Sure, AAPL isn’t down 30% on it but new traders aren’t touching that because we’re not out here trying to make 8% per year."

03/30/2021,stocks,It hurt a lot. Hurt even more continuing to spend money to average down. But by the bottom picked up some bargains in companies that had been on my WL forever and a few picks that made sense given the pandemic. A year later everything worked out and had my best year.
03/30/2021,stocks,I didn’t open my fidelity account for over a month. When I did I was like oh wow that was crazy but everything was right back where it was before. The usual. Yes I could have sold it but I would have just done something dumb and never timed the bottom anyways.
03/30/2021,stocks,"March 2020 was very easy to see coming if you were even paying the slightest attention to international news. And put options were a dirt cheap hedge at the time.

However, even though I correctly timed the dip and was able to preserve portfolio value in the downturn - I did not foresee how quickly it would recover and got caught unaware when it bounced and kept going up for no reason."
03/30/2021,stocks,It was a quick ripoff compared to these last two months
03/30/2021,stocks,That was much easier to deal with. Shit tanked so fast there was no time to paperhand anything and it was back up in no time.
03/30/2021,stocks,"March 2020 was a very steep sell off within a month, and then a bounce back to previous levels about a month later. For many people, this has been a slow bleed (with occasional faster bleeds) over the course of two months with no end in sight."
03/30/2021,stocks,"SP500 almost reached new high today so I don't think almost every stock has gone down. Certain sectors have gone down from last year's incredible pump for sure, but that's not representative of the whole market. I'd say today was a semi neutral. And it depends on your bag size."
03/30/2021,stocks,I think you mean almost every meme tech stock is down. The broader market is not down.
03/30/2021,stocks,The S&P500 is hovering around all-time high.
03/30/2021,stocks,">It's just that if you have been lurking on the daily discussions and have been taking a look at alot of the recent posts it's been people panicking because we are seeing a lot of red days.

To be fair, the .com bubble didn't crash in a spectacular 1 day event. It lead to a 2 year bear market, with multiple crashes and rallies. Look at the graphs. Lots of red days, with some green days spread in-between. The green days gives hope.

The lesson? Don't base what type of market you are in by the daily, or weekly, or even monthly change. Be prepared for sudden downtrends or sudden uptrends."
03/30/2021,stocks,"I think you make a great point, who cares if it’s repetitive. We’re here to remind people to get rid of fear when investing. Strong hands not emotional sell off loses."

**SMA = (simple moving average) **

*Bullish:*

Price is right around Daily 100 & 200 SMA(we are not overextended right now). 

Weekly 200 SMA is not far below. (Historically has been a support.)

No more tough-on-China Trump

*Bearish:*

Daily 100 SMA about to bear/death cross down the 200 SMA. (Historically has had no significance)

Cathie Woods has been selling AMZN for weeks.

03/30/2021,stocks,Might want to wait for the union vote. Could have a ripple effect
03/30/2021,stocks,Why has Ark been selling Amazon?
03/30/2021,stocks,I think all of tech is a bit inflated due to interest rates rn. Just my opinion so not in a rush. Amzn is the single best stock you could own gun to my head imo.

Therefore they are stifling competition, just by nature of their size and their outsized ability to buy competition and absorb it. They are also hurting the consumer by providing less options, as well as copying their sellers successful products and making Amazon brand knockoffs. 

You’re wrong, and I’m guessing just a shill at this point."

It’s the market at work. I’m not being a shill, I’m explaining to someone who doesn’t understand what they’re talking about that they’re wrong"

I'm new to trading and investing, but I understand enough of the basics, and so far have put together a portfolio of approx. 20 stocks and ETFs. Currently, I am interested in buying stock in ""Company A"" but my trades never go through. Now I understand that for me to buy, there needs to be someone willing to sell, but t*here in lies my confusion.*   


In the app that my brokerage provides, it shows currently that there is 20 lots (ie 2000 stocks) currently up for sale. I find the price aggregable, so I put in a limit order for 10 of those lots. To me this seems straightforward, and purchasing any other stock has always gone through. 

Anyways, I called my brokerage, asking them why I cannot purchase the stock. They told me they don't know why, but that it means the market is not open. There is no news about the stock being halted/suspended, not on the companies website, and not on the brokerages app. What, or who, dictates whether or not I can buy stocks if my account has cash, I am willing to buy at X price, and someone is willing to sell at the same price? Why does my order not constitute as the first volume of the day?"
03/30/2021,stocks,"It could be the case that the other party has entered an 'All or Nothing' order; as the name suggests either all the units are executed or none of the units are executed (your brokerage might not know the details of the order on the other side).

Are you sure the market for the specific stock is open?"
03/30/2021,stocks,"Thanks for sharing that, I didn't think it could be an all-or-nothing order.   
As far as I understand, the market is open. It trades on CVE (Canadian exchange) Would you able to tell me what that means though? I'm not sure if I really understand what it means when a market is open. Cheers!"

My understanding was that the yield goes up people pull money from the stock market and buy the bonds. Naturally, I was expecting an inverse relationship between the two but when I put the two charts together it doesn't look that way.

When the yield dropped the market also dropped. The relation is direct not inverse as I thought.

When the market went down, the Fed brought interest rates down which brought down yields.  This unfortunately has been the core of the Feds playbook ever since.

I'd be interested to see how your correlations changed over time.  Especially pre and post 80s.

2021-03-29 23:41:34,stocks,"Market Commentary (the former Tiger Club member margin called, Volatility in the Markets, TIGR earnings) - 3/29/2021  

Hello investors,

Hope everyone had a great weekend.

Much has happened over the last couple of days and there's a lot to unfold. I'll start off with the last Friday's selloff and end with one final thought about the markets going forward.

Before we do, one thing to keep in mind as we think through what’s happening in the markets is the power of media.

I hear lots of media noise: changing opinions, shifting sentiments and rising calls for market meltdown.

And understandably so. I mean we are going through an ""unprecedented"" period with events that have occurred either very long time ago or never before: the geoplitical tensions between China, Russia, and the U.S., the new bond bear market, coordinated efforts by central banks and fiscal policies to stimulate the economy, the global pandemic recovery, and new flood of retail traders causing disruptions to the markets.

It's not hard to understand that trading these days is more difficult than at any other point in time throughout history.

Even the experts get it wrong all the time.

The smartest economists last year predicted that it would take at least 3-5 years to fully recover from the pandemic damages but the same group of people are predicting end of 2021 or early 2022.

Look at how the derivatives markets have incorrectly predicted fed funds rates in the past. By the end of 2009, the market was predicting the fed funds rate to increase more than 200 bps by 2011 and take a look at what happened.

📷

Remember back in March 2020 when the epidemiologists predicted that we will not have vaccines until 2023 or that 20 to 30% of the entire population will be eradicated?

My point is that in bad or good times, the ""media"", representing a group of experts in the respective fields, can present real hardships for us by playing with our emotions.

My personal strategy in dealing with the volatile market sentiment is to be very open-minded, listen to every word the experts have to say, especially their graphs or evidence-based arguments, form your own opinion, and do not be afraid to change your opinion if you've realized you got it completely wrong.

Doing your independent research and forming your own opinion is critical because by doing so, you will have a higher conviction in your trades.

Having conviction means you are holding onto the trade or stock when the stock falls 80% or not be tempted to sell when the stock triples.

You are able to do that because even if the stock falls 80% you know this company is a great business and you know it will quadruple in the next five years because it’ll grow its earnings and the market will eventually price to that.

If you do not have the conviction, then you’ll be questioning why is the stock falling and you will question your judgment and be tempted to sell.

Now onto today's topic.

I'm sure most of you have heard by now but last Friday, we had a hedge fund getting margin called, triggering large declines in stocks that the fund sold in blocks.

We need to first understand exactly what happened in order to know if this has any real implications for the markets.

This fund is called Archegos Capital, run by ex-Tiger Asia founder Bill Hwang. Tiger Asia is the Asia division of legendary investor Julian Robertson's Tiger Management, and Bill Hwang was one of a select club of analysts (the ""Tiger Club"") trained by Julian Robertson.

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-29/billions-in-secretive-derivatives-at-center-of-archegos-blowup](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-29/billions-in-secretive-derivatives-at-center-of-archegos-blowup)

As a result of forced liquidation, the prime brokers that covered these positions also incurred losses, namely Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Nomura, and Credit Suisse.

With that said, as in any type of news, you have to make your own judgment in terms of whether the news is real or not.

I'm not saying the news is fake but I'm saying that it's probably impossible to know if it's 100% true because no prime broker will disclose the name of their client who just had billions of losses.

Practically speaking, does it matter if it was Archegos or another hedge fund? What matters for us is that some big fund most likely went bad and had to sell a bunch of securities. I wouldn't want to waste a minute trying to figure out which fund this was or whether if this story is actually true.

This fund sold $20 billion worth of shares in total, including ViacomCBS, Discovery, and big Chinese names like Baidu 10mm shares, Tencent 50mm shares, and VIP Shop 32mm shares.

📷📷

📷📷

📷

What exactly triggered them to liquidate all of these positions in such a strong bull market?

I would imagine it's the Chinese names and the growth stock selloff during the recent weeks. Look at their performances recently.

📷📷

📷📷

Viacom CBS went from $100 at intraday top on 3/22 to $64 low on 3/25, roughly 40% drop in less than a week. This came at a time when all other growth stocks were going down in flames, especially the Chinese stocks that took hit due to the rising geopolitical risks.

What does all of this mean for the markets?

Well, a few outcomes are possible in my opinion.

Bearish: full-blown market deleveraging, forcing other funds to liquidate and triggering a downward cycle and stocks to selloff.

Bullish: this turns into another September 2020 event where the Nasdaq sold off 10% caused by Softbank's bulk option purchases and the markets recover like it didn't happen.

Most likely, it'll be somewhere in the middle.

The reason I think it won't turn into a market mayhem is the same one I've been repeatedly mentioning for the past few months. Fed has literally promised a proper market functioning and fiscal spending is none like others in the past.

Look at Fed's dot plot for instance. They're as dovish as an institution can get, expecting to keep rates at 0% through 2023.

📷

Even if the market tumbles and the liquidity dries up, causing the S&P 500 to drop 15%, I have no doubt that the Fed will intervene to calm the markets down, which means the drop will only present incredible opportunities for us as investors.

**I am of the opinion that this is another one of those opportunities to buy into the dip.**

As I mentioned in this memo, I believe that this ""great rotation"" from growth to value will cause short-term stress in the growth names but not in the long run.

The reason is rather simple.

I don't think a company that's growing its top line at 30-40% with 80% gross profit won't care if the market rotates from growth to value stocks.

An e-commerce company will also be marginally impacted by vaccine rollouts. I mean obviously it won't see the pandemic-level of sales growth but I don't think an e-commerce firm that grew its top line at 25% a year pre-pandemic will see its sales growth decrease to single digits simply due to people not staying at their homes all the time.

The point I'm trying to convey is that if you pick great businesses growing rapidly, the market has no choice but to price them to their full earnings potential, whether the market rotates from growth to value.

We may see a lower than expected return but it's still a large return. For instance, if we were expecting Fiverr to trade at 10x P/S by 2025, then we may need to lower that projection to 8x P/S and our overall expected return may change from 250% to 200%. And I don't think you should reconsider investing in a company just because your expected return dropped from 250% to 200%.

On another note, I believe we will experience an inflation level we haven't seen in the last 40 years. The 10-year breakevens are already skyrocketing.

📷

My contention is that gold will be the primary beneficiary of this trend but I'm also open to other ideas to take advantage of the upcoming inflation blowout.

**The second topic I wanted to discuss is TIGR earnings last Friday.**

I posted my thoughts on TIGR on these two memos.

(see the comments)

They reported a very strong earnings report on March 26 pre-market and I was very pleased with the results.

Some of you may have seen that as soon as their earnings were reported, the stock went straight up more than 20% pre-market. After that, the stock opened 14% lower most likely due to the China tensions and Archegos liquidation of Chinese names, and fully recovered from intraday lows by the end of the day.

Given that the business is still in great shape with lots of potential, I view these drops as opportunities and I believe TIGR will thrive in the future.

It's certainly not easy to hold onto the securities that burn your portfolio. That's why everyone has different levels of risk appetite and one person's trading strategy will not work for another.

You have to develop your own system to manage risks. If you are not comfortable with a 40% loss, try limiting your exposure to riskier names or hedging your portfolio through options, as I mentioned in here.

Thank you for reading! I hope this helps and please feel free to leave any comments or feedback.

2021-03-29 23:36:43,stocks,"HOFV has been doing well for me. This is not financial advice. Yadda yadda. 

Do your own due diligence because it will make you a better investor. 

I'm just here to mention this particular stock because it has been consistently green for me and it might be green for you too.

HOFV is Hall of Fame Resorts and Entertainment. They primarily deal with the NFL Hall of Fame in Canton, OH. Recently, they got into the NFT market to start making official NFT's for the NFL and the Hall of Fame. 

Prior to COVID their shares were hovering around $10, but last summer they took a nosedive due to the Pandemic. I bought in right around the $4 a share mark and the shares have been steadily climbing back up to pre COVID levels. The stock has been consistently green since I bought it and now with them rolling out NFL exclusive NFT's I only see growth as NFT's become more popular. 

At worst I expect the stock to at least get back to its steady pre-COVID plateau. I wouldn't YOLO your bank account into it or anything, but maybe buying into the dip while it's climbing wouldn't be the worst move. 

This is not financial advice. Spend your money how you see fit."
03/30/2021,stocks,The HoF is in Canton and has been since the 50’s. So what’s surprising about that?

03/30/2021,stocks,So that means it’s a good business idea to make a resort around it and for you to invest in it? Are you planning to do some family vacations to an NFL resort in Ohio?
03/30/2021,stocks,">This isn’t a long term play.

Can we clarify long? As someone who bought in early February, I actually intended to hold this long term. As a rookie, I’m realizing long is subjective. I cashed out half my position when it went over 100% gains to get my initial investment + profit back. The remaining is sitting at 200% gains. I’ve since day/swing traded it. If it ends up being a  multibagger, I may close my position and buy back when the price “settles”. 

I’m actually long on this stock 1+year but would love to hear why it’s not a long term hold? Former Disney exec CEO, Michael Crawford, DeWine saying legalized sports gambling is inevitable, booking concerts in off-season, casino and resort style “getaway”, it seems NFTs are just a small part of their vision. 

I’m being genuine because I want to hear a bear case lest I suffer from confirmation bias.

03/30/2021,stocks,"For clarification,

Side note: I know this isn't a lot of money to some of you but it's a lot for me, considering i'm a semi-recent college graduate and have quite a bit of financial responsibility in life outside of taking care of myself.

2021-03-29 23:22:38,stocks,"First ETF investment. Volume & cspx vs vusa? (Belgium) Hi guys

I live in Belgium and after my first year of working and saving, i'm looking into starting out with investing. I've spent some months of research and tracking the markets. But is still have some questions i'm struggling with.

\-How do you guys feel about starting out on the s&p500 index? (Or maybe even something like VWRL)

\-After comparing different s&p500's i think CSPX would be the best option for me. Especially with the avoided dividend taxes as it's an acc. However, on my broker account. I can only see the cspx etf available on the euronext amsterdam (amst) market. This means the etf itself is available in EURO currency itself. I think i'm fine with this as it's out currency, but when i look at the average volume it's only around 9000. This seems extremely low to me and i'm not quite sure how to feel about this? For VUSA this would be around 60K. But if i take a look at VUSD it's already at 189K, but this one is listed in usd currency ofcourse. When i look at the US versions like VOO i see volumes way in the millions which makes especially the cspx look quite bad.

\- I'm thinking about starting out with a small starting budget and then continue this as a passive really long term investment. So let's say about 2-300 euro/month budget. However, when using my current broker (which i like to use) i have this 7 euro fee for each transaction up to 2500 as a fixes fee. Wouldn't it be better to just save it up and do the investment itself after about 3 to even 6 months? Would save me quite a lot longer term but i feel like i could be missing out some ""good"" moments because of this.

Thank you very much for helping me out in this new world guys!

Not only that, they then claimed they weren't employees of my broker, so they owed me nothing. Now though, I have watched other customers of this brokerage go into th elocation and get help, why wouldn't they help me?

2021-03-29 21:58:15,stocks,"At this point, do I take the lesson on ARKK and sell it for VOO? I'm new to investing, didn't really do any research into ARKK before I bought it at ATH, so I don't really ""trust"" in my initial research, and at this point I'm unsure if the fund will recover at a rate that would beat just selling my positions in ARKK and buying VOO.

What do you think?"
03/30/2021,stocks,"Some easy told to remember:

You buy the fear, not sell it. You sell the news. Keep your Ark, and add to it. Add some VOO, and VTI if you want also, but don't take the loss. 

When in doubt, zoom out."
03/30/2021,stocks,"“I wanted it at $150. well now it’s $111 and I don’t want it anymore”

dude what are you doing"
03/30/2021,stocks,I’m about to double down on my ARKK. Time to average down and reap the benefits in 5 years!
03/30/2021,stocks,ARKK is heavily invested in Tesla. If you believe the $1500 floor and $3500 ceiling by 2025. It's a no brainer to hold ARKK or buy more. Especially at its current dip.
03/30/2021,stocks,I sold my position in VOO to buy into ARKK. 5 years from now you will wish you had done the same. Stop worrying about the daily volatility of the market. It literally doesn't matter long term.
03/30/2021,stocks,"https://ark-funds.com/wp-content/fundsiteliterature/holdings/ARK_INNOVATION_ETF_ARKK_HOLDINGS.pdf

look at the holdings. I wouldn't sell."
03/30/2021,stocks,"So buy high, sell low, then find another stock to buy high again? Hmmm, you may be on to something..."
03/30/2021,stocks,"I remember someone who took profits off ARKK at 135 while it was drilling 5 weeks ago, and he got attacked on the ARK subreddit for it. It is now at 111. Guess who gets the last laugh?

Sometimes you have to choose to be a paper hander or a bag holder."
03/30/2021,stocks,"ARKK was always going to be more volatile than something like VOO. You should've known that before you invested. It's an innovation fund full of disruptive, fast growing companies. It won't free fall forever, and this tech sell-off won't last forever. Eventually, the market will rotate back into tech. 

With all of that said, I would not have 100% in ARKK. It's not meant to replace a core holding of VOO, but it's fine to own as a swing for the fences position."
03/30/2021,stocks,"I'm not gonna tell you to hold or sell. But you selling right now would be just as impulsive and reactionary as you buying it at ATH with little research.

At it's core ARKK seeks to invest in disrupting technologies that they believe has massive LONG-TERM potential. If you're investing in ARKK, it should be with a very long term horizon. If you like ARKK and it's holdings and it's philosophy, it going down in price should make you happy. When my favourite holdings go down I get excited and buy more. Yes it sucks that you bought at ATH, but this is an investment with a 5 year minimum horizon. And chances are, in 5 years that ATH will seem like nothing. Especially if you average down.

So here's what I will tell you. Do some serious research into ARKK and it's holdings. Make your mind up about if this is an investment you believe in long term. Even if you think it might keep going down short term, that doesn't matter. Try to imagine where these companies will be in 5-10-20 years. If you don't like it, sell. If you like it, buy more.

A lesson you can take from this, aside from properly researching investments before buying, is to not buy into a position all at once. Especially when it's just had a massive run up. Have an idea of how much you want to dedicate to this position, and spread your purchases over time. Sure, you'll never get the perfect low price right at the bottom of the dip, but you'll also never buy the tippity top of the peak. It's easy to see something running up and get FOMO and ""buy before it's too late"". Short term price movements should matter very little with long term investments, but it can be hard to stomach them sometimes."
03/30/2021,stocks,Yes
03/30/2021,stocks,That’s what I’m doing when I’m even again.
03/30/2021,stocks,You know how people joke I buy high and sell low? This would be you if you sold.
03/30/2021,stocks,"Yes, there is nothing wrong with selling and moving to an index fund. If you didn’t have a reason for putting your money in a relatively concentrated fund, then there is no reason to stick with it. Those saying that now is a bad time to sell have not given any compelling reasons. The best time to pursue evidence-based investing was yesterday, but the next best time is today."
03/30/2021,stocks,i would not be doing that myself. i do not think VOO will outperform the rebound i expect to happen with ARKK.
03/30/2021,stocks,it will go back up.... eventually. i'd just sit on on it and sell it when you can break even
03/30/2021,stocks,ARKK is literally a meme stock ETF. I’m not saying buy VOO. But get out of ARKK. At least for now given the current state of the market.
03/30/2021,stocks,I also bought at ath.  It’s a long term investment and I’m holding it long term.  I believe in their core vision and strategy of disruptive tech.
03/30/2021,stocks,"Sell low, buy high"
03/30/2021,stocks,"only time will tell, but selling out now will almost certainly be a mistake. 

ark is based around the premise of ""buy the dip"". they're buying amazing companies like tesla or panantir **now** while the prices are low, so that a few weeks from now when those companies recover and go up by double digit percentages the people who were holding come out way ahead.

just look at the companies in the ETF. now, if you can't handle volatility, ark's not the ETF for you and once it recovers you should consider switching."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Buy high, sell low"
03/30/2021,stocks,"Don’t sell, just hold. Stocks become less risky as their price falls. 
If you’re serious about the companies you invested in through ARKK this is your opportunity to buy more for less."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Volatility goes both ways, and the downside more often than not comes much quicker than the come up.  Averaging down is always an option as well if you have the capital. Good luck just remember this is the beginning of a LOOOONG journey for you investing! :) (VOO is a great choice btw!)"
03/30/2021,stocks,absolutely yes. Don’t even think twice about it
03/30/2021,stocks,"Think of it this way. If you weren’t invested in the market at all and you decide it’s time to start and see the huge drop in ARKK in the past couple months, would you buy?"
03/30/2021,stocks,"Warren Buffet's first rule of trading is ""Never lose money.""

That being said, I tend to say fuck it, take the loss, and buy major dips on companies that have good financials. Went from $2k initial investment to $7k in three months with no other deposits. Had I held on to those initial losses hoping for it to bounce back in January, I'd have ~$1.5k. I don't like to miss out on golden opportunities. 

This is not financial advice, I am a fat man who thinks the Cheeto dust pattern in his beard is telling him to make irrational trades."
03/30/2021,stocks,"I'm also pondering pulling my money out of my speculative plays (ARKG and ICLN) and putting it into a boring value stock like T or VZ instead. Not because those particular holdings are in the red, but because I'm starting to think that chasing speculative growth stocks - an alarming number of which do not even have a product or revenue backing them up - is a fool's errand and not really my thing."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Do me a favor, run a correlation between the 10 year yield (TNX) and ARKK. Results should be interesting, continue pulling that thread...."
03/30/2021,stocks,The situation with ark has happened countless times in the past 50 years.  And yet people still fell for it.  If you fell for arkk you should just stick to index funds.
03/30/2021,stocks,I would assume it won't dip below 75 probably not even below 100. In your case I would be adding more in that range. I am personally not invested in this etf. When it comes to risky stocks I prefer pick single ones.

I think they are onto something with this idea."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Well, as a mild counterpoint, this is not a broad crash like March 2020 during which the Fed put an instant stop to the bearish behavior.  When it's just one segment of the market, especially mostly speculative growth companies that don't affect the present day economy much, the Fed doesn't necessarily need to bail everyone out, and there doesn't have to be a quick bottom.  We could well see another prolonged value > growth cycle just like the 2000s.  ARK's pitch seems to be that innovation alone drives excess returns, but it's not like there wasn't a ton of innovation in the lost decade from 2000-2009, from my point of view the world changed more in that decade than the previous couple decades."

Risky bets made at the wrong time in small specific sectors definitely CAN remain down for a long time or forever.

03/30/2021,stocks,Ark hasn't gotten blown up. They're acutely aware their investment style is volatile and they are ok with that.
03/30/2021,stocks,"Buy red, sell green works until it's all red, all the time, and by the time it goes back to green, you've already lost 50% of the value.

A stock can dive 90% in a year and never recover. Just look at Ford.

I feel like a lot of the people who've entered the market recently have the impression that stocks always go up, with red days just being a temporary set back. But that's only correct if you're talking about a highly diversified index. It's not correct about individual companies or narrow focus funds. Those can, and have, gone to 0."
03/30/2021,stocks,"You mean buy low sell high is a good strategy?

Get out of here with that nonsense!"
03/30/2021,stocks,Yes for sure simplest of simple rules.  I literally have to talk to myself like a father would a son.  And say “boy what the hell are you thinking ?  Sell on a red when your down and the entire market is down .  Do you remember what happened the last time you did that?  Why did you sell when you were up 20% now your down 30% so that a good place to buy.  After having a few of those conversations maybe even several in an hour I can almost always walk away.  Some days it’s really hard.
03/30/2021,stocks,"I am glad I did sell my NIO, QCOM when they started dipping it did save me more loss as it seems I did buy almost at an ATH, I didn't with my ARKK tho"
03/30/2021,stocks,"If you think arkk is going to go back up, then you should be buying more then."
03/30/2021,stocks,"""Buy red sell green"" is a naive strategy. What you should do is come up with a fair valuation and sell if it gets too much in excess of your valuation, and buy more if it drops too far below it, and update your valuation as new information comes in.

If you buy a stock at $180 assuming a fair value of $200, and new information causes you to believe its only worth $100, selling at $175 isn't necessarily a poor decision.

On the contrary, If you buy a stock at $180 assuming a fair value of $200, and new information leads you to assume they're now worth $250, selling at $205 might be a mistake.

With a ""buy red sell green"" strat, you're ignoring the fundamentals and focusing solely on the number. It's a great way to be stuck holding the bag on bad companies while losing upside from your winning companies. It's also very tax inefficient because of capital gains and lack of capital losses to offset them.

If you really want to sell winners and never sell losers, just write out of the money covered calls and collect some income for it. Just keep in mind this generates lots of taxable income."
03/30/2021,stocks,"I agree that ARKK shouldn’t be a primary holding, but there’s still no reason to assume that interest rates will go up in the short term. There’s plenty of reason to believe the Fed will maintain pace for a few years, giving plenty of time for ARKK to recover. I suspect we’ll see an interest rate increase in the next Presidential term if we’re tracking over 3% come 2023."

03/30/2021,stocks,"I think it's just because the general public knows so little about investing.

Then they start doing research."

03/30/2021,stocks,Hard stuff 😮‍💨
03/30/2021,stocks,Excellent post - I agree 100%. ARKK was a rocket ship going up and all of its stocks are at insanely high valuations. Buying and holding only works here if you are honestly prepared for a 90% drop and years before it rises again. You can’t buy a stock that’s gone up 500% and dropped 30% and think it can only go up from here.

Isn't Ford the company with great ideas like borrowing 5 billion and then immediately declaring the whole amount as a dividend payment?"

03/30/2021,stocks,"If more people knew to buy long term in the money (or near the money) puts they wouldn't have to worry about these kinds of things so much... as one can drastically limit potential losses that way and give stocks a long time to recover if wanted.

People that lose 90% in a year either don't know about or don't understand the value of protective puts... kind of like relatively cheap stock insurance for most companies... especially if you sell calls to recoup the cost of the put."

03/30/2021,stocks,"Interest rates are already going up and the long end of the curve is mostly out of the Fed’s control. We shouldn’t cheer the Fed propping up the market artificially as it will just cause pain down the road in the form of lower/negative returns, at least on the indexes. If the recovery is as strong as people think then corporations shouldn’t need the Fed to continue purchasing their bonds. That will only cause excess real inflation or at the very least increased inflation expectations. Call me a bear but I don’t think ARKK will or should recover this year, it will need a long consolidation after the run it’s had."

03/30/2021,stocks,"For speculative junk like is in ARK, yes it very well well could be,

It seems 90% of ARK investors aren’t aware what is driving their growth.  It’s not tech, or adaptation, it’s nearly pure interest rates and discount factor,  Everyone loved to jump on the “future” train and see it go up, but no one realized it only did not on the strength of these future companies(their outlook and companies largely remained unchanged from their decade long path) it was simply the valuation that changed.

That’s a problem.  When most people invest in it think it’s going up for different reasons than it is.  These people who don’t understand this should get out immediately.  It’d be like investing in XOM for their oil and gas production and not understanding why it goes up or down based on what those OPEC guys say.  It’s integral to their valuation and share price, but most here don’t even know tha."

03/30/2021,stocks,"I agree with you that the 10-year likely won't go that high (you can see that in the 10y-20y spread flattening).  I think the market as a whole will do very well the next few years.  We are in a bull market.  That said, ARK has been investing in the growthiest growth stocks.  I could see tech still doing well overall, but ARK lagging because their holdings are going to be disproportionately affected. They benefitted hugely from multiple expansion as rates came down, now they will suffer from multiple contraction as rates rise.  Unless they can pivot by adjusting their holdings to the conditions, which is an interesting possibility and I'm very curious to follow what they do."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Yes, sorry. I should have been more clear. There is a perceived worry that federal interest rates may increase because the 10yr T-bill is slowly creeping up. The federal funds rate (which is used by banks to set interest rates for to lend money overnight) will not change because JPow has been reiterating that for months and even years.

The fear is that the 10yr rate will put pressure on JPow to bump the Federal funds rate.

Is that accurate? Maybe I got it wrong."
03/30/2021,stocks,I like VOO a lot. But most of the ARKK companies that took on debt last year did it to fund explosive growth and to seal in their market dominance. I think technology is changing faster than it ever has and I think it is better to have your fingers in both pies.

03/30/2021,stocks,"A long term protective put for most stocks right now is like 10% of the stock value in premium. Nobody wants to give up that kind of up side since they're in the market to make money, not preserve capital. They could just as well put their cash in a high rate savings account or bonds or diverse index, then - it's even safer and they don't have to give up 10% of the capital just go buy in.

Now, selling calls could be a way to reduce the cost of that put, but it's not like those calls don't have up side risk. So paying 10% costs up front for a protective put and then trying to make that 10% back AND get up side from the stock is, in fact, quite difficult. So again, why wouldn't people just take the safer play in bonds, high savings accounts, or a diverse index?"

03/30/2021,stocks,"I’m actually pretty bullish on stocks in general, and 70% of my retirement is in VOO (and has been for years - I never trade it, just add to it). Even though indices are at all tine highs, there is a lot of retirement money that can’t earn enough in fixed income, and I think it will go up and down a little, but mostly up for another decade. That’s for stocks in general, though.   
I’m just bearish on ARKK and other extremely overvalued tech stocks that have honestly been a huge bubble for the past year.  They are trading at such huge multiples that I think they will drop 50%+ from where they are now. I think ARKK will get to 30 or so before it bottoms out. At that point, if I like any of the stocks long-term \[I think Tesla’s a great company, for one), I’ll buy them then to hold long term.   
For me, talking about holding ARKK long-term now is like being in 2007 after buying a bunch of houses during an incredible real estate boom, and saying “I’m going to hold these long-term because they will appreciate” - well, yeah, they probably will by 2020, but wouldn’t it make more sense to sell them and then buy them in a couple of years? Or invest in something else with a better return for a while?

Obviously just my two cents, and I don’t have a crystal ball. But like any stock, I would look at the market cap compared with their likely earnings in a best-case scenario and decide for yourself if they make sense."

I wanted to just invest my money Wait a few years or more and then I need it take out. But theres no obvious way to do it.

Then I noticed theres multiple indexes on S&p 500 and I dont understand whats difference between them.

Finally I find out I cant directly invest in S&p 500 because I live in Europe. Why?

Kudos to you for taking the time to figure this stuff out. Not all of us have the privilege of being taught about the stock market from our parents. My father doesn’t understand it and my mother won’t touch the stock market ever since she pulled her money out once when the market fell and she ate the losses. I didn’t personally start exploring it until I met my boyfriend who had a decent understanding. 
I’d highly suggest referencing YouTube. There are a LOT of videos on there that will go through the difference between things like stocks, mutual funds, etfs etc- there is a video about everything on there and a lot for beginners. There are even videos explaining how to set up brokerages on specific sites. Every time you don’t know something or want to learn it deeper, YouTube can be a really good resource- at least it has been for me.
You are correct- there are a lot of different ways to track the s&p. Personally, I’m in VTI which is an ETF. If you watch this page and r/investing you can usually note the ones others are tending to invest in. Of course, always try to do your own due diligence on it too."

03/30/2021,stocks,"It's the internet. You were just venting. I was mean. I'm sorry.

I get how frustrating it can be to be excited about something new only to realize things are way harder than you thought.

Honestly, it's fantastic that you're and interested in your future this way. I'm in my 30s and wasted 10s of thousands of dollars on nonsense. If I had invested just 10% of my ""bullshit money"" I'd be an entire income bracket ahead of where I am now. Putting in small portions of your money into something like VOO as recommended is an excellent idea.

My advice would be to:

1. Get access to a brokerage account for your region. Something simple is all you need for now. You'll want to make sure it's one that gives you a good rate for buying foreign stocks.
2. Don't get too into the popular/trending stuff... Yet. Stick to market-based ETFs that give you broad coverage. Like I said, if I had spent over a decade just putting money into growth that's guaranteed over decades....
3. Read. Then read more. Seriously. Start with the basics like the basics of Economics, Finance, etc. Once you have that you'll know what you need to learn next.

The world market is fundamentally driven by sentiment and feelings. Just look at all the ""I *feel* that XYZ stock will...."" posts. Any information you have that isn't commonly understood will serve you well.

I wish you luck and wealth!"

A lot of interesting companies can be called penny-stocks because of this rule, but IMHO they stand out of the crowd.  


From my standing point I personally have followed (and still have positions) a couple of companies that have been rolling downhill for a long time, and I thought they were better than that, so I bought some shares. It fell more - I bought more. It became even worse, they switched to pink sheets, but then the magic happened - it grew immediately. Because it turns out you can't margin trade or short sell pink sheet stocks, so all the bears had to find other stock to bully, and this one started to act normally.

&#x200B;

Ever since it switched to pink sheets my position has been green. I'm still holding, since I believe this company can do better, and its not the money that I would feel bad about if they decide to go bankrupt like CHK. But if not reward could be decent, so it is worth the risk for me.

2021-03-29 21:30:06,stocks,"Read If U Want To Be Rich: Buying Archesgos' Assets (BIDU and VIAC)  

Dear people,

WSB removed my post, so here I am.

The King is back with another great DD. Check my track record on here, I'm undefeated and I plan to stay that way.

Last week, we saw an idiot go tits up in true WSB fashion, affecting the PB's they did business with. This sent many, many stocks freefalling from ATH's in TMT stocks that they held, including VIAC, BIDU, DISCA, TME, IQ, etc. while pumping S&P stocks because the short positions Archegos held had to be bought back to close out their fund. Who was the idiot that led the charge? A boy named Bill Huang, a Tiger Cub and blatant price manipulator who was levered 5-6x to 1. **Countless success can turn a man arrogant and greedy, which is what I plan to capitalize on.**

I'm here to argue the case that the PB's who liquidated Archegos' holdings, did so with disregard of the stocks' value in relation to price.

Before I begin to make my case, I ought to go over the near-term risks associated with opening positions in BIDU and VIAC or any of the stocks that Archegos held positions in, which is contagion risk. Because of the huge sell off in these names and the fact that MM's who invest in TMT tend to invest in all the same asset type, more margin calls can be triggered over the next 2-4 weeks before managers with loads of cash start loading up on these names. So my advice is to load up carefully, unlike Bill Huang, and you will be rich.

Now let's get to it then with **Catalysts and Fundamentals** for two of my favorite names Archegos was in: **BIDU AND VIAC**

Baidu (BIDU);

**Catalysts:**

**Baidu's Apollo (Level 4 autonomy) and robotaxis**

\-Started its launch in Beijing and has received its first driverless testing permit in California and its 199th driverless permit in China.

\- Plans to begin mass production of Kunlun II AI chip later this year, which will be in direct competition with NVDA's chip for autonomous domination in the car market.

**Baidu plans to start an EV car company with cars rolling out in 2024.**

**56.2% ownership stake in IQiyi, China's Netflix**

\-Currently valued at $7.7Billion

\-At IQ's recent high of $30, stake would be worth $13 Billion

**Acquisition of YY Live for a measly $3.6Billion will leverage the company's bread and butter of advertising expertise once they acquire the social media app and other assets**

**Baidu Core revenue for Q1 2021 will grow between 26% and 39% year over year.**

\-Ad revenue is Baidu's cash flow generating machine which has allowed the company to venture into other areas as mentioned above. Their core business is returning to growth and FCF will be strong.

**Fundamentals:**

21x trailing P/E or $3.4billion in net income with $1.4 billion coming from the appreciation of their long term investments, or stakes in companies like IQIYI

2020 FCF of $2.9Billion

Forecasting 10-20% full year revenue growth as China returns quicker than the US due to low covid cases and the Chinese govt's bark will be larger than their bite as they will try to prop up their economy this year.

$5.5 billion in cash with a .74 Debt to Equity Ratio, which is beautiful.

ViacomCBS (VIAC);

**Catalysts:**

**Streaming service release with an expectation of an initial boom.**

**Share price has been absolutely battered this month, falling 50% from ATH's**

**Domestic Streaming & Digital Video Revenue Growth to 72% Year-Over-Year in Q4, Driven by Strong Streaming Subscription and Streaming Advertising Revenue**

**Fundamentals:**

11x trailing P/E or $2.6 billion in net income

FCF of $1.9 billion or 15x trailing

$3 billion in cash with a 2.0 Debt to Equity Ratio, which is normal for a media company.

Compared to DIS multiples, VIAC is extremely cheap and you get a free buy-in for their streaming service.

Positions:

Baidu: 9/21 $230c, 1/22 $230c

ViacomCBS: 4/21 $50c, 1/22 $50c

The main reason I am loading up here is because this is so reminiscent of what happened because of the mass defaults that occurred in the housing crisis we saw in the US in 07-09. The difference here is that the assets that were sold off were firm-specific to Archegos' holdings. Bill Huang may have been a cheater and extremely greedy, but due to the recent sell off at fire sale prices, I believe these two stocks that his family office held have tremendous upside. And as I said with my CRSR posting a few months ago, if you inverse me here, I will crush you.

I am fairly new to investing - only 18 months or so.  Currently very little money as a medical student, but starting residency in July and will be an attending in 2024.  Right now I mostly invest in dividend stocks and my portfolio is small (~$6,000).  That said, I’m going to start getting paid soon ($64,000 annually) and will eventually be making a decent living as a doctor.  I want to find an index fund to invest in in the long term.


At present, I bank with fidelity and like some of their options (FSSNX and FZROX).  They both have low expense ratios and are cheap to get into/ maintain since I have an account with fidelity.  They also have decent diversity, with FSSNX being a bit less technology-heavy than FZROX.  I’m leaning more towards FSSNX over FZROX because it’s been around for longer, has higher diversity, and in my opinion less overall risk.


That said, I am a total noob and would love input on my thought process.  Am I going about this right?  Any suggestions from someone who isn’t an idiot like me?"

03/30/2021,stocks,"I’m biased against them because I installed a lot of enphase products when I worked in solar in the early 2010s. Their product failed constantly. They were good about honoring the warranty & word on the street is they solved the technical issues. But my personal opinion is that the concept is a gimmick that doesn’t offer any real benefit over string inverters, just marketing.

Again, no analysis of current state implied. But based on my experience, I personally wouldn’t go anywhere near it.

For solar, I think there are far better plays.

SPWR isn’t as hot of a ticker to discuss. But I know their products are the best. I’m not investing there either, because I’m staying away from alt energy entirely & haven’t looked at their financials.

I do believe in Kroger’s ability to continue to cut costs though. It’s just a question of if Amazon can sustain a prolonged competition against Kroger and Walmart."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Last 4 years mainly due to amazing tax cuts and deregulation boosting economy, international investment and consumer sentiment plus low interest rate. It’s going to be impossible to repeat that right now, had we got a split Congress then it’s might still be possible.

I do expect international stocks and real estate to have a great run though. Tax hike and wealth redistribution plans do favor real estate due to a lot more room for rent hikes. Plus slightly more people wanting to own a house. Also tax hike leads to valuation reset for US stocks and international investors rotating investments out of US. I expect global bull market to continue and many counties will see a huge bull market in the near future, unfortunately US stocks won’t be nearly as strong and won’t be the outperformed compared to international stocks for awhile."

03/30/2021,stocks,"I work in an unrelated but impacted industry. The interruption to Texas petroleum refineries led to a supply shortage of petrochemicals used in multi-industry manufacturing processes. Just one example would be the adhesives used for shipping materials and packaging. This will create a bottleneck issue for manufacturers and they are scrambling in anticipation of the coming months. I expect worst case scenario you’re going to see a lot of partially stocked shelves for a few months after the initial panic buying. Or at the very least companies will make use of other packaging alternatives and staple products will look a bit weird for a while. 

It is really difficult for me to guess how this will impact the short term market. I don’t think it will be pretty though once the news starts hyping it up as the next crisis. I’ve pulled out of retail and manufacturing stocks. Definitely not touching Amazon right now. I could see chemical companies that are diversified away from the Texas supply doing well in the coming months. Most have already been producing at capacity, but they will profit if they raise prices. I’m really not a savvy enough investor to predict this right, so I’ve just increased my cash position waiting for the right opportunity to buy low. 

Who knows, this could all turn out to be a whole lot of nothing. There are some red flags that make me think it is something big though. 
Red Flag #1: Increased insider selling around the time companies started being warned by vendors of supply shortages. Example, check out all of the recent filings within International Paper in early to mid March. 
Red Flag #2: The media has been suspiciously quiet about this. Makes me think there are coordinated efforts to keep this under the radar while the government and impacted companies scramble for solution."

not saying all etf are bad but to be careful"
03/30/2021,stocks,"With an ETF the supply is not static. When you buy or sell, you may be trading with a regular participant on the open market with existing shares. That part is true. However you may be trading with an authorized dealer.

Authorized dealers have the ability to create or destroy ETF shares. The way it works is if the ETF value starts to drift from NAV, authorized dealers step in to trade the ETF shares along with the underlying instruments.

If everyone is buying and the ETF starts to trade at a premium to the underlying, ADs will create shares by purchasing the underlying instruments and delivering them to the fund. They then sell these on the open market.

Likewise if everyone is selling. ADs will step in to buy your shares, and redeem the underlying securities from the fund, which they can then sell.

This additional arbitrage mechanism keeps NAV close to the value of the ETF. It can drift some, but rarely by much for long, especially with liquid underlying instruments which stocks ETFs tend to deal in.

This is different from say a CEF (Closed end Fund). With these the number of shares and the underlying instruments are static. Since they do not have this arbitrage mechanism, they operate totally off of supply and demand. Here you do see significant NAV drift for significant amounts of time (years even).

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange-traded\_fund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange-traded_fund)

>The ability to purchase and redeem creation units gives ETFs an [arbitrage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrage) mechanism intended to minimize the potential deviation between the market price and the [net asset value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_asset_value) of ETF shares. ETFs generally have transparent [portfolios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portfolio_(finance)), so institutional investors know exactly what portfolio assets they must assemble if they wish to purchase a creation unit, and the exchange disseminates the updated net asset value of the shares throughout the trading day, typically at 15-second intervals.[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange-traded_fund#cite_note-proposedrule-5)ETF distributors only buy or sell ETFs directly from or to **authorized participants**, which are large [broker-dealers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broker-dealer) with whom they have entered into agreements—and then, only in **creation units**, which are large blocks of tens of thousands of ETF shares, usually exchanged [in-kind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-kind) with [baskets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basket_(finance)) of the underlying [securities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_(finance)). Authorized participants may wish to invest in the ETF shares for the long term, but they usually act as [market makers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_maker) on the open market, using their ability to exchange creation units with their underlying securities to provide [market liquidity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_liquidity) of the ETF shares and help ensure that their intraday market price approximates the [net asset value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_asset_value) of the underlying assets.[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange-traded_fund#cite_note-proposedrule-5) Other investors, such as individuals using a retail broker, trade ETF shares on this [secondary market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_market).  
>  
>If there is strong investor demand for an ETF, its share price will temporarily rise above its net asset value per share, giving arbitrageurs an incentive to purchase additional creation units from the ETF and sell the component ETF shares in the open market. The additional supply of ETF shares reduces the market price per share, generally eliminating the [premium](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/premium) over net asset value. A similar process applies when there is weak demand for an ETF: its shares trade at a discount from net asset value.  
>  
>When new shares of an ETF are created due to increased demand, this is referred to as **ETF inflows**. When ETF shares are converted into the component securities, this is referred to as **ETF outflows**.[\[104\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange-traded_fund#cite_note-104)  
>  
>ETFs are dependent on the efficacy of the arbitrage mechanism in order for their share price to track net asset value.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed-end\_fund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed-end_fund)

>Closed-end funds are traded on exchanges, and in that respect they are like [exchange-traded funds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange-traded_fund) (ETFs), but there are important differences between these two kinds of security. The price of a closed-end fund is completely determined by the valuation of the market, and this price often diverges substantially from the NAV of the fund assets. In contrast, the market price of an ETF trades in a narrow range very close to its net asset value, because the structure of ETFs allows major market participants to redeem shares of an ETF for a ""basket"" of the fund's underlying assets.[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_end_fund#cite_note-6) This feature could in theory lead to potential [arbitrage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrage) profits if the market price of the ETF were to diverge substantially from its NAV. The market prices of closed-end funds are often 10% to 20% higher or lower than their NAV, while the market price of an ETF is typically within 1% of its NAV. Since the market downturn of late 2008, a number of fixed income ETFs have traded at premiums of roughly 2% to 3% above their NAV."

03/30/2021,stocks,"I really like SCHD because of its holdings weight and also its dividend is pretty nice. 

The weight of SCHD in my opinion compliments VTI (my main holding) really nicely cause VTI is under weight in consumer non cylicals and industrials. However people say SCHD is bad because it causes tax event when dividends are pay. 

Now if you had a million dollars i could see that. But at absolute max over the next 20 years i dont think id ever get over $500k. So $500k and max 10% of my holdings would be  50k for SCHD/ by current share price means id have 685 shares. 

The dividend is currently 0.5 (ish) and paid out 4 times a year. $340 x 4 times a year is $1360 thats taxable.

Unless im missing something here... are people really that worried and turned off on what i think is a very solid ETF because of $1400/ year? If you have that much in your account surely you can afford the taxes which even at 25% would only be $300ish.

03/30/2021,stocks,"The early withdrawal penalty is 10%, but since 401k’s are pretax you’d also have to pay standard income tax on the money that you take out. So you’d pay an additional 10% to do what you’re talking about versus just taking the money as income.

Most employer matches are something like 100% to 3% of pay, maybe 50% from 3-5% after that. Something along those lines. Not enough to make up for the penalty, anyway.

There are a lot of circumstances that would allow you to withdraw and dodge the early withdrawal penalty, especially with the pandemic. You can look into these. Some plans won’t let you early withdraw at all, or not when you’re employed on that plan anyway.

You’ll pay income taxes on anything you withdraw no matter what."

03/30/2021,stocks,"I’m assuming this is in relation to the market and not just about inflation in general.

For me, the real question is will that matter?  Is it better to have your money in the market and make gains, even if those will be lower gains, rather than parking your money on the sidelines just depreciating?  Institutional investors that cause these problems want to make money, so it’s only a matter of time before they come back in, so as long as your stocks are solid, you’re good.  I don’t even think the inflation fears are causing this dip as it’s better to make money as it depreciates rather than just letting it depreciate with no gains."

It should take wash sales into account, and adjust everything accordingly.

So, the amount you would be taxed on would be whatever gains your brokerage account says you've made so far YTD. 

If you bought 20k, then sold for 24k, you would only be assessed for taxes on the 4k realized profit you made (assuming no other transactions later in the year). 

It would only be 4k ""coming in"", since you would need to subtract your original cost basis."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Yeah, as long as you're not doing anything close to the 200k-2M of daily volume in transactions on the same couple of stocks repeatedly over the span of a year that this guy was doing, I wouldn't worry too much. 

Seems like he basically kept buying in/selling out of the same stocks, sometimes at a loss, sometimes at a gain. 

But, he was never able to claim any of his losing trades to cancel out his winning ones because he always bought back in the next day, or even within the same day. 

So, he just kept racking up his taxable ""gains"" over the course of the year without him realizing what was happening.

If the brokerage you're using looks like it's handling wash sale calculations automatically over your transaction history, then yes. 

If it's showing 493 YTD Gains for you, then that's the amount you would be taxed on (so far).

03/30/2021,stocks,"But doesn't that suggest that making a few good (in my example, 1) trades actually should beat the market? Peter Lynch brought up a really interesting statistic that I had not considered which is that most stocks over the course of a year that have moderate levels of volatility go up and down approximately enough to create a 50% move between the top and the bottom (so any combination of 0 to 50 & 50 to zero, i.e. -10 to +40 etc.) which means that unless you buy at a top or at least very close to a top the market should fluctuate in your favor. I agree you should trade as little as possible though."

03/30/2021,stocks,"I definitely wouldn't rely on RH's chart figures to figure out how much in taxable gains you actually have.

In fact, from OP's link to the article of the incident, it seems like the guy pretty much looked at the charts and saw '45k' gain, and assumed that was all he would be taxed on.

I use TD Ameritrade, and there's a section in my account where I can view all the gains/losses of each individual positions I've taken.

Later on, if I incur a wash sale from a future transaction, TDA will properly adjust whatever past transactions that had been affected and properly add a small note on the sides along the lines of ""wash-sale adjusted"".

On the bottom of the list of transactions, it then tallies everything up, and gives me my total YTD gains wash-sale adjusted that I would supposedly be taxed on.

RH's website by comparison looks rather sparse when it comes to this type of log-keeping. I logged into my old account and tried to find some similar feature, and haven't had any luck.

The company's support page just mentions that you can find your wash sale info on your 1099 when it's mailed out to you ... near tax time.

RH might have a sleeker, more simplified UI, but it severely lacks a lot of the important logging features that the other more established brokerages have."
03/30/2021,stocks,"> But doesn't that suggest that making a few good (in my example, 1) trades actually should beat the market?

Yes. It also suggests that doing that is much, much harder than you might think."

03/30/2021,stocks,"That's somewhat where I disagree. While I do understand, as another person posted, that retail does have the odds stacked against them from the fact that we are human, I do think that retail has the advantage of the freedom of choice that large companies and institutions do not. 

The ability to buy an undervalued company or a stably priced one that is close it's intrinsic value but is less than $30 is not something retail has any shortage of. I am not saying that retail has it easy but I am saying that all-things-considered it's much easier. Well, it was. It might not be anymore in this market."

Yeah, unfortunately it looks like RH users are pretty much kept in the dark about their ongoing wash sale activity until it's too late to make a difference. 

If you're really worried, I'd try to hit up customer support to see if they can give you up-to-date figures themselves. However, based off what I've read online, RH support has been kinda meh...

1 state perspective: Just from experience when I was in Chicago I believe cresco (supplier\grower) runs the sunnyside dispensary chain. They got super overwhelmed by rec and prices still are very high overall in the state for lower quality product and the pandemic didn't help things. Just personal feeling that a lot of cannabis stocks are going to be a longer hold for a while aside from some little spikes when news comes out especially if they do a majority of business in newly recreational us states.

You can see some progress by looking at rise dispensaries in Illinois (gti) vs their essence shops in Vegas or rise in Reno. More brands, deals, good steady flow of house brand (desert grown farms and rise brand respectively)."

This is similar to the ""get it right and no one cares, make one mistake and everyone judges you"" analogy. Shares of ETFs were indeed being borrowed previously, and in the millions at that. The volume of certain ETFs spiked up a lot as well.

So TLDR: they are wrong today, but ETFs have been borrowed in large numbers"

We don’t have to have the same opinion on how the future will go, especially when it is 100% speculation. Theres a good chance neither of us are right, theres a good chance one of us is right, im just offering a different perspective

I think that regardless of public opinion these drugs and therapies will be able to help a lot of people. Many may disagree with the science even if its concrete, but many more will become aware of it and potentially interested. All it needs is an FDA approval and we will see how it plays out"
03/30/2021,stocks,"I am specifically speaking about 18-MC and this trial which you claim could have the potential to make the company go 5 or 10x over the next 5 years.  

Is methadone profitable? Suboxone? Acamprosate? Naltrexone? These are medications which have to be taken every day and you certainly don't see any companies making big bucks off of them. Because they have to be cheap because the only people that really need them are people who rely on the government to pay for their medications due to not having money due to being severely addicted to substances. The government is not going to pay unless it is cheap. How is a medication that needs to be taken only once going to be profitable for a company? What are their propositions for who is going to pay for this medication? I'm not going to do DD on this specific company but I am deeply connected to the psychedelic science community and have been for many years and it's silly if you know how these medicines work to expect this field to be profitable. I LOVE what this field is doing for people with mental illness but cannot for the life of me understand how these companies will make money."
03/30/2021,stocks,"The science could very well be good. That part may not be speculation at all - I haven't studied it closely enough, and I fully concede there is a broad base of knowledge and development over the last 6-24 months I don't understand very well. That's not at all where I'm coming from. 

The strength of the political opposition and its indifference to even the most overwhelming science are pretty well-established fact at this point. Not speculation or agree-to-disagree. 

One side hates inconvenient science. Hard stop."
03/30/2021,stocks,"You don’t understand how the companies are going to be profitable but aren’t willing to do DD on them? Then why are we having this discussion?

Clearly you don’t understand what MC-18 is. MC-18 treats *all* addiction, not just opioids, but alcohol and every other addictive substance. I never said the government will pay for it, i just said that it shouldn’t be ruled out entirely. Considering Mind Medicine, as a single example out of dozens, is working on 4 flagship trials and about a dozen other smaller ones, only analyzing a single therapy is ignoring part of the whole picture. Additionally, they are creating drug assisted therapies, not a one and done drug. Please research these things before you speak about them as if they are fact.

And finally, i say it has the potential to 5 or 10x because right now its a currently unprofitable penny stock. All psychedelic companies are. Just by becoming profitable in any aspect they will likely 5x or even 10x. Me saying they will 5x or 10x is speculation, but its also the popular narrative in the shroom stock space. If any of these companies produce an FDA approved therapy they will not distribute it unless they make as much money as possible, its how ALL of them are set up. Even if their profits aren’t sky high, just by making money at all their market caps will likely spike from their current sub $1B cap to around 5-10

The fact is its all speculation, which is not something i have tried to hide at all considering i say it outright in my first comment. Im not going to continue to argue about something entirely speculative, there is literally no point. OP asked what peoples favourite companies are in the psychedelic space, i said my favourite was Mind Medicine and that i believe it will do well. There are *countless* DD’s that explain the ways in which most of these companies can make money, and they all do it a whole lot more cohesively than i can. If you’re seriously *that* interested, do your own research, otherwise please stop responding to me. I disagree with your rationale and thats okay, we don’t have to agree."
03/30/2021,stocks,"I think its a little too narrow to look at this from solely the united states. These drug assisted therapies will likely begin to roll out globally (at least canada for sure and likely the EU as well). I also believe that stigma will fade over time. I agree there will definitely be a lot of pushback but im of the optimistic view that it wont negatively affect the bottom line too significantly, but i could be entirely wrong

I think both sides have a fair argument and the only way we’ll have an answer is to wait and see, regardless nobody knows what the political climate will be like in ~5 years, its entirely possible things become more conservative or more liberal, its also possible we’re enslaved by aliens too

Thanks for the discussion, i really appreciate your opinion, its definitely added a new angle to think about that i hadnt yet considered in its entirety

03/30/2021,stocks,"I agree there's international potential for sure. But in order for it to ever operate in the volumes required to generate sustainable profit (the ultimate goal of investing), it would have to clear at least a few major political hurdles first.

In American markets, that means clearing American political hurdles. It's debatable whether or not cannabis has even accomplished this yet, and it has had decades of momentum and support not yet experienced in the psychedelics world.

EDIT - it's certainly a possibility that the cannabis debate will serve as a proxy for the shrooms debate and not really move the needle on the outrage-o-meter. However, there's just as much possibility that introducing psychedelics to the mainstream dialogue actually functions as an anchor weight impeding the progress of cannabis."

03/30/2021,stocks,Bro. Honestly. I don't think it's bullshit. It's all good to know. TA is so much. Previous support and resistance. Te today for example...spy hit 392.90-something and bounced and ripped. 392.90-ish was a key level of previous resistance. It acted as support today. That's TA. And if you had been paying attention to that you could have bought calls at the bottom on the way down for .13 and sold 30 minutes later for 1000% return. .13/contract to 1.60/contract. TA is a tool to have but it won't always work.

TA isn't a predictor of the value of a company or it's shares, it provides insight into what the other market particapants think about the price point. Random share is worth, at minimum, whatever price causes the supply to be exhausted. If that price point is $20, then buying increases around @20. If the ceiling is $70, selling increases around $70.

03/30/2021,stocks,"No, you're saying people are billionaires because of investing. People are billionaires because of investing because the tax systems overly incentivize long holding once you have millions to the point of ridiculous situations like buffet paying less taxes dollar per dollar than his secretary. That's a whole fucking thing and basically outside the scope of the discussion, but you can make money trading just fine, you're just penalized for doing it as an individual beyond a certain point, a point most people aren't at, which is why pretty much all billionaires are paper ones with 20+ year holdings. If you're some dude with less than a few hundred thousand it's functionally insignificant where gains made from trading can outpace capital gains losses otherwise saved from long holding.

That's not the same as saying that technical analysis doesn't work. Dismissing  technical *investing* is as idiotic as saying value trading is a thing. They're both oxymorons. They are two different tools for different situations, and you're trying to apply them to the wrong thing so of course it looks bad. You're saying wrenches are bad because you can't screw something in with it."

03/30/2021,stocks,">Tell me, why do stocks tend to reverse their trends when they hit previous highs or previous lows?

because market makers exist, so orders in a range that has very recently been covered tend to be thinner, while movements that are in a range that hasn't recently been covered tend to be slower. still, TA doesn't actually help beat the market on average, because when it's wrong, it tends to cost more than the gain from when it's right."
03/30/2021,stocks,That’s a lot of words to say nothing man
03/30/2021,stocks,">But my gripe with TA is that it is not in any way scientific, and it does not rely on statistical methods at all. In statistics, when your hypothesis is wrong, you do not simply shrug your shoulders and say oops. You go back to the drawing board and find an explanation as to why

I like to think of TA as a weather forecast. If a meteorologist says there's a 70% chance of showers, you might not want to plan a picnic for that day. But if it doesn't rain, that doesn't mean the meteorologist was wrong, it just happened to be that 30% of the time that it didn't rain.

But also, traders who use TA should try to find flaws in their analysis. If it looked like a great time to buy, but the stock price plummeted, perhaps I used the indicator incorrectly and I should take some time to refine how I utilize the signal. The  main reason I've seen that many traders lose money using TA is that they don't quite understand how certain indicators are meant to be used"

Even Burry had to hold out much, much longer than he anticipated.

All this to say what we already know - you can't really time bubbles and if you do it's all just luck. It's also clear that the Fed will always ignore bubble or only at most try to ""talk them down"" labeling actual crazy activity as ""irrational exuberance"". Their job is to always claim that everything is under control - as the monetary authority, to say otherwise would be to actually incite panic.

We shouldn't be shocked that a Family Office like Archegos went down like this because this is a complacent market enabled by the Fed Put - overconfident investors will keep leveraging up to magnify gains with extremely risky bets. I will be very shocked though if any of the big banks are actually held accountable and then forced to liquidate similar derivatives they've been selling to other fund managers.

Stupid jokes aside, they really have great revenue streams.
Disney+ has reached 100mil subscribers in 18 months. They hiked the price last week by $1. But it's still the cheapest no-ad streaming service.
It also has the second or third best content library after Netflix at the moment.
Parks are just about to open and that was 40% of their pre pandemic revenue. Cruises will also start likely in fall.
Business travel might never come back but leisure industry has so much pent up demand we are going to see a big Spike and some sustained demand for the next 2 years.
They have EPSN. They have bought Fox entertainment and sports in many non us markets including hotstar in India which streams effectively all cricket played in India.
A basic match is watch by 5mil people there on hotstar (still less than 0.5% of the population) and a world cup is coming up.
Yes, margins are lower for international markets but sheer numbers might mean revenue growth.
Next set of marvel movies are about to come out in theaters and on Disney+ (same day if you are willing to pay)
Bear case : They don't have the best balance sheet due to the pandemic losses.
Some of the tailwinds are already factored in and hence it went from 90s to 180 in a year

There have been 2 phases of this so far, 2000-2010 and 2011 to now and both have been massive disappointments for my portfolio.  The world is simply not ready or able to transition at the assumed value of these companies. This has happened over and over the last 2 decades.

Neither is a buy right now. But saying it is a strong sell, and comparing Disney to its historical PE when it is coming out of a pandemic with a flush consumer, and a streaming service that is gaining subs at twice the pace of Netflix is... I will bit my tongue.

You can't blindly follow PE, in certain situations. And right now if you are going to be doing that, you will be sitting there wondering why every reopening stock demolishes its earning projections every quarter, from q3 2021 to q4 2022. And that is why money managers are selling tech."
03/30/2021,stocks,"OK. How do I put this. When you are looking at reopening stocks, the forward PE does not matter, nor does ttm. The guidance is too cloudy to know what q3/4 will look. All that matters is cash on hand. Disneys parks turned a profit in q4 somehow. When most of the company is not making money because of a Pandemic... you throw its current multiple out. There are stocks you can adjust multiples to. This is not one of them yet."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Yup I would buy neither (and own neither), I was trying to illustrate how ridiculous the valuation is. I could go into its earnings projections over the next 2-3 years for Disney too to see when their valuation would catch up - I’m not idiot enough to blindly follow forward PE projections. You’re looking at dead money for at least three years. And I’m not impressed with fast growth of Disney+, a subscription that charges half the amount of Netflix. 

It’s still a strong sell. And most tech is getting hit hard now because of rising 10 year yields, not because of reopening. Granted reopening is contributing to the yield."
03/30/2021,stocks,What do you think “forward PE” means?
03/30/2021,stocks," So the parks weighed on margins in q4, which is not going to happen in 3 and 4 of 2021. So lets look at price to sales, when comparing Netflix and Disney then. Hell lets throw in Apple too. Disney 5.56, Apple 6.92, Netflix 9."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Or we can look at price to book, which isn't even close."
03/30/2021,stocks,OK. If you think its current forward PE is an accurate representation of the business in 2021. This is not worth my time.
03/30/2021,stocks,"shiiiiiiit. I have like 30. KO, TSLA, PEP, T, IBM, PFE, PSA, LMT, AAPL, RTX, RXT, FNILX, FZILX, etc"
03/30/2021,stocks,"No way Parks and Cruises will fully open globally by Q3/Q4 this year. Maybe Parks US in Q4 at best.

I generally care most about earnings and FCF, that’s how you value a company. I get the P/S comparison but it isn’t a great one between those companies with different margins and different industries for the most part. Would buy Netflix with a P/S of 9 any day of the week right now over Disney (again, would rather own neither). Way better margins and growth. I can get behind the earnings projections of Netflix way more than Disney. 

Why are we discussing this? We’re in agreement. There’s like 50 other people on this thread with a weak argument like “don’t bet against the mouse” and other nonsense here."
03/30/2021,stocks,"P/B, P/S, RoE are helpful indicators. You value a company by discounting the future stream of cash flows to present. Growth and earnings are great indicators of value. I’m not going to pretend I’ve done a DCF on both these companies but looking at earnings and growth projections on a graph is usually pretty helpful. 

P/B of Disney is low because they have so many fixed assets like Parks on their books. This is like comparing Microsoft and Disney in 1992 and buying Disney because their P/B was much better. This stuff is really hard to compare across industry. 

You should check out FAST graphs, I’ve found them pretty helpful for valuations."
03/30/2021,stocks,"It’s literally a projection of earnings from analysts for 2021. It isn’t what I think, it’s what professionals who do this for a living think. 

Do you think you know more about their future earnings than analysts do? Or do you think that all of the analysts forgot to think about theme parks reopening when they put their projections out?"
03/30/2021,stocks,What's your wind-down plan?
03/30/2021,stocks,"The thing is it’s a bottom estimate. So when you see the estimates. Or at least the standard without revisions, they have Disney’s sales at below 2020 q1. So if you think in q2 to 4, that they will make below q1 2020 which is when both China locations were shut down, then yes go by forward PE. Money managers are looking for EPS beats."
03/30/2021,stocks,"My strategy kind of demands that I keep a reasonable pool of shit I believe in. Its fairly diverse, so a few are usually at their 52 week high.  
I hold for a year for the tax benefit, and then sell a bit at a time as it hits 52 week highs. There are some exceptions, eg: TSLA's run up to $900.

This forces me to buy something with about a year in mind. I spent all last year putting the money in, this year I will continue to put money in, but also groom my long term lots.  
  
My rule of thumb is sell a little every time a long term play hits a 52 week high. I feel like that helps with probability of getting some of that sweet top actions. But as everyone says timing the top/bottom is impossible. 

I am trying to get 30% in IBM/T/PFE/KO and 70% in growth or mixed. Then as I get older, I will start to shift more toward dividends. I'm hoping to build it up enough to retire like 10 years early."
03/30/2021,stocks,"Analysts don’t get paid to collude to underestimate earnings. They post their forward PE estimates and the collective average estimate is the forward PE. Disney has a forward PE of 49. 

That’s too high."

03/30/2021,stocks,I’m not sure that they do.

Yes, you can draw some connection to space from nearly any company, but I can’t see how Deere will benefit so greatly from improved GPS that they belong in a Space ETF. Or Netflix from satellite transmissions, for that matter."
03/30/2021,stocks,"That's fair, I suppose.

For Deere, I'm kinda looking at it from the opposite side: they have more to give on the equipment, maintenance, GPS integration than they could benefit from.  Either way, I'm interested to see what happens."
03/30/2021,stocks,"This has been very helpful for me, because I realized I also don't know much about Deere. This is motivating me to actually learn more about these companies to see how their stock value will actually be impacted by aerospace. I'm equally interested to see what happens :)"

03/30/2021,stocks,"Ultimately, I think there will be room for all lithium producers. So it’s entirely possible that ARXRF has potential. The question is, will they be able to produce enough lithium to be profitable for investors? Will their lithium be battery grade quality (at least 99.5% pure)? And will they be able to satisfy environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria?

From glancing at their [website](https://www.infiniteore.com/latest), they seem to engage in hard rock mining and appear to still be in the early exploration stages of their lithium project. Right now their resource is inferred from historical data gathered by other drilling companies:

> The property contains known pegmatite showings, including two that contain historical resources of 2 million tons at 1.09% Li2O and 750,000 tons at 1.38% Li2O*.  

This lithium concentration is typical for hard rock mines. But at this early stage, it’s difficult to say how much lithium they’ll be able to produce on an annual basis, and how pure their product will be. In order to determine purity, they’ll first need to produce a lithium sample and send it in for testing. I think they still have a ways to go before they’re able to do that. 

You may dig around on their website and look for more info, using the questions above as a guide. 

As far as lithium mining in general goes, there are currently two major types of lithium mining: hard rock mining and brine evaporation ponds. Both of these methods can have a significant environmental impact. With hard rock mining, you dig a giant, unsightly pit in the ground with lots of heavy machinery, disrupting the local ecosystem, and if done irresponsibly, could pollute waterways. 

Traditional evaporation ponds use up massive amounts of water. They have a significant impact on the local ecology and indigenous communities in regions of South America where much of the world’s lithium is being mined. They pump the brine from underground and let it evaporate into the atmosphere, which can lower the groundwater table and speed up desertification in what is already one of the driest regions in the world. 

This is why, for me personally, I’m really interested in a new technology called Direct Lithium Extraction (DLE) that effectively eliminates these concerns. It utilizes ion-exchange or adsorption beads to extract the lithium directly from the brine. This results in extremely high lithium purities, and is done in just *a few hours* versus the evaporation pond process which can take up to two years. Once the lithium has been extracted, the brine can be returned right back into the ground where it came from. This process has a minimal environmental impact and a very small surficial footprint (no unsightly open pit mine or huge evaporation ponds). 

There are several junior lithium producers currently testing this technology for mass production in South America, Canada, Europe, and the United States. I believe it's going to be positively disruptive for the lithium industry and the environment. But keep in mind, it has yet to be proven for mass production. 

Lake Resources (LLKKF) is one of these companies. They own a massive lithium resource in Argentina within the Lithium Triangle, and they’ve been able to prove that their lithium is 99.97% pure (battery grade quality). Another company wanting to utilize DLE technology is E3 Metals (ETMC/EEMMF). Their brine resource is located in Alberta, Canada. Both of these stocks have their own subreddits if you’d like to learn more about them. 

All this being said, don’t be discouraged to invest in ARXRF. Currently the largest lithium producers in the world do hard rock mining and evaporation ponds. Just make sure you do your due diligence on the company."
