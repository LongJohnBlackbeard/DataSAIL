2021-05-13 19:42:33,stocks,"you bought weeklies/short dated options

never buy those

congrats, everyone learns this lesson some way or another"
2021-05-13 19:44:11,stocks,"For starters you bought way too short expiries on those options.

$CLF and $FCX are coming down off good runs, and may take a few days off before getting a beat."
2021-05-13 19:45:33,stocks,"Weeklies are best for day trades, imo. Theta and iv will kill those far more often than not."
2021-05-13 19:44:03,stocks,Wow that was bloody quick! Thanks for the response. So... why are they bad?
2021-05-13 19:49:42,stocks,"Yeah, I'm seeing how I made a mistake here. I invested only what I was willing to lose, and therefore bought the cheaper calls so I could buy more... I'm reading into weeklies."
2021-05-13 19:53:17,stocks,"I see. Thanks my dude. I just learnt about weeklies, and have no clue how theta and iv play into this. I'm going to look into that... but I also wouldn't mind an ELI5 lol"
2021-05-13 19:46:13,stocks,Cause they can expire before the trendlines move the mark price in your favor
2021-05-13 19:47:30,stocks,"Also, thank you for buying my CLF calls it really helped blunt the red this week."
2021-05-13 19:52:02,stocks,"the market is very volatile which is good but volatility cuts both ways. short dated options can move up quickly and can move down quickly. with longer dated options (like 90 DTE+), you can still feel it but on red days, it's not as brutal. if you're buying a weekly, you're basially gambling

oh and since i know you're going to make this mistake because everyone in the world has, don't buy a far otm call just because it's cheap. look into debit spreads."
2021-05-13 19:47:59,stocks,"SMH. I'm reading on this right now. TIL... So would it better to just take the loss, close my positions and start over?"
2021-05-13 19:50:59,stocks,"lmao! Yeah man, just don't get used it. There's only so much I can bail you out lol"
2021-05-13 19:58:03,stocks,"Haha, thanks! I'll def keep that in mind. As for spreads, TD won't let me do them yet... So now I'm looking into opening an account with interactive brokers."
2021-05-13 19:51:26,stocks,"Maybe. It may fall a bit more before it finds support. We kinda just bounced of resistance.

I'm sticking with shares. There is some mild cautionary sentiment about steel being bubbly right now. A big correction would absolutely wipe out call holders if they aren't hedged."
2021-05-13 19:44:35,stocks,"Damn, trying to make a quick buck on the DAPL is pretty savage"
2021-05-13 19:51:26,stocks,ET is much more than just the DAPL. DAPL and Q1 earnings are just the recent catalyst
2021-05-13 19:32:30,stocks,"Any time you make a realized gain you will pay taxes on it when you file. Your dividends will require you to pay taxes also when you file. 

This is if you are not using a tax advantage account and in the US"
2021-05-13 19:34:03,stocks,You‚Äôll receive a tax form from your broker that will help you understand what to submit when filing. Your tax burden is a function of realized gains and losses so open positions are not factored in to what you owe.
2021-05-13 19:39:23,stocks,I do what ever Turbo Tax tells me ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
2021-05-13 19:25:07,stocks,"No, if you don't do transactions selling something in positive.

Yes, always."
2021-05-13 19:43:54,stocks,"That might be too late. 

In most cases you might have to be paying estimated taxes quarterly throughout the year, both Federal and State. Otherwise you will be facing some penalties on tax day."
2021-05-13 19:12:07,stocks,I've held through worse... emotion will ruin you. If you want to be successful as a long time investor. Then just hold the line and continue to DCA like any other day... no one can predict when the bottom or the top will be... chances are if you pull your money out you'll miss the gains when it bounces back quick..
2021-05-13 18:45:32,stocks,"History shows that just holding through works better, so that's what I'll do."
2021-05-13 18:45:48,stocks,"Yeah, same. I just believe in companies I invested in."
2021-05-13 19:02:25,stocks,I'm buying more. I'm young enough to survive.
2021-05-13 19:34:33,stocks,If you are freaked out by a downturn like this you should just be in a mutual fund not stock picking.
2021-05-13 18:47:40,stocks,">I see a lot of people saying ""I moved everything to ETFs"" or ""I sold all my stocks and have pillows for my couch now with all the cash"".

Majority of these post are by new people who first put money into the market, aside from their 401k, during March 2020 crash. And since then have only seen a straight line up.

They literally think the market only has one color. Green. And now getting a wake up call that it uses a second color"
2021-05-13 19:58:13,stocks,"If you are young and your time horizon is decades, it makes zero sense to sell now unless you absolutely need the cash.  History has proven that the stock market goes up 100% of the time in the grand scheme of things.  Very few (if any) people can correctly time the market.  Most of those people probably got lucky too.

Just hold."
2021-05-13 18:56:53,stocks,This is a minor pullback... I don‚Äôt understand all the angst. These happen several times EVERY single year.
2021-05-13 19:04:40,stocks,"Yep. That‚Äôs the plan. I‚Äôm at an L with some of my stocks. What‚Äôs the point of selling at loss and rushing to another one. I‚Äôm happy with the companies prospects but of course not happy at how much they‚Äôve gone down. 

Just easier to hold than do anything else."
2021-05-13 18:54:44,stocks,I'm just not logging in to my etrade account for a couple months....
2021-05-13 19:59:58,stocks,"I've had 90% of my investments in Etfs anyway, the rest in VEEV. That's down like 3%. So, I'll ride it."
2021-05-13 19:00:17,stocks,"Started investing in mid November, mostly into tech because of the hype and recently great performance. In the past three months I watched all my stocks lose all the gains I made in my first 2 months. Kind of hard to watch.

Seriously thought about just selling at a loss and dumping everything into a world index, but I decided to stick to my initial plan and just sit this one out. 
I am not reliant on this money today so I have the freedom to just wait, someday it will go up again, and in the meantime I have the possibility to acquire more shares at a lower price with my monthly deposits.

So yeah, I agree with you, just wait."

2021-05-13 19:46:20,stocks,Held through 2008 and 2020. I can‚Äôt compete against algos to trade.
2021-05-13 19:02:17,stocks,"You‚Äôre crazy.  Stocks will never recover.  This is different than 1999, 2004, 2009, 2012, 2018, 2020, and every other pull back in history.  This time stocks will never recover"
2021-05-13 19:00:30,stocks,I sold all of my long positions and have been shorting the market. I'm doing great. Red days are green days for me now.
2021-05-13 19:49:21,stocks,What storm?
2021-05-13 19:22:51,stocks,Holding is the only way I can squeeze out premiums from my shitty stock. I gonna be selling options for a long time.
2021-05-13 18:56:49,stocks,"I reallocated last year after the crash, at the time I was solely in ETFs and was down about 40%. I rode crypto and spacs to a 250% increase over the next 10-11 months. Was doing really well until the rotation into cyclical stocks happened.  Sold off most of my more speculative holdings and back to a decent place so I'll ride this out picking up discounted stocks along the way."
2021-05-13 19:37:54,stocks,"Same. My portfolio looks like: 30% AMD(slowly averaging down), ARKX, averaging down/slowly catching a knife on LYFT, smaller positions in AAPL and BABA. Plus one sketchy biotech that is too small for me to talk about here. 

I‚Äôve sold out of most of my more shady speculative stuff at losses and still down another 20% on what I have here but fuck it."
2021-05-13 19:07:20,stocks,Buy gee em ee
2021-05-13 19:44:40,stocks,Sell and wait. ETF gonna burn. But ehh do what you want you are an adult
2021-05-13 19:30:24,stocks,I held through last March when my portfolio dropped to 30%. This shit's amateaurish.
2021-05-13 19:36:23,stocks,Me too
2021-05-13 19:07:51,stocks,Good mentality too have. As long as your investing in solid companies you got nothing to fear.
2021-05-13 18:53:36,stocks,"Market also has another colour, red. Red gets me fucking hard. Yanked all my shit mid April. Sitting on cash waiting for the real market crash. Then go back in at early Covid prices. Why would you ride the market down?"
2021-05-13 19:49:18,stocks,Basically once a month usually besides for 2020 that was just plain easy mode
2021-05-13 19:38:09,stocks,"Do what I do - open a position in VTI or VOO and slowly DCA to ensure it makes a sizeable portion of your portfolio. In choppy markets like the one we're in with consistent weekly declines, it'd be great to build that index fund armor around your portfolio. 

Hold on the rest. There is no reason to sell at a loss if the reason you bought these tech companies haven't changed. If you don't need the money (which you shouldn't because you parked it aside for long term investing), don't sell."
2021-05-13 19:53:34,stocks,There is one stock that will
2021-05-13 19:30:00,stocks,Post positions or ban
2021-05-13 19:04:48,stocks,"Yeah, cause all the companies are gonna spontaneously go bankrupt.

Edit: Jesus /s"
2021-05-13 19:16:47,stocks,So many people on Reddit were talking about the ‚Äúreal‚Äù crash back in April and may when I was buying last year and they missed the biggest run in history.
2021-05-13 18:57:25,stocks,Haha good luck with that
2021-05-13 19:04:09,stocks,Time in the market beats timing the market.
2021-05-13 19:36:59,stocks,"HURR BEAR R MAEK MAD

You do you, my guy. I'm not yet convinced this is a correction worth pulling money out of but VIX is high, so there's that? Of course, there's also DCA or ""buy the dip""."
2021-05-13 19:34:26,stocks,Do you‚Ä¶ not understand sarcasm?
2021-05-13 19:39:29,stocks,I think they meant to put /s
2021-05-13 19:29:28,stocks,Lol.
2021-05-13 19:14:28,stocks,This times a million... the people who constantly pulls money in and out of the market will forever be behind those that just let it ride.... this seems like a big dip but pull way back out on that chart you're looking at and tell me what you see! Money is made during bulls but fortunes are made during bears..
2021-05-13 19:44:30,stocks,"this applies to someone who is buying whole market index funds, not balls deep in individual stocks"
2021-05-13 19:18:53,stocks,I bought in high. I've just been averaging down the whole time.

2021-05-13 18:13:56,stocks,I doubt it. They will get bought out!  Your stock will quad.
2021-05-13 18:27:10,stocks,US companies continue to post stellar earnings while Canadian companies shit the bed. $MSOS is the way and currently at a nice discount.
2021-05-13 19:30:39,stocks,"So a few months ago a lot of people were pumping ACB and I did everythi g I could to try and convince people to stay away. 

You should cut your losses. This company is garbage. A lot people will say ""Canadian is poo, go MSO"" but ACB is not a regular MJ company. They have done everything they could since day one to screw over the investors and pocket their winnings.

They have done more dilution than any other major MJ company in Canada. If you hold they will most likely dilute more and your shares will sink."
2021-05-13 17:40:48,stocks,WEED or nothing
2021-05-13 17:54:54,stocks,"I don‚Äôt have much future hope for the Canadian companies if we get federal legalization here soon. They will need us partnerships to thrive and just look at all the us mso ready for nasdaq listing. Or look at clvr and their cost of production. So yeah, consider a different cannabis play."
2021-05-13 18:09:31,stocks,Remember ... its only a loss if you sell!
2021-05-13 19:20:27,stocks,I got outa them long ago. Had been in long enough I actually made a few bucks but writing was on the wall. Jump shit and save what you can.

2021-05-13 18:12:28,stocks,I‚Äôm wondering if this damn stock is going to 0
2021-05-13 17:45:22,stocks,"I love twilio and Jeff Lawson. I still think twilio has massive potential in the future and we are more then ever entering a communication centric environment. There biggest moat is their high switching costs and it has been proven in the past that it isn't worth for companies to switch to a different communication platform or even try to build their own internal communication platform.

Twilios API is awesome in general, you can create so many cool apps with it.

Not really related to the company to much but they have one of the best hackathons for programmers."
2021-05-13 17:43:46,stocks,It's a good long term hold. No one knows how tech is going to move over the next few months.
2021-05-13 18:18:37,stocks,"
>>I still think they‚Äôre PE is decent for a growth stock

PE? What PE? Where's the 'E' in PE? Do you know what the 'E' stands for?  $207 million net loss last quarter vs $95 million net loss same quarter last year. So net losses have more than doubled.  Priced to perfection even after the massive drop to 20x forward sales. Would you buy an iPhone worth $1000 for 20x that price because it's a great phone

So what do you mean by ""PE is decent""????"
2021-05-13 17:13:58,stocks,"I'm bearish on Cathie Wood holdings for the time being (and this isn't an idea that I just grabbed in case somebody accuses me of that).

You may think that they can't go any lower but yes they can. 

It's not that I think she sucks or anything, but this has been a completely brutal market environment for growth stocks."
2021-05-13 17:25:19,stocks,Buy BAND instead
2021-05-13 18:03:14,stocks,"When stocks are negative, everything dips. When stocks are positive, this one seems to go 50/50 up or down. Just seems kind of manipulated tbh. Especially over the last 2 weeks. 9 days of red, 1 day up like 1 dollar, then 2-3 days of red, then up 5 percent, then down 5 percent, then down 3 percent, then up 4 percent, then down 5%. That's not the same pattern for all tech, so it's definitely targeted. Just think it's a huge over reaction. Might as well just have done this at the beginning of the year, versus now."
2021-05-13 17:24:03,stocks,"It‚Äôs only brutal because the last few weeks hedge funds decided to dump tech. Inflation scares yes, but tbh the very strategy that many people say to do ‚Äúhold‚Äù doesn‚Äôt even apply to them. If they can manipulate the market for profit they will. Let‚Äôs be honest, if everyone just kept their money in the market and shrugged off the noise on inflation, would they really lose money or just not be as profitable? I know if they can make an extra percent, they won‚Äôt hesitate to ruin one industry to do so."
2021-05-13 16:48:55,stocks,">One of the easiest benchmarks to look for in a stock is to see if a stock has beat VTI/SPY on a 1 year and 5 year chart or not. If the stock hasn't done that, why would you pick an individual stock and introduce more risk to yourself?

Past performance isn't a guarantee of future results. Companies on a 5 year hot streak might go sideways or down for a while (see: Apple since its split). Companies that have been underperforming might have a good year because of unexpected sales, a new product, etc. It's about identifying opportunities as well as trends.

As far as something like KO, people may be attracted to things like lower volatility or higher dividends."
2021-05-13 16:36:33,stocks,"and if you bought 100% aapl you would have beat spy by 4x

if you bought 100% jnj you would have underperformed spy by 50%

if you bought 100% GE, you would be down 50%


hindsight will always be 2020, more risk = more reward"
2021-05-13 17:34:16,stocks,"Beating the market, contrary to a popular misconception that floats around here frequently, is not hard to do. Using KO is a bit of a loaded example; they're a very mature company, who's extreme growth has largely passed, and now churns out consistent, but modest returns. No one who is actively trying to beat the market is invested in them."
2021-05-13 17:41:41,stocks,The reason is always the same...‚ÄùI can be in the 0.5% that pull it off...‚Äù. A large number of people who invest are not investing‚Äîthey are gambling for a big gain. Slow and steady with nearly guaranteed good growth is not interesting to them.
2021-05-13 18:44:23,stocks,It‚Äôs more interesting to pick individual stocks and if you are more interested in investing you are more likely to keep funding your account over a long period of time. That‚Äôs the reason to do it.

2021-05-13 16:34:37,stocks,"In other words, tech continues to get destroyed until I decide to sell. Inflation may not look That good, but not a reason for a 30% sell off in the last 2 weeks. I don‚Äôt even know if any news can propel it back that 30 percent lost on the next two months"

2021-05-13 16:37:41,stocks,Sounds about right
2021-05-13 16:38:42,stocks,Disagree. They‚Äôre trading at 91 forward PE. Have to crush the revenue and subscriber estimates to maintain that.

I'm seeing this as a buying opportunity."

So looks like more downside than upside in an upcoming choppy market. Price you bought it at doesnt matter - what matters is if you think there is more upside or downside from the current value.

2021-05-13 18:43:11,stocks,"I don't think any of this is remotely true, and I'm long on SoFi, SQ, and PYPL (and I also like Stripe a lot). You act like the fintech space is a small market waiting for one or two entities to dominate. The available market is way too big for that to happen. 

Stripe is better served for developers and higher volume e-commerce, which of course will continue to grow. But that doesn't infringe on SQ's dominance in the everyday small-business space where millions of companies simply want (1) an easy in-store POS, and (2) an easy website to accompany (1). That doesn't even take into account SQ's future in lending, which will be a huge asset to this existing base, as well as the market out there of small businesses that can't get financing from traditional banks.

And SoFi has done nothing comparable to SQ (or PYPL) when it comes to the consumer fintech side. SoFi has under two million members, which SQ easily dwarfs with the Cash App (and PYPL easily dwarfs with Venmo). Sure, SoFi has plenty of exciting products that can compete, but I just don't see how they can dominate in every single space they exist, especially when companies like SQ have a *huge* headstart.

I view it like this: SoFi dominates the consumer fintech side *for large consumer purchases like student loans* while SQ and PYPL dominate the consumer fintech side *for smaller, everyday purchases.* At the same time, both SQ and PYPL have the ability to merge the consumer side *with the merchant side that they also serve* while SoFi doesn't even operate on the merchant side AFAIK to any significant degree."

I've used them at my business since 2017 and KNOW they're going to be huge moving forward. Have made over six-figures playing with them since then when it was still trading around $40. They don't really have a competitor since no one else has similar hardware or software. Chase's Clover isn't nearly as popular but I've seen it around. 

Only reason Dorsey picked up so much coin is because he believes it will be a payment method in the next decade and as a payment processor that will be a huge boon to their entire business."

2021-05-13 15:41:31,stocks,You can also make profits if you go by fundamentals and the stock drop is merely a knee jerk reaction to the news cycle. That is what i am trying to assess.

2021-05-13 16:36:31,stocks,They've a big holding In Bitcoin tho as far as I know. When it's counted as cash equivalent it has lost like 33% of it's value since last earnings.
2021-05-13 17:35:54,stocks,It‚Äôs not that their coin holding is the main business it‚Äôs that they recognized a lot of revenue through cash all trading but it wasn‚Äôt a lot of profitability from it. I don‚Äôt mind it on the balance sheet.
2021-05-13 16:33:48,stocks,Whoever was talking about crypto didn't actually read the shareholder letter and listen to earnings call. Bitcoin revenue only contributed to <9% of their gross profit and even with Bitcoin tanking it won't have big impact on profitability of SQ in the long run.
2021-05-13 18:40:45,stocks,"It's not even close to their main cash cow. It was a big part of their revenue, but pretty negligible in their net profit

2021-05-13 17:07:06,stocks,"Yeah they were up money. My comment is that they declared it last earnings probably when btc was at 60k or 70k. Today it was 40k?   It's a drop since.    
I don't know the value.    
I don't know how much they're making off transactions too. Reading some stuff they don't profit off transactions yet. So I have no idea."

My question to you though is did you have a target price in mind when you bought it? If so, what factors led into identifying your target price? If your reasoning is sound, then you can stick by your investment or dollar cost average into it. However, if you haven‚Äôt had an identifiable plan, then you‚Äôre going to be happy-go-lucky when it goes up and have anxiety or feel clueless when it drops. 

I‚Äôm not following their news, but what I can tell you is this is likely an all-or-nothing investment because they don‚Äôt have a single drug that‚Äôs been approved or actively selling yet. I‚Äôm not knocking the business, but it‚Äôs too new of a company to accurately forecast. I just think there‚Äôs too much downside for me to enter a new position atm."

Yeah they are struggling right now business-wise because we still haven't developed the abilities for humans/animals but gene editing for plants and drought resistance will be the likely next step. Once these companies take a couple more steps in the right direction, the business/investment side will pick up. If you aren't interested in ""choosing a single horse"", you could always invest in some ETFs that follow these biotech companies. I think ARKG has a decent collection?

If you're thinking of just trying to make some $$$ this year, I wouldn't do it. If you're looking for a long position (""lotto ticket"") to hold for the next 5 years, then I'd definitely think of investing. Just my opinion though - not a smart business guy.

Total 200 shares with an average of $110 (this is what you will see in summary positions page). 

Sell 100 shares (by default it will use FIFO-first in first out) therefore selling the first batch which was bought for 100$. Now your summary of positions will show:

But there might be some exception of if you sell the whole position within 30 days? Not 100% sure."
2021-05-13 16:20:32,stocks,"Not if you sell ALL of the stock.

Example.  Buy 20 of X jan 1.  Buy 20 of x feb 1, sell 22 of x march 1st.  Wash rule triggered -- you are keeping 18 shares you bought BEFORE the sale.

Now say on mark 1st you sell ALL 40 shares.  wash rule not triggers as there are no shares to attribute wash sell rule to -- UNLESS you buy again within 30 days.  wait 32 days to buy same or similar and you are good.

At least that is my understanding of it."
2021-05-13 15:15:02,stocks,"Assuming his order was processed as FIFO, the OP selling of shares would have come from the oldest tax lot (which was purchased greater than 30 days before selling). Could you please give an example using FIFO selling procedure that would recreate the OP position of triggering the wash sale when applied to downsizing the position from selling 40 of the originally purchased 50 shares in January. I guess I‚Äôm just not following how it has been triggered in this situation since the shares would have come from the older lot"
2021-05-13 14:55:37,stocks,"You sold within 30 days of your purchase. It‚Äôs a standard wash sale violation.

I linked the source - that clearly states ‚Äú30 days BEFORE or after this sale, buys a ""substantially identical"" stock or security, or acquires a contract or option to do so.‚Äù

There were 26 days between 2/10/21 and 3/8/21. 26<30. That‚Äôs a wash sale."

2021-05-13 14:57:39,stocks,"Yep I agree the plain language you posted is very straight forward. I think part of what‚Äôs tripping me up is one rep said it was not a violation, and another said he‚Äôd never seen it triggered in this situation before. And I‚Äôd expect they‚Äôd have to deal with dumbasses like me all the time. Anyways, thanks again for clearing things up!

2021-05-13 13:57:17,stocks,yes it‚Äôs a good approach!
2021-05-13 14:36:54,stocks,"The approach you‚Äôre explaining essentially limits your up and downside risk. 

As a mathematical explanation, if the average return is 7% on the VTI, and your individual investments net you 10%, with a 70% and 30% weighting for VTI and individual stocks (in just going to say you invested in 1 to make it simple), your average return would be 7.9% ([7%*70%]+[10%*30%]). 

There‚Äôs nothing wrong with the approach it basically just gives you less volatility relative to the market. If you beat the market you‚Äôll beat it by a smaller margin than if you were to solely invested in your individual companies (which should be the case anyways). If you underperform, you‚Äôll only under perform by a small margin, hence limiting your up and downside risk relatively speaking."

2021-05-13 15:05:56,stocks,Me too man. Seems like most people who had fun last year have been living a nightmare the past few months. I bought a huge lot of BIG names in tech thinking it was safe since they were well known companies and not necessarily ‚Äòmemes‚Äô. Never thought they would tank 40%+. Expensive lesson but surely this realization and learning experience will net you gains and comfort in the future.

2021-05-13 18:34:35,stocks,"Meh, hard to go wrong with an index fund. 

But you need to understand, ""volatility"" and 99% of the stuff you see on reddit is useless noise.

If you're going to invest in a company, invest for the right reasons. Volatility doesn't mean anything, the market is not rational. Invest in solid companies with good books and good management. Expect to leave your money in for at least 3-5 years.

If you haven't read Peter Lynch's books (All of them) do so immediately. Forget about the stupid bullshit espoused on reddit all the time - half is pump n dump, half is memes, and it is all bullshit. Most people here do not know what the fuck they're doing, and those that do (and post about it) often have ulterior motives. Even those that are well meaning and know what they're doing are often caught up in hype and memes. 

Learn to read a balance sheet and call the investor relations people of any company you're thinking of investing in. If it's a good one you will make money. Put your money in and leave it unless the balance sheet or management starts to signal that you should get out. Otherwise, an index fund will earn you a solid 7-10% a year on average, or more if you cash out on the highs and buy during lows.

Slow and steady wins the race..think long term..if you need some thrills put aside a few thousand dollars a year for your ""high risk"" investing and don't cry if it gets wiped out, cash out if it will make you a fortune. If this kind of thrillseeking / gambling suits your style you'd be better off trading highly leveraged FX - you'll make more (or lose it all) much faster."

2021-05-13 18:30:05,stocks,I think more people should honestly check their portfolio's performance vs. the index funds and see after a year if they really beat it.

I'm going to round my first year of seriously managing my portfolio soon and I have a feeling I'm going to wish I just went with VTI and spent those hundreds of hours doing something else.

2021-05-13 17:32:33,stocks,"Not to be a negative Nancy, but you could be in for a very depressing and demoralizing ride with index funds too. Look at what happened to the S&P 500 in 2008, and look how many years it took just to get back to where it was. ~~10~~ 5 years is a long time to wait just to break even. Index funds still always win in the VERY long term (like, decades of time, not months or years) but you need to understand that you are not at all immune from prolonged periods of extreme losses.

Edit: As pointed out below, it took about 5 years to recover from the 2008 financial crisis. However, even at its peak right before the 2008 crash, it had just barely broken even after it's decline from the same price back in 2000. So anyone that bought in before that first crash got to enjoy 13 years of pain and suffering."

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, it can, it‚Äôd be unprecedented and reflective of wider scale serious problems with the American economy (that likely would impact the single stock players big time too) but outside of that you can set and forget. Market can dip 15% in a month and it‚Äôs literally no sweat assuming you don‚Äôt have liquidity problems.



That said there takes a great deal of maturity to not get fomo from big runs on single stocks like Facebook, Google, Tesla or alternate investments like crypto. I think stock picking is fun so use only a portion (less than 10%) of my investments in single stock picks. Worth it to feel like a genius when you pick correctly :)"

2021-05-13 19:08:10,stocks,Another one bites the dust!
2021-05-13 19:11:20,stocks,"Did exactly the same thing myself.

Lost thousands on mavis despite being in profit. I had 20k in profit which dropped down to 5k in profit when I finally got out of the game stop. I learnt that being greedy was my enemy, rather than the volatility. 

I'm still carrying huge positions in some meme stocks, but i'll bail as soon as they break even or end in profit.

I matched the thousands i have in my meme stocks with ETF's. 

I did this on friday and the market pooped on monday >_<

That being said, i'm far more bullish about the long term prosepcts of the S&P500 and the high dividend low volatility etf's compared to some of the cult meme stocks that are ongoing right now, with subreddits run by 15 year old kids who run the place like its fucking myspace.

even if the whole market goes through another 2008 style crash, it will recover. Look at the lowest point of 2008 and look at where we are now. It's a staggering increase. In fact, since the worst part in 2008, to where we are now, we have increased by 459% on the S&P500. 

Can you imagine investing ¬£10,000 at the 'dip' of one of the worst market meltdowns ever? You'd have ¬£56,000 in your hand now for doing nothing. Find me a bank that can give you those returns over a 13 year period. 

Finally, I dont trust the market. The shorting, the hedgies, the overall fuckery of so many stocks. I look at pennystocks regularly and the manipulation here is so blatant with zero enforcement. The only way to win as a retail investor is to go very long on the whole market, through ETF's. This is the only thing that cant be easily manipulated.

edit - I forgot to add, the 13 year rise is where the market spend a huge portion of those 13 years digging itself out of the 2008 hole. It's really only in the last 2-3 years it kicked off.

Just imagine if the S&P500 hits 10,000 points in the next 5 years."

Not even, less risk, **more** reward. The vast, vast majority of traders do not beat the index over the long term. Welcome to the boring club! Investing is counter-intuitive to many, because spending more time ""learning"" it does not necessarily correlate to higher returns.  


I'd rather focus my energy on starting a business or improving my career to make more money, things that I have direct control over."
2021-05-13 19:41:57,stocks,"This is why I have my portfolio split into different strategies. Most in index funds, some active funds - and then a smaller bucket of individual stock picks.

I get to pretend I know what I'm doing with my individual picks, but I've limited how much of my portfolio I'm able to risk. Enough that if I pick a 10x win it will be significant - but if a pick goes to $0 it won't wipe out my accounts."

2021-05-13 19:48:54,stocks,Sometimes we allow emotion to factor into investment decisions. Humans are inherently loss-averse.  The pain of the loss can become unbearable due to the evolutionary hard-wiring of our brains.  It is survival instinct kicking in.  High Growth equals High Volatility.  There is a greater likelihood many of these high growth stocks will return to the peaks and go higher than stay flat or drop indefinitely.
2021-05-13 16:45:10,stocks,I‚Äôve been in index funds for over 30 years and have made a LOT of money. Just look at the S&P since the 1980‚Äôs. That‚Äôs hard to beat while still keeping your sanity.

Never buy a stock you don't believe in.  Never buy a stock with the hopes of getting rich tomorrow.  If you don't plan on holding it for 5 years, don't even think about buying it.  And most importantly, don't buy at an all time high - or even close to it.

2021-05-13 19:55:37,stocks,"It's so hard to beat the market because the market is rigged against you. 

You have better odds of beating poker because poker is impartial. 

The stock market is run by private banks that made their money centuries ago enslaving the world. You can't win without extreme luck and human intervention going your way. 

People keep saying ""they're professionals they'll always win!"" 

Thing is though, ""professional"" anything doesn't always win. 

The house always wins in a casino because they control the games and every game is designed to give them an edge over you and long term you can't beat those odds. 

The ""professionals"" always win in the market because they make the market. They are the game...they are the dealer....they are a player and they bought the house(govt)

Index funds are your best chance of making returns because it's all rigged. Betting on individual stocks has such a low chance of success because you're betting against Citadel the HF but Citadel the MM controls 40% of retail trades and makes the market work against you in their favor. 

Like a casino if you win too much they will boot you out.

Like the market when we won too much they turned off buying on you ..this booting you from the game"

An exchange traded fund (ETF) is a type of security that tracks an index, sector, commodity, or other asset, but which can be purchased or sold on a stock exchange the same as a regular stock. 

I was invested in several sector ETFs that track a specific set of stocks - when I say I moved to the index I meant a total stock market index, like VTSAX which has an ETF that tracks the index called VTI. 

In short I moved from cherry picking sectors using Etfs and individual stocks to just buying the total stock market every week."

* TAN was another high flyer I owned, had some tremendous gains. Those evaporated, but in order to make up for it WOOD made a huge runup. Sold off some of my WOOD to add to TAN.

* Also carrying a much greater cash balance than I have for a while, owing to the fact that I'm squeamish on having any meaningful Treasury exposure at this time. They sure were great to own a year ago, but nowadays every indicator is pointing towards higher yields, whether that's still a ways off or whether the Fed rethinks its policy sooner is anyone's guess though!

edit: i'm down likle 5k in the last few weeks on overall stock prices but up about 1k by selling theta over that given period.. I'm confident those stocks will all bounce back so it doesnt really matter to me as long as i'm selling above my entry point.

2021-05-13 19:05:09,stocks,">Usually it ends up looking like very safe and consistent decent returns. But then one day the contract goes against you and you end up with a massive loss. Kind of like picking up pennies infront of a steamroller

I've come to this conclusion as well especially regarding spreads. They kinda suck. The ""optimal"" setup is to get 1/3rd width of strikes and close @ 50% profit. So for a $5 wide spread you're trying to get $1.50 credit and close at $0.75 profit. So basically getting $75 by risking $350 and that's considered ideal. But if just one spread goes against you and you get that $350 loss, it wipes out almost 5 winning trades.

Theta gang decay probably works better in a more steady market but for 2021, at least for me, it's been total ass. It's just delta gang where when you lose you have nothing to show for it (assuming spreads instead of puts).

If we're required to be such good stock pickers to come out ahead (i.e. 5 winning trades to offset 1 loss), and someone has that ability, going long on low IVR calls and puts seems like the move. With so much movement this feels like a buyers market rather than a sellers"
2021-05-13 18:26:18,stocks,"I've yet to have a massive loss from theta strategies. There isn't really a downside compared to just holding shares. Where I've been burned is on covered calls. They are a solid strategy the vast majority of the time. However, all it takes is one rocket to realize you could have made a lot more money.

So, I don't really see it as a loss as much as a reduced gain."

Again, she is beating the Indexes right now, even after the correction. Maybe she is wrong and the next 5 years she will underperfom, but her current stock history is only showing that her picks were exceptionally good in the last few years."

AQN also pays a hefty dividend (4% yield) and yet still remains highly profitable. Their DRIP is also one of the best on the market, with a 5% discount if you're enrolled.

2021-05-13 13:42:17,stocks,"PE would still be 8.

They're saying that since you, the shareholder, are 'entitled' to the $3 of earnings per share, it would take 8 years for that to add up to $24 ($3 per year √ó 8 year)"

2021-05-13 14:46:26,stocks,"Thank you. So if shareholder never sees the entitled earning (doesn't do buybacks or offer div.) the price would stay the same for 8 years?

So you wouldnt see the value in the PER but rather shareholder equity?"
2021-05-13 15:10:55,stocks,"Yeah kinda. 

It depends on what management does with those earnings. If they don't do dividends or buybacks or reinvest it to fund growth, and instead opt to just house it on the balance sheet, that's still earnings that we're entitled to as a shareholder. After 8 years, they'd have $24 per share in cash on their balance sheet. There's no reason to think that company's stock price would remain $24 (since anyone could just buy the company outright, cash out that 24 dollars making back their original investment, and still be left with a company earning $3 per share annually). 

So as the balance sheet grows, you would expect the share price to grow with it (and subsequently PER too). This is why EV/EBITDA is also popular. It does a better job of capturing shareholder equity."

 - Will a 10-year Tesla investment *beat* benchmarks like VTI/VOO/etc?   

Everyone discussing this says yes to the first two questions then ignores the second two questions. That's the ""gotcha"" with Tesla, you can believe that they're an amazing company with a bright future and yet still avoid them at the current price.

Tesla already only makes money thanks to government subsidies, and every competitor that comes out will only serve to make it that much harder.

If you want to argue that they, and they alone will crack autonomous driving, or will in some other way have a breakthrough that no one else can match, that's a different argument, and that's fine.

2021-05-13 15:49:58,stocks,Good to know. Thanks for clarifying.
2021-05-13 17:09:37,stocks,Not really. I've never (unfortunately I guess) invested into magic internet money. I have no technical knowledge whatsoever when it comes to crypto.
2021-05-13 15:35:55,stocks,"Depends on how soon Tesla could lower their production costs and release cheaper models, like iPhone SE taking market share from Xiaomi phones, the same with those Chinese low quality EV brands."
2021-05-13 15:06:42,stocks,Agreed. The plan would be to keep it for 5-10 years.
2021-05-13 19:08:06,stocks,"hahah So true. I was warned of ""nio"" coming for tesla. I'm actually asking, not even trying to be difficult. Is there any american, or german ( just for kicks) product that you would decide to by the Chinese copy of?  The chinese don't make shit of their own, they make a cheaper version of someonelese's engineering. Or you can go and get a VW bettle all eclectic. But I wouldn't choose the bettle vs the model 3,Y,X, or any of them lol"

Diversify, ETF ( which by the way is just one stock that's made out of 50 stocks, it's safe but you might not make a killing). Also, lol don't aim to make a killing. It's not a game. 8-10% is a great return per year. Anything more is a bonus. Buy stocks of companies you believe in. If you look up a Compound Interest Calculator  there is one on [investor.gov](https://investor.gov) but you can just google it. Put in the 25k with a 8% annual rate. See where you will be in 5/10 years. You can try 10-15% for fun to see. It's impressive. Just get started and hold through the panic times. Also, always remember the trend is your friend. Look at a 1,3,5,10 year chart. If the chart is moving upwards ( like Visa, Apple, Amazon, Tesla ) then you should be fine. All those dips that seem huge at the time look like tiny little nothings in the big pic. good luck hope this helps. Have had a tesla, and then bought the stock since 2018. Everyone said it was crap. Made double 7 figures on it....lol"

>Total Assets 3,637,268

>Goodwill 1,540,915

>*Note: the numbers just changed apparently probably from this update*

Lot's of people make fun of us value nerds, but when Goodwill makes up nearly half of your total assets, and you're PE is > 80, you're just trading baseball cards and calling them stocks. 

Add on to that the fact that Apple is planning to kill users-are-the-product style companies.

If there is value here, I can't find it."

2021-05-13 16:30:56,stocks,"In my non expert opinion it is the new norm for this earnings season and maybe next. Macro environment is far to scary for big money to not sell off at any small amount of bad news. A company could beat 9/10 tracked metrics, but sell off because that 10th one missed by the smallest amount."
2021-05-13 17:49:47,stocks,We're in a tech bear market where multiples are compressing everywhere.
2021-05-13 18:23:52,stocks,Good earnings was probably priced in. I think their current valuation is fair considering the earnings.

2021-05-13 18:44:36,stocks,"If you haven't caught on... if it's a ""growth"" stock then it is market poison right now.  Only tech getting a bounce after these gashes is big tech that is fairly established with good earnings and slower growth and essentially blue chippers.  I keep thinking my small cap tech stocks and other growth stocks can't go any lower... but when they trade at crazy multiples based on assumptions, it's easy to collapse when there aren't definitive earnings propping the price up and establishing a real floor."

2021-05-13 14:08:26,stocks,"As a guy, I can see the concept being somewhat interesting, but I went on bumble, and I'm not an online dating guy normally, but the problem with women talking first is that the guy loses attention way to quickly. When you match a girl, and they don't message you for 24 hrs, you kind of forget about the app in general. I just invested in 25 stocks to sell when the dip is over, gl me. but I wouldn't ever invest in this company normally."
2021-05-13 14:10:23,stocks,"In the current climate, earnings are weighed much less than prevailing conditions such as inflation. Long term will probably be fine, but short term traders probably won‚Äôt find much upside in tech while inflation and potential of elevated rates is still in the crosshairs.

It took me losing a couple options to learn why short term is difficult to pull off consistently. Prevailing market conditions outweigh individual company health on day to day moves. If you fixate on the company without factoring in the whole, even if the company does everything correctly, short term trades can easily backfire. For the long term, market conditions are likely to weigh less on overall gains vs individual company performance."
2021-05-13 14:21:29,stocks,I met my Girlfriend on bumble and I have four friends who also met their spouse on it (and I have like 10 freinds total so that's a huge proportion lol). Granted we all did that 3/4 years ago.

Best case scenario this fear will last until Q3 or Q4.

2021-05-13 19:10:17,stocks,"I think about it something like this

A) There's a high chance inflation fears are overblown and people have discounted tech by way too much.

B) There's a low chance inflation is about to go out of control, interest rates are about to rocket, and we are going to see the mother of all market meltdowns

In situation A, which I think is highly likely, you clean up well

In situation B, which is unlikely IMO, you just went all in before the mother of all meltdowns.

So IMO, high percentage chance that buying tech works out quite nicely for you, but a small chance it's the financial mistake of a lifetime

just my 2 cents"

If say Amazon, Procter and Gamble, or BRK were to be down 50% from their highs then the ‚Äúhow much lower can these realistically go‚Äù is valid because they have actual positive cash flows. These software companies are based on future cash flows 5-10 years out based on some very generous assumptions (sales growth will stay high, margins will improve, competitors are unable to keep up). The problem with having a valuation based on far distant cash flows is that if those assumptions turn false, the ‚Äúfloor‚Äù can be 95% from its highs.

So no, these aren‚Äôt bargains just because they are down."

2021-05-13 00:00:00,stocks,"$INVE disrupting NFC, most recently in Needles & Cannabis [Identiv (INVE)](https://files.identiv.com/brochure/Identiv_Brochure.pdf) is a Nasdaq listed small cap growth stock with a solid core business and huge growth pipeline as a leading innovator in Radio-frequency identification ‚ÄúRFID‚Äù, particularly Near-Field Communication ‚ÄúNFC‚Äù. Identiv designs and manufactures millions of low-cost RFID chips that enable the internet of things ‚ÄúIOT‚Äù, offering highly tuned and optimized antennas, systems, software and security. Identiv has been selling [smart ID and perimeter access card systems](https://www.identiv.com/products/physical-access-control/hardware/freedom-access-control-hardware/) to institutions including the [federal government ](https://www.identiv.com/us-government-ficam-solution/)for many years, and is now seeing high growth in [other verticals](https://www.identiv.com/products/rfid-nfc-inlays/hf-inlays-tags/) such as [prescription drugs with CVS](https://www.mobihealthnews.com/news/cvs-pharmacy-app-introduces-feature-people-visual-impairments).

I expect compound annual sales growth of over +20-25% for several years with huge near term upside driven by opportunities in high-tech syringes and cannabis (particularly Canada). The company has recently launched a Developers Kit to help customers find more use cases, for which INVE can prototype quickly. Over the past year, manufacturing capacity has increased +70% from 130 million units to 220 million units, and [management has commented recently](https://www.webcaster4.com/Webcast/Page/2610/40963) ‚ÄúThat's not even a lot of buffer for what we're seeing as our baseline demand‚Äù.

As of 5/12, the stock is trading at $14, a valuation of 3x Enterprise Value / 2022E Forward Sales of $120M. With high visibility for 20-25% sales growth, I believe the stock today is worth $26 based on 5x Forward Sales. If Identiv delivers on their pipeline of smart syringes, cannabis labeling and other innovative products, sales will exceed $250 million by 2024 and the stock will trade \*significantly higher\* than where it is today. As the world gets more digital, I expect INVE will sell billions of NFC tags configured for [countless applications](https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/pdf/the-need-for-enabling-touchless-technologies-whitepaper.pdf).

**Recent updates on Needles --** INVE‚Äôs customer is awaiting FDA approval for smart syringes for which they are targeting 100 million units from INVE with an average selling price of $1-1.50 = $100-150 million opportunity.

**Recent updates on Cannabis --** INVE is also well positioned to capture market share for mandated [RFID tagging of cannabis](https://cannabisindustryjournal.com/tag/rfid/) in Canada and [potentially in the USA](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/02/06/1981126/0/en/Identiv-to-Showcase-NFC-Solutions-at-WestPack-and-First-ever-Cannabis-Packaging-Summit.html) in the future, which is a 1 billion unit opportunity in Canada alone.

[Per May 6, 2021 earnings call](https://www.webcaster4.com/Webcast/Page/2610/40963), ""So, I think, the cannabis one you're referring to which is in the public domain, there's a big opportunity out there. And we mentioned that we've provided sample rolls to them sample products. It's very far along, but it's a government program. You would think they'd want to drive it as fast as possible, because it's going to increase their tax collection capability and certainty. But government programs go with the pace they go. So, it should be hitting in the relatively near-term. But again, with us, if we say it's going to fall in the third quarter or fourth quarter per se, and then it pushes out, that can change expectations. So it's on track, and we're comfortable with the position. We're in there. And it's moving along and they're taking samples and assessing it, but exactly when it becomes mandated is not certain, give or take three to six months.‚Äù

[Per May 6, 2021 earnings call](https://www.webcaster4.com/Webcast/Page/2610/40963) ""Back on this cannabis, 1-billion-unit opportunity. It almost sounds like you sort of won the technology bake out there. Is that a fair characterization? Or is that still going on?""... ""In terms of compliance and ability -- so the short answer is, yes. But to be clear, being a government program, it won't be sole source. Are we pretty -- well, I wanted to not overstate anything, because nothing's been awarded? But, we're certainly at the forefront of those who, more than comply, you completely satisfy everything they're looking for.""

2021-05-13 00:00:00,stocks,"Dividend vs growth comparison Alright, so I am mostly in VTI/index funds but have some dividend stocks as well. I know some people say that dividends don‚Äôt make any sense because stock drops in value and you lose growth. I was trying to figure out how much I would lose in my dividend stocks so I did a very very simple math exercise below. I kind of proved myself wrong here. 

Can you guys take a look and let me know what I got wrong?  I am assuming 15% tax bracket and I am assuming that other growth is identical between these stocks. So I am not factoring that in. I am just reflecting the dividend portion. 

1.  Let‚Äôs say I want to start living off dividends from some of my stocks in 10 years. Let‚Äôs say I have $100 and invest in a 5% div stock and I reinvest it all. But I pay 15% div tax rate every year so I only get to reinvest 4.25% and the other .75% gets lost as tax. 

100*1.0425^10 = $152. So I have $152 and I will start taking my 5% dividends. 

$152*.0425 = $6.46 income per year after 15% div tax. 

2.  Now by contrast I invest in a stock that doesn‚Äôt pay 5% dividend. So everything else being equal it just grows by 5% every year. 

100*1.05^10 = $163.  Obviously higher than $152.  But I then have to sell this growth stock and move it into a dividend stock to start living off my income. I realize long-term capital gains tax which is the same as dividend tax so 15%.

I now have $163*.85 = $139

5% of dividends minus 15% div tax is $139*4.25% = $5.91

Where is my flaw in logic?  Serious question. What am I missing?"
2021-05-13 13:00:39,stocks,There is nothing wrong with your math. Receiving a dividend is a forced taxable event and receiving a dividend completely washes out since the stock price goes down an equal amount.  Whether or not a stock pays a dividend is completely irrelevant to the expected return of that stock.  There is no reason to move money from non dividend stocks to dividend stocks.  The only difference is with non dividend stocks you get to choose when to take your earnings.
2021-05-13 11:51:15,stocks,"Investment decisions should not be made on tax considerations. Let‚Äôs take a look at the assumptions. There are plenty of ‚Äúgrowth‚Äù stocks that don‚Äôt grow and instead crater. We are seeing that now. In contrast, there are ‚Äúdividend‚Äù stocks, which represent mature companies which also grow and pay a dividend. If someone is looking for the possibility of fast money, they can choose ‚Äúgrowth.‚Äù If someone wants more security, then they can find companies which grow and pay a dividend. At the end of the day, taxes are taxes and whether you pay on dividends or realized capital gains, it‚Äôs all pretty much the same."
2021-05-13 11:45:47,stocks,Someone says ‚Äúdividends don‚Äôt make sense‚Äù? That person is an idiot.

2021-05-13 14:09:17,stocks,It is the same. Long term capital gains are taxed the same as dividends.
2021-05-13 18:04:21,stocks,"There are actually qualified dividends (taxed at LTCG) and just dividends (taxed at income), a dividend becomes qualified if you hold the stock for (60+? days, changes for preferred stock) in most cases dividends are more capital efficient than buybacks, since you would have to hold the stock for longer to receive the LTCG tax rate."
2021-05-13 18:18:36,stocks,Yes thank you. I assumed qualified since this is a long hold example. I hold my REIT and ARCC in ROTH since they are taxed as ordinary.

2021-05-13 11:11:31,stocks,I don't think you should take an example of a particular stock going up and down and then try to extrapolate that into a lesson about when you should buy and sell. A better lesson is to learn not to extrapolate lessons from random variance. You're being fooled by randomness.

2021-05-13 11:08:31,stocks,So depends on your valuation - if you think that this is going to be a 10x stock in 5 years and you have a sense for what catalysts need to happen and what earnings need to look like then wait for those events... if there is a correction/bump figure out why and if it lines up with your thesis... if you think it‚Äôs just up because of market dynamics and will likely come back down then profit take a bit. All depends on why/how and then how that compares to your expectation of the stock price and valuations - did something change? Does the market know something I don‚Äôt?
2021-05-13 11:40:17,stocks,"I think you‚Äôre in a good place to just keep holding ctxr.

That's different for every company, and dependant on individual analysis. Maybe it's a 10% bump, maybe it's 200%. Assuming nothing about the company changes, it's fair market value remains the same. If the company grows assets in line with stock price growth, you can reevaluate and raise your target price. If it spikes though, you should have a price for overvalued.

I like my 2015 Chevy Equinox, and have no intention of selling it, but it's not worth $25k. If someone offers that to me, I'm selling."
2021-05-13 11:42:28,stocks,Nobody knows when to take the profit. If somebody could predict the stock market they would be the richest in the world. But you know that. Sounds like you are daytrading. There is a good chance you will loose more than win in the longer run. In the case of CTXR I have done the DD and I believe good news and peaks will come. If you invest in a good companies you fell a little better about red days. My advice is to look at what others are saying and doing and do your own DD. The DD and sticking to a company is alpha and omega. Or else your are chasing the profit and buying too late

Unless you got in on the ground floor you risk losing those gains you once loved (see FCEL rise to 27 from 2ish  and back to 8ish over the past  8 months).

CTXR- if you are on the fence you wait until 5/17 ER. Then jump off or stick around.

 If I had sold many of the times I considered and bought back in, I wouldn't have been able to buy back in for anywhere near that average (except for the two days it dipped close to that but I'd need extremely lucky timing)."

Well, the day of when it was going to get delivered, they pushed the delivery date on the app to somewhere in June. There was no trace of the original delivery date at all. The app made it seem like the June delivery date was the date that was given the entire time. Customer service was absolutely no help. This date being pushed back proceeded to happen 3 more times.

So I wonder if anyone has the data on what investors before the IPO paid? Like what is the actual value you think of Bumble, if it had not IPOd during a hype bull market."
2021-05-13 11:28:34,stocks,"It's a terrible investment. The business strategy is predicated on giving women the advantage, when every dating site/app that's been around has already had a massive advantage/tilt in favor of women. The only thing they can run on is ""built by women, for women"".  
   
The issue is their UX is shitty for 50% of the population, and even worse considering that 50% can't even initiate conversation. I've had great dates from Bumble, BUT 70% of my matches lead to the girl not ever messaging me OR just saying ""hey!"" which is a non-starter.  
   
Men make up the vast majority of the online dating scene, and to handicap yourself by not letting them participate equally is bad business. Hinge is *far* superior here in NY. Bumble tried to copy them with prompts, but I expect it to fall flat.  
   
I've heard they also are sketchy about paying users. In that, Tinder and Hinge count a ""paid subscriber"" as someone who actually pays for a monthly subscription. Bumble counts a ""paid subscriber"" as anyone who has ever paid for a single thing on the app in the given time period, even if it was a $2.99 single use item, for example."

Idk, I don't necessarily disagree with you, but I don't think the app is useless either. You also have to be subscribed before you can pretty much use any of the app, so they do have a decent and cost-effective pricing model for their users.

If less people are using their app, maybe that indicates the app is working? Idk... there's a lot to consider with these apps, but I do know their downloads have flat lined in growth a bit so that turned me off from entering this company."

Anyway, I have studied/researched a lot different dating apps etc, and I worked with 1 a few years ago.

I always find Bumble weird investment outliner as you say, like females are already massively in advantage.

One immediate issue I see right away with Bumble is, does it not automatically exclude gay people and other hbtq+ from a business standpoint that sounds bad.

like do you know how it works if you are a gay man? Like how would it even work, can neither then contact each other :;) or as a gay women then both can connect?

Edit:

OK I never used bumble and its really dead(or never been alive where I lived) but now I read some info on it.

It seems to just work like Tinder if u are gay. Seems to just break the premise or w.e then gotta read the fine print to even know that. That just seems like a massive issue, right away I never heard about any non cis using it, like do people know this? And even if they do, it just seems like a very CIS app so to speak and its nothing special with it if u are not. 

I dont know, from a behavioral standpoint I just doubt any non cis will use it. Which for me from an investment standpoint is bad, like e.g I like game stocks. Everyone play games regardless of X right, here is an app that feels very more the ""story"" then actual users / auto misses people."

You're all going on about Airtags and shit. Look at the company as an investment FFS. They are swimming in cash. Their dividend is easily sustainable. They have a loyal to the point of being a cult fan base. They sell upscale electronics to wealthy people, primarily Americans. (Android phones have more users globally but Apple rules the US.) Their profit margins on said products are awesome.

Personally, I can't stand their products. I have used many, and my job forces me to carry an iPhone. Hate it. Don't care - own their stock. It's about 10% of my portfolio. It's a stock you just buy and hold."

In 2018 when Apple was the first company to hit 1T market cap, a time when they were criticised for no innovation, no more growth, they doubled their market caps in just 2 years. Now there‚Äôs more catalysts and I 100% believe there is so much more growth. I‚Äôm at a 2% loss but already tempted to make AAPL closer to 50% of my portfolio.

Don‚Äôt think Apple has technically done anything wrong, and in fact, seemingly played all the right moves, especially with the introduction of the M1 Macs. All signs point to heightened growth, and Apple‚Äôs earnings smashed all expectations. 

However, in the current climate, earnings largely seem to be disregarded, as inflation and other geopolitical events take precedence. Though on the bright side, Apple hasn‚Äôt been hurt as grievously as many tech names out there, so you can certainly do worse. 

My portfolio is just shy of 15% Apple. A little excessive, though I hadn‚Äôt been increasing my position, and I hadn‚Äôt had much Interest in selling either, so its weight slowly declines as I add to the portfolio."

2021-05-13 12:18:21,stocks,It's up today
2021-05-13 11:47:03,stocks,Currently no. The five year estimate if you equalize to average p/e is approx 150.00/share. Thats factoring in share buy backs and 13% (their previous average growth in p/e over 5 years). Next years earnings will make things more appealing but we need a few good years like that to get another 15%/year or so. Otherwise we‚Äôre just playing catch up to the valuation.

2021-05-13 00:00:00,stocks,"Dividend Yield Percetage or Actual Dollar Amount? I am interested in dividends and was wondering if i should buy stocks with high percetage yield or a larger number paid out. Like say i found a stock that pays 5 annually, but the yield is only 2%, and then i found another stock that pays about .70 cents annually, but thats a 10% yield. Which is better?"
2021-05-13 10:05:49,stocks,"The percentage is better because you will be able to buy more shares of the one that pays .70 cents for the same investment amount as the one that is paying more at a flat rate and thus you will still get more money each quarter.  The percentage is the percentage of your investment amount that is coming back to you in dividends.  If you bought $10,000 worth of the stock you would be getting $1,000 a year in dividends from the 10% one and only $200 a year from the 2% one.  However there should be a lot more that goes into your decision besides which one pays the highest dividend like which one is safer, which one is more likely to increase their dividend, which one is more likely to go up in value etc."
2021-05-13 10:06:35,stocks,"Div payout and div yield are related, but div payout is more accurate. Div yield changes literally every day, because it's tied to the stock price, which always changes. If a company commits to the same quarterly dividend throughout its fiscal year (which is common), it might be a 4% yield at the beginning of the year but turn out to only be a 2% yield by the end because the stock price doubled. By looking at the div payout, you know exactly how much dividend to expect for that year/quarter/month and can calculate yourself what that yield is in realtime."
2021-05-13 10:02:36,stocks,"Depends on what you can invest and I would look more into the company rather than just % yield.

A 10% yield on a $5 stock is different than a 10% yield on a $50 stock. The annual $ amount is per 1 share. IMO it is easier to calculate annual dividends with the actual $ amount. 

# of stock shares x annual $ yield = annual dividend 

I currently am in IVR, WMC and BPT all lower priced stock with high yields% . More importantly the companies are solid."
2021-05-13 10:36:29,stocks,"Most of what you asked had already been covered by others.

2021-05-13 10:17:14,stocks,How is a 10% yield on a $5 stock different than a 10% yield on a $50 stock.  They both yield 10%.  The only difference is that you would own 10x as many shares of the $5 stock.

I think musk just saw that Bitcoin is beginning to correct again and decided he either wanted out or he wanted to invest more in. He knows when he tweets about a crypto it either tanks or rockets depending on what he says. Either way, he can now cash out of Bitcoin because he things it‚Äôs ‚Äúharmful‚Äù to the environment, leaving with a good chunk of change from the last major dip he bought in at (mind you this dip took place shortly after one of his negative Twitter rants about Bitcoin, he then stated Tesla would accept it as payment and his new $1.5 billion investment skyrocketed in value on the news) or he‚Äôs trying to get it to dip hard again so he can dump more money.

And I was curious to see if that applies to stocks too. Obviously, if I was able to do a sample size of everyone in the world, and weight it based on how much money they had behind their position, it would absolutely be a correct answer, however, I can't really do that. So, I was wondering how effective a smaller unweighted sample size would be. 

Lets test this out with AT&T (T).

If you think AT&T will be up by 4:30 today(5/13/2021), please say ""up"" followed by the percentage you think it will go up by. If you think it will go down, please say ""down"" followed by the percent you think it will go down by. Obviously, if you want to comment on something else or something in addition that's fine too.

2021-05-13 00:00:00,stocks,"The 'real' value of stocks. So I see a lot of discussion about the value of certain asset classes. Many people think for example that a certain asset class that shall not be named has no real value while stocks have real value because you own a piece of a value creating company. (just an observation, not the point of this discussion) 

My question, why does having partial ownership in a value creating company has value in itself? I would think that that value only exists if that company pays a dividend or if we assume they will at some point start paying a dividend back to it's owners. 

So let's say I take my company public but the issued shares will never be able to receive a dividend. Would that mean my shares have no real value, thus following popular believe should be prices at zero?

As a shareholder, you're a part owner of this business. Not symbolically, it's yours. If the company were to liquidate all assets, pay off all liabilities, and close up shop, you would be entitled to your share of the proceeds. Thus, businesses, and shares, have real value.

2021-05-13 09:51:00,stocks,"The notion that a profitable company will never pay a dividend is your problem.  Unless you had a company where an insane inside owner wanted to run it into the ground there is always the possibility of a future dividend.  Lets say that this non-dividend paying company which is profitable and has real returns has its price drop because everyone agreed that no dividends meant it was worthless.  There would be intense pressure from the board to do something about that like maybe declare a dividend.  If the company was still severely undervalued there would be takeover attempts or mergers or something where other investors or companies tried to get a hold of this business that was generating profits.  That new entity could then start issuing dividends.  The reason companies that are profitable don't issue dividends is because they feel that the money used for dividends can be better spent on growth or stock buybacks or acquisitions etc.  Worse case scenario that money is just piling up somewhere that it can still be unlocked later when management changes.  If any entity decided to buy up all the shares and take it private they would still get all the money that has been piling up as well as all of the future earnings that they could keep and would essentially be paying a dividend to themselves.  This is what gives that company value because there will always be people willing to buy a profitable company and take it private it it was cheap enough.  The fact that they would also have to buy your shares to do this is what gives your shares value.  The fact that people will compete to do this is what keeps that value from dropping too far below the intrinsic value of the stock.  Sure you could come up with an example of a company where enough shares are controlled by a crazy person to make that not possible but then just don't invest in those companies.

On the other hand your other asset is only worth what people are willing to pay for it and if people no longer wanted to buy it it would be worthless and even if you could buy 100% of the outstanding shares/coins (and essentially take it private) they would still not be worth anything.  

&#x200B;

It isn't the dividends that make it worth anything (that is just the easiest way to extract the value) it is the profits which is real money coming in that are waiting to be used as well as the prospect of future profits in ensuing years not counting as you mentioned the assets the company holds."
2021-05-13 00:00:00,stocks,"A couple of questions. Hello, I keep asking myself some questions but I would appreciate it if someone takes from their time to answer me.

Why doesn't the FED stop printing money now- maybe not at once but very firmly and steadily? Why doesn't Biden cut all the ""stimulus"" check- moneys- like if you know that your nation is getting more money doing nothing rather than working- things are not looking good chief. Why are interest rates still so low?

I keep a couple of shares in Walmart, Disney, Pepsi, Abbvie and Procter and Gamble, I know we are in probably a correction rather than crash, but it sucks seeing those investment money getting slowly down."
2021-05-13 08:44:13,stocks,"You don‚Äôt seem to understand how the macro economy works on a larger stage. Additionally this market correction is due to the fear of inflation and not actual inflation, at least not to the degree that justifies the sell offs we‚Äôve been seeing. 

Biden isnt cutting the stimulus checks because they aren‚Äôt any more for him to cut? Last I checked there‚Äôs been discussion of maybe another one but that‚Äôs basically it. The unemployment extension that I think you are trying to refer to is a different matter. And yeah you are right, getting paid more from unemployment than you did while working isn‚Äôt right, these jobs need to be paying more and offering more in terms of benefits and incentives to fill all these jobs that have historically been thankless and thought of lesser but at the end of the day were some of the first to be labeled as essential. Start by raising the minimum wage to match the C.O.L and watch how fast people come back to work."
2021-05-13 08:52:31,stocks,"Despite what you read online, people still need fiat. People are and were really struggling. ""Printing"" money isn't as bad as people are suggesting. Many countries had better ""stimulus"" programs than the USA. Both sides of the aisle wanted stimmys. The inflation was sort of expected. Would you really want to cut those people off? It's not as simple as let's not cut them any more checks. A lot of UI is not do to laziness, it's not usually the employees fault. 

Also, the inflation report was most likely inflated itself due to supply constraints that arose from COVID - e.g. semiconductors + lumber."

2021-05-13 00:00:00,stocks,"Anyone else feeling cautiously optimistic? By and large my portfolio has been on a healthy upwards trajectory. This weeks dips in my opinion are healthy. It‚Äôs impossible for stocks to go up indefinitely- there have to be pullbacks to test resistance levels and entice new buyers. That is what I think we are seeing. When the turbulence settles I believe we will resume the growth trend we have been on. This can be seen as a display of the old axiom buy when others are fearful, sell when others are greedy. Perhaps we are just moving through that greedy stage and on to the fearful. 

Unfortunately I do not have excess capital to buy so my plan is to hold. But I think there is certainly an argument to make that this is a buying opportunity and that dips are healthy for a growing market."

2021-05-13 18:03:13,stocks,"This is a garden variety pullback. Look at history- there are several of these every year. And every time, people freak out and wonder if there‚Äôs further to fall. Once that fear hits a certain threshold, the upward trajectory continues. Bookmark this and watch what happens the next time there‚Äôs a 5-10% pullback."
2021-05-13 08:31:42,stocks,"Truth is the more of these sell offs you see, the more confidence you'll have in the long term. You don't have to buy every dip. You'll find the benefits are actually most apparent in your investment maturity. That's transferrable to all other ventures beyond the stockmarket."
2021-05-13 08:30:26,stocks,"Depends on the reason for the pullback. It's definitely healthy for some pullback, it just depends on if were seeing more shift on top of it. 

Imo what were seeing this week is largely retail driven. The spikes are coming at the emotional moments of the day and the wind is out of the sails on any reddit stocks. The institutions were sitting on cash so it's not them selling, they shorted it all and they're covering at least half those positions if not most of them.

Propaganda feed is selling us fear while telling us to buy which is really confusing for newer investors. Pipeline is fixed but it's small news in comparison to when it got shutdown temporarily and wasnt really a big deal. They're selling inflation hard too when we knew there would be some, the fed themselves said theyd be fine with 2% over and that's about where it was. 

I'm optimistic once the sellers sell, I'm just not sure we've reached that point yet.  Every day I see more posts of people saying they got out. I was mostly liquid so I'm buying a little but I'm also not convinced retail is done being afraid, if this continues through Friday and they let people panic all weekend it could get bad Monday. 

Call me extremely cautious and sort of optimistic."

Once we start seeing better stability in the VIX and it starts it‚Äôs decline again is when I plan to start ‚Äúbuying the dip‚Äù. Overall I think it‚Äôs a healthy trend and was long overdue. But even once it settles down I don‚Äôt expect to have anywhere near the runnup we had last year, this will be much slower and more gradual. That type of movement happens on daily and weekly charts all the time (a large gap up followed by a significant drop with a gradual return) your just seeing it more on a macro level now so it feels worse."

I felt it was topical because this week there has been a lot of concerns specifically around inflation and what it might due to the market. My point was pullbacks are regular and healthy for the market and don‚Äôt have to be attributed to some sinister force.

2021-05-13 08:35:50,stocks,"Fair enough. At the end of the day it‚Äôs impossible to tell a healthy dip from a larger trend until it happens. And I agree about the retail piece. I think there is a lot of fear and confusion particularly among newer retail investors.

I don‚Äôt tend to think it‚Äôs quite so malicious though, more a victim of our media culture. I don‚Äôt really believe that most information is driven by bad actors trying to move markets or push a narrative. I just think sensationalism draws views. So everything becomes hyperbole and panic can easily take hold among a mass of people who aren‚Äôt equipped to dismiss it.

Which is what lead me to post. I keep seeing a lot of doom and gloom but I‚Äôm frankly overall optimistic. I think both the economy and markets are set for a boom over the next 18 months.

2021-05-13 08:16:52,stocks,Premarket price action is just ridiculous. EPS miss was solely due to the fine.
2021-05-13 08:24:19,stocks,"This stock will be 3x the current value in 5 years,  without the fine we would have a better eps, if people are intelligent they buy this stock. At the current price it is a steal!"
2021-05-13 09:02:07,stocks,"If you're asking why Alibaba earned 22bn in Net income and is trading at 26pe ratio with 30% growth and it's down the reason is below:

People aren't focusing on the PE ratio or the fine. It's because a lot of their profit comes from investment income.

We've gone from a bull to bear market, and China is watching Alibaba's investments like a hawk.

Another company that also has lots of income from investments is Softbank who reported their results too.

Softbank's Net income was a whopping 46bn for the year - which is higher than FB and GOOGL.

But why is it trading at just 135bn market cap? Because of that 46bn income, a lot of it comes from trading other companies. Their vision fund segment. It's not income that consistently repeats itself every year.

They made like 40bn alone from that segment. Their softbank business - the one with recurring income, made 7.7bn before tax and their ARM segment made a loss.

Alibaba made half of their income from recurring operations and half from investments. So their PE based on their consistent, recurring income is 51.

What multiple should the investment side be? 

For softbank, if we calculated based on their total net income their PE is just 3. But no one calculates based off investment returns repeating. If we base their PE on the recurring income, its closer to 20.

That's why you can't use straight PE for companies that make significant amounts of money from investments. Investment side of the business, PE can't be more than 20 IMO. Probably closer to 10x for an average return year. A killer quarter (like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley), investors don't push up the price as they don't expect super good years to repeat itself.

Just for reference, Alibaba non-operational income over the years: 51, 10, 27, 48, 79, 80. It can jump all over the place throwing out PE ratio."

AMZN had 37% growth in fiscal 2020 - PE is 60. 44% growth for the quarter.

FB has 21% growth in fiscal 2020 - PE is 30. 47% growth for the quarter.

BABA had 40% growth in fiscal 2020. 64% growth for the quarter.

10 PE for their investment business means their main business is 42 PE. But in any case, you would expect their PE to be a lot higher given their growth. (The more you value their investment business, the less you value their main business)

That's where margins come in.

AMZN's gross margins have improved over the years (5% vs 5 years ago)

FB gross margins have deteriorated. 

Which camp does BABA fall into?

Weakening margins.

They had 33% gross margin for the quarter, and 41% for the year.

5 years ago they had 66% gross margins. Last year they had 45% gross margins.

First of all thank you for all your suggestions last time I created a post. I used your tips and current swing is much less nerve wrecking for me.

I was wondering - with markets falling and streets going red again, what are your current moves? Hold and don‚Äôt inject money into the market now, leave  the market and wait for better days or BTD (buy the dip)?

As for me: I just hold and don‚Äôt check my portfolio. I‚Äôm tech heavy, out of money to buy the dips, and too red to sell and take the loss.

My portfolio: ARKK, AAPL, MSFT, TSM, NERD, VWRA, AABB

Most of them bought at almost ATH."

Obviously, some corrections will be bigger than others: meme stocks like GME, AMC will be hit the hardest, cryptos will also suffer 2nd, separating the shit ones from the actual good ones. Lastly, growth stocks will take a hit, but nothing major, especially if their business model didn't rely on a once in a lifetime pandemic to be succesful. I wouldn't be too worried to be honest.

2021-05-13 06:52:03,stocks,Lol ok dip is over
2021-05-13 06:35:37,stocks,"I‚Äôm in the same boat. Sold $200k of growth funds plus rolled over $850k from my 401(k), all one day before the inflation report. I have never had so much money sitting in cash. 

Already put about $90k into SCHD and SPYD, a little prematurely as the market is still in decline. But those plus a total market fund/ETF are where the rest is going soon."
2021-05-13 10:27:21,stocks,"So, there are going to be a lot of ""time in the market beats timing the market"" comments around, and that's generally a good philosophy.  Nobody knows whether we're going to see a major correction in the short term, and we don't know what's going to happen when some of the stimulative/relief measures are reduced.  However, I'd say that it's likely that the *economy* is going to do quite well over the next couple of years -- pent up demand, high current savings rate, strong continued government support.  That doesn't mean the market will perform well -- at these prices, stocks seem to be pricing in all of this and more already.

But pulling out of the market -- what drove you to do it? Do you have a need for that $450k in the near term such that if it was priced downward, you would have a cash crunch? Or is it the psychological hit of seeing that $450k go to $300k on the brokerage screen?  If it's the latter, I'd ask: what was your basis and your expectations? If your basis was $200k 4 years ago and you wanted to do a 10% annual return, a drop to $300k is still in line with your goals! I like to think about the trend line I'm trying to achieve...sometimes the market will price above it and sometime below it, but if the long term is on or above the line, then I'm still doing what I set out to do.  Sure, if you KNOW when the market is going to drop, you want to realize unrealized gains, but nobody knows that for sure.

But now you're out, and given the CAPE ratio and historical performance at this point, I wouldn't put a new investment into lots of things at these price points.  But there are still reasonably priced things out there.  Look at BMY and AMGN in healthcare.  EPD in energy.  I can't believe I'm saying it, but AMZN looks reasonable given where it historically trades against operating cash flow.  I found a bunch of things in energy/banking/insurance last fall that looked underpriced, but I can't recommend many of them now because they are all up about 100% in the last 8 months. 

Most things do look overpriced...everyone who says AAPL and MSFT must be using a much lower discount rate than I am in their DCFs.  Look around though and decide what prices make sense for *your* goals, a DCF, and decide to buy based on that."

I only have 25K in the market so not near as big as you but it's most of what I have to invest so it does weigh on my mind about the same as yours I'd think? Anyways, I'm looking at top index funds and REITs to get back in. No more speculative stocks for me. üôÖ Do you have rental properties that you have setup with AirBnB? My dad and coworker do so I've been learning a lot about them in the past few months. If you have the capital then that seems like the best investment over the long run. They hold value even during a crash. Even ""Tiny Houses"" the little box like houses that started trending a few years ago are booked year round on the AirBnB website for about $100-200 a night. They cost anywhere from 20K-40K to be completely setup and furnished. Put them in good spots like near lakes or with mountain views. Or even near National landmarks and they'll be booked up. Sorry for the long response. You're obviously older and probably smarter than me seeing the difference in our capital but just thought I'd throw my thoughts out there. I'm a Wind Technician in his mid 20s but not completely ignorant or at least I'd like to think so."

In the case of semiconductors, why have those companies struggled so much in the wake of the shortage? Just a ‚Äúcoming back down to earth from high valuations‚Äù type thing or is there something i‚Äôm missing?"

Article from May 3:

> Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh isn‚Äôt focusing not on the chip shortage. He‚Äôs taking notice of NIO‚Äôs stronger-than-forecast profit margins and plans for future capacity. The company announced this past week that it is participating in NeoPark, an industrial complex built in part by the government, that will eventually have the capacity to manufacture 1 million EVs annually. In a Sunday research report, Rakesh raised his price target to $65 a share from $60. He rates NIO shares Buy.

> J.P. Morgan analyst Nick Lai, in a Friday research report, called NIO‚Äôs results ‚Äúa clean beat in the midst of industry headwinds.‚Äù He noted that sales grew faster than unit deliveries because of higher-priced features such as a larger battery pack and upgraded driver assistance functions. Lai also rates shares Buy. His price target is $70 a share.

> Morgan Stanley analyst Tim Hsiao rates share Buy; his price target is $64 a share. He was encouraged by management comments that orders grew nicely in April, but expressed some concern about semiconductor-induced production bottlenecks. ‚ÄúPrevious production suspension may dent near [term] deliveries, making [the second quarter] more back end loaded,‚Äù wrote Hsiao in a Friday report."

go ahead and downvote, you guys thought NIO would never EVER reach sub 30 and we are headed straight there fast.

2021-05-13 09:55:44,stocks,"Essentially, inflation is a price rise compared to a point in time. It can be either demand-pull or cost-push. Demand pull is from an increase in demand, while cost-push is on the supply side where it is more expensive on their end now. This may be due to a rise in wages or a short term supply shock. It can be argued that it is both in this scenario, demand is higher because of quantitve easing by the government and the lowering of the central bank rate with bond purchases causing an increase in the money supply. But, there has also been supply side shocks as well due to covid. Honestly, this feels more like stagflation than anthing to me right now, which is a scenario in which inflation rises but economic output is relatively similar to the year before."

I was impressed by their purchase of both Star Wars and Marvel, and the catalog they've built across movies and tv with old franchises. Theme parks were the core of their businesses before the pandemic, but they quickly shifted to make streaming a priority and it worked. That's after they invested millions in new park attractions that were mostly empty. 

I just read that their subscriber numbers have slowed down, but parks are set to fully reopen with relaxed health restrictions in time for summer. That could mean higher park attendance. Films could also be heading back to theaters, which means box office receipts instead of just streaming. There's a whole Marvel slate planned through 2022. I see a lot of upside for the company."

2021-05-13 12:00:04,stocks,"Disney was $135 a share feb 2020, before covid crash. It had been $150 a share in November 2019 (ATH's pre-covid).

That was all before Dis+. A service with 100million+ subscribers as of last earnings.

Assuming Disney parks/themes/cruises are priced the same as before covid *(which is understating as most reopening plays like cruises and airlines are above pre-covid levels adjusting for new issued shares),* Disney+ is valued at $30 a share (assuming DIS at $180), which is $54.6Bn. NFLX has \~200million subscribers with a marketcap of 215Bn.

DIS+ will only grow its subscriber count, and I believe theres a lot of pent up demand for Disney theme parks and cruises once things actually reopen. Due to all of this, I believe Disney is either fairly valued or undervalued...we'll see in todays earnings call."

2021-05-13 08:13:43,stocks,One thing to do is sell a part of your position at a pop then buy back in when it falls. Thing that makes this strategy hard is there haven't been many green days to recover losses if you bought stocks at the top in 2021.
2021-05-13 08:16:49,stocks,Let's say you buy 1 stock for $5 and it goes up to $10. You can sell your initial investment of $5 and let the remaining $5 to do it's own thing.

2021-05-13 16:35:56,stocks,I had started building a VT position leading into this week (have sat on my hands and bought nothing so far this week).

Are you saying my investment accounts should be mostly etfs? If so I might not disagree, my individual stock picks (outside of GME) have largely gotten clobbered this year"
2021-05-13 13:14:43,stocks,I think we have to wait for a clear bottom.  I don‚Äôt have the money to keep buying the dip.  But I have to think when growth and riskier assets come back into play they will bounce back hard.  Or else we are financially ruined.

I am holding these two so I only know about them. I am assuming similar with others. They are still very low. And yes, maybe in 5-10 years I need to revalue them.  But pretty comfortable now.

Minimal profit now is worth more to me than even a 50% profit gain in 5 years will mean for me, especially considering I bought in low volume."

2021-05-13 10:35:50,stocks,I think it's hard to say how much of what you should have. But a safe bet is following the Boglehead 3 fund portfolio and holding 5-8 tickers. Personally I have 70% of my money in a 3 fund portfolio and the rest in stock picking and so far it's been good to me

Meanwhile companies like Tesla have a 1000 P/E ratio, nvidia with 90. Disney is established and has potential to grow even more on the global market as countries develop. They invest heavily in IP within entertainment that is high in demand. They have made a lot of smart choices. At times of no growth or pandemic yes they axe the dividend, but at least they pay something. Unlike Apple coming out with a new similar looking phone or with them floating on rumors that they will be making ev vehicles."

2021-05-13 14:38:04,stocks,and decrease in supply = higher prices also causes oil to fall as it did earlier in the week?

It's a deep issue and the stimulus, while necessary, is just a band-aid in the long run.

It's a tough question and I don't blame Biden for it, not at all.  I'm just saying that we should be examining how our government (and the Fed) have responded and what impact that has in the short and long term.  Short term it seems like the worst is over, but long-term let's see."

Some back story on me, I am a 20 year old real estate investor who sold off his stock portfolio at 18 when he got into real estate. However, I fully intend on re-entering equities no later than by the time I am 25. In the mean time, I‚Äôve been doing research on different companies (fidelity, schwab etc) and different investment strategies. So far, I am leaning towards choosing fidelity as my brokerage. HOWEVER, this reduced interest thing sounds like it could be hugely beneficial to me as real estate will always be a large percentage of my portfolio.
What I‚Äôm asking for is for anybody to share any expierences they‚Äôve had with either this specific Schwab program or with the company in general.
Specifically, I would like to know:
1. Is there a limit to how many discounted morgages you can carry?
2. Is 20% down adequate for these loans or would you have to put down more to reap the full discounted benefits?
3. What is the approval like for this program? Is a 720 credit score adequate? Do you need above average DTI ratio or other metrics?
4. In general, is this program worth choosing Schwab for, assuming you take full advantage of it?

I‚Äôm planning to have above a million in assets invested in whichever brokerage I choose at some point in my life which would qualify me to take advantage of the .5% off morgage rates. I doubt I will reach the 5 million mark, but you never know!

2021-05-13 00:00:00,stocks,"Toyota Expects To Sell About 8 Million Electrified Vehicles Globally By 2030 *(RTTNews) - Toyota Motor Corp. (TYT.L,TM) said Wednesday that it is committed to making battery electric vehicles or BEVs. It expects to sell about 8 million electrified vehicles globally by 2030, of which 2 million will be battery electric vehicles and fuel cell electric vehicles.*

*The company expects battery electric vehicles and fuel cell electric vehicles will make up 15% of U.S. sales by 2030, and along with the company's hybrids and plug-in hybrids, 70% of the Toyota and Lexus combined sales mix will be electrified by 2030.*

*Earlier in 2021, Lexus unveiled the LF-Z, a conceptual look at the future of BEVs in the luxury segment. That was followed by the debut of the Toyota bZ4X concept, a battery electric SUV that will go into production in 2022.*

Source:
https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/toyota-expects-to-sell-about-8-million-electrified-vehicles-globally-by-2030-2021-05-12

---------------------

Two million EVs AND fuel cell vehicles in 2030 is an absolutely shockingly low number. Also, who do they think they will be selling these 6 million hybrid vehicles to? By 2030, EVs will be significantly cheaper than hybrid cars due to the expected battery cost decline of 60-80% this decade. Why would 75% of their customers pay more for a worse product?

How big do you guys think the chance is that Toyota - currently the largest automaker in the world - will become the next Nokia? Personally, I'm starting to think that it's incredibly likely they will go bankrupt or be just a shell of their former self."
2021-05-13 06:50:53,stocks,"i think its fair to say that 2030 is a somewhat conservative, but really realistic timeframe. 

if anyone really thinks the markets , infrastructure, customer sentiment will change in thenext 2-5 years, they need to wake up. 

central europe - as an example - probably has the most advanced and stable electrical infrastructure in the world. yet, its nowhere near capable of supplying an ""all EV demand.""

and its not the charging stations that are lacking (well, not only them) but the infrastructure needed to supply enough charging stations. 

add to that the battery issues of longevity, performance fluctuations depending omn temperature levels, recycling of batteries, limited materials for those batteries... 

there needs to be significant improvements in all of these aspects to be made for EV to really provide an alternative. 

the environmental impact of EV¬¥s - compared to ICE cars is far worse. EV¬¥s will not be the end all be all solution to the planets eco- and energy problems. 

EV tech and TSLA as the flagbearer - in my personal oppinion- is nothing more than a wakeup call and proof of concept that a whole indusry COULD change faster than expected. if enough pressure is applied. 

if enough pressure would be applied, we would find even better eco-friendly alternatives in a ""heartbeat"". but society, politics and industrial lobbying simply does not apply enough pressure."

Batteries are the most expensive part of an EV, even more so then the engine. It's why EV's cost more then a gasoline vehicle. The cheaper batteries become the cheaper and more affordable EVs get. Analysts believe that once a battery hits the $100 a kw/h mark it'll achieve price parity with gasoline vehicles without any government subsidies. And the batteries will almost certainly continue to get cheaper from there as we improve on the technology farther.

So take a look at the falling costs of batteries overtime. And then take a look at analyst estimates of when batteries will hit cost parity with gasoline vehicles. Even the most conservative analysts expect that to happen in the next 5 years, some expect it to happen in late 2021, this year.

Now answer me this, once EVs are cheaper, who would want to throw money away on a more expensive gasoline vehicle? It gets worse when you look at how EV's are cheaper maintain (due to less moving parts) and cheaper to fuel (electricity is much cheaper than gas even in times when electricity is expensive and gas is cheap).

The new car market is going to be taken over by EV's much sooner then many analysts think imo. Analysts have consistently under-estimated how fast EVs will catch on."

If they are selling only 15% fully electric in 2030, that means that the stock of 'affordable' cars is still going to be mostly ICE into 2035-2040, and likely much longer since they cannot instantly ramp up to 100% fully electric.

2021-05-13 10:38:43,stocks,"I have googled for that quite intensively actually, but I haven't found any credible research suggesting that. We can already recycle batteries up to 98%, and everything else in an EV is comparable to parts of an ICE in terms of reusing or recycling. The problem is not with the technology, it's with the adoption. The only thing we need is some companies to do this in mass scale, like Redwood Materials for example."

And no, they can't just ""adapt their sales projections"". If they want to sell at least 8 million BEVs by 2030, they need to start planning for it TODAY. They can't just decide in 2025 that they were wrong and flip a switch to sell more EVs. It'll be too late by that point."
2021-05-13 10:33:50,stocks,"You should really do some actual research instead of ""one google search"" before you start spewing bullshit online.

> main ingredients so far are lithium, nickel and cobalt (among others) .

Lithium is less than 1% of the battery. Cobalt is being phased out (at least by Tesla). Nickel is the only one that is actually significant in your list, and we have about 800,000 years worth of supplies left of that assuming NO recycling. Realistically, we will recycle 99% of the battery materials we use 10-20 years from now.

Which brings me to the same point as before; we have a clear path towards 100% recycling batteries. This will be achieved most probably in the next 10 years, but definitely in the next 20. That means the more EVs we produce, the fewer new resources we'll have to mine long term and the cheaper EVs become (as it's cheaper to recycle batteries than mine for new materials). So yes, at lot less limited than oil."

We'll need to replace all the batteries at least once in the life of the bus. recycling is very important for us and it is possible. Problem so far is there is not enough volume of batteries to justify to build a recycling factory.. but it is coming and it won't be a choice because there will be a lack of chemical product (lithium, cobalt,phosphate..) soon."
2021-05-13 10:46:26,stocks,You are probably correct regarding the recycle part.. The biggest problem is still infrastructure when it comes to EVs (especially in north america).

2021-05-13 18:52:19,stocks,"I'm not sure exactly how much cheaper hybrids are in maintenace, but it does sound a little like they somehow forgot about the maintenance of an ICE car which is certainly higher. Maybe with a hybrid the cost of replacing the battery is so high that it offsets all the other costs, that could be true.

I do know an EV is much cheaper in maintenance than either. For one, you don't need a clutch (which is something that tends to wear quickly) and your brakes almost never need replacing if you're using regenerative braking. I'm also guessing the battery should last a lot longer since they'll be higher quality (at least in a Tesla) and spend less time being below 20% or above 80% charged."
2021-05-13 13:23:38,stocks,"Toyota will be squeezed from the bottom because of cheaper Chinese EV makers, if they manage to sell cheap cars in North America and/or Europe."
2021-05-13 10:57:23,stocks,"Yep, I agree with that. Especially the electricity grids that will be overloaded and become unstable if everyone would suddenly own an EV. I just hope energy companies and governments will realize the chances they need to make earlier than companies like Toyota/BMW, or that home batteries like Tesla's Powerwall will be sufficient."
2021-05-13 10:55:31,stocks,"Definitely! I also wouldn't be surprised if Toyoda's recent criticism of EVs was just to delay the transition and give his company more time to milk ICE/hybrid cars, and he's obviously not a man with little influence."

2021-05-13 00:00:00,stocks,"Best chip shortage play? I‚Äôm still very new to investing. Wrapping up my first year. Seen around a 250% increase so far. 

But I‚Äôm still discovering and learning about so many companies, good and bad. I‚Äôve done a little digging (literally 20-30 mins) into looking into a good choice to get into for the microchip shortage. 

And I was wondering what are some you all like or are looking at? 

So far I think, Intel and $TSM seem to be the best options. TSM is one of the top semiconductor stocks. Intel is well, Intel. Been around and will be around for awhile. Only knock on Intel, is they are no longer working with Apple. But should still have an impact in supplying chips. Are there any others ones I should add to my list?"
2021-05-13 05:10:10,stocks,"TSM for me, ahead of the competition and a significant expansion in the US. Flip side is the CCP trying to invade Taiwan, but I believe it‚Äôs more posturing than anything, so am not overly concerned. Good price right now too‚Ä¶

Intel, I‚Äôd rather skip for multiple reasons‚Ä¶"
2021-05-13 06:58:56,stocks,"Intel itself has still problems with their production. They won't benefit regarding the chip shortage.

Their 10nm process seems to have a really bad yield and 7nm is still  1+ year away.

My bet is on MU and TSMC."
2021-05-13 05:38:03,stocks,Maybe NVIDIA and AMD. Though just stick to TSM. Ignore the chip shortage play and just try to pick the one with good long term prospects. Stay away from Intel.
2021-05-13 05:58:53,stocks,"Aside from the more obvious TSM, NVDA and AMD, there's also  AMAT, LRCX, ASML and TER as semiconductor fab plays.

I'd maybe be slightly cautious of TSM in the short term as they're already over capacity, so upside is limited, but very decent long term as they expand into a US fab.

This is where AMAT, LRCX, ASML and TER come into play; they should gain when any chip fab expands, be it Intel, TSMC or Samsung.

Another one to watch is UMC, they're kinda like TSM's baby brother; they're well behind on the fab tech, but don't rule them out.  They got battered yesterday, but I feel will rebound well."

2021-05-13 06:45:30,stocks,"Yup TSM is THE fab, apple uses it amd uses it intel wants to use it, if it wasn‚Äôt for the one China BS I would have dumped everything into it a few months back. The political tensions are keeping its price in heavy check. The real news will be how intel handle its new fabs, intel is actively behind Samsung and TSM, if I were to bet anyone beating TSM it would be Samsung, but they also make a lot of other things then just chips so I‚Äôm sure there is a level of expertise at TSM."
2021-05-13 00:00:00,stocks,"So tech is rotating to value. Can value sustain the rotation long term? Ok.  So I understand that the money is coming from the overbought tech names, and in the no earning high multiples, rightfully so, and going into the ""value"" ""cyclicals"", whatever those are.

It of course seems to be coming from most tech and growth though regardless, just more so from SQ and names like that.

I understand it's mostly going or has gone into banks, materials, cyclicals.

I'm sure this will work in the short term with the reopening (let's see how that goes) and infrastructure spending, but do you think these companies can sustain earnings for another 5 years or will the money eventually find its way back to tech names?

I'm assuming though that people will be very cautious around certain tech growth names though maybe for a year or two, so they will take a while to get close to where they were."

2021-05-13 00:00:00,stocks,"Would it make sense to buy SQQQ now while the market is hot and flip it into TQQQ after a crash? Edit: It looks like the best thing to do is to just find companies that would do well in a recession and hold those stocks. No decay, potential for smaller gains in the meanwhile.

I‚Äôm just thinking about it. Everyone says we‚Äôre in an all time raging bull market. It‚Äôs great. Everyone‚Äôs making money.

I‚Äôm thinking of throwing a few grand into SQQQ and just leaving it there and forgetting about it.

Eventually the market has to crash, right? Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, maybe not this month or maybe not this year. But eventually.

Based on looking at how it performed in previous crashes it would definitely end up sitting lower than it is today if there is a serious crash.

I‚Äôd think it would probably result in some losses in the immediate future. But if I just put the money in and left it there, essentially considered it forgotten and never touched it...

Basically I would think of it as an insurance payment. If the market does crash and it effects my stocks then the losses would be balanced out by SQQQ gains.

In a minor crash like the COVID crash from March last year it would be like a 9 bagger. In the event of a major crash it would be a 100 bagger.

So if I put in for example 5k right now and just left it alone the worst case scenario would be that I lose some of the 5k. I could even buy it slowly and keep buying it to keep a good dollar cost average.

But then if there‚Äôs another minor crash like last year that 5k would become 45k. If there‚Äôs a major crash (complete devastation)that 5k would become 500k.

Thinking one step further, if it became obvious that the crash was over, I could flip whatever gains into TQQQ and then slowly ride the wave back up.

I haven‚Äôt made a decision yet but I‚Äôm having the overall feeling it would be a good idea.

However I‚Äôve only been investing for a few months so there‚Äôs also a chance that I‚Äôm wrong about this and potentially overlooking some factor. It seems like it‚Äôs almost too good of an idea.

I would like to know everyones thoughts on this, please."

2021-05-13 16:37:56,stocks,"Levered etfs suffer from beta slippage and have high expense ratios (almost 1%). As an example, if you invest $5000 in SQQQ and QQQ falls 10%, you would have $6500. But if the QQQ goes back up 10% the next day, you lose $1950 bringing you down to $4550. Basically, QQQ was flat over two days and you still lost money.

If the market trades flat, over time will lose money. If your plan is to hedge, just buy some puts. I think most brokers allow protective puts without needing approval since you would already own the shares."

They just take money from the cash part to buy stocks and then they build up their cash part afterwards. As a long term investor in a 100% stock based index fund portfolio I invest always immediately when I have enough cash collected to give up an order at reasonable costs. No matter where the share prices are or of if they climb up or fall. Time in the market beats timing the market.

2021-05-13 06:31:28,stocks,"I decided to use the last green day to do a bit of rebalancing to increase the cash position to about 10% (probably shoulda sold a tad more sooner but oh well). 

I am now being quite patient with that money. Between the earnings season farce and this multi-layer correction which likely isn't over, I am now more convinced than ever that many yolo into dips way too hard and soon. Nailing the bottom is darn near impossible so I've been realizing it's probably not a bad idea to have a bit of discipline and wait to get enough data to feel more comfortable about averaging down. Even if it means missing the absolute best prices. I spent 2 days trying to catch the falling with SHOP which I bought a touch too soon a few weeks ago and quickly stopped when I realized there was a good case to be made that this will probably get worse before it gets better.

Also, if the gunpowder in on my account runs out and things get REAL serious, I also can dip into my savings which i actively look to keep rather high at all times. Personally, I don't buy the 6 month rule and opt to save for 1 year's worth of overhead and potential expenses. Liquid cash may lose to inflation but it also won't get shredded by the market when it throws a fit. So I have that to fall on too if gets real bad. But all in all, I think waiting a bit is probably the manuveur."
2021-05-13 06:36:19,stocks,"its somethign I wonder myself. yet for every post stating ""I bought the dip"" , I bet there are probably hundreds of people not being able to do just that. 

there¬¥s also some ""financial experts"" that say being invested all the time is smarter than holding cash back for ""dips in the market"", simply because no one knows when dips will happen. 

selling at profits  is also proven historically to underperform simply staying put and holding. mostly because of tax reasons and again: no one knows when selling for a profit would have ended up in even more profit a day, a week or a month later. 

  
I bite myself in the foot whenever markets dip and I am out of cash. but I invest 1/3 of my salary every month. and I play around with a tiny fraction of my salary every month as well.   
although I do not budget this in my savings / investment category, but in my hobby / leisure category simply because I do degen stuff with it."

2021-05-13 09:42:47,stocks,"I think buying the dip and dollar cost averaging is two separate strategies. DCA as you are practicing it is blind purchasing which averages out the purchasing highs and lows. Buying the dip is aiming to purchase the lows and hoping that you were correct.  
My father in law is the buy the dip guy. The does DD on companies he is interested in, has the price he thinks is the low and set the limit buy on that price, and holds cash until that limit buy is triggered. I believe he updates the qty and the price once in a while to better reflect the changing circumstances and the increase in the cash available.  
You could also do a hybrid type of plan where you hold a certain percentage in cash to buy the dip and the rest of the amount gets blindly thrown in for the DCA. For example, if I plan on holding 30% in cash for the dip buying and I put $1000 into the account, I will spend 700 for DCA and hold 300 in the account for the dip buying later."

Instead I averaged down on my positions buying way too many dips until now and I'm still 64% cash. So, I still have plenty of buying power to go through other blood months (high growth) but I'm waiting the market to calm down this time.
I guess the trick is dca, never being 100% invested and keep some dry power available. Alternatively leave most of it in a world index etf which are less volatile.

DCA a budgeted portion of your paycheck and you won't have useless cash losing value in a savings or money market account.

Edit:  scenario right before CoVid hit.  Its Feb 2020 and the S&P is at 3375, an all time high.  You can hold cash or invest.  Today it‚Äôs at 4120, an all time high.  You can hold cash or invest.  It‚Äôs April 2030, S$P is at 5900, you can hold cash or invest.

2021-05-13 10:09:31,stocks,"A little use of margin never hurt. You must factor in possibilities like the market tanking -80% and getting margin called and how quickly you will respond. This tactic means you keep tabs on the extra size positions you may get on margin and having a smaller goal for how much the prices go up before you sell.


If you get a regular paycheck from which you can invest you could also have a smaller dip buying strategy, generally works better for value stocks, like -5% is buy time. Margin also lets you use your paycheck from a month in the future on a -10% dip today.


If you have a diversified portfolio it is also possible to sell some of the green positions and buy some of the red ones.

2021-05-13 17:24:24,stocks,"I started with a weird mantra which I later found out was something a bunch of people do so I'm not as clever as I thought :(

At the end of the month, after my bills and savings are taken care of, everything else is dumped into my brokerage. I round up the fractional shares each of my ""long term, never touch"" ETFs and let the rest of the cash sit until I find something interesting to dick around with. Sometimes I don't, so if it's unused I put it into my ETFs.

Anyway, I keep a core group of funds for the majority of my money (VTI, VXUS, BND, BNDX) in one account, outside of that I do my swing-trades and yearly profit gambles on individual stocks in a separate account.

On the first of the month, whatever is left in SPAXX goes into the Vanguard funds. Then I transfer from my bank into my SPAXX leftover cash funds, and then I round up my ETFs. 

Throughout the month I pick up 10 shares of something here, 10 shares of something there. Whatever looks interesting to hold for a year or two. Buying the dips on stocks I already have.

THEN, on the first of the month, whatever is left in SPAXX goes into ETFs, etc etc.

Twice a year I ""rebalance"", I sell the shares I no longer want to keep. I tuck away enough for the tax man. The leftover profits go into ETFs, the original amount I spent goes back into SPAXX for more degenerate gambling.

It's taken a while to get the machine going and sometimes I'll have a month or two break due to real life expenses or emergencies, but I think the core tenet is to spend last month's money on this month's investing, rather than spending this month's money on this month's investing.. if that makes sense."

2021-05-13 08:08:26,stocks,"I've been holding on to NVDA for the past 3 years so I've seen the times where I went pretty down on it. I held on and it has worked for me so no regrets on that.

TSMC has been down, and I bought it on the higher side. But I think with respect to budget I should put more into it down the line. I bought it during the earlier dip.

I feel like with my friends, we engage in heavy tech talk and the expansion and dependence of Semiconductors. Which is why I tend to gravitate towards tech stocks that's been working in my favor since I started my portfolio.

Basically, I go long. I'm budgeting myself based on my student loans, cost of living, and when I see to it that I have an extra grand here and there, that's when I plan ahead. 

And the returns have exceeded my loan interest so I think I'm in the right direction."

2021-05-13 08:15:36,stocks,"A couple things. People hold cash. I know, it‚Äôs anathema to many, but keeping cash on hand isn‚Äôt as bad as some people think.

Second, buying the dips is a good strategy, but don‚Äôt massively overweight a particular investment because it‚Äôs on sale. Leave some room in your position for future buying oppontinuties. That is, if you can justify 5% of your portfolio to one stock, then leave a point or two of space to average into. Leave some breathing room for dips so you don‚Äôt chase sale prices and end up 25% in one stock.

I‚Äôve read some threads where the OP is trying to figure out what to sell because everything is dropping, they are overweight in loser stocks and want to buy new stocks that are on sale. I read this and immediately understand that this investor had poor or no planning of their purchases."
2021-05-13 08:18:58,stocks,Maybe You're not taking profits at the top if you can't buy the dip. Maybe also investing more than you can afford to lose. It's hard to call the top or the dip either way.

I try to keep 12 mo living expenses on hand in cash.  This gives me between 6-12 mo cash to invest during dips.  Pace myself and never go all in on any dip.  Once I‚Äôm down to only 6 mo reserve, got to stop buying and wait to save up again.  Almost at that point now.  Can also sell other stocks to raise cash but might have to pay taxes on those sales if taking gains, so plan ahead."

And buying the dip is valid in case you have investments other than stocks (ex bonds).

As you can imagine, eventually when people accumulate a good amount of investment, it's natural to not leave 100% in stocks.

The more cash invested we accumulate (and the older we get), the more conservative people in general tend to be. Meaning, we start to allocate more towards bonds and stuff like that.

Cash is no different than $APPL or $THE or $OLN it is just a position. Its return is from liquidity, nimbleness and flexibility.

So my take away/strategy: 

Lump sum during the bull market obviously (buy stock right away eliminating my cash). Have exit points for % of my stock shares during the bull run that are time dependent from the last nadir of the correction. In addition, having a % portfolio in cash allocation target that is similarly time dependent from the last correction. 

During the correction or bear market, I now have cash to ‚Äúbuy the dip‚Äù. However, it is super important to be patient and disciplined. You don‚Äôt know how big or how long of a correction it will be. This is when I do increment purchases that are dependent on the duration of the correction, but also on the % correction.

New: Auto deposit money but don't invest until there is a dip or buying opportunity. (Or ignore dips altogether on safer picks and just accept you'll buy during peaks knowing it'll recover) If you have FOMO, auto deposit into an index fund then take from that when you want to invest in a specific stock.

Intermediate (Couple years): Taking profits, not selling out, but sell some and reinvest when there is opportunity.

Rebalance (5+ years): When there is a buying opportunity, valuate your positions and readjust.   (Also, by this time you're taking regular profits). You might like multiple stocks but want more of a stock that is oversold. So you convert one stock to another outright.

At some point your deposits of 500 or perhaps 1k start to look measly in the face of selling some 300 stocks to move 10k into another opportunity. But keep that auto deposit going till you have two comma's. (Periods for you weirdos)

P.S. Not exactly a strategy but when you invest in companies that give you dividends that also gives you cash on hand for buying opportunities."

It's interesting to hear people talk about ""don't try to time the market"". One of the biggest preachers of this was Warren Buffett. However, if you actually look at what he does, it's opposite of his advice. Buffett buys the dips. He spends big when some of his favorite stocks drop. He would be a fool not to.

I don't believe in some magical way to time buying. I just know that the simplest advice, ""buy low and sell high"" is the only way to make money.

I keep some cash back so I can buy some specific stocks when they hit lows. So far, every year for the past 12 years there's been really good dips to pick up solid companies at bargain prices.

I might get a lot of hat on this but my portfolio is doing just fine through this dip, and I had no problem with the pandemic dip. Plus I have cash to buy up the shares you all sell off in a panic."

Having a zero cash balance in whatever broker you're using isn't that great unless you can just fund it from some other account instantly.  Obviously less relevant if you're not that interested in buying the dips and getting out and all you're doing is long term investing, you're probably way better off just buying whenever you have the cash at your regular intervals with whatever you feel is a good value at the time. 

But I will say having 10-30k in a cash balance in an account is how you can sometimes capitalize on stupid shit like Gamestop and AMC and not run the risk of financial ruin when you miss the peak or whatever.  I think a lot of people do that on margin and that's a really dumb play for a lot.  Works for some, there might still be a pile of people out there on margin for GME at $300+ too though and they'll all wish that they'd paid cash for things at some point if not already."

For me, I'm not trying to time the market on the macro-level, but I am on the micro-level.

I'm not really trying to hit many peaks and dips, but I am sort of am on a small scale when I am changing a portion of my portfolio.

I invest on an overflow strategy.  I like to have a set amount of cash on hand at all times, but I also like to invest in at least 5-10k lots.  


As I always well underspend my paycheck, this amount naturally overflows past my reserve point and when I'm somewhere in the 5-10k range of invest, I sort out which stock/etf/bond I want to purchase and buy it.

In small market corrections typically bond prices go up to be in safe investments and stock prices go down. To keep the stock and bond allocation consistent portfolio managers will sell bonds to buy more stock. In extreme market corrections like March 2020,  nearly all bond, stock, and other asset investments went down in value. The only bonds to go up in value were US Treasury bonds because the federal reserve was buying them to provide liquidity to banks and the market. Eventually the Federal Reserve announced other bonds that qualified for purchase and drove up the price on those bonds."

This should only be done if you actually plan on riding it out and you think that the stock will increase a bit more.

Having said that, I tend to view waiting to buy dips for the sake of 'buying the dip' just the junior version of waiting for a market crash. You might as well just spend more time in the market, unless you have good reason to keep cash on the sidelines that the market as a whole doesn't know about/agree with.

I have a pretty diverse portfolio with about 50 positions. On any given day some will go up, some will go down. I have some confidence in everything I hold, so I buy whatever is down on payday.

Look, you can't time the market.

But when you see your investment achieve above-market highs, you have to take some profit.

You can also call it portfolio rebalancing if you want to sound professional.

But if you don't milk your cash cows, you won't have much cash.

Cash should normally be 10-20% of your holdings. More when stocks have been plateauing high and you are rebalancing towards cash, lower when stocks just landed in a fire sale and you just grabbed everything you could.

A 1 month low is not a dip, it's just a blip.

A 1 year low is a dip.

A 5 year low is a fire sale."

This is timing the market by definition, which you correcly state, you can't.

2021-05-13 13:55:26,stocks,"Do note that the cash will be just sitting there not doing anything until the dip, so there is opportunity cost related to that strategy. Also you are banking on being right on the dip, but your entry point might not be the bottom of the dip and you'll just take the red all the way down for that ""dip"" purchase. So even dip purchase should be done in a sort of a DCA pattern to average out the bottom price.  
Personally, I think DCA plan you have currently is better plan than the hybrid plan(or pure dip purchase plan) because of the opportunity cost and likely hood of missing the true bottom price. I would probably try paper trading with the dip purchase strategy and only adapt the hybrid plan if the dip strategy works out for you on the paper trading."

So one month I just put all the money into the account and I skipped buying like normal. I waited and picked up what I could, when I felt an opportunity to, as it happened in real time. Then at the end of the month I still had some funds, so I split it four ways into my ETFs, and then rounded each one up when I got paid on the first.

Now it's cyclical and I always have a bit of cash on hand. The hardest part is seeing ""unused funds just sitting there"" when I remind myself it's my opportunity money. Instead of buying NOW and then going red, I wait for the red and buy when it starts moving green again. I feel like I'm minimizing potential losses, and maximizing potential gains, and instead of just dumping it all into stocks on the 1st and waiting like some kind of passenger on a bus, I feel more in control.

2021-05-13 07:54:42,stocks,I use trading212 as well and if you're getting instant transfers that means you're using a credit/debit card for deposits. You are charged a fee for that. For free deposits you have to use bank transfer which can take up to 3 business days.

2021-05-13 08:41:16,stocks,This is timing the market; you're deciding when it's a good time to invest your money by predicting what will happen.
2021-05-13 08:37:04,stocks,Yeah! This is something i'm considering but i hace never use margin besote..but that option seems like a viable solution for me
2021-05-13 09:33:32,stocks,"Yeah I get what you're saying. I just meant value in equities should probably take into consideration macroeconomics.

I'm sure others here have a way better understanding of this and can explain it far better than me but as an example, lower interest rates keep present value of future cash flows higher. So a company's discounted cash flow is more likely to be higher than the current cost meaning an investment is more likely to give a higher ROI, *relatively speaking.

Maybe in simpler terms, you value a company, look at its ratios, ROIC, see it has a decent moat, etc. but don't invest since when you see its earnings, you believe treasuries or even money in the bank gives you better returns when factoring in risk. But if cash is less valuable because of lower interest rates or the fact the Fed is pumping trillions of it into the economy, you're more inclined to accept a higher P/E ratio since investing in the company is now more likely to give you better returns (factoring higher risk).

Not financial advice though, more so that smart people can correct me where I have gone astray.

Edit: Sorry, also not sure about using Apple as a basis for the market... What do you mean by ""highest market cap relative to P/E""?"
2021-05-13 04:12:20,stocks,"Yeah, taxes work differently here. I can buy and sell as much as I want. I pay a flat wealth tax on my wealth instead of on individual gains or losses.

2021-05-13 04:20:40,stocks,"> NOT selling is also timing the market.

Not really. When holding I historically expect an average return per year and don't care about what happens inbetween. The strategy also reinvests regardless of market climate or stock prices in predefined time intervals.

2021-05-13 10:35:38,stocks,So in your opinion having a balanced portfolio of x percent of stocks and cash and rebalance when they are out of sync is timing the market?.
2021-05-13 14:14:01,stocks,"If you think taking profit and rebalancing a portfolio is timing the market... well it's not my responsibility to set you straight.

Succes on the market means buying low and selling high. That is the only law that ultimately matters.

2021-05-13 08:24:59,stocks,Need a margin account to be able to trade funds instantly.
2021-05-13 11:32:49,stocks,Yeah I use Fidelity and don‚Äôt have waiting issues on ACH transfers. Seems like their account is only set up on one side. If your bank and the exchange know the ACH it should be fairly quick.
2021-05-13 19:27:03,stocks,Nope cash account. I don‚Äôt understand Margin/options trading enough to touch it.
2021-05-13 09:00:13,stocks,No this is how it works for cash accounts at fidelity.
2021-05-13 08:44:28,stocks,"No, it isn't margin trading.  It's margin-ish if you want to quibble, but fact is you don't need to wait days for transfers to clear unless you have other issues."
2021-05-13 16:16:04,stocks,Ah I think fidelity does require you to also wait on stocks below $3 if I remembering right.
2021-05-13 08:36:35,stocks,Even Robinhood makes you wait for sales to settle. I had to wait almost a week to withdraw my cash when I closed my account out.

2021-05-13 10:49:39,stocks,Usually you pick fixed dates to rebalance regardless of market conditions. So you don't time the market.
2021-05-13 15:32:19,stocks,"Rebalancing and taking profits aren't timing the market.

Taking profits thinking you'll find cheaper entry points is timing the market. Doing so, essentially you think you are smarter than the market, which you are not."
2021-05-13 10:09:54,stocks,"Yeah I get what you're saying, but selling can give you losses to reduce your taxable profit in the financial year, which means same profit but less taxes. Less taxes means more capital to re-invest in the next year. Investment management firms also do this. (e.g. https://www.thinkadvisor.com/2021/03/25/sell-the-dip-why-you-should-harvest-tax-losses-year-round/?amp=1)

Depending on your country's tax laws, it may even be possible to maintain the same exposure while counting the tax loss (eg. buy SPY after selling VOO - again not sure if this is necessarily a valid strat everywhere).

In these situations, selling will either end up saving you money (if you have profits greater or equal to the loss) or have no real effect on how much tax you end up paying. Of course, depending on the country, people need to take into consideration wash sales and asset holding periods which can affect tax rates in some places. Not financial advise tho"
2021-05-13 08:34:47,stocks,"This is correct, it's just warning that you are using unsettled cash and if you close the position before that cash settles you will get hit with a good faith violation."

2021-05-13 08:42:13,stocks,"No you don't, at least not on Fidelity."
2021-05-13 16:57:33,stocks,You are correct. They consider $3 the threshold to label them a penny stock.
2021-05-13 08:41:24,stocks,I‚Äôve never sold $800 of stock and then had to wait 2-3 days for that cash to appear in my account on Robinhood.
2021-05-13 10:55:46,stocks,"You are just looking at this one tax period. I don't know how to explain it to you.

Let's make an example:

you invest 1000 bucks, and tax is 10% on winnings

You invest it diversified into two chunks of 500, and want to take profit when it hits 600. 




let's say after year one, you have 500 that went up to 600, and the other 500 that went down to 400, all paper losses. you have 1000 invested

#OPTION 1
If you want to take out the 600, without paying the 10 in tax, you have to take out the 400 too, and then you have 600 cash on hand, and 400 invested. 

in another years time, you still have 600 in cash on hand and the initial 400 bounced back and then some up to 600. now you have to pay 20 in tax. 

you end up with 1200 in total and have to pay 20 in tax.

#OPTION 2
you take out the 600 in year one, keep it as cash on hand, pay your 10 in tax and let the 500 with 100 paperloss ride.

in the next year, just like in the other example, it goes back to 600, and you end up with 500 and a 600 paperwin.

you cash out, and have to pay 10 in tax.


you end up with 1200 in total and had & have to pay total of 20 in tax.

BUT: in option 1 you do four trades, in options 2 you do two trades. in option 1 you pay 20 bucks in year two, and in options 2 you pay 10 and 10. 

So if, and only if inflation on the difference of the deferred tax bill to the initial tax bill is bigger than your trading cost, then you will show a profit.

In practice, it's usually not the case (this year ironically for my argument, it might be)."
2021-05-13 11:17:22,stocks,"Me too! But I had that same feeling seeing those warnings. Don‚Äôt hesitate to call customer service either they‚Äôre really helpful! I wanted to make sure I wasn‚Äôt trading on margin myself because I‚Äôve read horror stories lol

Someone else said it but I‚Äôll say it too. Be sure those funds will clear. I make small amounts that I know will clear but moving big chunks you may wanna ask about wire transfers instead of bank deposits. Their customer service can help a ton"
2021-05-13 10:34:08,stocks,"Just be absolutely sure those funds will clear into Fidelity. I initiated a transfer back in Jan that didn‚Äôt clear. I traded on the unsettled amount and when the stock didn‚Äôt perform well, all of my positions were washed. It was a really tough morning. So yeah, when you trade on unsettled funds, just be sure those funds are going to reach that Fidelity account unhindered."

2021-05-13 00:00:00,stocks,"Mat Ishbia called out in Feb Q4 earnings that he wanted to payback shareholders. May Q1 he delivered on the regular div and buyback. I have shared my thoughts on UWMC in past. The company announced Q1 earnings and while they look like they are below expectations it was explained by the CEO that because of the speed of their execution, their results are reflective of the higher rate environment already while competitors are lagged.

During   the Q4 2020 earnings call he  had mused about options that would be on   the stable, special dividend,  buyback or raising the dividend.

Feb Q4 Earnings Quote:

The    Board did approve a dividend, a $0.10 quarterly dividend to be  paid   on  April 6 for all shareholders of record as of March 10. **We expect  this to be a regular quarterly dividend**.

And    so you guys know how we're thinking about this. Our balance sheet  is  a   fortress. And our current liquidity position is very strong, and   we   have access to the capital markets as well. The way we think about   this   going forward is we're producing a lot of cash. We're going to   maybe   be more profitable than some expected and be very successful in   2021.   And **if we have excess cash that I and the Board deem is too much,  we will be delivering that back**. And whether we have to **change    the  dividend in the future, as in raise it or a special dividend,    those  things are definitely on the table or even buying back shares**.

May Q1 Earnings Quote:

As    you saw in our release, the Board approved our quarterly dividend of     $0.10 to consistently deliver money back to our shareholders for a     record date on June 10 and payable July 6. The Board and I always  **explored increasing the dividend actually or looking at a special  dividend or a share buyback program**. As you guys have seen, we **concluded     share buyback was the best use of our capital to reward  shareholders.    We announced the authorization of $300 million share  buyback over the    next 24 months**.  And **quite honestly, with where the share price is, it's a great opportunity for us to continue to buy that**.

Then in answering a question from an analyst

Doug   Harter -  Great. And then just in terms of capital return, you   mentioned sort of  the float. I  guess just how are you thinking about   kind of **how much of  the float  you'd be willing to take out and pacing around share  repurchase**?

Mat Ishbia -  Yes, Doug. So I'm learning these rules as we go **because at this stock  price, I'm a buyer, right**?   And so we'll buy shares as soon as tomorrow, I  think, as our legal   teams say we're allowed to do. And so I don't know  how many I can buy   and what I can do, but I'm very conscientious of the  float.  If the   float was not a concern, **we'd be more aggressive**. However,  **we    have authorization from the Board to buy up to $300 million, and I'm     going to take advantage of that opportunity while being conscientious     of our partners in the float.**

TL/DR:    UWMC and their board have been looking at ways to give back to    shareholders. Instead of a short term cash out, they decided on a    buyback that they are planning to exercise immediately on so that they    can retire shares while the SP is low. They will NOT buy so much that  it   will ruin their float % for Russell. The CEO is aggressive, has    approval to spend $300 and he's going to take FULL advantage. At current    stock price levels the CEO has stated he is a BUYER! They are not   waiting, it's being deployed now.

If your goals are short term, consider locking in profits. Retail money is getting scared and institutional money is HEAVILY shorting. People are concerned about rising interest rates and new tax laws.

I don't personally have any short term positions at all right now and I don't intend to day or swing trade in these conditions. I will however be scooping up long term investments if this trend continues."

Advantage of LEAP is more leverage, i.e. low investment for synthetic 100 share position. For example, SQ is trading at 209, buying 100 shares would mean investment of 20,900. The LEAP is got was around 4000. 

However, this is much more risker strategy  than holding the stock. In a bear market  my options could go to 0.

ITM= in the money, strike is below current share price
ATM = at the money, strike is current share price

Leaps are just call that expire in 6+ months some say 3+, weeklies are one to two weeks, calls are longer than weeklies but shorter than leaps

Yes of course there is delusional behaviour, every stock's 'followers' has this. GME is just a lot bigger due to media attention following the gamma/short squeeze in January, bringing in a lot of newcomers.

Not everyone sells covered calls (or ""poor mans covered calls"" in this case) with LEAPS, but it's a really nice advantage of buying and holding LEAPS.  I'm pretty conservative with selling CC's, but I've been selling weeklies on AMD and collecting around $25/week just off of that."

With all the stocks in the world, how do you focus on what to look out for to build your portfolio? Do you stick to one thing at a time ex: tech, environmental, pharma?

2021-05-12 22:41:04,stocks,"For me I focus on tech, quite likely because I've been in IT for a couple decades... that history makes it a bit easier to keep the pulse on trends, so I'm more comfortable with investments in that direction.  

That being said, all the past/present field knowledge in the world can't tell you the future.  It just helps you occasionally guess a bit better.

If I had to guess right now, I'm still very optimistic on how the top tech stocks will perform for the remainder of '21.  GOOG is an example of one that I'm very bullish on.  The reopening requires a tech 'infrastructure' and GOOG is positioned as one of the best for advertising & travel.  Not to mention the great numbers it holds as a company.

2021-05-13 00:00:00,stocks,"so since there's a chip shortage going on is now the time to buy stock in the auto industry? As i'm sure you've heard their is a shortage of chip/ semiconductors. These chips power our electronics, many of which are now being used in vehicles. In short, some of the auto industry plants are shutting down bc there aren't enough chips to continue building the cars. so, in my line of thinking some of the auto industry stocks' are going to fall bc they are losing money. This is also making the price of cars soar and people on a budget will probably just wait it out to buy since this is supposed to be over by 2022. So the auto industry is losing money in more than one way. For instance, Honda is already undervalued but if this chip shortage continues the stock could fall further and become very undervalued.  Thoughts?

side note: Glad I bought a new car last year"

I think Biden is working on plans for America to start making its own semiconductors, I feel like it would be a good time to invest in some chip manufacturers and companies that need those chips now and see a positive rise/return in the next few years as we recover from the pending storm and build on that manufacture infrastructure."

2021-05-12 22:29:46,stocks,"I work in the automotive industry so I hope I can help you out a bit. 

First off, you're a bit late to the party to be honest. 
 
It depends purely on where you want to look. Every car manufacturer is getting fucked by the shortage, but some are doing just fine while others are extremly struggling. Volkswagen as an example is doing just fine, there are a few days here and there where the Main car Plant in Wolfsburg isn't working because there's no chips, but it's not often enough. Obviously they're losing money like everyone else, but they're doing fine. 
 
Ford is not getting by so good by the shortage. I think they produce like 40-50% less cars or so because of the shortage? I'm not sure about the exact numbers, but it's somewhere around that range.  
 
But I'll be honest with you, going for a chip Shortage play is way too late now and the only way you can use it if it goes up the day the shortage ends, but I don't think it's gonna matter too much. I'd go for Ford, but that's a huge gamble honestly. Don't know about Honda personally. Volkswagen already is doing pretty good in their stock price, so I'm not sure if one should buy one with the intend of getting a gain when the chip shortage is over (even though I think Volkswagen is a great investment anyways)"
2021-05-12 23:42:06,stocks,"Why would a chip shortage entice you to buy auto stocks? Do you mean if / when it dips? If so possibly ya. 

I'm personally not that enticed by auto stocks. Automotive companies are huge in terms of market cap so it takes more capital to move their stocks. EVs are hype but I'm not quite sure how much that will amplify their sales. There's also the tesla factor and whether you think they will absord the entire EV industry. Go watch a video of the new Ford Mach E or something and compare it to a tesla. If interest rates are pumped due to inflation fears we will also see their sales dip."

Autolus Therapeutics plc (AUTL)By: Dulan Lokuwithana, SA News Editor3 Comments
Autolus Therapeutics (AUTL +33.3%) has surged today in reaction to impressive results from a Phase 1 trial for its CD19 CAR T cell therapy AUTO1 in relapsed / refractory (r/r) indolent B cell lymphomas (IBCL).
The data is included in an abstract presentation to be unveiled at the European Hematology Association (EHA) scheduled June 9 - 17, 2021.
At data cutoff on February 18, ten r/r IBCL patients had received AUTO1, and nine were available for evaluation.
As per early data, the patients have achieved 100% complete remission rates and excellent CAR engraftment and expansion, the company said.
Eight out of nine patients are in ongoing remission with a median of 3.1 months (range 1-5.6m), and one patient in complete remission has died due to COVID-19."

I got stopped out of my speculative plays during the first two months of the year then moved to more conservative stocks and ETFs.  I am pretty confident in my current positions.  Some positions will go red.  Maybe they all will.  But over the long run quality wins out.  I have cash to buy if I find something selling for a large discount.

I think there is a pretty good chance we will see a market slump that lasts into summer.  People will likely freak out about inflation.  The experts can explain inflation is transient, brought on by supply chain problems, labor shortages from people unwilling to work, whatever, but people will believe their own anecdotal experiences combined with an unease with the consequences of politicians giving out free money to anyone with a pulse.  I just got off the phone with my parents.  They just returned from a grocery run to ""stock up before prices increase.""   It looks like toilet paper hoarding all over again, and this will cause further prices increases that are already being driven by supply shortages.  That sort of pessimism is not good for the market.

On the plus side there is a really good chance we will see some great buying opportunities.  Buy the dip does not mean buy when the market goes down 2% for the day; it means buy when the stock significantly declines, usually over a course of weeks or months.  Some of the growth stocks that were trading at obscene valuations may become attractive.

Unless you're a very passive investor in ETFs or mutual funds, look at your portfolio regularly, probably even more so when it's tanking, and learn from it and look for good buying opportunities.  If you only play when the market's hot, you're much more likely to buy high and go in the red for quite some time.  If you take some of the emotion out of it and stay on top of things through the good and the bad, you can buy promising stocks when they are priced the best."

Apart from NVAX, I'm hurting with Palantir (but as a long term investor this will eventually rebound), semiconductors, real estate, oil, and also fukin Chewy (again, this is a long term play that will eventually increase massively).  


Not looking at my portfolio is the only thing that keeps me sane in those two last weeks. But why would I care about it now? Do I need cash? No!

2021-05-13 00:00:00,stocks,"Tesla has a change in payment methods Elon has just stated they will no longer allow a certain coin for payment.

https://mobile.twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1392602041025843203?s=21

This is a big change due to Elon's influence in that sector and TSLA's profitability with that coin. 

I am wondering if going forward we will see it completely gone for their balance sheet. 

In my opinion, it is hard to tell whether or not he was forced to say that, as the board has had past issues with Elon in the past. Either way, going forward this might change the public perception of Elon or Tesla, which will mostly likely have direct effect on the share price. 

I wanted to add I have no position in TSLA and wanted to provide an update. 

I thought this was especially interesting because that sector used Elon as excuse for a catalyst when TSLA invested into that coin. This obviously helped his public image as well. 

The fact that he also stated he's looking at other currencies is letting another crowd to think there may be a chance. I don't think the board would let him accept payment in that currency.

What do you think all will happen going forward?"

2021-05-13 08:18:10,stocks,"Using a crypto currency for a ""growth"" business is just not a reality. 

He needs to sell the crypto once he gets it and often times it goes down. If he has 10% profit margin and sells the crypto on a day its worth 4% less he will lose that from his profit. Maybe it will go up and he will gain that too, but hes paying taxes on the increase.

Businesses that are trying to grow need cash flow and predictable cash flow so they can finance their growth appropriately. The constantly variations in crypto price make it hard to finance their next big manufacturing facility. If they aren't selling it the moment they get the btc in hand they run the risk of accumulating a large btc position only for it to lose 10% of its value when they wanna sell it. Hell their sale could even disturb the market.

Yeah sure he can keep the crypto on hand, but thats not what a growing company does. With growth companies, profit is reinvested into assets to grow their sales, whether its hiring more workers, a new product etc. If he just holds the btc he misses the opportunity to invest into tesla's next gadget"

Everything is tied to that coin. That coin goes down, it'll take that market with it.

It just feels like an odd generational thing, where there are new wave of investors thinking crypto is invincible, but there are the older people who have already gone through 2 crashes.

Environmental factors aside, as mining lithium mining is pretty devastating as well. IMO, it's a pretty bad investment for a company that barely makes any revenue without subsidies or specific volume in orders.

It made sense for banks to hedge against inflation, but even that is very speculative for an asset that has no regulatory body."

I honestly thought prior to this TSLA is going to head into a lawsuit over FSD, but here we are.

  
This further exemplifies that markets need some form of regulation to protect investors. No man should have that power to move a market that much off of one tweet.

2021-05-13 09:57:34,stocks,"Nice strawman arguments. I‚Äôm not arguing he‚Äôs a hypocrite for burning rocket fuel.

My point is, how can he attack bitcoin citing environmental concerns when he launched a company to drill for fossil fuels. That company was created to be run as an oil and gas company. That‚Äôs why the separate entity was created. It‚Äôs not a ‚Äúdrill for our methane and that‚Äôs it.‚Äù If it was, it would be a capital expense for SpaceX. 

The land his company leased is NOT a natural gas play. It‚Äôs an oil and gas play. There is oil, there are NGLs. It‚Äôs notoriously weak in methane. So, his company will be selling that excess because they don‚Äôt need it. That‚Äôs why the company was created. Thus, he is contributing to the production because he refuses to support the oil and gas industry by buying their excess natural gas. It‚Äôs all hypocritical posturing. Natural gas prices in Texas frequently go negative. It would be far cheaper for Elon to transport that natural gas from other producers. Especially since the land he leased is a poor shale. He‚Äôs going to spend a lot to drill (ps rigs don‚Äôt run on clean energy) for minimal production. The last operator there went bankrupt for this very reason. But this is all about Elon‚Äôs ego and refusal to support the oil and gas industry in any way. So he‚Äôs fine contributing to production just to make a point.

As for bitcoin, it‚Äôs estimated it produces 22m tonnes a year. Iron and steel; 3600m tonnes. Non ferrous metals; 350m tonnes. Chemicals; 1,100m tonnes. Just a few of his companies inputs. But those are okay because he needs them. Drilling is okay because something.

TSLA's initial buy was a signal of adoption, just like banks buying in. But I am sure you already know the phases to crypto adoption, so you should know how critical this is. 

In addition, that specific coin is supposed to be deflationary and a store of value. It should have absolutely ripped on all the news this week. To me that is a sign that people do not actually view it in the way they say they do, or they are overleveraged and it is indeed in a bubble. Even within the crypto community, most agree that we will hit winter again sometime soon. Personally, I believe it is when the Fed eases on QE relatively soon.

Either way, no one is debating that some crypto has some use. The issue is that most people do not care about that and are using it for its votality so it's being used as a ponzi scheme. It doesn't help when crypto is owned by a small majority of whales in each coin. This year people are really questioning banks and the fed, but at the same time, some regulation is great and needed for retail protection. That isn't happening in this sector. That's why we have so many scam coins and people will get burned, and then never invest in that sector again

Edit: wanted to add, I've posted this before. People get so touchy about their investments. I've been in pump and dump stocks before, and when I've been told they are a pump and dump, I'm not like nah, youre too stupid to understand. I honestly research and try to figure out if I'm maybe in a bubbled asset. Stop treating your investments like your politics. Have the ability to call things for what they are in their current state.

Also, guy, did you even read my post? I asked if you think later on TSLA would unload its coin. Thought it was pretty obvious. If I say I'm against blood diamonds, but then keep 1.4b of them, it sounds a bit hypocritical. Don't you think?"

2021-05-12 23:49:46,stocks,"We're now 20 years out from the dot com bubble and crypto has done this boom bust cycle at least 3-4 times. add in the 50k price point for what seems to be a lot of institutional money and it's definitely a solid reason as to why it won't take a total nosedive.   


People in crypto, especially whales, tend to be pretty aware of patterns/behavior which then causes said behavior to start changing; A lot of people have talked about the 50k price point for institutions, that influences when people buy and how they hold.  


The market is def headed towards a correction, a lot of alt coins are gonna die off, but idk how much it's gonna drop overall or if it's really gonna be the end of this cycle"

2021-05-13 02:19:04,stocks,"You don't actually own the stock, just a license to it in the US. So it's pretty imaginary unless you physically own the stock certificate in your hand.  (A lot of how the US works is like this)


It doesn't need to store value if it has inherent value. So things like eth tokens(ex crypto kitties or any defi)need eth to be spent. So eth derives it's value from that and all the dapps on it. (Check out decentraland for what's essentially second life on eth blockchain)

This does not apply to btc, that gets it value from eventual scarcity regardless of how much it's worth in USD people like owning shit there's a limited amount of. It's literally a digital version of gold. 


And medium of exchange? Nah btc is pure store of value at this point until there's an upgrade fixing transaction speeds and fees. 

Other cryptos will wind up being used for general payments. Some banks already use ripplenet which just turns whatever money their sending into ripple and then converts it back to fiat when it's deposited automatically.

But outside of that, there's bitpay and spedn which turns crypto to cash on a card. Then places like overstock accept it. Coinbase is/has it's own visa card.

There are decentralized exchanges that can be utilized to pay people in any crypto they accept with one you own."
2021-05-13 11:13:49,stocks,"> stocks are a claim of ownership on an asset that produces cash flows
 
Imagine if you had to own Facebook stock to use Facebook. Or you had to own Nvidia stock use Nvidia graphics cards.

You cannot use any services in the crypto world without owning the coins / tokens. You want to use the Ethereum network? You need to own Ethereum. You want to use the Stellar network? You need to own XLM. You want to use the Cardano network? You need to own ADA. As long as the networks are in use (and they get exponentially larger every year), then the tokens will have value, and continue to go up in value as the network grows. (with the added variables of speculation, regulation, and improvements to network efficiency.)

These are tokens that power the networks. Comparing this shit to stocks is absurd."

2021-05-13 08:39:18,stocks,Elon just doesn't care about trading bitcoins. Teslas problem is that they had 20B in cash and they needed something else to hold long term because interest is so low. They only bought bitcoin for like 1B and instantly selling that bitcoin and lying about it doesn't really make any sense.

2021-05-13 00:00:00,stocks,"Rigel Pharmaceuticals Rigel Pharmaceuticals is a relatively small biopharmaceutical company that has had many positive developments in the last year; everything from stumbling upon the key to stopping the hyper-inflammatory Covid-19 disease state in its tracks, to recently having one of its drugs validated as a strong potential cancer therapeutic, to entering into a substantial co-development deal with one of the largest pharma's in the world Eli Lilly. Rigel has 3 drug programs it's actively working on including Fostamatinib, IRAK1/4 and RIP1 that are all in various stages of development. Below I'll be addressing these programs, some financial data, and price targets.

**Fostamatinib in ITP and WAIHA:**

Fost has been FDA/EMA/Canada approved for the treatment of ITP; an auto immune disorder that destroys blood platelets. Net sales in 2020 were $61m and RIGL expects those sales to grow in 2021. Israel approval expected Q2 or Q3 of 2021. Japan ph3 also just completed enrollment so approval is potentially on the horizon there as well.

Fost is in a late stage 3 study for WAIHA; an auto-immune disorder that destroys red blood cells. Expected enrollment completion late Q3 2021. There are no other approved treatments for this disease and RIGL had strong ph2 results. It is orphan designated which will also amount to a quicker review by the FDA.

**Fostamatinib for Covid:**

Fost was found by the University of Amsterdam to prevent Covid-19 cytokine storm by actively inhibiting spike proteins which are believed to lead to an over-active immune response that especially compromises the lungs. Further, it was found by Harvard and MIT to be the only FDA approved drug (in their 3700 drug database) to inhibit Mucin-1 which is elevated in Covid-19 as well as other non-Covid indications such as COPD, cystic fibrosis, and pneumonias. When this research was brought to RIGL they took it to the National Institute of Health and the Imperial College of London who found it compelling enough to begin two separate investigator sponsored trials (1 completed) in hospitalized Covid-19 patients. At the NIH as well they conducted a study by which a process called NETosis was occurring in these patients. Little is really known about NETosis or how it effects various covid and non-covid disease states but it's suspected of leading to and causing systemic thrombosis. (NETosis is when neutrophils are spliced and release their extra-cellular DNA into the blood serum which then binds to available proteins to form a fibrotic net-like structure to stop pathogens) At the NIH in their study when they applied neutrophils to non-covid and non-severe covid patient blood serum only a few neutrophils activated but when they applied neutrophils to severe-covid blood serum the entire dish turned green indicating something in that serum was activating every neutrophil. In a follow up study they then applied fostamatinib to this serum and entirely prevented the neutrophil destruction and DNA release from occurring. Additionally multiple other studies have also helped shed light on fostamatinib's role in preventing Covid platelet aggregation and thrombosis. Further the Department of Defense is paying for the lion's share of Rigel's phase 3 Covid study which may potentially lead to a substantial purchase by the DoD as indicated in the contract. See below.

NIH Phase 2 Results using Fostamatinib in ICU Covid-19 patients. 0 deaths, reduced ICU stay by 4 days (from 7 to 3), reduced adverse events by 50%, pulled fully ventilated patients off vent within 7 days, all biomarkers favored Fost over SoC. EUA being pursued.

**RIP1k program:**

Eli Lilly is co-developing RIGL's RIP1 program. RIGL received $125m upfront payment from Lilly this April, along w/ $835m in potential milestone payments, and royalties ranging from single digits to near 20% based on RIGL's involvement. Phase 2 studies expected to be launched this year. RIP1 is indicated in large CNS indications which Eli Lilly specializes that a relatively small pharma like RIGL can't undertake alone without substantial funding.

**IRAK1/4 program:**

RIGL has completed phase 1 studies and preparations are being made to begin phase 2 studies this year. Today RIGL saw a spike in price share due to data released by another company (Curis) where in a small cancer study of 9 patients all improved and at least 1 achieved complete remission status. It's expected the data readout will validate other IRAK inhibitors such as RIGL's IRAK1/4. Multiple other studies have found a number of indications in both Irak1 and Irak4 that RIGL may pursue.

**Outlicensed (partner-sponsored) trials**

Rigel has an extensive drug discovery program and has out-licensed a number of drugs that are currently in development. Rigel is entitled to substantial milestone payments and future stepped royalties (ranging from 5%-10% of net sales). RIGL often nets $20-40m annually from these agreements.

**Price Targets, institutional ownership and market cap**

H.C. Wainwright analyst Joseph Pantginis has a price target of $11.

Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Kristen Kluska price target of $7.

BMO Capital analyst Do Kim has a price target of $9.

Rigel is currently valued at \~$3.60 or about $600m.

Rigel has a high institutional ownership of 85%.

Familiarity will be huge, and then also logistically thinking about what would be started inpatient. In that case, fostamatinib probably isn‚Äôt on formulary and Rituximab (although expensive) would be started and then continued in clinic. 

For ITP, familiarity and just the plethora of other options we have. I do utilize fostamatinib as alternative mechanism to get responses. The data has just never been crazy better to usurp other therapies"
2021-05-13 00:00:00,stocks,"For those unaware: A loss in share value doesn't mean that someone else ""got your money."" It just simply ""disappears."" It may seem like a ""no brainer"" to most people but stocks don't work this way. A move 5% higher might have happened over 100,000 share volume and 4 weeks of time. The following move 5% lower can happen with 10,000 share volume over 2 days time. This would mean there are 90,000 shares out there with an ""unrealized loss"" that has ""disappeared"" from their owner's portfolio after purchasing in the last 4 weeks prior. 

It is a common perception that ""everyone selling"" is the issue when a stock goes down. Sometimes it is just the fact that there are no buyers. Sellers undercut each other to get to the limited bidders price that they are willing to offering.

It doesn't always take twice as many sellers to move the price down. Simply having half the buyers will do this on its own.

Additional sellers are not necessarily driving the market down right now there is just a lot of hesitation to buy."

2021-05-12 22:20:42,stocks,"If I do get margin called, I have a basket of stocks that's pretty stable.  I just cut bait with one of them."
2021-05-12 22:29:30,stocks,"It‚Äôs definitely a useful tool if used in a manner when the market is at a bottom.  I‚Äôve used margin from time to time but have always paid it off. I have my eye on a couple of stocks if they drop a bit more and hit a bottom.   
My guess is that a lot of people have been margins out since the market started dropping."
2021-05-12 22:45:23,stocks,"It is definitely a useful tool.  I'm very aggressive in how I invest.  Of course, I'm assuming a lot of risk, but I'm betting on the fact that 1.) The market won't likely to crash in the near future.  2.) We are at a start of an extended bull run.  



If I get margin called, I just have to rebalance my portfolio.  I can cut one of my 'defensive stocks'.  Not too big of a deal.  It is similar in concept to what Cathie Woods is doing with Apple in the past couple days."
2021-05-12 23:15:22,stocks,"So what would your high in price be with apple dropping to $123.  I guess it perhaps if it went to 118 I would probably buy a couple thousand shares to let it ride up to $130 again

2021-05-12 23:21:44,stocks,"Yes.  That is a tradeoff.  However, it is also true that stocks like apple and amazon has been trading sideways for half a year or longer.

As a result, on Friday, I went safe. I split my entire potfolio across ""safe"" long term S&P500 etf's, along with high dividend low volatility and FTSE ETF's also. I threw in a bit to things like Microsoft, Google and Berkshire aswell.

Because I did this on Friday, the market has taken a dump all week, so I'm sorry for that guys.

I know this is a long term play, and I shouldnt be worried about the market taking a dump 3 days into my investment, but for the long term outlook, how are you guys thinking about the next 3-12 months?

I know etf's should be held for years, but nobody can predict what will happen in 2028 so i'm just curious about people's feelings for the rest of this year. Is this just a blip or the start of a huge plummet?"

This is also the only way to not be worried about a crash. If you own a company at decent valuations you know that if the market crashes, these companies will be a ridiculous deal then and therefore will make their way back.

2021-05-13 00:00:00,stocks,"Tradingview clarification Hi everyone, apologies if this isn't the correct flair. I don't really know what to flair it as. 

The past few weeks i've noticed rather odd values and charts in my tradingview desktop and phone application. Settings were maintained, none changed.

1. Im either missing the shaded areas for after hours or premarket for various stocks, sometimes the same stocks everyday, sometimes it changes.
2. I was missing an entire day's worth of SPX last week. 
3. Afterhours/postmarket values don't match anyone else I've contacted that has tradingview. I've also referenced other chart/value websites and mine still differs. 

Here are examples from today:

The most notable one was today for Berkshire Hathaway Class A stock. 

[Berkshire Hathaway Class A missing shaded areas for afterhours and premarket. 1 minute chart. The share price is also quite different than every other source I've checked, including friends who have tradingview. Seems like im missing VIX and SPX days on that chart too.](https://imgur.com/SNjpOUX)

[Apple doesn't seem to have that problem today.](https://imgur.com/1d7QFNG)

[Amazon has a problem with today's afterhours and different price it seems?](https://imgur.com/E4y4gQK)

&#x200B;

Are any others experiencing similar issues? [Already restarted my laptop several times, loaded other chart templates and those show the same price for BRK.A](https://imgur.com/z8X2g2n)

[Amazon price is different though on the other chart.](https://imgur.com/rCCUsZ7)

Thank you for your time everyone."
2021-05-13 09:57:41,stocks,">Im either missing the shaded areas for after hours or premarket for various stocks, sometimes the same stocks everyday, sometimes it changes.

This happens pretty often, the data feed isn't great for pre/postmarket. Often won't show up until the next day or at all.

>I was missing an entire day's worth of SPX last week.

This is a lot more unusual, I've never seen that... I would report it to them for sure.

>Afterhours/postmarket values don't match anyone else I've contacted that has tradingview. I've also referenced other chart/value websites and mine still differs.

This is probably due to TradingView using CBOE for their data, it is very similar to the major exchanges but not the same (I think CBOE amalgamates trade information from a number of different places).

If you're paying for a plan, you can pay an additional $2 for the good realtime data for each exchange (the option is located on the account billing page), and this will probably resolve most of the data issues you're having."

2021-05-13 00:00:00,stocks,"How bad do we realistically expect this dip to continue? I have a lot of tech stocks (please no lectures on diversify. I know. But I can't diversify when my holdings are thousands in the hole).

Anyway, my biggest holding (dkng) has gone down virtually 10 straight trading days. 1 of those were green but by 13 cents so not much of a gain there.

The problem is, I've been using margin to average down because I honestly did not expect it to get this low. I'm now pushing margin limits and need some expert advice. What to cut.

My biggest bag holders in order are...

DKNG (-23% down, $54.89 CPS)
PLTR (-19% down, $23.11 CPS) 
SFT (-15% down, $9.16 CPS) 
PINS (-13% down, $65.95 CPS)

DKNG is 55% holding, PINS is 22%, PLTR 8%, SFT 5%

Needless to say, DKNG is the problem. I'm holding a lot and it's down the most. I used to believe in the stock, but now I don't know what do believe.

So my question is...

Do I just cut the cord and drop dkng before it drops to $20-25. Do I cut PINS? I can get rid of PLTR AND SFT but that won't help my margin deficit much.

Or do I continue what I've been doing and shaving 10 shares at a time off either dkng or pins when margin gets close to max and just hope this crash stops soon?

Serious suggestions please. No lectures. I know my mistakes. I just need to figure out the best way to mitigate my losses.

Note - I don't need this money right now. I have another non-margin account that I never look at because I have all the time in the world for the stocks to rebound. But I'm racing against margin on this one so I'm wondering the best way to handle it. Thanks"

2021-05-12 21:50:32,stocks,This is the most inflation since the end of 2008. Guess what happened a few years later? We got a massive bull run that is technically still going on. As long as interest rates are low there is nowhere else for investors to put there money in. The whales just sold their profits today due to uncertainty in the economy. They will buy back in at lower prices. Not sure why people are freaking out yet. Even if interest rates rise it will only rise slowly.
2021-05-12 22:53:41,stocks,"OP, close your margined positions and accept the losses is the correct decision. It is totally possible that you do that and it goes green from then on, but the result isn't what makes a good call in the markets. The reality is you do not have a good reason to be margining or averaging down into these securities besides your own emotional biases and you are exposing yourself to way too much risk, so you need to de-risk and regroup, and no matter what happens after if you do that you made the right call."

I was so close to margin call that I called the bank and took cash advances on credit cards to average down further. I lost a lot of sleep and was so over leveraged that I would have lost my entire savings had the market not recivered by March 2019. I am telling you this to warn you not to use margin to average down for 5,10,15% drops. Stocks can drop a LOT further. Try to get out of margin if possible or a atleast try not to use it further. Shit can go bad and we are technically not even in a correction. If a bear market happens this year which is a possibility, things can go real bad. Please try to minimize leverage. It's better to wait out downturns that to get a margin call."

2021-05-13 01:32:03,stocks,"Today's big CPI jump (inflation) triggered the sell-off.  The inflation tied to America's massive recent money printing is not going away.  Further broad market declines are possible, if not likely.  Look at your capital gains tax situation if you sell everything right now and pay off your margin loan.  Any overall loss will be mitigated by reducing your taxable income for the year.  Margin borrowing is dangerous right now, so zero that out right away.  That is my advice anyway, for whatever it is worth, good luck."

Seriously there are so many retail who started a few months ago and they are actively fucking up hedges funds ability to make money i.e. trade flows, unconventional strategies, risk for shorts etc. 

Of course institutions still hold the vast majority of shares but investing as a whole has been changed, its no longer seen as something only suits with advanced degrees can do. 

With that said, dont let fear overtake you, buy aapl, msft, dis, amzn and any good company with a future and keep buying down. No talking head is going to convince me to go into dying industries. Seriously go look at the max chart of us steel (something the media is pushing for hard) and compare to the stocks i listed. I know charts arent everything but they are useful for proving a point. INVEST WITH THE FUTURE IN MIND. It took 20 years to go from big ass heavy ass blocky telephones to iphone 12 pro max. What do you think tech will look like in 10 years let alone 20. 

After covid tech is just going to keep accelerating because the world has seen what it can achieve. Strong growth doesnt stop just because the stock drops in may 2021. Stock price will always reward you for growth, always. You just have to be patient and brave."

2021-05-12 20:42:45,stocks,"Yea, but I think the higher yields are impacting them. If hedge funds, PE, other large investors have been highly leveraging in this low interest world, they would be very sensitive to changes in yield and in turn interest rates. 

Think about it, we saw this with archegos, if money to trade on margin is basically free why would others not do it? Now put yourself as a trader for a highly leverage firm, you see yields going up fast, you recognize that they will fuck you, so you start selling parts of everything off to de-leverage."

Here are few ways you can handle this

2 few option strategies you can consider
     Sell covered call and buy put. So even if it goes further down u covered . Hedging cost is covered. This is better than 1 above. 
     Buy Leap call option and exit position this will help avoid FOMO and reduce u r exposure

It's not like they had a terrible earnings, or gambling rejected in NY, etc. It's all been decent news for the stock so the sell-off is insane.

I'm really tempted to just sell it all off but I know once I do, it'll begin to turn around and go back to 70"

2021-05-13 03:30:39,stocks,I don't understand this comment at all. If inflation is getting out of hand and the fed can't possibly stop it why would that trigger a sell off? If cash is going to lose its buying power over the course of the next few months why would selling equities and holding cash be more promising than just holding shares of solid companies?

#1 We don‚Äôt know how further this marker drops before things start getting back in shape and how long that might take 

#2 I started computing recovery percentages and opportunity costs. Eg. If a stock drops 50% down from $100 to $50, congrats! You now need a 100% rise up to JUST BREAK EVEN! That would likely take months, wherein I could possibly employ this capital somewhere else, based on more current situation (hedging against my bullish bets)"

Everyone knew they were going to post negative earnings on their recent report, but maybe fewer understand the reason; they spent lots last quarter lobbying to get more states on board with online sports betting and making headline partnerships with organizations like the NFL and UFC. Spend money then to make more money in the future. Just wait until the NFL season starts. People are going to be doing daily fantasy football in addition to straight sports betting."

It‚Äôs an expanding area that will eventually be universal (mobile betting). Large states such as: FL, OH, CA, TX, NY (5 of the largest 7 in the country; ~37% of the countries population) still don‚Äôt have mobile sports betting. 

And what is every average joe who normally wouldn‚Äôt bet on sports going to download to wager on their local team? Draftkings - a company they‚Äôve seen/heard about for the last 5 years in DFS on every Football Sunday.

Roughly $13 billion wagered on sports in 2019. Without the ability to wager on sports* in the four largest states in the country? (*can wager on sports in NY, but not mobile).

So far I'm confident these solid companies that are taking a haircut will rebound within the next few months. So I will keep the cycle going, which lowers my DCA and when the rebound happens I'll be sitting on a fat stack of blue chip shares and the tides will have turned in my favor.

2021-05-13 00:00:00,stocks,"Royal Helium - $RHC.V discovered a large amount of helium under 2 wells and are one step away from production on their third well!!! Royal Helium - $RHC.V discovered a large amount of helium under 2 wells and are one step away from production on their third well!!!

Today it was finally confirmed. 

A quote directly from Royal Helium‚Äôs CEO 

‚ÄúAndrew Davidson, President and CEO of Royal states, ""we are exceptionally pleased with this discovery at Climax. The Regolith appears to be helium charged over a significant interval and, once the production methodology is determined, it has the potential to be one of the largest helium discoveries in Saskatchewan history.‚Äù

Royal Helium - RHC.V one step away from production 

‚ÄúProduction planning will commence shortly on Climax-1, with the intent of producing and monetizing the helium, CO2, and nitrogen gas streams. Discussions with potential processing partners are underway and Royal will report once a gas processing agreement and off-take agreement(s) are in place.‚Äù

*A drilled helium well, once all the testing is complete, can start producing almost immediately. 

Royal helium plans on using a membrane system in order to filter the various gases from the well. Helium, being the smallest molecule, will be the gas left over in the end. The system is relatively small, about the size of a C-can, and the gas can be loaded directly from the wellhead.

Basically, Royal helium intends to use a transport truck which will carry a number of large cylinders. They intend to fill the cylinders at the wellhead and then transport them to a plant in Montana. The drive will take approximately 4-6 hours. Also, NA helium has a processing plant right next door.

Another method of generating revenue will be for outside companies to bring in their own equipment and purchase their helium directly from the wellhead.

This will also open the door for other Dynamic revenue sources, but at the time of this writing, I was not able to find more details.

The revenues generated from these first 3 wells will be used to finance the drilling operations on further wells, hence creating more revenue and starting a snowball effect. Royal helium estimates that it will take 6 months for a well to recover its cost of drilling and testing followed by 9.5 years of profit per well.*

The train is about to leave the station to the rocket pad. $RHC.V, at 56c a share, is a steal and it won‚Äôt last long.

There is now a tremendous amount of upside and very little risk. What else would anyone be looking for in a penny stock!!!"

2021-05-13 03:04:32,stocks,Party city can buy their helium directly from the well head
2021-05-12 20:06:06,stocks,"I understand what your saying. I should of included that in Saskatchewan, it is the only place in the world where helium is extracted as the primary product, NOT a by-product of natural gas. This means that will save a ton in costs. The helium can literally be sold directly from the well head. How they will separate the gases and transport it is in my original post.

There is no storing it and waiting for the price to go up. The price of helium has already gone up and will continue to go up... They literally extract it from the well head and ship it to the processing facility. A few years from now they will have built their own facility....

These Royal Helium wells are situated really close to the Canada/USA border. They can literally drive the helium to the processing plant in roughly 6 hrs in sealed cylinders. This will start generating the companies first revenue. It‚Äôs been years in the making and a long process.

Also NA Helium, another helium company, has a processing plant near their wells. It all depends on the agreements they will negotiate.

This is HUGE. The helium market is overlooked for the most part, not main stream news today. 

Just my take on it. There is too much DD for one post"
2021-05-13 00:00:00,stocks,"Inflation explained like you're five I started that as a comment but it became quite lengthy and I decided that it should be a separate post instead.

Let's say, currently the inflation is 0%, a burger costs $1 and a single stock  share of any company costs $20. You can buy 20 burgers if you sell that share.

Tomorrow the inflation becomes 10%. Everything is more expensive by 10%. The burger now costs $1.1, the share costs $22. You can still buy 20 burgers for that share. But if you have sold that share yesterday at $20, today you can buy only 18 burgers. Your money lost buying power due to inflation. That's why some people say that during the inflation it's better to have money in the market, you protect your money from losing value by buying stocks. But it's often not that simple, we'll return to this at the end.

The government doesn't like 10% inflation, it's too high. They like 5% inflation. To achieve that they need to decrease the demand for buying burgers. When less people compete for the goods, the price of those goods decreases. How can government decrease the demand? They do it by increasing the interest rate in banks. Now instead of spending $1.1 on the burger you can put that money into the bank, and over time your money will grow in value, and in 30 years you'll be able to buy 1000 burgers. Not everyone is capable of delayed gratification, so only part of people will put money into the bank, the others will continue buying burgers. Anyway, the demand decreases and eventually the burger price decreases to $1.05, that's 5% inflation, exactly what the government wants.

Now let's talk about the banks. How do they earn money? They do it by offering loans. Let's say, a fancy tech company wants to build SkyNet. They need to hire developers and they need money to pay those developers. The company does not earn anything yet, so the plan is to get money from the bank, build the product, then start earning and then repay the debts. Bank gives the money to that company and asks to return the same amount and 10% extra later. Where did bank get that money? Well, most likely they are just holding your salary on your bank account. Your money is safe, no one can steal it, and at the same time bank can use that money to give loans and earn interest. Everyone is happy.

You remember that the government increased the interest rate to fight the inflation, right? Previously your money was just sitting at the deposit and doing nothing. But now you started to earn some interest on it. Let's say, it's 5% per year. This makes banks sad, because instead of just using your money and getting extra 10% from the SkyNet company, they now also need to pay you those 5%. Obviously they won't pay it out of their own pockets. They will instead ask the SkyNet company to return not 10%, but 15% at the end of the loan period.

The SkyNet company now has to pay more to the banks. It's difficult as they have no earnings yet. Where do they take the money to pay banks? They have to issue more shares and sell it to investors. More shares means more supply. More supply means that the price of the good drops, so the shares of that company become much cheaper.

So, if you're sure that inflation is inevitable, how can you prepare for this? We discussed that a bit at the beginning. One option is to keep money in your account. Your $20 will lose some value, you'll be able to buy only 18 burgers instead of 20. Another option is to buy a share of the SkyNet company. As we've just discussed, it will likely drop in value and will cost like $12, you'll buy only 11 burgers for it. But who knows, maybe in 5 years it'll pay of. And a yet another options is to buy a share of the burger company. Since burgers became more expansive the company also earns more and its share is more valuable. Most likely it costs $25 now, and you can buy more burgers with it.

You've already figured it out. The burger company is what we call a value stock. The SkyNet company is the growth stock. And since everyone expects inflation, we currently observe the rotation from the growth stocks into the value stocks."

2021-05-13 04:43:29,stocks,Growth stocks that rely on future earnings will not do well in inflation. However some stocks can be both growth and value. Such as Apple. They can still grow a lot and at the same time increase their prices to keep up with inflation. The logic posted by OP is correct but just wanted to point out that growth and value are not always exclusive. Companies with good cash flows and a solid business model even tech companies will do just fine.

You forgot a couple of effects of higher interest rates:

   1. debt becomes more expensive so (e.g. Skynet) uses more of their profits to service their debts. Lower profits = lower dividends = lower stock price.
   2. people sell their stocks in order to put into savings as a guaranteed 5% rate is more attractive to them. Demand for stock drops and so does the price.

Also banks always take a cut so if the fed rate is 5% banks will pay 3.5% to savers and charge 10% for loans."

As I understand it banks actually only need a fraction of your deposit to loan out the sum of your whole deposit. Meaning banks actually only have a fraction of the money they loan out and are in a sense therefore creating new money when lending out to most customers.

Some people will pay even $1.3. Moral: buy all the burgers you want, anytime... as long as you sell your own burgers (or something of value that people want).

So the prime Ape decided to start over and lower the value of dollar by increasing the price of a banana 10% per year in order to keep apes producing more banana.

Bottom line, there is no reason to be selling apple and if people want to artificially lower the stock price to go chase value stocks, im not going to stop them and im not going to stop buying those apple shares from them for cheap. 

Fundamentally apple is trading at a p/e of around 24, which is honestly quite low for their growth prospects. In a year or two, macbooks should have much bigger market shares since everyone is moving to ARM and apple has been very successful with it and one of the first to do it in mass. Service revenue is only going to keep growing since iphone 12 has been a huge success and you can bet your ass people are going to sign up for apple music and podcasts when they go back to work. Apple is also going into the ev space somehow so looking forward to that in a few years. Therefore the growth of the company has clearly been driven by other revenue streams other than the iphone but they still leverage the billion iphone units out there, which is what a good business should do.

2021-05-13 00:00:00,stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Wednesday, May 12, 2021 PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, May 12, 2021

The selloff in stocks intensified after a report that showed the consumer price index (CPI) rose at a faster-than-expected pace, spooking market participants about the prospects of inflationary pressures, increasing pressure on equities. The S&P 500 (SPY) closed 2.09% down, the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) fell 2.54%, while the Dow Industrial Average (DIA) fell 2%, the worst slump since February.

The Bureau of Labor statistics reported that the consumer price index, which measures a basket of goods as well as energy and housing costs, rose 4.2% from a year ago, compared to the Dow Jones estimate for a 3.6% increase. The monthly gain was 0.8%, against the expected 0.2%. Excluding the volatile food and energy prices, the core CPI (this is the main measure of inflation) increased 3% compared to the same period in 2020 and 0.9% on a monthly basis. The respective estimates were 2.3% and 0.3%. This confirms fears market participants have had for months. Tomorrow, the producer price index will be released, which is expected to show a similar spike like the CPI. 

Market participants are worried that as the economy reopens and comes out of the pandemic, the surge in demand and consumer spending could drive a surge in prices, which, in turn, may prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates sooner-than-expected, pressuring the valuations of technology and growth stocks. However, while the readings in inflation definitely are not good, it is important to note that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has consistently reiterated he expects any rise in inflation to be ‚Äútransitory‚Äù as the economy continues to recover from the March and bottom and want to see a ‚Äústring‚Äù of strong labor reports totaling 1 million before. In an April 28 meeting Powell said, ‚ÄúAmid progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened. Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.‚Äù

While the inflationary readings are definitely not good, they weren‚Äôt unexpected and with the SPY trading near record levels for consecutive weeks and the stretched valuation of some technology, this week‚Äôs sell-off is not unexpected. In my opinion, the current fear around the equity market seems overblown, and though I expect volatility going forward, my long-term outlook remains bullish and will be looking to take advantage of this dip in the indexes and mega-caps. 

Moreover, the April Job Report, released last Friday, showed the US economy only added 266,000 new jobs last month, missing estimates of more than 1 million jobs gained and marking a sharp deceleration from March‚Äôs total of 916,000 new jobs added. As said earlier, members of the Federal Reserve, including Powell, have consistently reiterated they want to see a   
‚ÄúString‚Äù of strong labor reports before considering any changes to the current policy. Talking about the March Job report, Powell said, ‚ÄúWe want to see a string of months like that \[like in March\] so we can really begin to show progress toward our goals. We just need to keep reminding ourselves that even though some parts of the economy are starting just great, there‚Äôs a very large group of people who are not.‚Äù The April Job Report bolsters Powell‚Äôs argument that large segments that the Federal Reserve will move slowly in changing policy. 

In addition, at a separate event in April, Powell said that quantitative easing would likely taper ‚Äúwell before‚Äù the interest rate is increased. He said, ‚ÄúWe will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.‚Äù In short, while the inflationary readings are not great, I‚Äôm fairly confident fears that the Federal Reserve will tighten policy sooner than expected are overblown.

I started pouring my savings into the market back in March after making $60 on GME for shits 'n giggles. I did the research, read the books and built a Bogle-approved (seemingly balance) portfolio weighted towards broad index ETF's (domestic and international), plus a handful of blue-chips (AAPL, MSFT, etc.). I happily watched my equity go up $800+ over the last few months, only to watch those gains disappear in the last week or two.

Then, today, it finally happened. My portfolio went red.

I know this is normal, and likely a product of WHEN I got into the market  (March 2021), but that knowledge doesn't make the setback any less discouraging. I'm in this for the long-haul, but am curious how you guys deal with days like this so it doesn't affect your mental health?"

That being said, I need to understand more, and I was hoping for my questions to be answered on here. Take note, as you can guess from my questions, I know nothing about the field. The chart i'm using for oil is here [https://oilprice.com/oil-price-charts/](https://oilprice.com/oil-price-charts/)

So here are my general questions for oil:

**- If oil prices rise/drop, what happens to oil stocks? My guess is if oil prices increase, certain stock prices, such as $USO increase along with it. Is it bad if oil prices increase? Right now the price is at $65. If it goes to $66, what would happen to $USO, and what would happen to a gas company, such as $BP?**

**- What should i be looking for in terms of news relating to oil, and what type of catalysts can cause an increase in an oil stock's price, or more importantly (to me) a decrease in an oil stock's price?**

**- What stocks, outside of gas companies, oil rigs, and anything that produces/distributes oil, is heavily reliant on oil?** 

**- The Biden administration has made it clear that they are trying to steer the US into ""green"" energy. What does that say for the near future for oil/oil companies?**

2021-05-13 00:00:00,stocks,"The latest CPI numbers can be explained by the Semiconductor and Lumber Shortage A lot of you have looked at the numbers, but how many of you have actually looked INTO the numbers? I'm going to break down the numbers, and tell you why you're worrying your heads off over nothing. Precursor: Shit hasn't changed, inflation is no more than it was last month.

#The month on month data:

There's a lot of information to take in, so I'll do my best to explain it in the comments, to anyone confused by what I'm saying. A lot of the explanations are very simple but here goes:

- All items less food and energy account for 79.125 weighting on the whole CPI. Digging into the data, the more heavily weighted portions is commodities less food and energy commodities (which carrys 20 weight). Furniture and bedding increased 2.1% (0.94 Weight). Living room, kitchen and dining furniture accounted for most of this (2.8% change), which can be attributed to the increasingly high lumber prices. 

- Transport commodities less motor fuel was helped push this number up quite a bit, seeing a 4.3% change, which is a 7 weighting. These include new and used vehicles, of which used vehicles sales solely drived up, with a change of 10% which can be attributed to the semiconductor shortage.

- Recreation commodities were up 1.2%, with a weighting of 1.9, with video and audio products essentially carrying this number above average with the help of recreational reading material (1.5%), toys (2.7%), information technology commodities (3.6%), and miscellaneous personal goods (2.1%).

As you can see, a lot of these either involved lumber, or semiconductors. These were all the sectors above the average, and a couple below, the rest managed to pull the full percentage of commodities less energy and food commodities down to a 2%.

The next sector we need to look into is Services less energy services (59 weighting).

- No big increases here in heavily weighted areas. Notable changes were a 7.6% change in Lodging away from home (0.9 weighting), a 10.2% change in Airline fares (0.59 weighting), and a 3.4% change in admissions (0.664 weighting) 

As you can see, this CPI didn't give any clear indiction of inflation. Each significant rise that significantly affected the CPI could be explained by the lumber and semiconductor shortage. There is so much fearmongering going around right now, that I felt like I had to put this out there, because clearly people aren't too willing to look deep into this. 

#The Year on Year CPI data:

If you really think this is evidence of inflation, you're not thinking straight. You're measuring from the bottom of the market, just after the pandemic became real, to where we stand now. 

Anyways, throw any questions my way, or you can find the CPI data if you think I've made all these numbers up. 

TLDR: No inflation (Well there is inflation, obviously, but you get what I mean), lumber and semiconductor shortage help to explain everything."

2021-05-13 00:00:00,stocks,"$CREG my value play I've been looking for a deep value play for a while and after reading the little book of value investing and applying practices covered within the book I came across this diamond.

The company began operations as a¬†microbrewery¬†of beers in 1980. On August 6, 2004, it changed its name from Boulder Acquisitions, Inc. to China Digital Wireless, Inc., marketing in pager and mobile phone distribution until May 10, 2007, when the company completely ceased these businesses. In December 2006, the company extended its business to the energy saving and recycling industry. On March 8, 2007, it finally changed its name to current China Recycling Energy Corporation.

The company manufactures various energy-generation projects from the byproducts of industrial processes, such as blast furnace top gas recovery turbine (TRT) unit (using exhaust pressure and heat emitted from industrial processes), waste gas power generation (WGPG) systems, combined cycle power plant (CCPP) systems;¬†biomass power generation systems (BMPG); and¬†wate heat ¬†power generation (WHPG) systems.

The company has a strategic cooperation agreement for three-year exclusive support in business development with CGN Energy Service Co., Ltd. The subsidiaries of the company are: Sifang Holdings, Huahong New Energy Technology Co., Ltd. (Huahong) and Shanghai TCH ( with three subsidiaries: Xi‚Äôan TCH Energy Technology Company, Ltd (Xi‚Äôan TCH) and Xingtai Huaxin Energy Tech Co., Ltd. (Huaxin), and Xi‚Äôan TCH‚Äôs subsidiary Erdos TCH Energy Saving Development Co., Ltd (Erdos TCH)).

In October 2011, China Recycling Energy Corporation completed an acquisition of a 12-megawatt biomass power generation system from Shenqiu Yuneng Thermal Power Co., Ltd.

In June 2011, the system of the project ZhongBao was sold to and leased back from Cinda Financial Leasing Co., Ltd

As a future play, personally as I see resources drying up and coal and oil being phased out. The world is still not in a full position for the transition fully over to solar, wind and tidal technologies. Therefore technology such as biomass energy generation from the burning of recycled waste is a viable option which creates a use for waste accumulating on landfill sites and can help provide the transition from fossil fuels and provide energy for the installation of green infrastructure.

As a value play; $CREG is currently trading at a price to book ratio of 0.2 that states that this company has 5 times more cash on hand in assets than it is currently trading at on the stock market.

It has a current ratio of 2.67 which shows that it can pay its short term debts off 2.67 times over with current cash on hand.

The company currently has $92,000,000 worth of assets and if we looked at cash per a share this stock is at $24.59 it is currently trading at $7.90 as we speak so if you want to 3x in the next year this is a deep value play."

2. I know I should take my money out, that's a given, but what do I do after. Technically I could wait for it to drop more and buy the stocks back when it starts to show signs of rising. Or I could just go lick my wounds and invest my, now much smaller, amount of money in some other stocks. This is what I think is the most reasonable thing to do.
3. I could also sit on the stock and just sell it back when it rises again but there's no indication if the stock will ever even do that. I'm not really keen on doing this as I know that inaction is many times worse than action, both in life and in stocks."

2021-05-12 22:25:57,stocks,"I think timing the market is stupid. Generally I think spending a large portion of your savings on individual stocks is also pretty dumb.

Where I am getting at with my post is this sub is sort of becoming an echo chamber of terrible advice and practice. People are continually expecting another massive bull run and are using phrases like these to encourage group think.

Furthermore data shows that 96% of stocks underperform the US treasury bill. Why put faith in thinking your picks are great when the odds are against you?

I use 5% of my savings for individual stocks just to scratch the itch. I have some companies I think will do well but have a price goal to sell. 

What‚Äôs happening here is it seems many new investors are being encouraged to put large portions of their savings in individual stocks, which is statistically a very bad idea."

I‚Äôve lost all my gains and currently have most my portfolio allocated in Amazon and Apple, which I bought for high but not unreasonable prices. To be clear, even in the face of potentially higher interest rates/inflation scares, it still makes sense to hold these right? Is their any argument to rotate to something even more conservative (ei. VTI or something) and then rotate back in in a few months until scares of inflation/interest rates have settled?"
2021-05-12 20:25:58,stocks,"""If you can't hold your stocks after a 50% drop without feeling panic, you shouldn't be in the stock market""

""Sometimes we  buy high prices sometimes we have low, we should embrace both""

\~Warren Buffet

Ironically, shortly after Buffett invested in the 80's or 90's in wells fargo it dropped by 50% He also bought more at lower prices....

When you invest, it is the company, if you liked those companies at higher prices, why don't you LOVE them at lower prices...? If you have done your due diligence it shouldn't matter...If companies have a good financial report and good ratios the market price isn't very relevant...

Listen, just consider this....You bought rising tech stocks while other sectors were down...Now the other sectors are on the rise and tech is going down...you want to put money in only the rising sectors or conservative? that doesn't seem like an efficient way to max profits..Buying at peak prices but not on the lower prices.

This is just some food for thought,

Should you invest in something more conservative like VTI? sure, if it has what you are looking for and you think it is a good buy, but I don't think it is a good idea to pull out of other investments unless you realized you made a error...the more you tinker your investments the more likely you are to miss out...Money is made by time in the market, not timing the market...picture yourself 10 years from now, do you really think you will say ""man i'm glad I sold apple in 2021 to rotate into VTI"" seems unlikely......we don't know how long things will go down, but these are when we need to be observant on buying opportunity...

Do your homework, have confidence, and invest smartly...."

Apple would be a buy at around 100 USD per share if you look at DCF analysis. But that is only if inflation doesn't rise and interest rates stay low.   


You could just start diversifying so tech doesn't take up more than 20% of your portfolio, buy some sectors which protect from inflation so your portfolio doesn't go double down but stabilizes as one sector goes down and the other rises."

Basically everything with relatively low valuation and low growth that can pass on higher prices and has stable demand. I exclude companies like Nestl√©, Danone, P&G and peers because they will be hit by higher procurement cost (they will have to pass them to consumers though) and their high valuations.

Stay away from high growth companies as an increase in borrowing cost will increase WACC (cost of debt) and lower NPV significantly. The value of a growth company depends to a large extend on future cash-flows."

The investment seeks to provide income and capital appreciation from investments in the U.S. market while protecting against significant downside risk. The fund is actively managed and seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing in cash and U.S. government bonds, and utilizing a put option strategy to manage the risk of a significant negative movement in the value of domestic equities. The adviser intends to spend approximately one percent of the fund's total assets per month to purchase put options."

Even if the selloff is uncertainty, the price should rebound if the underlying business is healthy and the future outlook is good.

Can you explain what you are referring to here? What you described is bribery, which Congress people do go to jail for (if you don't believe me, Google it). I understand that campaign finance is a complicated topic with all kinds of confusing rules and regulations. But, no, lobbyists are not just handing politicians briefcases full of cash. That's not a thing.

I support getting money out of politics. But I have experience working in campaign finance and you have no idea what you're talking about. Most members of Congress are independently wealthy before they even run for office. Money from lobbyists is not just deposited into their personal bank accounts. It goes into PACs and campaign committees, which you will go to jail if you misuse the funds ([e.g. Rep. Duncan Hunter](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/us/duncan-hunter-sentencing.html))

I'm not sure where you're getting the 7 figure thing from. That must be about PACs or SuperPACs, which Congresspeople do not control. That's not to say that the lobbying system doesn't encourage corruption. It does. But nobody is getting bags full of cash a la Spiro Agnew. It's much more complicated than that."

Edit: I was basically being pedantic. Assuming OP‚Äôs data is accurate (which I have no reason to doubt) than I was just pointing out that the math doesn‚Äôt show that congressmen should, or are expected to, outperform the market. Just that they have on average, within this specific dataset. 

Basically, every claim that this is obvious insider trading is just an extrapolation without solid statistical backing.  They may very well be right, but it wouldn‚Äôt be enough for a scientific journal."

Assuming if my above paragraph wasnt completely false, when it says quarterly, are they all done on a specific date 4 times in a year? Assuming if so, what happens if you bought like in the middle of February, which is like halfway through the first quarter of a year, do you get a dividend at the end of March?

2021-05-12 23:40:13,stocks,"Covid comes. 

Economy crashes. 

Fed says it's time for interest rates to be low

Interest rates are low so people borrow tons of money to either help for the financial crises or re-invest into their companies

Growth companies take on tons of debt and don't really make money. They continue to lose to the debt they take on. No worries though, interest rates are zero so paying people back is no biggy

Inflation comes. Fed says 'no worries. Even though inflation, we keep interest rates low' (raising interest rates stops inflation)

Others don't believe this. 'The Fed is lying. Inflation is bad and they will raise interest rates'

If they do raise interest rates, then all those growth companies are now paying tons of money for all they borrowed and it eats into whatever income they would currently have had. This is baaad news if you are a company with debt.

Sell off of companies with debt for fear of raising interest rates"

Markets go up and down, and sometimes the down lasts for years.  We're currently less than 10% from all time highs on every major us market, so if you're deep red then it's mostly because you put your money into high risk unprofitable companies or companies trading at 50x sales.  

If it was as easy as yoloing into pltr because they're gaurenteed to be worth trillions one day then they'd have that valuation well before you got there.

For the last category I also make sure they're booking either profits or at least positive FCF. If they're not they need very high growth rates and a realistic plan to become profitable.

If you don't feel strongly about a company don't buy it. You'll have red days and it's a lot easier to avoid panic selling for a loss if you're actually convinced you have a long-term winner."

We're in the middle of a pullback that has returned us to levels that are still up from Jan 1st across the 3 US markets.  We may drop another 15 percent and stay there for a year, or we could bounce up by mid day today.  Both are possible, and if you're investing you should understand that.

Stocks go up and come down based on a lot of things and yes, the short term doesnt always make sense.  Its not a conspiracy when there are more sellers than buyers, it's just how markets are.  Companies can have great earnings and still fall because more people are wanting to sell than buy, and that happens when lots of growth is already priced in.

Disney is not a value stock - it is currently at a 5.3 price to sales ratio.  Their historic five year average is about 3.  I did some DD on them when they were over 200 and set a personal price target of 140.  They may never get that low again depending on how much future growth continues to be priced in, but it's clear they are currently extended well past their historic valuation, even at 170."

2021-05-12 21:00:10,stocks,"This is literally fallacious thinking, though. The market doesn't care what price you got in at; all that matters is what is going to happen with the stock going forward. If you wouldn't by in the stock at X price after a dip relative to another opportunity, then there's no logical reason to stay at X.  People tend to stick to what they already ""possess"" without ever doing a fair analysis of whether money would be better spent elsewhere.

Now I DO agree that an amateur investor gambling with money is probably better off just leaving their money somewhere rather than chasing the next gamble. And I also agree that if a person actually did the proper research and bought in a stock based on fundamentals and outlook, then a temporary dip in the short term should not deter them. Aside from those circumstances, people should always be evaluating opportunity cost. The amount of capital in play has nothing to do with it."

2021-05-12 21:12:45,stocks,">People tend to stick to what they already ""possess"" without ever doing a fair analysis of whether money would be better spent elsewhere.

Analysis and risk assessment is something you should've done before buying a stock, not after, and you wouldn't be able to factor new opportunity cost at that point as you can't predict when your stock will dip and what opportunities will be available at that point (would be strange to buy something you predict to sell at a loss).

If you wouldn't buy a stock after a dip without an actual reason for it other than the dip, then you had no fundamental reason for buying the stock in the first place. ""I might make more money over here"" as a catalyst for selling suggests little to no thought put into investing at all. If there's a fundamental reason like failed R&D or a path to bankruptcy then absolutely, you shouldn't ignore reality and you should sell if you're overexposed, but that's different from chasing opportunity cost."

This is what made the pandemic hit so difficult to play at the time. Also, not sure what you mean by ""clearest market signal."" Buying heavily in March/April would have been a gamble, not investing. The indicators at the time signaled a high potential for even more red (notable bankrupting of companies with limited cash reserves), ridiculously high unemployment, and a long recovery. Once it became clear the fed wasn't going to let any of that happen, *then* one can say the signals were there to buy the ""sale."" Before then, I don't buy it. It's just hindsight bias."

But, the way i see it, in the end the fundamentals that are driving the high lumber prices havent changed, and dont look like they will any time soon. People still buying up homes left and right, so the mills still selling wood faster than they can make it.  If the story hasnt changed and best days still ahead, why sell? 

Even with futures down a few days, they are just too high and need some healthy correction. The real sweet spot is 1000-1200. Excellent margina for lumber, without being too ridiculous for most consumers. If lumber can hold there or higher into fall, i think that‚Äôs when the bull thesis will really win out over the bear thesis. But we‚Äôll see. Hang in there!"

2021-05-12 22:06:41,stocks,"I actually recommend staying away from LMND. Their Q1 report was really worrisome imho. Firstly, I think their stock is going to slide to the mid-50's. Their growth doesn't justify their P/S ratio. They put on 10% more customers in Q1 and increased revenue per customer by about 10%.

But here is the most concerning thing. Their gross loss ratio on premium is only 70%. And that is tight by insurance standards. Most standard insurance companies carry a gross loss ratio between 40% and 60%: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_ratio

Unless LMND can make up that ratio by cutting costs by committing harder to AI, I don't see how this works out for them. Look at their recently Texas Storm payout. For the past 12 quarters, they're lowered their gross loss ratio from 89% down to 71%. But then one bad event in Texas caused a gross loss ratio of 121%. That means they paid out 21% MORE revenue than they took in Q1. And since they're only saving about 15% on average, and the percentages are based on increasing total premium, they're in a position where just a few major weather events can destroy their bottom line.

Think about it this way: how many more major weather events do you expect to occur that could cause this kind of insurance claim profile? Do you think extreme weather events will get worst or better in the future? This payout occurred with only one state. What happens when a hurricane comes through and ravages the entire east coast? Or when fires destroy all of California again?

Their gross loss ratio is concerning to me because it creates a profile that makes the company much more risky than before.

I wouldn't get in until the P/S ratio on LMND falls into the mid/low 20's. Which means the price has to drop an additional 25% for me. Just my 2c."

Lots of that can go to the bottom line. It looks like EPS is forecasted to grow 18% per year for the next 5 years, which sounds like a miracle frankly. Anyway with a forward P/E of 23.6, that's a PEG of 1.3, which is not bad but I'm seeing FB with a 0.92 and BABA at .98, and that's after today's drop.

2021-05-12 21:02:39,stocks,Rightfully right. Oddly enough it's his only decent sized bet that hasn't already paid off. He put some money on a competitor which is paying off handsomely already.
2021-05-13 06:48:53,stocks,"Thanks for explaning..! So the acquisition was successful and BioLife now owns Stirling? Im cautious to invest in this company due to my lack of specialist knowledge of the subject, but from what Ive read it all seems very promising as a potentially huge growth company!"
2021-05-13 09:44:30,stocks,"Correct, the merger was completed  and successful.  

BLFS has made a lot of acquisitions over the last couple of years.  This has been bad for investors over the short term due to the dilution of their shares.  Over the long term, I think it gives the company a major advantage over their competitors as they can now cover the entire spectrum of cold storage for biotech companies.  This should give them a strong competitive advantage that will hopefully result in significant revenue growth in the foreseeable future."

2021-05-13 09:12:33,stocks,The problem with an ETF is that it can stunt growth. It may do really good if the highest percentage stocks takeoff but it may be dragged down if the high number stocks lag. I would rather have a possible 10 bagger than a Etf that is a slow growth option. Do your due dilligence and you should do well. Personally I prefer Cloudmd as they make better aquisitions.  I find Well heath buys some of their companies that aren't exactly doing well financially.
2021-05-12 23:16:10,stocks,"Alright, so the stock dropped to under 35 at its lower point and during After Hours. As a disclaimer I sold all of mine at a stop loss. The question now is if the current price can hold and if it will be worth it"
