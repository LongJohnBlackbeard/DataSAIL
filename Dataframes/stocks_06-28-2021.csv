6/28/2021 19:56,stocks,Short term theyll face a harsher correction as they're growth stocks but in the long run they'll be fine
6/28/2021 19:49,stocks,Maybe
6/28/2021 19:56,stocks,Set a stop loss in case it does tank.
6/28/2021 19:46,stocks,"Those are long term 5-10+ year holds, especially ARKG"
6/28/2021 19:12,stocks,"I don't know Walmart's balance sheet, but I'd assume being brick & mortar expenses + their sheer number of employees would reduce their net profit a lot more than Apple's"
6/28/2021 19:15,stocks,“Net” margin for Walmart is less than 2% (1.97) and for Apple is 26.38%.  It’s not the only factor of course….
6/28/2021 19:26,stocks,"1. Highest revenue does not mean highest profits. I’m not familiar with Walmart’s financials but Walmart has massive bricks and sticks stores and warehouses all over the place that are very expensive. 
2. Stock prices and in turn market caps are determined by the present value of expected future cash flows. The price is not only indicative of what they are doing now, but what investors expect them to do in the future. I think it’s fair to say that Walmart doesn’t have nearly as much growth potential as some of the tech companies mentioned."
6/28/2021 19:31,stocks,"Well you say “judging by revenue and profit”, but then you only judged by revenue. Apple actually made 57 billion in profit in 2020, Walmart made just 15 billion in profit. 

The other aspect is that companies get valued more highly if, simply put, people expect them to keep making more and more profits in the future. People expect that Apple will develop new products and continuously grow. People expect that Walmart will continue to finetune its operations and maybe squeeze a bit more money out of what they are already doing."
6/28/2021 19:16,stocks,Making money is the important part.  Revenue is huge but the margins are tiny compared to many other cap light businesses.
6/28/2021 19:18,stocks,"Stagnant growth compared to other companies, feels like they aren't gonna be much more successful than they are now. Potential is a big player in stocks and Walmart doesn't have it anymore. It just is what it is"
6/28/2021 19:21,stocks,"What you want when you pick a stock to buy is an investment.  You're anticipating that the price of the stock will go up because more and more people will want to buy it.

Wal-Mart is a very mature company.  Like McDonalds.  Been around forever, had plenty of time to grow and be everywhere.  

So nobody is going to buy Wal-Mart because they are expanding into Florida - They're already in Florida..

Now Amazon comes along and says hey I'll sell you anything Wal-Mart has, and more, for less, and I'll drop it off at your house.

Its hard to see how it'll affect brick and mortars.  Because it is nice to get to try something on or hold it in your hand before you buy it.  But Amazon has reviews and its just gotten to the point where you can kind of trust the reviews and that'll only become more true the more they sell.  

So in short, Mature company, not a lot of room to grow because they are already everywhere, Amazon poses serious threat.  Its hard to be a catch all stop.  Too many things in todays world.  Thats why even chewy was able to take a share of Amazon's e-commerce."
6/28/2021 19:20,stocks,"The margins for net profit are much, much higher for Apple. Walmart in comparison has a much larger expense to staff, maintain buildings, and operate a supply chain. These are extremely cash and labor intensive."
6/28/2021 19:33,stocks,"I’m a word, groceries."
6/28/2021 19:34,stocks,"There are a variety of different factors that play into your question. Looking at revenue is a very narrow view of a company. A company could make billions in revenue and still be losing money. Someone pointed out profit margins. Grocery stores are notorious for their low profit margins. Low profit margins mean lower growth, usually. You also have to factor in operating costs, debt load, the inability of walmart to do away with physical stores. How much cash on hand does Walmart have? How much cash on hand does apple have? There is a limited amount of innovation one can bring to the grocery store space, whereas, the sky is the limit with apple (generally speaking). This is where future growth comes into play and future possibilities of cash flow. Yes, I do realize Walmart is expanding and growing into other spaces, but these aren't high growthy areas. However, Walmart is a stable company and will be around for a long time even if the economy takes a tumble, but apple's bottom line will take a hit if this happens. So when there's a downturn, apple will fall significantly further from where it is now relative to Walmart."
6/28/2021 19:42,stocks,"Apple is a tech company that can continue pushing new products and services in a growing industry. Walmart is primarily a retail company. Retail companies primarily earn their money through volume sales. Walmart's operating income has been rather stagnant for the past few years and international sales are lagging behind. Revenue is one metric but the ability to turn margins is more important. Operating margin is 4%.

Walmart is a decent company to hold particularly during down markets but if you're looking for growth stocks and companies, you have other options. They're not in the business of pulling crazy growth yoy. You also have to consider the crazy competition they operate in particularly against Amazon. Going H2H with Amazon will cost Walmart a ton of money."
6/28/2021 19:13,stocks,"I’m a novice investor but market cap valuations make no sense to me especially when the company reports a loss but it’s a “better loss than anticipated”, yet the market cap is insane"
6/28/2021 19:53,stocks,Wow Apple profit margin is 26%?? That’s fucking insane
6/28/2021 19:17,stocks,Thats the majority of it.  I can't believe this is a serious question
6/28/2021 19:40,stocks,"I’ve actually heavily loaded Wal-Mart in the past 6 months. What you wrote was true, before the pandemic. Now they have a taste of online shopping, curbside pickup, and online membership. 

They are in a struggle with Amazon to be the retailer of choice for the next generation and the most important thing is Amazon is fighting wars against Netflix, EBay, Kroger, and a dozen other proven companies and Wal-Mart can singularly set its sights squarely on Amazon. They have the supply chain, purchase power, and reach to thrive under inflation. They already have private label cemented (Amazon is struggling here) and DTC will enormously effect margins to the positive side. They already have 99% of the American population within a one hour delivery window, a heavy investment in autonomous driving and drone advancement. 

Their future is looking bright IMO."

6/28/2021 19:19,stocks,"cause markets are forward looking. One possible interpretation of your example is that if the losses were better than expected, it means they are likely to become profitable sooner than expected"
6/28/2021 19:32,stocks,Hey 12 years old or 68 years old - sometimes that last dumb question is what gets it all to click
6/28/2021 19:32,stocks,"Have you seen comments sections on other apps?

There are people on the S&P500 Index ticker asking, ""why can't I invest in this stock???"""
6/28/2021 19:29,stocks,"[http://c46b2bcc0db5865f5a76-91c2ff8eba65983a1c33d367b8503d02.r78.cf2.rackcdn.com/6c/20/87b0b3df469ebee838a2630c2c1a/2010-annual-report-for-walmart-stores-inc\_130221021765802161.pdf](http://c46b2bcc0db5865f5a76-91c2ff8eba65983a1c33d367b8503d02.r78.cf2.rackcdn.com/6c/20/87b0b3df469ebee838a2630c2c1a/2010-annual-report-for-walmart-stores-inc_130221021765802161.pdf)

so here is the annual report from 2010.  Notice how their sales were 5-10% increase every year from 2005-2009.  Then only 1% in 2010, as amazon was arriving.  Investors see that, pull money from walmart stock throw it into amazon stock.Amazon has 1.7T market cap which is basically as high as it gets.  Not #1 but almost.  So there you have it.

I was going to say at least wal-mart has groceries, but amazon is start to do that too."
6/28/2021 19:34,stocks,....or look a couple lines down from where he pulled revenue from and it will show net income🙄🙄🙄🙄
6/28/2021 19:35,stocks,"Dude stop motorboating my mother please

She’s been complaining for weeks"
6/28/2021 19:27,stocks,It would take a long time for institutions to unwind a 98% ownership in a company (unless it was a complete fire sale). Was this on a specific equity or just a general question?
6/28/2021 19:41,stocks,$JELD went from 104% institutional ownership like 2 weeks ago then today saw the 98% down to 0% -im curious. I own a couple shares because I work in the same industry (not for the company) so i’ve been watching it here and there.
6/28/2021 19:43,stocks,"Let me guess, they don’t actually invest in any Bitcoin companies"
6/28/2021 19:52,stocks,"ArkT (tesla) after that, it has tsla, tesla holding trust, tesla b class shares, arkk, DE and NFLX."
6/28/2021 19:22,stocks,hoping a crypto etf proves they arent churning cash grabs? lol
6/28/2021 19:05,stocks,ARKX has yet to do anything.  I think she’s just doubling down off of her past success with these new ETFs to get some quick cash before her 15 minutes are up.
6/28/2021 19:32,stocks,"ARKX is a fund pretty much made to amass positions and wait at the sideline until SPACEX goes public (and follow-up with more space operation companies that get up to speed with the space era). So it's a LONG-term play. The ""disappointing reveal"" was allocation of whoever afforded/wanted to get onboard this train from day one. A train that isn't getting anywhere really far until more than  like 5-10 (?) years out.

(Unless you thought that once ARKX launched, technology would instantaneously progress to the point of being able to colonize Mars and mine in the asteroid belt...)

So, for some investors it just makes sense to allocate TODAY instead of trying to time when technology will actually enable at-scale operations in space.

Also,

""churning out ETFs to reap management fees"" is the same level of FUD that was going around the last 4 months during the big pullback (which CW specifically warned investors about BEFORE it happened) where haters were prancing around subreddits claiming that ARKs are about to shutdown and that CW is a snakeoil saleswoman trying to keep her management fees.

If you have constructive criticism regarding either ARKs or BTC/crypto it's cool, let's hear it. As it is though, this post reads more like an indirect passive/aggressive accusation of CW being a scammer and looks like it's trying to get the hater bandwagon back together..."
6/28/2021 19:37,stocks,"I'm still looking at all my losses from ARKK, not sure if I'm fully trusting a new BTC ETF right now."
6/28/2021 19:37,stocks,"\> I'm a little concerned that ARK is just churning out etfs to reap management fees

Just ""a little concerned""?"
6/28/2021 19:05,stocks,Presumably not tho!
6/28/2021 19:05,stocks,I’m buying when it comes out
6/28/2021 19:59,stocks,Cathie is fine af
6/28/2021 19:20,stocks,"I think ARKX has a lot of potential. It just debuted at a rough patch for the stock market (what they called a ""Kangaroo Market"").  If it would have came out in Q2 2020 instead, it'd be a very different story. I wish they'd do a Crypto ETF instead of just BTC. Have a large portfolio, just like their other ETFs. They could trade to profit off swings. I'd buy in for sure."
6/28/2021 19:27,stocks,"Guess who's got two thumbs and won't be investing in that shit (thumb emotes redacted by Nazi mods)

I'm in on ARKQ tho"
6/28/2021 19:09,stocks,It just came out. All of these are long term holds
6/28/2021 19:15,stocks,"I had the same thought re: ARKX not doing anything then I did the math and reassessed that evaluation. The closing price of ARKX today has it up 5.8% since it's end of march debut. I am not saying it is a to the moon launch but, it is on pace for \~25% gain this year if it maintained that. If she can get in on SpaceX IPO (which is something she discussed) then it would go up significantly on that event. If you were to get in now with the intent to hold past SpaceX IPO you are likely to see some significant returns. Also macro in the time since its debut saw a big sector swap from tech. So all things considered it performed decently in that time."
6/28/2021 19:50,stocks,It's up like 5 or 6% since debut. Boy you is dumb if you think that's not doing anything.
6/28/2021 19:30,stocks,Have patience jeezus Chris!!!
6/28/2021 19:10,stocks,"i agree. while i absolutely love arkw and arkf as well as cathie, i find arkx to be super weird"
6/28/2021 19:41,stocks,"So you're literally agreeing then that arkx is just reaping management fees lmao. Look, I think cathie is brilliant but she's not infallible. Spce is definitely one of her biggest mistakes. I personally just don't see a reason why a space etf exists yet. It's wayyyy too early imo and if she just opened it to place stable holdings (I haven't checked in a while but I'm pretty sure they're very safe), that's Literal fee grabbing.

Her other etfs are fine. I don't see why she needed to create arkx. Regarding btc, I'm very interested in seeing how she sets herself apart from blok. She has said herself that btc can't be held in an etf due to tax structures. I'm hoping for the best but expecting the worst."
6/28/2021 19:43,stocks,Arkx is the only etf that makes no sense based on its holdings. The rest are fine
6/28/2021 19:23,stocks,Why. Why not just buy bitcoin directly?
6/28/2021 19:47,stocks,i will be shorting.
6/28/2021 19:26,stocks,Literally anything would have done good if it came out in q2 2020....
6/28/2021 19:15,stocks,yes and the holdings of it were super weird
6/28/2021 19:48,stocks,SpaceX or Starlink? There's a pretty significant difference between the two.
6/28/2021 19:49,stocks,Wait SpaceX is going public?
6/28/2021 19:58,stocks,"I bought plenty, but I have no patience."
6/28/2021 19:57,stocks,"Definitely not infallible, and yes the buy high sell low on SPCE was a clear example of that. 

We'll see though though about fee grabbing. If within a year there's more commercial interest in space operations and SPACEX is public with ARKX having grabbed a large chunk early enough I'd easily justify ARKX's fees.

But as I said we'll have to w8 & see about that."
6/28/2021 19:54,stocks,My ETFs have treated me well so far. My ETH has been a rollercoaster of emotions lately. Diversification tells me to do both.
6/28/2021 19:18,stocks,Point is it’s too early to judge
6/28/2021 19:52,stocks,"What’s weird about it? People that are directly involved in space exploration, people that support space exploration and people that directly benefit from space exploration. Things are early in development, I’m sure we’ll see things changing quite a bit in the future."
6/28/2021 19:59,stocks,"> ARKX is an actively-managed exchange-traded fund (“ETF”) that will invest under normal circumstances primarily (at least 80% of its assets) in domestic and foreign equity securities of companies that are engaged in the Fund’s investment theme of Space Exploration and innovation.   

And yet they missed [MTAR Technologies Ltd.](https://mtar.in/space-isro/) but have Netflix, Albibaba, and Google in there.    

Also it feels like [Hexagon](https://hexagon.com/about/divisions) should be there given Dassault is...

This is why there needs to be a reference index so that people can compare or even know what companies are there."
6/28/2021 19:02,stocks,so change the timeframe from 1min to whatever you want it to be
6/28/2021 19:58,stocks,Yes but I need to download this data into Excel.

6/28/2021 18:32,stocks,Bought some short term calls today on the dip. July $7.50 at 1.35. Hoping the guidance is strong along with good earnings forecast. SMBI dumped before earnings too. Hoping today was a similar situation and we rip later this week

Revenue guidance for the quarter of $24 million – a 400% increase in comparison to the $4.8 million for the Fiscal 2020 quarter.

The Company is also confirming 2021 Fiscal Year revenue guidance of $62 million, representing year-over-year projected revenue growth of 319%.

These guys recently acquired gunbroker.com the god damn EBAY of guns and ammo.

6/28/2021 17:44,stocks,Down during the day and up in after hours trading.
6/28/2021 17:54,stocks,why is there a 'buy' and an 'overweight'? guessing overweight is REALLY good?
6/28/2021 17:43,stocks,"""bullish"" mean they think it will go up."
6/28/2021 18:23,stocks,Overweight references an amount.  Not a specific number but just an area on a scale
6/28/2021 16:06,stocks,"I think so, as you might have spotted a company that deserves a larger weighting than the etf is currently giving to the stock.   If you have multiple stocks like that, though, it is time to find a new etf or reexamine your own metrics that are giving so many companies a greater valuation."
6/28/2021 16:04,stocks,If you bullish on it and you want more focused exposure to one particular company then Absolutely
6/28/2021 17:07,stocks,"Sure if you like the company and want more exposure to it than wha the ETF gives you. 

I have about a 33/33/33 split in my portfolio between individual stocks, passive ETFs, and active mutual funds. The ETFs and mutual funds all have Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Facebook in them and I still hold the stock of all five individual stocks as well. The dominance they all have in their respective industries is worth an extra investment, imo. Plus, it’s cheaper to hold the stock vs an ETF or mutual fund."
6/28/2021 17:37,stocks,Some ETFs don't pay out dividends so investing in individual stocks in that ETF could give you some dividends while somewhat doubling down on the industry.
6/28/2021 19:17,stocks,It makes sense as long as you consider your overall percentage allocation to that specific company. I do it all the time to increase the weight of a stock I am bullish on.
6/28/2021 16:24,stocks,"Sure if you want more exposure to a specific asset / stock. Just keep in mind that when it tanks you are going down with ETF (only a small tad prob, if even) and your direct allocation."
6/28/2021 17:37,stocks,"Sure. 

You're going to have maybe 3-4% exposure to a given company in an ETF. If you have good reason to believe that a given company would be a worthwhile individual investment and that allocation of the ETF wouldn't match the position that you would take in the company, then by all means set up a larger position.  Whether or not you should account for your position inside the ETF with the portfolio weights is a different matter."
6/28/2021 18:43,stocks,I hold a decent percentage of my portfolio in growth ETF’s while also having positions in AAPL and NVDA so I would say it’s not a bad thing. I just rather good more risky positions for better rewards!
6/28/2021 19:00,stocks,"Yes, if you like the company.

Etfs are much less risk but also much less upside"
6/28/2021 19:37,stocks,If you're high conviction yes
6/28/2021 17:45,stocks,Yes. None of my ETFs are heavy enough in the individual stocks I own. That’s why I own them.
6/28/2021 18:40,stocks,"More risk, more reward. ETFs are nice since they limit your losses when individual stocks tank but they also limit your upside when one of them takes off. If you know and trust the company, get in there."

6/28/2021 16:44,stocks,"right, I've seen that on the NASDAQ website for IPO listings, but I don't see it as being listed on Robinhood.  I suppose I'll just have to wait for the 30th."

6/28/2021 18:15,stocks,Why not? A split up company’s total value in the smaller companies will rise to surpass what one big company would be. Some of us are hoping for AAPL or FB to be split up.

NIO have factory in construction that will be able to build 1million cars per year... backed by China gov, so they gonna push NIO on the over a billion people that live in that damn country... I like NIO future and think that it is technically overvalued but it’s because EV oddly isn’t being valued as car companies , they’re “tech”"
6/28/2021 19:13,stocks,I have 4 shares that I bought about a year ago for 11.50 each. It is the only thing I still have in Robinhood. I personally think there is potential and plan on holding for a long time.
6/28/2021 15:47,stocks,"NIO is more than an EV company. They are also a tech and hospitality company, minimum.

Obviously future growth is partially priced in but I'm bullish on their tech and brand traction in China and Europe. I've been in since $17 and we both know volatility both up and down is nothing new."
6/28/2021 14:53,stocks,The upward trend today could be partially from Tesla’s hiccup with the “recall” in China.
6/28/2021 18:28,stocks,"NIO has a cult following IMO like AAPL. 

I sold NIO at a profit and now I'm betting on Lucid CC/IV + ARVL"
6/28/2021 15:43,stocks,"How I look at it is that NIO is a company similar to Tesla (currently around 688$ a share). I do think Tesla is a bit hyped so let's say half of the current value is not so far-fetched for NIO (340$). Also, take into consideration that the Chinese (Asian) market is quite big and has a lot of potential. My plan is to keep my shares (got in at 37$) for at least the next 2-4 years!"
6/28/2021 16:09,stocks,"Hospitality? Hmm I'm out of the loop on that, and not super informed about the promise of their tech side compared to auto sales.

I believe they'll be a successful car company, but they already have the market cap of a top 10 car company which seems a little bloated for a company with so little sales, even given the upside. Just looked it up, Ford sells more cars per month than Nio had sold in it's lifetime as of Q1 2021. Averages about 20 times the monthly sales of Nio. Taking that into consideration it seems to me that the vast majority of Nio's valuation is about expectation rather than current value, which doesn't suggest a lot of room to run in the near future.

Agree with you about the volatility, and that's not what makes me want to sell. I just think that incredible company growth over the next few years wouldn't make the share price skyrocket, just keep up with it's huge valuation."
6/28/2021 16:26,stocks,Tesla +2.5% today is a hiccup??
6/28/2021 17:46,stocks,Share price alone means nothing. Stop talking bullshit please.
6/28/2021 18:25,stocks,"TSLA is a $600B dollar company that is considered a ""growth"" company. Yes, Tesla is profitable, but it's rich valuation comes from the fact that people think it has a moat in the form of supercharger network, autonomous, battery tech, etc. Nio is in the same position. It's a company that's expected to grow, but guess what? In 3-5 years, when a lot of that manufacturing and sales growth is achieved, what do you think people are going to be saying? That NIO is still a growth company, just like they say about Tesla today... When NIO is $300B, they will say ""Nio is developing this or that to improve autonomous vehicles."" Maybe after full self driving is achieved, they'll work on automating maintenance, or a ""taxi"" network where Nio owners rent out their cars as robotaxis (just like Tesla is supposedly working on). Maybe they'll say they're working on ""a way to charge vehicles in transit using electromagnetic lasers they point at highways.""

The point is, yes, Nio has growth ""priced in"", but the same can be said for Tesla. Both of these companies could work on improving EVs for the next 10 years and still be considered ""growth"" companies. Over the next 10 years, both of these companies (but especially Nio) will come up with some idea to grow the company/industry, they'll start working on it, then investors will say ""hey, this company is going to see massive growth in the next 5-10 years."" The best part about Nio, is that it's still behind in manufacturing/sales, so even if they don't come up with the next big idea, they can still grow to Tesla's size based on manufacturing growth alone, but if Tesla doesn't come up with something new, they'll be stagnant."

In general though I think TTWO seems like it's kind of in that little brother spot in terms of size. EA has twice the market cap and ATVI has almost 4 times their cap so even with the potential explosion of GTA6, it seems unlikely that they will get close to the top dogs. Considering how much cheaper shares are for ATVI and EA (you can almost get 2 for 1 shares from ATVI right now), I think most people just prefer to go with the safer, cheaper, more well-known companies than getting a much smaller position in a much smaller company.

TL;DR: TTWO has room to grow but it's pretty expensive to roll those dice and there is always a chance GTA6 turns into Cyberpunk 2077 and then I'll never be able to retire."

One of the reasons I think it will be SO big is the possibility of drawing in of all the younger Fortnite/Roblox fans who will be old enough to play it by then and also bring back the older GTA fans who will hopefully still be interested. 

If they wait too long, guys my age will be diving into their 30s with a wife and kids etc. and getting out of gaming completely if they haven't already and all the kids who were too young to really care about GTA5 won't really be that interested in 6."
6/28/2021 19:06,stocks,"> EA has twice the market cap and ATVI has almost 4 times their cap

That's what I said. I mentioned the price per share because they are so far apart right now that it could be part of what's having an impact. Typically when you are looking to roll the dice on a smaller company taking on the industry leaders it's much easier to do when it's cheaper."
6/28/2021 14:00,stocks,"What are your holdings?

SP500 does not gain 8-10% annually. That is just an average over an extended period of time.  
The only funds I have are mutual funds, in accounts that do not offer individual stocks. Otherwise I have a small holding of individual stocks. My stocks are performing better in both higher gains and smaller draw downs."
6/28/2021 14:14,stocks,"ETFs are for someone who doesn’t want to keep up managing 30-100 individual tickers.  If you don’t mind keeping up with it yourself then just buy the same stuff they are weighted in and you’ll have similar performance with no fees.  

That being said, the fees for most ETFs aren’t bad (nothing like the mutual fund fees).  I normally have 40-50% in a few ETFs (specifically things I dont personally own)and the rest in individual stocks.  

Be careful investing in ETFs and also owning the same things individually…. You could be doubling your risk profile and not know it."
6/28/2021 14:06,stocks,"Depends solely on your risk profile. 

I'm young, don't have a lot to loose, if I loose it's really not a game changer - not even on 100% as I'm not at all dependent on my current savings (minus a smaller safety buffer, for the feels) ... 

That's also why I'm investing more and more directly in potential game changers rather than some ETF yielding 3-10% annually. 

If you're 65+, looking for a relaxed pension ... that view might be different. 

I`m in my early thirties, a (few) 10+ bagger would make a change, loosing a few k ... honestly doesn't change things, so my risk appetite is more on the upper end."

6/28/2021 18:21,stocks,"The one thing that etf have on their side is the tax advantage. That advantage being you don’t have to sell the shares until you need start drawing down. If you hold individual stocks you will probably want to rotate that capital into another company before you ever need to actually use the capital for retirement or whatever. When you rotate that capital from one stock to another in a regular brokerage you trigger capital gains tax. So if you are selling a holding without holding more than a year, uncle Sam takes a nice chunk of your gains."

the trouble with your list of stocks is that it's very heavily into tech and trendy/hot stocks (too much EV exposure IMO). in reality, boring stable companies are usually better investments. trend-chasing can backfire. the top performing stocks of the last 20 years include boring names like Monster Beverage, Tractor Supply and Ross Dress for Less. https://howmuch.net/articles/best-performing-stocks"

6/28/2021 14:21,stocks,"When inflation goes up, FED counters this with the rise in interest rates. Businesses will have to spend more money to pay interests and debts which means they can’t spend as much money for things like R&D. 

Inflation heavily affects growth stocks. As we know, growth companies’ valuations come from the people’s expectation of them making free cash flow in the future. But when inflation strenghtens, those future cash flows will be worth less. 

This makes people to transition to companies with strong dividends, since they want the cash flow now when it’s worth more than it’d be worth in the future."
6/28/2021 13:54,stocks,Stuff gets expensive. Interest rates go up. Poor people have it worse than now. Everyone except the super wealthy have it worse than now. Life goes on.

6/28/2021 14:21,stocks,"Right. So super wealthy people don’t sell things - they borrow against them so they don’t have to pay taxes on the cash. If inflation rises, that cash become cheaper. Is that what we’re talking about?

The flip side is that future cash will be more expensive because interest rates will climb with inflation."
6/28/2021 14:06,stocks,"So (??) interest rates matter because if they go up, some percentage of people will pull money from markets and just put it into bonds. I guess dividend stocks would suffer especially(?). 

I hadn’t thought about the real estate aspect. Anyone with a loan will find that loan to be cheaper by the minute. Anyone with an existing loan is happy and anyone buying a new house is fornicated…."

Idk how long they'll sell for or how much they own, but they bought something like 70% of the company back in 2017. I'm sure that they're just making returns on their investment at this point. other large minority holders are buying, by what I can tell"
6/28/2021 14:15,stocks,"If I worked at a company that just IPO'd, I'd sell a good portion of my shares as soon as I was able to diversify."
6/28/2021 13:43,stocks,They could be given stock in lieu of salary and sell if need or they want to. You should look into that first  before  making an assumption.
6/28/2021 14:17,stocks,They were purchased by eagle tree which is a PE firm a few years ago and they have been doing the majority of selling.  Not surprising IMO.
6/28/2021 14:53,stocks,"Most of the insider trading you see is from EagleTree. They are a private equity firm that owns the majority stake in the company. ET purchased CRSR in 2017 as part of their IV fund.

There are lots of theories as to what ET will do. I think the only known is that we have no idea. Some say they will keep at least a 50% stake to maintain control. Others say 10%. Which I believe has to do with keeping someone on the board. My theory is that they completely close the position over time. It's my understanding that PE firms take a company public as a lesser executed exit strategy. It has nothing to do with their long-term opinion of the company and more to do with their business model. I am still seeking answers on this subject. So take it with a grain of salt and feel free to chime in.

My understanding is if ET sells down to an amount that causes them to lose control of CRSR, this will make the company more attractive to institutional investors. Also, as the shares ET holds becomes less, sell-offs should have less of an effect on the price due to the increase in float.

I have a post asking for info about this topic. Also, there are lots of discussions on r/CRSR that may help."
6/28/2021 13:55,stocks,Insider selling is rarely meaningful. Insiders are given stock for free as part of their compensation. They sell because they want to buy something else. It doesn't mean they are not bullish on their own company... especially if the amount they sell is only partial to their overall holdings.
6/28/2021 16:50,stocks,"Peter Lynch made a great point on this topic. ""Insider selling is done for numerous reasons, not all bad long term outlook on the company. However, there is only 1 reason for insider buying; that is what you should truly be focusing"". I'm quoting off memory so forgive me if I was off a bit"
6/28/2021 15:34,stocks,"When a company offers share in an IPO, there is typically a lockup period in which the owners of shares that were issued in the offering are restricted from selling. Once the restrictions end, those insiders may more freely sell their shares (which isn't to say that they are free from any restrictions on selling), and so it's not uncommon to see insiders selling at this point.

This makes it less useful to look at ""insider selling"" as a bearish signal in cases like these. In many cases, the individuals & entities who are selling still own significant numbers of shares, and so their actions don't always indicate that anything is wrong with the company, but that they are personally diversifying or cashing out some of their holdings when the opportunity first arises."
6/28/2021 16:28,stocks,Generally insider selling can mean so many different things that you can’t count on it as a bad thing unless quite many are doing it. Insider buying however can only mean one thing (a good thing).

6/28/2021 15:02,stocks,">VOO, VOOG, VOOV, VXUS, VTI, BND

there's a lot of overlap in those funds. so I'd consolidate. 

VTI is literally all the stocks listed on the major US market exchanges, so it includes everything listed in the other US ETFs

VOO is the S&P 500, so 500 company stocks mostly larger companies with a bit of mid-size stock. 

VOOG is the S&P 500 *growth* index, the section of the S&P 500 companies that are growing faster than average for their type. so VOO has all the stocks in VOOG. 

VOOV is the S&P 500 *value* index, the section of the S&P 500 with the stocks are 'on sale' and don't reflect their true value (like buying a $10,000 car for $6,000).  So VOO has all the stocks in VOOV

VXUS has most major stocks worldwide, except for the United States. this is a good companion to VOO or VTI

BND is bonds, not stocks, so it's potentially more stable but usually not recommended for a young investor unless they're very risk-averse."

6/28/2021 13:12,stocks,"Sounds like you're talking about short-term gains, which are taxed differently that long-term gains.

Short term gains (investments held less than a year) mean you have to pay ordinary income tax on those gains... which depends on your tax bracket, but usually about 25% is assumed.

If you hold an investment for over a year, then you only have to pay long term capital gains of 15%.

If you ""cash out"" that account at the end of the year, you'll be paying short-term gains at your ordinary tax rate based on ""where you end"". If you have a loss, then you'll get to deduct $3,000 every year until the total loss is written off. So if you lose $1,500, you'll write off $1,500, but if you lose $6,000, you'll write off $3000 this year and $3000 next year.

If you hold these investments for 366 days or more, then the same rules apply, but you'll only pay 15% tax on the gains.

Wash sales IMO aren't a huge problem unless you're playing with options. If you day trade options and have enough wash sales, it is possible to pay taxes on a loss... which is a real bitch IMO. Just don't day trade (buy and sell within 30 days) options unless you really do a lot of research and know what you're doing with these."
6/28/2021 15:13,stocks,"I recommend you talk to a local CPA, preferably also an ""Enrolled Agent"". 

the CPA who does our taxes says he's seeing lots of young Robinhood traders with very complex tax problems,  things that he rarely had to deal with a decade ago. people on Robinhood can get in over their heads very fast. he had a client who profited only a few hundred bucks over the year, but it was a nightmare to enter dozens of tax forms for a series of $10 trades

I started doing my taxes the past couple of years, so I am not looking forward to attempting to figure this out..."
6/28/2021 16:34,stocks,"Thanks! Yeah, I saw the wash sale column on the brokerage paperwork when I did my taxes last year, but it was such an insignificant amount.  I was worried that scaling up would hurt me though.  Did you do your own taxes?"
6/28/2021 16:40,stocks,"Did you have a lot of losses? That's really the only time you have to worry about wash sales. I did my own taxes. It was pretty straightforward and idiot proof, but I didn't have other complicating factors. Basic stock trades and pretty easy to fill out the forms."
6/28/2021 16:49,stocks,"No, I did not have much loss last tax period.  I probably broke even, or was very close on one side or the other (again, was only playing with $1,500).  I bought and sold individual stocks, but did no day trading and held most for weeks to months at a time.  And I agree, that it at least seemed pretty straightforward unless I was doing something wrong... I was basically just pulling already calculated numbers off of the tax paperwork from the brokerage accounts, which were organized and summarized, and entering them into the tax forms.  I was hoping with my MUCH more frequent trading this year it would be similarly simple, but I wasn't sure.  Mainly I wanted to verify that I wasn't setting myself up for some major pitfal with the daily trading.  Especially when it is just for fun, and my gains, at best, will be $1k if my luck continues."
6/28/2021 17:17,stocks,"For wash sales to start to mess you up, you have to be trading within the 30 day timeframe, and you have to be losing and expecting those losses to cancel out your gains. Otherwise, you have nothing special to worry about. It's only an issue if you were counting on losses to cancel gains.

Short term trades get added onto your regular income and taxed accordingly. I traded a lot in a brokerage account in 2020 and early 2021 and have no issues, even when doing  alot of day and swing trades.

For the past few months I've been mostly trading in an IRA & a Roth. No need to file any tax forms for that."

6/28/2021 12:55,stocks,"Withdrawing money from a brokerage account is not a taxable event. 

The government doesn't track this stuff, your broker does. They should provide you with any necessary forms/data for you to complete your taxes accurately. They also provide the same data to the IRS. It is still a good idea to get a basic understanding of how it all works since you're ultimately responsible for any errors.

Your understanding of the process is accurate, but the terminology is a bit off. For tax purposes, your initial investment will be called your cost basis, not contribution. When you sell, your cost basis is deducted from the sale price to arrive at your gain or loss, so it is not taxable."

6/28/2021 12:48,stocks,"you had to be in before the news, then sell on the news"
6/28/2021 12:50,stocks,"Thanks for this, I realized that the order wouldn't execute until open, but I just wasn't sure why the opening price was so much higher than friday's close; e.g. I figured there would be a rapid rise, but I would at least catch some upside. How much of a delay is there between actual open and when a retailer's buy order goes through, in your experience?"
6/28/2021 12:51,stocks,"So I thought this was the case too, but I have read online that after/pre hours trading is possible for retail investors, but wasn't sure how."
6/28/2021 12:52,stocks,"ya, but I'm assuming some folks bought on the news slightly ahead of others, and then sold before the news peak was done. e.g. traders that read the news Monday morning vs those who caught it over the weekend and placed a buy order, but I guess that was wishful thinking."
6/28/2021 13:18,stocks,"It looks like a decent rise when ur watching premarket. And u fomo. Or I did. Its not so much the minutes that matter, its that it ALWAYS drops between 9:30 -10:00 when everybody aftermarkets get dealt with (heavy volume) so the price at 9am and the one you hit at 9:32 are different. I try to hit morning buys between 9:45-10. And only go 50% in case it dips a little bit more. And I'm definitely not an educated trader, this is just my personal experience learned in the school of ""well fuck me then""."
6/28/2021 13:03,stocks,"oh you absolutely can. but you won't get in before the large spike because that movement is done by large blocks of trading by institutions

pre/post market trading is notoriously illiquid which means it has super wide spreads which is why retail trading is generally not done. if you think you can profit it by it though, go ahead. just know it's very different from market hours"
6/28/2021 16:25,stocks,"The people who caught this move owned the stock at Friday's close. It opened \~50% higher, so anyone who didn't already own it on Friday was too late."
6/28/2021 18:16,stocks,"I think where you’re getting confused is, people don’t actually have to buy or sell for the price to move. It can jump 40% over the weekend with no buys or sells occurring. The new asks and bids at open set the price."
6/28/2021 13:54,stocks,"TBH, I wasn't even watching premarket- I read the article on saturday and knew it was going to pop on monday and so scheduled the buy. Its not so much that the price dropped after I bought it, its that the spike happened before my order got routed. 

p.s. do you have a recommendation on a good place to view after-hours/pre-market activity?"
6/28/2021 13:57,stocks,"ah thanks, I think this is part of the answer I was looking for- not all orders are treated as equal at open.

on the actual pre/post market, how does one actually execute trades? is it a function of whether your brokerage offers the option? I'm on SoFi and there isn't an option to trade after hours- only to slate orders for the next time the market is open."
6/28/2021 14:41,stocks,"It doesn't work that way just on TRCH. Just about everything has went that way for me. I don't get complicated with watching and super-analysing because so much of this stuff is purely market driven and unpredictable. It has also been my experience that folks act like their hindsight is skill. They look back and if it goes up and they thought it was going to they call victory and just don't count all the times they were wrong. With any of these penny stocks or meme stocks, it's mostly luck and popularity. Just being honest."
6/28/2021 14:15,stocks,"the pre/post market functions exactly as regular market. one side buys and one side sells. the issue there is there's a lot less volume so you might not get filled for the price you want (if you market order) or your limit order may never fill. in addition, it's a lot more volatile because of this (you can see spy at -1% in premarket but then go to +1% by market open)

yes, your brokerage needs to offer pre/post trading to actually do it"
6/28/2021 14:54,stocks,Not sure I follow? NTLA is neither a penny nor a meme stock. (Maybe you thought when I wrote TBH above I meant TRCH? TBH= To be honest)
6/28/2021 15:46,stocks,TRCH on the brain. It's been a long week on the TRCH train. Lol. My bad. I've been giving guidance to folks confused and freaking out about the TRCH/MMAT merger. Sorry.

6/28/2021 13:22,stocks,"The valuation for SQ right now is fine - it’s not low obviously but it’s fine. In 2 years this will seem like a bargain.

The company is incredibly well positioned for the next decade."

Edit: $73 not $93"
6/28/2021 12:35,stocks,"I am a little nervous adding at these levels, but I see it doing well going forward."
6/28/2021 19:00,stocks,"Love all the bearish takes in here that haven't got a clue about SQ. They've barely scratched the surface in terms of closed loop transactions between their seller clients and cash app users. Not to mention Cash app hasn't launched internationally yet(and it will, they're already hiring cash app leads in Europe).

I buy as much as I can on pull backs."

I personally thought it was a really bad decision and I soon after closed my position in SQ as I thought it was very overvalued and the company was beginning to make decisions that I didn’t feel confident with (not a big fan of the bitcoin saga as I don’t support crypto). I essentially lost conviction in the stock and took my profits elsewhere. 

Anyone else’s thoughts?"

6/28/2021 19:07,stocks,Ah! I sold it 😭😭

6/28/2021 19:35,stocks,I yolo'd my webull (play/gambling) acct into SQ at $276 because some analyst somewhere said the new PT was $335....
6/28/2021 19:35,stocks,"I like Square as a business, but think the valuation is crazy. Most of their revenue growth over the past year or two is crypto related, very low margin, and subject to regulatory uncertainty. 

That crypto business should be valued at a significant value to the rest of the business, which is really solid."
6/28/2021 19:42,stocks,"Yup, In at $26 from 2017. Still holding.  It’s valuation seems inflated to me."

6/28/2021 17:51,stocks,"I own a couple shares and think buying Tidal was a terrible idea. Not only is it completely unrelated to their core business, but also Tidal offers no real advantage compared to Apple and Spotify. All they got to do is add high quality audio, which they will do/are doing, and the one thing that was meant to be unique to Tidal is now available to anyone (btw, not many people care about lossless audio anyway).

Didn't sell my shares though. Just hope they won't go on buying other irrelevant businesses..."

6/28/2021 18:45,stocks,"Not sure about the tesla bit. But definitely bullish on Sq. 5 Jan 270c and 200 shares. Innovative company growing stupidly fast. Incumbent banks are scared of them and for good reason.  Speaking of which, they got their bank charter this year. That leaves massive new growth opportunities"
6/28/2021 17:11,stocks,Never say never
6/28/2021 13:56,stocks,It was there not even too long ago lol. Any sort of correction can very well bring SQ to those ranges lol.
6/28/2021 18:53,stocks,said every reddit investor ever lmfao. your probably right though we will likely never see these prices again.
6/28/2021 19:53,stocks,Battery running flat on that analogy?
6/28/2021 19:41,stocks,Never
6/28/2021 14:33,stocks,Just like any other tech play - you may have to wait but absolutely it will hit those levels again - I like SQ but it's too rich for me at these levels.
6/28/2021 15:38,stocks,"If anything the price will stagnate and revenue multiples will compress over time.

You won’t see the price go down to $190 though. That’s my take."
6/28/2021 17:12,stocks,"In March of 2020, I was getting notifications for price triggers that I'd set 7-8 years prior and forgotten about. One thing I've learned is to never, ever say never."
6/28/2021 16:03,stocks,"Fair enough - I really like SQ though. I think it may overtake PayPal at some point. 

Evaluation on tech is so difficult at this point though, and as an investor so much future growth is already priced in to where there’s not enough upside and too much risk of downside 

Like I said, I love square and everyone who I know that uses their products love them but I don’t think the current 240 stock price has the value that I’m after."
6/28/2021 17:37,stocks, I know $190 is also a stretch but I would not be surprised to see a drop to 200.
6/28/2021 18:18,stocks,I agree. Some high growth names can stay flat for years and all of a sudden their valuation is attractive
6/28/2021 17:16,stocks,"I own PYPL and I've contemplated buying SQ on about 50 occasions, but PayPal has so much more diversity of service right now. Commercial, peer to peer (Venmo) and international (Xoom). I love Square's focus on small biz though, so I might add on a dip somewhere."
6/28/2021 13:45,stocks,Last I checked folks figured out most of the info on this companies statistics are bogus.  Looks undervalued but is actually fair value.
6/28/2021 0:00,stocks,UGL as a Potential Hedge Has anyone dabbled with UGL? It is a leveraged golf etf. Only thinking of adding 1-2%. I feel as if it is a better hedge than bear etfs. I do like the VIX better as of now but exploring options still. At least gold is somewhat asymmetric.
6/28/2021 0:00,stocks,"Advice for my situation So I brought into a mid-cap etf in the beginning of May at an ATH. I’ve invested a majority of my savings and decided to just auto purchase shares every week and forget it for years to come. 

I’m also planning to need about 1/3rd of my portfolio to move in October, so ideally I would want to have the cash free by end of August/September. I had this in mind and figured I’d just invest it until I need that portion. Right now I’m down about 3% and put an order in to sell what I need once it reaches a slight profit. I just worry that the time is ticking and I shouldn’t have put that chunk of money if I needed it in a few months. I also don’t want to rush it and then I miss out on profits.

What would you guys do in this situation? Wait for my order to fill by august or actively watch each day and try and sell close to a profit or be even? I’ve also been averaging down every week.

Thanks in advance!"
6/28/2021 11:33,stocks,"Stop investing weekly. Put that money towards what you need in October. If its not enough sell what you need to sell in september or now, doesn't really matter"
6/28/2021 11:16,stocks,"If you need the money you can take that back even if it means a 3% loss, if it's a good investment you'll make that back over time anyway."
6/28/2021 12:59,stocks,"Agree with u/SaintRainbow Stop your weekly auto purchase and start putting that aside for the money you need in October.

Also, not sure what you'll consider slight profit but don't forget you'll have to pay short-term capital gains tax on your profit."

6/28/2021 13:13,stocks,Thanks! I mean it’s mainly patience and I seriously doubt there would be a life changing market crash between then and now.

6/28/2021 0:00,stocks,"Is this a run up to Q2 earnings season? I’m going to be receiving a decent bonus check later this week (~$5,000) and to preface, I’m aware of “time in the market” > timing the market. But is anyone thinking that August/September would be a better time to sink some cash into the market? Just feels like all these recent highs are a run up to Q2 earnings."
6/28/2021 16:43,stocks,September/October are historically bad months but if we melt up then pull back you could lose upside. What I like to do with new chunks of money is spread it out over time to get the best price. Plus if earnings season is like the last quarter you will have plenty of “ Sell the news “ stocks to invest in.
6/28/2021 11:35,stocks,"Agree, I also think it's a result of the COVID restrictions ending in the last few weeks."
6/28/2021 16:50,stocks,"I think you’re on to something. No one can be certain of course, but I have been buying the recent pull backs in the sectors/areas that align with the position/view I’ve already established (ie: metals, mining companies).

My thoughts with this are:

China tapping in to national reserves of metals/minerals temporarily alleviating supply-demand dynamics; Federal Reserve reverse repo operations reducing money supply in circulation creating downward pressure on all asset prices (theoretically speaking, less $ chasing flat # of available assets with flat demand = lower asset prices); Ongoing covid mutations/variants are and will further constrain already constrained supply chains; Fiscal policy initiatives and spending by multiple governments (US already) will target infrastructure development and lead to significant upward pressure on demand for metals/minerals, increasing prices as supply levels are forecasted short through 2025/2030/2040.

Buy/sell if it aligns with your view. Don’t buy/don’t sell if it aligns with your view. Personally speaking, it took me a while to understand that I have to take my view to find out if my view is correct."
6/28/2021 14:39,stocks,"Invest it as soon as you can. There is no use trying to outsmart the market and wait. For all you know, earnings season could be a blowout and the market could continue moving up."

That being said, we have had a UGE run up. We might be in for somewhat of a consolidation period. Long term tho, this will be a fantastic company. I think they reach the trillion dollar club way quicker than most anticipate. If ARM actually goes through, look out, this thing will keep rocketing."

6/28/2021 10:54,stocks,B U L L I S H
6/28/2021 11:32,stocks,"Copying and pasting from an earlier conversation I had today:

Nvidia has a few CMP HX partner models preparing to launch - these are the mining specific cards. They have no display output which means they can't be used for gaming. Nvidia is also revising ALL current 30 series (except 3090 I believe) to a LHR (light hash rate) version which is a physical difference in the silicon. They are doing this to nerf ETH mining performance on their 30 series cards at the hardware level.

Currently, Nvidia's CMP HX mining cards make no economic sense to mine on since they are way less power efficient, and have no resale value since they can't be used for gaming. However, if Nvidia completely locks down ETH hash rate on the 30 series, they can increase their TAM by preventing miners from cannibalizing their gaming sales. So far, the CMP HX cards look like they are built on 10 series architecture so they will be able to be produced cheaper and in parallel to 30 series.

Lastly, the ARM deal seems to be moving along. Qualcomm has voiced concerns and said they are ready to invest in ARM as a partner if the Nvidia deal falls through. Nvidia says it has 3 other silicon manufacturers who support the Nvidia deal but details aren't known yet. Nvidia's recent rise is likely due to the probability of the ARM deal actually becoming more likely.

In case you dont understand why the ARM deal is good for NVDA, it means that all ARM-based chip manufacturers are beholden to NVDA. ARM is the most dominant CPU architecture for all mobile CPUs including micro controllers in other devices. Apple, qualcomm, samsung, amd, intel, huawei, IBM all have ARM licenses

It allows NVDA to penetrate the mobile market. Nvidia has the highest profit margins on their mobile CPUs because they don't have to rely on partners to distribute chunky desktop cards. They sell the silicon directly. Every iphone and samsung galaxy could have an Nvidia-produced CPU and GPU.

The reason ARM is used for mobile is because of its power efficiency. If Nvidia knows what they are doing (they do) then they know how they can use their proprietary access to ARM to create ultra performant and efficient server chips, feeding into their datacenter revenue.

Nvidia has announced plans to enter the server CPU market. When they announced this, Intel and AMD stock tanked 5% or so. My bet is that they are already working with ARM to deliver their CPU server chips

TL;DR - ARM deal going through would make NVDA pull a page out of 2020 TSLA's book. Downside is ARM deal delays, pricing in approval then having it get denied. Would crush the stock."
6/28/2021 10:50,stocks,Loving it. Will bring in more investors.
6/28/2021 11:19,stocks,Buy before
6/28/2021 12:07,stocks,"Fundamentals are a little expensive right now. Their growth could justify it. My recommendation would be buy in if you have none, but wait to add if you already hold some."
6/28/2021 15:20,stocks,"IMO, price will go down after the split from people taking profit. But possibility of new support being 800 (200 after split)."
6/28/2021 15:09,stocks,"Stock splits on big tech trigger large runs.

AAPL went on a 35% run last year from announcement date to the acutal split(20ish days), TSLA went on a 60% run(1 month), TTD has run 36% in the last 3 weeks since it announced. So far NVDA has run 15% with 3 more weeks until the actual split. With additional good news/rumors surrounding the ARM deal it will keep running imo.

They are a solid long term investment anyways, innovative tech with many new applications on the horizon they will continue to grow organically for years to come."

Nvidia is such a good fucking stock. It was my largest holding and im so happy I was right. I mean they have so much going on for them... their GPUs will sell as many as they can produce, and the need for them will only increase as AI, self driving cars, and cloud gaming continue to take off. Plus AI can play a bit part in predicting lots of cool things, like how a virus might mutate, for example, which is going to become increasingly important. And as far as I know, Nvidia's AI department is ahead of the game. What a no brainer stock, I'm up more than 50% on it and that's after rebuying after like 30% gains"

While the intrinsic value of the stock is not changed by a forward split, ive noticed that sometimes investor excitement often drives the stock price up after the split is announced.

NVDA is already worth $500 billion. TSLA is $666 billion. Yeah, there’s a little more upward movement needed for NVDA to match Tesla’s valuation, but it’s not like NVDA can turn in a 2021 or 2022 like Tesla’s 2020 was."

6/28/2021 13:41,stocks,"Here’s an idea. Come up with a list of sectors that make sense to you. Let’s say (for me) it might be tech, healthcare, banking, real estate and retailers. Think about things that are diverse and yet you interact with them in some way. We all go to Walmart & target, right? There are “official” sectors out there - you could choose from those. Making up your own might be more fun though

Now, split your money between those sectors. Doesn’t have to be equal - you can be “overweight” in a sector if you want. That’s the essence of rotation - if you feel tech has ended it’s tear, and it’s time for retail to take off, put more in retail than tech 

Now, in each of your sectors choose two companies. I like number 1 and an aggressive challenger, but you could look for an undervalued player, a fast follower, clear leader, etc. that gives you that fun of picking winners - at the same time as reducing the risk be peanut-buttering your money

Upside? Diversification should make you a lot less susceptible to sudden moves within a sector

Downside? If you screw up the weighting, growth j  one sector will be offset by a loss in another

This isn’t “set and forget”, though. If you do have the sector winner as one of your picks, that won’t change that often, but sometimes second place or undervalued player can change over time

Full disclosure - I had a system like this at one point, but got bored with the upkeep and also felt I wasn’t really beating some of the broader funds so I switched to “set and forget” with a few fidelity funds - mainly focused on small / mid caps"

6/28/2021 0:00,stocks,"Looking for some gold stocks to invest in Because of the pandemic (and being inside my house for so long), I started researching stocks, which made me want to invest to diversify my holdings. I thought of investing in some mining company stocks, specifically gold.

I came across some that really piqued my interest:

Collective Mining ([CNL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CNL.V/))

* They are the team from Continental Gold, who is constructing the largest gold mining in Colombia before selling it to Zijin Mining. 
* They have promising projects like the [exploration in San Antonio and Guayabales](https://collectivemining.com/projects/), which shows
* Recently they just had [a blockbuster IPO that saw the stock pop 205% on the first day of trading](https://miningfeeds.com/2021/05/31/collective-mining-tsxvcnl-pops-205-on-the-first-day-of-trading/).

Kirkland Lake Gold ([KL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/KL/))

* They have mines in Canada and Australia. I think they still have upside to them tbh. With their recent development projects boarding detour, I believe they will just continue to grow.
* Their management has improved, and their revenue growth is improving even more.
* They have a nice dividend, and imo they are among Canada’s best gold miners. They recently introduced the [Automatic Share Purchase Plan](https://www.kl.gold/news-and-media/press-release-details/2021/Kirkland-Lake-Gold-Introduces-Automatic-Share-Purchase-Plan/default.aspx)

Newmont Corporation ([NEM](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NEM/))

* They basically have the largest gold reserve base in the industry. They have gold mines in has ownership of gold mines in Nevada, Colorado, Ontario, Quebec, Mexico, the Dominican Republic, Australia, Ghana, Argentina, Peru, and Suriname.
* They recently [acquired GT Gold](https://www.newmont.com/investors/news-release/news-details/2021/Newmont-Completes-Acquisition-of-GT-Gold/default.aspx) too, which only made them even more profitable. This development improved their portfolio significantly, since GT Gold has the Tatogga project in the highly sought after Golden Triangle District of British Columbia, Canada.

Those are just a few. But if anyone has investing advice or insight, I would really appreciate it. Thank you!"

6/28/2021 18:49,stocks,"Kinross is one of my top holdings in general. 

Production in 2020 2.4 million oz
Cash $934M
FCF $726M
Debt $1.95B
AISC $970
Market Cap 8B
Gold reserves: 24.3M oz or 10 yr reserves at current production 

Production expectations by year:
2020 2.4M
2021 2.4M
2022 2.7M
2023 2.9M
2024 2.4M
Total 5 year gold production expectations 12.8M oz

If gold stays around $1700oz with an AISC of $970 KGC should profit about $730/oz. $730oz x 12.8m oz is about $9.3 billion in profit. In other words you get your money back if less than 5 years if gold stays at current prices and they hit their production expectations. 

I generally like the company because they have low levels of debt, stable free cash flow, trading at a low PE, 10+ years of known reserves which is a big issue in the industry as few discoveries have been made recently,  and they have a number of mines mostly in low politics risk areas."

Others have recommended actually buying some metal and bringing it to your house, maybe under your bed or buried in the backyard. I don't know how much they are joking, but in case you want to invest in the price of gold itself and skip the shovel work, you can buy the price of gold with an ETF without having to do the physical stuff and guarding it with a shotgun.

SGOL and a few others tracks the price of gold  
[https://www.aberdeenstandard.com/en-us/us/investor/fund-details/aberdeen-standard-physical-gold-shares-etf/common-stock/us00326a1043](https://www.aberdeenstandard.com/en-us/us/investor/fund-details/aberdeen-standard-physical-gold-shares-etf/common-stock/us00326a1043)

That price is going to be the same as owning gold, minus the headaches. The expense ratio is 0.17%, likely cheaper than buying a shotgun and building a security perimeter around your home.

Joking aside, you also get the typical conveniences of investing with an ETF: enter and exit at will with a few clicks, buy in fractions instead in gold bars, etc.

Aberdeen Standard also has convenient ETFs for other metals. You can do SIVR for silver, or GLTR that combines 4 metals in a convenient basket."

[this link](https://topforeignstocks.com/2019/09/26/gold-vs-sp-500-long-term-returns-chart/) is a little old but shows the prices over the some time. The great thing with gold is if you are dealing with a large amount of money, gold offers protection from a potential crash and could then be used to open new positions during a crash whilst having also profited from the gold rush. For normal investors, I agree it probably won't pay off. But it's not necessarily a bad investment just an option that offers something different."

6/28/2021 12:15,stocks,"So the appeal to gold stocks is the margin between the all in sustaining cost and the sell price. You are investing in an asset that creates wealth via a business instead of gold that is just a hedge. Plus, if gold goes up their margins get wider for every single ounce they sell. To me personally, a business is always more attractive than a commodity/currency (whatever you want to call it).  I know this is probably the most skewed example, but I remember Buffett talking about how gold and BRK were once the same price.  Gold is 2000$, BRK is 400,000. It’s an extreme example but it just shows but buying and holding the right company can do"

6/28/2021 14:08,stocks,Gold is primarily a store of value. But you can calculate an easy 2% yearly due to inflation. If there's a stockmarket crash (like we saw in 2020) fear rose and the value of gold exploded. Compared to the 01 lows you got a decent 400% RoI

6/28/2021 13:06,stocks,It’s not at all. Gold ETFs aren’t backed with the gold you buy most of the time. It’s much safer and tbh much more fun to buy a gold coin or bar and be able to hold it in your hands. I see no reason why you should risk your money in an ETF

6/28/2021 10:43,stocks,They were at pre-pandemic levels just a few months ago with share dilution accounted for. Their debt levels are so high I am not going near them at these prices.
6/28/2021 11:21,stocks,Yes they will absolutely survive until November.  No they will not recover to pre-pandemic highs anytime soon.  The main reason for this was share dilution.  To make sure they did not go bankrupt all of the major cruise companies issued new shares to raise money to pay for operating expenses while revenue was not coming in.  This diluted the value of existing shares.  I don't know specifically for NCLH but I believe all cruise lines were between 20%-40% diluted meaning being down 20%-40% is the same as the pre-pandemic highs because one share is a smaller part of the company now.  I also think that NCLH was the one that diluted the most but I am not sure.

Beyond that, every cabin is an isolation room, so it really depends on what level of competency their medical staff has, and how much equipment the CDC (or equivalent agency) requires them to carry. 

I don't see patient care as the big issue, it's what will the fallout be from the next ""plague ship"" event. It will happen, I see a fair overlap between the cruise junkie and antivax/antimask communities so in my mind it's not so much a matter of if, but when."

(NASDAQ: ETSY), which operates two-sided online marketplaces that connect millions of passionate and creative buyers and sellers around the world, has signed a definitive agreement to acquire Elo7, a privately held marketplace for unique, handmade items, ranked as a top 10 ecommerce site in Brazil. Etsy will acquire the business for US$217 million in cash, subject to certain adjustments for Elo7's working capital, transaction expenses, cash and indebtedness, and reduced by the value of certain equity awards of Etsy to be granted to Elo7 employees in connection with the transaction. Following the closing of the transaction, Elo7 will continue to be headquartered in Sāo Paulo, Brazil and operate as a standalone marketplace run by its existing leadership team.

Considered a leader in 'custom and made-to-order' merchandise in Brazil with strong local brand awareness, the Elo7 marketplace connects approximately 1.9 million active buyers with approximately 56,000 active sellers and currently has approximately 8 million items for sale, the majority of which are made to order. Elo7's marketplace includes items from over 40 retail categories, with more than 50% of gross merchandise sales (GMS) from ""special event and life moment"" categories such as wedding, baby, home decor, and children's parties.

Josh Silverman, Etsy, Inc. CEO, commented, ""Elo7 is the 'Etsy of Brazil,' with a purpose and business model similar to our own. Following our recent agreement to purchase Depop, we're excited to bring another unique marketplace into the Etsy family. This transaction will establish a foothold for us in Latin America, an underpenetrated ecommerce region where Etsy currently does not have a meaningful customer base. We look forward to welcoming Elo7's talented leadership team and employees to the Etsy family.""

6/28/2021 0:00,stocks,"Morning Update for Monday, 06/28/21 Good morning everyone! I hope you had a nice weekend and were able to take some time to relax. 

*This list is geared towards day trading. With the momentum watchlist especially, I am typically in and out very quickly, only occasionally longer than a couple minutes, usually faster scalps.* Always have a plan when you enter a trade (for profit taking and for taking a loss), and use proper risk management for your account.

**Main Watchlist:**

Gapping UP:

* NTLA: Massive gap up, worth keeping an eye on for further movement. Possible premarket support at 135. 
* CRSP: Possible support around 150. I'll be watching how things look closer to open, but should be seeing high volume today.  
* SPCE: Worth keeping an eye on for further momentum after the big day on Friday. 
* LI: Potential resistance on the daily chart around 34. 
* AVXL: Seeing strong volume and price action in premarket, worth keeping an eye on for further momentum. Seeing lots of volatility, just make sure not to chase trades. 

Gapping DOWN:

* BA: Potential support level right around 245. Could retract to 240 if it drops below 244. 
* CCL:  Gapping down below SMA(50). Potential support level at 27. 
* MOXC: Could retrace down to the 16 level, particularly if it can't get back above 20. 

**Market Outlook:**

Stocks are looking at a mixed open, after finishing off last week on a strong note. SPY is trading a bit under 427, with the potential to set new ATH once again. DIA is trading right around 344, hovering right around that support/resistance level. Tech stocks are showing some strength, with QQQ trading a bit over 350. Gold, silver, and crude oil are all slightly down at the moment. EV stocks are somewhat mixed this morning. 

Some important news came out regarding CRISPR technology this weekend, so gene-editing stocks will be a hot topic today and likely throughout the week. Worth keeping an eye on NTLA, CRSP, BEAM, EDIT, etc.

Remember to use proper risk management, by making sure you size appropriately for your account and have a plan for every trade you enter (both for taking profits and cutting losses). Happy trading everyone :)"

We’re not talking marginally here, we’re taking billions and billions."

6/28/2021 18:15,stocks,"Yea the valuation is high, that's all reasonable points.

This company is one of the few that are heavily informed by my own work experience. Bought it on a ""good company in a growing sector"" principle. The valuation was rich for my taste so I ended up buying less than I wanted to originally. In my own opinion though I didn't think the valuation would drop that much so I got in at a price close to IPO and plan to sit on it for a few years."
6/28/2021 18:09,stocks,"It totally is a bandaid.

But the problem is that alot of small and medium sized companies who are looking for automation/AI wins 
1) can't afford a real digital transformation
2) don't have the will/ champion to do a real organization wide digital transformation
3) alot of tech companies are still run by older management who don't really understand the technology they're peddling and just know that they need AI and automation to ""stay competitive""
4) even if every company decided today to do a digital transformation that's a 3 year process at least for a mid sized company, that's alot of revenue in the meantime for RPA to score



Therefore there's still alot of room for the industry to grow. I used to do digital consulting for a large Telco and that company was a mess internally. RPA was one of the most cost effective ways and measurable ways to do a ""digital transformation"". Long term I think it's crap and can be and should be replaced. But nobody wants to stick their neck out. There's a good 3-5 year run before I think RPA's momentum slows down."
6/28/2021 6:58,stocks,I think Cathy Wood record is good now in the last year or two. you should wait to see if she can beat the maker over long term
6/28/2021 8:13,stocks,Would this be said about Buffet in 90's ? lets wait 30 years and see what he does
6/28/2021 8:29,stocks,No it wouldn't because he invest in company fundamentals rather than future prospects. Very different
6/28/2021 14:16,stocks,"We don't have to wait 30 years. We can look at Kathy's track record, it's no secret. She starts up very risky ETFs targeting disruptive tech, some fail quickly and other outperform the market over 3-5 years. They top out and crash hard shortly after at the time she exits... Only to re-emerge with a ""new innovative ETF"". First sign of bad performance leads to her taking much higher risk and, in general, failing to preform. 





If you get in early and keep doing so she'll be good. If you get in once she's hit 100% returns you'll probably be bagholding when she's already bailed out."
6/28/2021 14:47,stocks,I doubt it. She's only had good results in her own during exceptional time i.e. Pandemic will see how ark fund fares once the wod recovers

6/28/2021 16:55,stocks,"Well, well. One and a half month ago, I was getting depressed, with one of my accounts 110K down from the Feb highs (and 50K negative in total), I was down about 24K just in tdoc and baidu, spread out all over with more than 90 stocks and ETFs. Almost liquidated everything so that I can sleep better again. 

Now, I am almost 30K up (that is +80K in about 40 days), and have managed to trim my portfolio to about 25 stocks, paid back all the 100K+ that I have invested using margins.

Hopefully, I will trim my porfolio even more, to about 10 stocks and put all the cash I have into ETFs/indexes in the coming few weeks. So looking forward to a time where checking my porfolio once a week or every other week will be sufficient. 

I have a feeling that had I not done anything during the last 40 days, I would have ended up better. But my main aim was peace of mind and glad I am getting there, and thank God, with some profit! Can't be any happier!

6/28/2021 13:26,stocks,"Question about Wash Sales. I understand the tax implications. And I understand why you should try to avoid it.

However, I’m wondering if it still makes sense to re-buy into a security if the price is attractive even if it would trigger a wash sale.

Example: 
- I buy into a stock at 50
- something happens and stock price drops. I decide to exit position before it drops too much
- sell at 45
- price reaches 30. 
- I think that a fair price is 40 and expect it to rebound. Seeing that 30 is an attractive price, i decide to-rebuy.

I understand this situation would trigger a wash sale, and I can’t write off that $5 loss.

But seeing that I can make a profit, i am not worried about writing off that loss. So then does it make sense to sometimes trigger Wash Sales? I am wondering how day traders deal with wash sales?"

Almost in small cap (<5B market cap) territory in a *really* bad industry to be in right now.

My prediction (and bet, doubled my long-term position in ZM last week) is that they drop NOV and *finally* pull the trigger on ZM. If SaaS peer companies ServiceNOW (NOW) and Paycom (PAYC) are in the index, there's no conceivable reason based on data Zoom shouldn't be on it. In fact, I bet they're on a Zoom call discussing this right now.

Better rip off the Band-Aid now before ZM breaks out of a massive 9 month cup, while trading at P/E values *way* below their S&P500 SaaS peers and growing more than twice as fast while international travel remains locked down.

6/28/2021 6:08,stocks,"Two stocks I’m about to add to my portfolio, I’m curious what people think. 

1. CCS. 

Short thesis: CCS has undergone massive growth in sales, profits, and cash flows while currently trading at p/e 7 and ps .8. There is a housing shortage right now, about 5.5 million homes. Wall Street forecasts home builders to do well and forecast this company to continue to grow. I already own Lennar and I’m gonna add a smaller amount of CCS. Stock price is way up over the last year but down 18% the last month. So it’s either a buy the dip or shitty momentum stock, pick one. I’m leaning toward it being a dip since overall momentum is still positive. 

Now, housing demand and prices will either slow down or decrease within the next year or two, I don’t expect crazy growth from CCS forever, but  at p/e 7 and p/s .8, they don’t need insane growth to be undervalued and a good buy. 

2. GRWG

This is a bit more of a gamble, it’s the so called Home Depot of weed, they sell growing equipment. Truly exponential growth in a growing market that has plenty of room for it to continue to expand into. The issue is it trades at 9 p/s and only recently became profitable."

6/28/2021 12:07,stocks,"Domestic USA air travel will continue to rebound, but it will be slower than many are reporting or expecting.  Several factors impacting this, including the rates for rental vehicles at destinations and hotel prices.  Typical pre-pandemic trips are just more expensive now, which is driving more to take closer to home vacations.  Kids are barely eligible for vaccines (12+ only) and the new variants do put them at risk.

Foreign travel will continue to lag.  Policies vary dramatically based on final destination and many USA to international routes are not restored.  Many only connect to single major hub and often that is London based.  With continued major UK travel restrictions and/or quarantine requirements, it does not help logistics with people looking to book those trips.  Mandatory quarantine on arrival makes many vacations impossible.  They might be on a 2-3 year cycle from recovery to anything resembling pre-pandemic levels.

One thing holding all of tourism back is a federally backed or verified vaccination passport system.  This pieced together approach just does not work.  If carriers or destinations could mandate vaccinations it would speed their economic recovery.  Likely dragging this out longer than it needs to be because that is not in place."

Biotech with anything remotely promising in AZ treatments or products in Phase 2/3 is always a good play if you're willing to take a bigger risk.

Certainly seems like Apple is a good investment long term, but the rate is not as steep as many want.  Would consider AMD and SPCE or even NGCA if you're looking for more risk/reward.  Personally would diversify a little and not dump all into one."

They went bankrupt 10 years ago and should've gone bankrupt a year ago.

They owe more in deferred pension liabilities than the entire market cap of the company lol. Their pilots and flight attendants are all white haired and ancient, and all of them retired during the pandemic, setting up those pensions to start kicking in.

If you were at gunpoint forced to invest in an airline, why in the world would you pick AA over Southwest or even Allegiant, Alaska or Spirit?

By the way, I've been pricing out flights over the past couple days, and Southwest is no longer a low cost airline. It may be a low-cost operator, but ticket prices are at parity now with legacy airlines..........which is probably good for investors, because tickets seem to be selling out still."

You can come to the conclusion that something is overpriced or underpriced, but if you buy one share of something at 2k, and 100 of something else at 20 dollars. It's the same amount invested. Unless you're looking to vote for the company's future you'll be more interested in which 2k investment does better. 

Put another way, if cheaper shares were the winning way, we'd all be buying penny stocks. But don't do that cause you'll likely lose it all. 

Same thing for swing trading but I don't do it. If you think it will have a 10% swing, does it really matter how many shares? At the end of the day you look at how much money you made"

PLANO, TX / ACCESSWIRE / June 25, 2021 / Torchlight Energy Resources, Inc. (NASDAQ:TRCH), an oil and gas exploration company ('Torchlight'), today announced that it paid the special Series A Preferred Stock dividend on a 1 for 1 basis to its stockholders of record on June 24, 2021. Torchlight also announced that it implemented a 1 for 2 reverse stock split of its Common Stock. The reverse split, which will become effective after market closing on June 25, 2021, was approved by the stockholders of Torchlight at its Special Shareholder meeting held on June 11, 2021. The 1 for 2 ratio represents the lowest amount Torchlight may implement under the 1-20 range that was previously approved by the stockholders.

Torchlight also announced that the steps necessary to close the business combination with Metamaterial Inc. were completed on June 25, 2021 and therefore Torchlight expects that the business combination will be effective on June 28, 2021 as of 12:01 AM EDT. Commencing on June 28, 2021 Torchlight's name will be changed to ""Meta Materials Inc."" and its common stock will begin trading on NASDAQ under the ticker symbol ""MMAT."""

PHM is poised for success with the current housing shortage.  They have the reserve capital and access to cheap capital from their LOC that will allow them to accommodate the inevitable demand for more housing units.  

What differentiates residential construction from riets is that Riets seek to capitalized rising housing prices and charge higher rents to maximize profits.  Residential construction is creating value and in PHMs case, doing it in an affordable way while using durable materials and strategic locations.  

The housing shortage is a part of a bigger problem - too much demand.  A shortage leads to rising prices, and in the current economy, this will work both ways for PHM.  

They will sell homes for higher, their assets will appreciate, and they will benefit from building more homes for at least 3 years (inflation and interest rates will start getting sweaty in 2024).  For a short period of time, debt and capital obligations will rise but then revenue, net income, and balance sheet size will all increase.  This probably won’t increase margins because they already have competitive margins and CAPEX will be higher anyways.  

There are a number of alternatives to PHM, notably MDC which is extremely similar but about 1/4 the size of PHM.  Both will do before inflation becomes visible with rising rates, and there will be significant growth, probably 25% YOY.  

I have about 5k cash in my investments account and $500 in PHM.  I have 3600 in a margin account.  If you guys convince me, I’ll move my cash into my margin account and buy some long term calls."

I've just been reading into REITs and have a few questions I would love to have answered. I read that share buybacks for REITs are divisive online, where some articles say it's beneficial and some say it's detrimental. What are the arguments to both sides? Why would a REIT buy back shares rather than issue a raise in dividends? Do REITs still buy back shares because they think they are undervalued similar to other equities? Thanks so much! I am a new investor so this means a lot!"
6/28/2021 1:00,stocks,"I much prefer buybacks to dividends in general and don’t see why it would be any different on a REIT. Why? Because a buyback is a permanent decrease in available shares, driving the up the value of the shares by scarcity, whereas quite often people will buy into a stock before the ex date, “scrape” the dividend and then sell, decreasing the value of the stock by the dividend you just received."
6/28/2021 1:00,stocks,Whoppers are better than Big Macs and that’s facts.
6/28/2021 11:06,stocks,"It makes no difference because REITs are not taxed at the corporate level thus there is little to no advantage to be had with buybacks. Plus I dont think that share buybacks qualify as distributions to meet REIT requirements for pass through taxation. You would need to check that but I am about 75% sure thats the case.

There are times when it might make sense, such as when they are trading far below value of assets but otherwise, there is little point to it. mREITs do buybacks all the time when their shares drop significantly below book value. But those guys also dilute a lot when above book value. Its simply part of their operating structure."

So…after close today, we should see a wave of announcements from the big banks regarding dividends and buybacks. Buybacks will consolidate earnings and lift share prices IMO. 

Is this priced in? Maybe. But these banks trade at 8-12 P/E’s and are stable and can withstand a big market correction and economic downturn. They also have good dividends.

If you own the charging station network, then you can:

1. Get data from the batter you are swapping, and essentially track where the car is/has been (based on the battery serial number that you installed in car 'x' at location 'a' and that battery ends up in your systems again at location 'Y'
   1. So, this is good for Big Data and tracking, who goes where.
   2. (not to mention picking up WiFi signals.)
2. You can block certain people from getting a battery swap for whatever reason, thus severely limiting/slowing down their movement capability.
3. One day decline to service your competitors' cars. So this is an added leverage to service negotiations.
4. Sell advertising.

6/28/2021 3:51,stocks,"A Roth IRAis a type of retirement account. You hold investments in it and when you reach retirement age you can start withdrawing the funds without having to pay taxes on the gains. VTI is an ETF. An ETF is a fund that invests in a bunch of different stocks and then sells shares of that fund. You can hold VTI in a Roth IRA, which is an excellent idea for a 16 year old to do. You will be so far ahead of 99.9% of people if you start investing that young."

6/28/2021 18:18,stocks,"My suggestion is to start a Roth IRA, even if it’s just a target date fund. Invest the maximum limit (if possible) and then invest any left over with a personal brokerage account. Both could be done with Vanguard or similar online brokerages. Although it sucks not being able to remove that money at will, compounding interest will set you up well for retirement with a “tax free” income. I’m sure the peanut gallery will roast this opinion though."

6/28/2021 0:58,stocks,"You’re taxed on the front end, but when you take the money out at retirement all your gains are tax free."
6/28/2021 13:28,stocks,"You have to have earned income for a Roth IRA by the way.

6/28/2021 7:41,stocks,So essentially the penalty and tax becomes more than what you would normally be taxed from capital gains?
6/28/2021 7:48,stocks,"So it looks like you can take out what you contribute. So for example you put in 6k, looks like you can take out 6k. Because that contribution already got taxed. But anything above, you pay a 10% penalty and potentially capital gains/income tax."
6/28/2021 7:53,stocks,But it seems like you're better off holding those assets till retirement right?
6/28/2021 8:03,stocks,"Clearly.  You *can* withdraw contributions at any time, but that's not really the best use of a tax-deferred retirement account (until one actually retires)."

I'm pretty new to investing, and trying to put a side part of my income as a egg nest for retirement.

I ran some numbers in a spreadsheet and if you start with 100,000; invest 1,000/month the first year and increase it by 2% each year; with a 7% roi; you’ll wind up with 1.5M after 25 years. This will be enough to start withdrawing 6562/month (4000 in today’s dollars) and increase that by 2% per year which will last for 25 years (with a more conservative 4.5% roi in retirement)."

But again—

Your $1M is probably too low

I tried to sock away 15-20% of my salary every year.  Plus I was lucky and got some nice employer matches on my 401k.  I didn’t do anything crazy in investing except went higher on stocks mutual funds than bond mutual funds than the “100 minus your age” formulas suggested that I should.

I’m mid 40s and have about $2.5M and only in the last few years did I start making more than $100K.  

I’m not thinking about retiring not knowing about healthcare, if social security will last, what inflation will do, and all the other things I haven’t thought about.

OR, if planing on using the core until depletion in 30 years, that mean that I'll only need $1.25m in 2045, while the unused amount kept with same 7% interest until depletion.The above number of $1.25m which should be enough for 30 years Retirement based on 2% inflation and 7% interest, requires monthly contributions of only $850 a month after the initial amount of $100k.

I know that nothing is certain, my question is if: 7% interest, average 2% inflation (or if higher, maybe interest will also get higher?), and my calculations making sense?

PLEASE TELL ME WHERE I'M WRONG

OR AM I RIGHT???

**And even with inflation at 3%, and 7% interest, $4k in 25Y is $8,460, which will require for 30 years until depletion (with core kept at 7%), only $1.78m, which require monthly contribution after the initial $100k of only $1,500 a month!!!**"

You said you want to withdraw 4,000 per month in today’s dollars. So 4,000 adjusted for 2% inflation per year will be $6562/month when you’re 67. In retirement you’ll need enough money to start withdrawing at that level and will need to increase that amount each year to keep up with inflation. I don’t know that 1 million will be enough, you’ll have to decide this.

I’m at work tonight and can’t access Google sheets through the firewall or I’d send you my spreadsheet. If you don’t get your answers by tomorrow I’ll check back in."
6/28/2021 13:49,stocks,"At $1800 a month that would get you to around $1.2m at 7% interest. You’d need roughly $3.8 million by 2045 to have the same buying power as $1.2m now. 


By the time you’re 67, $4000 a month in today’s money will be around $7,235, or around $86k a year you’ll need to withdraw. This is your starting point in retirement. 


Let’s say you live another 30 years. By the time you’re 97, you’ll need to withdraw over $13,748 a month, or around $164k a year. 



In other words, you’re looking at maybe 9-15 years of retirement if you start saving $1800 per month right now. 


1 million will not be enough.

Edit: Since you deleted the comment before I could reply, here is what I would’ve said: 


I used 2.5% inflation rate to be slightly conservative when accounting for inflation. 2% is considered best case scenario, 4% is considered most conservative 


> We can't know what the rate of inflation will be in future, years, so it's reasonable to assume the annual average of 3% -- or, if you want to be conservative and err on the side of caution, 4%.

Additionally I get that stock prices go up or down when someone agrees to buy shares at a higher or lower price than the previously. 

However...what I'm really after is how the exchange prices it exactly?

For example if I buy stock XYZ at $10.00, what is the exchange doing to move the price to $10.04 vs $10.07? 

Is there a specific algorithm or formula? 

Is it simply spitting out absolute latest buy/sell price sequentially?"

If more people think that, people will then buy at 10.08,10.09 but if it goes to 10.16, people will say nah that's overpriced and sell which pushes it down to 10.15.

You place a BID to buy and it gets filtered through several algorithms and places into the Order Book of the brokerage with other bids of the same price, and is filled when certain conditions are met. The same for Selling   Most times it seems instantaneous, but it's not. 


In order to move the price, on simply has to fill an order that causes the ""current"" bid or ask to be completely filled , and the next highest bid, or lowest ask creates a different spread with a different average.

In yet another blow to Boeing, the Federal Aviation Administration last month formally denied the jet maker permission to move forward with a key step in certifying its forthcoming giant widebody airplane, the 777X.

In a sternly worded letter dated May 13, which was reviewed by The Seattle Times, the FAA warned Boeing it may have to increase the number of test flights planned and that certification realistically is now more than two years out, probably in late 2023.

That could push the jet’s entry into commercial service into early 2024, four years later than originally planned.

The FAA cited a long litany of concerns, including a serious flight control incident during a test flight on Dec. 8, 2020, when the plane experienced an “uncommanded pitch event” — meaning the nose of the aircraft pitched abruptly up or down without input from the pilots.

Boeing has yet to satisfy the FAA that it has fully understood and corrected what went wrong that day.

The letter was signed by Ian Won, the manager of the local FAA office that judges whether Boeing has met all regulatory standards. He also told Boeing that a critical avionics system proposed for the airplane does not meet requirements.

And he expressed concern about proposed modifications involving late changes to both software and hardware in the electronics of the jet’s flight controls.

“The aircraft is not yet ready,” Won wrote. “The technical data required for type certification has not reached a point where it appears the aircraft type design is mature and can be expected to meet the applicable regulations.”

An FAA official, who asked not to be identified in order to speak freely, said the drag on 777X certification is now “the subject of a lot of attention” at high levels both within the agency and at Boeing.

Boeing’s last all-new jet, the 787, had to be grounded in 2013 when its batteries smoldered in flight. The next new plane, the derivative 737 MAX, was grounded for 21 months starting in 2019 after flawed new flight controls caused two fatal crashes.

Now the forthcoming 777X is having a troubled certification process. Is this just the FAA getting tough because of all the scrutiny?

The FAA official said that even if the MAX crashes hadn’t happened, the list of serious issues now raised about the 777X would merit rigorous regulatory attention.

Within the FAA, the person said, “there’s a general feeling that Boeing has kind of lost a step,” referring to the slide away from a historic reputation for engineering prowess.

And because of all the missteps, the official added, “the days of Boeing being able to say to the FAA ‘Just trust us’ are long gone.”

In a statement Friday, Boeing said it “remains fully focused on safety as our highest priority throughout 777X development.”

The airplane is undergoing “a comprehensive test program to demonstrate its safety and reliability … to ensure we meet all applicable requirements,” Boeing added.

The FAA in a statement said safety drives its decisions and timelines.

“The FAA will not approve any aircraft unless it meets our safety and certification standards,” the agency said.

FAA exasperated

Boeing launched the 777X at the Dubai Air Show in the fall of 2013, and at that time targeted 2020 as the year it would enter service.

Set to replace the Boeing 747 jumbo and Airbus A380 superjumbo passenger planes — which are no longer built — as the largest airliner in production, the 777X is a stretch version of the successful 777 passenger airliner featuring a new, superlong, carbon composite wing with folding tips and the largest jet engines ever built.

Boeing invested more than $1 billion in a new composites fabrication plant in Everett to build the wings.

Inside the main Everett assembly building, Boeing also installed state-of-the-art, automated stations to robotically assemble the wings — equipment designed by Mukilteo-based engineering company Electroimpact — and completely changed the way the 777 fuselage and wings come together to make assembly more flexible and efficient.

The first of two 777X models and the largest — the 777-9X, which carries 426 passengers in a two-class configuration — made its first flight in January 2020, kicking off the test flight program.

By now, four test planes are flying out of Boeing Field and at least 17 more 777Xs destined for customers Emirates, Lufthansa, Qatar Airways and All Nippon Airways have rolled out of the factory.

Boeing will have to park those production aircraft and any more built from now through at least late 2023 until certification allows their delivery.

The FAA’s letter on the status of 777X certification is addressed to Tom Galantowicz, the head of Boeing’s internal organization consisting of engineers and managers who act as proxies for the federal agency, tasked with testing and verifying that a new airplane design meets safety standards.

The letter denies Boeing a specific approval for the 777-9X called “Type Inspection Authorization” readiness. Without this, Boeing cannot put FAA personnel on board flight tests and begin to collect certification data.

The wording suggests a degree of exasperation with Boeing pushing for TIA when the FAA deems it far from ready.

“The FAA and Boeing have been discussing the TIA readiness of the Boeing Model 777-9 in numerous meetings over the past nine months,” the letter reads, adding that despite Boeing’s assertion that proceeding with TIA “warrants consideration,” the FAA in contrast “considers that the aircraft is not yet ready.”

The letter then lists a host of shortfalls in Boeing’s readiness.

FAA demands data, not promises

Asked about the test flight that experienced the “uncommanded pitch event” in December, Boeing said the plane went on to land safely and that engineers investigated the root cause and have developed a major software update to fix the problem.

In the meantime, until that’s approved, Boeing has given the test pilots instructions on how to avoid the incident recurring so that test flights can continue.

Yet the FAA clearly isn’t satisfied with Boeing’s promise of a software fix.

“After the uncommanded pitch event, the FAA is yet to see how Boeing fully implements all the corrective actions identified by the root cause investigation,” the letter reads.

“Software load dates are continuously sliding and the FAA needs better visibility into the causes of the delays,” it states.

To confirm “the maturity and safety/airworthiness of the aircraft,” the FAA demands comprehensive and documented reviews of the changes resulting from the investigation into the incident, to ensure that a similar problem “will not happen in the future and this is not a systemic issue.”

The FAA separately highlights concern over a critical piece of new avionics on the jet — the Common Core System, a set of shared computing resources critical to the functioning of multiple airplane systems.

Won notes that Galantowicz conceded in a letter to the FAA earlier in May that the CCS has incomplete software and does not meet TIA requirements.

Citing a “lack of data” and the absence of a Preliminary Safety Assessment for the FAA to review, the agency’s letter declares that Boeing hasn’t even met its own process requirements.

Boeing’s CCS “review dates have continuously slid over a year,” the letter notes.

In turning down the 777X for TIA readiness, the FAA also cited a finding that the supplier of the avionics provided “inadequate peer review” in a safety analysis “resulting in inconsistencies … and incorrect reuse of 787 data.”

GE Aviation’s plant in Grand Rapids, Michigan, supplies the CCS, which builds upon the similar common core avionics system it designed for the 787.

GE, which touts the CCS as the “central nervous system and brain” of the airplane, deferred comment to Boeing.

Demand for 777X currently near zero

Another problem for the FAA is Boeing’s proposal of late changes to the 777X flight control system.

“Boeing is proposing modifications that will involve firmware and hardware changes to the actuator controls electronics of the Flight Control System,” the FAA states. “Boeing needs to ensure the changes do not introduce new, inadvertent failures modes.”

Other pending modifications to the design of systems around the jet’s horizontal tail or stabilizer, which controls the pitch of the airplane, will change the crew alerts that flag certain system failures.

“Design maturity is in question as design changes are ongoing and potentially significant,” the letter states.

Separately, the letter states in passing that the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has also “not yet agreed on a way forward” with regard to 777X certification.

In an emailed response Friday, EASA spokesperson Janet Northcote said the agency is “cooperating closely with the FAA” on 777X certification.

“We are looking closely at the technical files with the FAA and Boeing and this work is still ongoing,” she said.

The FAA’s letter told Boeing that because of the gaps in the 777X technical data, it anticipates a significant increase in the required level of testing and analysis, “and the potential to increase the number of certification flight tests that will need to take place.”

The letter concludes by requesting that Galantowicz’s unit “close these gaps” before submitting any further requests for TIA approval and that “based on the information from Boeing,” 777X certification is realistically more than two years out, in “mid to late 2023.”

Ironically, the only positive for Boeing in this situation is that — because of the pandemic’s destruction of international air travel demand — no airline in the world wants a 777X right now.

When international travel begins to pick up again post-pandemic, airlines will begin service with smaller jets like Boeing’s long-range 787 until long-haul air travel gradually returns to a level approaching what was typical in 2019.

Yet at a Bernstein Research industry conference this month, Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun doubled down on the 777X despite all the setbacks. Once the jet is certified, he said, “it will have a 40- or 50-year run, and I think it will be one of the great runs of all time.”

“I have lots of confidence in it,” Calhoun said. “We love it.”

Boeing’s website lists 320 orders for the 777X, though because of the delays airline customers will have the option to cancel some of those and may switch to smaller Boeing jets.

Dubai-based Emirates, the largest 777X customer, reduced its initial order for 150 aircraft to 115, swapping out 35 of the 777Xs for 30 much less expensive 787s.

The original 777 flight test program in the mid 1990s, from first flight to certification, took 10 months. For the 737 MAX, that period was just over 13 months. During the problem-ridden and much delayed development of the 787, first flight to certification took just over 20 months.

The 777X is currently set to reach certification almost four years after first flight.

Citing the delays in getting the plane certified, Emirates airline President Tim Clark has said he doesn’t expect any 777X deliveries until 2024.

Realistically, that’s the earliest any global carrier might want to take delivery of such a huge aircraft. Four years late, that’s when the 777X may finally be ready."
6/27/2021 23:16,stocks,"...but somehow the 737 Max 8 is now OK.

Boeing has seriously departed left field with respect to properly engineered airliners responsible for carrying hundreds of lives at a time.

From non-triple redundant instrumentation, to instrumentation with failure modes where a 90 degree relative incident airflow can't be filtered out as erroneous input, to flight control software that can't be overridden by the pilot, to optional dual redundancy, to locating electrical switchboards containing breakers that would disable malfunctioning flight control systems *behind* the strapped-in pilots, to automated cockpit flight control amplification that is stronger than both pilots, to engines too big to fit under the wings so they're stuck out too far causing full takeoff power to produce a critical nose up attitude, to testing flight control software in a simulator instead of real live aircraft (and suffering the resulting negative transfer software testing results), to elevator trim jack screw striction issues that require ""the roller coaster method"" to correct runaway trim conditions (which, somewhat ironically, is the trim position required for takeoff in a Max 8), to taking training shortcuts that allow 737 legacy pilots to qualify for flying what is essentially a new type-model-series by taking an hour long ipad CBT, to outsourcing critical flight control software to developers who have absolutely zero experience writing software for flight control systems let alone avionics, to elevator control surface blow-down at dive speed with full power, to god knows what else Boeing has failed to engineer properly (I'm waiting for their 737 yaw dampener fiasco to crop back up with the new overpowered engines).

Fuck this shit.  It needs to stop NOW.

What we have seen lately (rising gas prices, rising vehicle prices, rising lumber prices, rising GPU prices, meat prices) is not inflation.

We shut down our economy for a year, fire workers, and companies protect themselves by producing less of items because they fear that there’s going to be less consumer spending. They were incorrect in this assumption. The supply chain has been disrupted and turned upside down. Now long term, we will see inflation, and the FED hasn’t denied that once, they’ve even stated they will up interest rates in 2023.

Inflation is inevitable, but too many people worry that it’s going to wreck businesses, wreck our economy, and even wreck our way of living. That simply isn’t true. The federal reserve has plenty of tools to stop anything like that from happening and they’re yet to deploy a single one of those tools. There isn’t a better person to be sitting at the chair than Jerome Powell, we are in good hands. Stocks are rising now because most people couldn’t imagine getting .25% interest on their money in a two year period. When interest rates rise, stocks will cool off and then people will come back.

In the long run the S&P 500 will rise and fall with profits of its components. Setting aside increased profitability from new products and layoffs which would help a stock go up despite inflation. Companies that have strong brands and decent pricing power should be able to raise their prices with inflation while not experiencing any serious decline in demand for their products. If they do this and grow their profits faster than the inflation rate their stock should rise faster than inflation. Companies that are in hyper competitive industries selling goods that are luxury items and have no brand should get hammered as they can't raise prices so easily. Of corse this all depends on how bad inflation is. In a moderate inflationary environment I would expect most companies would be able to offset inflationary pressures.

6/28/2021 7:09,stocks,"Agreed. Supply chains is arguably a bigger catalyst for increased inflation. There are shortages of everything, to some extent. That means the prices aren’t high enough yet. Supply and demand."
6/28/2021 14:19,stocks,I think hyperinflation in Germany after WW1 and in Zimbabwe more recently were caused by severe supply issues in addition to too much money printing. Lots of infrastructure and buildings were destroyed in Germany during the war and in Zimbabwe the government seized and mismanaged farms leading to massive food shortages. We have some supply chain issues in the US but not nearly as severe as either of those two scenarios.

6/28/2021 3:20,stocks,You see thats the problem itself there is a lot of money spread around with no production. When there is money and no production money becomes paper and commodities start to become expensive check CPI. If government doesnt take action like raising interest  rates stop their printing machines  because every dollar they print now the existing dollars loses purchasing power. Right now they claim is transitory they lie out of their teeth if they dont take action now the long run is going to be bad and Michael J Burry is gonna be right again.

6/28/2021 18:01,stocks,I'm guessing that would be the perfect time to buy.
6/28/2021 18:00,stocks,"I don't think your quite registering what hyperinflation is. 

In historical examples, hyperinflation has been known to cause prices to DOUBLE at the rate of once per day. So, if your stocks are not doubling in value every single day, then they are losing you money. Think how likely that is.

But you won't have to worry about that. Because you won't be buying stocks. No one will be. The bread down at the corner market would cost 100s of dollars. You'll blow through your life savings just trying to afford food. But really that's not a problem because your life savings are worthless. In a hyperinflation environment even a million dollar savings account will very quickly become inadequate to buy a single loaf of bread.

Affording your loaf of bread won't be much of a problem either though. Because the entire economic system of the United States will collapse in on itself, taking most the world down with it. The planet will enter a deep period of economic depression. Meanwhile, you at home will probably need to spend most of your time physically finding the food you need. Affording it will be a secondary concern. As the economy falls apart people will start returning to a barter economy, which will dramatically slow down the food supply. Better hope you don't live in the North and it's winter. No local food source will infame the problem. You'll most likely be spending your day in a government bread line. 

There is no investment strategy that maintains your wealth in a hyperinflation environment. Because the US dollar would be, quite literally, meaningless. It's value will be solely in its use as fire starter. A share you own, even if it's trading at a billion dollars per share, is most likely worthless in this environment.

Folks aren't telling op to not worry about this because they are too lazy to suggest damage mitigation strategies. They are telling op not to worry because A) it won't happen. And B) if it does, there is absolutely nothing OP can do to mitigate the damage. Plus, op will be too busy finding food to care."
6/28/2021 11:13,stocks,"Hyperinflation is typically understood to be inflation reaching more than 1,000% annually in a particular country. It has only occurred a handful of times in the history of capitalism.

The dollar is the global reserve currency and the U.S.-Chinese relationship powers the global economy. If the U.S. experiences hyperinflation, the entire global economy will be in a collapse scenario and much of the world will be struggling to secure food, shelter, clean water and personal safety. Stocks will be meaningless. My answer was an extremely serious one, and one that I believe is helpful."
6/28/2021 12:24,stocks,">This is a common, snarky take that doesn’t help much.



You mean it's the correct answer, one that actually does help a lot. 

>Is the SPY a good way to get those? Maybe. That’s OP’s question.

No, it won't be, it'll be worthless as shit. Actually I guess you could threaten to throw poop at the guy if he doesn't give you bread, so literal human shit might actually be worth more in this scenario. Your stocks will not matter at all if there is hyperinflation. By the time you've sold your SPY into fiat, and the 3 day transfer into your bank, you'll have lost 50%+ of your investment or more.

The stock market caught up to that inflation in the following years. 2021 isnt the same though because the dollar is no longer tied to gold the way it was back then. Take a second and google Venezuelas stock market and you'll see what happens due to real hyper inflation. Even over the last year in the US you can see how the stock market has performed while GDP was diminished.

Durring the 1970's and early 80's the U.S had high inflation yet the S&P 500 declined in the same period. Also just because a market average goes up doesn't mean you are beating inflation. To use your example the Venezuelan stock market has gotten hammered by inflation in 2020. The data is difficult to find but from what I can tell in 2020 the Venezuelan stock market was up 600% while inflation was up 2,000%. Meaning if you held stocks you would've lost most of you capital to inflation. I'm not trying to make the case that the 2021 U.S stock market will underpreform inflation. I just think Ben Graham is right when he says its not garanteed that the stock market will beat inflation.

This decision comes just over a year since the two companies announced on January 22, 2019 that they had concluded a business integration contract and a joint-venture contract toward the establishment of a new company. Toyota and Panasonic have also decided the outline of the joint venture.

Batteries―as solutions for providing energy for automobiles and various other forms of mobility, and as solutions for various kinds of environmental issues―are expected to fulfill a central role in society going forward―a role that supports people's lives.

The joint venture announced by Toyota and Panasonic will develop highly competitive, cost-effective batteries that are safe and feature excellent quality and performance (in terms of capacity, output, durability, etc.), enabling use with peace of mind by all customers. Furthermore, the joint venture will supply batteries not only to Toyota but also, broadly and stably, to all customers.

The joint venture's name embraces Toyota's and Panasonic's strong determination to provide their customers―while working in unison with many friends to keep our irreplaceable earth abundant and clean―broad-ranging, added-value solutions including and beyond the supply of energy in the form of batteries.

6/28/2021 0:38,stocks,"This.  Plus the hard reality is that we haven't actually seen real world progress in battery technology for at least 15 years.  It's just not happening the way we all wished.  Tesla batteries are just bundles and bundles of Li-Ion cells, the same basic battery technology as we had in 2002 flip phones and rechargeable flashlight batteries.  The battery in your iPhone 12 is effectively the same tech as the original generation.

Yes, people are talking about a solid state experiment in a lab.  But that's years away from dipping its toe into a consumer flashlight, then it will have to be tried as a phone battery, then a laptop.  It probably won't go straight from 3 grams to 300 pounds.  

Older people will remember the decades of moving from NiMh and other battery types to Li-Ion, how we had to learn by doing, iterating product after product and design after design to optimize charging and safety and things.  

So even if solid state is the miracle, it's far, far away.  And if it has some flaw or obstacle, it's not like there's a plan C waiting in the wings.  

What's a more imminent concern is that we don't have anything like a proper grid for even a fraction of the EV cars that makers claim they're going to sell.  Our populated states have rolling brownouts and fall over during any weather incident.  There is no realistic chance of anyone investing the trillions to modernize our century-old grid, especially as we are currently seeing one political party obstructing and diminishing even the downsized infrastructure plan.  

And even if we had a grid, it's not like residences have 10,000 watt extra capacity to just let everyone plug in their family EVs, especially not when they all finish work at the same time and go try to plug in.

There could be a silver lining in this grid disaster though.  It could drastically pull forward progress on self-generation using renewables.  People will face a choice: wait 20 years for your electric grid upgrade, or spend a few bucks now to put solar/wind and storage into our dwellings.  My guess is that people who want EVs will have to self-subsidize their own electric sources."

A small lightweight engine may lack the power necessary for adequate acceleration, so augment it with electric motors and store energy in batteries or capacitors.

Once they release the new batteries and actually figure out FSD they'll be way ahead again. But for now a lot of large manufacturers have caught up with Tesla's current capabilities. 

>New 4680 batteries

Tesla's new batteries have been announce but **haven't gone into mass production or even implemented on a smaller scale yet**. The reason I didn't include this into calculating the gap between manufactures is because it hasn't started mass manufacturing. At the same time Tesla stressed that they're focused on creating a new supply chain to account for the increase in raw materials they'll need. 

Once they can reliably produce these batteries they'll be an entire generation ahead of the competition like they were ~5 years ago. But currently they're still not ready and we need to use what they current possess, not potential tech that'll help them in the future. 

>Which other auto manufacturer is even working on this? I think you are undervaluing what Tesla is doing here.

You're misunderstanding my point, I stated that Tesla's capabilities aren't anywhere near the goal they gave themselves. Their auto pilot is very impressive but it's current valuation is set at levels for full FSR not just advanced driver assist functionality. 

Also I would say the most comparable would be Mercedes, they've had a fairly good driver assist function back in the early 2000s. IIRC they were the first manufacture to include radars into their cars to help them track cars in front of them.

And IIRC they upgraded that driver assist function to also work at low speeds back in 2008. 

The only thing I see Mercedes lack is FSD which is available to Tesla owners through a **beta program**, which is why I didn't include it into the calculation. 

What I can say is that Tesla's driver assist is as advanced, if not a little more, than Mercedes and they offer it at relatively affordable prices. 

>No other US auto manufacturer is any better. Ford and GM vehicles are plagued with build problems as any owner will tell you. The only ones who can claim build superiority are the Japanese manufacturers (Toyota, Honda, and so on).

I never said they're far behind now, I said they used to be behind in terms of manufacturing but they have recently closed that gap by simplifying their chassis. IIRC their new chassis is already in production which is why I included that in the calculation when comparing Tesla with other manufacturers."

The result could be significant cost and weight savings for the vehicle. To reduce to absolute absurdity, calculate efficiency not as the amount of fuel used to power to the wheels, but rather, fuel used per mile traveled of passengers and cargo, and things start getting weird when you can significantly reduce the weight of the vehicle to where a lightweight inefficient system on its own sounds bad, except when you factor in the amount of fuel consumed carrying around some heavy ass engine or battery.

6/28/2021 11:46,stocks,"The company might make great products but I question their strategy at this time.

Their own reports on EVs and their plans point blank state they expect to sell just >1 million EVs in 2030, not a very firm commitment. In 2019 they sold 10.75 million cars.

Compare that position to all the major traditional auto OEMs and they are far behind. VW expects to sell 3 million EVs in 2025 alone. Ford/GM are both targeting a 25-50% of all their vehicle sales being EV by 2030. And the line ups reflect that with other majors already introducing EV models that duplicate their name brands. Like the F-150.

(Also, you'll get 200-300k out of almost any name brand these days so long as you are taking care of it.)"

6/28/2021 14:19,stocks,"Have you looked at any of Tesla's financial statements? Their revenues are growing exponentially every quarter and they don't have any debt. The only reason they don't appear to be profitable is because they funnel all of their money into research. No debt payments, no dividends. Pure R&D. That is the reason their PE is high but their PS is almost the same as MSFT.

Granted, Tesla wasn't profitable until maybe a year or two ago. But they are raking in the profits now. Compare that to Ford and GM who have a combined debt of over $250 billion. Where are they going to find the money to pivot to EV? Meanwhile every EV sale they make cannibalizes one of their ICE sales. They are going to lose more money the more EVs they make. The writing is on the wall for the legacy automakers."

That’s not taking into account that busy supercharger stations won’t even allow you to charge past 80% and you may even have to wait to start charging which hasn’t been taken into account. 

So your real life 200 mile range suddenly might become 160 because the charge station was busy and limited you to 80% charge. 

Can you seriously imagine a long road trip with impatient kids in the car and having to stop for an hour or more every 160 miles and tell me that’s even close to comparable to a combustion vehicle?"
6/28/2021 15:06,stocks,Hard (probably impossible) to make a call on how the tradeoff is going to look without knowing how much it's actually going to cost. It all hinges on that and how much the cost of solid state can come down as it scales up.

That’s why Toyota is behind technology wise on some things; because they want to perfect the reliability.  They have bet heavy on hydrogen and to this point, it looks like a DUD.  But, that’s what some people were saying about Hybrid technology at first.  Don’t ever bet against Toyota!  

High mileage Model S can be bought in the high teens to low 20s; Taxi and road service companies like that price range even if the battery range is 40 to 60 percent of what it was originally.  All the other stuff (ie the screens dying, power windows not working, suspension noise…etc) they ignore and keep on driving them."

Type in how eco friendly Tesla is to the environment to build their cars. There the WORST in the US,and thats saying something.

Plus how many cars have they rolled out to make these profits? Musk said 500,000 by this year... there nowhere near close to that. Plus he downplayed covid to get his factories going again. 

Why? Because he was 1.4b off his Q target which would of put 750million in his back pocket.

I personally sold most of my position around $30 but I'm letting a small amount ride through the summer as that was my original plan before the huge run up (bought at $17 price target was originally $25 conservatively and $30 aggressively).

6/28/2021 0:00,stocks,"Rad - The Unbiased information you need to make a proper decision, information from the CEO to cash flows to debt, but simple. Good luck Happy Sunday everyone, and thank you very much for giving a few minutes of your precious time to read this post. I will not bore you with tons of data on Rite Aid, symbol RAD but I will cut to many key points that are unbiased so you can make a decision. But I do want everyday traders to see many of the key points..

I have traded RAD quite alot in 2021, I am a day trader. Most recently I made some trades on Thursday and still have 1 block of shares at 17.45.

RAD in terms of footprint in the US is the 3rd largest pharmacy in the US. 1st is CVS, 2nd is Walgreens. At current date they have about 2,500 stores after making a cash purchase of Bartel for under 100 million for drug stores in WA. This chain in WA was already profitable so this was indeed a very good acquisition. 

In 2017 Walgreens purchased exactly 1,932 stores from RAD for 4.4 billion dollars in cash. At that time in 2017, RAD was bleeding cash..... RAD had atrocious cash flows, was losing tons of money and had roughly 8.5 billion in debt.. Walgreens had tried to buy RAD completely but the government was against this. The coupon bond on their loan was closer to 10%......... Now RAD 2,500 stores strong is valued at 900 million as of this writing. They have 3 billion in debt at 6% rate. This matters so that you can see the finances have gotten better, but even this debt with the market cap, the better performing stores has the CAP + DEBT at under 4 billion.....remember Walgreens purchased 1,932 stores for 4.4 billion in 2017.

The old CEO of RAD really did RAD in, believe it or not RAD was actually close to a 100 billion dollar company, the one that sits at 900 million now! Just check a chart. John Standley first took SAV On.... which went bankrupt. He often hires all his buddies and then the ship sinks...... He actually tried to get RAD to merge with Albertsons when Walgreens buy out failed. When the new CEO Heyward Donigan came aboard about 2 years ago, it gave me reason to take a look at RAD again. Onboard she was given a $530,00 salary with many types of bonuses, that will be important later but right now I am trying to focus on the turn around. At this time 6-7 quarters ago RAD was under $5 and I was happily trading it.. While she has been on board she has dropped the debt by 4-5 billion. The company is now profitable again. She has lowered the coupon bonds, made a large acquisition. A complete redesign. If you take a look at the last 6 quarters you will see where she has beat on the bottom line..... .ALL 6!!!  You would think the stock as well as her should be rewarded..

The past 2 quarters she has revised down guidance...... only to beat...... I am wondering if she is doing what we call ""Sandbagging"" not worried about the stock price for now, but making guidance easy to easily beat. I did some digging which took me time and I found her pay package as well as a breakdown when she joined in 2019. She made 8.3 million in bonus for 2020....... Unfortunately we do not know what the board votes for her to receive bonuses.....In 2019 she received onboard bonus for joining the team... It says in the SEC document that the board will vote each year to determine how/what she needs to do to achieve the bonus..... it could be the bottom line earnings which I am not sure... but if that is the case it make sense for her to lower guidance each quarter and beat easily. However, short term the stock will suffer.

In 2021 for full year the company is expecting revenues of 25+ billion and is expecting to lose about 20 million. Her lowered guidance for 2022 called for earnings before interest+taxes of 450 million.. Analysts had it at 500.... So outside of interest on the 3 billion and now a lower rate near 6% they are expected to make 450 million.... that sounds good to me! I believe they will come in higher but you can do your own research.

Finally, you must ask yourself, in the past 4 quarters is this company doing better now over last year? How were earnings? What do the financials say? Is this stock worth 16.50 = 900 million or more? Going forward do I feel it should be higher or lower? Do I have this confidence to buy now? Has the ship turned?

Feel free to share thoughts and thanx for your time.."
6/27/2021 23:45,stocks,"Rite Aid beat the Q1 fiscal 2022 adjusted EPS number by a mile.  Like $0.38 per share versus analyst expectations of $0.22 per share.

Yet, the RAD stock price was knocked down almost 20% because, as indicated in the OP notes above, the CEO sandbagged the rest of the year (look at the assumptions she made --- was not even hiding the fact that she was sandbagging).

This gave shorts an opportunity to jump all over the stock.  The June 15, 2021 short report showed 8.93 million shares short.  That was up by 600,000 shares from the start of the month.  I wouldn't be surprised if the number of shares short now is close to 10 million.  And that does not even include dark pool shorting of RAD.

It's crazy --- the company turns the corner, beats adjusted EPS with a strong result, and the stock is crushed by a CEO who wants to give herself a low bar for the rest of the year and shorting hedge funds who were just looking for an oppotunity to continue driving Rite Aid's stock price lower."
6/28/2021 6:25,stocks,"I would love to believe everything here but it’s just not true! Please get your facts correct, it just makes you seem un credible. Rite Aid is definitely undervalued particularly to a strategic buyer like Walgreens and also for regular shareholders if they can cut costs and show some sustainable profits which unfortunately I don’t see them doing any time very soon."
6/28/2021 1:28,stocks,"Hi RAD employee here. Fiscal 22 bonus is set to be more rewarding than ever with 200+% incentives. For store and field associates. Fiscal 21 bonus was thrown away and all eliginle employees were given a 50% of base bonus. This included field and store associates.

Maybe sheds light on Heyward's bonus? 

But I will say there are many internal changes at the company that seem to be solely for appeasing the shareholder's and that is the sentiment around the company. These are thankless tasks that are not rewarding results but look good on newsreel. So this may play into your sandbagging notion.

This piece never referenced rite aids PBM elixir which is the main factor to me when assessing their value. The reasoning behind the lowered evaluation for year was due to decreased value in elixir due to a lowered reach in customer base and lower reimbursement rate for medicare customers.(this is the entirety of drug stores business).

Tldr. Bullish on current value but expect yo-yo price action. 16-22 then back to 18-24 etc. Very unlikely the company breaks the 28-30 range for the remainder of year without absolutely crushing during holiday months due to a strong flu aeason."

Then she should say that. It doesn't make a lot of sense, but sandbagging seems to be a pattern."

It's my opinion that for the company to exceed projection they need to focus attention on distribution centers and supply chain. We have yet to see the return on an influx of new customers to stores due to covid vaccinations and I fear it has less to do with drug store pricing rather than supply issues in certain categories."

Deep Dive - a great business that has recently been oversold over transient factors Original Post at [https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/o3a7ng/lzb\_lazboy\_inc\_deep\_dive\_a\_great\_business\_that/](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/o3a7ng/lzb_lazboy_inc_deep_dive_a_great_business_that/)

 Hello everyone, please see below my DD analysis on La-Z-Boy ($LZB). I would love to hear everyone's opinion.

**What Does La-Z-Boy Do?**

La-Z-Boy is one of the largest furniture manufactures in the United States. They are based in Monroe, Michigan, and they make home furniture, including upholstered recliners, sofas, stationary chairs, lift chairs, and sleeper sofas.

La-Z-Boy furniture is sold in thousands of retail residential outlets in the United States and Canada and is manufactured and distributed under license in other countries including the United Kingdom, Australia, Germany, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Turkey, and South Africa. La-Z-Boy holds US and international patents on more than 200 different styles and mechanisms. They employ approximately 9400 workers at this time.

La-Z-Boy Incorporated is divided into three reportable operating segments: the Upholstery Group, the Casegoods Group, and the Retail Group.

The Upholstery Group primarily manufactures and sells upholstered furniture to furniture retailers and proprietary stores. This includes recliners and motion furniture, sofas, lift chairs, loveseats, chairs, ottomans, and sleeper sofas.

The Casegoods Group primarily sells manufactured or imported wood furniture to furniture retailers, including tables, chairs, entertainment centers, headboards, dressers, accent pieces, and some coordinated upholstered furniture.

The Retail Group consists of 70 company-owned stores in the US. The Retail Group sells mainly upholstered furniture to end consumers through the retail network.

In July 2018 La-Z-Boy also acquired online furniture company Joybird for an undisclosed amount.

**The bull case**

* **Reason #1 - Oversold - It is trading well below fair value after being dumped over the past 2 days -** [Nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/an-intrinsic-calculation-for-la-z-boy-incorporated-nyse%3Alzb-suggests-its-21-undervalued) published an article 2 days ago saying the stock was trading 21% below value when it was trading at $42. Now it is at $36, the long-term support, which makes it approximately 33% below fair value. What is the reason for the selloff? In their earnings call, they issued a warning about a temporary negative impact to profit margins in the short term due to raw material price increases right now. However, they also said these issues will be offset by previously announced pricing actions as the company works through its immense backlog in the back half of the year. So basically, the selloff is an overreaction as their earnings report came out the same day Chairman Powell did his press conference and caused the whole market to dump.
* **Reason #2 - The stock will recover soon because it does this -** Because this stock has a relatively low market cap any negative news causes a dump that soon recovers. Simply looking at the chart over the past 6 months will show other such instances including the last major dump to this support level on February 1 and the subsequent recovery by 10%+ in only 8 days and a 20%+ recovery in just over a month after that.
* **Reason #3 - Never before seen boom in home furnishings -** Warren Shoulberg, a senior editor at Forbes, noted that LZB is the poster child for the boom in home furnishings sales. [r/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/) does not allow linking to Forbes due to blog-style articles being published there so I will simply point out some salient points from the story -

>If you want to know how real the boom in home furnishings sales is and how much America is spending to make their homes nicer, all you have to do is ask La-Z-Boy.By one measurement that the company uses, “written same-store sales” for the entire Galleries network doubled, increasing 100% for the quarter. For the year, those sales were up 31%.

Their CEO noted the following in the earnings call (also covered at Forbes) -

>For the fiscal 2021 fourth quarter, record sales led to all-time record profits driven by increased production capacity, excellent performance by our company-owned La-Z-Boy Furniture Galleries stores, and continued growth and profitability at Joybird.Fiscal 2022 is off to a great start with continued robust written order rates and a record backlog, setting us up well for a strong year of shipments ahead.

* **Reason #6 - Dividend-paying stock -** LZB suspended their dividend last year due to the pandemic but it has been reinstated as of this quarter. Part of the recent selloff was possibly also because the dividend was just paid this month. If they follow the same trend as they always have in years prior to COVID they should be expected to announce their next dividend in late August with dividend payment in early-mid September. Here is their dividend history-

[https://www.streetinsider.com/dividend\_history.php?q=lzb](https://www.streetinsider.com/dividend_history.php?q=lzb)

**The Bear Case**

* **Reason #1 - Continued global supply chain issues. Raw material prices skyrocket even higher -** The primary reason for the selloff appears to be management's warning about a temporary negative impact to profit margins in the short term due to raw material price increases. LZB's problems could be exacerbated if inflation continues to run hot and raw material prices skyrocket even higher.
* **Reason #2 - Suspension of dividends again -** LZB management suspended their dividend for 4 quarters due to Covid and only recently reinstated it last quarter. A major supply chain disruption or other internal issues could cause them to suspend it again.

**What are the transient factors that have affected the price of the stock?**

I am adding this section to clarify this point. I will quote directly from the earnings call which can be read in its entirety here-

[https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/06/16/la-z-boy-incorporated-lzb-q4-2021-earnings-call-tr/](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/06/16/la-z-boy-incorporated-lzb-q4-2021-earnings-call-tr/)

This is what caused the selloff-

>Regarding production capacity, demand trends remained strong across the business with backlog at record levels, providing for a long tail. We anticipate ongoing incremental increases in capacity through fiscal 2022 as new assembly cells are added and efficiencies improve, which will result in continued incremental progress on delivered sales. However, we expect temporary significant pressures on profit margins in the first half of fiscal '22 compared to the very strong profit margin of this Q4. We expect to face ongoing global supply chain disruptions and escalating raw material and freight costs, which will cause volatility in results and will eventually be offset by our already announced pricing actions in the back half of the year as we work through our backlog.

Analysts clarified this point further during the call:

>**Bobby Griffin** \-- *Raymond James & Associates, Inc. -- Analyst*  
So Bob, I just want to circle right back quickly to your comments about the 300 bps of margin pressure just to make sure we're all on the same page of what's that referencing in kind of what timeframe. So is that in reference to the 10% EBIT margin that was posted in 4Q? And are you saying that 1Q and 2Q of 2021 should be down about 300 bps at the highest level possible versus first at 10% if raw material headwinds were as strong as they could be?  
**Robert Lucian** \-- *Chief Financial Officer*  
That's correct.  
**Bobby Griffin** \-- *Raymond James & Associates, Inc. -- Analyst*  
Okay. And then -- so for both quarters kind of the same type of trajectory off the 10%. I mean, that would put 2Q though below where kind of it was in the October of '19 quarter which was 7.5%. Is that all just raw material related or mix of business or could we end up at 7% EBIT margins below than kind of where we were two years ago even?  
**Robert Lucian** \-- *Chief Financial Officer*  
It's mostly the raw material impacts that we're seeing. And again, we've taken pricing and it's taking a while for that pricing to work its way through. So it will work its way through by toward the end of Q2 into Q3 and that's when our margins will start improving.  
**Bobby Griffin** \-- *Raymond James & Associates, Inc. -- Analyst*  
Okay. All right, that's helpful. And then trying to -- usually 1Q is the seasonally weak quarter, but with this large of a backlog that you have, I think in the 10-K it was $617 million or something called out. I mean, is the right way to think about the potential revenue side of things here in 1Q basically 12, 13 of what you delivered in 4Q or is there something wrong with kind of using that as an estimate?  
**Robert Lucian** \-- *Chief Financial Officer*  
I don't think there's anything wrong using that as an estimate.

As such, their margins may be lower this quarter if raw material prices continue to be as high as they've been but they've already taken actions that will cause this pressure to lift by the end of Q2 going into Q3 and while margins may be lower the actual revenue and profits will again beat records thanks to the immense backlog in orders that they're now fulfilling thanks to the additional capacity they have added.

**Financials & Valuation**

LZB balance sheet can be viewed at [https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/quote/LZB/balance-sheet?p=LZB](https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/quote/LZB/balance-sheet?p=LZB) for reference to what I state below.

* LZB is a profitable business with a consistent adjusted EBITDA margin of around 10% which is in line with industry standards -[https://csimarket.com/Industry/industry\_Profitability\_Ratios.php?ind=407](https://csimarket.com/Industry/industry_Profitability_Ratios.php?ind=407)
* Debt-free - LZB is debt-free.
* Short-term assets ($926.2M) exceed short-term liabilities ($611.7M).
* Short-term assets ($926.2M) exceed long-term liabilities ($392.5M).
* Regarding valuation, I have already covered this in the bull case where LZB is now nearly 33% undervalued as per the [Nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/an-intrinsic-calculation-for-la-z-boy-incorporated-nyse%3Alzb-suggests-its-21-undervalued) calculation. The Nasdaq story only says 21% because it was published when the stock price was still $42 and it is now trading around $36.

Based on all this I believe LZB is a great business and iconic brand that is currently trading well below fair value. I believe this represents a great investment opportunity.

**TL;DR:** LZB stock faced a selloff this week because management warned that record high raw material prices would affect their bottom line in the short term. Management also noted that these issues will be offset by previously announced pricing actions as the company works through its immense backlog in the back half of the year. Considering this, I believe the stock is oversold as it is considered as much as 33% undervalued as per [Nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/an-intrinsic-calculation-for-la-z-boy-incorporated-nyse%3Alzb-suggests-its-21-undervalued) at current prices which represents a great investment opportunity."

6/28/2021 0:00,stocks,"Want to hear from those who day trade large % of their accounts on a single stock that runs for the day and exit by closing bell While this strategy has its own pros and cons I am wondering if people use it and if so, what has been their experience and how they feel about it compared to other strategies.

What I like about it is that you get to stay liquid all the time and don't need to hold anything overnight + since you are going in heavy the returns must be good enough compared to what you would have made if you had just put in 5% of your money.

And obviously the cons being if you accidentally catch the top or if anything goes south right around the entry price, you stop out with a loss.

Since I haven't tried this strategy myself, I am sure I might be missing a lot of things which is why I am interested to know what has and what hasn't worked for those who have gone down this route. TIA.

Also I am referring to large cap stocks, not penny stocks. E.g. if PTON has a 5% day, you day trade it and catch like 3-4% on the way up and get out end of day.

On the flip side, for a very volatile meme stock I might only be comfortable trading 10% of my account with a stop 2.5% away. Therefore max loss would be 0.25% of the account. 

By doing this, at no point during my trades do I get particularly nervous as my max losses are well defined and relatively small. However on occasion I'm able to capture profit on a 10-20% mover, effectively increasing my account by 2-4% on a single trade."

But you see it gets worse, because the more the CCP brought the army and the police into HK to crush democracy the more the stock went up.

When I started investing I swore off oil stocks and that I would ""vote with my money"" by not investing in companies I didn't want to support, and investing in quality companies that I think are doing good work (my first investment was TSLA in 2018).

That lasted a while until I saw a great opportunity in oil and I justified it to myself that it was okay to purchase. I never liked seeing it in my portfolio overviews though. I no longer hold any oil investments and I don't know that I ever plan to again. There's lots out there. 

REIT's I like the large dividends and relatively stable business. It's kind of a boomer stock and can be boring, I much prefer tracking developments in a growing business that I feel like I'm a part of. REITS just don't do it for me. But they sure pay.

Unethical business practices out the ass - app store monopolization, purposely slowing down older phone models, usage of child labor. Most recently their whole ""environmentally friendly"" movement.

They didn't include a charger because of all the ""environmental waste"" it would cause, but they made it impossible for people (and many small businesses) to repair their phones so you HAVE to take it to Apple, which costs over half the cost of a new phone. This will lead people to tossing out their old phones every time their screen gets a crack.

GME has a dead business model that preys on people selling games for pennies on the dollar of what they bought it for brand new a little while ago.  A $60 game that I bought a few months ago is now worth only $10 to them but I could sell the same game for $30 on eBay.  Would rather exchange games via ebay and do a little work than go into a GameStop."

Prices will drop significanfly and a thriving local blackmarket will develop before MO has a shot at industry takeover.

In addition, the ban on menthol and discussion of nicotine limits threatens the addictions that secure their profits.  At least in my own circles, the end of covid has also seen a ton of people finding the motivation to quit smoking."

6/27/2021 21:40,stocks,"It has been suggested that smoking may be an attempt by schizophrenic patients to alleviate cognitive deficits and to reduce extrapyramidal side-effects induced by antipsychotic medication. Cigarette smoke also increases the activity of CYP 1A2 enzymes, thus decreasing the concentration of many drugs, including clozapine and olanzapine. There is also evidence that smoking is associated with increased clearance of tiotixene, fluphenazine and haloperidol. Given the high frequency of smoking in schizophrenic patients, clinicians need to check smoking status in each patient. Schizophrenic patients who smoke may require higher dosages of antipsychotics than nonsmokers. Conversely, upon smoking cessation, smokers may require a reduction in the dosage of antipsychotics.   https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19794359/"

6/28/2021 1:23,stocks,"Lets break it down a little more past surface level. They know smoking is objectively harmful and doesnt benefit society. It also plays on primal addictions. Yet they still knowingly target the young and stupid demographics. Imagine some snakeoil salesman peddling shit to a child using their favorite toy. This raises some eyebrows.

Its in their best interest to subdue or lobby any opposition. This then turns the playing field from ""its your own fault"" to a more systematic and underlying issue, one that isnt obvious. If eyebrow raisers werent concerned before, this gets them really riled up when family members start dropping left and right. You say this stuff is now obvious but history has shown that statement is objectively false just decades ago for the reasons above.

You can argue that people should just change but a lot of this happens in peoples formative years. Its no different than how ""influencers"", traditions, etc get passed down and dictate their hobbies. In the end please dont make excuses for how corporations act. Everything they do is calculated and more nuanced than whats at surface level which is what they want. If they could, they would absolutely bury you if it made them a net profit.

Some American companies no longer have Americans best interest in mind as they see more growth in China which is very very concerning as an American.

In spite of physician labor costing less than a couple percent of overall healthcare expenditure, HCA and others have been putting massive lobbying through to state senates via AANP/PA to push through laws that would allow PA’s and NP’s to be considered equivalent to doctors and allowed to practice by themselves, so they can fill physician spots with some people who they can pay about half.

FIGS panders to this too and some other toxic subcultures in the medical profession so I don’t like them either."
6/28/2021 9:57,stocks,"They pander to and enable some of the toxic subculture developing in medicine thanks to groups like the HCA. In short, these corporate hospital groups will do what they can to shave off any cost, including physician labor costs even though physician labor is a tiny fraction of healthcare expenditure. The way they are doing this now is to create subversion within medicine and lobby aggressively to state senates via AANP/PA to push through laws that allow NP’s and PA’s to practice unsupervised and as equivalent to physicians in spite of having approximately 1/8th of the training. To further facilitate this they add the right for those same people to introduce themselves as doctor with no further elaboration. That way they can fill spots that require a physician, but put in someone who commands half the pay instead. Essentially they’ve calculated that they think the extra med/mal lawsuits will be less than the total savings on physician labor.

FIGS panders to this subculture of a minority of NP/PA’s who are drinking that kool aid thinking that a 1.5 year online degree and 500 unstructured clinical hours is equivalent in quality to medical school and residency that physicians go through."

Apple comes out with their music streaming service, ""why would you buy that when you have Pandora or Spotify or the many other better services"".

6/28/2021 6:48,stocks,"As someone who didn’t use social media for 5 years then made an Instagram this year I think it’s actually quite useful. I travel a lot and frequently meet new friends/potential romantic interests who I really enjoy but our interactions are limited by circumstance. The big upsides of Instagram over phone numbers are:

1) Stories allow people to see what you’re up to and can re-ignite connections from the past that would remain dormant otherwise. I’ve been hit up by people I haven’t talked to in years and vice versa when we see what’s going on with each other’s lives. I know people who have reconnected with friends they met many years back due to using stories while traveling. This never happens with the huge backlog of phone numbers in my contacts which remain unused.
2) Interestingly enough for dating I’ve found I can use Insta to treat myself like a long term stock rather than someone who needs to impress others in the spur of the moment. I can focus on living my best life via  improving my body, exploring the world, and learning interpersonal skills such as dancing, and use Instagram to document all this. Then, when people add me they can see my value without me needing to sell them on everything I’ve ever done so they’ll be interested enough to text me later. I used to get ghosted all the time because it’s simply hard to put a face and a personality to some number on your phone. However with insta I found this rarely happens anymore because my presence comes through much deeper.

I’ve met lots of awesome people in my life but phone numbers just didn’t work that well for continuing new friendships/potential romances. I dislike some features of Instagram like the power dynamics of followers but overall I’m glad there exists a way for me to reliably stay connected with people after I meet them."

The increase in minimum wage from Amazon in the last few years (I think 2020 it was $15) has come after YEARS and years of public/ government pressure. Sure it’s a good thing they increased their wages but they also had ulterior motives, a big one being to sway off potential unionization. 
This company was busted having their workers pee in bottles to “meet workplace demands”.

Tesla  can and DOES disable your car and or features if they discover you made ""unauthorized"" repairs or modifications.  FYI, this is actually illegal under the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act, bur no one is holding Tesla accountable.

If I buy a car, it is mine, to do whatever modifications or repairs I choose to do (within EPA and safety laws). Once the car is sold to the customer, the manufacturer's only role is to honor warranty work (if my modification caused the problem... then no warranty coverage).

Tesla claims when you ""hack"" your car to increase performance you are stealing from them and it's ""unsafe""... no I own the car, I can do what I want.  Tesla is not liable for my modifications and they can get there nose out of my business.  If want to ""chip"" or reprogram my Mustang to increase HP... Ford can't stop you (same for BMW).  If I reprogram my Tesla to increase HP... Tesla has no right to stop me, but they think they do.

If I break my Tesla due to my modifications, that is on me, no risk to Tesla.  In fact that is exactly what the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act says.

The agriculture industry is fighting the same attitude with John Deere right now.  As a result farmers are using hacked Russian software and firmware to do maintenace on their million dollar ag equipment because ""authorized"" repairs are expensive and take too long.

It's a dangerous precident ignoring the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act that needs to be stopped."
6/28/2021 12:33,stocks,"Yeah the next 10 years of EV domination was priced into Tesla in the last 2 years…at this point if they falter at all or other big OEMs start doing well IMO TSLA has nowhere to go but down.   

However I’m sure the cult will continue to be a cult and wallstreet will keep going completely disconnected from reality and TSLA will double again before long. Lol"
6/28/2021 15:36,stocks,"Wall Street pays for growth. Don't be like the Amazon bears who were making the same statements before Amazon hit scale and started reaping the benefits of their investments during their major growth phase. You're horizon is too short, Longterm TSLA is still undervalued if they continue to hit their targets. Their forward P/E is much much lower as they begin to capture more of the value of all the massive investments they've been making in recent years. This is why you see many price targets in excess of 1k.

Also you're not considering a lot of factors. Tesla captures more value in the value chain given they're more vertically integrated, so for instance they deliver direct to customers capturing the value dealerships take from traditional auto, you can buy auto insurance from Tesla (still expanding to new states/markets), you pay for charging at Tesla superchargers, Software options and the tremendous margins that come with them that no other traditional auto has currently. Tesla's value captured per vehicle sale is something other auto manufactures can only dream of.

Additionally look at the long term debt obligations of the traditional Autos compared to Tesla and traditional auto aren't growing, while they're losing their profitable ICE business to attempt to completely change their business plan to electric which isn't profitable for them and may never be. Without government support I see most traditional autos going bankrupt by the end of the decade given how difficult the transition will be. It's hard making a quick turn of direction for these massive manufacturers. The startups like Tesla, NIO, and others will have the edge starting from the ground up.

I've lived in Michigan almost my entire life, the home of big auto, my dad was an auto engineer for GM and also worked for suppliers to practically every major traditional auto. He's able to see the writing on the wall for traditional auto and he's been a Tesla investor even a bit before me back around 2016, and wouldn't touch a traditional auto stock with a 10 foot pole."

When I was in college, I was daytrading with a group of school students and was able to pull in $300 profit on some days while day-trading. Paying $5.99 every trade while daytrading isn't a smart thing to do. I use C.Shwabb now but use RobinHood for fun trades, still.

As for the 'selling data', honestly, this just stems from a narrative you're ignorantly using presumably from what you see other Redditors spamming during the GME debacle.

Citadel is a market maker. What that means is brokerage firms, such as RobinHood, sells their order flow to Citadel which in turn processes the trades for RobinHood. You mentioned Fidelity. You do realize Fidelity does the exact same thing as RobinHood, right? Fidelity and RobinHood are brokerage firms. They are not market makers. When you 'purchase' a share through them, they are simply acting as the intermediary.

You bring up RobinHood stopping the trade but Fidelity not stopping it. Do you know why? Because brokerage firms are required to have a certain amount of safety net $ in case the trade clears and RobinHood can't pay for it particularly when a stock is extremely volatile and some were using margin to fund these trades. Think of it as a down payment. The reason Fidelity didn't 'stop' the trade is because Fidelity has been around for a LOOOONG time. They had the sufficient $ to hold a safety net. RobinHood, being fairly new to the brokerage industry, didn't have that kind of capital which is why they had to borrow money in order to allow trading for certain stocks to resume. The reason people were allowed to sell is because when you push a sell order, you're getting the money. You don't need to 'promise' anything in return. Think of it as when you're buying a home. You might agree to buy a home for $500,000 but the bank wants you to pay the $100,000 down payment before they issue the loan. When you sell your stock, you don't need a 'down payment'. Someone pays for your share(s) and you get your money. Same concept with a home. You sell your home, you get your money. You don't have to pay a 'down payment' on the sale of a home.

This isn't anything new. What you're upset about has been how trades have been cleared for decades. Fidelity, E-Trade, WeBull, and RobinHood all use Citadel to push their orders... And they all profit from the order flow. If you don't believe me, check Fidelity's 606... they use Citadel for more than half of their orders."

I was wondering a bit more about the thesis for Fannie Mae ($FNMA) or the preferred stock.

What I believe/agree with the investors about:

\- The 30yr mortgage is a great aspect of American Home owning and Economy.

\- The recent Supreme Court Case did not *look* good for Fannie Mae with regards to the lawsuit.

\- The case however did seem to be instrumental in the independence away from the US Government.

But, for FNMA to succeed, the US Government would have to bring it out of conservatorship?  
Without the profits being paid as a dividend to the US Government, wouldn't it be one of the most profitable/largest financial institutions in the United States?

My Questions: What's the recommended investment for someone with my beliefs above? Preferred shares? Which ones? What're the differences? Why should I/not invest in it?

*Context: I'm a very long term investor seeing its recent struggles, and wondering if it's just a short term trap, or an actual opportunity*"
6/27/2021 20:23,stocks,"My initial thoughts on what the SCOTUS ruling means:

- Constitutional claim goes to the 5th circuit with a judge that has been notoriously unsympathetic to shareholders. To expect any monetary payback through the courts at this point is a reach
- This means that shareholders are likely at the mercy of the government, treasury, and FHFA on what happens to the GSEs.
- Two names mentioned earlier this year as potential replacements for FHFA directors were Mark Zandi and Susan Wachter. Both advocated moving the GSEs to a utility model, Wachter contributed to a piece on it in December. National Association of Realtors advocated it as well. Basically a utility model would let the GSEs still operate under government controls and would cap the returns that private investors could make but would allow for an infusion of private capital. In this scenario it's likely preferred shares would be built into the capital structure at par value and there would be a large common stock issuance. I have not seen much on what this would mean for legacy common share holders but my guess is it won't be good. The upside of a utility model is it gives a layer of protection for taxpayers right now if housing were to crash again, taxpayers will likely get hit with the brunt of the pain. Also, the infusion of capital can be used to push initiatives like affordable housing and also keep the GSEs dynamic and growing. 
- I do not believe the most recent sell-off is necessarily because people believe shares will be wiped out or that the GSEs will forever be under government control. The sell off is due to the likelihood of the net worth sweep being reimplemented and we're basically back to starting from scratch on the best path forward for the GSEs. I don't think people think they are worthless, I think people aren't willing to wait/think their money would be more productive elsewhere

So to answer your questions. I do think the plan is still to bring FNMA/FHLMC out of conservatorship and I think preferreds are the much better investment at this point. 

For commons, I think there are more scenarios that end badly than well. People love them because, unlike preferreds, they won't have a capped upside but short of full privatization and the government heavily writing down their senior preferred shares they will likely lose vs preferreds if not be wiped out entirely. For junior preferreds, it's really based on your patience level. It's been an acknowledge by many of years that leaving the GSEs in extended limbo is not the answer. I don't buy the ""Biden administration doesn't want to lose their cash cows"" theory people throw out there. There's more at stake here than just shareholders, but the companies themselves and how they operate as well as housing in general heavily hinge on what happens next. I believe this current administration will take actions to determine the best course of action for the GSEs long term.

For preferreds, $FNMAS is the mostly active series and $FNMAT is the most recent series. Here's a list of the series of them (gives the div rates, par values, and when they were issued):

https://www.fanniemae.com/about-us/investor-relations/stock-information

More recent issues on FHLMC/FNMA preferreds tend to trade higher for a couple of reasons. First, is they are just generally more active. Second, is if they are settled out the beliefs is more recent series could be paid out at a higher amount closer to par to account for previous dividends paid out (ie older series would have paid out more dividends over their life than newer).

Also, friendly reminder that these are about as risky and unknown of an investment out there. Don't invest more than you are willing to lose, the chance these can go to $0 is very real.

Edit: I'll just add one thought as well. I see a lot of people say it's too risky to pull the GSEs out of conservatorship especially with moratoriums ending and higher potential for default risk. I think it's too risky to fully privatize them like the previous administration was shooting for, but is it also very risky to leave them in conservatorship because right now taxpayers are at the most risk if we did have another housing collapse. That's why I am in support of the utility model or at least some variation of it because you protect taxpayers but maintain controls on the GSEs"
6/27/2021 20:30,stocks," for FNMA to succeed, the US Government would have to bring it out of conservatorship?

Yes. This is the only chance for big gains. Those profits need to be freed up instead of going to Uncle Sam. Otherwise there’s nothing much here. Could go to around $2.00 if it looks like the situation is going to change. But the reason things sold off is that could be another 4,8,12 years."

6/28/2021 0:00,stocks,"Leveraging portfolio… Another post on here was questioning general investment strategy and this brought the question of property into the equation, and it prompted me to get your views on this…

Property can be a great investment generating both capital growth and income. But it’s a pain in the arse. I’m in a senior position in a fairly substantial private property investment company, but I have no interest in owning buy to let property, despite doing this for a living.

I suspect people do it because they can put down a relatively small deposit, mortgage finance the remainder, acquire a substantial asset and watch it grow, whilst also receiving an income from rent.

My question is, why not do the same with equities?

Assuming I only invest in equities with a margin requirement of 25% then I can have a portfolio 4 x larger than I could otherwise have, and at a fairly low rate of interest, a rate comparable to buy to let mortgage rates.

Im mid thirties, have about £280k ($389k) free cash at the moment and most is invested in equities. I earn a decent salary and live fairly modestly, so a good chunk of future earnings can also be saved or invested. No large future expenses anticipated. Own my house in London (albeit with mortgage).

So why not treat equities like property, leverage it, and profit in the long run in a much more liquid market, with lower costs and less hassle than property.

Obviously everyone’s personal circumstances are different but I could definitely tie this money up for 10 years, so what good reasons are there not to do this. I am aware I need to leave a good chunk of cash free for any margin calls, particularly if the market tanks!"

6/28/2021 0:00,stocks,"World ETF or slice'n'dice? Hi all!

I have a larger pension from a previous job that I would like to invest long term in world ETFs. I would like my investment to be based on the ESG standards (ex China). I have 30+ years until retirement.

I currently see two options:

1. An easy solution where I pick a Developed markets ETF and an Emerging markets ETF (ex China) \~ 0.2 APR.
2. Construct the Developed markets part from four regional ETFs (USA, Europe, Japan, Pacific ex Japan) and again add Emerging markets \~ 0.1 APR.

A minor issue with option 2 is that Pacific ex Japan doesn't exist as ESG from iShares (where I intend to buy most of my portfolio), but it's only 4% of the market. I also haven't found the Emerging markets ex China as ESG.

Covering Developed markets with regional ETFs would save about 0,1% per annum, but I'm not sure it's worth the hassle. If, at some point, I have to sell part of my investment to pay my taxes from the earnings, or I want to change course a bit, then the allocation will either be skewed, or I'll have to pay extra in brokerage fees to keep the correct allocation between the regional ETFs.

Is it's cloud computing audience going to change? What about it's defense contract with the government? It's not over valued. It's undervalued and a great buy. I will keep buying and holding.

6/28/2021 9:29,stocks,"Costco is a great company with exceptional management.

With that said, it will likely return to 6-9% annual revenue growth it had in 2015 to 2019.  The revenue growth may even slow down a little because the pandemic carried forward its growth.  It's currently trading at 37 PE multiple, higher than WMT or TGT.  Its 34 forward PE is higher than most FAANG stocks.

I was very happy with my COST returns last year.  I also don't regret selling it last month."

6/28/2021 7:54,stocks,You've just listed a lot of things you like about the company and not mentioned the huge market cap and the high multiples it trades at. You have no basis to say its undervalued because everything you said would still apply if it had a 10T marketcap .

And believe it or not that’s their entire business. They like to say “crypto economy” company  like something big and vague and more diversified etc etc but really their business  is 97% exchange fees"

My feeling is that PEs and various other metrics are more important to money managers who are reviewed by their management quarterly and annually. For the regular Joe who wants retirement money, holding a huge most disrupting 1000P/E until the company grows into it's value will probably be better than running after Wall Street signals. Of course you don't keep the entire portfolio in stocks with 1000 P/E but it makes sense to pick a few and hold on for at least 10 years."

Why you say you thought they would Fall flat? What made you believe that?"
6/28/2021 9:35,stocks,"PE doesn't matter as much as PEG, and I don't necessarily agree with the popular narrative that Costco is done growing.  While pandemic may (or may not?) be ending, pandemic did Costco and other megaliths a favour by crushing the small players  even more.  Costco could have a lot of growth to come in international markets.  Costco is insanely anticipated in China.  As for the pandemic spike being a blip, Costco is habit-forming so the activity may persist."

6/28/2021 16:52,stocks,Definitely the plan. I am planning on holding for next 5-10 Years
6/27/2021 23:06,stocks,Interesting. An [article](https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.fool.com/amp/investing/2021/06/25/not-too-late-take-advantage-nvidias-stock-split/) mentioned you could still get in by the 19th.
6/27/2021 22:44,stocks,I was meaning that you can purchase shares post-split for a lower price so you can have more shares at a cheaper position.
6/28/2021 7:35,stocks,"Nope, you can buy any time and get it.  That date is for the brokers to worry about, not the shareholders.  Otherwise if you bought today and it split in 3 weeks, would your shares suddenly reduce in price and you lose a shitload of money?  Or would they have some shares worth more than others?  That logic makes no sense."
6/28/2021 8:23,stocks,"You can still get in through July something. Just woke up, not sourcing, but take my word for it"
6/28/2021 8:20,stocks,"Tip: Take a second to think about what you're about to post next time before you spread misinformation. 

Does it sound remotely reasonable to you that the millions of shares exchanged during that 1 month period are going to be just 25% of their initial value and the rest of their value gone? A bit of critical thinking doesn't hurt."
6/27/2021 23:00,stocks,Absolutely not what Nvidia was thinking.  They have a bright future and knew the stock was about to go towards 1000
6/28/2021 2:17,stocks,"> what do I like about them more than I did 12 months ago

They now have a sturdy foothold rather than an uncertain future and have established business partnerships to further that foothold.

From an objective point of view this is a pretty big reason in itself."
6/27/2021 22:59,stocks,hmmmm seems a tad high lol
6/28/2021 7:22,stocks,"That’s the P/E trailing 12months I believe, a good P/E to use is Forward P/E which for square is 114 which still make it hella overvalued lol"
6/28/2021 8:38,stocks,"True enough, I have decided that a bunch of companies like this warrant a small investment on my part, I won't ""buy the dip"" with them unless it falls more than 25% to average down. SQ is very interesting because their growth trajectory and capability to reduce growth spending if needed to lower PE I think masks alot of the apparent over pricing. 

Highly priced for sure but if they can continue strong track record I don't know that there will be significantly better entries anytime soon (it dipped to 200 recently but 🤷‍♂️"
6/27/2021 23:07,stocks,"OP — my apologies - I should have elaborated!! I work with a ton of small and medium sized owners at my 9-5. Those that use square hate it because the fees are really high. I hear that constantly. They appreciate the ease of it. Basically hook it into an iPad and wherever the iPad goes they have a walking cash register, even outside of their stores (think trade shows). However they all say the fees per transactions are nutty high. A few mentioned that they still pay fees on an item if it’s returned, double hit. Not sure if that’s accurate. Another question that I have  is are these fees normal? Maybe it feels high to them but it’s comparable to all of the other processors? Idk. Last comment is that they all say that can’t wait for the day that their operations are big enough so that they don’t need square anymore. I personally am not in sq. Disclaimer: I am in V and pypl because I believe in their products and I’m a more conservative investor. I will happily buy sq if their success continues over the next 5 years. They seem ripe for a major company to knock them off — like a chase, etc."

6/28/2021 9:55,stocks,Im afraid they are gonna bleed a lot of money on evs too. Its difficult to make evs while cashing in some profits. Even their ice cars have only 3% margin.
6/28/2021 8:50,stocks,"I would argue the unit volume share is largely irrelevant for these legacy automakers. As long as none of them can make EVs profitable, they will all be competing for market share until enough of them have gone out of business, and the only way to be the one that remains is to have a decent balance sheet."

But if you're in China you know that coffee is not a big part of the culture.  Brands, and especially western or luxury brands are.  Starbucks is a major brand, been there for years and seen as a luxury.  

Luckin's approach to offer cheaper products while rapidly opening up new stores was surely piling up the loses.  Yes, in a growing company this can be accepted, but not so much when the profit margin is thin.  The brand meanwhile is not considered luxury or premium.  Not a good thing in China"

6/28/2021 8:41,stocks,Squares fees are among the lowest in Canada. There are cheaper processors but most have monthly or annual costs that wipe out any savings until you hit extremely large volumes of sales. Square had many functionalities that are extremely helpful to small businesses too that don't require a trained administrator to figure out. Basically if you are a small business sq is your best friend. If you are a large business your bank's have better solutions.
6/27/2021 23:54,stocks,Sounds about right...I am very surprised there are not 10 square knock offs offering lower fees (maybe there are?)..I don't see a big moat here
6/28/2021 9:03,stocks,"I don’t pay attention to price targets because I don’t think they are very accurate with growth companies like these stocks. The company is executing well, revenue is growing, and the business makes sense in terms of being a modern company with room to grow. The company has a good reputation for its POS systems.

That's called SF buddy"
6/27/2021 23:53,stocks,"The issue I have is that you are creating a hierarchy of who deserves to afford a place to live and who doesn't. People love to randomly pick and choose who they want to scapegoat in the homelessness crisis. You get the people who say 'Oh, they're a bunch of drug addicts, they need be locked up.' or 'Oh they are a bunch of crazy people, they need to be committed.' or 'Oh, they are just a bunch of spoiled artists, they need to go home to mommy and daddy.' But the thing is, homeless isn't caused by a way a being - we have had insane people, drug addicts, and artists for as long as we've been human beings - but they thing is they could always afford a place to stay. Whether it was shitty SRO housing paid for by disability or if it was a weekly motel room paid for by addict private eyes people had places to live.

Now that housing is in such short supply and there are virtually no price controls or meaningful taxes on any aspect of the real estate market - those who are poor no longer have any place to go. Honestly, in some ways the homeless are smarter than those of use who rent - paying ridiculous rents every month that we could be spending on good times and creative endeavors. The problem is that homelessness inevitably leads to addiction, mental illness, and societal isolation - it goes from a life hack to an endless problem pretty quick.  

Anyways, I hope you see where I'm coming from. Even the reviled, self-centered artist deserves to be able to afford a place without having to give up their love of painting or whatever they like. If you don't agree, you can say goodbye to the few transcendent artists that would have emerged otherwise - but that might not be a big deal for you if you don't like strolling through the LACMA or the Getty or the Broad or whatever."
6/27/2021 23:34,stocks,"Yes, we are on the same page, but the homeless are such a diverse group - people *love* to pick the type of person they don't like and single them out as the problem. 'Oh, it's the self-serving artists' 'Oh, it's the unpredictable mentally ill' 'Oh, it's the criminal drug addicts'. It doesn't matter how you became homeless, the thing is you shouldn't have to be homeless. You should be able to be a drug addict, work odd jobs and afford a room somewhere (yes, this is how it used to be, people have always done drugs and most haven't been homeless). You should be able to paint all day and work odd jobs and afford a place to live (most artists have been poor or 'starving' and still afforded a place to live). You should even be able to be out of your mind - getting disability and *at least* have the reliability of your bed and shelter to come back to - only then can you think about getting treatment.

Anyway, I'm reacting to the arbitrary and inaccurate blame. Especially against 'artists' because people love to hate artists as if they don't also suffer from mental illness, drug addiction, or poverty (look up any of the great masters, they were likely crazy, on drugs, or living in poverty - they just weren't living on the streets because landlords didn't used to squeeze every dime from their tenants)."

6/27/2021 23:13,stocks,"1. Pick a stock. Get enough of it so you can start writing weeklies (probably a few hundred is where I like to start so fees don't kill your weekly profitability), monthlies, whatever premium is best for you.

2. If it goes up, you get exercised and win. You can re-buy back in at the elevated share price if you want, and restart your premium gathering again, OR shift the winnings over to another stock you like that is down currently. (It's more about booking premiums on plays like this. Your entry and exit points become less relevant if you're immediately buying back in as long as the price hasn't skyrocketed. If it goes back down after you get exercised you win twice. Great!)

3. If it goes down, as long as you believe in the fundamentals behind the stock, you can buy more, average down, and start new sub-positions. When I do this, I immediately write new CCs with the cheaper shares and track the premiums I earn vs. original share cost so I always know what my adjusted cost basis is. If it goes down further, you can buy back your original covered call and write a monthly to remain profitable.

Lots of plays here you can do. If you start to get a really big position you can hedge by buying puts so that if your stack value drops you win that way in return for a small portion of your premiums.

Does that help?

In addition, each night  the fund needs to rebalance to adjust for exposure.  An excerpt from the prospectus:

>Daily rebalancing and the compounding of each day’s return over time means that the return of the Fund for a period longer than a single day will be the result of each day’s returns compounded over the period, which will very likely differ in amount, and possibly even direction, from three times (3x) the return of the Index for the same period. The Fund will lose money if the Index’s performance is flat over time, and the Fund can lose money regardless of the performance of the Index, as a result of daily rebalancing, the Index’s volatility, compounding of each day’s return and other factors.

6/27/2021 21:36,stocks,I wasn’t making a prediction about the future. I was pointing out that the conditions that caused 2008 aren’t currently present.
6/28/2021 2:14,stocks,Past dividends doesnt either promise future dividens. A company who’s growing and expanding margins might have higher volatility but the risk is not higher compared to dividend companies. What does fomo have to do with this?

6/28/2021 5:17,stocks,"I'm not going to write down some DCF in here, it's pretty much all about how dumb and unrealistic the assumptions of some ""investors"" are. Gross Margins and ASP will be down significantly because new and old competitors are investing heavily into EVs. Their deliverys will be higher I'm sure, but it's unlikely that they will grow 90% p.a. for a decade straight like some of our moronic investors seem to think. I mean, it COULD happen? I guess? Why would I bet on it? Why would my investment thesis rely on the absolute most bullish case there could? Makes no sense. You should be more conservative with your assumptions so that you don't lose money in the worst case but make extraordinary returns in the best case. The price for which you buy a stock matters."
6/28/2021 8:19,stocks,I have a few ETFs and they don’t track the underlying indexes with 100% accuracy. So if the index goes up 2.3% the etf may only do 2.2%. Also some ETFs have combination of funds of funds. In essence they are ETFs of ETFs. This begs the questions of how they track the expense ratio of these ETFs. So they may not track exactly and return a lesser amount.

6/28/2021 9:17,stocks,"Gross margins will increase as manufacturing continues to get better (giga press / die casting), 4680 cells come online, more capacity in the factories will be used. Excluding regulatory credits, gross margins are around 22% IIRC. GM has 5% and Ford has a 4% gross margin on ICE vehicles. They're not coming anywhere close to those numbers on EVs anytime soon let alone 22% that Tesla already has using Fremont (v0 factory). Berlin and Austin are v2 factories, they'll have even more efficiencies.

This is my prediction for production over the next few years

Year	Car sales

	  
2021	860000	

  
2022	1490000	73% y/y bc Berlin, Austin, EV Credits

  
2023	2235000	50% y/y  


2024	3352500	50% y/y  


2025	5,028,750	50% y/y

Assuming gross margin will be around 25% by 2025 (conservative IMO)

5M \* 45k ASP \* .25 = $56B gross profit.If you look at the financials, Operating Expenses scaled linearly during model 3 ramp despite production becoming exponential. Operating exp was 4.6B in 2020. Lets say it triples by 2025 to 13.8B.

Operating profit = 56B - 13.8B = 42.2 \* 30 P/E = 1.27T on the automobile business.

&#x200B;

This is \*WITHOUT\* accounting for the energy business or radical FSD improvement / robotaxis. I give it a generous 30 P/E using these guidelines:

10 P/E - applied to flat/stable businesses

20 p/e - given to business growing 5-10% y/y

30 p/e - given to businesses growing 20-25 % y/y"

 1) define what “good” means to you, in writing, and present it to multiple PMs.

The best way I’ve found is “I need $x per month, if you can rent it for $y, keep the spread and because I’m being cool like that if you can’t fill the property for a month then I’m deducting the mortgage from the year’s payment.” I’ve had a ton of folks tell me no, but the two that said yep worked harder than all of them probably would have... because you know... they have an incentive to do so.

6/28/2021 11:01,stocks,"Their revenue growth has been decreasing continiously for the last 10 years so I don't know why you would assume 73% and 4 times 50% yoy growth in car sales. Their revenues grew by about 38% in the last year, not to mention that the car industry is a cyclical business, which is why their growth rates aren't sustainable, at least not in the car manufacturing space. Your gross margins are ridiculously high for the car industry. I'd go with 15% at the most, especially considering how incredibly competitive the car industry is. You should also take into account all of the problems Tesla is currently having in Berlin, I don't know about other places. Giving a company of that size a P/E ratio of 30 is way too high, again ESPECIALLY for the car industry, which is a cyclical business. I'd go with 20 at the most for the car industry and keep in mind that a mature car company like Volkswagen that is also heavily investing into FSD and EVs, a company that is already selling 10M cars annually, is trading at a P/E of 10. Your ASP is way too high in my opinion. You won't sell that many cars and also have an average price as high as that. 35K and less makes way more sense for the future. The ID.3 from Volkswagen is already selling for 30K. Most people won't even buy cars that expensive, they'd rather buy older models for less money than new models just because they're ""new"".  


If we go with 30% growth in the next 5 years, 15% Margin, an ASP of 30K and a P/E of 20:  


4.5M\*30k ASP\*0,15= $20B in GP (less than half of what you were saying)  


I'll just assume lower costs than you to be charitable and go with 10B, but they'll essentially have the same cost in general, just not the same margins or the market share you were thinking about.  


Leaves us with 10B OP  


\*20 P/E equals 200B on the automobile business IN 5 YEARS. Volkswagen has a market cap of 127B Dollars with a P/E of about 10 and they're not only heavily investing into EVs and FSD, but they're also not diluting the hell out of you.  


Discount that by 10% for every year because that's our expected annual return.  


200B / (1,1\*4) = \~45B

Leaves us with a market cap of 45B Dollars today, just for the auto business. Now, let's be real. Even if all other divisions are growing at an incredibly fast pace and we somehow just come up with literally 5 times the valuation of their car business (which is...what they are...a car company. Most of their revenues come from cars, not to mention the ridicioulous assumption that Tesla will be as big as GEICO in the car insurance space in about 5 years but that's another topic), they'd still be overvalued by about 100%. They would literally have to fall by another 50% for me to even look in the direction of this company, assuming that they're going to have incredible growth and profits from their other divisions.  


By the way, all of this doesn't even take dilution into account. I mean, if you feel comfortable paying that much for Tesla, go on and do it. I don't think your assumptions are realistic to be honest. But I really hope that your investment works out for you, it's just not something for me. I'd rather go with conservative assumptions and not lose any money in the (realistic) worst case scenario. It's how Buffett made his fortune. I was very surprised and happy to see any numbers at all, usually people just insult me, so this was quite nice to look at. Thanks for that I guess."

6/28/2021 11:53,stocks,"Dividends are glorified by people about to retire and want a steady income stream. But I was arguing that you shouldn’t just focus on ROI but intrinsic values of individual stock and overall market sentiments. A lot of stocks with high ROI recently tend to be overpriced.

6/28/2021 13:35,stocks,">Their revenue growth has been decreasing continiously for the last 10 years so I don't know why you would assume 73% and 4 times 50% yoy growth in car sales

Because the Austin/Berlin factories are coming online. IIRC Austin can fit the Fremont, Berlin, and China factory inside of it. It is massive. EV adoption is being accelerated by governments. I am betting on the U.S. implementing a $10k EV Tax credit which will sky rocket demand.   


\>Your gross margins are ridiculously high for the car industry.  
Looking at tesla's financial sheet from last few quarters, you'll see an automotive gross margin around 22% excluding EV credits. Im not making these numbers up, just reading the information presented.   


\>Giving a company of that size a P/E ratio of 30 is way too high, again ESPECIALLY for the car industry, which is a cyclical business

GOOG, AMZN, FB all have P/Es \~30+ and they're much larger in size. Also, it is native to think PEs aren't assigned by industry. They're assigned by future growth potential. It is a premium investors are willing to pay for that future growth.   


\>I was very surprised and happy to see any numbers at all, usually people just insult me, so this was quite nice to look at. Thanks for that I guess.

6/28/2021 10:12,stocks,"I bet that’s it: dividends

6/28/2021 13:25,stocks,"Now i see where you’re coming from. I meant total ROI in the portfolio rather than cashflow every month. Timing the market is hard, so is determining the intrinsic value since we all have our own narratives. Best of luck and thanks for the discussion!"
6/28/2021 8:27,stocks,The price I'm willing to buy a security at is my price target? LOL
6/28/2021 14:31,stocks,"1. Just because production capacity is increasing doesn't mean that revenues will increase just as much, naive assumption imo.

2. Yes, and with margins like that competition will come faster than you think. Why would you assume margins of 25% if they're at 22% right now? It's pretty much safe to assume that their margins will decrease. Everyone and their mothers are creating EV companies right now. It's one issue that I very specifically have an issue with.

3. If we only look at Tesla as a car company, which I thought we were doing in this hypothetical case, you're just not going to have a PE of 30. I was being nice with a PE of 20. At 5M cars sold annually you'd usually not grow as fast/as much anymore. Tesla would be a mature company at that point, so even a PE of 20 is a little too high in my opinion (!If we only value it as a car company, which I thought we were doing here?).

4. It's okay to pay more for growth, it makes sense. But it doesn't make sense to overpay for growth. I think that that's exactly what's going on with Tesla. There are many phantasies around what Tesla could maybe do. I usually hear people talk about what they think is possible, rather than what they think is probable. My conservative assumptions led to a fair value of about $45B today, just for the car company. Their car sales make up about 86% of their revenues. Even if I assume that all other divisions of their business is going to take off and the revenue from cars is only going to make up about 20% of their business, assuming similar margins, they'd be worth about $250B today. It's a ridiculous assumption and still not enough to justify their current valuation. They'd have to fall by about 66%, and even then it's difficult to justify their valuation because some of the divisions that people are talking about won't even exist in 5 years, let alone some of the assumptions about them getting into the car insurance business (there are some morons who expect Tesla to control 15% of the car insurance market in 2025, give me a break).

Additionally, considering how much dilution there is in Teslas stock, I personally wouldn't pay more than $50 for the stock today. And please, NEVER underestimate Dilution. I think that buying Tesla at a market cap of $650B !TODAY!, considering all the risks, is way too much. You're just overpaying for growth at this point, there are much better opportunities out there."
6/27/2021 21:39,stocks,"But what makes the stock valuable to the next guy?

  4) The stock could increase and the next guy can profit."
6/28/2021 8:02,stocks,Thing is if you are equally wrong about the growth rates for all the companies you look at then your ranking of stocks would be still useful if you choose the ones you measure as undervalued even if you overvalue all of them with exorbitant growth rates. Also using different scenarios can be useful for this and if things look good with your worst case scenario growth rates then it’s probably a decent investment!
6/28/2021 4:14,stocks,"because the growth rate is exponential, a slight difference will give a significant deviation. The probability of assumption multiply with assumption brings down to zero...the law of probability."

Shorts have a function, they help to expose fraud, and they are useful contributors to the popular vote on what a security should be priced.

But a good slice of the retail crowd doesn’t like fraud to be exposed, doesn’t like stocks to be fairly priced, because this conflicts with their goal of flipping them a week later at 10x the price, or even better 1000x, to fleece some sucker as much as possible, scruples be damned.

It’s would be amusing if AMC ever reached $1000 a share and then turned out ownership has become 100% retail investors, 0% shorts. And the business continues to bleed money.

It’s funny because in some cases selling stock to retail investors seems to have become the business plan.

6/28/2021 9:07,stocks,"Okay you do have a point there.

A newer company might need to make a stock offering to pay down debt and improve their balance sheet. Then again, newer companies don't generally pay a dividend.

I would argue that a business with good fundamentals wouldn't need to make a stock offering, but this isn't always the case. 

I still see dividend paying stocks as less volatile since the price of the underlying is anchored to some percentage of the company profits paid out as dividends."
6/28/2021 10:44,stocks,">I would argue that a business with good fundamentals wouldn't need to make a stock offering, but this isn't always the case. 

That is the case for any solid company,  regardless of if they pay a dividend or not. 


>I still see dividend paying stocks as less volatile since the price of the underlying is anchored to some percentage of the company profits paid out as dividends.

I still strongly disagree.   A stable dividend over a long period of time spanning several recessions  (i.e. dividend aristocrat) is a sign of a stable company.   The mere existence of a  dividend doesn't offer the same guarantee of stability.  It may also indicate a company or industry that is on the decline (tobacco, oil,  etc).  Those companies offer a good dividend because it's the only thing they can do.   They don't have room to grow, and the dividend is their only way to attract shareholders despite receding profits. 

There are also plenty of high yield dividends that are not sustainable based on the company's current operating income.   It may be financed by cheap debt.   Those companies will slash their dividend at the next economic downturn,  and the share price will tank because it was the only reason to invest in the company."
6/28/2021 15:35,stocks,"> That is the case for any solid company regardless of if they pay a dividend or not

Yep I agree. And that is why a companies stock price does not affect their ability to raise capital if they are financially healthy.

> The existence of a dividend does not offer the same guarantee of stability

Well yea of course not. I wasn't saying all companies with dividend are safe. Just that companies with a dividend have SOMETHING to stop the stock from dropping 95% if investors ever realize they are buying fairy dust when they buy a stock ticker.

While both dividend stocks and non-divide.d stocks can sell off at any time, of a dividend stock sells of by 95% and the fundamentals haven't changed, that stock now has a divide.d yield of 20x. Which means a dividend paying stock with solid fu damentals WONT sell of 95% because there will be support from people buying the cheap dividend.

If Tesla sells of 95% due to ""profit taking"" with no change in fundamentals, no one will buy that stock. Except for investors who believe that someone else will buy their tesla stock at a higher price later.

Dividends give price support to companies with good fundamentals. Stocks with no dividends have nothing to support the price, regardless of how healthy the company is.

> the share price will tank because it was the only reason to invest in the company

There are two reasons to ever invest in a company. Returns via dividend or returns via appreciation in equity. We've beaten the dividend horse to death at this point, and appreciation in equity really just means ""someone else will buy my shares for more than I paid for them sometime in the future.""

It's not about ""owning the underlying company"" if I buy $80,000 worth of TSLA shares I cannot just show up to the tesla factory and trade my shares for a new tsla. I don't own anything. Figuratively speaking I own equity in the company. Literally, I own nothing. 

If my stock does not pay a dividend I just have to hope that through news events and price speculation the market decides my shares are worth more over time.

If my stock does pay a dividend, and the compa y grows, and the divide.d grows, natural price discovery will appreciate the value of the underlying stock as the dividend grows over time.

If the company doesn't pay a dividend, the market can ""decide"" at any time to sell off. Kindof the way tsla sold off from $975 to $600 this year. If TSLA payed a dividend, there probably would have been price support somewhere before TSLA was able to hit $600."

Growth stocks have had quite a run recently, so many of them aren't going to have massive room to run more unless valuations just go a bit crazy.  

Bank stocks have been a bit beaten down in the last 3 weeks (5-8% down from recent peaks for most).  They could be a good play with some positive headwinds surrounding the lifting of regulations on their capital on June 30th.  Most pay a good 2-4% dividend - if you ended up in Feb with 7% growth plus 3 q's of dividends, that'd be a pretty solid win short term. 

Industrials like CAT and DE are down a bit but have bounced off a local low about a week and a half ago.  They could have some good momentum IF the usd continues to strengthen against foreign currency.  

I could see any 3 of these sectors being +8 to 10 percent by next year, but also any could be down just as much or more if things don't play out well for them.  

I'm not going to make any specific recommendations because I don't know any more than anyone else with google, but that would be a good way to think about it - pick a sector or two that you think market conditions favor over the next year and look for companies that aren't overextended."

They just improved guidance for this quarter a couple of weeks ago, so if they do it again during the earnings call and the ttm P/E drops beneath 25 I could see it going all the way back to the $95 resistance."
6/28/2021 16:52,stocks,"I have 7/16 80.5 calls, where do you think I sell them at?"
6/28/2021 3:49,stocks,"wow, that's really cool. You must be at least halfway to becoming a millionaire with 35 shares! Congrats buddy"
6/28/2021 4:00,stocks,"Are you short Tesla? If you aren't, your targets don't make sense. Anyone can give any price target. If you are so confident about your valuation, short the stock. At Friday's close, you can make $600 per share...good luck"
6/28/2021 4:05,stocks,Could you name some? I'll do my analysis and buy if I like them.
6/28/2021 8:29,stocks,"I mean $24,000 in Tesla before turning 25 is pretty good and above average I'd say."
6/28/2021 11:28,stocks,"AMD, NIO or PLTR.

AMD is highly undervalued and over 14 Analysts out of 19 have given Avg price of $106.

TESLA is in risky territory. If u want to play safe. Diversify in AMD, NIO amd PLTR. Maybe TESLA also if u want, I do not expect TESLA to 2x-3x due to its PE already over 600.

But other stocks like AMD are at PE of 20 now.

BTW I own NIO, AMD, TESLA, PLTR .. all. I expect NIO, AMD , PLTR and then TESLA in order of stock price growth.

Have been in stocks from last 7 yrs with a 7 digit portfolio so I know what I am talking about."
6/28/2021 9:57,stocks,Yes it is
6/28/2021 12:02,stocks,"I'm holding AMD too, exited NIO and PLTR sometime back. Thanks for the tip, looking to re-enter in NIO"
6/27/2021 21:09,stocks,Must be nice to live in that binary head of yours to keep things simple and yet so wrong. Since when is investing in Tesla since 2018 being a bagholder?

6/27/2021 20:05,stocks,"The lesson for investors, Buffett says, is that you don't have to swing at every pitch. “The trick in investing is just to sit there and watch pitch after pitch go by and wait for the one right in your sweet spot. And if people are yelling, 'Swing, you bum!,' ignore them.”

&#x200B;

I stop fomo'ing after i really practice this with discipline. You could be right in terms of the company's future. Literally everyone knows NVDA is heading to the right direction, but is it worth taking the risk when its trading at 90 times? The problem is there is way too many opportunities on the market, and it was obvious the recent surge was due to the stock split. A stock split does nothing to the company's earning performance, and people are buying because stock would become ""cheaper"". Stock is deemed to drop back to its average 40-60 historical PE, which is at least 600. In the mean time, you can look for other buying opportunity."
6/27/2021 22:53,stocks,"I sold all my NVDA Friday. Over 90 PE was to much for me.

I bought to hold for the split, but I’m happy to get my 30% and get out."
6/27/2021 20:18,stocks,Thanks a lot. I should definitely practice discipline
6/28/2021 9:13,stocks,"silly question how else would you buy stocks if not through a brokerage?  

on another note this is good to know, I am tempted to get in NVDA, and wanted to get in before split but think it is running too high right now and will drop right before or after split but I don't know"

Great pun.

I've scoured their S-1 and some other press releases and **it looks like KK is bullish on growing Insomnia**. I did some back of the envelope calcs here:

Insomnia had 54% of 2020 revenue come from e-commerce. KK had 18%.

We don't know how big Insomnia's revenue is (from S-1: ""\[KK\] consolidates the financial results of Insomnia""), so some back of the envelope math will do:

* Insomnia sold 65 million cookies in 2020. KK sold 1.3B donuts, or about 20x the donuts vs cookies.
* However, Insomnia charges $21 for a basic dozen cookies, vs $7.99 for a dozen at KK. We'll call this 3x the price for easy math.
* 20 / 3 = KK has \~6.7x more revenue than Insomnia, or 13% of revenue is Insomnia.
* I think this is a low estimate because it doesn't take delivery or shipping revenue into account, so let's say that Insomonia Cookies are \~15% of $DNUT revenue.

Why is this important ? Because Insomnia Cookies appear to be their growth engine! From their pre-IPO press release:

Insomnia Cookies opened 17 locations in 2020 and has plans to open 30 stores in 2021. The company locations offer delivery up to 30 minutes. The company plans to offer next-day delivery in the future, covering a larger percentage of the U.S. market.

e-Commerce capabilities also give a company ability to drive lower margins than 100% traditional brick and mortar. And with KK is investing heavily into their most e-Commerce heavy, growing brand (Insomnia Cookies), this could help potentially growth *both* their revenue growth and bottom-line performance.

**TL;DR**: Buy the DNUT, get the cookie.

6/28/2021 11:56,stocks,"I saw a option alert today for 276 puts with a strike price of 180.00 Jan 21 2022, 

 ive been bullish on baba for a while as well so I'm curious what you think would motivate this kind of option activity"
6/28/2021 12:34,stocks,"Legit question, but there's plenty of orders in the flow, to understand each is impossible. Try reading all of them together, like a map.
Today options statistics are(so far): 192k calls vs. 47k puts. P/c ratio is 0.246.
I found like 3 orders on the options today which were around 5.4 million each.(calls) and a few 1-2m on puts.
So again, options activity is nice and smart to monitor, but one order alone tells nothing."
6/28/2021 13:46,stocks,Why are regeron and bmy so undervalued in your opinion?
6/28/2021 13:46,stocks,"$10 bucks you thought you were seeing a doctor but were seeing a midlevel. They’re cheap labor, patients don’t know, and they maximize profits for these corps at the cost of patients"
6/28/2021 13:39,stocks,What does that mean for someone thinking of investing? I’d heard splits are meaningless but do help young money get in
6/28/2021 19:39,stocks,I did think I was seeing a DR but have no idea who I actually spoke with. Also cost me 65 bucks haha
6/28/2021 15:32,stocks,It means that this company is headed in the right direction and share price is likely to continue to appreciate and outpace its peers. Constantly beating expectations and growing faster than most analysts are expecting.

6/27/2021 20:47,stocks,"Citadel gave them $2 billion. Why would Melvin beg Citadel for that money if it wasn't losing money buying shares to cover the shorts?

Melvin reports it has covered. FINRA, the SEC, and Congress have all investigated. None of them are indicting or fining Melvin for lying to the market.

There's no there, there. And a bunch of muppets on Reddit playing epistemological games won't change that."
6/28/2021 4:00,stocks,"Yeah I know, which is why I'm confused that you were comparing gold to it. Wouldn't you want to compare against an asset that does well in inflation?"
6/28/2021 14:42,stocks,I got in at 15$ last year. Still holding them. Seems like a good long term investment to me. If hydrogen gets cheaper then Plug will be a profitable company by a good margin.
