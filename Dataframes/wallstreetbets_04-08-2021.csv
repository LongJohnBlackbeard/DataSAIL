2021-04-08 19:34:41,wallstreetbets,This is very accurate forecast
2021-04-08 19:37:42,wallstreetbets,I want to believe but I've been hurt so many times. I'm the abused one in the relationship that keeps taking PLTR back after it pummels me day in day out. It keeps promising it will change and goes up 5% sometimes to show it really cares about me then the next day it turns on me in a heartbeat
2021-04-08 19:40:15,wallstreetbets,"good luck

!Remindme 6 days"
2021-04-08 19:40:34,wallstreetbets,Weren't you the retard whose positions expire tomorrow? At least the ones you posted.
2021-04-08 19:42:29,wallstreetbets,"I closed my calls out for this very reason.  I expect to be able to sell them at a much higher strike soon.  I did not want to lose my shares.

Most of my PLTR position is in 45 strike long dated puts, though.

I imagine next week will be a crazy bump, even if it peters out soon after."
2021-04-08 19:42:57,wallstreetbets,"I know this will get downvoted,  but the company is worth 40b which is 10x their projected sales in 2025 of 4b. Which is also based on perfect execution of 30% compounded annual growth. Every dollar of the share price is 1 billion dollars of value.  Why do pltr investors think the stock is going to take off in days or even weeks? I heard them all complain Monday that they only gained 1% on the 89 million dollar contract.  1% was around 700 million dollars of value,  why would a 89 million dollar contract add any more than that? We know they're going to land contracts. It's the only way to even keep up with their 30% growth projection..... so now we come to demo day,  why do the investors think this will fly after the demo? Is a demo going to add billions of market cap to a company? If so,  should I just buy a 200m dollar company and when they do a presentation I get 4x my money right?"
2021-04-08 19:43:05,wallstreetbets,"Hate to burst your bubble here......

Descending triangles mean the stock is going to go down. 

So, let‚Äôs see here..... consistently lower lows and lower highs. Yep. I see it now..... I‚Äôm buying puts. Especially since it went up today I can totally see buyers jumping on and panic selling the dips. I taste the chicken tendies already."

Instead of just watching your favorite teams or the ‚Äòbig‚Äô games, any game will make your pp tingle when you got money on the line. Sportsbetting even makes watching baseball fun.

Fucking ridiculous how much lower FUBO‚Äôs market cap is compared to DKNG. DFS is fucking boring as shit, and yes Im aware they have their own book open in some states. Imagine how cool it would be to have a sportsbook integrated with their streaming apps. Could easily make pregame/live bets on your TV, see alerts when a bet is close to a hitting and be able to open up the stream next to your current game, etc. Possibilities are endless."

2021-04-08 18:28:14,wallstreetbets,"Ok but there are completely different dynamics at play now.  The whole game is different and the short interest is not going to bankrupt anybody anymore.

The stretch from 180$ to 420$ and even 900 is absolutely unrealistic without conceited short squeeze effort by a ton of extremely rich players now

WSB didn‚Äôt even completely squeeze GME the first time, it was people like Chamath who tweeted about their 115$ calls, that moment was a huge catalyst and I guarantee no rich fucks are playing with GME anymore, at least not in a significant way

The price might hit 420 in another squeeze, for like a day, but 900 is a total retard dream"
2021-04-08 19:09:10,wallstreetbets,It doesn't have to hit those prices to profit.  It just needs nice violent swings up every once in a while.
2021-04-08 18:34:53,wallstreetbets,Idk imagine if aside from switching to eComm they also did a combination of reverse split and a series of buybacks. I think you'd find yourself in a pretty nice pickle. But that's too wild right not that anything as wild happened with this company so far... Good luck though you're a brother ape for sure ‚úäü¶ç‚úäü¶ç
2021-04-08 19:12:07,wallstreetbets,"Yeah true but every day it doesn‚Äôt do that the theta and IV crush will get worse and worse, 

you‚Äôre better off swinging weeklies for a couple days than attempting some stupid long term strategy with funny numbers, if it‚Äôs a gamble then you can‚Äôt possibly have a long term strategy like OP, so he has more of a disadvantage using his ‚Äòstrategy‚Äô 

OP‚Äôs strategy is terrible and has been tried for a loss plenty of times since January, you think nobody was stupid enough to lose money on 420$ calls yet?  I know I lost money on some retarded GME calls, and you‚Äôre lying if you haven‚Äôt lost on GME calls..  

so again it‚Äôs better off to swing a 420$ Weekly..  rather than attempt to hold through the theta and IV burn on a longer dated option,"
2021-04-08 19:12:00,wallstreetbets,"Say it hits $300 in mid May, he would profit $15k.  Or $250 by mid June would even be about +$5k"
2021-04-08 19:16:33,wallstreetbets,"I agree... Its just people knocking it.  This is Wallstreetbets.  Not lets play safe.  Deep OTM calls can generate cash.  $GME is the unknown.  It could do whatever it wants, whenever it wants, with or with out a catalyst.  I love the bet.  But im not no bitch either.  This gives me wood"

2021-04-08 18:06:07,wallstreetbets,"Just bought into APHA & TLRY ahead of APHA's earnings next week (on Monday). I anticipate a record quarter as revenues and income from Sweetwater Brewing will start to reflect. Plus both companies are set to merge in a few weeks!! From a technical aspect, these stock have been in consolidation for a while now, APHA seems to have formed a bull pennant and the volume has REALLY thinned out (I ignored the fall over the last few days, as I feel that was due to these hedge funds heavily shorting these stocks so that they could then buy at the levels we saw yesterday and today). I expect a break on the upside for these 2 stocks, with the earnings report and positivity ahead of the merger acting as catalysts."

2021-04-08 18:13:00,wallstreetbets,I will post an update whether gains or loss porn. But I'm 100% sure about this.
2021-04-08 18:32:33,wallstreetbets,Best Comment Yet!
2021-04-08 18:21:23,wallstreetbets,Haha yeah next 1 day lol that's a yolo
2021-04-08 18:39:47,wallstreetbets,You make a very valid point.
2021-04-08 18:14:07,wallstreetbets,I meant trading days. Or next week but I cant change the title I dont think.
2021-04-08 18:25:52,wallstreetbets,Lol I meant 3 trading days but yes I've got hella 4-16 and further calls too.
2021-04-08 18:56:27,wallstreetbets,Ive posted my DD in the comments. I hate that I cant post text to a picture on the post so now I have to keep repeating myself.
2021-04-08 18:17:57,wallstreetbets,"I love working options that way. Buy an even number of contracts, sell half if they double and let the rest ride."
2021-04-08 18:35:26,wallstreetbets,I am shooting for next week. Only 5K in Tomorrow Lotto Calls and most are profitable or breakeven and I made enough profit today to pay for the lotto calls. The rest are further out.
2021-04-08 19:32:31,wallstreetbets,Why is that?
2021-04-08 18:49:19,wallstreetbets,Hello bot remind me on Monday please. Thanks not remindme! 4 days
2021-04-08 18:19:30,wallstreetbets,Well... since you so confident....I‚Äôm in. I have a lot of shares... about to buy hella calls...
2021-04-08 18:21:48,wallstreetbets,"4/09 is tomorrow though so wouldn't it be one day? 

Or you bought them 2 days ago?"
2021-04-08 18:58:33,wallstreetbets,Me too I also like buying calls and puts at the same time. Stonks only move 2 directions.
2021-04-08 19:31:58,wallstreetbets,Why the fuck does the title say 39k them?
2021-04-08 18:23:58,wallstreetbets,I'm expecting a morning pop and drop like normal. But watch the volume. And watch key levels. We've tested support at 22.76 twice and it rejected it. It may test once more but who's really selling 4 days before a major catalyst at nearly 50% lows.
2021-04-08 18:37:25,wallstreetbets,I've got about 300 calls further out. The 4/9's are just from some of the profits I took today.
2021-04-08 18:48:02,wallstreetbets,I got ya now. I'm balls deep in PLTR calls too bro see you on the moon soon enough

2021-04-08 17:44:25,wallstreetbets,I pretty much had the exact same position as you. Made 1200% on my 30c for ASO. Still have my 35c and shares. I like the stock.

2021-04-08 17:08:25,wallstreetbets,Still have e a chance
2021-04-08 17:18:44,wallstreetbets,You are worse off than me. I‚Äôve got $5 NOK calls for October 15. Only paid $.035 per contract

you people are hilarious"
2021-04-08 17:47:39,wallstreetbets,"One of the most talked about, yet most disappointing stocks of the past year. 

List looks something like:

* NOK

* ERIC (also for the dumb 5G play)

* PLTR (except for that one glorious week)
* RKT (except for that one glorious day)
* UWMC

What other ones am I missing?"
2021-04-08 18:05:24,wallstreetbets,"Average down to a lower number or $11 if you have cash. Sell the amount that you bought for a small profit to get back what u just spent .  Wait to see if it'll go up. 

*When you buying option, make sure you have enough capital to average down. * Learn about the Greek(Theta etc.....

Pltr almost drained my account. if I did not have enough fund to average down, I would have been f**. The next day I sold at 118% profit. 

U need funds to trade volatile stocksüëà"

2021-04-08 17:58:10,wallstreetbets,You forgot Egyptian Easter rabbits heading to France through the Suez Canal.
2021-04-08 18:29:53,wallstreetbets,Good additions. I never really kept an eye on PRPL. Didn‚Äôt a guy make millions on it though?

Meeting is now June 9, so 60 days before is April 10.

My hope is that the Cohen announcement today is to get the big boys prepped so they aren't blindsided by the recall on ~~Monday~~ Saturday."

2021-04-08 18:34:09,wallstreetbets,You answer your own question.  Your original reason for buying was that you thought when Covid ends that people would go back to theaters.  Well Covid isn‚Äôt over yet and there haven‚Äôt been many movies to get people back.  You‚Äôll be kicking your own but if that happens the exact way you thought it would and you are no longer holding.  You‚Äôll say that you were smart enough but not brave enough.  For that reason I wouldn‚Äôt sell.  Maybe I‚Äôd unload a third of it to have some more guaranteed profit but no more than that.
2021-04-08 18:54:18,wallstreetbets,Sell the equity and buy the debt.

2021-04-08 17:46:03,wallstreetbets,Sell. It‚Äôs dead money. Put it to use in a company that actually has growth in its future. AMC was a garbage company before covid. It‚Äôs worse now.
2021-04-08 18:32:29,wallstreetbets,"I LOVE the local AMC. The chairs are awesome and it was always a treat to go there when they were open. I wanted the company to survive and when I think it's safe, I'd love to go back and see a film with my wife and her boyfriend. 

However, executive leadership rewarding themselves with bonuses and selling at >10 was the tipping point for me. I no longer see a future for this company. I sold for a small profit and started buying puts."
2021-04-08 17:02:41,wallstreetbets,"Imagine pre covid. Dwindling in person attendance at movie theatres making it difficult for AMC and similar to operate. 

Now imagine post covid. Less people attending in person because of worries about germs, likely more expensive which is ridiculous, easier to watch movies in the comfort of your home, etc. 

The writing is on the wall. I get it, people liked going to movies as a kid and they like the stock because of that. That ain‚Äôt enough in today‚Äôs world. 

Like I said, the writing is on the wall if AMC doesn‚Äôt significantly change their business model for the changing times."
2021-04-08 17:25:41,wallstreetbets,"I'm gonna sum up my thought process and TLDR this shit. Keep in mind I have puts on the short term but plan on buying back in when it gets low again and holding for 5 years. 

If youre still in for the squeeze you may need a helmet to go outside. 

If you think AMC is magically gonna do better post covid after a dilution. Especially if the second vote goes through. With also no revenue for a year due to corona. I  got magic beans to sell you. 

If the vote passes to dilute. Your shares will lose half of their already halved value. AMC would probably go to less than 4$. Mind you they probably won't dilute for a year IF they even do dilute. But the vote passing is gonna hurt anyone still thinking its gonna squeeze. I feel the need to say that. Just cause it passes doesn't mean they will dilute again. I'm just saying they probably will because it would help the company financially.  


If the vote doesn't pass. We'll thats kinda fucking over AMC because it cuts off a way for them to get money.  

AMC has been in a decline in the last 5 years. Squeeze sentiment has propped it up but you can see it slowly dwindle down again. 

Theaters getting filled right now is not indicative of their financial situation.

AMC has disconnected from GME. The sentiment has been dying on Wall Street bets for AMC.

People compare AMC to CNK as to where the price should be but completely ignore fundamentals.  

Honestly though if you got in at 2$. Just set a stop loss around where you're happy. Check my profile I did kinda the same thing. What I've been doing is buying dips and selling at the tops.

The people voting no to dilute don't give two shits about AMC. They're here for the quick buck. So why should AMC give a shit about them."
2021-04-08 19:25:44,wallstreetbets,Sell.  Any time the stock pokes its head up the company will just dilute.  They're farming moronic retail investors for cash.
2021-04-08 18:26:23,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, I sold. It's had some action, I gained in the double digit percents, but upcoming corporate moves made staying on-board unattractive. I no longer like the stock.
The likelihood of AMC mooning is slim, based on what I've been able to gather. For me, then, it was time. I had fun. I learned something.
Now I'm jumping into other tickers with better-looking up-comings.

Good luck!"
2021-04-08 17:00:26,wallstreetbets,I like going to the movies. Don‚Äôt you?
2021-04-08 17:17:42,wallstreetbets,I bought 10000 in Jan at 4.75. Sold some CCs through the Feb slump and then sold half my shares to cover my costs when it went back up. Sold my final 5000 this week when it went up to 11. Just saying.
2021-04-08 17:02:20,wallstreetbets,"Sell, the movie business was dying prior to covid, it‚Äôs sitting higher than ever before covid"

2021-04-08 18:27:35,wallstreetbets,"you've made so much money off a $2 stock at this point, just sell it. makes no sense to risk it to offset a small tax bill when it may crash again back to $3. Just make your money and be glad it didn't crash and burn in your face"
2021-04-08 17:02:03,wallstreetbets,I think u should have sold at 14 two weeks ago and called it quits..... that moneys has been tied up to long now and u should came out crazy when it hit 20.   So u won‚Äôt see that for year.... it wasn‚Äôt even close to that pre covid
2021-04-08 17:10:22,wallstreetbets,Sell. There‚Äôs only one rocket and that‚Äôs GME
2021-04-08 19:53:38,wallstreetbets,"Hold. The only thing that is keeping AMC from taking off is lack of buyers. It‚Äôs shorted more and more every day, even more so than GME and the price falling scares people that have not seen this type of legal market manipulation so they get scared and paper hand even if it‚Äôs at a loss. They put more pressure on AMC right now because they didn‚Äôt put enough on GME and now it‚Äôs trading at 10-20 times what it should. These are not your every day technical plays. This is a once in a life time opportunity and if people would just buy, hedgies would be forced to cover and $100+ a share is EASY."
2021-04-08 17:22:19,wallstreetbets,"Easy hold, it is worth 17-20 without all the crazy conditions. It‚Äôs best performance would be a Cinemark price(which I consider years & years away)"
2021-04-08 18:19:44,wallstreetbets,Hold
2021-04-08 19:38:34,wallstreetbets,BUY AND HOLD !!!
2021-04-08 19:47:30,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs a short term play. Average out slowly on up days. I think movies are still going to be around. But it will probably be in facilities with a different name on it.
2021-04-08 19:48:18,wallstreetbets,I am buying more. Honestly think the the upside is still to juicy to sell.

i'd cash in the tendies from current (over)value + re-opening of economy this summer.

then, i'd ask myself: are movie theaters a dying business model? can they coexist with the ever-increasing streaming competition? so forth, and so on..."
2021-04-08 17:17:52,wallstreetbets,Ill only sell that low to buy more. No one knows how high itll go.
2021-04-08 18:15:52,wallstreetbets,But they get released in theaters waay before they will be available on netflix.  Furthermore AMC is working with studios for better exclusivity I believe.

2021-04-08 17:18:16,wallstreetbets,"Yep, sell other stock  buy amc"
2021-04-08 18:03:31,wallstreetbets,"This. Don't listen to the meme stock cult voting each other to the top. Even their board sold and gave away a ton of their shares recently, and they know way more about the company, then anyone else. If the smart money is leaving, it's time to go."
2021-04-08 17:13:05,wallstreetbets,"While I dont think you are wrong, probably a more realistic view point that the latter. I do think there could be an argument made that people are tired of not being able to do anything, once things open up we may see people flocking to theatres just because it is something they havent been able to do.

That being said, I agree. If AMC doesn't change their business model, it is a slowly sinking ship."
2021-04-08 18:17:24,wallstreetbets,Did you not see the numbers on Godzilla vs Kong?  People want to get tf out and do stuff and the stats on that movie release are proof.
2021-04-08 17:09:39,wallstreetbets,"I disagree.  Yes you can watch a movie anywhere anytime.  But you can‚Äôt purchase the experience of going to the movies.  When a kick ass movie comes out, where do you want to watch it?  If all hope was lost on theaters why would they keep pushing of the release of maverick?   We are investing in a company that is going to transform the current experience into something that you will pay to go to!  I believe in Ape Movie Company! And we are coming to a city near you!!!"
2021-04-08 19:24:15,wallstreetbets,Wrong. Same game just a different play.
2021-04-08 19:48:35,wallstreetbets,The only thing that is hindering AMC is lack of buying.
2021-04-08 18:52:41,wallstreetbets,">it is worth 17-20 without all the crazy conditions.

You base that on what?"

2021-04-08 18:21:54,wallstreetbets,AMC exclusive blockbusters could be a huge deal
2021-04-08 18:14:18,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, but they gave shares away to family members."
2021-04-08 18:40:13,wallstreetbets,"People will flock just because it will remind them of normalcy and I truly think you will see it be profitable.  However people also get bored easily and with new advances in streaming it won‚Äôt last more than a year without a change to how AMC does business.  Which they may.  I think hold, it will climb for a while and you may miss profits.  When the movie rush starts to die down you will really need some DD on what AMC plans to do to adapt."
2021-04-08 17:18:18,wallstreetbets,"People have been out and about for a long time now. I don‚Äôt know a single person that has huddled in a corner of their house the last year. 

And the last thing people are going to want to do after being limited the last year is to go sit in a dark movie theatre for 3 hours after paying $80 for a couple popcorns and cokes and 2 movie tix."
2021-04-08 18:17:59,wallstreetbets,OK
2021-04-08 17:12:40,wallstreetbets,"This Ape has a point. I agree, I do not go to the movies as often as I did as a kid, because of convenience and what not. But there are still certain movies I make a point to see in theaters, because the theaters is where I get the best viewing experience for those movies."
2021-04-08 17:23:32,wallstreetbets,"Eh I disagree. The quality of tv picture and sound is amazing these days and is better overall than watching an oversized screen with so-so picture quality. 

20 years ago I would agree but technology has come a long way for home movie consumers."
2021-04-08 18:25:52,wallstreetbets,"While I respect your opinion, I would have to regard that thinking as flawed, rose tinted. AMC isn't making the movie Maverick or any *kick ass movie*, they merely host the film to be viewed in their theaters, and just like before Covid, many blockbuster movies hit their theaters and yet less and less people were showing up overall.

The studios making those film push their movies in advertisements and they profit from theater as well as in-app streaming services, contracts with television networks, etc. AMC however has been downtrending the last 5 or so years. Tickets get more expensive, food/beverages are already expensive, and their business model is outdated.

Like the other commenter said, people only miss going to the theater bcuz they miss going out in general. There was a reason this stock was trading so low to begin with.

Pos: AMC $2 Puts Jan 2022/23"
2021-04-08 17:11:25,wallstreetbets,The reality is that you‚Äôre in the minority. In person attendance has been dwindling for years now.
2021-04-08 19:08:06,wallstreetbets,"AMC has room to grow now that they are in the clear. The movie industry is ready to get back to making their pre-pandemic profit margins. Which will come about when we get higher percentages of the population vaccinated. 

Remember, America is still the gold standard of movies & everyone takes from the most popular genres."

I don't know about that.

>The movie industry is ready to get back to making their pre-pandemic profit margins

You should hope not, given that their profit margin was dogshit in 2019"
2021-04-08 19:59:16,wallstreetbets,Right?!? Ive always been big on going to the movies. Sometimes its just a thing people like to do. Some people just like the experience. Now I own the stock too. Ill keep buying it too as long as its offered because i like amc theaters.

There are less people there every time we go. We go once maybe twice a year for a kid movie and a regular movie and we walk up and get right in.
2021-04-08 19:32:32,wallstreetbets,I said industry & even dogshjt was better then 2020.
2021-04-08 17:43:35,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs like us by me. The reasoning is online ticket sales. Our theaters are just as busy but online ticket sales have really sped the process up

Sell at 100k if it makes you happy but hold until after it joins to 1m then back to 100k least then you can get more for what it‚Äôs worth and you don‚Äôt destroy upward pressure selling early
2021-04-08 18:35:56,wallstreetbets,No youre missing my point. Theres a thing called market cap. Just because roblox is 70$ a share doesnt mean its 7x more valuable than ford just because of their share price difference. So your original comment doesnt make any sense. $70 per share. Not every company has the same amount of shares distributed.

In January, just before the day we saw ARK add to the position, but they added heavily post demo. This time its been reverse, ARK has added heavily pre-demo and holds almost 15 million shares. Lady Cathies moves in the coming days will be good to watch, I want to see her add big in the coming days. DO NOTE THE MOST IMPORTANT THING: Cathie did NOT SELL any of her shares even at ATH when her investment had generated 50% return. I am going to be watching ARKs trade pretty closely in the coming days.

Also, the first demo day was just the beginning and we can see the shit it did to PLTR when people saw its product. This second demo day is an addition to that, and we may see even more interest because PLTRs been in quite a few headlines recently with the HULK contracts.

TL;DR: Its a going to be new ATH this month. Lower lows, then higher highs baby."

Look at Google, they only have to give a handful of shares away w/ their stock priced at $2,250 today to be competitive to Facebook, Apple, or Netflix."

2021-04-08 19:05:17,wallstreetbets,I'll take 30 cents on the dollar.  That's basically what it was. I had a limit sell right on 45 so I got super lucky.  I waited a couple weeks and bought back in on a bigass dip.

2021-04-08 17:29:04,wallstreetbets,"No rational or sentiment about the stock at all. 

Saw the price support breaking at 170‚Äôish. Saw the bottom would fall out after that to god knows where. Bought the options at limit 5.9, filled at 5.85 average and was red for about 3 minutes, but was green the whole way after that. I opened the sell order and was not gonna take a big loss and just waited. I lost a little at sale because I set the limit low because I wanted all of the options gone but it was wise because the underlying found the new price support and went up from there. Average on sell was actually a little less than listed here so I lost a little from the gain shown. 

Not the smartest thing I‚Äôve done, close to dumbest, but it was a gainer all for holding a put for a couple of minutes."

holdmetendy didn't say that they were trading options. 

you missed the question tho, so you might know your options but lack reading comprehension. the post doesn't show the price of the underlying when the contract was purchased nor the date it was opened on, which is what they were asking."
2021-04-08 17:15:44,wallstreetbets,"I think he‚Äôs asking at what price GME was trading when he opend the put tho. Not what premium he paid for it.

Strike Price + Premium = call

Strike Price - Premium = put"
2021-04-08 17:23:04,wallstreetbets,">Average cost + Break even = price of underlying at purchase.

> So yes the post does‚Ä¶

nope. looks like you're the one who shouldn't be trading options. that will give you the strike price. a dead giveaway should be that it's a round number, i.e., $5.85 + $159.15 = $165.00.

You at least wouldn't be an ass if you could admit that you were half wrong.

But no worries: I'm here to do it for you.

It doesn't show when he took them out, so smart guy: when did he open these positions, as asked?"
2021-04-08 17:22:00,wallstreetbets,Yeah and as far as I can tell you can‚Äôt calculate that with the information given since the premium is not a fixed amount for each dollar amount the stock is trading over the strike price since there‚Äôs also IV and time until expiration that gets factored in. (But maybe I‚Äôm too smooth brained)
2021-04-08 17:18:07,wallstreetbets,Bro I get that that‚Äôs how you calculate break even. But at what price was GME trading when he bought the put?

it's to the point where I've been trying to sleep absurdly early in the day (sometimes as early as 4 PM PST) because nothing but the stock market excites me or convinces me to get up and do that whole Staying Alive thing everybody seems to expect me to do. i've become increasingly more comfortable with writing off more and more losses as ""I'll win it back later"" and dissatisfied with any gain under four digits.

2021-04-08 17:51:59,wallstreetbets,"my play for my ASO calls:

sell at open tomorrow either in the green or at a break-even, as close as you can get. IV will be probably be absurdly high, and selling at open is your best chance.

ASO tends to trade sideways during the day and it swings in the AH.

if you're looking for more, SELL your 4/16s and roll them into shares or 5/21 calls or further if you like the stock. DO NOT POSITION YOURSELF FOR A ""SQUEEZE"" ITS PROBABLY NOT HAPPENING THIS WEEK OR NEXT WEEK. 

ASO actively resists any notably strong upward or downward movement (anything more than 5-7% per intraday session), whoever's trying to play it spends a lot volume keeping it pinned within a range and preventing any breakouts from happening except AH when the volume is really low.

godspeed you beautiful retards, let's start at $30 minimum tomorrow

EDIT: also, i dont know how many of you dont know this, but DO NOT BUY AT MARKET OPEN DURING AN UPTICK. you wait for a dip during the day if you want to get in. and dips are very likely to happen. think about your entry point."

By near market close tomorrow, most of the short shares should have been covered and day-traders will hold for earnings because they‚Äôre not stupid.

Earnings moved up a day early for pre market isn‚Äôt for the S/p to be beaten down for full 5 trading days, we‚Äôre beating these low ball estimates of 163M (only 3M more than last Q)

The merger. We will merge with Tilray immediately following earnings with the merger vote on the 14th and merger expecting to be settled by 4/20.

Possible but not plausible news coming from Irwin Simon is always a possibility.

I am long on APHA with 1,235 shares and a shit lot of options that are decaying but by Monday the story will be different.

Cannabis is taking the world by storm and I wish this sub had a more open mindset other than tech and EVs.

Within the next 5-10 years, name another industry that will grow as fast or similar to EVs? 

Cannabis.

From a technical aspect, these stock have been in consolidation for a while now, APHA seems to have formed a bull pennant and the volume has REALLY thinned out (I ignored the fall over the last few days, as I feel that was due to these hedge funds heavily shorting these stocks so that they could then buy at the levels we saw yesterday and today).

3- Seeking Alpha follows and does their own shit piece.

Last earnings we touched 12 before rocketing up all the way past $30 and this earnings won‚Äôt be anything different with SweetWater Brewing added to the books and mega merger with Tilray. 

Something about the timing, almost exactly like last time, had me doubling down the same way I did last earnings.

Sorry POE, I like you, but you wouldnt exist without D2.

What POE did was cater to the no lifer ""twitch"" crowd who play 15 hours a day. For normal people, the leagues reset too often so you get stuck playing the same parts every league. Yeah standard is a thing, its an unbalanced mess with no people where items cost a million times more if you can even find a trade.

Simply put each league is 99% the same with one added feature and a few new skills or items. End game involves running the same maps 800000. You zopm zoom spamming one ability and everything explodes.

Is it great your first time doing everything, sure. But shit like going through acts 1 through 10 and unlocking labryth and running through that like on four difficulties is fucking tedious.

Also super end game  is basocally get hit once and die for most builds. Thats fine if the game didbt suffer massive fps drops, rubberbanding, desync, lag, etc. Uts gad isdues since open beta lol. Lost my HC char to a desync and quit for like 7 years."

2021-04-08 18:54:55,wallstreetbets,"I would switch up ur vices with less detrimental vices, like THC and ween urself off painkillers and maybe even alcohol.  If ur gonna gamble all ur money try to split it between options and stocks, and never sell the stocks, especially the ones that pay dividends.  That way even if u lose half ur money on options and ur stock values go down, someday down the road those stocks might profit or will be good insurance money.   

Also the feeling of need for purpose is a social construct.  There are ways of thinking like Taoism that deemphasize the need for purpose and find fulfillment in other ways, like accepting yourself and your imperfections.  

Existentialism is cool too but nihilism is always a danger.

Also buy urself a blender and make yogurt fruit smoothies.  super easy, cheap, fulfilling, and healthy.  you feel good making it, feel good eating it, and you'll have a  lot of energy to trade and masturbate or whatever"

JPM may have sold off a lot of some private fund's shares, that is just speculation right now. The AH price action kicked off with a large buy and then it was featured on CNBC. There was major support at $26.5 today, so I don't think anyone is going to lose a ton if they bought shares and it dipped again."

2021-04-08 18:35:57,wallstreetbets,BA is up about 15% over the last month.
2021-04-08 19:08:23,wallstreetbets,"Look at fintel.io and all the dumping that has been happening. Rising it up pre market then followed immediately by dump at open and between 10:45 and 11:00 AM EST has been the norm. I don‚Äôt see them holding onto the short shares past Friday and into Monday‚Äôs most likely positive earnings. Day traders won‚Äôt be dumb either to sell on Friday to buy back on Monday. The earnings beat by APHA on Monday can very well revert this downtrend in the sector all together and we can live in tendies for the week into the merger. There‚Äôs a lot of great things going for APHA.

Who‚Äôs not to say there is also some rumor I‚Äôve hear to be announced and materialized after earnings and the merger vote go through? Large cash infusion like CGC? Who‚Äôs to say? But Irwin is aggressive and experienced and wouldn‚Äôt be too surprised him and the leadership team have something up their sleeves either.

My calls may die, but I‚Äôm not selling my shares."
2021-04-08 19:15:19,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôve seen a couple other people who got the same email today. It basically said if you don‚Äôt appropriately update your investment profile or contact support we will be taking away your options privileges in 7 days.

2021-04-08 16:36:22,wallstreetbets,Idk spys pretty much a meme stock now
2021-04-08 17:06:55,wallstreetbets,"The Reuters article on that says :

""Hestia has a mandate to invest in ‚Äúdeep value‚Äù assets that are unloved and undervalued. GameStop‚Äôs shares have been on a wild rally since January as amateur traders organized on social media platforms such as Reddit to snap them up, making them unsuitable for the kind of investing Hestia‚Äôs clients hired the fund for, the sources said.

Hestia returned 223.7% in the first three months of 2021 after gaining 162% last year, and Wolf now plans to unload the GameStop shares, the sources said.""

I'm not sure how that's bad news given Hestia's penchant for long-term investments. GME is certainly volatile, but that reads to me more like Hestia desiring stable increases and balanced portfolios over timing a squeeze - they already have 3500% increase per the article since they invested back at $5

Edit: could it not also indicate they simply want the freedom to sell at a price point of their choosing? Either way, not seeing the bearish sentiment"

But fine, alright why would demand increase so much to shift price to 2x, 3x, 10x, 100x? like what people are quoting. Seriously what's the justification for the thinking?

I feel like no one can give me a realistic reason for it explode in value from this point. I know i'm gathering the downvotes but you need to be realistic

If the share price hit $1000 dollars, that's a $70bn market car, up from ~$11bn. What is going on with GME to justify something like a $59bn increase in value? No one can give a solid answer other than ShOrt SQueEze"

>fuboTV Inc. (NYSE: FUBO), the leading sports-first live TV streaming platform, announced today it has acquired the exclusive live streaming rights to the Qatar World Cup 2022 Qualifying matches of South American Football Confederation.

Edit: This ~~is gonna~~ might gamma squeeze tomorrow. $21c's are in the money, and $22's are almost there and open interest is 4900 contracts. $22.50s have 3000 open interest. 4,000 at each of $23 and $24, and 6,000 at $25. I don't have any contracts on this but lots of people gonna bring home tendies tomorrow.

Edit 2: Passed $22 AH. Above figures are just 4/9 expiry. Looking at 4/16, open interest on the $25's is 15k. This shit might actually hit $30 tomorrow. Autist u/Darth-Agalloch may have called it:
>FUBO is 1 PR away from triggering a beautiful run up, then the FOMO sets in, and boom, they are back at $30 before you know it.

Edit : guys a lot of you are asking how to confirm with your broker. Ask them for a proxy card or to vote by proxy, That should give you access to the online voting ( to the best of my knowledge ü¶ç)üòÅ

Edit2: tons of questions on the proxy. Basically it is a number given to you, by your broker to allow you voting once the link is up. I believe you won‚Äôt be able to obtain it until the 15th with some brokers, while with others you can already ask for

The link to vote in the GameStop Meeting last year was  https://www.proxyvotenow.com/pvn/defco5inn/controlI.jsp?app=gme&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;mobile=y

2021-04-08 19:10:18,wallstreetbets,"This is why I went all in on GME and AMC. There‚Äôs something about this. A turning point or a kind of reckoning. I‚Äôm 37 and I was at occupy Wallstreet. It fizzled because we couldn‚Äôt do anything.

In January 2021 a few hedge funds got caught with their pants down. The financial establishment and media were like ¬´¬†okay okay you got us, but if you try this again it won‚Äôt work. We got your number so get back in line¬†¬ª

Now it‚Äôs happening again and I think there‚Äôs just something that the financial establishment isn‚Äôt getting. A new investor class is emerging and they aren‚Äôt going to play by wallstreets rigged system. I love it and I want to be a part of it.

As being an investor / amateur trader with a bachelors in finance and 2 levels of my CFA completed I can say this about Wallstreet and how they think:

1. They decide what company is valuable. Not you. This is enshrined in esoteric terminology designed to scare the common person away. The truth? It ain‚Äôt complicated and the gen z and millennials have figured it out.

2. If the economy is raging. They make money first and must make a hell of a lot more than you do. If you get a crumb that falls off the table that‚Äôs all you get.

3. If the economy is in the dumpster and companies are going bankrupt, all the better, they are still entitled to make money through derivatives and other bullshit trading instruments which makes no fucking sense.

4. If the country goes to war, they‚Äôre entitled to make money.

5. If there‚Äôs a massive terrorist attack like 9/11 they‚Äôll still make money.

6. Heck they‚Äôll still make money if there‚Äôs a financial collapse of THEIR MAKING.

7. Even if they have to lie, grease palms, steal, cheat. They will make money.

I say fuck ‚Äòem. And DO NOT believe anyone who has been a product of the system. That goes for people born into the plutocracy that runs it and even more the people who were outsiders that had to fight their way in (think S. Cohen, J Befort, Cramer etc.). They‚Äôre the absolute worst because they had to double down on the deceptive bullshit to ¬´¬†make it¬†¬ª there in the first place and are the number 1 types to defend the current status quo implicitly or explicitly."

But i don‚Äôt think wallstreet or the financial media can do anything to stop it. Interestingly though, their fixation on derailing this movement may actually be helping. Why share gamestop share price every minute on the tv screen. why the urge to call the game over and assign defeat to these new investors, all painted by the way with the same brush as traitors. even though if they knew any better, these folks relish being the notion of being the ultimate long term position holders, AKA ‚ÄúDiamond Hands‚Äù. 

You know just a week ago WSJ wrote about how the reddit crowd had taken so many hits in February that they packed up and faded away. Presumably they went back to playing video games. Now i read less activity as being smart during that wild durations and increased uncertainty. I thought it was a moment of maturation. The updated data shows that retail investors outbid older ones, have quickly returned to the market. I can tell you from my own day to day ¬†experience with new investors, there‚Äôs so many folks in their 40s, 50s and their 60s who are just now getting in this market for the first time. But I do believe the focus should be on millennial investors and Gen Z cohort. I believe that these are the folks that will save this country, because they have a high degree of self-confidence and they do want to achieve. They want to pull themselves by the bootstraps, in fact on that note, there is a really great research page from Andreessen Horowitz on the resurgence of active trading. It talks about the platforms and communities of course, but it also goes deeper on why the revolution is happening. 

As it turns out they said it boils down to American Exceptionalism. Yep that same vibe that \_?\_ got when they came to America to study the prison system in 1831. The individual americans, i mean they had the certain swagger and notion that they can achieve beyond their stationed(?) life in which they were born, that feeling was fading in this country people. Now i want you to look at this graph and see how confident we are, when we expect benefits from the financial and market, and investments than anyone else. So, i think American Exceptionalism is back, and with that I give it to Ashley Webster"""

I just emailed robinhood and they said that when shareholder votes come around you will be sent a link through a third party app to vote by proxy. I am on a cash account with robinhood so as I understand if I have the ability to vote then I have the shares assigned to me."
2021-04-08 16:52:11,wallstreetbets,"Is a million dollars worth a 5 min confirmation phone call?

Made me smile when I reached out today!!!"
2021-04-08 17:38:49,wallstreetbets,"TDA confirmed to me this afternoon that long holders of shares will always have the right to vote, and that if you're on a cash account your shares are not lent out."
2021-04-08 16:27:51,wallstreetbets,"From what I understand,  no. Check your broker yourself tho to be sure if you're worried."
2021-04-08 18:04:24,wallstreetbets,"Call them. They are incredibly helpful and didn‚Äôt care that I was clearly not as informed as their usual clients. It literally took 10 min. You might have to hold for a bit, but I got through in not too long. Seriously, don‚Äôt fret."
2021-04-08 17:05:24,wallstreetbets,"Pretty sure your account is margin until the cash settles and then from there you‚Äôre a full fledged cash account. Just make sure you‚Äôre buying with settled cash and you should be in the clear. 

*I also and retarded so that may be misinformation. Please correct me where necessary*

Edit: see comments for better dd"
2021-04-08 19:04:53,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm on RH. You can set your account to cash only and turn off instant settlement. Once that is done your shares won‚Äôt be lent out
2021-04-08 17:57:00,wallstreetbets,"I just switched to a cash account with RH but this is what they said to me:

‚ÄúFor your own future use, shares in a margin account may only be loaned out if you are borrowing on margin.‚Äù

Since I was not using margin, this implies my shares were not loaned out. Who knows if that‚Äôs really the case, however."
2021-04-08 17:02:40,wallstreetbets,Do I change this in the app
2021-04-08 18:29:49,wallstreetbets,"Confirmed that by default my account type is ""margin""."
2021-04-08 17:44:45,wallstreetbets,Once cash tho you lose options and the ability to have access to funds instantly which defeats the whole purpose people use rh lol
2021-04-08 17:25:25,wallstreetbets,"Lol, call"
2021-04-08 18:44:18,wallstreetbets,"Too late for those who have it right now.

2021-04-08 17:23:51,wallstreetbets,Just tried this and they said I have to wait a few days due to some recent activity. Bastards don't make it easy.
2021-04-08 19:11:19,wallstreetbets,"I can't find a ""contact page"" on the app, and I feel like I've exhausted every attempt at finding anyway to contact Robinhood other than emailing help@robinhood.
Any recommendations would be great."
2021-04-08 16:57:04,wallstreetbets,As a schwabs investor it means you don‚Äôt have to do anything. No need to call and ‚Äúrecall your shares‚Äù no need to call and exercise your share rights. Just wait and mooooooonnnnnn.

2021-04-08 19:12:06,wallstreetbets,"His skit has enough truth to be amusing, but ""openly"" is relevant in that one is culturally assumed to be heterosexual, thus someone who isn't expressing their homosexuality isn't ""openly"" displaying it - it's a better critique of our prudishness and bigotry than it is of the choice of language being used. In much the same way, while Carlin is accurate about ""happens to be"" in most contexts, it becomes pointful to use such a phrase when it becomes *relevant* what would be normally not an issue but is in this specific circumstance - and, in this case, was arguably used for comedic effect *because* it's absurd to make a claim of racism when we use the phrase ""ape"" so generally.

Of course, that's no fun to point out at parties, but it still is the case."

2021-04-08 18:33:29,wallstreetbets,All of your orders are done on margin. It takes days for orders to settle so margin is used to credit or debit you. It has nothing to do with borrowing margin for your own use.

2021-04-08 18:00:32,wallstreetbets,So my account is one of the default margin ones but I don‚Äôt use margin and never plan on borrowing money. Why does it matter if I switch to a cash account if I‚Äôm already treating it like one? I feel like there‚Äôs something I‚Äôm not understanding
2021-04-08 16:57:53,wallstreetbets,Interesting. How does something like this affect those who intend to exercise their voting rights with a company that they hold shares of?
2021-04-08 17:42:35,wallstreetbets,"No, any app that lets you buy and sell instantly is margin technically otherwise you would have to wait for funds, I believe on cash app you have no choice since its geared toward people who are brand new hence no options etc."

2021-04-08 18:09:05,wallstreetbets,"I wasn‚Äôt trying to white knight, just communicating what I was just told.

2021-04-08 17:55:31,wallstreetbets,"Yea thats what i was getting at really no point to use rh if your changing to cash account, the lure of it is instant everything. Fidelity or any other broker would be a way better option if going cash act"
2021-04-08 19:51:33,wallstreetbets,"Wasn‚Äôt the issue when GME was getting to 500 that rh Didn‚Äôt have the cash to BUY the shares? That‚Äôs why you could still sell them just not buy them 

Not to mention for cash backed accounts I‚Äôd hope it‚Äôs different. Anyways, I‚Äôm prob fucked either way so just gotta ride with it. Guess I could technically deposit more money in fidelity and sell the shares on RH and buy em on fidelity. Hopefully get some smart apes to clarify this weekend"
2021-04-08 18:01:31,wallstreetbets,"Tried that, and when I click Gold it's giving me an overview of the benefits. If I keep going it asks if I want to turn Margin On.

So it appears to be off but my account statements say I'm on Margin (due to it getting set up as Instant Access). All the documentation I said says you have to wait 3 days after you close all market orders. I had a few sell limits set, so I cancelled them and now I guess I gotta wait."

2021-04-08 17:04:16,wallstreetbets,"It doesn't affect voting rights at all if you buy the stock through a broker, what you are buying is the right to own the stock and therefore all the rights that associate with it (including voting). It is possible to sever the voting rights from the other rights associated with owning a stocks (like what happened with McKenzie Bezos), but that is relatively rare."
2021-04-08 19:51:20,wallstreetbets,Thats why its called 'proxy voting'. The brokerage votes for you by proxy since they're the ones that technically own the shares even though they appear in your account and you were the one that bought them.
2021-04-08 19:48:03,wallstreetbets,"I can give you my APHA example. My broker sent me a package in the mail with a voting card & code on it stating that APHA had an upcoming voting meeting. (I‚Äôve been expecting it). 

I now have to go and open a link, provide my code and then place my vote. 

Then on the voting day, my broker will place my vote in the shareholders meeting on my behalf. I‚Äôm sure they gather up all of their votes across all accounts and place the vote as a whole, but I‚Äôm not 100% sure on that. 

If I don‚Äôt respond to the mail or the website they provide me, then my shares will not be voted with and I lose my vote."

2021-04-08 18:00:39,wallstreetbets,"Incorrect. While that's true, your still a margin account with them because they give you instant settlement. 

A cash account you have to play by clearing and settlement rules. Basically you have to wait 2 days before you can yolo after you yolo.

If you're a diamond hand ape, cash account won't phase you. But if you're day trading spy that instant settlement is a cheat code."

2021-04-08 17:35:42,wallstreetbets,"This is just a message board, pal........everyone is anonymous, remember? You could be talking to a 5-year old.....you could be talking to a multi-millionaire.....you could be talking to someone who knows his shit.....you could be talking to someone who is deceitful. At the end of the day, don't get your panties wet hearing people who don't agree with you. A lot of you here love to downvote and put down voices like mine.....does that make your stock price go up? No fucking way! Never does, never will. So why the fuck do people like you fail to have a conversation at every turn? I'll tell you why........YOU ARE UNEDUCATED! Pure and simple. The belligerent monkey comes out from within people like you, and then you attack first, ask questions later. It's okay, man....unevolved people cannot be taught new things. So just go back to your chanting AMC to the Moon or GME to the MOON.....maybe the ""stock gods"" will hear you and make it happen, lmao"
2021-04-08 18:03:51,wallstreetbets,"I didn't have a gold account, but my stocks were still margin. I didn't go to the 'Gold' option that everyone keeps saying, because it only talks about upgrading to a gold account with a free trial, and I didn't want to go through all that in case it delayed anything.

I sent them an e-mail through the website's message function and got my account changed to Cash from Instant-Access (Margin) in 6 minutes from the time I hit send. I had to take the long way around because I couldn't find a direct link. All the links I found went to an automated FAQ-style page.

(On the website) Go to **Account** in the top-right,  
then **Contact Us**,  
then **""I have a different Question""**,  
then **""Account""**,  
**""Additional Features""**,  
and then **""Robinhood Gold""**.

From here, look at the bottom of the page, and click the 'Contact Us' link below the bigger 'Sign up for Robinhood Gold' button, and it should take you to the ""Send an e-mail"" page. I just simply said 2 sentences:

>I would like to downgrade my account from Instant Access to a Cash account. I understand there are restrictions with this change, and want to continue with it.

Then 6 minutes later, I got an e-mail confirming they've changed it, and when I log back in, I have a message about how there is a restriction on accessing funds and whatnot. Just means you can't trade on unsettled funds anymore - if you want to trade, you have to deposit funds and wait for them to fully clear (3-5 business days). You can e-mail them later if you want to go back to an instant-access account."
2021-04-08 18:01:14,wallstreetbets,Yes see my reply above. Rh is default margin account since they give you instant settlement
2021-04-08 18:02:22,wallstreetbets,My profile says margin trading -> off and when I click on the option it shows me rates etc of margin.
2021-04-08 17:52:03,wallstreetbets,"Not what RH support told me this morning. They said I had to close out my options and turn it off to convert to a cash account. 

They also said my shares weren't being lent out even though my account is margin."
2021-04-08 17:43:44,wallstreetbets,"You‚Äôre a goof.

This whole comment thread is you coming in with negative commentary without providing backup to your claim.

Everyone that‚Äôs positive on this post has their reasons to be.

You didn‚Äôt provide a insightful opinion, you didn‚Äôt open the floor to a meaningful conversation.

It's going to continue to have to spend massive amounts of money creating content, starting to pay taxes in foreign jurisdictions and it is having to pay more for its licenses content which makes up 95% of its catalogue. I honestly think with all the streaming services Dis+ is going to win in the end.  It doesn't matter what other streaming services you have, if you have kids or grandkids you likely have Dis+ and they are taking the Disney channel off of a lot of cable provider packages."

2021-04-08 16:23:34,wallstreetbets,Do you not understand numbers?  VIAC was sitting at around $25 until it was artificially inflated to $100 by a hedge fund who recently blew itself up because spoiler alert - VIAC isn't worth $100.
2021-04-08 16:27:24,wallstreetbets,"You're the worst. It blew up as a combination of a highly leveraged position PLUS an improvement of fundamentals (11 yr extension of NFL contract, release of paramount+, etc). Noone on WSB thinks its bouncing back to 100 tomorrow but 50-70 range is realistic"

2021-04-08 14:56:53,wallstreetbets,The Fed keeps saying this because they have every intention of running inflation hot for a good long time to devalue all the debt.
2021-04-08 15:00:46,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs more like 10%. Everything we actually spend our money on goes up 10% per year.

2021-04-08 15:17:51,wallstreetbets,"So obvious, the current way we calculate inflation is flawed, and is only being held up by the deflationary pressure from tech, areas that are not impacted by advances in manufacturing or technology you can easily see how inflation is impacting them. 

Hell, our current way of calculating inflation doesn‚Äôt even track prices like it should, rather replaces them with lower cost goods within the same basket if the price of the current item gets too high, and they lie through their teeth saying that ‚Äúquality has obviously increased‚Äù. 

Their medical and education expenses are incredibly underweight (education is ~2-3% (college education is 1.5%) weighted in the CPI-U index, medical care + equipment is 8% weighted) which also includes the total uncovered cost, which seems pretty ridiculous to me."

2021-04-08 14:54:27,wallstreetbets,Of course the fed won‚Äôt panic. They know it‚Äôs going way past 2%. It‚Äôll get to a point of hyper inflation vs destructive recession before the fed fights inflation. Even then it‚Äôd probably choose inflation lmao

2021-04-08 18:01:25,wallstreetbets,"These comments are funny. The only reason inflation has been so low for so long previous to the pandemic was because almost none of the money created actually got to the general population. If people do not receive extra money to purchase things then the cost of goods can not escalate due to less or zero demand due to no money to purchase them. If people have extra money to purchase goods then producers can ask for more money due to scarcity. Economics is a big circle. When too much money gets siphoned off in one location for too long it fucks everything up. Right now the money is being siphoned to people (stimulus). For the previous 5 decades it‚Äôs been siphoned mainly to corporations and the wealthy. (Tax loopholes and straight up cheating) Next up, siphoning some more into the government. (Infrastructure) The only way out for a capitalist society is to grow your way out. More people, more buying, more creating, more consuming. Its not worth getting worked up over or scared cause in the long run we‚Äôre all dead anyway. Just be thankful you didn‚Äôt die alone on a gurney with a plastic tube shoved down your throat.

No I want to deny that because the housing market is solid as ever, and recovered from a 30% market crash in less then a year. Mortgage rates are at all time lows.

>It‚Äôs when you have a massive spike in homeless

Not sure how accurate homelessness statistics are but everywhere I look shows a very small but steady decline in homelessness up to 2020.

Even when BB was a phone company they weren't just a phone company. It's like saying Google is just a search engine, or Amazon is just an online retailer. None of these things have been true for decades, if ever, and anyone that isn't a moron has always known this, but suddenly he found out recently and thinks that no one else actually knew. It's the same everywhere on this sub.

Look at all the people here talking about Chewy as a comparable to GME who clearly have *no idea* what Chewy actually even is, how it started or *why* it was successful, how it makes its money, and why it doesn't translate to GME."
2021-04-08 15:59:53,wallstreetbets,"Basically their business is making secure/security software. BB  has not really been in the phone market for a long time. TCL made their last couple series of phones, loaded it with Android and branded it BB."

2021-04-08 15:45:24,wallstreetbets,You can't directly trade the vix got to be an etf or an etn never knew there was a vix etn called vix either which got me really confused that's cool though is it just vxx and they call it vix?
2021-04-08 18:18:35,wallstreetbets,It's buy to open vs sell to open.

2021-04-08 16:16:14,wallstreetbets,"What the hell does bad news from 1999 have to do with Plug's current potential? Bad news from like 20 years ago. If hydrogen power becomes even semi-relevant in the emerging renewables market, Plug has the best position to capitalize on it. Buying the dip here seems like the best idea floating on this sub compared with the rest of the ideas popping out."
2021-04-08 14:02:46,wallstreetbets,"It wasn‚Äôt the last two years alone but all of 2018, 2019, and 3 quarters of 2020 for improper financial reporting. Surprisingly, they found no fraud!

I sold out of all my PLUG holdings that day and never looking back."
2021-04-08 19:13:11,wallstreetbets,"Yes, an emerging tech struggled to pioneer a new fuel source.. it has since become commercially viable which is why they power forklifts in some of the largest distribution centers in the world (amazon and walmart), and power buses in germany and china. Also they are profitable which is why they jumped to 70$ a share. They tanked due to reports of incorrect filings which will be amended and will most likely be inconsequential.

Your thesis is 20 years ago someone invested too early. 

Source - owned hundreds of shares at 2 dollars and still own ~150 at $25/share."
2021-04-08 14:16:38,wallstreetbets,"Old dude here.  Listen, this is not new technology and has been around over 20 years with PLUG trying to make a profit that whole time.   I literally sold PLUG in 1999 for $128 when it was first a momentum play, and it promptly went down to like a dollar or so and stayed there 20 years.  Slightly up and down again.  I think they sold some freakin forklifts to FedEx or something.  Never made a profit.   Its only gonna make money on a momentum thing when you sell it to somebody else and get out.  Not a long term hold!   Trust me."
2021-04-08 16:32:26,wallstreetbets,"Well, your text is nice and shows a lot of negative things about the stock (I dont like them at all!) ... but Ballard is almost doing the same thing and is a good company, still overvalued though.

I agree with you and they already did it and burned everyones money before! 

PS:
""Simply transport over transmission lines..."", working at an institute of electric power systems makes me say no (but HVDC is an option). There is a use for those systems, but its only plausable in 2040-2050 (estimated by several studies). The problem is in detail very complicated and is in part linked to offshore RE and volatility in the grid as well as several assumptions.

So, there is a way... but the technology today needs to be used where it makes sense (those places exist!), the potential use is connected to a >80%RE world... so speculation. 


So... to speak in the language of wallstreet bets: put all your money in and buy calls"
2021-04-08 14:43:28,wallstreetbets,"Hey guy I have a 29 4/30 P. 
  
Have you looked into the SPDJI rebalancing? The SPDJI is followed by ICLN and INRG (not sure if that's the correct ETF) but on like 4/19 the SPDJI has to rebalance. 
  
This causes the ICLN and INRG to need to rebalance. ICLN alone is at 8% plug when, after the rebalance, apparently the max cap for companies is 4.5%. 
  
So yeah, there's a lot of reason to buy Plug puts."

Plug is not profitable nor do it‚Äôs fundamentals add up, but with the Biden flaunting everything in climate change, ev, and fomo this will not pay out. Can it be profitable, of course. Overpriced, yes, it has been and will continue to be. But I believe plug will rise as any ‚Äúgreen‚Äù news comes out and that will be a lot with this schmo at the helm of the country. Not here for politics so push that aside, I do not agree with this play. Good luck."
2021-04-08 14:12:23,wallstreetbets,Are my 6/18 $10p too aggressive? I‚Äôm also looking at the ICLN rebalance coming up with them being nearly 10% of current holding.
2021-04-08 16:29:53,wallstreetbets,"Nothing in the market makes sense right now.  As long as a green agenda is pushed and promoted, this company will ride the momentum.  I saw an article today about PLUG submitting at a chance to get some funds from the Dept of Energy - if they were to somehow get it, this will go up quickly and significantly.

&#x200B;

I recently bought a lot of very cheap long calls and I'm expecting this to get back up to $50 by Q3.  I go back and forth on the 'accounting errors' based on various articles, but its hard to make anything of it since every publishing avenue is biased one way or the other.  If I'm lucky, they get bought out by a bigger company and I retire early."

As I recalled our horrid interaction, my whole body shook in disgust and I broke into a permanent frenzy of anger and confusion. What you told me was undisputedly the dumbest combination of words uttered in the entire world. Get up, walk into the middle of the nearest forest and lay down and reflect on what you did. Never utter a syllable out of that hole in your face again, and allow yourself to decompose. I'm disgusted at the fact that you exist on the same planet as me, and what is worse is that you share similar dna to me. The fact that our DNA is connected, even marginally, is an abomination. You almost singlehandedly destroyed mankind by being conscious. The realization that we both fall under the term ""human"" and I have to be grouped in with your pathetic existence is disgraceful. I am very traumatized by you. Your body language is atrocious and it bothers me to no end. It's so pathetic, the way you mope around. You mope around with your shoulders hunched over, lethargically dragging your feet on the floor. You have a thin, fragile frame. You walk around reacting to everything that happens to you. There are horrible, inexcusable things that I would happily do to never interact with you again, even if it was for a brief moment."

2021-04-08 15:44:43,wallstreetbets,"I haven‚Äôt looked into this deeply. In general frontrunning index changes can be a source of edge, but the important quantity to focus on is the percentage of an issuer‚Äôs float that‚Äôll change hands rather than the index weighting. (So S&P 500 ETFs buying TSLA is a bigger deal than theme ETFs selling PLUG. But what you really love to see is a big dividend ETF dumping an entire position when the issuer cuts the payment.)

I saw it when a PE firm bought Whataburger, they boycotted, hard. Then the LGBQ community tried to cancel chickfila (started in GA, I know) because the owner was a christian, ppl sat in the drive-thru line for hours with their cars painted in bible verses (I shit you not). Texans are loyal and proud of their brands. Just ask Dick's, their getting their dicks kicked in in  ASO's markets. Point is, if this catches any traction like GME did and the word gets out, you better believe ASO will have some record breaking sales and you will have full support of all Texans and they will have a blast doing it."

2021-04-08 13:09:39,wallstreetbets,"While I hope you're right because I have several contracts expiring 4/16, i'm hesitant. Couldn't it be possible that MMs caused yesterdays drop in price AH in order to close out their positions? Considering no one is holding HFs accountable for reporting their positions accurately, and it' appears that it's being held below $30 to keep the majority of options OTM despite having adequate volume, I wouldn't be surprised if we all get burned. With that being said, if volume picks up even more, they might not be able to continue holding it down."
2021-04-08 15:01:37,wallstreetbets,"Don't even look at this from a short squeeze or JPM/KKR sell-off if true - look more medium/long term. Fundamentally, ASO is a great stock to have right now in your portfolio. I've been holding since the beginning (its my favorite store so I'm biased)...but reading their financials (increased cash flow, halved their LT debt, increased net income, beat earnings estimates)...and they're not even in the most profitable quarter (spring/summer - football, baseball, camping, running shoes, etc.).

Just buy and hold for longer than a day and it'll pay off.

2021-04-08 15:16:15,wallstreetbets,"Was really hoping to close out of my 4/16 calls tomorrow, but there has been a lot of price manipulation this week.  There were large ITM put buys Tuesday and today at $35 and then this article that has been circulating but has no potential to be real unless KKR sold. Looks like I'll be holding onto all of my calls into next week. Bought more today for 4/16 and 5/21.

&nbsp;

Hopefully the pro-ASO whales are just waiting to make their moves until closer to the expiry 4/16. They are out there. There are a few large support walls that aren't explained by retail, like the 80,057 share buy order at $26.46.

For all the haters who are tired of the ASO is like RKT posts... ok. Things are not lining up like RKT exactly, but the same variables are in play on this stock, except for volume. If we break $35, expect that to change."

That‚Äôs what will piss off Texans and that was the thesis. Lighten up little buddy."
2021-04-08 15:56:27,wallstreetbets,All I can do now is hope
2021-04-08 13:27:49,wallstreetbets,"Sorry, maybe I didn't catch that. I guess i'm just doubtful that they exited because if they had, wouldn't it have started running by now with the increase buy pressure as a result of the morning dip?"
2021-04-08 19:24:05,wallstreetbets,"Its extremely undervalued. Relatively new IPO. It dominates the southeast, so many people have never heard of it. It's been heavily shorted (40%+) - only reason I know of was shares lockup was ending. Possible margin call sell off by KKR/JPM (rumor). And the share lockup ended so I'm sure employees are still selling at times.

So right now there are some downward pressures on this stock that is keeping it lower. But this will be a 40-50+ stock if no share offerings by ASO occur. It has a lot of room for increased market cap (around $2B+ and Dicks is at $5B+ for comparable) and a P/E ratio under 10! (From last I looked)."
2021-04-08 17:17:12,wallstreetbets,"Just for a counterpoint (this is in no way meant to attack anyone else's ideas, I'm relatively new to this as well), let me offer a few thoughts here. I started looking at this stock on 1 April, the day before the hype train really started to roll here. Volume was good and ASO was breaking into a higher channel that was also an all-time high for the stock. This made me nervous. There isn't any technology catalyst to justify a further push up (no one's invented a new soccer ball, to the best of my knowledge), just solid fundamentals on the company. It seemed overbought and overhyped. The short situation is potentially interesting, but if we have learned anything from this year it is that squeezes and unpredictable and lots of players have lots of tools at their disposal to mess with them.

Anyway, this seemed to me like a good opportunity to go against the crowd so I bought 5 $30 puts and just sold them today for about a $500 gain. Nothing to get too excited about, but I thought worth mentioning."
2021-04-08 15:35:15,wallstreetbets,"It seems that the conditions are there for you to profit, but you could just as easily loose it all if you hold those calls to next Friday. It is a high risk play with potentially high reward."
2021-04-08 16:25:56,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs highly undervalued. If you‚Äôre scared of options shares are on sale.

2021-04-08 13:32:59,wallstreetbets,"I don't doubt it. If anything, the crazy high institutional ownership (91% I think?) would lead me to believe that all they're doing is algo trading to manipulate price. If that's the case, i'm not sure how we win this without the help of a whale."

2021-04-08 14:40:26,wallstreetbets,To be fair the amount of roi for his shares this year makes sense. Also probably will soften any blow when he sells
2021-04-08 15:22:16,wallstreetbets,Mr.Chairman good luck!

2021-04-08 17:12:10,wallstreetbets,This is a big dick move.
2021-04-08 18:20:54,wallstreetbets,"How about they use part of the capital raised from the ATM offering to pay a dividend? Maybe not the best long term value for it, but if they think this can squeeze, a dividend could be the catalyst for liftoff. üöÄüöÄüöÄ"
2021-04-08 18:26:48,wallstreetbets,I mean I'll take his compensation if he doesn't want it...
2021-04-08 19:08:02,wallstreetbets,"So the shares that are being given to the other members are they just made from the company or do they come from the current float? If the answer is they come from the current float then could he potentially ask for them during the squeeze and drive the price up more? The article states ""at this time"" implying he could at a later date."
2021-04-08 19:25:33,wallstreetbets,They like the stock
2021-04-08 15:44:55,wallstreetbets,The ones that waive compensation are the worst. Their stocks never appreciate as much as shareholders would like.
2021-04-08 15:05:58,wallstreetbets,Maybe he would rather get $500k worth of shares when the share price comes down to reality.
2021-04-08 14:42:33,wallstreetbets,He doesn't think the price will go up. It's his job to make the price go up.
2021-04-08 14:14:15,wallstreetbets,He knows he will be a gazillionaire soon
2021-04-08 16:13:50,wallstreetbets,Getting paid in shares means you have incentive to increase the share price. Makes those board members kick it into gear instead of sitting around collecting checks like previous boards.
2021-04-08 14:52:20,wallstreetbets,World's first trillionaire

2021-04-08 13:50:59,wallstreetbets,Almost like he gets shares worth 180 per paid by you - regardless of whether it goes up.
2021-04-08 15:17:01,wallstreetbets,"Yes, but no.  If you are paid in stocks and you hold them for more than a year, then your tax rate is 15% regardless of the amount.  It's a tax move.  We would generate a gobble amount of taxes if we removed long term gains limit.

Edit: I'm wrong.  When you first get shares, they're taxed at the max rate (and adjusted when you file your taxes).  Any profits after they vest are subject to capital gains rates.  People ""living"" off of their long term gains are only paying 15% in taxes."
2021-04-08 13:02:47,wallstreetbets,I just promoted him to Admiral.

Literally still possible.

They take the stock as payment up front, then liquidate asap, then write yourself a massive bonus cheque.

Executives don't give a fuck about their salary, its all about bonus and stock compensation."
2021-04-08 13:56:58,wallstreetbets,Damn gotta be true
2021-04-08 15:38:57,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, funny how those new accounts and ones that haven't posted in years are suddenly so interested in GME."
2021-04-08 18:20:47,wallstreetbets,ERRONIOUS
2021-04-08 13:52:56,wallstreetbets,I mean... corporate leaders have always paid themselves in stocks that retail will buy - it's way more tax effective. Dilution can work by paying themselves cash or stock.
2021-04-08 19:19:37,wallstreetbets,Cohen has way too much at stake to ever do something like that. Sounds like pure FUD to me.
2021-04-08 13:25:48,wallstreetbets,"This was honestly something I was unaware of. With all the changes happening in leadership actually happening, and being confirmed, I found this very intriguing within this entire saga."

2021-04-08 14:19:31,wallstreetbets,"Also board wage compensation is pretty low. you don't get paid like executives, director wages for public companies are usually in the low six figures. Nice move but it's a token publicity move, it's not like he turned down ten million."

2021-04-08 15:37:04,wallstreetbets,"Is it though?

He's still taxed as income at the moment of the vesting. It's like he received the amount at market value and immediately converted into shares. So the 15% LTCG is applied only on the difference from the moment he took possession of those shares"

2021-04-08 15:37:55,wallstreetbets,Wouldn't ot be 20% cause he makes over 445k?
2021-04-08 16:49:57,wallstreetbets,"Yea, but if I was about to be a stock market trillionaire I‚Äôd probably want to limit my tax liability too."
2021-04-08 15:52:07,wallstreetbets,"No, you would just destroy capital markets.

I think it's a little concerning calling me ""M3ntally unstable"" so quickly, I guess you imagine yourself as the sane one in the room. the abusive language you used is not equal to calling you a shorter, you sound like a sociopath. it's mind boggling how easy it is for you to make fun of people living in section 8, and using the "" I used to be poor"" card thinking that makes it okay.

how can anyone trust you, you sound shady AF! I have a feeling your old post was BS, you created a BS story about being poor as a get out of jail free card when you insult someone for being one. I would assume someone who was poor would be more sympathetic to someone who is, but maybe I am retarded and your absolutely right, maybe its maybelline...

also, don't ""Stock Shame"" me, every other stock is boring AF, and I don't care enough to talk about any of them atm, I'm sure I'll change my mind later.

It was like 2016 ceo sent an email to the whole sales team. Everyone got the axe, they ran out of cash.

All my installs got fuxed.. they just never did them. Never got commission checks I was supposed to get as soon as they got installed. My contract with them was I would get paid when install took place. They just up and left. Said they were going operate only in a couple states now and would operate the sales team virtually and will not complete any installs except in a few states.

Fux them hate the company. 

I'm so confused cause the way I remember it was they had no cash at all. The ceo email was multiple pages long just said they needed to cut 80% of the companies payroll.

If they are still doing stuff virtual sales maybe the pandemic gave them a boom... but they are definitely not a semiconductor company and I'm really surprised they are still around.

2021-04-08 16:35:24,wallstreetbets,"Share recalls are done by the individual investor. If you own stocks in a company and are long, you can lend out your shares for a small %. When the stock is borrowed by someone else you can‚Äôt vote. Therefor if the individual investor wants to vote, he needs to recall his shares, forcing the one who borrowed it to buy the share or borrow from someone else. The share recall is more like a reminder, but it‚Äôs up to the individual investor to actually do it depending on if he/she wants to vote or not."
2021-04-08 16:54:18,wallstreetbets,What are they gaining on that?
2021-04-08 14:11:31,wallstreetbets,Precisely

2021-04-08 14:19:43,wallstreetbets,Could be

2021-04-08 19:02:01,wallstreetbets,But can't they recall their shares whenever they want anyway? Why do they need to have GameStop tell them to do it?

2021-04-08 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"HIMX Earnings Catalyst HIMX is a fabless semiconductor solution provider.

On Tuesday after hours HIMX pre-announced it‚Äôs preliminary 1st quarter key financial results.  It had ATH earnings.  1st quarter revenues, gross margin and EPS all exceeded guidance issued on February 4th.  Revenues, gross margins and EPS also all reached new peaks in the 1st quarter of 2021.

[apnews ](https://apnews.com/press-release/globenewswire-mobile/business-technology-products-and-services-asia-consumer-products-and-services-7333c43b2efc45168628b7fc244d8d58)

After hours on Tuesday and throughout the day on Wednesday the stock had a huge run up.  Towards the end of the day Tuesday and into after hours a sell off happened bringing the prices back to about where they started.  I also sold off all my options towards the peak of the prices.  Then bought more once the IV came back down.

HIMAXs actual earnings date is 5/5/2021.  I think because of the timing of the news release, most people weren‚Äôt able to get in on this event before the ramp up in price during after hours on Tuesday.  I believe a few days before earnings we‚Äôre going to see the same surge in the stock, possibly even bigger than Tuesdays since the earnings date is not surprise news.

This is not financial advice.  I‚Äôm just a smooth brained idiot.

TLDR:  HIMX...Yo, you got to get some of that shit!  But this ain‚Äôt no financial advice üöÄüöÄüöÄ

2021-04-08 18:34:47,wallstreetbets,The really weird part is my May7 14:50c are worth more than my May14 14:50c.  Has anybody seen this happen before?  I always thought the later ones would be priced higher due to the time value.
2021-04-08 12:33:59,wallstreetbets,"This stock has had a big run up since March 29. 3.00$ before the smaller runup of 1.50$.

Looks like ER is priced in. Unless it drops back to11.50$ I wouldn't expect a lot of movement come 5/5.

I expect short sellers to work on this stock do buying shares now seems like a bad idea.

If it goes back down you might get better options and strike price.

2021-04-08 18:39:54,wallstreetbets,Pltr is a shitty option for option trading with how volatile it‚Äôs been and completely random
2021-04-08 18:53:37,wallstreetbets,why gamble on pltr when you can gamble on spy... Like spy has a pretty decent chance to keep going up. Pltr? I doubt it.
2021-04-08 19:19:56,wallstreetbets,Just waiting patiently for PLTR to hit SNOW price.
2021-04-08 19:50:34,wallstreetbets,What did you lose 70k on?
2021-04-08 12:10:18,wallstreetbets,This is 100% why option trading should be locked for most people
2021-04-08 14:46:13,wallstreetbets,Thanks :(. I will be forever thankful

2021-04-08 14:43:02,wallstreetbets,I am a looser... What can you expect
2021-04-08 18:11:05,wallstreetbets,I didn't like this because I didn't want to spoil the 69 likes
2021-04-08 12:13:05,wallstreetbets,Most of these people are sensationalizing for clicks. Take it all with a grain of salt.
2021-04-08 13:22:55,wallstreetbets,"mate what i thought this is WSB

Seeing people going bankruptc with FD options on meme stocks is what barely makes up for all the spam here"
2021-04-08 14:44:10,wallstreetbets,I already did it... Can this hurt even more? I am just happy
2021-04-08 13:29:15,wallstreetbets,Tech stonks went down. Everything else did aight.

2021-04-08 16:14:07,wallstreetbets,I applied for option trading and they said no to me. I have to lose my money the old fashion way.
2021-04-08 17:14:46,wallstreetbets,Buy calls if you think it's going up. Buy puts if you think it's going down. Now you understand options.

2021-04-08 18:14:44,wallstreetbets,">Hard work without risk and luck is never going to make anyone millionaire. 

You're 24. If you start saving now in a retirement account only investing in S&P index, you most certainly can hit a million by the time you retire."
2021-04-08 17:36:36,wallstreetbets,I hope so!
2021-04-08 12:53:01,wallstreetbets,you can lose all of your money anywhere on anything

2021-04-08 15:24:04,wallstreetbets,Lol
2021-04-08 18:56:36,wallstreetbets,This is true. Literally no growth potential they already maxed out their market.

2021-04-08 14:10:31,wallstreetbets,This doesn't make sense for a purchased put... Unless he bought the put with margin in which case it would have been the price at the time that he bought it. Unless there is a typo in your comment it seems like you may not understand them as well as you think either...
2021-04-08 12:56:27,wallstreetbets,Yeah not happening... I know a little better to start that bad ;) 1 contract at a time
2021-04-08 14:26:39,wallstreetbets,I don't think you understand puts and calls either...
2021-04-08 14:41:44,wallstreetbets,He would have made money on 690 puts tho if he bought them when it was going up and sold at 50
2021-04-08 14:49:02,wallstreetbets,I still have hope

2021-04-08 17:02:30,wallstreetbets,Earnings is mid May as well.

2021-04-08 14:28:18,wallstreetbets,"I don't. Someoone should inverse this guy's trade. Puts on PLTR. All or nothing, winner takes all. Broker (house) takes small cut. Gamble.

When one of you inevitably post your losses on wsb, have the other person post their gains from the inverse position and rub it in the other persons face with ""thanks for wiring money to my account""."

2021-04-08 16:48:37,wallstreetbets,I am past that since I lost 30k on xpev calls.
2021-04-08 14:07:43,wallstreetbets,Do you tend to make more selling those spreads before expiration than just holding until expiration?
2021-04-08 17:51:28,wallstreetbets,"Thanks. Tbh, despite the wsb reputation,everyone is very friendly. I hope you will have a wonderful life."

He literally sold them wellllllll in the money when GME was like 150. 

He was posting because he was confused when he got a $207k bill when the options got exercised by the buyer. 

The thread got deleted sadly. Yuge mistake cost the dude a lot of money.  Total GUH moment when he realized what he had done.

2021-04-08 15:37:03,wallstreetbets,"Me too, I'm holding triple digit shares, but the last demo day, which was during market hours, was pretty volatile.  Ide assume the IV on your options will drop quite a bit on the 15th, pushing your premiums down."

2021-04-08 18:00:41,wallstreetbets,What can go wrong? You lose your remaining 12k?
2021-04-08 16:52:54,wallstreetbets,I am no financial advisor but next time maybe you should try to buy options that will increase in value. Its quite simple really.
2021-04-08 14:14:55,wallstreetbets,I sell early. Don‚Äôt want to be holding a short leg in case it somehow goes in the money on the last day
2021-04-08 15:42:34,wallstreetbets,Damnit!! I wish it didn't get deleted. Makes sense now i was so confused how this could even be possible with purchasing was thinking possibly a spread with pin or something. It amazes me how much margin people are able to get with close to 0 understanding of their exposure. Was he really expecting it to spike up to 3-400 without IV not spiking? Short of it shooting to like 750 there is no possible good outcome for this play XD. Let me know if you end up finding it i want to award the dude for his retardation.
2021-04-08 17:30:56,wallstreetbets,The last demo day started after hours at 4:30PM EST.

2021-04-08 15:42:12,wallstreetbets,"I wish I could. It would be really funny, but I'm tied up in other investments for the time being.

Also frankly I think you have to be a bit insane to buy puts on PLTR. If I currently had money I was looking to gamble I would be buying calls as well joining your team on [red vs green.](https://i.imgur.com/lmI18nv.png)"

I don‚Äôt think the guy was trolling though (or he‚Äôs a good troll).

No one understood how he was able to do what he did without collateral (or he had the collateral and wasn‚Äôt mentioning it).

In any case, the play was done, and the guy bought someone a Lambo."

2021-04-08 17:58:54,wallstreetbets,"this is one of the most retarded yolos I've seen in a hot minute. Far OTM on a stock that trades in a thin band? Check. Very short expiry? Check. Low volume on the contracts so you get ripped off on price? Check. Like just buy shares and forget about them jesus lol


EDIT: Delta is .0868 LMAO. If PLTR goes up $.5 every single day until expiry these will STILL EXPIRE WORTHLESS. thats 2%+ daily gains for 2 solid weeks....."

At this late in the game, a better solution is to buy on multiple brokers. Just evenly distribute. But at least 1 on every broker. That way if 1 mil is not a meme one of those brokers might allow a sell.

Fidelity forced me to send them snail mail to create an account, literally no other choice according to phone support and the website saying it as well, so I express shipped my information over and now I just need to wait for some info to settle to begin the transfer process.

2021-04-08 16:30:50,wallstreetbets,"Maybe because they think Fidelity is hideously ugly and unintuitive?

Maybe because Robinhood doesn‚Äôt ask for your dick size in order to let you trade options?

Maybe because they like free options?

Maybe they like that cash settles instantly and you don‚Äôt have to wait 4 days after selling to buy something new?

Maybe they like the 2.5% margin rate?

Maybe it‚Äôs the user friendly app?

Maybe they don‚Äôt think the same way that the reactionary hivemind thinks?"

2021-04-08 11:33:49,wallstreetbets,"Sure you legally own them via Robinhood, but if Robinhood doesn‚Äôt have them available to sell during the squeeze then you still lose out. Nobody is gonna buy them from you at squeeze prices a week later when Robinhood gets it‚Äôs act together. 

Maybe you could sue Robinhood for the difference, but they probably have protection against that in their terms of use."
2021-04-08 13:50:08,wallstreetbets,"When are people thinking the squeeze is going to happen? Is that what they think will happen April 20? I‚Äôm not very stock market literate & it‚Äôs hard to keep up with everything happening due to the jargon. I know what the squeeze is & that is has to do with forced buybacks, so I assume it‚Äôs happening on 20/4, I just want to make sure I‚Äôm not missing something.

Thinking of buying but after today‚Äôs announcement I worry it‚Äôs gonna be too late when I have the money together in a few days."
2021-04-08 13:04:18,wallstreetbets,Yeah I'd like to add a transfer from Webull took me over a month. Serious feet dragging from Apex Clearing and an absolute shitshow.
2021-04-08 13:14:03,wallstreetbets,Theres a post on here about brokers who fucked shit up last time
2021-04-08 10:46:45,wallstreetbets,Do you know where you are?
2021-04-08 10:47:59,wallstreetbets,"Hi there, allow me to introduce you to 2021."
2021-04-08 10:47:07,wallstreetbets,What crawled up your ass and died?
2021-04-08 11:02:22,wallstreetbets,"Because RH restricted trading last time the stock blew up, while other brokerages did not. The amount of trust people should have in RH is minimal."
2021-04-08 12:20:25,wallstreetbets,Ameritrade took 4 business days and transferred my options positions.  If you have options that expire soon they won‚Äôt transfer.
2021-04-08 15:06:35,wallstreetbets,Fidelity has S tier customer service. Makes me feel 100% confident in them holding my shares.
2021-04-08 16:53:09,wallstreetbets,"although i knkw it will last multiple days, Im scared ill still miss out. I wanna go into a local fidelity and talk to them there see if they can help"
2021-04-08 16:38:31,wallstreetbets,ui is simple for my monkey brain
2021-04-08 18:11:33,wallstreetbets,If you are using robinhood after what happened a few months ago you are unironically idiotic

2021-04-08 14:44:48,wallstreetbets,Aren‚Äôt you aware that we are still pretending that RH was the only broker to shut down trading?
2021-04-08 15:33:20,wallstreetbets,"Seriously, what the fuck is that about? 

This is the First time ive seen a notification from RH and im just like WTF."
2021-04-08 13:11:37,wallstreetbets,There‚Äôs a limit to how retarded we‚Äôre to appear
2021-04-08 10:50:03,wallstreetbets,"How about an actual reply with reasons why you disagree.

Oh wait everyone is retarded here, why do I expect anything other than an apey eye roll."
2021-04-08 15:21:22,wallstreetbets,"No, that‚Äôs a dumb ass"
2021-04-08 15:51:47,wallstreetbets,!remindMe a few days
2021-04-08 14:31:26,wallstreetbets,I'd be selling gme for tesla.
2021-04-08 13:08:34,wallstreetbets,Fuck off. Robinhood is shit. If I want to tell OP to shove his shares up his ass I can. Don‚Äôt tell me what to do.
2021-04-08 13:15:26,wallstreetbets,"Webull, ca and others use apex,
Rh supposedly is there own ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

But he is right, apex froze buying last time for anyone that uses them. Cash app even posted the letter from apex"
2021-04-08 10:47:26,wallstreetbets,"So... instead of a rollercoaster...

it's now a lazy river?

*gets out the inflatable tube and floaties*

Ah, what the hell..

*also gets some rum, cola, and some limes*

Gonna be here for a bit, might as well be comfortable!"
2021-04-08 16:48:14,wallstreetbets,How
2021-04-08 16:27:31,wallstreetbets,How long did the transfer take?
2021-04-08 12:30:03,wallstreetbets,I think that‚Äôs a charge from RH but fidelity can probably do that. Not sure. In my case they did but I transferred a good chunk of assets
2021-04-08 17:24:49,wallstreetbets,"Ape doesn‚Äôt know how to use currency symbol 
stand with ape, ape no fight APE!"
2021-04-08 16:28:44,wallstreetbets,Shorts want us to sell.  The more people selling the lower their price to cover.  Low volume once they begin covering hurts them tremendously.
2021-04-08 15:54:05,wallstreetbets,"""and you can't go back"" well yeah that's what they tell you, until they go ""you know what, we'll actually turn this back on for you, no need to thank*"
2021-04-08 12:07:49,wallstreetbets,"I agree with this point. Except, you can sell even if they don't have them on hand. It happens all the time. Robinhood is shady, so I wouldn't be surprised if they themselves do something to prevent you from selling.

They will probably have ""Technical Difficulties"" during the run up which will prevent you from selling. 

I agree with you that it would be a very very good idea to get off Robinhood to be safe."
2021-04-08 14:18:51,wallstreetbets,"It's tough to say when it will happen. Best bet is to research all you can until it starts making sense, watch the stock and see how it moves and make decisions on that. (Not financial advice, just an Ape with GME.) GME is so hard to predict, and setting dates has left people disappointed in the past. I personally try not to set dates.

It would be hilarious if it did moon 4/20."
2021-04-08 15:57:39,wallstreetbets,Why do people continue to ask questions like this
2021-04-08 19:18:38,wallstreetbets,Best bet is to stay far far away. Invest in a real company.
2021-04-08 13:05:59,wallstreetbets,Fuckin a. That‚Äôs ridiculous. Pretty sure you can still sell during right? It just rejects your transfer at that point?
2021-04-08 10:50:21,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm on Wall Street + Bets ... for Wall Street market loving gamblers that trade and do not give 2 fucks about anything but money - do you know where you are?

2021-04-08 12:23:10,wallstreetbets,Thanks
2021-04-08 15:08:21,wallstreetbets,"When I moved my portfolio over, it was pretty painless and they waived the 75$ fee. Took 5 days. 

Haven‚Äôt had any issues or needs to use their customer service other than to get the transfer started."
2021-04-08 16:20:48,wallstreetbets,As does Robinhood except their S stands for shit.
2021-04-08 15:07:42,wallstreetbets,wait you guys are being ironic?
2021-04-08 15:27:29,wallstreetbets,Unironic retard would be buying gme shares at $187
2021-04-08 15:06:31,wallstreetbets,No. I don't follow the current events
2021-04-08 16:24:03,wallstreetbets,üòé You just made $0.36 from interest üòé
2021-04-08 16:59:04,wallstreetbets,Same. Now I know why the word ‚Äúgamification‚Äù is being thrown around
2021-04-08 13:15:14,wallstreetbets,So convenience=lack of intelligence? Doubt
2021-04-08 10:54:20,wallstreetbets,"As it was once famously said


*You don't call retarded people retards. It's bad taste. You call your friends retards when they're acting retarded.*

Some of us here...who were here last year...just pretend to be retarded."
2021-04-08 13:14:18,wallstreetbets,Who is buying this guy a Lamborghini if his shares are locked up during the squeeze?
2021-04-08 16:38:01,wallstreetbets,"Literally nobody was talking to you, but Ok"
2021-04-08 19:52:28,wallstreetbets,"I was told I wouldn‚Äôt have to pay it by a rep, and I pursued that. Make sure to write down everyone‚Äôs name you talk to ALWAYS."
2021-04-08 19:52:55,wallstreetbets,Two days. Did it on a Monday!
2021-04-08 12:43:27,wallstreetbets,"It was a charge from Robinhood, yep."
2021-04-08 14:32:59,wallstreetbets,"Every time I try to submit to Fidelity, it always says ‚Äúsystem error‚Äù. Almost every day for the past 3 weeks."
2021-04-08 19:19:27,wallstreetbets,What a strange abbreviation for dollars
2021-04-08 12:36:39,wallstreetbets,"***they want you to sell***. Remember, they ***prevented buying*** last time. When all buying pressure is off, the price plummets. 

&#x200B;

If they halt buying again and drop the price, it'll be a shitshow."
2021-04-08 15:27:55,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I had a partial transfer and it took them a month to get to it, then by that time some options had expired so I had to submit a new form and just said full account transfer that time."

2021-04-08 15:32:56,wallstreetbets,They cancelled my transfer and I have no idea why ):
2021-04-08 16:47:15,wallstreetbets,How did you get the fee waived?

2021-04-08 13:21:05,wallstreetbets,Every broker has an app you retard. Your excuse for using RH is you like the pretty colors
2021-04-08 13:50:55,wallstreetbets,Not recognizing which factor is defining your lack of intelligence = (more) lack of intelligence
2021-04-08 11:02:04,wallstreetbets,"Okay.  Why are you defending a brokerage that has proven in action that they don‚Äôt own their stocks, we don‚Äôt own what we buy because of that. And they can stop trading of a stock if they so choose.

How can you defend that with an eye roll?"
2021-04-08 13:22:51,wallstreetbets,Lol not the fucker that stayed in Robinhood for three months and then decided to transfer the day of the squeeze LMAO
2021-04-08 16:03:40,wallstreetbets,Have you tried a different computer/browser? Cleared cache?
2021-04-08 12:46:56,wallstreetbets,"The last time I agree was to drop the buying pressure in hopes of dropping the price. I agree they would be insanely stupid to try that again. 

I meant in the midst of the MOASS they can have ""issues"" when you try to sell. It's going to be extremely expensive for them to cover everything. Wouldnt be surprised if they go bankrupt after the squeeze. But This is all my speculation. I could be wrong."
2021-04-08 11:17:04,wallstreetbets,"Right now I‚Äôm surrounded by future broke people, confused and disoriented, wandering around in echo chambers with blind folds on, following the voices of bots speaking like kindergarteners and promising dreams of getting out of your moms basement.

2021-04-08 12:52:25,wallstreetbets,"You‚Äôre mistaken, I‚Äôm not in GameStop anymore so I cant"
2021-04-08 17:02:31,wallstreetbets,"Fidelity takes care of it if your stock transfer is worth $2k or more. Whole process took me 24 hours.

Remember, RH nearly collapsed when the stock went over $400 per share..."
2021-04-08 17:03:48,wallstreetbets,"Pretty sure they waive the fee when your account value being transitioned from RH is worth $2,000+"
2021-04-08 18:54:42,wallstreetbets,I hated looking at my Robinhood notifications
2021-04-08 16:35:34,wallstreetbets,"And free options.

And 2.5% margin rate.

And instantly settled cash.

But yeah sure. It‚Äôs the colors. Whatever you say bub."
2021-04-08 13:22:56,wallstreetbets,"I have 4 accounts on fidelity, but I'm a gambling addict and I can't let my money sit long enough to transfer out tbh"

2021-04-08 11:10:39,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm eye rolling that this is a comment and how uneducated the comment is
2021-04-08 16:39:18,wallstreetbets,"Computer, laptop and 2 phones"
2021-04-08 11:19:22,wallstreetbets,This is coming from a currently broke person right?

2021-04-08 17:05:36,wallstreetbets,You request it after you transfer right? Not before
2021-04-08 18:15:29,wallstreetbets,wait is this true? I had to cover mine and had like 20k transfer
2021-04-08 14:34:21,wallstreetbets,4 accounts huh?  Sure..

2021-04-08 16:28:16,wallstreetbets,I'm starting to be with you. The longer this goes on the more I get the feeling that the shorts have worked out back door deals where they're going to cover with block purchases right from the MMs or some other off the exchange deal at an agreed upon amount that nearly bankrupts them but not quite and they not getting margin called now because they're hoping retail will loose interest. I have the worst feeling most of the retail is going to be left holding the bag.

Smug would make sense but would also mean you think I‚Äôll be right, so that‚Äôs why I wanted to clarify."
2021-04-08 16:39:46,wallstreetbets,"Most everyone had no context to the original play. The only reason we bought GameStop was the math checked out and we knew those MMs *didn‚Äôt know we knew*. As soon as it hit the news cycle the play was done. 

The only reason it‚Äôs still at $170 is because MMs want it to be. Retail 100% will be holding the bag, and at that point it‚Äôll be their fault. You can *never* attach emotions to trading. It‚Äôs the golden rule."

2021-04-08 16:53:18,wallstreetbets,"The shorts still haven't covered and the MMs attend going to margin call at this point until it hits a dollar value that they think will maximize their profit. But I have a feeling pay back is going to be all back room deals and minimal amounts of retail shares will be purchased to cover. I don't want to be the one trying to sell shares as the price spikes but the volume hits zero, I want the cash to buy 3 week out puts at that point."

The market runs off of predictions for the future, so even if they didn‚Äôt cover, and the interest is wrong - it still wouldn‚Äôt matter because it won‚Äôt squeeze if no one thinks it‚Äôs squeezing.

Nothing is ever certain, especially not in the stock market, most people will give up before it goes anywhere and the hedgies could eventually win (no im not a hedgie before im accused), if it seems too good to be true it probably is. Its insane the amount of money people are putting in and it sounds like 90% of people are putting money they cant afford to lose in.

I see stupid comments like 'italy is holding', this just means its inexperienced traders who are clueless and will sell out of boredom or panic.

Thats a lot of money you have at stake, be careful dude.

I know for a fact i will be accused of being a hedgie and i couldent care less, i just think this gamestop cult is very unhealthy and will potentially cost a lot of people a lot of money if it doesent take off (not to say it wont)"

Goodmorning Traders ... Snap back after 410 or before 410, that is the Question... my 4/8/21 Premarket outlook Technical Analysis on the SPY 

Snap back after 410 or before 410, that is the Question......¬†I will go thru the spy chart in the video below but looking at things this morning here is how to interpret things... 

Earlier this week I hinted that there would be a great opportunity later in the week for a contrarian type trade. That trade, I‚Äôve heard it called a snap back, as in the rubber band snapping back after it has been stretched to its limit. We have a great set up for it right now so let's get into today's outcomes.1) we hold support at the 407 area and¬†then break thru the 408.61 Area which opens the door to the 410/411 area. 2) We break thru support at 406area opening the door to 405 and below and retest of 406/407 would be a great time to short. 3) Consolidation between 408 and 405 before breaking higher or lower. 

1) we hold support at the 407 area and¬†then break thru the 408.61 Area which opens the door to the 410/411 area. **45% probability**

2) We break thru support at 406area opening the door to 405 and below and retest of 406/407 would be a great time to short.¬†**35% probability** 

https://preview.redd.it/qm31zbsy9yr61.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=e95fbbc81736eb94569b36bafb942ba4b3926702

3) Consolidation between 408 and 405 before breaking higher or lower. **20% probability**

Posts on r/WallStreetBets are \*highly moderated\* compared to other subreddits. We remove a tremendous amount of content every day.

Here's why:

* A submission should have been a comment in the daily thread (""Commentposting"")
   * **Text Submissions**: If your text isn't particularly useful, funny, long, or unique then it should have been a comment in the daily thread and not a submission. Submissions must add something new to the conversation.
   * **Image Submissions:** If your image isn't related to the markets and unique, then it probably doesn't belong on WSB. This includes posts like memes with simple captions, art, non-newsworthy screenshots, etc. If you have to rely on a comment or title, it's probably not a good post.
      * Gain / Loss  / YOLO Screenshots are the exception, and the minimum requirement here is a $2.5K change in value in options or $10K change in value in shares. YOLOs must be above $10K in options, or $25K in shares. Posts **must** include screenshot of positions, and comments **must** include rationale for why you made these particular trades.
* A submission contains misinformation
   * While we can't catch everything, posts that contain false or misleading information will be removed and the users banned. You're encouraged to demand the author for ""proof or ban"". If they can't prove a claim, tag a mod and the author will get banned.
      * Note: This only applies for things which are stated as objective facts.
* A submission contains NO-NO CONTENT
   * WSB is a big sub and to avoid us being shilled at every corner, we automatically remove content that mentions small cap stocks (Below $1B market cap), cryptocurrencies, NFT, and SPACs.
* A submission is purely political
   * Part of what makes WSB great is that we don't do politics here. No one cares about your political opinion unless it makes you money. WSB does not have an agenda or political goal.
* A submission includes advertising, self-promotion, fundraising or begging
   * Come on. I mean really. Make your money in the market, not off other WSB users.

You can find all this in more detail in [our rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/about/rules).

Breaking these rules often leads to getting automatically banned (by a bot) for a few days.

This isn't personal, we're just asking you to take a break and lurk the community for a little bit. We're... ""special"".

Video games are a socially accepted addiction and EVERYONE with money wants in on this exploding market involving the developing of Teams and advert contracts.

*  As you push prices up, you have more equity = more money on paper

With $20k, I'd top up the savings account to get some buffer against rough times.

With $200k my kids would also be getting a nice fund to get more easily started on their own homes when they grow up.

With $2M I'd also do some extensive home remodelling, give some handouts to my extended family and invest the rest in some sort of long-term fund with annual payouts to top up my current lifestyle.

At $20M and above? I'm drawing a blank here. There's nothing I really want in life that would ever require that much money. I'd probably just hand most of it out to people who need it more than I do."

Basically, he was able to create and believe a cohesive message between his job and his faith, which some find hard to do with finance related jobs. Reading your comment, it hit me... maybe his insane risk taking was some crazy belief that he either 1) had God on his side and was destined to keep succeeding and/or 2) maybe he wanted to become the richest man on earth and promote Christianity? There‚Äôs no doubt that being the richest man on earth would bring insane attention to him and his faith, but also, might help revitalize the Christian faith in modern society. Idk honestly just spitballing here, and yea I guess this is still a form of greed, but maybe it wasn‚Äôt greed driven by personal gain."

50 million and you and your generations are set for life. 

100 million and you have money to fuck around with. You could go literally buy Rodeo Drive just to turn it into a park if you wanted. 

500 million and you can go self-finance a major blockbuster film for 200 million and if it takes, still have **300 million** in the bank. 

1 billion? I mean, forget about it. You're into the kind of realm where you can own politicians and kill people and pay to cover it up. Now multiply that x 20.

Then you think shit why not keep going and try for a trillion dollars. And he probably has enough money stashed away still that he could just put it in spy and provide for his whole family. Yea it seems stupid after the blow up but when you consider the power that his momentum trades had and how quickly he was able to grow wealth it‚Äôs honestly insane. That 20B was only achievable by strait up solo bull raiding nyse stocks.

I‚Äôd retire and move to a penthouse and live the life we all saw on TV as kids. Yachts, jets, private employees, fuck it. EVERYTHING. 

Meanwhile this dude legit just pissed it away. Could have elevated entire communities, entire CITIES out of their poverty and debt. Could have sent hundreds of thousands, if not millions, to college. Could have invested in startups focused on things like clean energy and conservation. You could probably buy Rhode Island and have some change left. And he just pisses it away.

Or even comparing different insider trading, like politicians who insider trade while knowing how events are going to turn out because they are the cause/at the front of the line, and they only care about their own profits. now THOSE are the real scumbags."

2021-04-08 16:11:28,wallstreetbets,"Derivatives can fluctuate like stocks, so it can look like you're in the black today, but if you misjudge them they can wreck you. It's like buying stocks that force you to go long, ten or twenty or thirty years at a time. The swap trade market is essentially a bunch of people passing around hot potatoes. 

Rhose interest rates could be putting 5 dollars in your pocket one year, but suddenly begin siphoning 10 dollars out of your pocket the next year. Then 15 dollars the next year. Then 20 dollars the next year, and so on. If you based your worth on the income in that first year, you'd think you were doing well. Unfortunately, these aren't stocks. It doesn't just lose its worth when you bet poorly and get stuck holding the bag. It actively *takes* money from you when you bet poorly. It's like holding a bag full of leeches.

Fun fact: this kind of debt swapping tomfoolery is worth roughly $600 trillion worldwide. Everyone's in debt. Everyone's trying to not be the one who foots the bill. When the world economy implodes one day, it's gonna be because this shit went sideways. That's a row of dominos you do not want to see topple over."

I believe at this moment retailers own a huge amount of the float, but our funds are limited and as time passes we have less liquid capital to buy stock in significant amounts and hence,  the power to impact the price in a significant manner has been reduced, regardless of good news.

So I am ready to hold for as long as I have to, and I fully expect to see weeks/months of this flat/slightly downwards activity unless.

\-A whale steps in.

\-The hedge funds get their borrowed shares called back.

If we are right, and the hedge funds are in deep shit, they will keep fighting to live another day as long as they can, which is a long time, or until retail investors get bored and take their money elsewhere.

In other words, holding is easy.

2021-04-08 15:40:25,wallstreetbets,"Total Float has increased from 69,750,000 to 70,030,000 (roughly rounded).

That is a .4% increase, and something that I just noticed today, and as far as I know that can only change if the company issues new shares.

This is no way endangers the squeeze, being such a minor amount, but something that we as whole would do well to continue to monitor.

It does no one any good to ignore any changes, it's best we find out what it is and get the right information out to the rest of retail before FUD and media get another story out there.

If anyone has any resources that can explain the change please post it, or if I am wrong please correct me!

&#x200B;

EDIT:

[All I have to prove the float has changed is a screenshot from 4/1, check the uplaod date on imgur, it's from a week ago.](https://imgur.com/a/KydXloA)

A good explanation for this could be that these are shares that were issued to the new members of the board, possibly a vehicle to avoid messing with the free float.

&#x200B;

EDIT 2: Jenna Owings acquired 56,191 shares in a non-open market transaction sometime last week. I believe this supports the previous idea that the increase to the total float is just due to shares issued from the company directly to it's board members."

I long for the day they get margin called or have the rug pulled from under them by the DTCC/SEC (but also I keep reminding myself that they are only here to protect themselves while also to their best ability protect shitadel during all this to avoid a financial collapse).

1 - Click on My Account

2 - Scroll over to the history and statement section.

3 - Click on shareholder library.

4 - Click on the corporate actions tab.

5 - We should be given a proxy number and should be able to attend the meeting virtually.

I can't say for certain this works because nothing showed up for me... but this is what customer service as directed me to do. Also, I did this on the browser... I don't know how to do this on the phone application."

2021-04-08 14:57:21,wallstreetbets,"I think the reason for the the red day is due to uncertainty who the CEO will be (AKA this is truly just a mere dip). Let me explain.

You can argue that the stock price already priced in Ryan Cohen's involvement  but not as a chairman thus why the pull back and possible lack of volume. The whales haven't dived in yet because they're awaiting the news on who the CEO hire will be. But the stock will absolutely explode once the CEO is announced because the hire will likely have quite the resume.   


My ape tin foil hat confirmation bias laced theory:

Gamestop will announce the plans to announce the hiring of the  new CEO before 4/16. This combined with DFV exercising his options will likely maximize the stock price before the 6/9 meeting."

Yesterday ramping up at market close we had ~ 75m spent on Deep itm calls.

Today we woke up to a positive company press release.


And right near open had 20m++ spent on itm puts.

All options near expiry. 


Ideas - I dunno help.


1. It‚Äôs the same group buying both to control price (sus)


2. It‚Äôs opposing groups 


3. The calls are to acquire shares to dump the price, abusing some market making time mechanic.


4. The puts are to establish a sell wall.


5. Who is writing the covered calls? They seem to be covered because we aren‚Äôt getting buying pressure.


6. Is this extreme abuse of the options market?


7. If not, and it is opposing sides. Somebody reacted to the news and spent 20++ million on deep itm puts. Why else?

2021-04-08 15:50:06,wallstreetbets,"I bought in because a B&M pivoting into an ecomm changes the valuation by like 10x

Because Ryan Cohen beat Amazon at their own game and built a juggernaut, and now he's bringing the team to GME, not to mention owns over 10% of the stock so he's a believer, and he's a smart fucking dude

Because video gaming does more revenue than Hollywood and Sports combined and shows no signs of slowing (other than silicon shortage, that will pass)

Because Chipotle sells burritos and is valued at $1450/share and 40B MC, the claims that GME +$1000/share is too high are ignorant

Because earnings were off by $.01 and the 35% selloff in response was an obvious manipulation tactic

Because the media ignores GME when it's rocketing, and bashes it when it falls for one day, tells you who their masters are and that they're desperate to hide the ball

Because Gamestop is a reasonable company with financials that were never in a bad enough position to be shorted so heavily in the first place

Because Gamestop recently dumped their lamebrain CFO that only seem to know how to tank companies (for HFs)

Because Gamestop recently announced they are dumping the entire board and bringing in fresh, younger folks

Just off the top of my head.. there's a lot more, and not really about the squeeze at all, though I wouldn't complain, but I'm convinced GME will be 500+ in a year and 750+ beyond

This seems very good, one question if they are being entirely compensated in equities... They expect the squeeze to go on for months or they expect it will be bottomed out at that point and then will only gain value...???

2021-04-08 07:50:55,wallstreetbets,"Executive chairman	Edit
Executive chairman is an office separate from that of CEO, where the titleholder wields influence over company operations, such as Larry Ellison of Oracle, Douglas Flint of HSBC and Steve Case of AOL Time Warner (now WarnerMedia). In particular, the group chair of HSBC is considered the top position of that institution, outranking the chief executive, and is responsible for leading the board and representing the company in meetings with government figures. Before the creation of the group management board in 2006, HSBC's chair essentially held the duties of a chief executive at an equivalent institution, while HSBC's chief executive served as the deputy. After the 2006 reorganization, the management cadre ran the business, while the chairperson oversaw the controls of the business through compliance and audit and the direction of the business."

2. Amazing top notch & proven leadership is coming in & transitioning GameStop for the better. These are results we are already seeing with same day delivery & new competitive products being added.

3. GameStop has a new Chairman that has already proven to turn something small into something great.

4. If you have been paying attention, GameStop has admitted they are going to take advantage of the inevitable  without hurting retail.

Who knows, maybe it would work if they used it as their first weapon, maybe if the did it back in January they would simply shake us off, slowly, day by day... 

But they didn't. Instead they tried to beat us with baseball bats, fast and brutal. But you know the story, the MONKE became just more retarded and hardened.

Now their fuckin crowd control experts, 200iq professors of psychology from Oxford tier universities mother fuckers can't do anything, they've missed their opportunity. Now they have to fight full retarded battlescared zombie monkey, that came from 40$ deep grave and in respond to their super god tier mind manipulation techniques simple throwshit at them and make monke noises.

2021-04-08 08:13:55,wallstreetbets,"Could someone explain to a smoothbrain - 

I saw a lot of chat recently about how in advance of the AGM, there would be a full share recall. 
This would require all shares to be verified and thus require all short positions to be closed and squared away within the 10(?) day period. (??) 
This would trigger the MOASS. 

Assuming the above is vaguely accurate - what would happen if they didn't buy all the shares that they needed within that timeframe? 

ie, we're regularly told that 'we pick the price' because they NEED every share. But what happens if they don't GET every share in time? 
If person 'A' didn't sell their share within the 10 day window, hoping for more and more because 'they pick the price', what would happen to either them or the HF that needs that share if they miss the window?

Ryan Cohen founded Chewy and built it from the ground up.  It came up in direct competition with Amazon, and as of today, has a 33 billion market cap.

With GME, the entire board capitulated to him, and he is working with an already existing infrastructure that he can retool as needed.  There have been little drips here and there about Gamestop stores becoming tournament centers and getting into the business of selling more electronics, and offering high end equipment as well.  GME's market cap today is under 12 billion.

The last 3 days have been crazy low vol. Yesterday was the lowest volume day since Nov 2020, and today it wasn't even a quarter as much volume as the quarterly average. 

On no vol what you're seeing is nobody selling (otherwise volume would be much much higher) but HFs slowly trickling the price down. They **need** to make it look like an awful stock, and when the only activity happening is them selling it then it'll slide like this. They've had 3 wide open days to tank this and all they've brought it down to is $170. Think about that in the context of the SP even just a month ago. The price is *fake*.

This is bullish AF.

I believe the GME DD - at least what i can independently confirm.  I've seen the fuckery that's been happening to retail with my own eyes by the powers that be.  In my gut i know this is gonna moon but I just can't help but think that GME is gonna swindle me too; that another rug is gonna get pulled out from under me.  

That said, nothing in this life is guaranteed, buyer beware, blah blah blah.    The shares I own, like the measly $200, aren't going to make or break me financially.  It's the mf'in principle of the thing, ya know?

I do believe that what you put out into the universe will come back to you...i just hope these hedge funds get their comeuppance in this life, where I can witness it,  and not the next, amirite?

Did you read that, apes? THE DATE THE SHARES MUST BE RETURNED BY SHORTS, VERIFIED AND ACCOUNTED FOR TO RECORD YOUR SHARES.

YOUR SHARES. This is UP TO US!

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Contact your brokers and RECALL YOUR SHARES!! Tell them you want to exercise your shareholder rights in the upcoming shareholder meeting. ‚ö†Ô∏è

Keep in mind, Gamestop would probably need to have the 69.75 Mil shares accounted for (or however many are recalled) before doing anything important- as far as voting as a BoD. Like, oh idk, say... appointing RC as Chairman of the BoD? No this isn't a guarantee that anything will happen. But from a marketing standpoint, I sure as hell wouldn't be sending out PR without knowing for a fact things will be kosher enough to conduct business by the meeting date on 6/9 ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)

Inb4 naysayers say institutional whales don‚Äôt historically recall their shares and/or participate as voting shareholders in the annual meeting. WELL THIS YEAR IS FUCKING DIFFERENT HAS ANY OTHER YEAR BEEN THIS HISTORICALLY FUCKED?!

But just in case it does go according to historical trend...

Share recalls like to spark gamma squeezes.

If shares are required for a shareholder vote, Gamestop will send public notice this Friday or Monday as this is 60 days before the meeting date. Who knows what will come of this.

These dates are factual and documented, I am not making up my own target date or claiming anything here. Stay vigilant and do your own research!


Note:

- Yes you can still sell your shares if they are recalled. This simply means nobody is being ""loaned"" your shares. (To then take to the pawn shop like our boy Kenny G does.)

- You must be a current shareholder as of the record date to vote.

- We don't know what we're voting on yet, but im exercising my right to vote."

IMPORTANT NOTE TO GAMESTOP STOCKHOLDERS REGARDING VOTING THEIR SHARES AT THE 2020 ANNUAL MEETING:
GameStop stockholders who have loaned, pledged or hypothecated any of their Common Stock may not be able to vote their shares unless such shares are returned to their accounts before the record date. Due to the short interest in GameStop, it is possible that stockholders are not aware that their stock has been loaned by their broker. According to information GameStop has provided to custodial banks, brokers and other intermediaries, we believe GameStop has set a record date of Monday, April 20 for the 2020 Annual Meeting. Since shares on loan cannot be voted, it is imperative that stockholders who wish to vote at the 2020 Annual Meeting make certain they have their shares in proper voting order before the record date. It is important to know that this process may take several days to complete. Stockholders can call Saratoga Proxy Consulting LLC at (212) 257-1311 or (888) 368-0379 if they have any questions with this process.

By Luzi Ann Javier and Bloomberg Automation

(Bloomberg) --Updates with more details.

GameStop said activist investor and board member Ryan Cohen will become chairman of board following the company‚Äôs annual meeting, according to a press release.

NOTE: As part of a corporate overhaul spearheaded by Cohen, the company has brought in a number of new executives including a chief growth officer and chief technology officer, adding technology-focused senior executives to its team to move the company away from its brick-and-mortar business

NOTE: GameStop Adds Another Amazon Executive to Team; Shares Climb

The company also said it‚Äôs nominating six individuals to the board and directors will be compensated 100% in equity

In a filing with the SEC, GameStop also said Kurtis J. Wolf, a member of the board of directors resigned effective immediately and his departure was not a result of any disagreement with the company or the board

2021-04-08 13:46:21,wallstreetbets,"A poem to immortalize this glorious announcement:

Building up the clout, ignoring the media's impotent propaganda shouts. Even my broke ass is buying up GME, in incremental amounts. Now the truth this isn't hype is finally bursting out. Can't wait to try on an Armani suit and put my lips in a pout, before I color my text diamond on that Snap filter I'm about. Melvin barricaded the flood, thought they were causing a drought, but every ape is going to open wide when it bursts, and dispels all the doubts. Wash those juicy tendies down in your smooth-brained mouth.

Get on my rocket ship, and put these stonks in my pocket, quick. Swapped to Fidelity from Robinhood, so they ain't blockin' shit. I can't bury it as deep as DFV, so you'll have to get off on the tip. 

Raising middle fingers to media analysts, telling my employer I love to smoke cannabis, and since I don't have to work now, they can pick up the slack and handle this. Short attacks that barely tickled our sacks are all the hedgie squad manages. 

Listen to my IV tale, and come sit a spell. Behold Simba, that smoking heap beyond our land is Citadel. They're still interviewing the WSB mod from a year ago, which isn't sitting well, but only those who are here now can speak on the present casino, in which we dwell.

So let the bots naysay, and the plants badger me, let 'em be mad at me. I'm just relieved being broke and stressed is no longer what I have to be. 

Oh, and I was going to end this with proper punctuation, but wtf is an exit strategy"

Looks like the share recall can happen tomorrow or monday then (60d before the AGM). Looks like there is going to come some proxy statements (see the link in the post) that will be filed at the SEC, and that will be considered important for investor apes. Will obviously need to read them before going full wooooo fucking hooooo.

And hey US authorities and DTCC, if you are looking. Better get a move on hammering through those DTC/NSCC rules now. Get your framework to handle this apestorm in place. Rockets are launching.

2021-04-08 09:21:24,wallstreetbets,"I'm sure this is going to get buried, but as someone who has been with the company for three years this isn't great news to hear.  Cohen has made it clear that he wants to close a ton of the brick and mortar stores in favor of online sales and becoming similar to Amazon. Meanwhile, the website infrastructure is absolutely terrible and can not support such a move, at least in its current state. He has also been part of a big push to remove one of the management positions in stores that is vital to operation solely to save money. So we have went from stores closing due to bankruptcy to stores closing due to greed. It's like your partner with cancer going into remission breaking up with you to date someone better."

The only thing that made the squeeze viable was hedgies buying back from the float. Now the float just got diluted and hedgies can probably score some sweet deals directly from the company when buying back.

Don't get me wrong all of these things are good for the future success of the organization, but it means that short-term gains and squeezes are no longer in the cards."

That said... Diamond hands to the moon!

2021-04-08 11:01:53,wallstreetbets,I am amazed that even after months of retail investors buying all they can afford that the stock can still jump as much as it did.

2021-04-08 13:33:12,wallstreetbets,"It's a bit of an echo chamber in here so this won't be well-received, but objectively there's not really a chance of a short squeeze anymore.

In Jan, short interest was very high and there were lots of bets against GME. There were some catalysts that made the stock jump and then it started becoming popular on WSB which made it snowball. At this point, you had shorts covering, options writers covering, and WSB buying. This spiked the price to $500.

Volume was so high that brokers couldn't afford to make the trades, due to clearing house rules. Many suspended buying and since the price has spiked so much there was a huge selloff. 

At this point, shorts who had gotten in at low values had pretty much all covered and gotten out and short interest dropped significantly in the next month. Now you had a bunch of retail investors holding the stock for dear life and trying to sell the story that the squeeze was still coming. However, there just isn't enough sorry interest compared to float for that to happen. 

It was calm for a while; however, because there were a ton of options sold above the current price a small movement up could trigger another *gamma squeeze* where options writers need to cover but buying shares. This happened in late Feb, early March and the stock jumped. Holders felt vindicated and were given renewed hope.

Then in late March pretty much the reverse happened where a big selloff triggered a drop, although that was bought up quickly.

This brings us to now. A short squeeze is really off the table, but there is still a possibility for small gamma squeezes. However, keeping the price afloat and the possibility for gamma squeezes involves retail holding on hope that it will go to the moon. So we're now in a position where there is a meta story about us v hedge funds, conspiracy about attacks on the price, and every bit of news being bullish regardless of substance. Everyone wants to buy the story so it's just a matter of who tells it.

What happens from here? A rocky decline as enthusiasm drops over the next months or maybe years. Little spikes to keep up hope but an overall descent into a somewhat normal valuation. If you time the ups and downs right you could certainly make money, but it's not ever going to actually go to the moon or even hit $500 again in my opinion. 

The company may turn around and become profitable, there's no real sense in investing in that play because it's overly priced in right now. To justify the current valuation looks like a *very* successful e-commerce business so to buy in now is expecting it to be a *very very* successful business. Possible, but the risk/reward really doesn't align when you think it could also just dwindle to $5-10 over the next two years quite easily."
2021-04-08 11:28:34,wallstreetbets,"The price has slid down for the last couple of weeks, anyone short is in a better position now.
Borrow rates are historically low, and according to this group the 480 spike didn‚Äôt get anyone margin called.

So in order for the shorts to be forced out you need to spike the price beyond 480 at the very least, otherwise there‚Äôs no forcing them out"

The CEO makes the day to day decisions that are critical to the company, all the board does is fire the CEO when he isn't doing a good job.

That's why this is selling off - it is NOT good news.   RC needs to be CEO, the fact they didn't announce that means it isnt happening anytime soon."

2021-04-08 09:56:40,wallstreetbets,"> Better to release the stock they want to sell for a quick $1b, and then recall the stock.

The $1b valuation requires a \~250 share price iirc, and it also doesn't really make sense from a strategic perspective to sell that many shares before recalling them because that would likely lower the price and make it harder to get the full valuation.

Seems like the better strategy would be to recall shares, let the price spike and then sell shares - it would require significantly less shares to be sold and would avoid any yo-yo effect caused by additional liquidity."
2021-04-08 17:14:06,wallstreetbets,"In the event of a recall, how long is the timeline from announcement of a recall until actual figures are known/fake shares are gone?"
2021-04-08 10:59:19,wallstreetbets,"Most people commenting here clearly don‚Äôt understand it either. 

As a shareholder, you have the right to recall any shares that you have lent out in order to execute voting rights. So if any of the board members have shares that have been loaned out, prior to a board meeting they can recall those shares so they have their voting rights at the meeting. I think the question here is how many shares do the major shareholders have on loan right now. 

I‚Äôm also not sure why this is being talked about as something that would kick off a short squeeze, but I imagine the theory is that short sellers have been naked shorting or using other nefarious methods and it might be hard to locate all the shares they‚Äôve sold short. But somebody recalling their lent shares doesn‚Äôt really involve the short sellers, it is a transaction w whoever purchased the shares from the short seller, bc they are the ones holding the voting shares. A lender recalling their shares may forcefully close the short position though, at least temporarily, I‚Äôm not entirely clear on that part. 

But share recall is not something GameStop can just do as a company, it‚Äôs a personal decision among all shareholders w voting rights who have loaned shares."

2021-04-08 08:03:01,wallstreetbets,[Fuck you‚Äôre right](https://images.app.goo.gl/UJDCsW8e3RKjv8vX6)
2021-04-08 08:49:33,wallstreetbets,"Disagree. Practically dumping *all* of the old guard and embracing Ryan Cohen - someone with a proven track record for profits and revitalization - along with others is not mere ‚Äúrestructuring of their organization chart‚Äù. If it was simply kicking out a few people, sure, it could look like people bailing out of a sinking ship, which is what HFs bet on happening - that‚Äôs not the current scenario.

Cohen and all involved are too intelligent to jump into a sinking ship. If one was just being cynical and saying ‚Äúoh, they‚Äôre just trying to turn a quick profit and then bail‚Äù, I could understand that more than the concept that this is somehow all intangible and blowing hot air."
2021-04-08 10:14:44,wallstreetbets,"I actually think it‚Äôs the opposite, and common people are way too willing to throw all their money into something that brands itself as e-commerce. Blockbuster tried to shift itself into e-commerce and streaming towards the end there, too, and that didn‚Äôt exactly work out."
2021-04-08 09:33:46,wallstreetbets,"No argument that it has been a garbage company. But enough changes are occurring that give a strong indication that it will, at the very least, adapt and survive in a digital-first business climate; Amazon provides a template to adapt and compete with - what other competitors are there? So to be bearish on the future prospects? To each their own. But out of business in 10 years with the complete restructuring from Cohen‚Äôs team and raising capital in preparation for a transition to e-commerce? Illogical."

2021-04-08 10:11:22,wallstreetbets,"I probably wasn't quite clear. Most Gamestop stores are profitable. Every few months they close the ones that aren't. So that part is understandable. But what Cohen wants to do is close the stores, profitability be damned, in favor of having select stores with limited stock that you go to to order stuff in person while the few remaining stores have their storefront shrunk in order to have higher stock so they can act as intermediary shipping locations to supplement warehouse shipping. Stores already do this as is. I would agree with consolidation of assets if it made sense, however Cohen is pushing to close stores and retool the company even though the company is in a spot to succeed as is."

However, it doesn't matter how much money they make if I and a ton of other employees lose their jobs in the process. It's like getting punched in the face so someone else can make a million dollars from it. It's preached all the time how people should be loyal to companies, yet no one cares about Gamestop being loyal to long time employees."

I figured if borrowed shares are a certain % of the float, then when the shares need to be bought then the float holders can dictate the price.

If the float gets bigger, I assume the power the common shareholders have is reduced?"

The type of people competent enough (and likely ambitious enough) to rise up into positions of power like that tend to not be ones who want to recognize when they cant handle something. So it is somewhat to his credit that he could manage that"

It‚Äôs amazing how stupid this sub is. the ceo answers to no one. they do their jobs as the top executive and manage the business to the best of their ability. If the board doesn‚Äôt like that, they can request a vote to fire the ceo but need a majority assuming the ceo also is not a majority shareholder. the chairman or the board almost NEVER intervenes in the CEO‚Äôs business for any reason other than to represent their shareholders interest."
2021-04-08 10:42:23,wallstreetbets,"Idk why everyone thinks he would even be interested in being the CEO. The guy is busy af w other investments and companies, there‚Äôs no way he‚Äôs taking a full time job managing GME operations as CEO"
2021-04-08 09:13:20,wallstreetbets,"Sure, they absolutely do.

But let me ask you this ...would you, as a member of the board, accept 8000 shares, currently valued $180($1.44m total) as your salary, just for it to crash down to $40, meaning you only made $320k this year? Of course you fucking wouldn't. That would be retarded. Or imagine the price skyrockets to $20k each. You accepting your salary of 72 stock? Of course not. Because tomorrow it could be worth $40k each, or  $25.

You don't accept equity as your salary unless you know the price will settle somewhere, so that your salary makes sense for your title.

And that price will not settle till AFTER the short. Until then, it's swinging up and down like crazy."

2021-04-08 10:01:38,wallstreetbets,"I may be missing something, but does Ryan Cohen have a ‚Äúproven track record‚Äù outside of Chewy?

I mean, what he did there is phenomenal, of course, but I‚Äôd hardly call one successful company a ‚Äúproven track record.‚Äù

EDIT: For an example of why I‚Äôm skeptical, look at Meg Whitman. She led eBay during the late 90s and through the 2000s as it grew massively. She then left eBay to lead HP, where the company underperformed expectations, and then she became CEO of Quibi, one of the biggest flops in recent memory.

Maybe Ryan Cohen won‚Äôt end up being like Meg Whitman, but the point is that growing one company into a massive success does not automatically mean he‚Äôll be able to replicate that success anywhere he goes."
2021-04-08 09:57:58,wallstreetbets,">what other competitors are there?

Well, Steam is a big one. Plus, if you play on console, you can just buy most games directly through the console‚Äôs online store. Why would I buy a Switch game from GameStop when I can download it directly from the Nintendo eShop?

Maybe GameStop will successfully transition into the hardware side of the business as others have speculated (focusing on things like PC parts), but again, there are plenty of other competitors in that market, too.

Also, it‚Äôs worth pointing out that, just because a company improves its prospects in the future, doesn‚Äôt mean its stock price will move the same way. Maybe GameStop will become a huge player in the market again, but it‚Äôs important to remember that the price for the stock was in the teens/single digits before this whole short squeeze.

So even if the stock price ends up settling in at $80, that would be MASSIVE growth from where things were just a few months ago, but still a MASSIVE drop off from where we are now."
2021-04-08 13:29:46,wallstreetbets,"Well they have to fight Target, Wal Mart, Steam, Amazon. Pretty stiff competition tbh. When you buy a game, where do you go? I use Steam and see 0 reason to switch. Do you think millions will switch, because that's what it will take to be valued at 100-200 logically, even thats probably exaggerated."
2021-04-08 10:48:19,wallstreetbets,"Right the board is above the CEO but their power is basically limited to firing the CEO if they don't like what he is doing.   

The CEO makes all the actual business decisions that are critical to a company that wants to undergo a transformation from B&M to eCommerce.

RC needs to be hands-on in the transformation, I suspect the fact that he is only going to be Chairman means he didn't want the job otherwise I'm sure they would have given it to him."

2021-04-08 12:57:44,wallstreetbets,Who said GameStop??? I said share recall. The major shareholders like Fidelity and Blackrock will likely recall shares if they want to be involved in a shareholders meeting that involves redistribution or awarding of shares new execs and board members.

Corporations cannot recall shares - that's something that only lenders can do.  If a corporation wants to compensate a board member with equity, the corporation must either issue more shares or buy back shares on the open market."

As for price, absolutely - this bubble is going to pop. But the long term price settling will still be good for the company."
2021-04-08 13:36:36,wallstreetbets,"Steam isn‚Äôt much in terms of competition for several reasons. The number of casual console gamers outnumber PC gamers. Epic Games already proved that it‚Äôs easy to scalp Steam‚Äôs user base despite providing an inferior interface with practically no support. Finally, Steam is not hardware-focused outside of niche VR, whereas GameStop is already integrating GPUs and looking to expand; I love Steam, but it‚Äôs not in the same sector as GameStop.

The other companies you mentioned *are* competition, but they‚Äôre not specialized. There‚Äôs the opportunity to make a foothold there and expand. Will they? We‚Äôll see."

2021-04-08 15:15:19,wallstreetbets,"The same logic applies to the ‚Äúall star team of execs.‚Äù Just because someone worked for Amazon as Amazon became one of the biggest companies in the world doesn‚Äôt mean GameStop will automatically see that same success.

Do those additions mean the company will do better from here on out? Sure, their hirings are definitely reasons to feel bullish, but do their hirings GUARANTEE the success of a company that had been floundering in recent years? Of course not.

And even if they do help to legitimately revive GameStop, does that mean GameStop will be anything close to what it‚Äôs trading for now? Absolutely not. The price is heavily inflated due to the short squeeze, and if it settles in long-term at $70/share, that‚Äôll be a massive improvement from where it was 3 months ago but a massive downturn from where it sits now.

If you believe the squeeze is not yet squoze, then, by all means, continue to hold, but if you‚Äôre putting your eggs in the ‚Äúnew leadership will grow the company to 10x where it was 3 months ago,‚Äù then I think you need to adjust expectations."

This is absolutely not true.  You are entitled to every corporate action, or to be made whole for every corporate action, while your shares are on loan.

If a dividend is paid, the borrower has to pay you a manufactured dividend.  If there's a stock split 2:1, the borrower now owes you two shares for every one they borrowed.  Scrip dividends, mergers, tenders, everything.  You won't get them directly, but the borrower is required to acquire shares or pay you cash in order to make you whole, as if you had never lent them out.

Proxy votes are the only exception ‚Äî because you can't ""pay"" someone a vote, nor can you give anything else equivalent to a vote.  A vote is a vote, and if you miss your chance to vote, that's it.

Nothing I said goes against any of that.  Not sure what you mean by ""redistribution"", though.

My point was, a share recall isn't something that's just going to happen ‚Äî it's not a corporate action; it's a decision that shareholders may or may not make.

[They didn't recall their shares last year, though.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-investing-giants-gave-away-voting-power-ahead-of-a-shareholder-fight-11591793863)

It's unlikely they would recall their shares unless they thought the vote was going to go against their shareholders' interests otherwise.  If it's an uncontroversial proxy, a share recall is unlikely ‚Äî  I don't know if any of the votes are controversial.  A pay cut is never going to get voted down by shareholders, though."

2021-04-08 14:00:31,wallstreetbets,"Who the fuck else is going to lending your shares?  It's going to be either your broker or a lending agent \(and your broker would still be the principal\).

Your brokerage doesn't make you whole, the counterparty does.  Nobody would ever lend shares out if you missed out on every corporate action that happened while your shares were on loan.  This is basic securities lending."

I‚Äôd wager less than 30% of people who are posting in the megathreads even own GME. So it‚Äôll be a filter, with more people being left who are actually invested in the sub."
2021-04-08 13:40:28,wallstreetbets,"Loss porn is not the same thing as denigrating others for being involved with a stock despite the amount of success it brings. Loss porn is laughing (hilariously) at the idiots who are buying 800c GME that expire tomorrow; there‚Äôs people who take advantage of a stock, and then there‚Äôs people who ride the wave of the same stock for karma and ‚Äúlookit how much money I have‚Äù crap. Regardless, WSB‚Äôs ‚Äúentire purpose‚Äù has not been solely loss porn."
2021-04-08 13:33:45,wallstreetbets,">Members of the board are: CEO, CFO, CMO, CIO, COO, etc

That is not correct in this case and varies from company to company, many companies do not have any C-level executives on the board.

I checked GME and the CEO is on the board but none of the other C-level executives are, including the CFO : https://news.gamestop.com/corporate-governance/highlights

The fact remains that the board is not involved in any day to day operations of the company."

2021-04-08 07:31:11,wallstreetbets,The Answer Is: DIAMOND HANDS
2021-04-08 12:32:42,wallstreetbets,"Here is my game plan: 

1) as it climbs $450: no panic sell...just hold

2) as it tank back to $300: I start suspecting I'm a moron

3) wait! it's climbing back to$500: what DFV would do in my place? Hold!

4) we ramp up very quickly to $1.000: wasn't this my previous target?

5) while I'm still mumbling it goes $5.000: me trying to understand who am I

6) meanwhile the $10.000 come: I'm a truly Ape!

7) $15.000: Let's see where we do want to peack

8) all around the market is collapsing: my Google & Apple tank 60%

9) While GME flyes $20.000 CNBC is declaring that you shouldn't trust these adventurous stocks if you are not a fool: I'm considering their words; sound it makes sense

10) all at a sudden Jim Cramer quit with CNBC and announces to the world he invested his retirement savings on GME stonk. He declares "" I like the stock"". I think that it's never too late to redeem yourself.

11) as we touch the $50.000 ps I'll go out for a walk, in order to release some tension and to think about Greta Tumberg words.

12) When I go back to the desk JPowell is explaining very calmly that the Federal reserve went bankrupt and the country is fucked for the next 10 years. He also informs that some truly Apes just wrote him to say they want to borrow some tendies to help"". 

13) Finally, when the tide lowers back, I'll sell 1 stock for 1.000.000 and keep the rest in my account...because in the end I like the stock."
2021-04-08 07:30:59,wallstreetbets,Every morning I wake up with intense excitement to check the price. And then everyday I say we're not there yet guess I'll just hold. And I will keep doing this routine until we're at an acceptable price... and then I'll hold a few days after that to make sure we squeeze. Then I'll figure out how to readd my sell button and then think about buying a few more.
2021-04-08 07:26:51,wallstreetbets,Nice work ape!

i dont have that xbox anymore and i dont have my dad anymore, and to be honest, i dont even fucking like gamestop. probably only would have gotten a couple bucks for the xbox, even less for my dead dad.... but i like the stock."

2021-04-08 15:15:49,wallstreetbets,"my thoughts at the moment:

and please hear me out. compared to the minds on this site I have zero knowledge on how the markets work so im gonna give you my blue collar simple perspective, im in construction by the way so I want this GME thing to work out as much as anybody! but as a 50 yr old I've seen my fair share of fucked up shit. sooo you have to bring into question that how has GME avoided  every one of these ""significant dates"" that we were all hyped up on, the Quadruple witching day,RC conf call, 3/21, end of month, blah blah.....and the stock did nothing but go down or stabilize. so if its a battle of control are we winning? in my mind I don't feel like we are, now the new ""significant"" date is June 9th what happens if this stock goes on the trajectory its going on and  by early June its trading at $125 and June 9th it spikes at $200 and were all supper happy but were still at sq 1... rinse and repeat????? is it me???? but how are there no deadlines on something of this magnitude , leads me to believe that this is a "" them vs us"" its just extremely wealthy institutions exchanging money back and forth.. and their goal is really to keep it from us apes.. I have 7k invested so if I lose it, it will sting a little but ill be ok..and I think the hedgies better recognize that if they don't play fair it would not fair well for them.. there are a lot of people worldwide that really have their hopes up for this to happen, this is life changing for a lot A LOT of people that actually wanna do good things for their families and community. we see the glimmer of light and were not stopping! it would be in their best interest to play fair... this is high stakes for a lot of us and ""were all in"" u could only slow roll for so long!!!!  ohh and by the way why does every post have to say ""this is not financial advise, im not a financial advisor""  fuck them why are they allowed to do it who fkn says??????their gonna tell me what to do with my money??? ill take this place for financial advise before and institution! fuck off. their whole institutions are built on lies a deceit!!!!

2021-04-08 12:47:50,wallstreetbets,"The way the market works: Market Makers are not a warehouse. You buy a share from the MM, the MM is actually shorting it to you. The MM and his buddies manipulate the price lower so they can buy it back lower and in theory make a tiny profit. But what happens if no one is selling and only buying is going on... The price keeps going down. This is how you get GME and Telsa. Buying causes the price to go down. Selling shares causes the price to go up, which is even more criminal, because the MM is buying the shares then manipulating the price higher for the MM to sell at a slightly higher price. Now the MM owns some shares that he has manipulating higher and the bank is giving him more margin based on the stock he now owns. But what if no one is buying what the MM needs to sell? The price keeps going higher with no one actually buying. This is how you get stocks like NetFlix going to the moon. Owners selling on a schedule... This is not price discovery. +130% short interest from the MM who is charged with taking care of your companies stock price is criminal. In my humble personal view 30% short should be a legal limit. People invest in a company with the intent that it benefits the company. This MM machine causes your investment to hurt the stock price. 

What would happen if traders requested physical deliver half of their shares to their home? It wouldn't be pretty. I also have a big problem with trading platforms offering ""Free"" trades by feeding the order flow to these sorts of MM's. They are clearly not acting in the best interests of their clients.

 Full discloser: don't listen to retards on WSB this is 100% speculation."

2021-04-08 07:19:56,wallstreetbets,"There are brokers that let you set conditional orders. TDA lets you set up conditional orders with an expiration date of whatever I want to sell at whatever limit I want. I'm not experienced and not familiar with which other brokers do this, however."

2021-04-08 08:35:48,wallstreetbets,You can try setting a sell limit order for $420M per share. Just be aware that some brokers won‚Äôt let you set them for a certain % over what its current market price is.
2021-04-08 11:31:07,wallstreetbets,You set your order as Good Til Canceled. That‚Äôs usually good for 30 days

Our persistence flings shit all over the notion that the market is somewhat predictable, that hedge funds and brokerages know what they're doing. If we win, they lose credibility as well as a shit ton of money, both of which scares the rest of the market."
2021-04-08 10:02:15,wallstreetbets,"Right! Kind of reminds me when gold hit 2000 several years ago. Everyone and their brother on tv and radio was yelling ‚Äúbuy gold, YOU SHOULD BUY GOLD!‚Äù  But years before that when it was 200-500 or what ever. There was barely a peep. But at 2000. You must buy buy buy. Now with the people getting band off platforms, constant barrage that these stocks aren‚Äôt good, stay away and so on. More are seeing that these people aren‚Äôt on the regular people‚Äôs side at all.

2021-04-08 15:13:52,wallstreetbets,"Yeah i think most people that are left in this are the actual diamond handers. Everyone who had a short term gain interest, has paper handed already. I put into this what i ""don't mind"" losing and it seriously doesn't matter to me how far it drops. If the price drops back to 40... Well tough titties, then I'll keep holding for months if need be, until the raid is called off."
2021-04-08 17:34:07,wallstreetbets,"Yes, this isn‚Äôt the hedge funds first rodeo they are going to do everything they can to try and slip out of the squeeze, but we have the power and silly things like this video keep us united :)"

2021-04-08 11:21:48,wallstreetbets,"Way better than me.  I just found out about this whole thing about a week ago (week ago) and got in at 183.

It will be irrelevant in the future what we got in at though."
2021-04-08 12:09:41,wallstreetbets,I created a throwaway youtube account for this purpose. You can use a youtube downloader to get [the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VePpLIYWGdc).
2021-04-08 13:34:37,wallstreetbets,"Imagine I loan you a super rare Pok√©mon card. Immediately you go and sell it to someone else. Then you borrow the card from him and sell it to another person. Then you do that over and over.   
Eventually, you get a call from me, telling you I want my Pok√©mon card back. But you don't have it. So now you have to go to the last person you loaned the card and buy it back since this is a very rare card and only one copy exists. But that the last person you loaned that card is like ''nah I really like this Pok√©mon card, I don't wanna sell it"".  


But you HAVE to return the card so you have to buy it back from that person no matter the price. Then you have to do the same thing over and over and deal with each person you sold and then borrowed the card from. Now you're screwed because that's like ten people you sold the card and borrowed back and they all legally own the card but there is only one card in existence.   
That's what he is referring to when he's talking about the ''fake shares'' and institutions claiming ownership of 200% of all the shares, retail holding 100-300% of the shares etc."

2021-04-08 07:27:27,wallstreetbets,"How come nobody mentions is the current shorts are no longer from below $40 prices. My guess most are from the $300+ a couple weeks ago.

Am I wrong? Does it not matter?"
2021-04-08 07:16:22,wallstreetbets,"These calcs are not worth your time. Shorts don't have to report SI like other holdings. Any company estimating SI is guessing, and probably in the bag for the hedgies. 


Ask yourself when they had the volume to cover 140%+ of float? They just haven't. Even if they have been buying every share sold since late January the volume still doesn't exist, and we know retail is still adding shares and we also know institutions think they own 140m shares when there's only 70m in float."
2021-04-08 06:54:40,wallstreetbets,Let them ignore reality and follow their fantasies. It's entertainment at this point.
2021-04-08 12:03:43,wallstreetbets,Shorts still aren't covered. Read the DD.
2021-04-08 15:18:33,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm reading a book written in 1923 and in it the stock manipulator who made (and lost) equivalent of hundreds of millions multiple times talks about the exact behavior we‚Äôre seeing here, specifically that some people only buy into a stock once it has a short squeeze and will hold shares for years even after they lose half their money thinking it‚Äôll squeeze again.  Difference is back then you could get 9 to 1 margin so if you bought at $400 you would‚Äôve gotten blown out when the stock fell under $150."

It's a game of chicken. The shorts want us to give up so the price will drop and then they'll cover for a big profit if they entered while it was in the $300s and $400s. If we can get the price going up again or even just hold it at a higher price than they'd like they could give up first, not wanting to be fucked by another squeeze."

2021-04-08 17:41:38,wallstreetbets,You have to set a contingent order. I set a contingent that says once stock price hits X then execute a limit for y.
2021-04-08 15:50:18,wallstreetbets,Ran into this bullshit as well
2021-04-08 10:08:45,wallstreetbets,"Go [here](https://invest.ameritrade.com/grid/p/site#r=conditionalOrder) on desktop. Set ""Condition"" to Conditional Order (trade trigger). Set the symbol to GME. Set Criteria to Bid. Leave qualifier as Greater Than or Equal To. Set Amount to what you want to trigger your order at, ~~say $10,000,000 or so~~ somewhere around market pricing (GTC+ext orders will stay for 30-90 days depending on your broker). Leave Activity to Submit a Stock Order. Action=Sell, Quantity=how many shares you want to sell, symbol=GME, order type = limit, time-in-force=GTC+extended, date=today, email=your email, Set to Expire On= set this to a future date so this conditional will stay there until whatever date you set.

This is not financial advice, just a quick how-to regarding conditional orders. Hope that helps.

EDIT: OH I forgot to mention, these seem to be capped at $9,999,999. TDA gives a digit error if you do anything greater :(

EDIT2: correction"

2021-04-08 10:37:39,wallstreetbets,Wouldn‚Äôt setting the trigger at the current market price actually be better because it would be a LIVE sell limit order versus a conditional and also possibly keep the shares from being borrowed/shorted?
2021-04-08 15:10:51,wallstreetbets,"Funny thing everyone trying to set limit sell now while price is low.. Why not just wait until the price starts going up and as it does it will get closer to your sell price limit you want and it will then ""allow"" that to be set. Then wait for it to hit and go through. Just seems like a lot of effort trying to set your price right now before this actually starts. If you wait you don't have to worry about it possibly expiring before hand. Just like he said in the video "" no one knows when this is going to happen"". If your limit expires in say 90 days and it does not move until after 90 days you went through the trouble of setting it for nothing. Just sit back, relax, eat some tendies and enjoy the ""in-flight movie"" until launch time.


Ps. I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advise."
2021-04-08 15:42:18,wallstreetbets,It's just not as much fun without some risk. I'm addicted I'll be honest lol
2021-04-08 15:16:06,wallstreetbets,"Wouldn't that be beautiful if the whole system tanked so that GME goes to $420,690 a share. Everyone but the apes poor AF."
2021-04-08 14:46:36,wallstreetbets,"Not exactly, they are still paying premiums the longer they hold, meaning even if they were in the green on some of their short entries if they went in high, those profits would be being eaten by premiums. 

Also, supposedly the maths suggests they couldn't have covered all the short positions, meaning the majority is probably still bleeding from this, even at 'lower' prices - they might have averaged up(?) by entering new short positions at the top, but I don't see how when there was supposed to be 140% SI every single one of those shorts was covered and the price only went to the $400s.

Basically, the higher the price sits, the more likely shorts are going to fold and cover, but that doesn't mean it won't happen while sitting at a lower price. 

I personally am still confident we will see a proper squeeze, but no one knows when it's going to happen as we are in a game of chicken with the hedgies based on who caves in first, though it should be noted that we don't have to pay to hold stock, they do have to keep paying to hold short positions open."

I was wrong here; GTC+Extended doesn't expire at the end of the day. Brokers usually let these run on for 30-90 days. Setting a limit near the market price sounds like a good idea.

I don't have a link or anything confirming this but my friend said that shares with conditional orders cannot be borrowed."
2021-04-08 17:27:00,wallstreetbets,Because then you might be able to snipe a huge share price waaay above the current marker value
2021-04-08 15:15:47,wallstreetbets,I set my expiration date for August. The conditional in place I believe also means your stock cannot be borrowed.

2021-04-08 15:24:15,wallstreetbets,"If it is true that it allows it to become ""locked"", then this is only reason I see for it. If this is not the case, then I keep my full original thought. I would like to know how my stock can be ""borrowed"" without asking me first. Only ones that should be able to be ""borrowed"" are the ones the companies themselves own. Otherwise I want a cut in on the interest accrued for this borrow that has taken place. Anyone else want some interest?"
2021-04-08 19:46:20,wallstreetbets,"Don't know why you're saying it like that as if I pulled it out my arse for no reason. You spoke about it having to go to over $400 as if you were trying to spread FUD by making it look like it's a lost cause if we can't get it there by ourselves, which it obviously is not.

I couldn't tell if you were genuinely interested to hear more about it or whether you were just trying to plant seeds of doubt. From your response I'm presuming you only want to spread negativity."
2021-04-08 17:22:11,wallstreetbets,Que?
2021-04-08 10:48:40,wallstreetbets,"I'm a smooth brain and just googled it; you're right.

GTC orders are an alternative to day orders, which expire if unfilled at the end of the trading day. Despite the name, GTC orders do not typically remain active indefinitely. Most brokers set GTC orders to expire 30 to 90 days after investors place them to avoid a long-forgotten order suddenly being filled.

So it looks like setting the limit price near market pricing would be best."

2021-04-08 06:50:13,wallstreetbets,"Futures are higher this morning, with tech leading the charge. Nasdaq up about 0.9%, followed by the Russell 2000 (+0.7%). S&P 500 about 0.3% to the good. Dow futures are the only one with no gain so far. 

Weirdly, bonds are being bid up a bit as well. Ten-year Treasuries now yielding 1.65% and the 2-year is at 0.15%. That‚Äôs as of 0640.

This follows a pretty boring day where very little happened but the S&P still closed at another record high. Fed minutes showed no major debate on much of anything, with officials showing a unified stance on their ultra-loose policy.

Fed chair Powell is due to speak today at noon EDT. This is apparently part of a panel discussion at the IMF spring meetings, so it‚Äôs not like he will be taking questions. Wouldn‚Äôt expect much to come of that. Powell can stick to his stump speech on economic recovery and inflation and unemployment and be done with it. 

We also have initial jobless claims out at 0830 as we do every Thursday. 680k new claims are expected, which would be about 5% less than last week‚Äôs 720k number. If the number is too good then it will cue the inevitable talk about inflation and concerns about Fed tightening.

That‚Äôs all we got today. Don‚Äôt worry, next week earnings kick off and things should get more interesting."

If Hwang was 85% levered in January, and then left those positions alone, he would still be about 85% levered now - meaning that he would not have gotten any margin calls, his prime brokers wouldn‚Äôt have had to sell any stock, he‚Äôd still be worth many billions of dollars and his brokers would still be clipping fat fees without any losses."

You work at the drive thru for Mickey D's and found out that the burgers are made of human meat? Priced in. You think insiders don't already know that? The market is an all powerful, all encompassing being that knows the very inner workings of your subconscious before you were even born. Your very existence was priced in decades ago when the market was valuing Standard Oil's expected future earnings based on population growth that would lead to your birth, what age you would get a car, how many times you would drive your car every week, how many times you take the bus/train, etc. Anything you can think of has already been priced in, even the things you aren't thinking of. You have no original thoughts. Your consciousness is just an illusion, a product of the omniscent market. Free will is a myth. The market sees all, knows all and will be there from the beginning of time until the end of the universe (the market has already priced in the inevitable heat death of the universe).

2021-04-08 11:32:30,wallstreetbets,"My APHA story:

Going to repost my story here since many of you are feeling beat down and I already see comments encouraging you to leave your positions (I also hold Cresco so no bias from me):

Time in the market will always be better than timing it. I held onto APHA through the short report, bad press, not so great financials for years and pressure to sell. At the time I bought at the peak in 2017. 

Saw my shares go down to $2 and didn‚Äôt know what to do with myself. Family pressure and friends pressuring to sell. Saying that saving is the way and that I was being irresponsible. So I doubled down on every drop I could. 

By November my average share price was now 6.45 instead of 17 or 18 (can‚Äôt remember exactly). Elections roll around (exactly why I was BUYING MORE) and then we saw the results. 3 long years of me constantly looking at losses and feeling like complete shit because I had told people about my investments and of course people will always remind you of your mistakes every time they can (don‚Äôt do what I did be quiet). 

February rolls around and those same friends didn‚Äôt even ask. They knew. They knew I was right then and they know I am right today. There is no better feeling in the world and your day will come young grasshopper. You need to buy more. That‚Äôs it. Is it shares? Not options? Buy more. Is this industry going anywhere else but up? No. I‚Äôm still holding those shares and didn‚Äôt sell at the ‚Äútop‚Äù because that was t the top period. 

I am holding indefinitely because that‚Äôs how you build wealth. Not by hoping In and out of trades because somewhere along the way you‚Äôre gonna probably make a mistake. Few day traders are able to come up with (at peak) +300% return. The likelihood of you being able to do that? Not so likely. 

Hold your shares. Buy more. Period.

APHA April 16th 27C, April 23 19C and Jan 22 22C to the fucking moon!!! üöÄüöÄüöÄ

It‚Äôs okay to have beers and shoot. It‚Äôs okay to drink alcohol every day if you choose to. It‚Äôs ok to have employment with government agencies if you drink. You can serve in the military if you drink. You will have no problems with a security clearance if you drink.

None of the above is okay if you switch it to weed.

Things have to change and considering how Biden and Harris contributed to putting people in jail for a plant during their careers, their silence is unacceptable.

We sit here selfishly making money but what about the people that are locked up? The people that had their resumes tarnished forever? People of color and vulnerable people in general? When are we going to fight for them and raise our voices that this isn‚Äôt okay?

Are you fine with making money while knowing very well other people had their lives completely destroyed?

\- shareholders of APHA will receive 0.8381 of a share of TLRY at the merger (I wonder why Tilray's trading lower than Aphria right now? *edit: oh, my broker shows tilray in USD but aphria in CAD so it's confusing, they're trading at roughly .833 difference which is normal*)

\- the two companies combined will create the world's largest global cannabis company, with pro forma revenue of US$685m (C$874m) for the last 12 mo. prior to the Dec.16/20 merger announcement.

\- shareholders will vote on approvals for Tilray's charter amendment, share issuance, advisory compensation, and adjournment proposals to revise them;

\- increase the authorized capital stock of TLRY from 743,333,333 shares to 900,000,000 (890m class 2 common, 10m preferred)

It's a fairly valued stock at $4.  It's not going to double because of memes.  Even if it does, it'd revert back to trend within days.

1. Bullish whale wants to take a large position but the liquidity on the open market is so low that buying even 100k at a time would increase the price too fast and too much to work out so they are working out a block deal with another whale.

2. Bearish whale wants to close (or maybe reverse the position after seeing what happened with GME) and is working out a deal so they prevent a squeeze since the stock is visible on wsb. This reduces the likelihood of a squeeze but doesn't change the fact that ASO is a great company.

Would it be a decent idea to buy 100 shares (total cost roughly $17,500.00) use those to sell a LEAP call (Jan 20, 2023 150C) for $10,000.00 and use the $10,000 credit to buy 57 shares? You'd technically own 157 shares at an average cost of $111.46 and if your LEAP call gets exercised at any point you'd be left with 57 shares at an average cost of $43.86.

The threat of an AWB would massively drive gun sales, but it's not realistic. More likely IMO is Biden announcing more extensive background checks or waiting periods or licensing or something less drastic. These things won't cause appreciable increase in demand.

It's really only the threat of ""I won't be able to buy X after the ban"" that would cause a big increase in demand."

2021-04-08 07:33:19,wallstreetbets,"Most professionals are carefull critiquing others. However, reading between the lines she gets a fair bit of critiquing for her risk management. Not so much for investing in high risk, high reward companies - that is a deliberate strategy. More for the massive size of her positions. When she starts pulling out some of these companies will have the rug pulled from under their feet (so to speak). She has drawn a lot of interest and thus an influx of cash. I'm not saying it's going to go south, but should all those people who piled on the last 6 months start to question their decision and pull out due to flat or negative development lately, it might trigger a domino effect. That is one possible scenario anyways. I need to stay stressed all day every day so I'll buy in to it for the scare."

When investors are flooding toward you, not only can you not sell, you‚Äôre forced to buy. If this continues, she‚Äôll be forced to expand her holdings, which is probably why she amended her prospectus. 

It really comes down to if you believe that Cathie Woods is a better picker of tech stocks than you are. Performance wise, so far she‚Äôs been a rockstar. And time will tell. I‚Äôve got 2 buy writes on ARKK, because the premium is so good."

They‚Äôre already killing it in India, they own a service called HotStar which was just rebranded as Disney Plus. I think they have ad supported free service there and several paid tiers too. Heavily sports-based programming. This is all just still a small part of what they do as a company.

So yeah I can see 260 post-COVID given how ridiculously forward-looking this market is."

2021-04-08 06:43:28,wallstreetbets,"I assure you, this ISN'T going to get political. Because by all accounts America is screwed. My planned position is bottom paragraph.

Under the current pseudo-democratic government (oligarchic military industrial complex [Palantir to the moon üöÄüöÄüöÄ, btw]) there has been a general degeneration of all aspects of America. Due to systemic nepotism, there are geography teachers that don't know where the Middle East is, army officers that can't read, and cops that have never not fired a gun.

Their healthcare sector is a joke. America that it has some of the worst Healthcare outcomes in the OECD, A study by the Commonwealth fund showed the USA lags behind every modern western country despite paying x2-x3 times, they have the worst administrative eficiency, health outcomes, cost vs price and mortality rates. This is almost exclusively down to their Laisse-faire approach.

One the biggest issues on top of this facing the American economy, and their political system, is the gradual descent of the middle class into proletarian status. This process, which has been going on intermittently since the 1970s, has worsened considerably over the past five years, and threatens to turn this century into one marked by downward mobility. The practice of fictitious occupations in the services sector that make money but don't produce anything physical there is widespread enough that the hollowed-out economy would have driven itself into insolvency already if didn't have the advantages of the Plunge Protection Team. (Seriously go look up the Plunge Protection Team)

Estimates are that some 100% of government funds are misused in some way, ranging from government subsidies given to businesses owned by government officials in places like Ukraine as well as wherever a Trump hotel is to simply going missing from accounts. Yellen, disciple of the Great Benjie ""Big Buck$$$"" Bernanke solved this, against advise of wiser people, with quantitative easing (QE). Which is a fancy term for printing money, and since they could never possibly reverse that printer the true inflation rate (which like in SA is rigged by carefully choosing the composite basket that makes up ""inflation"") is the US is grossly underreported. Just look at house prices in Baltimore. Oh lord.

That is all besides how the largely defunct government doesn't prevent anything on the ground. Roaming bands of pirates (many affiliates of Antifa and QAnon) will poison guard dogs and torture and murder residents often for as little as waving some stupid flag. Many communities are functionally independent and take the law in their own hands (e.g. Castle Doctrine), and in many areas utilities are defunct (hell in some parts of America you can light your tap water on fire).

Then came the COVID-19 crisis. The misery inflicted by the virus across the United States and the government‚Äôs failed response has spread the idea of America‚Äôs decline even further among the general public globally.

I first thought about shorting America over a year ago when I was researching the country (I'm a historian, I read much on the country for fun). I found a really good index tracking America called the ""VOO"" (run by Vanguard thankfully and not those Robinhood c-slurs) which is a pretty accurate representation of American economy and buying puts on it is perfect so there was no need to do something as unbelievably stupid as short a currency you have to pay interest out the ass on. Make sure you use long-term LEAPs, don't buy those FDs.

This isn't a short term swing trade, I'm waiting for America to implode.

There is a clear pattern of behavior by China in recent years. They are doing this in many African countries, knowing that they will never be able to repay the debt.  This is beyond some mining companies exploiting workers.  China is taking over entire infrastructures with their loans.  Whole governments will be at their mercy when they default.

2021-04-08 10:31:50,wallstreetbets,"The first source is an opinion piece from a pro-US, nationalist publication. In addition a project being ""plagued with technical and financial issues"" is pretty standard for large scale, industrial projects. In the article itself the loan terms were extended. How is that any different than the EU and lending to countries like Greece?

Your second source is another opinion piece on what China wants. No critical analysis, just critiquing China's economic ambitions in Africa.

Your third source is another sensationalist website. In addition it says African countries have incurred debt, which is risky and that Covid makes them in risk of paying back some loans -- that is the state of most developing countries in the world, including those with loans backed by Western Institutions. Many countries are going to have to renegotiate debt because of how Covid wrecked their economies.

I could barely sift through that second source with the ads. Sorry. I have spent time in Africa. Look at Ethiopia, Kenya and other countries where China is ""debt trapping"" and the change in development is astounding. Believe it or not China has poured billions into Africa and has provided a signficiant amount of positive change for development. Is it perfect? No. Are there problems with corruption? Yes. Will there be some nations that end up like Argentina? Probably, but to act like China is just duping Africans and they aren't receiving any benefit in terms of infrastructure and economy is ridiculous. Your sources are also horrible: Newsweek, Forbes, National Interest or well known propaganda outlets for the US. Go to Africa where China has invested and see for yourself. Anyone that has spent time there in the past few decades can see the mostly positive that has been done.

Below are better sources. Anyone that froths at the mouth and says ""China investment in Africa bad"" has no clue with they are talking about, has spent no time at all in Africa, and has fallen victim to Western Propaganda. It would be like saying all American investment in countries is good, when we know that is bullshit. Overall, Chinese investment has brought profound, positive change.

I'm right and you're arguing past the point. The very best case scenario is that the boom creates more jobs for miners.

The article doesn't state that at all. It first says that there is ZERO or very little evidence it has wiped away debt for strategic control. That is paragraph four on page one. Read it again. Also the idea that any country or financial institutions doesn't engage in sovereign lending without any sort of generic strategic plan behind it is ridiculous. You are the one jumping to conclusions that any strategy is nefarious. The article clearly doesn't even state China is debt trapping, explains the challenges China faces with potential renegotiation and explains there is no evidence of these Chinese takeover yet you insist it is happening. Good grief. You took a sentence and said the complete opposite. Read the paragraph ""28 billion"" question again.

Also, look at [this](https://www.ship-technology.com/news/atco-acquire-40-stake-neltume-ports-340m/). Replace the company with a Chinese one and tell me what your thoughts would be. Stop falling for propaganda. Chinese investment is mixed. It is strategic, just like any investment made by a European or American company would be. Some good, some bad. It is so strange how the IMF lends money and restructures debt it is just business but when China lends and does it is a debt trap. Also, struggling to pay back a loan isn't limited to African countries. Open your eyes to the propaganda. Nothing is black and white.   

Honestly that is my huge gripe with people regarding China. You can literally go to small towns in Europe that were dead in the water until Chinese investment arrived yet you only hear the bad. Angola is one of those countries cited as being debt trapped (yes, Angola is super corrupt) but I remember just a few years ago Angola was being cited as going to be one of the first countries to have reverse colonialism with Portugal, as Angolans were buying up corporations in Portugal and snapping up properties. Now when oil revenue dries up all of a sudden they are being taken advantage of."

2021-04-08 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Rite Aid ( RAD ) Remains on Track Despite Projected Q4 EBITDA Miss **Rite Aid Remains on Track Despite Projected Q4 EBITDA Miss**

(by **The Sound of Money** as seen on **Seeking Alpha** on April 7, 2021)

***Management Updates Guidance***

On March 25, 2021, Rite Aid provided updated guidance for the 2021 fiscal year that closed on February 27, 2021. In that guidance, Rite Aid indicated the following:

¬∑ Full year revenue of approximately $24 billion (on target with guidance of $23.9 - $24.2 billion provided on December 17, 2020).

¬∑ Fully year net loss of $90 to $100 million (in line with guidance of $89 - $114 million provided back on December 17, 2020)

¬∑ Full year adjusted EBITDA of $425 - $435 million representing a miss of $65 - $85 million versus the December 17, 2020 guidance.

The adjusted EBITDA miss caused RAD shares to tank more than 20% and settle below $19 per share. But was that price reaction in the stock warranted?

***Deutsche Bank Raises Price Target on RAD***

The following day on March 25, 2021, despite the blow that had been dealt to RAD shares by the market, Deutsche Bank raised its price target on Rite Aid to $27 from $17 and added the stock to its ‚ÄúCatalyst Call Buy Idea‚Äù list. What could be behind this vastly divergent view held by Deutsche Bank compared to that of the general consensus on Wall Street?

***The Q4 COVID Effect***

The EBITDA hit taken by Rite Aid during Q4 of the company‚Äôs 2021 fiscal year was directly related to a unique, non-repeating event, namely the explosion in spread of COVID-19 infections that took place throughout that 90-day period. The spike in USA COVID-19 cases was centered directly in Rite Aid‚Äôs Q4 which ran during the months of December 2020 to February 2021. During Rite Aid‚Äôs fiscal 4th quarter, much of the nation was on lockdown mode. Visits to retail stores were less frequent, and acute prescriptions were down. Most devastating to Rite Aid‚Äôs profitability during the quarter was the fact that precautions taken to avoid COVID-19 spread, also dramatically reduced the incidence of common cold and flu.

Rite Aid‚Äôs 4th quarter EBITDA miss is a one-off, COVID-19 related event that is now in the rearview mirror. Looking ahead, there are significant tailwinds that should bolster the company‚Äôs financial performance in the 2022 fiscal year which began on February 28, 2021.

***The Re-Opening Trade***

In addition to the updated guidance provided by Rite Aid on March 25, 2021, the company gave some insight into the start of the new fiscal year (2022) that began on February 28, 2021:

*""Looking ahead, we have seen acute prescriptions return to positive levels in March‚Ä¶‚Äù* ‚Äì Heyward Donigan, CEO, Rite Aid

In the first quarter of the prior (2021) fiscal year, Rite Aid saw a year-over-year decline in acute prescriptions of 14.8% resulting from the postponement of outpatient medical visits and elective surgical procedures related to the coronavirus pandemic. The prior year decline in acute prescriptions contributed to a 2.6% decline in adjusted EBITDA during the first quarter of fiscal 2021. The decline in Rite Aid‚Äôs acute prescription sales continued throughout the first half of fiscal 2021, with a drop of 4.9% in that year‚Äôs second quarter. However, with the economy re-opening, outpatient visits and elective surgical procedures have now largely returned to normalized levels, as is indicated by Rite Aid‚Äôs report of a positive trend in acute prescriptions during the first month of the new fiscal year, 2022. As a result, Rite Aid should see a significant increase in year-over-year acute prescriptions which should contribute to an increase in adjusted EBITDA during the first half of the current fiscal year. As well, with the COVID-19 lockdown now concluded in the USA, it can be reasonably expected that visits to local drug stores will increase relative to the first half of the prior year, with a broader range of products being purchased by consumers beyond just cleaning products and disinfectants. As such, front-end retail store revenues will likely see a year-over-year boost, adding further to improved adjusted EBITDA results.

***Impact of Coronavirus Vaccinations***

Another significant contributor to Rite Aid‚Äôs improvement in first half fiscal 2022 results will be the coronavirus vaccine distribution program. Rite Aid is an official participant in the US government‚Äôs Federal Retail Pharmacy Program for COVID-19 Vaccination. Recently, the US government dramatically increased the reimbursement rates for pharmacies administering the coronavirus vaccine to $40 from $28 for a single dose. Within Rite Aid‚Äôs updated guidance announcement issued on March 25, 2021, Rite Aid CEO, Heyward Donigan remarked:

*‚Äú‚Ä¶we are proud to be selected as one of the retail providers administering COVID vaccines in the majority of our key states and cities, representing over 1,800 of our stores. We are significantly ramping up the number of vaccines we are administering on a daily basis, and have administered approximately 1 million COVID vaccines in March to date.‚Äù*

At the rate of vaccination indicated by this statement above, it is fair to estimate that Rite Aid will administer approximately six (6) million doses of COVID-19 vaccine during the first half of its 2022 fiscal year. Using the government reimbursement rates, the six (6) million doses will likely generate $230 million in revenue for Rite Aid and contribute approximately $2 per share in net profits. While the initial vaccination program will likely be completed during Rite Aid‚Äôs fiscal first half, the COVID-19 vaccine boosters are likely to become an annual revenue / profit stream for Rite Aid, as the annual flu vaccine is today. The latest view from epidemiologists suggests that annual coronavirus booster shots will likely be required on an annual basis. The global spread of coronavirus variants such as the E484K mutation lend credence to this view. Furthermore, customers visiting their local Rite Aid for COVID-19 vaccinations and boosters will become aware and take advantage of the fact that the retailer also offers nineteen (19) other vaccines, including flu, pneumonia, chicken pox, HPV, hepatitis A & B, and meningitis among others. As a result, vaccine distribution will continue to play a role in Rite Aids retail pharmacy growth story.

***Second Half of Fiscal 2022 Will See Benefits from Cold / Flu Season***

Rite Aid‚Äôs 2nd half of fiscal year 2021 saw earnings take a significant hit due to the weak cold and flu season during the coronavirus pandemic lockdown. However, experts are concerned that the upcoming cold and flu season could by dramatically worse. As face-to-face interaction between people returns as a result of the end of the lockdown, there will be far greater spread in the USA of virus that cause cold and flu. Also, as a result of last season‚Äôs reduced flu level, there exists little data for utilization in the development of the upcoming seasons flu shots. With little data available to scientists, the 2021 ‚Äì 2022 flu shots may not be highly effective at preventing the flu. On a relative basis, Rite Aid is likely to see much higher year-over-year revenue and profits in the second half of the fiscal 2022 (September 2021 through February 2022) related to cold and flu remedies.

***Long-Term Debt Remains a Downside Risk***

The long-term debt level remains a concern for Rite Aid. As of the Q3 earnings report, the company indicated that debt stood at $3.2 billion. The interest level required to service this debt amounts to approximately $200 million per year, which is a drag on earnings to the tune of approximately $3.65 per share. Thus far, Rite Aid has demonstrated that it is capable of servicing this debt level successfully, and it expected to report positive free cash flow for the full year fiscal 2021. However, if there is an unexpected downturn in the economy or Rite Aid‚Äôs performance, the long-term debt could put the company‚Äôs financial future in jeopardy.

***The Author‚Äôs Estimate of Rite Aid‚Äôs Fiscal 2022 Forward Guidance***

Based on the assumptions noted above, I have calculated an estimate of Rite Aid‚Äôs forward-looking guidance for the company‚Äôs fiscal year 2022. My figures for Rite Aid‚Äôs financial outlook for the current fiscal year are as follows:

**FISCAL YEAR 2022 PROJECTIONS (BASED ON THE AUTHOR'S ESTIMATES)**

**Total Revenues: $24.9B - $25.2B**

**Same Store Sales: 4.0% - 5.0%**

**Adjusted EBITDA: $590M - $620M**

**Net Gain: $6M - $31M**

**Adjusted net income per share: $2.45 - $2.85**

**Capital Expenditures: \~$225M**

**Free Cash Flow: $170M - $220M**

***Conclusion***

Rite Aid‚Äôs financial performance for fiscal year 2021 was negatively impacted by COVID-19, primarily due to a reduction in acute prescriptions and low sales of cold and flu treatments. During the current fiscal year (2022), the company is likely to see a strong revenue and profit improvement as it benefits from tailwinds created by normalized demand for acute prescriptions, cold and flu remedies, and the boost provided from reimbursements for COVID-19 vaccine administration. Vaccine administration is likely to benefit Rite Aid in the long-term, providing a growing revenue and profit stream for the company."

2021-04-08 01:59:31,wallstreetbets,"Great question.

CVS and Walgreens are both great companies.  If you are looking for a stable long-term growth story play in the pharmacy sector, I would recommend either of those over Rite Aid.  Drawback is, both WBA and CVS presently appear to be fully valued.

Consider that Walgreens has a market cap of nearly $50 billion and CVS's market cap is almost $100 billion.

Rite Aid on the other hand has a market cap barely above $1 billion.

So for those who want to take a conservative, safe approach and go for making 10 - 15% per year on their money, then either CVS or Walgreens would be a good play in the pharmacy arena.  Both WBA and CVS have far better earnings, financials and less risk compared to RAD.  

However, for investors who prefers to take the YOLO approach, then Rite Aid is a far more interesting option. With Rite Aid you have the possibility of doubling or tripling your money in a single year. And, since the market cap is so low, it is also an attractive buyout target for anyone looking to get instant market share in the USA pharmacy and PBM sectors. Finally, Rite Aid has only a mere 55 million shares outstanding (--that's 10 million less than GameStop GME has). With so few shares outstanding, if a retail investors began taking an interest in Rite Aid, the stock could instantly soar to something in the triple-digit price per share range."

2021-04-08 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"My non-technical SPY options scalping strategy 1. I try to keep my trading only to 10am EDT to 11am (I‚Äôve found that if I stay in much longer trades have a greater likelihood of turning against me).

2. I watch price action before I jump in to see where prices are bouncing around and identify a channel I can hop in to. I‚Äôll check the chart but for some reason my brain processes the actual numerals better so I like to keep an eye on SPY % changes and share price change. For example, if it is bouncing between 0.02% and 0.06%.

3. One a price channel is identified, depending on timing, I‚Äôll buy an in the money call or put for the closest expiry date. Based on my example, I would buy the call at 0.02% or the put at 0.06%. I‚Äôve nearly lost my ass on 0 DTEs so I prefer to have at least a day to recover if the trade moves against me, but holding overnight is really less than ideal for so many different reasons, theta decay being #1.

3. I buy to open in multiples of 10 contracts and depending on price action I‚Äôm looking to capture a .05 or .10 movement in my favor. Sometimes this happens within 10 seconds and sometimes it is a few minutes. I only trade one lot at a time and once I buy to open I will immediately input a limit sell because the price action can be so fast you cannot rely on reaction time alone to capture profits. Also, if I miss my entry because things are moving quickly, I will wait for entry or take the other side of the price channel, or wait to identify a new channel.

4. Manage risk appropriately. Size trades appropriate to preferred risk levels. If the price action gets away from the target, sometimes patience can see through to a profit; it‚Äôs a personal decision to know when it‚Äôs time to take an L and close out. Don‚Äôt be greedy or you‚Äôll get burned. 

This is not financial advice and this strategy can be stressful and requires full attention and fast decision making. Just my wack ass way of trading options, there is probably a better way ü§™"

2021-04-08 02:42:05,wallstreetbets,"Wouldn‚Äôt be the first time. Apparently the app is notorious for ‚Äúgoing down‚Äù at the worst times possible. A while ago I recall reading about one guy on this subreddit who had Nike calls that went up several times in value. When he tried to sell, the app kept spitting out errors. By the time it let him sell his contracts, they were almost worthless."
2021-04-08 06:08:22,wallstreetbets,"The last time they prevented buying was to help the hedge funds, not spite their customers. 

This time if they stopped people selling it would he to spite their customers because it would only hurt the hedge funds by restricting supply."

2021-04-08 17:06:58,wallstreetbets,30k? 1 million is the starting point to sell

2021-04-08 12:57:10,wallstreetbets,Fidelity or Vanguard.
2021-04-08 12:57:05,wallstreetbets,Anything but RH
2021-04-08 17:16:35,wallstreetbets,TDAmeritrade is pretty neat
2021-04-08 06:14:20,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs just hella risky bro if they decides to lock up the selling and buy of shares when it takes off all your purchased shares are useless until they allow you to sell or buy
2021-04-08 02:45:00,wallstreetbets,Fuck that and RH needs to be investigated.
2021-04-08 06:28:28,wallstreetbets,This is the way....no wait.
2021-04-08 17:19:15,wallstreetbets,"Sure why not.  Ultimately, the liability is gonna roll up the chain so theoretically they would have to settle at prices people set to settle/clear the transactions.  If all the rich assholes from 08 were able to settle garbage assets worth .01 at full face or more, why the fuck cant us ewoks get a taste of that?"
2021-04-08 04:01:58,wallstreetbets,"Well, fuck"
2021-04-08 06:29:55,wallstreetbets,Chase is the worst broker ever.  Ever!   Except BAC of course.

2021-04-08 08:39:10,wallstreetbets,There's 0% chance they'll block the ability to sell. The shorts want people to be able to sell - anyone who can't sell has hands that are literally made of diamonds and that will fuck them harder.
2021-04-08 06:15:40,wallstreetbets,Then I suppose I just hold them longer

2021-04-08 12:20:54,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm worried on them locking it up because they can‚Äôt afford it. It hit 300 last time and they couldn‚Äôt afford that so they manipulated it to bring it down. On top of that you don‚Äôt own the shares either. Too many red flags for me even to sit around and find out. We know with dd that the ‚Äúpossibility‚Äù is higher then 300 so I wouldn‚Äôt risk anything on that broker/wannabe broker app
2021-04-08 06:23:57,wallstreetbets,Are these guys lending your shares out to short tho? Do you even own those shares.

2021-04-08 08:29:31,wallstreetbets,Keeping something held over someone‚Äôs head until paid off whether it be time money blood or bodies is always going to be bad in my book. Plus the creation of debt is stupid. If two people lend $1 back and forth twice doesn‚Äôt create $1 of debt owed to each person it cancels it out as paid in my book. How creating debt off of an asset traded back and forth between two people when there is only 1 asset is just stupid in its creation.
2021-04-08 08:48:14,wallstreetbets,"Depends on if there is a catalyst that causes the shares to HAVE to be delivered = share recall, margin call, etc. In that case it doesn‚Äôt matter if shares are shorted, only that there are more shares in circulation than exist, i.e., synthetic shares, which one can argue only can come into existence from HFs naked shorting. Which, again, gets back to institutional ownership being >100%. 

So, draw your own conclusions..."

2021-04-08 01:57:56,wallstreetbets,"So tired of hearing multiple comparisons for between second tier companies and first tier companies.  If the profits are in decline, I don't care how many buybacks.  They do not have enough content to be tier 1, therefore they do not deserve a high multiple.  If they merged with Fox (for 21st century Fox and a counterpoint to CBS on news) or somebody else who could round out their content, it would be compelling.

Cord cutting is real, but this company is stuck in the dichotomy, I can't decide if by 2025 they will be pure resellers or have a legit platform that I want to make a monthly contribution to.  I think they need to consolidate or they fade.  Advertising will decline either way, and I see margin compression ahead.

A company that was previously buying stock doesn't issue equity unless they think that figure was overvalued.  They may start buying again at these levels, but I don't see 100+ in the next 12 months and would think they stop buying around 70-80.  They may do well this year as theatres reopen, but that might be their peak profit.

Disclaimer:  I sold puts on this during the crash and closed out for a small profit.  My thought process was that they were worth $30 months ago, and that they got bid up mostly on multiple expansion because they were starting to stream and succeed, but it wasn't overwhelming, so I did not go long."

We couldn‚Äôt afford very nice properties but we got what we could. Turns out you don‚Äôt build much equity over 9 years on 20-30 year term loans, even less when you finance the down payments with hard money. We broke even most months, only profit was the small equity payments we got from tenants monthly, most of our other revenue going to interest payments and repairs (like I said, properties were shitty). Despite not knowing much when we started, 9 years later we‚Äôve been able to cash out quite a bit of cash for not having much of our own money in (truth is we didn‚Äôt have money to put in when we started, we were kids). Between the tenant turnover, constant repairs and capex expenditures, we decided to cash out and enter the market. We are clearly comfortable with risk (100% financing on rentals). Whether you believe me or not doesn‚Äôt matter. Whether you understand my conviction for PLTR or not doesn‚Äôt matter. We‚Äôll find out in 5-10 years who was right regardless of what either of us believes.

If the property does those 2 things I‚Äôd argue it wasn‚Äôt a pos investment as all OP did was put down a down payment that they will eventually make back due to a positive cash flow or sale of an appreciated asset.

Also mentioned was west virginia university campus where I lived for years. Houses easily under 100k that had 5-6 rooms charging 500 a months. Hell the last house I lived in was a 2 bedroom that the owner paid like 40k for.

I think you guys hear investment property and picture marble countertops and inground pools. Investment property is anything that you charge a tenant.they were a dime a dozen in morgantown"

Edit: high migrant population from south america that work on the farms. They'll rent out 1000 sq ft ranchers and split rent between 2 families.

2nd edit now that It hit me even worse: when I was in college in west virginia there were houses going for 80k that had 5-6 rooms all charging 500 each. They didn't have top of the line interiors but people def can make bank off 100k ""investment "" prop if in right location .

How does this line of credit work? We just go to the bank. They do ask a downpayment nowadays of 10/20% of the purchase. Before corona you would loan 100%."
2021-04-08 06:23:46,wallstreetbets,Yeah I have. I played poker while studying at uni and paid everything myself. University costs like 1000 euro a year here so welcome to Europe.
2021-04-08 01:53:00,wallstreetbets,No not illegal. They have green cards. Not everybody wants to own. They are not full u.s citizens and have time constraints.  The assumption that it is illegal is ignorant af tbh.
2021-04-08 06:01:03,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I think many of the people here are american and don't realize that our system of credit based loans isn't common around the world. In the US you have a credit score that's supposed to basically be a record of you financial history and give possible lenders an idea of how likely you are to repay. A sizable amount of people in the US don't meet the criteria for receiving an institutional loan based on the fact that their credit score isn't considered good enough. This may be because they don't have a long enough history of having received and replayed loans in the past, or because they've had some issues with meeting loan obligations in the past, or  other factors. So because they can't get a loan to purchase a house they have no other option but to rent and essentially pay someone else's mortgage at 1200 a month because they themselves couldn't procure a loan. It's the main reason mom has never owned a home and the percentage of americans stuck in this situation trends up every year as american take on more non home equity associated debts."
2021-04-08 06:27:31,wallstreetbets,Hahahaha Ok nevermind. I just realized how much of a waste of time going further into this conversation would be for me. Good Luck!

2021-04-08 01:59:13,wallstreetbets,"""not everybody wants to own"" --> some people just want to throw their money away you say? It makes 0 sense if the difference is that big. 

it's ridiculous to have such a high yield on properties. Here we are looking at around 3.5/4% ROI on renting properties. My apartment costs 350k euros and I'd rent it out for 900 a month. You can't afford my place for instance with the rent you pay so people try to rent & save some money."
2021-04-08 06:07:08,wallstreetbets,"That's sickening.... We even provide an option to people too poor for a regular bank loan to get a government approved loan with a very low rate. Some requirements. No property in possession, low income, must reside there min 5 years."
2021-04-08 09:33:01,wallstreetbets,Yeah but that's the USA and apparently worthy of getting down voted for saying it's cheap in Europe especially Belgium. I get taxed almost 60% though on everything I own but whatever.
2021-04-08 02:03:06,wallstreetbets,"Do you not comprehend ? There are people that can ONLY stay In the country for a few years. Why in the world would they buy a house if they can't live in it in 4 years. 

Im honestly confused if your purposely being a idiot. Like are you a bot that is refusing to understand the logic. Would you buy a house that you can't live in when you are forced to leave a country you agreed you can live in for a few years to work?"
2021-04-08 02:05:35,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm unsure why you are still bothering with this guy. u/curvejjeje is showing severe signs of retardation
2021-04-08 02:13:37,wallstreetbets,"Still explain it to me. I'm serious. I'm in real estate and we construct roughly 70/80 apartments a year and sell them. 

Here in Belgium you'll be taxed on the profit you'll make on selling a property within 5 years, but it's just 16.5% on the profit you make on top of the purchase. Longer than 5 years and not taxed. 

The thing is you pay of intrest and capital in stead of paying the mortgage of a home owner so it's still more beneficial to purchase and sell within the 4 years you mentioned.

So yeah I'm super curious why people don't purchase. Are housing prices that volatile that they drop as well just as much as they rise?"
2021-04-08 02:10:57,wallstreetbets,Facts. I just re-read his last comment and he mentioned me not being to afford his apt. Like nowhere in this thread did I mention me paying anything for rent. Im legit confused
2021-04-08 02:14:47,wallstreetbets,I don't understand why not everybody goes after a 11% ROI on real estate?
2021-04-08 02:16:55,wallstreetbets,"Well I hope you don't make any major decisions besides what postage to use because you are seriously slow. 

If I was given a work permit in belgium for 2 years and then had to return to U.S. 

Why in the fuck would I buy a house"
2021-04-08 02:14:03,wallstreetbets,"Talking about the ""south Americans"""
2021-04-08 02:23:31,wallstreetbets,Poor / temporarily employed people exist my dude. A lot of individuals in the world don‚Äôt have the means to afford their own home let alone a home with ROI. Renting is their only option.
2021-04-08 02:23:47,wallstreetbets,"Again because it would make you money in stead of costing you money (unless the company pays your rent but let's not go that way).

I have a lot of expats as clients and they all purchase properties and sell them with profit gains tax of 16.5%, because housing prices rise here around Brussels around 5% a year.

You rent a property for 2 years: It costs you around 2.000 euros for a decent property around Brussels so 2 years it's a net loss of 48.000 euros. 

You purchase a property of 500k euros and will resell it for the same price. You have paid 6% registration fees which is 30k euros. 

Net you win 18k euros. IF you make MONEY (prices rise roughly 5% a year here) you deduct profit with a 16.5% tax. 

Houses sell here within a week without issue and Belgium has one of the most stable housing markets of Europe. We had Ernst&Young do an investigation on our housing market for a project we realised of 115 apartments in Brussels (+- 36M project).

To continue again on your argument that people are ok paying 1200 dollar a month for a 120k property. I'd just keep buying properties and getting money from the banks based on my renting contracts."
2021-04-08 03:49:20,wallstreetbets,But explain me the US tax system because buying is cheaper than renting with those prices???
2021-04-08 02:28:07,wallstreetbets,I feel bad for your significant other bc there is seriously no ability for you to understand anything than your own righteous mind
2021-04-08 02:25:24,wallstreetbets,Look how long your explanation was. Did it ever occur to you people like simple lives? I didn't even read your entire statement the same way these renters want to just RENT a property and be done with it when they leave the area. You're seriously dense
2021-04-08 03:50:10,wallstreetbets,Why make it personal? I'm genuinely curious because if housing is so cheap and people can afford to pay 1200 a month for rent they can buy 2 of those houses.
2021-04-08 03:48:56,wallstreetbets,I have to explain myself because apparently you guys can only comment on my person in stead of explaining why it's more interesting to loan in stead of buying when it's so much cheaper!

2021-04-07 23:06:10,wallstreetbets,"I've done so much DD on these guy like many months of consistently learning about them. Takes way too long to explain but basically their software is everything. They are miles ahead of every other company that wants to do what they do. The total addressable market for what they do is going to absolutely balloon and already is in terms of demand. The airforce basically just gave them a contract without even taking proposals because there's literally no one else who can even bid because PLTR is so much further ahead. They sued the army and won for an almost billion dollar contract that basically insured they will have reaches into every possible military budget. They're already getting into every commercial space that exists as well. Plus health care.. they're stopping crime catching terrorists fighting china caught bin laden transitioning companies to the cloud helping oil companies go green. I mean I could list for ever. The application of their software is endless. They don't have any limits to which industry they can get contracts for. The way we fight wars in the future is basically going to be integrated completely with them. AI battles and Data intelligence augmentation is going to be integral to everything in the military. Oh they also are partnered with and invested in an electric ""air taxi company"" that will revolutionize travel and commuting. They also did the same thing with a company that is leading the industry for robot exoskeletons that the military and industries use to enhance the capabilities of workers. 

Their risks of their ability to scale is greatly overstated particularly because of their amazing leadership. 

The stock is only down recently because of lock up period expiring and all around market pressure. The lock up selling is a short term burst of selling that is and will equalize and then with the general market performing well it will ride along and bounce as they announce more contracts. Yeah people like Thiel and others sold significant shares but that's because this has been a 20 year venture for most of them. They're getting returns that they've worked for decades for. Insider selling isn't de facto a sign that anything is wrong with a company. In the right context yes obviously it's bad but here it's just them finally getting paydays after decades of work. 

They were basically created by the CIA just like Google was. That's why they have the most insane tech. 

https://www.google.com/amp/s/seekingalpha.com/amp/article/4414059-palantir-rising-war-in-garden-of-google

They have whale interest like Cathy Wood, Sequoia and plenty of others. 

Maybe I'll make a giant post where I dump stuff I've found on them over the last 5 months but honestly it's so easy to find. I could go on forever so maybe it's easier if I answer specific questions"

2021-04-07 23:39:53,wallstreetbets,"Google was just one of a series of projects, often classified, that were backed by the NSA and DARPA in the 1990s. As PhD students at Stanford, the work of Google‚Äôs founders was¬†overseen by two DoD officials and received funding from DARPA indirectly through a federal initiative.
Projects internally pursued by DARPA were consolidated into the¬†Information Awareness Office¬†in 2002. One such project, the¬†Total Information Awareness Program, planned to use predictive modeling and data mining to spot terrorists. Google uses similar techniques to identify consumers interested in a particular product. These were very new ideas at the time. The IAO was later defunded over fears that it was too Orwellian and could lead to mass surveillance of US citizens,¬†transferring parts of TIA to the NSA.

The DoD‚Äôs early involvement with Google isn‚Äôt necessarily surprising or nefarious. The internet itself has its roots in a DARPA project known as¬†ARPANET. The projects pursued by the Total Information Awareness Program were just the latest and most sophisticated in a long history of surveillance programs such as¬†FAIRVIEW. In the mid 1990s, the infrastructure behind a mass surveillance and data sharing program known as¬†UKUSA was bigger than the internet itself.

In reality the program scanned all books, hoping that the sheer scale and audacity would enable the company to stand on a weak ‚Äúfair use‚Äù loophole in the copyright law, taking advantage of the fact that few would understand that the true intention of the project was to create AI products that could later be commercialized."

2021-04-08 08:43:19,wallstreetbets,"See and therein lies the problem.

YES, it should, that's the way the system is setup for some reason, but they won't let the whole thing collapse. Some sort of eminent domain seizure of GME or whatever. It'll be unprecedented but it won't be complete collapse."

They're offering and bidding at the same time making markets all over the place. You literally can't fuck them unless you build out your own trillion dollar fiber line and hire the best financial programmers (that are already working for citadel). They literally don't care which way any asset moves. The fact that anyone trades it at all is putting money in their pockets. This whole narrative is such a joke its pathetic.
2021-04-08 00:26:14,wallstreetbets,"That‚Äôs not going to happen.

2021-04-07 23:50:52,wallstreetbets,"Theoretically possible, GameStop filed something allowing them to sell up to $1 billion worth of shares anytime in the next while. Meaning they‚Äôll be able to sell a few shares during the squeeze for a nice profit. Won‚Äôt matter much, even at current prices that‚Äôs only 5.5 million shares. Very little compared to the steaming load of shorts they‚Äôre sitting on. GameStop is also in a ridiculously strong position right now, they have no reason to let the shorts off the hook"
2021-04-07 23:58:25,wallstreetbets,that would still be costly for HFs unless GME sell it at a huge discount. Now why the fuck would GME do that?
2021-04-08 00:52:07,wallstreetbets,"Unecessary. The same share can be shorted multiple times.

No one can reasonably set a price target, all I can say Is probably the best strategy for most people is probably don‚Äôt sell all your shares at once, and maybe try and wait for after it peaks and buy in the way down. The suggestion here is since u don‚Äôt know the peak, if you buy after it moons you can probably get in under it close rather then selling on the way up and potentially missing the peak by a lot."
2021-04-08 01:27:25,wallstreetbets,"Impossible to say. It might have already peaked in January. It might peak over $1k/share. Pick a number you'd be mad that you didn't sell at and sell most of your shares at that number. Keep the rest for a second ""What if..."" number and sell the rest there."

2021-04-08 02:21:31,wallstreetbets,"I recommend watching some of warden Elites Videos where he discusses that among other things.

Here is my approch:

From what we know so far, we can predict it will be a bit of a ""move up in about the same way it did from 3$ to 100+$ - then settle a bit - then move up, trade sideways, settle a bit, move up.

As long as you sell only after (100.000+) and only on the downwards slopes and never everything, you should be fine. Look we will all take a share out when it hits 100.000+ I assume, but before that is the real test. You can't paperhand it in the green, especially NEVER before 6 digits.

They can not currently sell 5.5 million shares."
2021-04-07 23:54:00,wallstreetbets,"> Meaning they‚Äôll be able to sell a few shares during the squeeze for a nice profit.

You're saying that GME itself is an ape as well?"
2021-04-08 15:13:01,wallstreetbets,AAA+ information provided. Thanks for the answer!
2021-04-08 00:59:48,wallstreetbets,"GME doesn't make any money off their stock -unless- they sell shares.  Their most recent filing has them declaring that they wish to sell up to $1B worth or 3.5M shares, stopping at whichever limit that they hit first.

Not saying that they will, but if working out a deal would get them their $1B target with plenty of shares to spare, then it would be a reasonable path to take as a business.  To get their $1B, the average stock price would have to be just over $285 for all 3.5M shares. Whether they will do a off-market deal or not depends on how quickly they want/need that $1B for their business plans, since waiting for a squeeze (or -the- squeeze) to get that price on the open market may not be ideal for bankrolling time-sensitive business moves, especially since Cohen is clearly doing a top-to-bottom transformation of the company.  That said, they didn't act on their earlier filings for less money on more shares, so it's possible that a sale isn't urgent at all, and they are just keeping their options open in case it moons, so they can score a quick $1B alongside everyone else holding."
2021-04-08 15:44:17,wallstreetbets,Less costly for HFs than paying $420.69+/share to buy from apes. Seems like GME could potentially gain access to copious amounts of low interest financing through lending agreement(s) with HFs that are willing to correct/reverse their short positions.

2021-04-08 02:08:54,wallstreetbets,"If you have a 401k through Fidelity it takes maybe less than two days to get your brokeragelink set up, money taken out of your checking account and purchasing stock. 

The reason I say Fidelity is because A. I use them and B. they are one of the better companies you can deal with. 

With Fidelity, I forget which others are also good, you actually own your share if you buy with your cash money. I used to be on robinhood but they never actually but your share, they give you an IOU then go find a share if you want to sell it. It leads to shady stuff like them getting margin called in January shorting out that buildup. 

So get on fidelity, or schwab (I think) and only throw in what you can afford to lose. I have been in for two or three months, you can't put in money you need next week, next month or even later this year. 

This is how I approached it and I was down at the worst to -90%, had I sold because I needed just a little of that money I'd have sold and incurred actual losses. I am now sitting right about break-even."

2021-04-08 10:16:37,wallstreetbets,"Several hedgefund companies decided GameStop wasn‚Äôt worthy of existing anymore, so they purposefully started sabotaging its stocks to drive it out of business using illegal but ignored tactics. The people of WSB noticed this and, being Redditors, decided it‚Äôd be a good lol to save GameStop and started buying stock, to which the hedge funds replied by pulling More illegal tactics, directly attacking WSB in the process and starting the great GME war, at which point the members of WSB decided it was time for a revolution. So they started not just buying, but buying All GME stock, and the important part, Holding, in order to force the value to rise. It continued to escalate to the point that at least one app for trading shares banned GME stock from being purchased, and only allowed it to be sold. It continues to escalate to this day with the WSB redditors holding firm with their diamond hands, aiming for the moon while waiting for the short to occur. It is both a meme, and a goal. The goal varies from person to person. Some want to see a revolution that puts the money back in the hands of the every day people and a return to what stocks trading Should be, some are simply here for their own personal gain. There is no wrong reason to hold. I do not know much about stocks, trading and laws surrounding it so unfortunately I can‚Äôt get into exactly what laws were broken or how exactly any of this works. My basic understanding is that all stocks must be rebought by the hedgefund companies eventually, and the longer they wait the higher it goes. I hope this was sufficient!"

America's entire shtick is ""the free market."" What happens when everyone finds out its not free? Worse, its rigged in favor of the 1%. There will be riots. It will be catastrophic. But the cherry on top will be millions of companies refusing to do business in US markets because they are rigged. The US would lose trillions of dollars, and with no one investing in the stock market, the country would go tits up overnight. China and other countries would immediately start courting companies:

""The US markets are rigged. Do business in our country and we will treat you better."" 

I cannot adequately express how fucked this Nation will be if this doesn't go as smoothly as possible. By fucking us, they are fucking themselves 100x worse.

How much is it worth? Well... you NEED my banana, you HAVE to have it, actually, the system is going to liquidate everything you own to buy back the banana, so basically... what ever I decide it worth. $1000 a banana? $10,000? $1 Million? Liquidation doesn't care. Its buying every single banana it can. It WILL balance the books, it doesn't care what or WHO it has to liquidate to do so. Snake runs out of money? Well the snake who loaned banana to Snake? They have to buy the banana. The system starts to liquidate if they don't.

2021-04-08 10:44:56,wallstreetbets,"This will suffice. Thank you. 

And to clarify the last part, when HFs short a stock, they ""borrow"" shares from a lender, sell them, drive the price down via malicious means, repurchase the shares they sold for a lower price, then repay the lender who they borrowed the shares from. This is putting it in extremely simple terms. 

At the end of January, GME was over 100% shorted. HFs were screwed over because they had to re-purchase the borrowed shares they sold for $5-10 for $300+. They lost huge amounts of money. I'm not sure what current short interest of GME is, but I hope it's still decently high. :) 

I know nothing. I'm an ape who flings my feces at Ken Griffin."

2021-04-08 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"BABA $350 share - Charlie Munger just bought shares! It caught my eye that Charlie Munger (long-time partner to Warren Buffet) just bought BABA. Buffet and Munger had avoided technology for most of their careers before they hit a home run with AAPL. Its unusual to see these old guys buying into tech stocks, so I dug in and did a quick sum-of-the-parts analysis. Here is what I came up with, would love to get any feedback in case I am missing something.

* Core China eCommerce biz has 60% of all eCommerce in China. This is a highly profitable cash cow - approx. $250/share using a 25x P/E.
* Other China retail including leading grocery co Hema and stake in HK-listed Alibaba Health ‚Äì approx. $20/sh
* Net Cash - approx. $20/share
* Stake in Ant Financial at ¬Ω the valuation prior to canceled IPO  - approx. $20/share
* AliCloud ‚Äì leading cloud company akin to the AWS of China - approx. $20/share
* All others ‚Äì Eleme (Meituan competitor), Lazada (leading SE Asia eComm co), Cainiao logistics, Alibaba.com wholesale biz, Yoku online video, etc. - $20+/share
* Add all this up and total value/share is approx. $350/sh.
* Stock closed at $225, so \~65% of sum-of-the-parts, or in other words, we have 55% upside.

Alibaba appears to have a collection of growing/compounding businesses, so not only do you get short-term appreciation to sum-of-the-parts, but also good growth of the sum-of-the-parts. This can easily become a 200-300% return in \~2 years or less."
2021-04-07 21:10:44,wallstreetbets,BABA = Amazon of China. Biggest risk is pressure from Chinese govt keeping them smaller. Also risk in buying Chinese owned companies... you‚Äôre not buying the actual company stock I‚Äôm told. Otherwise I like it and own BABA.
2021-04-07 21:59:29,wallstreetbets,"Good news. I bought in January and watched it slide down 20% or so. Recently tripled my position as there‚Äôs no reason this stock shouldn‚Äôt get back above 300 this year in my opinion. For all the tension between the chicom party and Alibaba, the company is a global brand at this point and the CCP loves that in the long run. Their numbers are crazy good.

As long as Jim Cramer doesn‚Äôt tell people to buy it my confidence is even higher now."
2021-04-07 21:27:42,wallstreetbets,Interesting only a month after his mate Gates sold out of it.
2021-04-07 23:00:07,wallstreetbets,"Ali baba is dirt cheap. You‚Äôll never see these prices again. This is a gift.

Why is the stock down? Pressure from the Chinese government and threat of the us delisting them. How likely is either scenario? Very unlikely. The big tech companies in the us has faced regulation/anti-monopoly pressure from our government in the past and nothing ever happened. China will not destroy its most successful company. Ali baba will not be delisted.

The fundamentals for this company are off the charts."

Some are lucky some aren't as much. I don't gamble with politics, too sleazy even compared to WS shenanigans we're all used to."
2021-04-07 23:45:52,wallstreetbets,This is all assuming that the Chinese government doesn't nationalize it or trustbust it

It effectively comes out to the same thing on a returns basis but you don‚Äôt own BABA itself / obtain voting rights. Chinese companies all use this structure because of government-imposed ownership regulations.

2021-04-07 22:06:58,wallstreetbets,"If this were to happen, shares would move to HKSE.  Not the end of the world, but the price would probably take a hit. Then you could also argue that China has a vested interest to not letting the move happen, and if it does happen, to not let the stock tank. To me, not a reason to avoid investing a small portion"

Because idiots like this buy them. I mean if he bought at the absolute peak, he basically bet nearly 10% of the stock price that it would go up 50%.

2021-04-08 14:42:23,wallstreetbets,Ok I never understood the point of options/buying otm calls. I understand the basics but what is OP and frankly anyone buying OTM calls trying to accomplish?  How does buying these contracts benefit you more so then buying the shares initially (assuming the price happens to go past the break even point)? Wouldn‚Äôt it be better and much safer to just buy the shares now if you think the price will skyrocket so you get the shares at an even cheaper price? I don‚Äôt see the reward factor only the risk.

2021-04-08 15:00:25,wallstreetbets,Options basically Grant you leverage. Say your able to buy 100 shares you could have say 500 shares of exposure with options. Higher reward but also more risk
2021-04-08 19:37:32,wallstreetbets,"Each contract is 100 shares, so every $1 in price movement is potentially close to $100 in profit. You can make a lot more money more quickly than with owning shares.  But you can also lose everything very quickly."

It isn't like Biden announced the gov was buying a fleet of Teslas. Buying anything EV while waiting on Biden to discuss renewables was a no-brainer. The price went up $500 inside of 2 months and you're worried about $100.
2021-04-08 14:34:33,wallstreetbets,"Which price spike are you talking about?

I ask what date you're being surprised by because Biden's campaign ran specifically on this promise. Biden announced the EV fleet specifically it last year in November when he got elected. His administration also announced it again when inaugurated in January. There was another announcement recently.

So which one surprised you?

If you are sincere about our trade moves, I'll provide my example: I'd been in Tesla since the split at a cost basis of around $350. I sold at around $900 shortly after that inauguration-time announcement. This was all in my Roth and I moved that $15k or so into GME (which I already had other call options in) at a cost basis of around $56 for that particular account. The rest is history.

Point being...  plenty of people here were in clean energy and energy stocks long before last week. I think you're trying too hard to be surprised by the government's EV moves here dude. We can't trade for you."

And it is undoubtedly a better vax than JJ. Yet we continue to wait for nvax. In fact uk trials are already done on an usa vacxine because of this delay
This has nothing to do with mrna.
Mrna is a better vaccine than JJ too. Id be even more livid if that was given orchestrated hiccups too.

2021-04-08 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"SPCE üöÄ to the üåù (maybe) What‚Äôs up, been a lurker on this subreddit for a while- even used to have a flair back in the day, but this is my first DD - this is not financial advice I have one too many chromosomes for that.

SPCE has announced they will be launching their next test flight in may 2021. Historically SPCE has rallied before test flights, and then plummeted back to earth faster than their shitty failed launches. The stock price has taken a beating recently, as with many other growth stocks, it is down 50% since Feb 11th.

I believe this presents a tasty opportunity, and I think it is probable the stock will rally in a similar manner as it has done in the past when a test date is announced. 

The play here is to buy calls for either May if you are feeling brave, or June if you want a degree of freedom with dates.  You can hold the calls through the test flight if you want to risk it for the biscuit, but the safer play is probably to sell before the test as SPCE have been fucking up their test flights.

There is a part of me that believes that this next launch is crucial for the success of SPCE as a company, and that they will be highly unwilling to allow another failed test. Therefore, I am inclined to believe the test will be a positive result- but that is more of my personal feeling not based on facts and could be a prime example of gamblers fallacy. If the launch is successful then calls could print bigly.

Bear Case: SPCE already up 91% YTD and is a growth stock which can get fucked harder then your mother by a sector rotation to value. Also, there may be low confidence in SPCE as investors are tired of failed launches, this may limit the pre test runup. Also, there has been no firm date set for the launch- if there are continued problems then the options may expire before the rally. Finally, for those of you who eat crayons, the 1YR chart does somewhat represent a head and shoulders pattern, if SPCE falls below $26 there could be problems- personally I think technical analysis has about as much merit as palm readings and I‚Äôm not too concerned about this.

Positions: 30 X JUN 18 $34 calls - will likely sell half in the run up and hold out half in the hopes the launch will be successful.

If anyone has advice on why this is a bad play, please let me know - I‚Äôm here to make money not conformation bias"
2021-04-08 09:53:41,wallstreetbets,"for anyone that saw my regression analysis from the other week, we are literally watching the ticker defend the previous low of \~28.80.

2021-04-08 05:59:02,wallstreetbets,"My opinion, based on nothing more than observation: 

SPCE rode the same wave up that everybody else did last year. And took the same ride down. It‚Äôs highly speculative, and pretty much the same risk as any other growth/tech stock. If that sector takes another hit, SPCE will go down with it, and likewise go higher if there‚Äôs confidence in the market as a whole. 

What they‚Äôre not doing is turning a profit. Nor do they plan to, right away. They‚Äôre burning through money with R&D right now. Once they have a viable and repeatable way to get to orbit and back, that‚Äôs when they‚Äôll blast off (yuk yuk).

2021-04-08 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"The Market is Near Fucked at This Point There are a few outliers that have particularly showed up today that causes me some concern.

1.	‚Å†We had a slew of great data on the economic front. Record high job momentum. Possibly new spending on infrastructure. A populous looking to spend money. All of this is a positive but the market tanked over the last two days. The 10-year yields haven‚Äôt moved either which is definitely worrying. You should be very worried that they haven‚Äôt moved. What this is saying is that in lieu of rates not moving, the market has already priced in the economic boom. So there isn‚Äôt much upside left.
2.	‚Å†Main Street boom will happen without a hitch. The market went up last year because it factored that in. If you remember 2020, people lost jobs and government fiscal and monetary policy alleviated what COULD have happened in 2021, 2022, and 2023. It was not for only 2020.
3.	‚Å†QE was start tightening much more rapidly than you expect. A stronger stranglehold over the Fed‚Äôs purse means the cost of borrowing goes up and business expansion slows down, leading to shrinking margins for high growth stocks that have already been projected. This means that companies will not hit their estimate earnings and reduce their stock price.

The market is frothy. You all had a good ride, but there is more downward pressure on stock performance at this point. The economy will boom. We will see a mouthwatering GDP growth. But consider that the stock market is overweight on high growth tech and other bubbles. When it sells, it‚Äôll ruin the whole bunch. This impending collapse will only correct stocks while Main Street will have their time in the Sum.

Edit: CORRECTION- The market did not tank over the last two days. However, intraday trading is hovering around ATH for the past two days with a booming economy looming on the horizon. If it hasn‚Äôt moved up since then, it‚Äôs deciding where to go. Usually ATH either go up steadily with lots of volatility or it crashes."

2021-04-07 23:24:47,wallstreetbets,Commodities and metals might be a good play until things cool down.  Then you can buy the bottom and soar to new heights at the casino.  I‚Äôm heavy in weed stocks that I don‚Äôt want to sell as they have lost so much.  But I want to have funds free to yolo when the time comes.  Does anyone think these will ever go up?

Im hoping the ego of america actually benefits for once. Idk if we will but i agree with biden and many analysts that if we dont invest in US china will pass us by. 

So i dont necessarily believe in my heart it will go the right places but id rather spread positivity than negativity and there is a greater chance in my mind now than there was 6 years ago that we can sucessfully invest in us and change some policies regarding prison reform and education."

This is a good company. It has a Dr. Karp as their incredibly dedicated CEO. It has the very shrewd Mr. Thiel as chairman. It has a fantastic product.  They have a vision which they adhere to.  They have extremely talented programmers and developers and engineers. They are working in a field which will soon change the way data is analyzed and how the world uses that analysis. PLTR will likely be involved in something historically important,  technologically and geopolitically. 

I'll be referring to this comment someday in the future. Maybe a year or 10 years down the road. But those who ignore the opportunity of buying a company this promising are going to regret it later. Miss Cathie knows what she's doing."

2021-04-07 22:09:03,wallstreetbets,This is the way! Auntie just added 1m shares today too

2021-04-07 23:33:59,wallstreetbets,This was way worse when it was at 21

28 is more than 23. This is really basic stuff man come on."
2021-04-07 20:53:06,wallstreetbets,What made you go all in PLTR?
2021-04-08 08:11:12,wallstreetbets,That sounds stupid ngl

2021-04-08 00:35:43,wallstreetbets,Don't even get me started about being lazy. I can barely muster the moxie to type this comment. I'm waiting until PLTR hits $15-20 before buying any more.

2021-04-07 21:01:23,wallstreetbets,"A couple reasons:

1. I went to Stanford and saw a lot of the smartest young software engineers struggle to get offers from Palantir (even compared to FB and Google), Palantir was more exclusive and prestigious in the CS realm. Takeaway: Elite talent...they are good at software.
2. I‚Äôm a government contractor in engineering. I see firsthand that once a company has a contract, it takes a lot to lose it. So, I can see Palantir keeping/extending close to all government contracts they already have.
3. They are trusted by the most exclusive government agencies (speaks to their talent and ability to produce amazing products). 
4. They are just getting started on the commercial side and are able to build off of the software they have already developed for the government (not starting from scratch).
5. Data. We‚Äôre only getting more everyday.
6. It‚Äôs software, so margins are much better (they don‚Äôt have to buy expensive materials and aren‚Äôt subject to fluctuations in commodity prices)"

2021-04-07 23:04:58,wallstreetbets,"my biggest regret with PLTR was pissing away 10k on calls when i could have just bought more shares. 

Oh and buying NNDM, SURF, BNGO and TSLA at what I thought was a great deal.

They do not care if you lie on the app. The ONLY reason for the app is to cover their ass when you lose all of your money on options and you try to sue them. When you argue they were irresponsible in giving you the ability to trade highly risky things they pull out your app and say ""oh really, it says here you have a net worth of 25 billion dollars, 37 years of options experience at the age of 23, and made 3 million trades per year for the past 30 years"""

only no margin on some meme stocks. Fidelity is the better of the two, as they don't sell order flow and they didn't restrict trading in january. i don't use them anymore cause i got blocked after a failed deposit (my own fault), so i'm stuck w TDA for the time being."

Selling puts is the opposite: if the price is below a certain price on expiration, then I can BUY 100 shares. So a situation could be:

Sell 200 CC and collect 60k in premium. Then, turnaround and sell $20 cash secured puts expiring this week. If it drops to $18 and expires, then I buy 100 shares at $18. If not, I keep the premium on the puts."

Plus, primary mortgage origination is where the real money is and I think a lot of people will be eager to sell their homes at a premium with this housing shortage. I‚Äôm long both RKT and UWMC."

2021-04-08 00:09:35,wallstreetbets,"They don‚Äôt *try* to hold mortgages. They sell these mortgages to mortgage investors to ensure that their liquidity stays in place.

A couple things.

1. If interest rates were to rise again, RKT will be stuck with whatever mortgages they have OR they will have to take a haircut on each mortgage they sell to get someone to buy the mortgage.  If mortgage fair value is 100k, interest rate goes up, the 100k fair value now decreases. This is due to new mortgages having higher interest rate which means higher yields for prospective investors which makes RKT loans less attractive.

2. RKT goes from 13.2B to 22.8B in mortgage loans at fair value. The cash of rkt only increases 580M.  This means they are extremely leveraged which setups a situation where liquidity can dry up incredibly fast. 

3. 4% of clients have entered forbearance plan as of 12/31/2020. 4% of clients are delinquent. Rkt sold these 91B in loans to other institutions. But they were able to originate additional loans to offset the 91B sale. 

Tying it together.

We have an over leveraged company, that is using the fall of interest rates to boost up the number of loans they originate. Currently sit at 4% delinquent rate or 91B in loans that could be detrimental to the firm if they at any point can‚Äôt move these off the books. If interest rates rise, those loans become incredibly difficult to move. As well if they can‚Äôt move loans off their books a huge liquidity issue will exist which is necessary to write more loans. If the mortgage fair value depreciates,  assets < liabilities = not good. 

RKT is a ticking time bomb that relies on scale to create an incredible profit but that same scale creates Incredible risk. If at any point they can‚Äôt sell their loans to secondary market, the hose spraying water on an active fire dries up and the fire consumes all

2021-04-08 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Valuing Discovery Communications **TL;DR**: I am heavily invested in DISCA and don't want to drink the koolaid too much, so I decided to publish my analysis for criticism. **I find that even with conservative assumptions the shares are below fair value.** This still counts as WSB to me because I am now 4x levered on these shares.

Not all the below valuations are higher than current share price. I claim share price is conservatively below fair value because I think that even the absolute best case in these models is somewhat conservative.

**Background**

[I own a lot of Discovery, and I bought it at the peak (although I sold calls so its more like I bought it about 10% below the peak).](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mfs678/what_it_looks_like_if_you_were_170_invested_in/)

The stock has fluctuated wildly due to the Archegos blow up. [It isn't clear exactly whether the sell off is over or not](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-markets-blocktrades-stocks/archegos-linked-stocks-slide-as-markets-eye-more-unwinding-idUSKBN2BS1V1), so the stock still poses a potential buying opportunity if the price is depressed.

When I first bought, I assumed that the stock price said something about public opinion and then tried to address whether the marginal buyer's opinion was overly optimistic or pessimistic. But here, where its not clear that the market price says much about the company, a buying or selling decision requires an actual valuation. I don't like using multiples from comparable companies here, since I think Discovery's value lies principally in its market niche of unscripted content. So, I am using a Discounted Cash Flow method.

For the purpose of this analysis, I treated Discovery's cable and streaming services as two separate companies, except for the assumption that Discovery's cable revenue would continue to cover the costs of the streaming service for many years (including taxes). I offset that assumption by assuming no ad revenue on the streaming service and that all subscriptions would be at the cheapest price. Obviously these are rough assumptions, but all of this is fairly rough. I calculated Net Present Value on the declining net income from cable under three cases running 20 years out, and applied a Discounted Cash Flow valuation to streaming revenue with three sets of growth assumptions. I varied the discount and perpetuity growth rate as well.

In even the worst case I assume robust early subscription rates since the service got over 10 million subscribers in its first two months of launch and the company is aggressively marketing the service. If it turns out that the service just completely flops and dies, then obviously none of this applies. This may seem like an aggressive assumption, but the early subscriber numbers are much less important than the growth rate.

**As a result, we have three charts, each comparing nine unique sets of assumptions The resulting fair values are summarized in the charts below below.**

[Average Fair Value: $71.86](https://preview.redd.it/rccpxxnt4tr61.png?width=1441&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f1cc83134f4399c36f05372cab3359f4b44f9b5)

[Average Fair Value: 45.61](https://preview.redd.it/srigzoav4tr61.png?width=1441&format=png&auto=webp&s=1dafe1f47563e68f1260c0f3e54a1f6ee2bc9142)

&#x200B;

[Average Fair Value: $52.60](https://preview.redd.it/phr0z0lw4tr61.png?width=1946&format=png&auto=webp&s=bfb41e2e4023a0391de993064a4df7e2ce97d57e)

Overall Average: $56.69

The best case here is 210 million subscribers and then a 2% annual growth rate after that, with a low discount rate, while suffering a relatively mild decline in cable business over the next 20 years. But, Discovery's board is targeting 400 million global subscribers. If they are anywhere close to right about that the current price would be wildly under valued.

And, these all assume significant declines in cable revenue, which is not set in stone (though I did use pre-covid operating income for the moderate and best case declines in cable revenue). Before covid, Discovery had been averaging roughly 5% YOY increases in revenue, even after major acquisitions and impairments of goodwill. They had a massive move down in net income this past year, due to advertising revenue loss from covid and a surprisingly large tax burden.

My other beliefs about DISCA still apply (high margin niche content, subscription rate will beat expectations). I wrote up a long post about those in theta gang a few weeks ago [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/ma4ok2/discovery_communications_as_a_stable_theta_crop/).

In sum, I remain fully invested in these shares, and will not be selling unless something drastically changes for the worse. Am I just confirmation biasing myself and should I cut my losses?

Note: This is specifically for DISCA; I weighted the final share price by the current weight given to the different classes of shares as of noon today.

This is for the first chart. The other two are the same but with different discount and perpetuity growth rates."
2021-04-08 00:43:49,wallstreetbets,I love Discovery Plus. $4.99 a month and has over 10 main channels w all their content. It‚Äôs really the only streaming service I use now. Watching it right now. I also like the stock and bought some shares when the big dip happened.

2021-04-08 00:31:26,wallstreetbets,"The problem is the only person willing to buy these things higher up was Billy Hwang and he‚Äôs done now. Not sure where the marginal buyer or institutional money (I work for a fund) gets interested in these names - they are ‚Äúcheap‚Äù on a multiple / FCF basis, but the quality of the FCF is low (structural Risk at legacy cable cash flow, and unclear path to success in streaming which requires massive upfront investment). That said, the FCF does have a long tail to it - ie. legacy operations are melting Ice cubes that won‚Äôt melt overnight, so that might entice some but I think by and large these are value traps. Just my opinion though and I could be wrong of course."
2021-04-08 09:11:52,wallstreetbets,"Yep Archegos really bought a shockingly large portion of the company and it big time messed with the price. If you you were convinced of a realistic path to success in streaming would it be a justified investment to you? My idea/hope is basically that streaming numbers will smash expectations at earnings in May (but I had thought organic interest and the crazy high price indicated that's what was happening when it turned out it was just Bill Hwang, so its a little sketchy now lol)"

2021-04-07 23:01:25,wallstreetbets,"**Reason why $SPY will always go up**

Main requirements to join the S&P 500:

>last reported quarter must be profitable ‚úÖ

>aggregate profit generated over the trailing four quarters ‚úÖ

Companies are added and delisted a lot more often than you think!

Around 20 loser companies are delisted from S&P per year.

SPY adjusts to the economy, it can't go down by design, only companies that make money are allowed.

For example in 2020 they removed Macy's because retail was dead and added Carrier air-conditioning because everyone stuck at home needed AC. Look at where Carrier Global stock is at now.

SPY adjusts all the time and it will always go up.

#$SPY 590.00c DEC 15 2023

 just $400 per contract right now

Recently rolled over a roth with like 44k in it. Got options level 2. Told my wife I was using small bit for options and bought bullshit shares. Got account to 80k in like 3 weeks from TSLA puts. 

Took a bad beat Monday. Decided to now chase the TSLA boom and the lost unrealized gain. Sold everything and out remaining 55ishk into TSLA 692c for APR 23. 

Wife just came in room. I logged in on her phone once to my brokerage and it saved info. Asked why the hell everything was in TSLA and if those are short options (position down 20% already). Told her kinda short (lol).....

Says we need to talk cause I broke her trust. Told her we will talk when I get home tomorrow around 3pm.

So guys. Plz god I need TSLA to moon so when I get home I can login and be like see chill out I got this. If it tanks ill be under the 44k I originally put in and going to be bad.

P.S. Also have 4 AMZN 3270p.

2021-04-08 00:29:59,wallstreetbets,"Bruh, are you guys legit new here?

Futures are fake, mostly because they are low volume, and it's super easy for funds to manipulate them with $10-$50 mil. If you had $20 mil or so, you could literally single-handedly make a giant red or green candle right now. This is an open secret. And it's why they often completely reverse in the first 5 minutes of market open. 

So futures are important, not because of what they are, but because what they say. They are used by big players to position themselves for the next day.

Here's the short version: big players are using peanuts to rally futures so they can offload massive bags before JPow speaks. I've seen this shit a hundred times, and they literally do it *every fucking time* that nerd gets up to his podium.

MUCH more bullish on RIDE. Better team, better product (IMO), better direction, and much much further along in production and marketing. Also the sentiment from the team from RIDE was much more positive than GOEV. 

I honestly can't see these two companies having similar stock prices and market cap. RIDE is on track and will pop after SEC inquiry passes and they (hopefully) perform well in the Baja race this month. 

I can see RIDE 2X or 3X by EOY. Going to get out of my GOEV holdings and go all in on RIDE. 

Not advice. I'm retarded."

2021-04-08 04:52:48,wallstreetbets,"When I moved back to Boston from NY in ‚Äò05 I worked as a Exec Sous at S&W. We had a restaurant softball league Every Tuesday morning. My 1st game I woke up like 10 seconds before my ride showed up. We got a coffee, chain smoked Newports and got to the game. Got a double, next guy up hit a bomb. As I was rounding 3rd I sharted every stride I took. Thankfully no one was waiting at home for a high 5 because the wind caught up to me, it wasn‚Äôt pleasant. I took my buddy‚Äôs car, packed my ass crack with Dunkin‚Äô Donuts napkins and drove to my cousins house to, well, you know. She didn‚Äôt wake up so I had to go to the public bathroom at Sully‚Äôs. The stalls have no doors and rival the Dirtiest Toilet in Scotland. Also they had no toilet paper. Soooooo I used my boxers. Went back to the game, scored two more runs and went to work commando for the first and only time in my career. I split my pants mid shift, had to put two aprons on to cover everything, closed MJ O‚ÄôConnor‚Äôs and went home with this kinda hot kinda skanky server id been trying to bang for weeks. Moral of the story, a shitty morning can still have a happy ending."

A company like this sells for 5-10b right now. The bidding war pressure adds a few b to the price. The longer VUZI doesn't get bought out, the more they can milk Apple or Google for. 

For reference, discord just sold for 10b, they have a nice userbase but the technology isn't special. VUZI has patents for AR glasses that you can talk to and issue commands to, and a ton of other shit that you need for solid AR glasses."

2021-04-07 23:11:23,wallstreetbets,"I just downvoted your comment.
 
# FAQ
 
## What does this mean?
 
The amount of karma (points) on your comment and Reddit account has decreased by one.
 
## Why did you do this?
 
There are several reasons I may deem a comment to be unworthy of positive or neutral karma. These include, but are not limited to:
 
* Rudeness towards other Redditors,
* Spreading incorrect information,
* Sarcasm not correctly flagged with a `/s`.
 
## Am I banned from the Reddit?
 
No - not yet. But you should refrain from making comments like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.
 
## I don't believe my comment deserved a downvote. Can you un-downvote it?
 
Sure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a downvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.
 
## How can I prevent this from happening in the future?
 
Accept the downvote and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on Reddit.com. I will continue to issue downvotes until you improve your conduct. Remember: Reddit is privilege, not a right."
2021-04-07 21:07:08,wallstreetbets,You‚Äôre comment history is fucking retarded lmao

2021-04-08 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Hitch a $RIDE to the Moon: Technical Analysis of Lordstown Motors **PART 1: Introduction**

Disclaimer: This is not financial advice. I might be the guy who used his emergency fund to take out puts on SPY, why would you blindly listen to me? Trading is a hobby for me and I hope to share a potentially great find with you all and teach some new skills along the way

This might not be the first time you have heard of Lordstown Motors ($RIDE). It seems people are finally starting to warm up to the company now that some positive news has come out, and I‚Äôm all for it. I‚Äôve been chart watching this for a while and I‚Äôm glad people are finally starting to see through the veil of drama and realize being bullish on a prospective company is not some pipe dream, a feeling plenty of you should be familiar with. Because since when do we find Hindenburg Research, literally five dudes with a lot of money and a focus on ‚Äúactivist short selling‚Äù, coming in like your wife‚Äôs mean boyfriend on Christmas eve to tell you that Santa Clause isn‚Äôt real, to be a credible source?

But enough metaphors. Lordstown motors is an electric vehicle focused on developing the Endurance, an electric full-size pickup truck. If any of you are like me, you aren‚Äôt convinced by just one guy on the internet screaming ‚Äú$STONK to the moon!‚Äù, you need to see proof that Lady Market is having another mood swing and changing her mind on the stock.

So that‚Äôs what I intend to do. I won‚Äôt give you the same boring old rundown of fundamentals that you get plenty of. If you want some of that [check out the post that was just made on the subject](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mkt7qi/the_bullcase_for_lordstown_motors_corporation/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). Instead, using technical analysis and a bunch of pretty crayon drawings, I will prove that not just I, but the market is changing its tone towards $RIDE. I‚Äôve learned that the way to make significant money in this market is to find and bet on [oversold stocks like $RIDE](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/lordstown-motors-becomes-oversold-ride-2021-04-05) that have all of the FUD priced in; live and die by the motto ‚Äúbuy the fear, sell the greed‚Äù. I believe $RIDE is the type of stock that traders will begin to buy hand over fist in the coming days and weeks, and hopefully I can teach some fresh blood a new skill along the way.

If you find yourself falling asleep at any point, just skip through and look at the pretty pictures like a Dr Seuss book.

**PART 2: Technical Analysis**

Now, as I already laid out, I believe that $RIDE is undervalued, however my style of trading rarely forms opinions based off of fundamentals alone. I prefer to trade on indicators. Many people have told me I read tea leaves, they call me John D Cuckefeller, and if you feel the same then read no further. But it's no coincidence that stocks tend to follow these indicators, and they are what led me to start liking the stock to begin with.

**Volume and Short Interest:**

Before we get into the technical analysis, I‚Äôd like to address this sub‚Äôs favorite market mechanic: short sales. According to the numbers given to us by [Fintel](https://fintel.io/ss/us/ride), short volume reached its recent peak directly after the short report, and has largely fallen and consolidated since then. Why are we seeing a consolidation period after a short attack? It is my belief that many of the shorts are beginning to take their profits and leave, realizing the stock has the potential for a huge rally. Not only are they scared of people like you, who will target a stock just to hurt short-sellers, but they also realize that we have found the floor for this stock and will begin an upswing off of this, and don‚Äôt want to stick around to be spammed with diamond emojis and prank pizza orders for Harambe to their moms house.

Even given all this, $RIDEs short volume is up 46 percent from last month, [to a total of 12.5 percent the total float](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/RIDE/short-interest/). And even more interesting to me is the fact that since the recent [reveal of the endurance betas](https://www.vindy.com/news/local-news/2021/04/lmc-reveals-endurance-betas/) the short volume ratio has increased again to around 24 percent with no significant increase in volume. No significant changes in volume and an increase in short interest from an actual working product? Sounds like a few people had too much of a vested interest in Lordstown being ‚Äú3-4 years away from production‚Äù like the bears claimed.

This is, in my opinion, *very significant* as it indicates the catalyst is probably not priced into the stock yet.

**Relative Strength**

For anyone who‚Äôs a fan of indicators, it should be obvious that $RIDE is massively oversold, to the point where demand can‚Äôt go anywhere but up. Just look at any relative strength oscillator; many traders use the RSI but I prefer to use the Stochastics. I won‚Äôt get too mathematical on you, but this chart essentially shows us the demand of a stock. Pretty simple. $RIDE has been in the 20th percentile oversold range for some time now, and is just starting to creep out now that demand is increasing for the stock. Rumors can‚Äôt last forever and the market is showing uncertainty in the current downward momentum. This should be seen as the first sign of renewed investor confidence in the company.

&#x200B;

[The relative strength of $RIDE, shown by Stochastics. More oversold just means more fuel for the explosion](https://preview.redd.it/jdeugezrvsr61.png?width=1170&format=png&auto=webp&s=a32d3b1fa3326fdff20c09b406c4780db04df869)

**MACD:**

This indicator line nicely plots out momentum behind current movements and can tell you when support in the opposite direction is beginning to form. Don‚Äôt overcomplicate this; when the purple line is above the orange line, the stock (often) goes up, and when it‚Äôs below the orange line it goes down. Traders use the crossovers of these two lines as an indicator of breakout events. In times of high volatility, violent swings in the MACD above and below the centerline can often result in violent reversals when they cross again. A great example can be seen with the MACD a couple weeks ago on a favorite around here; GameStop:

&#x200B;

[MACD analysis on GME. Anyone else remember the massive FUD during this time?](https://preview.redd.it/hl89sol1wsr61.jpg?width=1185&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=458e07447e4bc8462a3e6e982d2e67d493010e1d)

I noticed this crossover beginning to form, and that week when everyone was shitting on GME I bought more like any good retard would do. The MACD predicted the reversal perfectly by showing how downwards momentum was beginning to shift. The violent downswing below the centerline resulted in a violent upswing, and the rest should be obvious. A crossover event occurred and it rocketed from 40 to 150+ the very next day. I couldn't predict how much it would go up but one thing was clear: the MACD told us it was very unlikely to go down more, and in a time of great FUD, I bought more.

Now lets take a look at the MACD for $RIDE. Does the chart below give anyone else D√©j√† vu? Or did is it just me? Using what we've learned about the MACD and seeing the real-world example with GME, just take a look for yourself with $RIDE:

&#x200B;

[MACD analysis on $RIDE, looking absolutely bullish AF. A thing of beauty üöÄüöÄüöÄ](https://preview.redd.it/vsf3zynawsr61.png?width=1184&format=png&auto=webp&s=0970eb9794859538a9eade2fe7ab539c10842080)

This was the first thing I noticed when I found this stock a couple weeks ago. Historically, the MACD has predicted massive uptrends before based on being very far below the center. Similarly, we recently had another event that spread mass doubt on $RIDE and pushed the MACD far below the center line in a violent manner (I wonder what it was).

Despite the price continuing to decrease the past 2 weeks, the MACD line has flattened out and finally crossed the signal line in orange. This is a good sign that negative pressure is decreasing and one thing is for sure, the stock is not likely to go much lower in the short term. With the recent dip in the moving average being so far below the centerline, $RIDE is honestly primed for ignition and I've been buying. When you see a MACD like this, I don‚Äôt really have many reasons not to buy and follow the trend except maybe if the Great Depression Part 2 is starting.

**Price Action:**

PRICE ACTION!!!

The most important indicator of all. It's easy to get caught up in all the pretty colors and forget about the bigger picture of price action. A change in things like volume and overall trend means more than any indicator, which should be used to contextualize the price action and not the other way around. For the sake of simplicity, I won‚Äôt go too far into this one. Individual candlesticks are valuable, but in the bigger picture we can see that the current price seems to be at a historical floor at the moment, and more importantly, the price action and volume is trading in a narrow range of consolidation for the past week or so. Specifically, a breakout above 14 dollars or below 10 could easily spark a much greater movement of volume and price. We don‚Äôt need to force anything or look at fancy charts to figure this out, but instead just look at the actions of real market participants.

Combining the price action with the other indicators to give context is where things get really juicy and we can find some unexpected things.

[Positive divergence of the MACD and price action. Momentum is increasing against a bearish price trend, and price is now consolidating before liftoff](https://preview.redd.it/0k28fdixwsr61.png?width=1622&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ed734f7bac97d0982b7f0791bf4e6df33c3b017)

Instead of the smooth 1-day period chart, we‚Äôre looking at a 4-hour period for more details. Notice how the price action has been in a trend down but the MACD has been in a trend up? This is called positive divergence, and is a result of a stocks momentum not agreeing with its current trending direction, which is a pretty big deal. Many traders use divergence in addition to the other indicators to assess the likelihood of a reversal, and based on the other factors and presence of a catalyst, I believe a reversal is being foreshadowed right in front of us. As of just yesterday, April 6th, the divergence resulted in the MACD crossing above the centerline, indicating that the price action has started seeking an uptrend. This is significant reason to believe that a breakout above resistance is much more likely than a crash, a huge amount of upward pressure is building. The price is currently consolidating in an area of low volatility, and though I don‚Äôt want to get too far into the Bollinger Band indicator, this could result in a ‚Äú[Bollinger Band Squeeze](https://www.tradingsetupsreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/BollingerandKeltnerSqueezeExample.jpg)‚Äù upwards very soon.

These are the indicators I use for any stock I look at, and for $RIDE specifically, the technical upside far outweighs the downside for me. There is just too much potential for an explosion right now upwards of $30-$35, and not enough potential for a further crash, to justify ignoring this.

**PART 3: Catalysts and Fundamentals**

Since indicators are driven by price action, which is itself driven by catalysts, they usually won‚Äôt run far without some sort of news to cling on to. As far as catalysts go, Lordstown did just release their [beta trucks](https://lordstownmotors.com/blogs/news/celebrating-the-first-lordstown-endurance-betas) last week. News which, I cannot stress enough, *I DO NOT THINK THIS CATALYST IS PRICED IN YET* as discussed earlier. They are also [showcasing their truck in one of the most brutal proving grounds imaginable at the SCORE San Felipe 250 off-road race](https://www.autoweek.com/racing/more-racing/a35598958/lordstown-endurance-ev-pickups-baja-debut-is-serious-business/) in Mexico's Baja California Peninsula on April 17 (less than 10 days away). Not to mention their market cap when compared to their worse-off competitors. The current price just doesn‚Äôt make sense.

I also I like the design of the truck itself; image is everything, especially when compared to some of its competitors (I‚Äôm sorry Canoo bulls but wtf is that thing? Not to mention the Cybertruck). Lordstown is targeting commercial fleets and government contracts initially. Yesterday, the Camping World CEO tweeted a [leak to an RV that Lordstown is working on](https://twitter.com/marcuslemonis/status/1379433681995984905?s=20) (the Lordstown logo is in the center of the wheel) through [their partnership](https://investor.campingworld.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2020/Camping-World-and-Lordstown-Motors-Partner-to-Establish-Nationwide-EV-Service-Network-Announce-Plans-to-Develop-Electric-Solutions-for-the-RV-Industry-e59212362/default.aspx). The electric RV market could be huge. The catalysts are plenty but the market is still timid, for now.

**PART 4: Conclusion**

Well, I hope you learned a few things from this post, even if I end up being wrong about everything I laid out here. As I stated, this is not my full-time job; I do this as a hobby. Feel free to ask me any questions regarding this info; I know some of the technical analysis can be confusing. Knowledge is power among the knowledge impaired.

And for $RIDE specifically, the technical upside far outweighs the downside for me. It has all the same signals that make me love other big names around here, and there is just too much potential for an explosion right now and not enough potential for a further crash, to justify ignoring this. Lest we all forget [Morgan Stanley‚Äôs 10$ price target on Tesla](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/21/morgan-stanley-tesla-shares-could-drop-to-10-in-worst-case-scenario.html), have a good $RIDE everyone, and don‚Äôt let the short bugs bite.

**Positions:** 65 shares at 12.94, 2x $20 07/16C, 1x 15$ 01/21/22c

**EDIT:** Forgot to add, but per page 21 of [this slide deck](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/static-files/ef77bce6-b19a-4288-a651-e08089f1362f), the current replacement value of Lordstown‚Äôs 6.2 million square foot factory is over $3 billion, but the current market cap of $RIDE is only $2.01 billion. An EV stock that is trading almost 50% below its asset value? Come on now. Everything I‚Äôm seeing is screaming buy.

**TLDR;**

I love $RIDE‚Äôs pretty charts, and there is way too much technical upside here to ignore. IMO, $RIDE is poised for a breakout, and this is the type of chart that technical traders will begin noticing and placing big bets on. $RIDE to the moon üöÄüöÄüöÄ"

A company that has never made anything being able to get another company to pony up millions on a promise seems far-fetched to me.

Building a car isn‚Äôt easy. Look how long it took Tesla to get up to production. If Lordstown had a head start it would be one thing but they are going to be going up against experienced manufacturers. The big guys will have a big head start on them by the time they reach full production too.

They are also building a truck with a frame and slapping a battery in it. The only electric vehicle with a frame. They obviously didn‚Äôt design this thing - it is a carryover of something else. That tells me they have never designed a vehicle and their next model could be a long way out. Maybe too far.

With all that being said I could be right and the stock price could still triple from here before they go out leaving a ton of money to be made. What a time to be alive!"

Pay later pre-orders.¬†The customer places their order now with the intention to pay in the future. There‚Äôs an understanding that both the seller and the buyer can back out of this deal in the future as money hasn‚Äôt changed hands yet.

When the Electric money frenzy ends it has to come down a little.  Plus the surge in demand for Silicon over the pandemic.  A lot of people were buying PCs at inflated prices because they were stuck at home.  Now, they can actually go outside.  If the digital money bubble pops AMD might hit 50 - 60.They are beating the crap out of intel in benchmarks.  But, they are still getting kicked around by nVidia.  Plus, the next phase of computing is custom ARM chips.  Intel is getting into it.  Microsoft is getting into it and a number of others.  Don't get me wrong AMD can compete.   But, they are not going to be gaining 20 percent annually.

But, I personally ( not financial advice) think GM stock can only go down.  It is to high as it is.  If you had money in the stock before that is great.  But, when the government changes interest rates I bet it drops down to more realistic levels.

Plus, I have some issue with how GM has been designing their cars in the past few years.  My family was a hardcore GM family.  But, I was thinking my next vehicle might be a Dodge.  Chevy has been making their cars more difficult to self repair...which defeats the purpose of buying a chevy.  The only two reason to buy a chevy is because it is easy to self repair and it is Union.  Now, they out source and make it hard to repair.

But, it would be nice to ride a company from 11 up to 50 or 60 or up to telsa price if possible.

2021-04-08 00:12:46,wallstreetbets,"My point is that you should not overstate the importance of the GM plant. It is important for an early stage company as definitely cuts down a lot on costs of being able to produce their initial cars by a lot, but it does not translate easily into successfully getting to mass production. Also the GM relationship is whatever it is, but look, Nikola had major investment from GM as well (I think GM put far more cash into Nikola, here GM gave them a nonproductive asset primarily), and what did that result in?

Beyond this, the claims of being able to sell it for $20K less is just a claim until they actually sell them for that price (will this be like everyone else that says they will eventually produce a cheap version but the initial production will all be super-expensive stuff... e.g. look at Lucid). As to mass production, it is a long road from producing 2 Beta builds to mass production, especially for a company that has not yet mass produced vehicles. Maybe they get there, but they got a lot of proving to do.

As to the stock itself, I have no idea. I am bearish on it overall but if they pull off an impressive performance in their heavily modified truck for the San Felipe 250 I can see the stock taking off a bit. Beyond that, based on what I have seen from virtually every other EV maker (including Tesla) projections as to when they are getting to production are rarely met. I think sooner or later they will have to affirmatively confront the issues Hindenburg and others (e.g. whether they can economically solve the unsprung mass related issues) have raised and if they can't the share price will suffer."

In any case, with Nikola the Hindenburg report was far worse as the company showed a truck that they claimed or implied was powered by Hydrogen when in fact it was rolling downhill. At least RIDE had an actual vehicle with the in wheel motor (and has since shown the video with two more Betas). The issues are much more technical as to whether it is viable candidate for mass produced trucks.

(fyi, I said this before, but beyond just looking bad and being deceptive the preorder debacle does not concern me much as frankly anyone that can mass produce economically an EV truck will have customers lined up... does not make it okay to overstate the facts but, for me at least, does not fundamentally alter the analysis of the company here... in other words, if I thought the in wheel stuff would work out I would likely have a Bullish outlook on RIDE assuming the fundamentals added up to me)

2021-04-08 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"[Day Trading] Found this absolute fucking gem on the internet describing exactly what counts as a day trade and how you can get diddled by the PDT fairy if you're broke (sub $25k) and not careful. Educate yourselves, or don't. I probably don't even have enough karma to even get this posted üçå  

# What are ""Day Trades"" and how are they counted?

Tip: Read from the bottom up if you want the juiciest examples first

A day trade is buying and selling the same security on the same day in a margin account.¬†Day trades are counted based on the opening transaction and whether that opening transaction was closed out on the same day.¬†Partial fills are not counted as multiple trades on the opening or closing side. However, if part of your order fills, and then you modify it and the rest fills, that may be counted as two¬†day trades.

Examples of day trading:

* On Tuesday, 100 shares of XYZ stock are purchased. Later on that same day, 100 shares of XYZ stock are sold. This is considered to be a day trade.


* On Monday, 10 shares of XYZ stock are purchased. Later on that same day, 5 shares of XYZ stock are sold. This is considered to be a day trade.


* On Thursday, 50 shares of XYZ stock are purchased. On Friday, another 50 shares of XYZ stock are purchased. Later on that Friday, 50 shares of XYZ stock are sold. This is considered to be one day trade.


* On Wednesday, 100 shares of XYZ are purchased. Later that same day, you sell 50 shares of XYZ and before the market close you sell another 50 shares of XYZ. This is one day trade. In this case, even though you sold your 100 shares of XYZ in two separate transactions, it still counts as one day trade because one single opening transaction was closed out.


* On Monday, 50 shares of XYZ are purchased. Later that day, another 50 shares of XYZ are purchased. Before the market close on Monday, 100 shares of XYZ are sold. This is two day trades. Here, we have two opening transactions closed by a single sell order. The first group of 50 shares of XYZ was bought and sold on the same day, and a second group of 50 shares was also bought and sold on the same day.


* On Friday, you put in 2 buy orders of 50 shares of XYZ. You then sell 51 shares of XYZ later that day. This is also two day trades. All 50 shares from the first opening transaction were bought and sold on the same day. One share from the second opening transaction was bought and sold on the same day. Even though only one share from Order 2 was sold, the purchase and sale of that single share in a single trading day counts as a day trade.


* On Wednesday, 3 orders are made: Buy 2 shares of XYZ, Buy 5 shares of XYZ, and Buy 50 shares of XYZ. Later that same day, an order to Sell 50 shares of XYZ is made. This is three day trades. We pair the closing transaction with the opening orders during that trading day, beginning with the earliest time of execution.

if you are making a move then i think the take away is to get in strong and not cross that initial quantity unless your willing to get a 2nd Day trade hit.   


I have 1 I'm waiting to roll off from having to flip a share or tow of GME to free up liquidity ( since replaced) but i bought back fractionally multiple times through out the day.   


So by initiating the sequence with a single sale transactions, all my subsequent dip purchases for the rest of the day still fell under a single day trade. It seems the danger in unexpected ones comes from stocks purchased on the day.   


I learned something out of that - one more wrinkle"

all counted as 1 day trade. Had it been Buys to sells that could be dicey. I appreciate the work to share it, it has value, and it helped me at least.   


Good luck out there."

2021-04-08 01:00:32,wallstreetbets,"The biggest gotcha with cash account day trading is the wash sale rule. Just follow this flow:

1. Never sell for a loss
2. If you have to break rule one, never buy the stock again for 31 days
3. If you have to break rule 2 make sure you fully exit the position and cease trading before the end of the year.
4. If you have to break rule 3, get ready to pay the entire gain of your cash volume in capital gains. If you traded 10k on one stock and the wash carries, that's 10k in capital gains you owe now. It sucks so don't be dumb with it."
2021-04-08 00:53:25,wallstreetbets,"If we're talking about a cash account, funds will settle in t+2 on any trade, you can do anything you want with settled funds in a cash account. Make 10 entries and exits on one stock, doesn't matter so long as you're trading settled cash."
2021-04-08 02:18:03,wallstreetbets,"I think the term here is ""touche"".

Also the app ""market"" is very different than the stock ""market"". Sec gives zero fucks about the Google play store. Fact is they shouldn't have an app. It should be pulled entirely along with their license to operate. 

Paying my buddies in Congress to roast their ass.... That would be market manipuliation. Leaving a one star review of an app I did download, then giving it an accurate 1 star because I can't trade because their company can't cover orders... Is not. 

(Gave your comment an up cause people deserve opinions... Like in an app store review)"
2021-04-08 00:47:18,wallstreetbets,I am on Fidelity and it allows fractional. The desktop app is very good as well.
2021-04-08 01:03:59,wallstreetbets,I don't day trade at all. I'm a very simple investor. Buy hold. I commented earlier today how I'm not really interested in options training and lo and behold received an email from Motley Fool about their upcoming FREE MASTERCLASS: MASTERING OPTIONS FOR BEGINNERS. Let's see if my admitting I'm not into day trading triggers any of the algorithms sifting through this sub and I get bombarded with courses on OUR FULL PROOF DAY TRADING SYSTEM. Could be a wild coincidence too. I feel the entire financial services industry is a lot of smoke and mirrors and the people who make big short term gains are either deeply more informed than I am or dumb lucky. So for now I don't bother. SPY is fine. IVW is cool. Just in it so my money doesn't rapidly devalue from inflation and I can forget about it for bare minimum 15 but more like 30 years.
2021-04-08 09:32:48,wallstreetbets,"That‚Äôs not how a wash sale works. 

You don‚Äôt pay capital gains on $10k. 

FFS who is spreading this fud


Eg

- Cost basis 10k (1000s @ $10)

- Sell for 9k (1000s @ $9)

At this point you had a loss of 1k. You don‚Äôt pay capital gains on 9k.  You can actually claim $1k in loses. 

- Rebuy for 10k (1000s @ $10) *wash sale*

You still don‚Äôt pay capital gains on the previous $9k. But now you can‚Äôt claim $1k in losses.  **Instead your new cost basis is adjusted to be $11 (1000s @ $11)**"
2021-04-08 00:58:13,wallstreetbets,"Again I'm not deliberately trying to test your patience, I just do not play with money in my brokerage account beside buying SPY and IVW and never selling. If I understand you correctly, let's say once you buy $5000 worth of shares in let's say AMC on Monday, those funds will be considered settled Thursday. Now once those funds have settled I can buy and sell as much AMC as I want? I'm not following you can you be more specific what you mean by settled cash. When I Google settled cash the major returns are for Fidelity."
2021-04-08 10:39:10,wallstreetbets,Appreciate the response and I concede your point! Well said.
2021-04-08 16:10:00,wallstreetbets,"They're talking about multiple transactions. There are no gains in your example so of course you dont pay on any gains.

Imagine instead: you buy 100 XYZ at 80 dollars, get out a week later at 100 dollars (you now have 100x20$= 2000 cap gains), 2 weeks later you buy another 100 XYZ at 90 dollars, however it drops to 70 dollars and you paper hands out (that's 100x20$=2000 losses, this should cancel out your capital gains). However, you dont respect wash sale rule and now 1 week later you realize you paperhanded and rebuy 100 XYZ at 80 dollars. Because you didnt respect wash sale, you cant claim that 2k losses if you hold this through the end of the year (increasing cost basis doesnt do shit if you dont exit) , that means you cant cancel out your 2k gains. You'll have to pay taxes on 2k gains even though your net profit is 0 and thus have no money to pay the taxes."
2021-04-08 01:12:46,wallstreetbets,"Settled cash comes from closed positions. Here's a scenario with 10k in cash.

1. Buy 100 shares ($1k amc Monday)
2. Balance is now 9k settled cash, account value is still 10k.
3. Sell 50 shares the same day for $600 total. Doesn't matter how you sell it, 10 shares at a time or whatever.
4. Balance is still 9k settled on Monday
5. Wednesday (T+2), you get the $600 trade settled. You can now use 9.6k (9000 + 600) to trade however you please.

The date that you press the sell button, it takes two days before you can technically use that same money again for trades. You can break that rule but the broker may prevent you from trading in the future."
2021-04-08 17:30:55,wallstreetbets,"Yes you have to pay taxes on the 2k gains in that example since when you paperhanded rebought @80  it‚Äôs like you never closed that position. 

Your cost basis is increased when you sell the following year.  So you will just claim the differences next year. 

Day traders trade so many stocks so wash sales from other years will cancel out it the end."
2021-04-08 01:18:30,wallstreetbets,Buy sell with a T+2 wait for the sale to be settled cash. If I read that right. How is this better or worse than margin? I understand margin as like a side credit account essentially. I have always turned down margin when it's been offered it sounds for me like it's more likely to go south than to be advantageous.
2021-04-08 17:33:54,wallstreetbets,"Increase this by 10x or 100x. Sure you'll get to claim your losses or reduced basis next year, but does that help if you owe taxes on 200k this year? Not really.

Also if you end net loss you only get to claim 3k a year against regular income, losses are only very efficient when they're canceling gains from the current year."
2021-04-08 01:22:39,wallstreetbets,"On margin you can't really trade the same security actively unless you have over 25k in account value.

On cash you're constrained by this time rule, so unless you have self restraint you may get locked out of trading for a few days.

Since 25k is a heavy price to pay for many, cash is a lower barrier for entry and less risky."
2021-04-08 01:27:34,wallstreetbets,"So provided you're not maxing out your settled cash in active trades, it seems pretty straightforward how this gets around the need for trading on margin. Still not something I'm likely to get into though. I just like the idea of a set it and forget it approach to long term gains."

""ImpVolatility"" peaked at 180% today

Thats +9%

4/16 800c closed at 0.45 yesterday and was around 0.57 today after volatility peaked. 

Thats 5% off the estimated price of 0.54 based on the vega. Seems in line to me."

2021-04-07 22:11:29,wallstreetbets,"The play isn't to wait for it to hit 800, it's to sell on a violent move that forces MM to buy up wing risk.

2021-04-08 00:10:51,wallstreetbets,correct. I also grabbed more july calls at various strikes this week.

2021-04-08 07:45:29,wallstreetbets,Theres a lot of stocks available to borrow on iborrowdesk unfortunately. DFV 500 calls will probably scratch but not dent the market.

2021-04-08 00:45:35,wallstreetbets,And this means?
2021-04-08 00:07:37,wallstreetbets,I mean it‚Äôs been dead flat for two weeks and the price starts sliding down.  Last time it slid it ramped back up with thunder.   I honestly thinks it‚Äôs the IV volatility.  My 4/9 calls went up too.
2021-04-07 20:13:55,wallstreetbets,Right. Some people in this thread are acting like this is some sort of cryptic message or some shit. It‚Äôs just the IV increased lmao
2021-04-08 17:54:43,wallstreetbets,The price action didn‚Äôt seem wild enough to cause that rise in IV. Which is what was strangest to me.
2021-04-07 22:15:25,wallstreetbets,if it hits anywhere close to 400 it‚Äôll probably hit 50-100 easily. the last gamma squeeze $2 contracts jumped to 80 by next morning lol. I‚Äôm hoping for a red open so I can grab calls for <7
2021-04-07 23:48:55,wallstreetbets,I don‚Äôt think ppl realize 800c doesn‚Äôt have to be ITM to actually profit. the calls are lower than its ever been and IV is flattening with all the sideways movement.
2021-04-08 02:22:29,wallstreetbets,"IV has bottomed out, hedgies have been stepping on the share price hard to keep the stock FLAT by taking reverse trades through order flow because it is a money printing machine selling short term options. Now it isn't worth them holding on to all of that order flow and they will open the flood gates and the stock will MOON. Afterwards the IV will be so high they will rinse and repeat."
2021-04-08 01:14:31,wallstreetbets,"I mean who knows tbh, like i said last time i saw this i bought a few calls and then gme went 300% a few days later. I‚Äôm willing to roll the dice here"

2021-04-08 00:09:41,wallstreetbets,"OP is right, IV is now 178%, down from 350% on March 10th. I also grabbed July 800s."
2021-04-07 21:13:12,wallstreetbets,I had a call during 3/10 fuckery that I think was around 700 or 800. I‚Äôd imagine they are much lower than that now.
2021-04-07 21:58:21,wallstreetbets,We are around 150%
2021-04-07 22:57:41,wallstreetbets,Buy low. IV going up from here

2021-04-07 22:09:48,wallstreetbets,"TBH, probably, but look at liquidity for 800c. When shit gets wild, bid/ask spread gets wide as a truck for all options. Even the 800c. IMO the best bang for buck if one is playing IV expansion is wing risk on items with high liquidity.

This is also why shit like 1p has a bajillion contracts open btw. No one thinks its getting down to 1, this is purely people abusing MM wing risk"

5. 4/20 blaze it
6. TLRY earnings on 05/10

2021-04-08 09:36:05,wallstreetbets,"So I have 500 shares at $26....
Obviously it‚Äôs down $10 per share
Do I buy more APHA or just hold for now?

2021-04-08 09:57:04,wallstreetbets,"If you‚Äôre bullish long term, well then I‚Äôd suggest buying the dip. Also, since you‚Äôve already got 500 APHA, I‚Äôd choose to open up exposure with its counterpart TLRY. That‚Äôs just my two cents. Personally, I‚Äôm continuing to add contracts as it dips. I‚Äôm at about 50% of my total position as of now, hoping to be filled up by Friday."

2021-04-08 00:31:58,wallstreetbets,"Honestly the best thing that you can do is invest in a ROTH IRA tied to an S&P 500 Index Fund. ROTHs are funded with after tax money, but you pay no tax when the money comes out. Since the true rate of taxation is actually the rate of spending (see 22 trillion dollar debt) taxes are probably going to be 120% in 50 years...

If you're looking for higher risk/reward then read some DD from these retards. Personally I have $20k in RKT as a long term hold stable company with great upside."

Just keep fuckin' that chicken because you've got time in your side.  The years now matter a hell of a lot more than the years ahead."
2021-04-08 07:56:03,wallstreetbets,"Depends on when you bought them. If you bought 21 shares 40$ a piece then fair enough, if you bought 21 shares at 200$ a piece, then you have nothing to worry about.

Also you're 21, depending you're based it should/not be a concern. Also on many other factors... Actually i would take a step back and just say - you're 21 the best investment you can do for yourself is stop comparing yourself with others.

2021-04-07 23:43:11,wallstreetbets,"Roth IRAs are more complicated. Contributions can always be pulled.

I'm not going to do that thing you see on Investors Hub, or that we started seeing here when GME popped off - inundating you with so much info that you skip it and think ""gee this must be a good play."" Sometimes the simplest answer is the correct one:

Black folk like Cheesecake Factory. White folk like Cheesecake Factory. Asian folk like Cheesecake factory. Hispanic folk like Cheesecake factory.

* Vaccines are rolling out. 
* Lots of areas are going to be fully open by mid June. 
* Cheesecake Factory is in a sweet spot cost-wise. Poor man's Ruth's Chris/Mortons and a Rich Man's McDonalds. Accessible to many, liked by all.

$CAKE sitting around $60 at the moment. 65C's with a late May expiry are goin for around $200.

Seems like a pretty decent speculative play. It should run up as the country opens and the guidance for Summer is usually the best of the four seasons. Great guidance on the earnings call (first week of May) can push this to **80 by July 4th** easily.

My two cents, not investment advice"

I don't give a shit what semantic nonsense you're on. You clearly can't infer his usage of the gamblers fallacy. A stock ""running up"" isn't evidence that it's not going to continue to go up further. It's no different than someone flipping heads (this will be the metaphor of a stock going up) multiple times, and now expecting a tails (stock goes down).

Helpfrom my man G with research assist from /u/sublette313

**NOTE: REGARDLESS OF REASON HOW ABOUT THEM PLUG PUTS**

****

With the help of a WHOLE lot of you, G and I think we know the most logical way(s) to use the information gleaned from BlackRock-Ageddon 1.  For the uninitiated, please check out BlackRock-Ageddon in Yeet no. 1

**Refresher**: *BlackRock ETFs ICLN/INRG track the SPDJI Clean Energy ETF, an index that has a high concentration in only 30 holdings.  After consultations, they have decided it‚Äôs time to expand, so that the performance of a small number of companies don‚Äôt overly influence the entire index.  On 4/19, the changes will take effect, and on 4/2 they produced an internal document of pro-formas. As a tracker of this index, BlackRock ETFs ICLN/INRG will need to purchase and sell significant portions of their holdings.*


[ICLN Top Ten Holdings](https://i.imgur.com/g6O3EAs.jpg)

****

When calling the SPDJI on Friday for the pro-forma files, I was stonewalled.  There was a workaround found by our newest Research Associate, the incredible /u/sublette313, that allowed us to get crucial info, but we‚Äôll get to that in a moment.  First I want to give our further thinking and highlight reader feedback, and present what‚Äôs logical by process of elimination.  These are our wrenches:

**Dark Pools and Blocks:** lots of the necessary movement will happen through dark pools and block sells, making this less of an ‚Äúoh shit, we‚Äôre going to watch all this dump live!‚Äù scenario, and more a shady slow-burn of shifting.  There is still many-a-play, but it will be more subtle than some kind of Y2K.

**The lack of pro-forma files** released publicly means that what we have is a very, very strong hunch on what will be added to the index.  But we got a research assist (below).

**The most profitable way to play this in our estimation is shares or calls in the tickers to be added with the smallest market caps**.  These, logically, would be the biggest movers as they would be greatly influenced not only by the required institutional purchasing happening in clandestine ways, but also a) the news cycle and wider release of information and b) the literal, additional purchase benefits of being an added ticker to the index.  

In the first DD we provided a document from SPDJI called a ‚Äú[consultation](https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/documents/indexnews/announcements/20210312-1335572/1335572_spglobalcleanenergyconsultexpscorecountweightingupdated3-12-2021.pdf)‚Äù, which really means ‚Äúupdated blueprint‚Äù.  /u/sublette313 really dug into this, and here‚Äôs what he found.  Inside the ‚Äú[consultation](https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/documents/indexnews/announcements/20210312-1335572/1335572_spglobalcleanenergyconsultexpscorecountweightingupdated3-12-2021.pdf)‚Äô and boy was it a jackpot if you had the patience to keep looking.

The ‚Äú**Eligible Universe Summary (Oct 20)**‚Äù tab of the spreadsheet gives us a list of 74 potential adds identified by SPDJI.  Okay, AND...
The ‚Äú**Current Consultation‚Äù** [gives us a list of 68 tickers identified by SPDJI this month.](https://i.imgur.com/iiNDDYz.jpg) 
I‚Äôll wait a moment for you to click the ‚Äòcurrent consultation‚Äô tab, in red.  Find what I‚Äôve labeled here as‚Ä¶.`[YES](https://i.imgur.com/0xH4cuF.jpg)‚Äô.

**Now, I‚Äôm not necessarily saying this is an exact list of many of the current companies THAT ALSO INCLUDES A BUNCH OF NEW COMPANIES to be added with the proposed weighting.  What I AM saying is that this is a selection of energy companies...chosen by SPDJI...with a ‚Äòhypothetical‚Äô list of energy stocks that have had new weighting applied...in a tab called current consultation...that are filtered from a tab THEY‚ÄôVE labeled ‚Äúhypothetical universe‚Äù.**  

There‚Äôs also a **cool column here to the right** that G pointed out. It can help you screen by showing what percentage of the stock would be at owned 5, 10, or 15 billion ownership stake.  [This tells what companies (small) can be most affected by coming purchasing‚Äî ‚Äòthe good shit‚Äô](https://i.imgur.com/WzStwmy.jpg)

****

We‚Äôve sorted through, and this is the list that sticks out to us.  We did not just throw a dart--these choices reflect some combination of UOA, RAMBO, charting, fundament---AW WHO AM I KIDDING. HELL, WE LIKE THE STOCK!:

**For calls we like:**

**The low-cap (~5b and under) tickers listed in the ‚ÄòCurrent Consultation‚Äô**: FCEL, SPWR, CWEN, TPIC

**A grade** in ‚Äúcurrent consultation‚Äù: PCG

B grade in ‚Äúcurrent consultation‚Äù: FCEL, SPWR, JKS

**Honorable mention that didn‚Äôt make it in the consultation:** BE

**Notably not included in the consultation**: BLNK, VST

**VERY BULLISH NEE REGARDLESS**

**We are also bearish on PLUG** still with this development, but will need to update particulars pending more looks at purchase volume and flow PM Monday. 

**Watch List **- option chain doesn't offer any clues/illiquid, but everyone should be on the lookout for UOA: IDA, ENIA, ORA, HE, AVA, AY, ELP, DQ, ROCK, TPIC, GPRE

**We will monitor UOA and open interest on these tickers starting Monday.** What this DD showed is that it‚Äôs not what‚Äôs in the news, but it‚Äôs in the way that you use it.

**TLDR: PCG FCEL, SPWR, CWEN, TPIC** calls, **PLUG** puts but it‚Äôs probably gonna have a little dead kitten action after its dump since the first one of these DDs

2021-04-08 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Why PSFE is a GREATLY undervalued and overlooked stock. 3X candidate according to analyst Steve Grasso. **Introduction to Paysafe (PSFE):**

Paysafe Limited is a digital commerce company. Paysafe has its users in more than 120 countries across the United States, Canada and Europe to conduct commerce across online, mobile, in-application and in-store channels. The Company is focuses on iGaming, including online betting related to sports, esports, fantasy sports, poker and other casino games and Emerging Markets, which includes stock, FX and trading, direct marketing, which can include nutraceuticals and multi-level marketing, travel and entertainment, integrated payments and digital goods.

&#x200B;

**Quick and easy:**

Paysafe is a fin-tech company that just got out of a SPAC-merger, which immediately reeks given the recent SPAC-hype but HEAR ME OUT.

&#x200B;

**Why did they go public via SPAC?**

These days a lot of companies go public via SPACs. In PSFE‚Äôs case, already a big established company, this has allowed them to go a little under the radar. The only reason they went public via SPAC is because of a $9B agreement with Bill Foley to go public through Trasimene Acquisition Corp. II (BFT). This saved them from the bureaucratic process of going public through an IPO.

&#x200B;

**If they‚Äôd do an IPO, they would be a lot more covered by mainstream media and a conservative average for their IPO would probably be closer to $48.45.**

&#x200B;

**Here are EV/Revenue ratios of comparable companies, and PSFE equivalent at current levels:**

‚ÅÉ PayPal : 12.8x - 16x (based on PT) >>> PSFE: $26.67 - $33.33

‚ÅÉ Repay : 13.75x -> PSFE: $28.65

‚ÅÉ Affirm: 32.2x -> PSFE: $67.08

‚ÅÉ Nuvei : 40x -> PSFE: $83.33

‚ÅÉ Adyen : 18.6x -> PSFE: $38.75

‚ÅÉ Square : 11.2x -> PSFE: $23.33

‚ÅÉ Shift 4 : 11x -> PSFE: $22.91

‚ÅÉ [Bill.com](https://bill.com/) : 84x -> PSFE: $175

‚ÅÉ Stripe : 52.8x -> PSFE: $110

‚ÅÉ Chime : 50x -> PSFE: $104

‚ÅÉ Checkout : 150x -> PSFE: $312

Average (excluding outlier Checkout): $75.54

Conservative Average (excluding all above $100): $48.45

&#x200B;

Meanwhile, most of these companies have negative earnings and smaller margins than Paysafe.

Also, PayPal and SQ doesn‚Äôt have the risk assessment that Paysafe has got. Paysafe is one of the biggest payment providers in EU with their Paysafecards and online payment solutions, it is essentially an anonymous payment solution that anyone can use. This is BIG, especially in gambling. But also for kids that just want to go to the shop, buy a Paysafecard and redeem it for Fortnite skins. Paysafe has got a moat.

Paysafe is one of the most prominent payment providers in the booming iGaming industry. I can‚Äôt see how this is not a no-brainer at this price.

MM is pegging this at 14 maybe just until April 16th or more months for max pain to both call and put holders.

2021-04-07 21:01:07,wallstreetbets,"I don't think SQ and PYPL have a chance to compete with Paysafe in the iGaming sector. Because the thing is, Paysafe is anonymous and that's one of the reasons a lot of gamblers use it. It's easy to move your money around and also cash out. Paysafe does need some more traction in the US, cause right now its super popular in EU

2021-04-08 01:51:22,wallstreetbets,"Upvoting this higher. This is the reason. PSFE is definitely a good company, but I think most experienced investors have been burned huge by SPAC insiders and PIPEs selling off as soon as they can and are waiting to buy in until after share lockup expiry.

2021-04-08 02:15:44,wallstreetbets,"Like I said, Paysafe is not just another SPAC. It‚Äôs one of the biggest pay card providers in EU and one of most prominent online payment providers.

2021-04-08 13:21:05,wallstreetbets,"PIPE has a 6 month lock up.  Both PIPE and Blackstone have indicated no interest in selling. 

Eli Nagler, a Senior Managing  Director at Blackstone, just said: ‚ÄúWe believe Paysafe has a long runway  for further growth and look forward to remaining part of the team and  seeing their continued success as a public company.‚Äù

Regarding  Blackstone and CVC, who now have four senior managing directors on  Paysafe‚Äôs Board, Foley said, ‚ÄúThey rolled a significant amount of their  investment which is a confidence builder. They didn‚Äôt take all their  money off the table‚Ä¶ All of these things put together really created the  confidence among the investor base to invest in the PIPE and then  support the stock.‚Äù

PIPE lockup  ending in 6 months is even less of a concern.

2021-04-07 22:33:26,wallstreetbets,"Reminds me of when I bought 1000 square shares at its ipo, they let their customers get in on it. Which I am.  Love the company. Got it for $9 a share.

Thought I was the smartest man in the world when I sold for $13 a share. 

My very first investment ever."

2021-04-07 20:44:57,wallstreetbets,"Actually I'm pretty dumb on that score as well.
  
But I think if they were to theoretically merge, there's a ratio equation so like let's say PSFE hits 250 and AMZN is still 3k share price and they buy PSFE.
  
Pretty sure PSFE shares go up to whatever ration is agreed upon by the two companies. 
  
But like I said I'm also pretty dumb I have like 7 VIAC calls and no idea why I bought them ."

2021-04-07 20:48:33,wallstreetbets,"Like alot of people are saying, its hard to keep gains going.  Its never a bad idea to invest in yourself (like begin to start a small business etc.)  And if you start to lose, don't stay in bad positions.  You don't have to make your money back the same way you lose it. 
 If you continue, be calculated and don't count on multiple lucky breaks in a row."
2021-04-08 07:36:12,wallstreetbets,Crushing it my dude. Keep your head up don‚Äôt let these clowns talk down on you.

2021-04-07 22:38:32,wallstreetbets,I've felt like my BAC was a 4.0 many a time.
2021-04-08 02:51:33,wallstreetbets,If it's a short-term gain then it'd be taxed as income. Think you have to be under $12k income to owe no federal income taxes.
2021-04-07 21:49:03,wallstreetbets,They wouldn't let me open an account but I still wanted to be one of the cool kids

2021-04-08 03:26:26,wallstreetbets,Dawwwwww ... but I'm really way more of an autist ;)
2021-04-08 09:59:44,wallstreetbets,"It was mostly from losing my job about a week before, to keep your health insurance you pay out of pocket for something called COBRA which is very expensive. And fertility preserving treatments are not covered by insurance at all, that was the most expensive. The medical treatments were all covered. Cost me about $200 copay for 2 surgeries and $45 for each of my 4 rounds of chemotherapy which is not bad. The fertility treatments even with the grants I qualified for were about $10,000 each."
2021-04-07 22:00:21,wallstreetbets,"I outta do this more, usually I get stoaked, take a screenie to send to the fellas, then it tanks."
2021-04-08 02:00:32,wallstreetbets,"Well you're in the money, lol.

My dad hit me up about QS and told me to place a buy order for a just OTM $42 4/16 call like 2 days before it shot up 6 bucks... My only problem is he's retarded and told me to set the bid to something like .42 on a call that had a mark at .82. I should've just bought the call lol... Damnit, dad your advice is good and bad."
2021-04-08 11:34:39,wallstreetbets,Nope 40. I am an actual walking cloud of rum.
2021-04-08 03:40:31,wallstreetbets,"True, short term you always pay, long term capital gains you get the discount if you are lower income"
2021-04-08 08:05:14,wallstreetbets,Hence life savings.  üëç
2021-04-07 20:04:32,wallstreetbets,"But a life savings implies you saved for a full lifetime to achieve it. Tossing everything you have into a play is ballsy, no matter the amount. 

But saving for 5 years and saving for 40 just isn‚Äôt the same at all."
2021-04-07 20:14:40,wallstreetbets,"Eh. Words have meanings. I‚Äôm not demanding the risk he took. But if you‚Äôve been saving for five minutes it‚Äôs not the same as so so who lived and saved for a whole career. Call it something else, like ‚Äúall the money I have.‚Äù"
2021-04-08 10:13:07,wallstreetbets,"I'm not sure if those treatments would be covered here either to be honest, but I do know everyone has to have health insurance, which costs you about 100 euros per month and is compensated by the government if you are below a certain income threshold, so you never need to worry about it. Even without a job you will never go in debt because you got sick."
2021-04-07 20:35:10,wallstreetbets,Or even just buy SPY if you want to have more exposure. Just stop risking ‚Äúyour entire life savings‚Äù on something that may have a 50% chance of going tits up.
2021-04-08 09:19:01,wallstreetbets,"This isn't even an exaggeration, lmao."
2021-04-07 20:16:40,wallstreetbets,I see your point
2021-04-08 10:14:24,wallstreetbets,"Considering most of the debt was from treatments that wouldn't have been covered there, I'd venture a guess people do"
2021-04-07 20:38:28,wallstreetbets,I appreciate that. Thanks.
2021-04-08 10:27:00,wallstreetbets,"Typically things that cause physical or mental distress are covered, when things that are aesthetical are not. For example breast implants are not covered, unless they're reconstructive after breast removal surgery because missing a breast may cause psychological trouble. Breast reduction surgery is typically covered if you suffer from back trouble because of the size of your breasts, but if you simply don't like the look of it it's not.

I'd expect infertility to be covered under mental distress, but I haven't heard of any such cases, so I couldn't say for sure."
2021-04-08 10:52:28,wallstreetbets,"That's the same as here except our insurance is private. Fertility preservation treatments are a private treatment. Extracting, freezing, and storing eggs is not covered, but there are subsidies from the Livestrong Foundation as an example."

2021-04-08 00:16:39,wallstreetbets,"Depends on if he's pulling from 401 or getting a loan out of his 401. Loans aren't bad at all if used properly because they have to be paid back in over time without interest, good way to spread big payments out without getting hit with 10% early withdrawal fee. In the worst case you pay yourself back with interest over time so you end up with more than you started. Well, real worst case is you're an idiot and blow it all without achieving any financial goals so now you're further in debt with more coming out monthly."
2021-04-07 21:46:31,wallstreetbets,Truth. I know numerous people who have done this.  They are worse off after borrowing from the 401k to pay off CC debt.

I lived on a wood floor for 6 months before losing my apartment in Portland, I couldn‚Äôt even afford a mattress.

People acting like my spending habits were eating my income up are so full of shit its infuriating. The only expense I could ‚Äúcut‚Äù was cellphone, or utilities (water/electric/gas), and good luck finding or holding a job with no method of communication, and good luck keeping roomies when you refuse to pay for utilities."

The point is 200-250 a month will get you to 10k, whether it takes 2, 3, or 4 years doesn‚Äôt really matter long term.

People act like it‚Äôs impossible to save that amount of money, but pretty much everyone I know can cut their weekly spending by $49.  It‚Äôs one thing if you are firmly in real poverty territory, but most people I know could stop eating out, drink no or only cheap instant coffee, quit going to bars, downgrade their internet speed, switch to a budget cell plan, quit buying new smartphones on financed upgrade plans, quit buying video games, trade their car in for a much cheaper model, etc."

The play isn't short-term, it's to buy long-term calls and sell calls at your PT, for premium (however big/small it is). Big boys will wear you short term guys out and eat away at it till people get tired and give up.  THEN, they'll drive it up.  


The play is to keep a PT of $60-70, catalyst move up much faster is news of high growth of subscriber count and/or great earnings."

They're not a get rich quick scheme but the halfway well-run ones will do really, really well in the long-term. According to Warren Buffet, one of the hardest parts of investing is being PATIENT. 

Recently read that the average woman earns 2%-3% more per investing then men, because on average they only make 9 trades a year instead of the 12 the average man makes a year. Fuck, Uncle Warren might be onto something here. 

TAKE A DEEP BREATH.

2021-04-08 09:41:26,wallstreetbets,"For what it is worth - because it can be considered early in terms of IVY (not this guys thinking since they have been at it for over 2 years with AWS), and some other initiatives that have yet to have the numbers roll in, there is a level of subjectivity involved when deciding the valuation of BB. When a parachuter jumps out of a plane we know they will hit the ground and we even have a broad and general idea as to the vicinity of where. BUT thus far pretty much all financial analysts are being largely gutless and not taking any strong view - typical of most IBs. If / when one ever does make a clear and strong buy call, the shares will likey be twice or more the current level. Happens all the times. Bankers are extremely conservative. Nevertheless apes don't have to actually see the parchuter hit the ground to know they will. Sure there are a wide range of possibilties as to how subtsantial IVY may become but at these levels nothing is being priced in (just about getting it for free) and when considering all the upside BB has and the limited downside (trading at 10% of some peers and the largest shareholder - PW - has a cost base of approximately $14 US on about $1 billion of exposure), the current level is a steal (despite what the naysayers try to suggest). The shares hit $28.77 US in January. Even though that was probably much quicker than what any bull might have expected, it was a sign that the shares want to go there and higher. No question it gets there again and higher. Would not be surprised to see it above $25 US within less than 6 months."

2021-04-08 14:11:51,wallstreetbets,I did the numbers way back in relative detail. I did have to rely on one or two news articles but they were credible (Globe and Mail or Wall St Journal). Some of his purchases were $18 or higher. His lowest is $6 US (convertible ). How did you get Canadian?  Not impossible I am off slightly BUT the point is that he is approximately at breakeven now and no one (in particular of his experience) would allocate this size of money for a measly or average return after 10 years (same applies to Chen who is already very wealthy and came out of retirement).  I suspect they have been aiming for the $50-$100 USD range if not higher. IVY could drive things there and beyond. How did you get Canadian?  Thanks.

Actual communication latency on a cellular networks is generally not fixed.  Networks are time and frequency multiplexed.  Time multiplexed means you have to wait until the time slot specified by the network to communicate which makes latency less than consistent.  That is assuming a good clean channel with no retries."

2021-04-08 12:02:04,wallstreetbets,"Feels like you are really good at this tech. subject. Active time slot versus passive package delivery, how do you look at them?"
2021-04-08 13:30:59,wallstreetbets,"This is one of my go to references for LTE specifically.  [https://www.sqimway.com/lte\_resource\_grid.html](https://www.sqimway.com/lte_resource_grid.html)  


It shows you the resource break up of a single frame which is 10 ms.  Each of those blocks is a single moment in time and frequency that cellular devices in the area share between them.  A device is required to transmit at a specific moment in time AT THE TOWER.  That means that the device must account for travel time so that the message arrives at the tower during the correct time frame.  Timing advance is how this happens.  Normally, a device may have to send several messages to get into sync with the tower, but if the device has not moved, it can use the previous timing advance and save potentially seconds of time in connecting to the network.  Once the device is connected, it will send during its allocated time/frequency slots.  The device gets a certain number per 10 ms frame, so latency is also dependent on payload size, but you can expect the device to send the payload in a certain number of frames.  The only gotcha is network load and signal strength.  If there are a lot of devices sharing the network nearby, you may get a smaller set of bandwidth allocated.  If you are in a place with bad signal, the message may have to be resent several times.  PHY level resend is generally pretty quick, but each attempt adds latency, and since it is not consistent, the latency is variable based on signal quality.

UDP vs TCP is probably a bigger issue with latency.  With TCP, the stack is using certified delivery.  If a message is not acknowledged, it is resent until it succeeds or times out.  The upper end time out is dynamic based on typical response times, but it can be in minutes.  Where it becomes a problem is in the actual TCP stack.  Most TCP stacks delay all messages on a socket until the missing message arrives.  So if you have a constant stream of traffic, TCP will pause the traffic intermittantly based on connection quality.  UDP doesn't have retries, so it typically has a pretty consistent latency, but it has the problem of missing the message entirely.  So depending on connection quality, UDP will periodically drop messages.  Most time sensitive automation uses UDP, then adds extra protocol on top to allow the system to deal with occasional missing packets.

On top of that, all TCP traffic moves in hops, and the latency of hops is depends on how much traffic the router is under.  The main reason I bring this up, is that typically, the latency of TCP/UDP is a bigger issue than the latency of the underlying layers, and most LTE devices use some form of TCP on top of then network layer.  You you could be cruising along at a nice stable latency, then someone decides to start downloading pr0n through one of the routers your application is using, and suddenly your latency spikes.  This is the main reason why dedicated networks are often used in control applications.

Finally, to answer you question more directly, I don't.  In all of the control work I have done, TCP latency, network load, and similar issues have always been a much bigger latency issues than active vs passive delivery.  The closest I have come is passive devices in ZigBee.  There you treat active as instant.  For passive messages, you need to know the poll rate.  The latency of passive delivery is an average of half the poll rate with a uniform error distribution of +/- half the poll rate."

If wages stagnated why did i make over twice as much as him out of school about 15-20 years later?  Can you explain that?

But that's irrelevant, because even if that was an accurate characterization, it doesn't matter - success at one firm in one type of business does not somehow translate into guaranteed success at a different firm in a different business.  

If it did, then no corporation would ever fail - they would all have the same dozen directors on their boards and they would all have never-ending success as a result.

2021-04-08 03:35:41,wallstreetbets,"‚Äú‚ÄúThere is nobody coming to save us. This is the only certainty. All we have is each other.

DFV caught them sleeping, he found deep value in this targeted stock, he saw what others could not.

But those days of singular advantage are over.  Now the multi eyed watcher is awake and watching everything we say and they know our moves down to the date.   DFV can't save us he can just encourage us along the way to seek our piece of the action, but he's been silenced, muted and is being monitored by big brother.  This is the reality, it's why he has to communicate to us in cryptic tweets.  Nobody can argue that, that's a fact of our day to day here.

The SEC isn't coming to save us.  Know what they're doing? Watching DFV and hoping for a sweet gig at these big funds in their endless revolving door they're always in trouble for.  Yeah, let that soak in.

The FBI isn't coming to save us.  They have a securities fraud hotline and a white collar crime entity within the bureau but you can bet your sweet hairy monkey ass they are also just looking at DFV and retail with those powers.  And also they are busy right now with other things taking their attention.

The Media sure as all hell isn't coming to save us.  Anne Dias (formerly Anne Dias Griffin) is Kenny G's ex wife and she sits high up on the board of advisors for Newscorp.  Yup, WSJ, Barron's, Marketwatch and the provider of market ""news"" for CNBC, Newscorp.  This is a big club and we are not in it as the great Sage Carlin remarked.  They actively hate us and seek our destruction because we are THE threat to their status quo establishment aristocracy.  They are not coming to help.  The revolution will not be televised.

The Government is not coming to save us.  Did you watch the hearings? We're they a joke? Yeah they sure were.  They're actively seeking ways to remove ""confetti"" from the ""gamification"" of online trading that's about it.  Yup, totally out of touch as to be expected.   And I'm sure they've long since moved on from this as they rotate out to whatever flavor of the day is.

Whales, well whales are mysterious deep water entities aren't they who can say why they move in the ways they do so I'll leave that one up to ""who friggin knows.""  Because I sure don't know any whales personally.

So where does that leave us? Who is coming to save us then?

Nobody is!  Because nobody needs to!  Plot twist.  ***We aren't the ones that need saving.***  It's all of the above.  We aren't the ones that need to be afraid here.

It's us who are coming for them, to get what is ours.

2021-04-08 09:35:53,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm expecting us to hit resistance at the 285 price point. GameStop can sell 3.5 million shares for no more than 1 billion. That would come out to 285 a share. That is if they sell all the shares they want. But it would also be smarter for them to wait for the price point to skyrocket to dump shares so they keep more shares but still hit 1 billion. What I‚Äôm hoping for is them selling at the very top and then catching the ride down. If they do it this way them unloading these shares would give us the MOAD (mother of all dips) so we can all reposition after we sell at the top we can buy at this discount and reposition ourselves to go long on gme. Turn that 20x return into a 100x return. I‚Äôll just add it‚Äôll be better for them to sell on the way down because it‚Äôll drive the price down so us retard apes can buy more stock after the moaas to maintain a higher share price.

## Chairman Vs. CEO

The CEO effectively can be said to be running the company and is usually seen as the top person within the company. However, this power and status derives from the way the CEO role is carried out. The chairman holds superiority to the CEO. As well as having the right to overrule the CEO on major issues, the chairman ‚Äì along with the rest of the board ‚Äì makes the decision to hire or fire a CEO."

2021-04-07 20:38:40,wallstreetbets,Yeah but how much of the population is vaccinated?  Seems like we‚Äôd be jumping the gun a bit...  right when we‚Äôre getting it under control.
2021-04-07 21:08:37,wallstreetbets,"I know it sucks, but once you guys get control of the virus you can start easing off, it's happening rn in Israel and the cases are dropping.

You get the vaccine so you're chances of it developing in your body are wayyy smaller, and so are your chances of passing it, but the main reason is so you don't get fucked by the disease, the longer the time passes we are figuring out more and more, and understanding the long term implications of having it.

Even if you are young and healthy and don't die from it, we are seeing evidence that it can wreck your body long term - your lungs can operate at a lesser capacity, you can have heart problems, brain problems, etc, we see examples of young athletes that can never compete again becuase they are getting wiped out from going up the stairs, people developing anxiety and mental disorders, regular healthy people are having serious long term effects from this.

The vaccine reduces immensely the severity of the disease itself, which in turn reduces the long term implications, reduces your chances of catching and passing it. It should be taken to protect yourself first and foremost, even if you are a healthy young person.

Things will get better, as long as we don't act stupid."

# FAQ

## What does this mean?

The amount of karma (points) on your comment and Reddit account has decreased by one.

## Why did you do this?

There are several reasons I may deem a comment to be unworthy of positive or neutral karma. These include, but are not limited to:

* Rudeness towards other Redditors,
* Spreading incorrect information,
* Sarcasm not correctly flagged with a `/s`.

## Am I banned from the Reddit?

No - not yet. But you should refrain from making comments like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.

## I don't believe my comment deserved a downvote. Can you un-downvote it?

Sure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a downvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.

## How can I prevent this from happening in the future?

Accept the downvote and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on Reddit.com. I will continue to issue downvotes until you improve your conduct. Remember: Reddit is privilege, not a right."

2021-04-07 21:04:41,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs not illegal, maybe. It is, however, dishonest.

The bank sold stock to its clients with the specific purpose to leave them holding the bag.
It withheld information from the clients (that it was going to sell a lot more stock the next day, causing its price to plummet) that it knew would have made them refuse the deal.

There is a lesson here for small investors too: when your investment advisor is suggesting you some product, he/she usually doesn‚Äôt have your profit in mind. What they care for is their own commission and bonuses, and helping the bank selling its most remunerative products or unload assets it finds undesirable.

And the complex products they peddle, guaranteeing something-or-the-other, capped losses, great past performance, etc? They are studied and built to help the bank profit safely and the client shoulder the investment risk.

I have direct experience with a few advisors from different banks and heard similar stories from others, and want to stress: don‚Äôt trust bank advisors, their are salesman with an agenda. They devote more time to preparing sales pitches than doing market research."

After Clinton the restrictions were effectively dead. Then Bush and congress both pushed for more lending for banks to prevent a 2002 minor crash. Then they forced banks to give large loans on the condition that they loan them out and they just loaned them out to risky people.

2008 was basically caused by the government trying to control the economy instead of letting it naturally flow. Everything the government touches explodes."
2021-04-08 08:00:14,wallstreetbets,"Because the fed set it up so that if those banks fail the entire monetary system collapses. No joke...

It was a shit idea so of course the bear defaults and loses the bear cave.

2021-04-08 19:13:37,wallstreetbets,"Big newb here but we‚Äôre all on a journey together; these are my thoughts;

I‚Äôve lost big every time I got greedy. If you feel yourself doing it, get out.

Another thing is when a meme stock pops up, that‚Äôll move maybe 5% before it becomes unpredictable. Don‚Äôt buy in if it‚Äôs already up that 5% for the day, unless you *actually* believe in it.

Most stocks feel arbitrarily priced, but the fact is if it‚Äôs a company you like, other people like it too and the price is likely *already* high as a result. Don‚Äôt just buy TSLA because you want a tesla. Look at where the *stock price* is going. See if it‚Äôs under or over priced. And think about what their next big event (positive or negative) is most likely to be.

I‚Äôve stopped buying calls; you‚Äôll lose money, and the opportunity to over leverage yourself just means going broke that much faster when they all expire worthless. Look at the loss porn from options buyers if you need a reminder. 

Selling options is good, though; it lets you reduce losses downwards, profit sideways, *and* gives you an exit point in the positive direction that isn‚Äôt too greedy (recall, greed = losing big). It‚Äôs increasingly effective at higher IVs, and Theta is your friend; both of which are very nice qualities in a trade.

Another good technique is to make sure your graphs are candlesticks. They provide 4x the information, so you‚Äôll be more able to see patterns in the stock prices. Identify trends which indicate the price is accelerating/decelerating and use *those* to determine your entry and exit points, rather than just if it‚Äôs red/green for the moment/day/since open.

Just remember that small wins will compound, while big losses will wipe you out."

2021-04-08 11:36:42,wallstreetbets,"I'm encouraged by that as well even though they did that by diluting my shares. Total debt to capital is still above 60%. 

If the trend continues, they'll get a good balance sheet. Right now it's okay. Overall it's still my favorite current stock.

I actually love Academy. I can't stand Dick's, and Academy will take over. Academy squeezes far more products into a square foot, and they are less expensive. Amazon will cut in, but you can't stop with the family before a camping trip and feel the fishing equipment, try on gear, and buy worms at Amazon. There's a moat around Academy that the ""death of brick and mortar"" futurists can't see. I would have gladly bought in at the IPO if it was on my radar.

The short interest and a pile on by wallstreetbets retards is icing on the cake."

I mean think about it. MMs got caught with their pants down on the initial run and other hedges got involved and took massive calls to drive value up, this is why option IVs went through the roof. I should know because i converted 6k into 150k in that week. We were up at 480 bro, and they dropped it to 100 in less than an hour. If you think trillion dollar funds are going to just ‚Äúlet you‚Äù do anything you are out of your mind. We are going to have small bursts of movement, because if I was on the wrong side of the trade and have billions in capital, i would wait it out until economy resumes and all the stimulus cheques and all the government assistance stops, or your banks come calling for the loans people took out, or parents have to bills. People are going to take gains, losses, whatever because life. DFV has 13 million in fking cash man, and thats just his GME account. How do you know he has no other accounts? He is done for life, he can wait out this play as long as he wants too. The rest of you ‚Äúapes‚Äù cant, and that is the reality. All these people talking about diamond hands, big LOL. They are just praying we can get back to 480 because they either bough really high, or they dont want to admit defeat. Everyone is in this game to make a buck and get rich, this kumbaya lets all hold hands BS is for little boys and girls. Here is the reality, no one in this subreddit gives two fks about you or your problems or your life, when you need to pay your bills and all your funds are tied in GME none of these dudes are coming to help. Believe that. It may sound harsh but this is the reality. Some people who are in their early twenties are about to cripple themselves for life due to massive debt. This is not something to meme about. This is real life and alot of people are going to get royally fucked. I hope it moons, I hope you guys get to 10k or whatever the new number is I really do because I already made my money and my lights will remain on and ill be able to put food on the table, I hope thats true for the rest of you guys too.

P.S. DFV bought $12 strike options for $4 a pop, he doesnt need this stock to do shit. He is exercising those calls and getting 50,000 shares for 600k. I dont know why people are expecting fireworks on April 16th."
2021-04-07 20:52:09,wallstreetbets,This year only. My bad I should have made that clear originally. Either way right now I‚Äôm SO EXTREMELY FUCKING BULLISH on GME. I‚Äôm feeling it. I‚Äôve got a good feeling about tomorrow. And I have a great feeling this things gonna kick off by next week. Though this is 100% just my opinion and bias.

Thursday April 8th:  


Premarket: Futures ripping- may see a push higher on SPY.  


TSLA levels I'm watching are $660 for support, $690/$700 resistance. If we get past $700 then next resistance is $720.  


Papa Musk tweeted in the wee morning thanking his suppliers. BULLISH. Think what you will but if you study Elons tweets, that man sending cryptic messages left and right. You're a retard if you think tweets don't move stonks!  


My plan: Looking for $690+ to derisk my current position. End of week? Very cautious but very optimistic. If we can stay above 690/700 then the battle continues next week.

2021-04-08 03:15:15,wallstreetbets,">One quick word on the cybersecurity part of the business: BB and CRWD have roughly the same yearly revenue (I will leave it to the experts to discuss how comparable they are). One company has $5bn market cap and the other $44bn.

Regarding this statement, the revenue from BB is collective from many other products and services where as from CRWD it's from Cyber division itself. That's the fact, that we can't shy away. If the revenue from BB from the Cyber sector was same as CRWD then it the market cap justification will come into picture.  


If people don't like my comment, check the DD that I have written for BB where it backs my comment. That been said, BB has to knock off more in the revenue this year in Cyber space since the Cylance is full integrated with Spark product."
2021-04-07 22:09:27,wallstreetbets,Canada would front the loan at 0% interest.
2021-04-08 17:04:16,wallstreetbets,"I seem to have been downvoted a lot for this. but i'll make it simple. they hold patents that have a YRR(yearly return revenue), think of it like a second house that is rented out with a nice yearly extra income. selling that income for 2-3x the yearly income gives you extra money to invest now, but decreases your balance and your future income.

Longterm good would be holding the patents and using that money to grow and if you need more take out a loan or make some more shares.

Shortterm this means better earnings and less debt this year, but less income and profits for longterm"

2021-04-07 21:36:18,wallstreetbets,">Fair enough that you wouldn't trust a closed system to not have a backdoor but would you trust an open source system more?

Given that it was a poor analogy, it doesn't really matter regarding the main topic of discussion, but yes, depending on who's contributed to the project. I'm obviously sus on federal partnerships with some of the biggest commercial players in the opensource/libre scene.

The real question is ""how much trust?""

And it's significantly more when the system as a whole is set up properly to limit those potential 0days.

Try installing a firewall worth a shit in your Tesla, you know?

So on the topic of home security, most of the affordable options now are IoT devices with single point of failure on the data storage side and .. well.. direct internet exposure. Which you don't really want in every single cam in the house.

Good luck ""firewalling"" those in a meaningful way too, they're designed to talk internet and aren't useful without that access.

Etc etc. Tldr it's complicated but I know how deeply backdoored almost every consumer platform is at a firmware level, integrated radios and IP layer access, including all the SoCs I build on.

And now Hacking Team released all the tools to fuck with this stuff. NSA contractor level tools just floating around.

So uhhh. Tbh I guess it doesn't matter to the consumer whether they use a closed (security by obscurity) system or an open one. People choose based on convenience etc, and even if you geek out hard you can still get owned.

But tl;dr I have a higher level of trust in libre/open software than proprietary every time. I'll build my own damn car. Again. Lul."

2021-04-07 20:45:15,wallstreetbets,This is do nice and well explained. The problem is I have doubt in the facts he reported because buying 1 call GM was already $280 few months ago. How did he manage to buy 25 contracts for only $1500?????? Am I missing something here?
2021-04-07 21:28:25,wallstreetbets,"He bought the LEAPS when GM was around 20$ back in March or April of 2020. This means at that time, the strike of 40 was 100% OTM- which is normal for .6 premium for 2 years out. 

GM just had insanely good year and did 200%. So yes, he did buy 25 contracts for 1500 as .6 x 25 x 100= 1500$

So he has been holding these for almost a year now. 

PS. Usually, and I mean 99.9999999% of the time, screen shot of Robinhood or webull is truthful. This is because the interface is clearly taken from a screen shot of an phone and that can only be manipulated using photoshop (while desktop SS can be HTML etc). 

But of course using photoshop for this is BEYOND the scope of the people in this sub and frankly kind retarded to waste hour doing it for this amount of attention."

It was the smart play to short it when it was up at that level. There was a very strong chance it would drop, at least a little, after that pop. Rarely do we see things move vertical continuously. I'm willing to bet this short positon will be closed very shortly...it's likely a (very) short term play. Stock will bounce back."

2021-04-07 23:39:21,wallstreetbets,"GME peaks are irrelevant and don't help with the short squeeze. So even if options didn't slow down the process for the short squeeze, it in no way helps it, so therefore it would help if people just stopped buying options but instead bought shares and held."
2021-04-08 01:31:31,wallstreetbets,"Lol you shoved a crayon too far up your nose. Itm options force mm to hedge there calls. They hedge those calls by buying shares. Buying shares causes the price to go up. Price going up puts pressure on shorts to cover our get margin called. Without options we don't have the volume to move the price. HFs can create synthetic longs, short the top down and buy the bottom over and over. Low volume=volatility, and that's where HFs and MMs make money. Weekly 800c don't help anyone the squeeze. ITM calls are what is going to cause the price Spike that will force the clearing houses to call margin on over leveraged shorts."

Should have waited one more day, oh well.  Im in this for short and long term.  Overall they are slowly expanding across the south and have had sustained growth.  

The biggest shock was earnings wasn't even driven by gun sales!  It was by foot wear and apparel.  I think since they sell guns they are a solid buy and hold.  I'm hoping for a short term swing up in the next few weeks, but I really am bullish on ASO."

2021-04-07 20:58:55,wallstreetbets,See this is what I‚Äôm talking about. You don‚Äôt even understand how deferred taxes work. Deferred tax liabilities are not the same as tax payables.
2021-04-08 09:33:05,wallstreetbets,"So let me get this straight-- when they list -$138m on their balance sheet as net deferred tax liabilities, you think ""Ahhh, we can just zero that out no biggie.""  

That's not how it works.  That $138m is gonna show up as a tax bill in the future.  You can quibble about whether they owe it today or tomorrow, but they owe it.  How are they gonna pay it if you're using their cash on getting square with the suppliers?

Same with replenishing inventory.  Same with paying your other accrued expenses and liabilities.  You can't just ignore these."
2021-04-08 09:55:16,wallstreetbets,"DTA/DTL‚Äôs are book to tax differences. That‚Äôs it. It‚Äôs the difference between the value of the assets on the accounting books and the tax basis of the assets on the tax books.

So no, they don‚Äôt owe the full $138M in cash tomorrow and they don‚Äôt owe full $138M in cash next year. Shit, they don‚Äôt owe the full $138M two years from now. The DTL will wind down over a period years.

Why you are expecting them to have enough cash on hand to satisfy every liability, current or non-current, is beyond me. Go learn how deferred taxes work before you come here talking about how they need to use current cash on hand to satisfy non current liabilities.

Like why go through all the work of looking through the financials just to bash it on an Internet forum. If you don‚Äôt like the company, then don‚Äôt buy the stock or, better yet, short it. It‚Äôs that simple."
2021-04-07 21:47:50,wallstreetbets,"thing is the tax deadline is now may 15th, so people are still cashing out stocks for a bit to pay off the big man."

So you can see some places in which they will not report until 45 days after the trade because their broker will not report it to them immediately.

2021-04-07 20:08:11,wallstreetbets,"It reallyyy fucks old people up. And spreads like wildfire in nursing homes/hospitals. Its a serious disease for specifically that population. Their survival rate is likely much lower proportionally 

I work in a nursing home and it does have way more severe side effects than any other viral disease I've ever seen. Not just acutely, but the % of people who had covid even months ago and leave on oxygen that they never had before is very high. That almost never happens with the flu or any viral/bacteria infection. But again, old people. Seems to have something to do with some checks and balances on our immune systems that lessen as you get older. There is like this cascading overreaction from our immune system to the stubborn covid virus and its almost like our own immune system ends up hurting/harming/killing the body, not even covid itself.

Anywayyyyy, yea you can't compare it to polio or smallpox or whatever. Overall, my opinion is that it is HIGHLY infectious and very harmful to the elderly; and its just a semi-bad flu to younger people. But the infectivity again is SKY HIGH, it spreads so incredibly rapidly. Which is probably the main reason why the shut downs and need for immediate response, in whatever manner that would be. That's what I've seen, that's the data I've seen, and its my opinion. Of which, I'll never state as fact."
2021-04-07 20:15:52,wallstreetbets,"Yeah it does. I encouraged my grandmas to get the vaccine cause they need it and unknown long term effects from the first ever RNA vaccine used on people don‚Äôt play a role for them. For me, they play a role and I‚Äôm not getting the shot for a few years if ever. I‚Äôm waiting for normal FDA approval (not emergency approval) and trials to end in the next year or so. 

But covid especially fucks up old people when you put covid positive people in with old ppl in nursing homes. Like they did in california and New York. Pretty sure the flu always gets lots of old people. But usually the governors don‚Äôt put people who have the flu in the same spot as old people. But I mean it was a means to an end.

* A solid month or two of questions where the guy _clearly_ didn't get basic options concepts, or learn

* The entire event, which is comedy masterpiece, including people discussing his taxes and being told ""yeahhhhh he won't end up needing to pay taxes in the long run""
* Two lone posts after the happy little accident, years later. One about paying taxes where ""a friend"" lost 80k in 2017 but made 100k in 2018. Then a complaint about a rescinded Uber tip to him 2 years later."

- The demand for nuclear energy is stagnating and it is very predictable how it will look like for the next ten years because there is a high entrance barrier to the market. In some countries building a power plant takes up to 20 years of planning. The world nuclear association foresees a growth of demand of 26% until 2030.

Still I would happily be proven that it's a good investment, maybe with more sources about what's going on in Asia and Russia and how far the technology and building time of reactors has advanced. So if you have more info, please share :)"

2021-04-08 08:15:11,wallstreetbets,"Interesting take Macab, though the source you‚Äôve referenced is from June 2020, which, compared with April 2021 data shows a very different picture as far as restricted supply now vs even just 9 months ago in June.

[U Supply April 2021](https://mobile.twitter.com/quakes99/status/1379873261748506625/photo/1)

Also, it doesn‚Äôt really matter for the current bull market whether new plants are coming online, how long they might take, etc. 

It‚Äôs really just a simple supply/demand story of a restricted supply now due to Covid and low U prices forcing mines out of production. Utilities have to re-negotiate at much higher prices to incentivize mines to do business. It‚Äôs inevitable the prices will rise.

Having started investing in Q3 of last year, pretty much all the equities I‚Äôve invested are up 100% or more. And this is really the tip of the iceberg. 

What investments are you looking at?"
2021-04-08 10:05:49,wallstreetbets,"If I understand correctly, you bet not on organic growth of mining companies but of them making more money on the same quantities available. That's a legit play to make, it's too risky right now to fit in my portfolio though. As mines are just temporary closed and demand is very well predictable, I am not sure if a big shortage will be created. 

I'm not having any hot stocks right now. I think Logitech could still be a play for a year or two. Also anything Biotech/oncology related could be interesting.

I do want to make an energy play though, just not sure if batteries, solar or uranium will be my choice."
2021-04-08 10:26:04,wallstreetbets,"Out of curiosity, what makes you think there is no U shortage? In particular, when you say the mines are ‚Äútemporarily closed,‚Äù this is true, but they won‚Äôt come online until the term contracting price for enriched uranium allows them to. If it doesn‚Äôt come up, the inventories will squeeze even more. So you can see the inevitability in all this. Something has to give...

Have you looked at all at the Uranium tickers? Not necessarily the better-known ones you might see memes on, but more so in the OTCs? Can‚Äôt speak about them bc they don‚Äôt meet the Cap requirements here, but there are some really interesting plays in there. You could mirror from the URNM ETF."

2021-04-08 16:22:18,wallstreetbets,"> If the company is expected to be bought, why would the stock run up and

It won't because it's complete speculation. You won't know unless you have insider info. If a leak happens then the price just jump up to the price of the reported buyout. No opportunity to get in unless you brought it before it leaks.

>why would a shareholder expect to receive a premium from the price negotiated with the acquirer

Why would you sell a company below market price or the current price. The deal still has to be approved by shareholders. Plus it's not like the lawyer expenses were cheap either nor is the time worth it to attend to these meetings.

> Why would they offer a premium 

Let me ask you this. If someone knocked on your door and offered to buy your house for example at market price or below it while also requiring you to fill out paper work. Would you sell the house? 

Besides shareholder approval, you also need to think of it from the executive/board perspective. Would they rather a) hire lawyers, attend tons of meetings, fill out tons of paper work, etc to sell below/current market price or b) fill out a few sheets of paper with the SEC to sell your stock."

2021-04-08 01:04:29,wallstreetbets,"Just to play devil's advocate (any good hypothesis should be able to stand up to scrutiny!)

ICLN has AUM of 5,541,126,900.

Looking at these proposed weights PCG is going from 0% (not on their current holdings) to 5% hypothetical. 250MM is getting injected into a 22.51B stock.

By the time we get to the bottom of their list sorted by weight they're injecting \~3.5MM into a 113MM stock.

The dream bull case for something like PCG with \~70% institutional ownership is if they go on the open market to acquire 250MM (\~22MM shares) from the \~600MM share retail pool. 

Obviously that's not cost efficient for an institutional investor and the days to cover such a transaction would be gigantic (1 month+).

I think by May 17th when the 13F and 13Gs get published, we see that insider + institutional ownership went UP since the previous 12/31 cutoff. This would mean that since the 'squeeze' and 'short covering' in January, MORE shares are owned by institutions, not less. Since they were already at 97 million shares owned as of 12/31, if we see that number tick up to 105m shares, that means statistically speaking, there are 35M shorted shares out there (at a minimum)."

When you back out the insider shares (RC ventures, et al) and ETFs, the float is much lower. Let's say between 25M and 40m shares. Using Ihor's 10M shorted shares, that's 10m/25 or 10m/40m.

Then you should also understand the most important basic point which is that PLTR cannot instantly duplicate their services to each and every account.  They need to customize, build a team account officers and staff. They'll need to modify, massage, filter each of their clients database differently. MSFT can duplicate their core OS once they finished writing code for it.  So can Facebook.  I'm simplifying here, but essentially this basic digital multipiicity enables scalability.  Scalabilty works with lithography on top of seminconductor. Scalability works on digital copy duplication with software, apps, gaming.  If you truly understand PLTR, it's likely you'll likely come to realization scalability doesn't really apply to them.  Too much customization, servicing is involved."

The part that may need to be built new is any data ingestion, but they also have ML in place to help with 90% of that. And then you need model tuning, which they have services team to help with and can move between engagements.

The NPI is in the data, but the archetype can be shared without the NPI piece providing a high amount of reuse. Their contracts likely specify that they keep the archetype, but not the NPI data ingestion.

This is all why contrarian investing demolishes wall street. Anyone that has worked in this line has wanted to build a tool like this, but having the funding to do so is pretty prohibitive. PLTR managed to leverage government funding to get to a point where the funding to grow wasn't prohibitively expensive.
