2021-05-04 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"🚀$NIO is a charging bull! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀👩‍🚀👨‍🚀 Last week, $NIO told investors that second quarter deliveries are expected to only be about 7% higher than the 20,060 it reported for the first quarter 2021. Back in March, NIO announced that chip supply issues would cause it to take a five-day outage that ran into several April production days.

NIO and its partner JAC Motor also kicked off construction of a new industrial park in collaboration with the city of Hefei on April 29. The park will include a new manufacturing facility to support future production growth. 

* ***NIO delivered 7,102 vehicles in April 2021, increasing by 125.1% year-over-year***
* ***Cumulative deliveries of the ES8, ES6 and EC6 as of April 30, 2021 reached 102,803***

# NIO and Elite Chinese University joins forces.

The two will establish the USTC-NIO Smart Electric Vehicle Joint Laboratory to conduct joint research on major national as well as local projects

Nio will provide resources and a platform to serve as an educational internship base for USTC, which in turn will support the establishment of a postdoctoral workstation at the joint lab.

USTC, part of the elite ""C9 League,"" a group of universities that is claimed to be the Chinese equivalent of the Ivy League by state-run newspaper People's Daily, is located in Hefei, Anhui Province. 

Hefei is also home to Nio China's headquarters and the JAC NIO facility, which rolled out the company’s 100,000th mass-produced vehicle in April. The university’s research strength in China is almost comparable to that of Tsinghua University and Peking University, as per the report.

2021-05-04 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"DD: $ASO - Lawyers, Guns, and Money If you have not heard the song *Lawyers, Guns, and Money* by Warren Zevon then you're not missing much, but it does loosely tie into my analysis of **Academy Sports + Outdoors**.

**Intro:** There's a chance you haven't heard of Academy Sports if you're not from the Southern United States- and that's ok. The business is simple, Academy Sports operates as a sporting goods and outdoor recreational products retailer, similarly to Dick's Sporting Goods, Bass Pro Shops, Cabela's, and Sportsman's Warehouse. In terms of business model, there's not much more to it than that, except for 1 key difference compared to Dick's and some other competitors; **Academy Sports sells guns and ammunition**. I'll be using some comparisons to these company's in the analysis below. 

**Notes:**

1. The reason I'm putting this write-up together today is because of recent action on behalf of the major shareholders. I will go more into detail on that below.
2. ASO was intially publicly offered at the beginning of October 2020. I typically stay away from IPOs in general, but took a look at the company and decided to do a deeper dive. 

**Metrics:** 

1. **ROIC**, as of today, is 12.48%. This has improved year over year since 2019(the company was private before this so financial statements only go back so far) and doubled from 2020 to 2021. While Sportsman's Warehouse has had double digit ROIC over the last few years as well, it's more sporadic and up or down with some negative returns mixed in quarterly as well. Dick's is the steadier of the 2 comparisons maintaining that ~10% ROIC over the last few years(GuruFocus).
2. **D/E ratio** is currently at about .71. The good news, however, is that because ASO exists largely in the Southern United States, they did not bleed as much during the Lockdown Era. Depending upon the state, stores were kept open and selling while competitors had to close their doors and take on more leverage to survive. This is reflected further in ASO's financial statements showing that virtually all of their existing debt is long term. Their current cash position outweighs their short term debt substantially. (Side note, their cash position has been *at least doubling* every year for the last 3 years.)
3. **P/E & PEG** ratios are 8.91 and .21, respectively. The PEG ratio is based on Finviz's EPS Next 5 years expectations, but since I'm a fan of extrapolating out a shorter amount of time from the most recent data as possible, a safer PEG ratio to assume is 8.91/11.05(Next year's EPS growth expectations), which would be .80 instead. Again, this is the *low end* EPS growth expectations for ASO. Admittedly, the previous year was a great boon for outdoor and sporting goods retailers, so instead, if you'd like to take a larger sample size of the last 5 years EPS growth it would be 8.91/32.7, or .27 PEG ratio. For a quick comparison, Dick's expected EPS for next year is an 8% growth and with a P/E of 15.77, that yields a PEG ratio of 1.9. But I didn't need to calculate that to tell you that Dick's is largely done expanding and growing. 
4. **Cash flow from Operations** has skyrocketed over the last few years, but it's important to note an anomaly. A large change in payables occurred from 2020 to 2021 which significantly impacted ASO's change in working capital. If removing it from the equation, to help get a better understanding of their cash flow operations, they still nearly *tripled* cash flow from continuing operations. Net income from continuing operations over the last few years has grown at an incredible rate too. (Yahoo Finance). Gross profit in general has followed a similar escalation path.
5. **The outside influence** of the guns & ammunition industry, while not a strict mathematical metric, should also be considered. Academy Sports, described by one of my Texas-born friends, is ""an institution."" Currently there is an on-going ammo shortage that's affecting the industry that is expected to grow at a rate of at least 6% a year through the next 5 years(Mordor Intelligence). The sports gun market is growing and many competitors simply do not offer to fill that market niche. 

**So what's the catch?**
Well, I talked about the Guns... I talked about the Money... What about the Lawyers? Academy Sports is largely owned by private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts or KKR & Co. Inc. for short. As of this morning, they own roughly 65% of Academy Sports, making them the majority decision makers for the company. I want to be clear, **this is both good and bad**. Such a large position of ownership controlling the decisions for ASO will almost always benefit KKR moreso than other shareholders. On the other hand, KKR invested in ASO in 2011 and have helped establish the company as a quickly growing and successful retailer. The two are intertwined in a way that is mutually beneficial to each other, but not as much for shareholders. **Fortunately, this will change over time**.

Academy Sports + Outdoors announced after market on May 3rd that KKR will be issuing an additional 14 million shares of stock. For context, that accounts for roughly 1/3 of the current share float so this will dilute the shares fairly significantly. The upside to this is two-fold: 

1.  Starting today, shares should start trading a discounted, enticing price.
2. ASO also agreed to buyback as much as $100 million shares worth of the offering, thus reducing the dilution and adding to shareholder wealth. 

**Subjective analysis:** I like ASO and I like its prospects. It has the growth potential that Dick's no longer has, their management team has helped been guided by KKR to profitability, and it fills a market niche that some other competitors do not fill. It's important to note that the unraveling of KKR's shares will continue to happen over time, which will simultaneously frustrate shareholders but also spread ownership to a more reasonable degree across the Institutional spectrum. Their new focus on ecommerce has helped strengthen their bottom line and it's already started to pay dividends *without* considerable store growth. In a recent report, management had stated that 2021 won't be a time of store openings due to the inability to properly scout locations(although it was stated that 2022 should see 8-10 new openings). This is the slow growth mentality that I'm all for. This will likely be a multi-year hold for me, but it could just be the next big thing in Outdoor Sports & Recreation."
2021-05-04 09:51:39,wallstreetbets,Lol sell & wait for the dip is what I heard.
2021-05-04 09:51:52,wallstreetbets,I like the widespread cover best
2021-05-04 09:56:58,wallstreetbets,"Diluting shares=puts will print. Sure I’ve been to academy. I believe they are having inventory issues like the rest of retail. While I don’t think they’ll go out of business or hurt too bad bc southern and sporting goods, I doubt they’ll see significant growth for quite a while."
2021-05-04 10:07:46,wallstreetbets,"They addressed inventory concerns in their last earnings calls. Better now than it was previously, and have more cash on hand than ever before to fuel growth. 

Also, don't look now, but there seems to be a chance ASO outperforms the rest of the NASDAQ today a day after this news of share dilution came out... wowza."

2021-05-04 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Time to buy the dip $AMD - short DD Hello fellow autists.

&#x200B;

Wanted to share some quick DD and some of my reasons why it's a good time to jump on the AMD train as a mid-long term investment. Full disclosure i have 100 shares and 2 short puts on AMD expiring 5/7 @$85. here we go.

&#x200B;

**Why buy?**

$AMD released their earnings last week with some pretty stellar results both on YoY and vs consensus estimate. They increased their full year guidance from a 37% YoY growth to 50%, and what does the market do? It dumps the crap out of the stock down almost $12 from earnings intraday high of $89. 

They say stonk prices are valued by future potential and not past performance, and it seems the market doesn't like good earnings or upgrades to forecasts. This I don't understand and this market movement downwards presents an opportunity to buy in when the stock is undervalued. 

As a gamer, i recognise how AMD has transformed over the years, and simply as a chip maker its clearly the market leader in CPU's now, and with an all encompassing monopoly over the current of consoles. There's simply no downside to their current trajectory.

&#x200B;

**Chip shortage.**

The elephant in the room is obviously the global chip shortage. I believe this is the core reason for all the FUD. If we dig a bit deeper the chip shortage is really because of Covid, more people at home to work, play and learn means more demand for tech, which is a great thing in the mid to long run. 

But I believe that the market is being short sighted at the moment, focussing in, and penalising AMD because of their percieved risk around being able to pump out enough stock to meet demand.

&#x200B;

**Final thought**

End of the day, i think if your investment horizon is more than 12months, there is a pretty strong bull case for AMD. Looking at the 1 year chart, there is a pretty strong support around $73-75.

As always do your own research , but hopefully you'll see what a massive potential AMD is.  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀

2021-05-04 09:23:15,wallstreetbets,One of the biggest reasons for the chip shortage besides covid is the drought in Taiwan. It takes a ton of water to make microchips and Taiwan just hasn't been getting the rain it usually gets. Some of the reservoirs are down below 10% capacity

He recommended a HOLD, based off, ""Most importantly, the company now sits on C$700Mn of cash and will look to M/A both domestic and elsewhere. Price Target $1.40. 

Tamy Chen, ranked #6,461 out of 7,491 as a analyst. She is not even a 1 star rated analyst. She recommended sell.  I remember the last webcast and she seemed negative about M/A and the joint venture.  

So, I am going to stay with Pabio's expert opinion of HOLDING. This rating was posted almost two months ago. I am looking forward to E/R on May 11th and will be attending the live WEBCAST on May 12th.

2021-05-04 08:46:30,wallstreetbets,Hopefully we can just get some attention and volume. The rest will take care of itself if that happens.

2021-05-04 09:48:18,wallstreetbets,Absolutely crushes earnings so naturally it’s trading at a monthly low

2021-05-04 09:49:52,wallstreetbets,LOL already 5% down. These are some seriously heavy bags. And I say that as someone who's calls are quickly becoming worthless.
2021-05-04 09:50:23,wallstreetbets,Oof

2021-05-04 09:58:34,wallstreetbets,I see the the red. But does it matter where I buy in? Isn’t it smarter to ride it up? Or should I get in now? I’ll be holding till I see a significant return. How low will it go this morning do you think?
2021-05-04 10:02:40,wallstreetbets,😔 sorry bro
2021-05-04 10:03:10,wallstreetbets,Well it's tanking now
2021-05-04 10:04:03,wallstreetbets,Don't you know regardless of good earnings the stock is gonna plummet the next day? Buy it when it settles down.
2021-05-04 10:10:42,wallstreetbets,Annnddd it’s down
2021-05-04 09:48:03,wallstreetbets,It’s down 5% today lmao
2021-05-04 08:24:19,wallstreetbets,Hell yeah. The reason it goes up and down randomly is because it just shorts shorting and buying back. It really has no volume. Hopefully this is the match that lights the fuse and we take off 🚀
2021-05-04 08:39:40,wallstreetbets,That is a lot of $$$ in CRSR shares...
2021-05-04 09:20:14,wallstreetbets,may i ask what % of your net worth you have in this one company? curious on your risk managment
2021-05-04 08:53:46,wallstreetbets,We’ll crush through $35 too trust. It’ll get on funds radar then we go 🚀➡️🌕
2021-05-04 08:30:13,wallstreetbets,Yes and no. As someone who believes in this stock so much you could make a case it was overvalued. It was sold off and was shorted but sell off was the main reason. Short interest went from 30ish% to as low as 18% during that time. It decreased which points to what I just said. I think they also didn’t think they could sustain the level of business and operation because things were opening up. But this quarter just contradicted that. Definitely see us going back into the 40’s
2021-05-04 09:41:10,wallstreetbets,They crushed earnings. I think it’s more due to short sellers than an actual sell off we’ll see in due time
2021-05-04 09:52:03,wallstreetbets,Exactly this... can’t wrap my head around it 😓
2021-05-04 09:34:07,wallstreetbets,I think short seller trying to kill the great earnings. We won’t know till a few weeks from now
2021-05-04 10:02:16,wallstreetbets,Take off failed. we were launching into space and then the rocket blew up
2021-05-04 10:05:53,wallstreetbets,Lol big facts. I’d be willing to bet it’s heavy short selling to kill momentum. It’s undervalued tech stock doubt it’s just sell off on good news. Could be trading in relation to SOX.X
2021-05-04 10:00:51,wallstreetbets,Annnd it’s down 5%…
2021-05-04 09:17:02,wallstreetbets,They’ll begin to cover within time. They’ll probably hold on but the way With the small improvements to balance sheet and the efficiency corsair is operating at the moment. They still have room to improve their margins compared to what competitors are at. If they do become more efficient I’d be scared if I was them
2021-05-04 09:01:21,wallstreetbets,It’s not unusual to still have winners on a down day.
2021-05-04 09:22:22,wallstreetbets,"Sure hope to see some red, I'll be buying heavy I think you are right we sell off quickly and the close will be very interesting"
2021-05-04 09:26:10,wallstreetbets,CRSR usually has a mind of its own

2021-05-04 09:29:40,wallstreetbets,"1) either people taking it as a opportunity to cash in on good news. I doubt that

2) it’s premarket stock still has little volume short seller trying to kill momentum before market so they don’t get crushed"
2021-05-04 09:25:06,wallstreetbets,"Bad guidance, beating doesn’t mean too much"
2021-05-04 10:09:01,wallstreetbets,"It's down 25% from the Q4 earnings, so blowout Q1 was definitely not priced in. The whole has been waiting to drop for a while and now it's happening."
2021-05-04 08:47:38,wallstreetbets,"Yessir ski got my money where my mouth is

If they continue to perform like this. I can see it being $50+ stock"
2021-05-04 09:26:32,wallstreetbets,I’m all in. What other way is there
2021-05-04 09:57:49,wallstreetbets,I was basically expecting EPS to be the same…I was really hoping the share price would rise on that news. Didn’t even get any IV crush on my short options…
2021-05-04 09:48:56,wallstreetbets,"lol ""short sellers are always the reason I'm a fucking retard!!!""

No, friend, it's due to tech valuations being absolutely insane and ""blowout earnings"" already being priced in for everything."
2021-05-04 09:46:16,wallstreetbets,That's not how things work. Get GME out of your ass.
2021-05-04 10:02:21,wallstreetbets,"20% SI is by any othen than GME metrics a huge number and if you look at the CRSR numbers, the 3B$ market cap is super low. That being said, the market situation is the most likely reason for the drop. Everything is red, the money is being taken away from the stocks right now and we might see a heavy drop in the coming weeks."
2021-05-04 09:58:10,wallstreetbets,"So you're saying you haven't noticed every tech earnings beat has led to a share drop over the past two weeks? It's called ""fully priced into the valuation"""

2021-05-04 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$BP - Major Play for May 2021 If any of you followed my previous posts/comments (e.g. $GME, $T, and several smaller companies I talked about in other threads) you would have done very well for yourself.

**My pick for May 2021 is $BP (formerly The British Petroleum Company).**

There are dozens of catalysts, for example:

* Rising oil prices ([https://www.caixabankresearch.com/en/economics-markets/commodities/what-behind-rise-oil-prices](https://www.caixabankresearch.com/en/economics-markets/commodities/what-behind-rise-oil-prices))
* $BP absolutely crushed the latest earnings released on 04/27/2021 ($2.6B quarter net profit, instead of expected $1.4B, earnings per share of $0.78 instead of expected $0.43 [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/27/bp-earnings-q1-2021.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/27/bp-earnings-q1-2021.html), [https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/BP/earnings](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/BP/earnings/))
* $BP announced $500MM stock buybacks for the second quarter ([https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/27/bp-earnings-q1-2021.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/27/bp-earnings-q1-2021.html))
* Europe/UK is completely re-opening ([https://www.npr.org/2021/04/06/984656647/after-months-of-lockdown-the-u-k-is-slowly-reopening](https://www.npr.org/2021/04/06/984656647/after-months-of-lockdown-the-u-k-is-slowly-reopening), [https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20210412-united-kingdom-eases-covid-19-lockdown-reopening-some-non-essential-businesses](https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20210412-united-kingdom-eases-covid-19-lockdown-reopening-some-non-essential-businesses))
* Travel Reopening Plans ([https://newsfilter.io/a/b317aa440b60517e32b3eff7a0cd7f65](https://newsfilter.io/a/b317aa440b60517e32b3eff7a0cd7f65))
* BP is constantly expanding into renewable energy to diversify ([https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/06/bp-aims-to-invest-more-in-renewables-and-clean-energy](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/06/bp-aims-to-invest-more-in-renewables-and-clean-energy), [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211467X19300574](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211467X19300574), [https://www.marketwatch.com/story/this-technology-could-transform-renewable-energy-bp-and-chevron-just-invested-11613458808](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/this-technology-could-transform-renewable-energy-bp-and-chevron-just-invested-11613458808))

**TLDR: I am accumulating $BP May 21 $27 calls & stock (shares). Looking for $BP to hit $30/share by the end of May.**

Do your own due diligence, but I have about 88% of my portfolio in $BP right now."
2021-05-04 08:26:35,wallstreetbets,"My friends works for them - they are restructuring too which means getting rid of middle management to make them a leaner organisation. Covid is being used as an excuse to get rid of a lot of dead wood. 

Long term this is a strong play."
2021-05-04 08:36:47,wallstreetbets,BP is a solid solid play
2021-05-04 08:48:45,wallstreetbets,It’s on a good run right now but after following it for months I’m waiting for the dip back below $25 to strap in. When oil prices move down BP stock has been getting excessively slammed so I’m waiting for 1 more good news story about COVID cases on the rise.  Only have another couple weeks before that window closes though.
2021-05-04 09:06:06,wallstreetbets,"I like the pick, I got in on xom at 40 @ 250shrs.  Inflation, oil goes up, stop the pipeline, oil goes up, green new deal chatter, oil goes up, increasing demand with reopening, oil goes up, iran shoots at Israel, oil goes up, china threatening Taiwan, oil goes up, create a pay to play carbon capture scheme,  oil goes up..Oil goes up = Stock goes up"
2021-05-04 09:16:11,wallstreetbets,"the oil rebound since corona starts is awesome. BP is is solid pick. 

Hint: tomorow is dividend ex day :)"

2021-05-04 09:57:05,wallstreetbets,"$BP is a solid strong buy for me right now. They seem to be on a good run right now and with them surpassing their expected earnings for this quarter, I can only see them moving upwards from here."

2021-05-04 10:03:34,wallstreetbets,"I work for the Senior Vice President of HR in bp and can confirm this is not inside information and can also confirm that this as already been done with 12,000 job cuts. :)"

2021-05-04 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Nokia is extremely undervalued at current prices On April 29, Nokia reported stellar first quarter earnings for 2021: 

Revenue totaled €5.1 billion, 7% above the consensus estimates.

Gross margin was 38.2%, improving from 36.4% in this quarter last year.

EBITDA was €702 million, crushing the estimates of €150 million by over 367%.

It generated €1.2 billion in free cash flow during the quarter, turning positive from the negative €6 million during Q1 2020.

Nokia’s focus on 5G is already paying off. Management is seeing “continued momentum in 5G rollouts across all geographies, especially North America.” And from the favorable margins in Nokia’s 5G products, gross margin in mobile networks improved 2.1% from last year, reaching 33.2% during the quarter.

And Nokia’s AI-enabled chip ReefShark – which is used to power Nokia’s 5G base stations – made up 44% of 5G sales. ReefShark is on track to reach 70% of 5G sales by year’s end. ReefShark is Nokia’s most recent semiconductor that powers its 5G base stations.

The ReefShark chipset is smaller, decreasing the antenna size by half, which makes these base stations less bulky and obtrusive. It helps enable a 50 – 60% reduction in energy use compared to previous chips. This lowers the total cost of ownership for wireless providers – a great selling point.

Nokia now has 160 5G deals, of which 63 are in active deployment. And Nokia is currently engaged in 60 trial periods where it’s competing to win the contract. Nokia will have a favorable win rate as others try to compete with ReefShark.

And this month technology consulting firm PA Consulting named Nokia “the industry leader in 5G standard essential patents.” Nokia has a leading patent portfolio with over 3,500 patents that are declared as essential to 5G. Nokia’s patent portfolio will help it maintain a technological advantage compared to its competitors.

Nokia remains extremely undervalued at current prices and it remains a strong buy. It was the first breakthrough quarter for Nokia and it is going to be a big winner for us."
2021-05-04 08:27:20,wallstreetbets,"With any luck, it will be at 4.99 by 2023."

2021-05-04 08:01:55,wallstreetbets,What's the target strike prices you goin for?
2021-05-04 08:46:59,wallstreetbets,"Yep, this is the issue with NOK. It needs a 1-10 reverse split or a *massive* stock buyback. There is just way too much stock out there for this thing to move significantly without Tesla-like momentum behind it. Which then just becomes a cyclical problem, because fewer people will invest in a stock that doesn't move, which causes it to move even less."

Bought two option contracts $172, set to expire at the end of the week, about 30 hours later that two contracts were worth $3100 - strike price rose from .86 to 16.55.

Because I’m not a paper handed bitch I hung on to my calls and figured RKT was gonna hit $40 by Friday. What instead happened was that shit plummeted. Instead of selling for three grand I ended up selling for $150 or something like that."

2021-05-04 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"AURORA CANNABIS ACB has 0 shares available for short sale?! SQUEEZE TIME!!! There are absolutely 0 shares of Aurora Cannabis ACB available to borrow for short selling. 

Zilch. Zip. Nada. 

Check out the screen shot and time stamp from u/GroundbreakingLynx14

[Screenshots of 0 ACB Shares Available and EXORBITANT INTEREST RATES](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockLaunchers/comments/n3wl60/monday_5321_fintel_reports_zero_shares_of_acb/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) 

The SQUEEZE IS ON and YOU LUCKY FUCKS get a DEEP DISCOUNT Tuesday May 4. Aurora Cannabis ACB went down on Monday May 3 largely due to the Tilray and Aphria merger. Tilray and Canopy took the biggest hits out of the Cannabis industry.

We are in periods of repeatedly low trading volume for Aurora. 🌈 🐻 are shitting themselves because Bulls are sitting in their mother’s basement high as fuck loading up on stock and calls.

The stock is going to blast off next week pre-earnings.

Get in on out-of-the-money Calls this week. Sell them for a massive profit when this stock goes flying next week. Buy puts that are set to expire within 45 days with the profits. Sell the Puts when it all comes crashing down.

Aurora Cannabis ACB Option Play

ACB $12c 05/21 before earnings.

ACB $12p 06/18 after earnings.

Good luck my retarded friends."

This follows a day of reopening optimism that lifted retail stocks. New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut will fully re-open on May 19. Florida is open effective immediately.

So the rotation trade is apparently back. Not much in the way of economic data today. Factory orders at 0830. We do have a bunch of earnings: CVS and DuPont just beat. Later we have Pfizer, Activision Blizzard, Akamai, and some oil majors: ConocoPhillips, Marathon Petroleum, Dominion Energy, Devon Energy. 

Oil is up this morning, by the way. Crude up 1.8% to $65.50, another post-pandemic high.

Looks like things might be melting up. Sell in May and go away at your peril. Not sure there was ever any real basis for that anyway. Just sounds good."

Do your research, buy some dips.  If you liked a stock at $50 then you will sure as f\*ck like it much more at $40. When everyone went into their panic rooms last March, cooler hands went in and bought JPM (it was in the $80s, it's now $150), FDX (it was in the $90s and it's now $300+), or CAT (went to $90s and it's now $225+).   Relax. Hold the good stuff even if you feel like you'll be ""underwater forever"" at that price, especially if it's got a decent dividend.   On that note, I bought more PLUG this morning. Can anyone justify a 7% dip pre-market on zero news after the stock already got CREAMED in the recent 3-4 months? I'm all ears."

Also - Fidelity wont bend you over prison shower style when you catch a short squeeze unlike RH.  Check it out and stop posting gain/loss porn with your Robinhood account.

2021-05-04 06:37:48,wallstreetbets,"“THE MARKET IS CONSTIPATED”

Most don’t understand wtf is going on in this market, including myself. And like most I make up my own story in order to be at ease and decide what to buy /sell. 

Overall think the explanation is quite easy and straightforward. “THE MARKET IS CONSTIPATED” Since last year it ate a ton of shit SPACS, shit EV stocks and wanna be vaccine wanna be biopharma companies”. 

So constipated it can’t go up even when the Crown jewels; MSFT, AMZN, AAPL, GS, JPM are doing amazingly well and deserve to go up.  

The only remedy is for the market to take a massive shit and it’s not whether it will it’s just a question of when.  And after last week and yesterday it may be much closer than we all May think."

Rule is same for all brokers, they are required to implement it. You can, however, open another account (as the restriction is applied on an account and doesn't follow you) with the same or different broker."

What I'm saying is that traditional value stocks are also currently overvalued, just like growth stocks. Companies like Coca-Cola are trading at higher P/E ratios (32) than companies like Facebook (27) or Apple (29), despite having declining sales and those tech companies growing sales 10-30% YOY."

2021-05-04 08:07:12,wallstreetbets,"Personally I use a combination of a relative pricing algo that I made in Python (Very simple, don’t believe people with hugely complex systems, it’s bs). From that I choose the stocks that are picked out as undervalued compared to their peers, make sure I like the stock, and then start watching it daily, even when I’m not trading. Then momentum comes in for timing a dip, but that’s obviously the least reliable indicator out of these. It’s true you’re bound to lose money at some point trading, but if you take profits and only risk small amounts of your portfolio at a time, you can make a steady income from it.

EDIT: Also gonna add that many daytraders literally have no financial knowledge what’s so ever and that compounds the number of people losing."
2021-05-04 08:04:25,wallstreetbets,That’s what short dated derivatives are meant for. You’re able to leverage small movements. Why would I hold longer than 30 mins when that could blow up my account?

2021-05-04 09:31:15,wallstreetbets,Yeah i was brainwashed by the community telling me to hold it was at 340 and i was up 645 in profit when i put 190 first for 2 shares and I thought it was gonna keep going but then a massive dip hit and it dropped to 200 then went stable on 230s

2021-05-04 09:40:12,wallstreetbets,And how’s that going for you?
2021-05-04 08:10:46,wallstreetbets,Thanks! Let me know what you think
2021-05-04 08:39:09,wallstreetbets,"Yea, it’s a little difficult to explain concisely. I’m basically placing more weight on relative valuation above all else. Momentum is just selecting a good buy in, but you have to accept that momentum isn’t always going to be right. The important thing to remember is that no one knows what’s gonna happen to a stock in a day 100%, you can just place the odds in your favor and hope for the best, that’s why you don’t YOLO the whole account unless you’re buying shares of a pretty established company.

As a beginner, I would stay with large cap companies that have low to average volatility. That way you can learn without fucking yourself in the ass.

Also adding on to my last edit, most academics in finance take the Efficient Market Hypothesis to heart. This basically says that the market is constantly reacting to all available information and that the price of the stock will always reflect that. If this was true, there would be no opportunity to day trade or value invest in general because the market price should always be right; this is why so many teachers and academics frown upon trading and favor portfolio management. In actuality, the EMH is just a hypothesis, it doesn’t hold true most of the time; I mean you can see it yourself with how this kangaroo market has been."
2021-05-04 09:32:23,wallstreetbets,And that’s why you’re red
2021-05-04 09:03:39,wallstreetbets,What? What do durable goods have to deal with it?
2021-05-04 09:41:17,wallstreetbets,Like I just got them at open
2021-05-04 09:08:53,wallstreetbets,"I daytraded 8 years ago. Lost some money cuz of shitty internet and read some resarch about daytrading. After that i quit daytrading and set up a new investment strategy which is a combination of different strategies. (anticyclical, future trends/growth, cashflow, moat and relative evaluation oriented. It doesn't make u rich but is yielding good. Most stuff I never sell.
But yeah I belive in EMH over the long term but short to medium there is definetly a psychological effect. Might be a good research topic for a co written master or doctor thesis."

2021-05-04 09:10:36,wallstreetbets,"So you're talking about inflation? Why do you think that companies that produce durable goods will do well in inflationary period?

He had to guess the price of everyday household items. The more items he guessed ""within range"" the more money was goin to be donated to ""his charity.""
He was about $10-$20 off on almost every item. 

Point being is - Billy G don't know shit about the world any of us live in. We don't know shit about the world he lives in. He probably is having orgies with pleiadians.

Long story short - this don't mean shit."

2021-05-04 05:54:36,wallstreetbets,My dumb ass spent too long wondering how I'd get into Melinda Gates' Tinder account.
2021-05-04 05:56:05,wallstreetbets,Now THIS is DD. Can't believe people just use triangles and long paragraphs.
2021-05-04 06:00:41,wallstreetbets,"It all checks out, I need to get married"
2021-05-04 06:02:02,wallstreetbets,"So the plays of the day are $msft, $match, & $kmb?"
2021-05-04 06:03:51,wallstreetbets,Maybe he will start to be happy at the end of his life....
2021-05-04 06:04:30,wallstreetbets,Nice
2021-05-04 06:07:18,wallstreetbets,"I can see Shitadel and Melvin shorting this.  Time for a short squeeze!  I'm in!  

But first, what's a tinder?"
2021-05-04 06:08:55,wallstreetbets,I'm sure someone here is figuring out right now a way to hedge this with Melinda.
2021-05-04 06:09:42,wallstreetbets,He’s trying to protect his assets for when the shit hits the fan.
2021-05-04 06:10:09,wallstreetbets,This is freaking awesome. To the moon 🚀🚀🚀 with wife and BG. Once in a lifetime moneymaker opportunity 🏦🏦🏦

2021-05-04 06:48:00,wallstreetbets,The dude couldn't handle her using an iPhone
2021-05-04 06:48:22,wallstreetbets,Does this mean ms. Gates is looking for a pool boy?
2021-05-04 06:52:38,wallstreetbets,Already priced in
2021-05-04 06:54:21,wallstreetbets,Wondering what if Bill don't use the app?
2021-05-04 06:54:46,wallstreetbets,"Non-profit Organizations, Donations and Divorce are the biggest gift for those MFB, but been honest, if was one of them, I would be taking advantage of these blessing gifts."
2021-05-04 06:55:18,wallstreetbets,Brilliant strategy. Now I need to go buy a wife option first.
2021-05-04 06:57:07,wallstreetbets,What if melinda sells or msft and invests in aapl ?
2021-05-04 07:01:43,wallstreetbets,Halarious!!
2021-05-04 07:03:46,wallstreetbets,"A master class in DD, I happen to be one of the 10M that ruined the sub, but thanks to the genius displayed here I can squint my eyes to imagine a rose colored vision of the past. On behalf of the newer degens we’re sorry & thank you for the blast from the past."
2021-05-04 07:04:59,wallstreetbets,Excellent DD.
2021-05-04 07:07:14,wallstreetbets,This would make YOU Bill Gates’ wife’s boyfriend! Talk about a POWER move. I love it!

Rich people are fucked."
2021-05-04 07:10:42,wallstreetbets,To late i’m already in Bills wife.
2021-05-04 07:10:51,wallstreetbets,Wait a minute... I thought the game was to get wife to convince Bill to become a GameStonk diamond-hand and send that to the Moon!
2021-05-04 07:11:32,wallstreetbets,"I love how he asks for space and privacy.

Ironic, when his operating system doesn't give you either."
2021-05-04 07:13:53,wallstreetbets,"Instructions not clear, stuck dick in toaster"
2021-05-04 07:16:56,wallstreetbets,"This isn't past DD of yore.

2021-05-04 07:20:12,wallstreetbets,Calls on May'linda
2021-05-04 07:20:37,wallstreetbets,"Do you think if I had a wife, I'd be here with you fucking degenerates wasting my time jerking off to charts and fantasizing about tendies and ranch dip?"
2021-05-04 07:20:43,wallstreetbets,Quality DD. My wife's boyfriend read it to me and then I looked at the pictures.
2021-05-04 07:20:48,wallstreetbets,Last few years Melinda has started to look a lot more manly. I think she is transitioning. Get your wife on Her/Scissr as well. Hedge your bets!
2021-05-04 07:22:47,wallstreetbets,Whoa. Being my wife's boyfriend is some *Inception* lively shit.
2021-05-04 07:24:18,wallstreetbets,Make sense. How is that even legal?
2021-05-04 07:25:12,wallstreetbets,$MSFT TO THE MOON!!!

2021-05-04 07:33:16,wallstreetbets,May the fourth be with you 🦍🦍🦍
2021-05-04 07:34:02,wallstreetbets,Is this a joke or are we doing this
2021-05-04 07:35:53,wallstreetbets,Something tells me they got a divorce so they could protect his wealth from the legal shitstorm that is about to rain down upon him with his crimes against humanity.
2021-05-04 07:40:01,wallstreetbets,🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
2021-05-04 07:42:34,wallstreetbets,And 10 million new people ruined Reedits top DD 🤔🤔

2021-05-04 07:48:32,wallstreetbets,"Solid Plan!
Unfortunatly, there is only one asset available and Tons of wifis with their Future boyfriends....

Price goes up!"
2021-05-04 07:48:35,wallstreetbets,"Exactly. Money is great, I hate people*"
2021-05-04 07:50:39,wallstreetbets,Why can't you just match with his wife? Her net worth will be half the same as Bill Gates when they divorce.
2021-05-04 07:50:56,wallstreetbets,Sounds like a PIMP to me..
2021-05-04 07:51:18,wallstreetbets,"Crayons kicking in......  what if, what if I go after Melinda Gates?  She’s got tendies too..... 🧠"
2021-05-04 07:52:06,wallstreetbets,Money glitch ! I seen this one on GTA

2021-05-04 08:01:08,wallstreetbets,100000 iq plays here
2021-05-04 08:01:45,wallstreetbets,Or you could just pray for bags of money to fall out of the sky like normal Americans do.
2021-05-04 08:02:47,wallstreetbets,I think you need step 7 - invest all cashed out cash in GME
2021-05-04 08:09:33,wallstreetbets,This is truly that high quality shit
2021-05-04 08:12:15,wallstreetbets,that’s the best dd i’ve ever seen

2021-05-04 08:16:25,wallstreetbets, Cannot believe you are not charging for this DD. 🧠🚀🚀🚀🚀
2021-05-04 08:20:51,wallstreetbets,I think I need to put myself back on the market.
2021-05-04 08:21:32,wallstreetbets,His wife finally got sick of his shit.
2021-05-04 08:22:30,wallstreetbets,Solid advice here
2021-05-04 08:22:35,wallstreetbets,Problem with this is you'll never get to step 6. Once she's got Bill on the hook what's she need your broke ass for?
2021-05-04 08:23:01,wallstreetbets,how am I first hearing about this on wsb of all places
2021-05-04 08:24:55,wallstreetbets,Probably get laid by her again that way
2021-05-04 08:25:05,wallstreetbets,This is the way.
2021-05-04 08:25:51,wallstreetbets,"IM REALLY SAD FOR BILLYS WIFE BOYFREND, HE WILL RECENT THIS THE MOST"
2021-05-04 08:27:20,wallstreetbets,ARE YOY TELLING ME THAT I CAN BE BILLYS WIFE´S BOYFREND?
2021-05-04 08:27:22,wallstreetbets,Meh... I've done worse for money.  I'm in!
2021-05-04 08:28:51,wallstreetbets,"I really do not know what is behind this stunt. Why would he/ they even need to make this public at this point. They own all the farmland in America, own their foundation, own the covid vax are besties w/ fauci and his wife, I mean....wtf ?"
2021-05-04 08:30:24,wallstreetbets,"Bill is now free to fight the virus full-time. As you may know from using Windows, Bill has been fighting viruses for over three decades."
2021-05-04 08:31:03,wallstreetbets,"Instructions unclear, dick stuck in computer."
2021-05-04 08:31:58,wallstreetbets,Bill seems more like a Jeffery Epstein typ... oh wait
2021-05-04 08:32:50,wallstreetbets,😂
2021-05-04 08:32:50,wallstreetbets,"He left his wife for Tim Cook. Long Apple, Long MFST, short HETRO"
2021-05-04 08:36:11,wallstreetbets,People said DFV’s DD was unrealistic when he first posted too. Guess I’ll have to give this a shot too.
2021-05-04 08:36:37,wallstreetbets,Thank you for all the time and effort went into making this OG WSB DD
2021-05-04 08:37:51,wallstreetbets,Rofl that was sooo ... 😂😂😂😂
2021-05-04 08:39:06,wallstreetbets,"the visual made me retarded. 

I don't see calls. my brain not work"
2021-05-04 08:40:43,wallstreetbets,Step one ask 🇷🇺merc hackers for Billy's digits as they own MS now
2021-05-04 08:42:46,wallstreetbets,How do I place calls on this? I’m fuckin in.
2021-05-04 08:43:11,wallstreetbets,"Instructions unclear, I just matched with myself on Tinder. What now?"
2021-05-04 08:46:32,wallstreetbets,The visual makes this extra spicy.  It needs a rocket emoji though in the diagram to be taken seriously
2021-05-04 08:47:14,wallstreetbets,Bill gonna have him some baddies.
2021-05-04 08:48:07,wallstreetbets,Lmao Bill Gates divorced bc his ex-wife doesn’t want to adapt into drinking poopy water and plastic meat.

2021-05-04 09:02:56,wallstreetbets,Rockets or no rockets i can't read
2021-05-04 09:03:17,wallstreetbets,Its so retarded it just might work.
2021-05-04 09:04:43,wallstreetbets,You might have to tongue punch her fart box first
2021-05-04 09:10:40,wallstreetbets,That’s why he sold most of his stock portfolio !
2021-05-04 09:11:51,wallstreetbets,"Unfortunately this would require an ape to have managed to punch well above his weight in the wife department, which to be honest isn’t the WSB way."
2021-05-04 09:13:06,wallstreetbets,It’s been a long time since I’ve seen this kind of deep dive on some DD. Well done 🤙🏼
2021-05-04 09:13:31,wallstreetbets,I just bought a billion stocks due to this DD...opening Tinder now
2021-05-04 09:17:21,wallstreetbets,I think I understand. 🤔 kinda hard with all those words though. Not enough red crayons 🖍

2021-05-04 09:28:50,wallstreetbets,Instructions unclear; dick caught in toaster.
2021-05-04 09:29:31,wallstreetbets,Man that’s a lot of words for Melinda is tired of Bill’s sweet lovin’
2021-05-04 09:30:02,wallstreetbets,Won’t matter once he activates her chip and she has a sudden change of heart.
2021-05-04 09:30:57,wallstreetbets,My wife's perfect new boyfriend!  Best DD EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!
2021-05-04 09:32:31,wallstreetbets,"TC, That sounds a great plan!

2021-05-04 09:36:55,wallstreetbets,You son of bitch! Im in!
2021-05-04 09:37:18,wallstreetbets,"I actually had this thought process with either myself marrying Melinda or letting my lady marry Bill. The only issue is the decrease in value. Can you really live off a quarter of their worth? Buy more GME and make one of them chase you! Get a prenup, don't share the tendies!!"
2021-05-04 09:38:01,wallstreetbets,"Finally, some solid money-making DD!"

2021-05-04 09:43:17,wallstreetbets,Does DD stand for dick dribble?
2021-05-04 09:44:35,wallstreetbets,"Good luck with that ""no prenuptial agreement"". Bill's no idiot."

2021-05-04 10:05:39,wallstreetbets,"So, you're saying I should invest in wedding clothes and flowers? Possibly Tinder too? That's what I gathered from this."
2021-05-04 10:06:52,wallstreetbets,Wouldn’t it be easier to rob him in a back alley so he spends the remainder of his years learning martial arts and becomes the hero we don’t deserve?
2021-05-04 10:06:55,wallstreetbets,You dont need the disclaimer this is legit financial advice
2021-05-04 10:08:53,wallstreetbets,It's always nice to see a bit of pure humor here on WSB.

2021-05-04 01:47:03,wallstreetbets,I’m big on SPLK too so I feel you. Personally think it’s way oversold being a profitable company with so many Fortune 500 companies as clients

2021-05-04 09:53:13,wallstreetbets,"This Splunk dip is dumbfounding for me. As an early adopter of the product (sadly not an early adopter of the stock), this product is gold. The company bleeds cash. Growth here will be off the charts in the next 10 years."
2021-05-03 22:10:38,wallstreetbets,Stocks only go up. Hold like a real 🦍
2021-05-03 22:08:51,wallstreetbets,That shit is redder than my dog’s dick!

I’m sure you have your portfolio beta-weighted and you are using index futures or less favorably options on relevant ETF’s to hedge those loses on down days. Your too knowledgeable to take -$40m days when you don’t have too."
2021-05-03 22:53:33,wallstreetbets,"A loss of 6.66%.

Shoulda sold when it was higher. And buy back low :( 

Let's see how these earnings go... And maybe there big event?"
2021-05-04 01:24:17,wallstreetbets,Dayyyyyum. You lost more money than I've invested.

2021-05-04 01:50:02,wallstreetbets,You reaaally gotta ditch this portfolio and buy GME before the market crash. Negative beta stocks are the way to go.

2021-05-04 05:56:37,wallstreetbets,I would be kind of disappointed if this turns out to be results from paper trading 😿

2021-05-04 07:21:10,wallstreetbets,Why are you balls deep in the shittiest stocks ever? Specially when we are at all time highs with risk of a major pull back? Cut your losses and learn alittle about markets for the sake of your money.
2021-05-04 07:25:49,wallstreetbets,"SPLK... So low, but what's the catalyst to go up?"
2021-05-04 07:29:24,wallstreetbets,Cant. Look. Away.

2021-05-04 07:52:50,wallstreetbets,Good example of how a short term loss becomes a long term hold. Been there. I have a 7 year loss that is about to be wiped out with 1 yr old gains. Good news: no tax on the gains. Bad news: 7 yrs no revenue on the loss.
2021-05-04 07:53:00,wallstreetbets,"I think the reason of the bloody red at your portfolio is that you do not hold GME and AMC🚀🚀🚀, therefore sell whole this shit and buy GME and AMC then you will see GREEN MOON"
2021-05-04 07:59:46,wallstreetbets,I always wondered why I liked red over green as a young kid. Now I know why!
2021-05-04 08:06:52,wallstreetbets,"I know! WTF is up with $SPCE? I saw it drop, doubled up........ Then it dropped more?"
2021-05-04 08:09:59,wallstreetbets,Congratulations!

What a scam"
2021-05-04 09:26:05,wallstreetbets,I mean you see red i see a mf with 500k in his account 🤷‍♂️ all a different point of view but good luck youll make that loss 3x over in gains

2021-05-04 09:28:08,wallstreetbets, But that 6.66% is a sign 😈 just do a few ritualistic sacrifices before market opens and you will be just fine haha.

2021-05-04 09:44:24,wallstreetbets,We are all red lol
2021-05-04 09:50:26,wallstreetbets,"Curious what offset most of that, since the total loss shows as slightly less than the first item."

2021-05-03 21:44:12,wallstreetbets,Probably not the same kinda $$ but yeah pretty same colour theme. Not too fazed. What goes down must come up. Catch the falling knife and load up to average down. Not financial advice. DYOR😉

2021-05-04 01:04:05,wallstreetbets,"It will reverse, but damn it’s painful to watch"
2021-05-04 08:56:05,wallstreetbets,"It's only a 6.66% loss, it's fine. That can totally be made up the next day."
2021-05-03 22:21:56,wallstreetbets,Why was this me this morning? haha. I hate it here.
2021-05-04 01:03:43,wallstreetbets,You definitely don’t want to get too deep into margin in this market. I like losing real money. Lol
2021-05-04 06:22:43,wallstreetbets,"That happened with MVIS last week.  Margin requirement increased so I closed all my positions early.  

I was sad taking about 75% of the profit I thought I had, but it went deep in the red the next morning.  Dodged a bullet"
2021-05-03 22:53:20,wallstreetbets,Why would you be called
2021-05-04 04:54:37,wallstreetbets,Same
2021-05-03 23:03:48,wallstreetbets,"I saw PLTR on there, that position is staying red lol."
2021-05-04 01:05:20,wallstreetbets,I agree with you. I think I’ll post again when this is green. Let’s see how long that takes :)
2021-05-03 23:43:04,wallstreetbets,These are call options...zooming out won’t save him/her
2021-05-04 02:04:25,wallstreetbets,Sklz makes shitty flash games? I don’t understand how this is a multi billion dollar company.. where is the big idea/product here?
2021-05-03 23:43:51,wallstreetbets,Better call Lil Nas X to run Satan the right way
2021-05-04 01:34:26,wallstreetbets,"SPCE is in a poor position long term. They had an early mover advantage that was wasted by the crash, and now Blue Origin has caught up and will start selling suborbital rides this week.

Meanwhile SpaceX is trying to build a cruise ship compared to Virgin’s dinghy rides. Once they start selling orbital and lunar cruises towards the middle of the decade then the suborbital market will likely collapse."
2021-05-04 07:46:44,wallstreetbets,"No, it’s a shit business model and will run out of cash before it becomes mainstream. Heavy R&D like that needs government subsidies/contracts, not individuals paying $250k for a flight."
2021-05-04 09:02:25,wallstreetbets,"To give you the non-SpaceX bootlicker perspective, you're still kinda fucked. The recent pullbacks have been bad headlines that really aren't that bad if you actually read the story (e.g. ""BRANSON SOLD HIS SPCE STAKE"" - he sold less than 10% to move money to his businesses that were hit by Covid; ""SPCE DELAYS EARNINGS TO FIX ACCOUNTING PROBLEMS"" - the SEC put out new guidance for handling warrants right before they were due to report).

In the short term, if they actually have a successful test flight you'll probably see $30 again the next day. If they cancel again you may see $10. For the long term you might as well roll some dice. $45 is a long way off - if you really wanna play this you're gonna want to average down"
2021-05-04 00:20:24,wallstreetbets,Idk man doesn’t even feel like loss porn when someone has 600K in their account? Down 6% in this market doesn’t at all feel crazy. But then it’s up 10% the next day.
2021-05-04 01:44:31,wallstreetbets,"Finally, I’ve found you. I honestly am baffled by this stock. I’ve been buying it down for the longest time. I’ve bought and sold the others shown here a couple times for profit, but AYX has brought zero profit. But I have enough of it now that the profit will be decent (if it ever budges). It’s a good company and a good stock, so I guess we wait this one out"
2021-05-04 00:08:19,wallstreetbets,not if you plan on ever retiring.
2021-05-04 04:12:47,wallstreetbets,Why so many people feel the urge to bet all of their money in only one sector? In my opinion even day traders can benefit from diversification and asset allocation.
2021-05-04 02:49:15,wallstreetbets,Diversifying is overrated
2021-05-03 22:54:10,wallstreetbets,A right of passage. She simply evolved.
2021-05-03 22:44:18,wallstreetbets,"Nah, this is retarded!"
2021-05-04 01:09:09,wallstreetbets,"It’s ok, my YTD numbers are good. I bought/sold SKLZ for $25k profit. Rebought lower but still too high. So now I’m down but I’m not worried about that one. I’ve bought and sold SPLK multiple times for profit. But this time it won’t budge. That one was like a no brainer, but it has died on me now."
2021-05-04 01:06:38,wallstreetbets,"Lol, thank you. But wait .... there’s more"
2021-05-04 01:44:35,wallstreetbets,That's ATVI - not on the list... but they have also had a really rough month.
2021-05-04 01:09:31,wallstreetbets,I have a vault of all red ones
2021-05-04 01:10:13,wallstreetbets,Don’t you love it when one superstar saves the day? So much less painful
2021-05-03 22:12:49,wallstreetbets,Parabolic
2021-05-04 01:18:59,wallstreetbets,Now that is nice!
2021-05-03 22:05:34,wallstreetbets,Ya'll act like that's hard to do. 🤷‍♂️
2021-05-04 01:13:48,wallstreetbets,I agree. And I’m going to repost when I am. Let’s hope that’s soon :)
2021-05-04 01:20:30,wallstreetbets,Good question!
2021-05-04 01:48:49,wallstreetbets,I like you
2021-05-04 01:16:20,wallstreetbets,"I’ll loan it to you, but you have to pay me back. 50% reverse interest seems fair. So you’ll just owe me $125k. Fair?"
2021-05-04 01:12:01,wallstreetbets,Ha ha ha ... real estate. There’s been a lot of buying and selling prior to this point. Now it’s just a bit of a wait
2021-05-03 22:45:04,wallstreetbets,You clearly aren't about the tech stock life.
2021-05-03 22:03:49,wallstreetbets,Them maybe I should proud of my 💯% red portfolio if it's so rare?
2021-05-04 01:16:48,wallstreetbets,That’s not all of it. Just what fit in the screenshot. There’s so so much more lol
2021-05-04 00:32:57,wallstreetbets,Not the whole portfolio.  Total daily loss is 42k so there’s gains offsetting most of the loss here.  Still brutal but not as bad
2021-05-04 01:12:23,wallstreetbets,Did you paint it red? Who had a foyer? That’s fancy
2021-05-04 01:13:18,wallstreetbets,"I played SPLK about three times for nice profits and this time it sunk and stayed down. I’m probably even on the year, but I need this one to budge so I can jump out."
2021-05-04 01:19:13,wallstreetbets,There will be no margin call.
2021-05-04 01:23:11,wallstreetbets,I haven’t lost half a million. I’m only down... today.
2021-05-04 01:24:43,wallstreetbets,"Good luck to you! This only shows my losses today, not overall, and doesn’t show profit I’ve taken through the year already. It’s not as grim as it looks, all is just fine. You just can’t panic about losses."
2021-05-04 01:25:00,wallstreetbets,That one burnt a lot of people
2021-05-04 01:15:11,wallstreetbets,"Oh geeez, just rent the bottom floor and jump out that window if you get desperate. I do think this will all turn around. The market shifts so quickly."
2021-05-04 01:25:35,wallstreetbets,Ouch :/
2021-05-04 01:26:52,wallstreetbets,Happy to help
2021-05-04 01:31:16,wallstreetbets,It was a pretty bad day for all
2021-05-04 01:38:03,wallstreetbets,"Please, take me with you."
2021-05-04 04:46:11,wallstreetbets,Sorry sir we're all out of green portfolios.
2021-05-04 01:46:50,wallstreetbets,"Thanks, it will turn around, it always does... eventually"
2021-05-04 01:49:10,wallstreetbets,Macy’s huh? Nicely done.
2021-05-04 01:49:51,wallstreetbets,I want you on my team!
2021-05-03 23:18:30,wallstreetbets,That guys all over the map
2021-05-04 02:00:28,wallstreetbets,Options can be so frustrating. With shares I can at least wait them out. Options require really good timing which I kind of suck at.
2021-05-04 02:02:34,wallstreetbets,"I know! It keeps getting close to my break even and then drops. It’s not a bad company, but it may be a bit of a wait to see the price come up"
2021-05-04 02:05:11,wallstreetbets,"Aww, well don’t be sad because my YTD profit is up. I’ve bought and sold SKLZ and SPLK a couple times for profit. And this is not the extent of my portfolio, just a screenshot. These will all bounce back, I’m not worried at all. So we can both be happy"
2021-05-04 02:05:30,wallstreetbets,Yes it was. I hope tomorrow is better
2021-05-04 02:05:45,wallstreetbets,I know right
2021-05-04 02:05:55,wallstreetbets,Anytime!
2021-05-04 02:08:19,wallstreetbets,That is loyalty!!!
2021-05-04 02:08:52,wallstreetbets,It’s been a lot of waiting and buying down. I’m ready for some selling
2021-05-04 02:10:00,wallstreetbets,Unite
2021-05-04 02:12:34,wallstreetbets,You too! They will recover.
2021-05-04 02:32:58,wallstreetbets,It’s going to rebound
2021-05-04 02:33:34,wallstreetbets,It really is all about % at the end of the day. That’s the most important number to look at
2021-05-04 02:31:11,wallstreetbets,"I’ve done so poorly with options, I think I can time the market but I really just can’t"
2021-05-04 02:25:00,wallstreetbets,I totally agree. I’ve played it a couple times for profit but this time it won’t budge. It will recover but it’s taking way longer than I expected
2021-05-04 02:45:39,wallstreetbets,Let’s hope for reversal tomorrow
2021-05-04 09:58:21,wallstreetbets,I absolutely agree with you. I want to buy more but I don’t want to get in any deeper. There has to be a point where you stop throwing money at a stock. But I may have no choice here. I’ve got to get that average down. I’m so glad you see the same value I do in the company. I’d love to know why the price continues to drop.
2021-05-04 01:17:47,wallstreetbets,Oh I’m holding. It will turn around.
2021-05-04 00:02:48,wallstreetbets,"red on the noodle, like a dick on a poodle"
2021-05-04 04:48:21,wallstreetbets,Red rocket
2021-05-04 01:19:48,wallstreetbets,It’s a couple accounts combined. These are just the top losers that fit in the screenshot. I have boring stuff too.
2021-05-04 01:25:22,wallstreetbets,"Ha ha ha same same same. I keep thinking this is the bottom,  but nope."
2021-05-04 01:25:44,wallstreetbets,Ugh :/
2021-05-04 01:26:10,wallstreetbets,No heart attacks... it will recover
2021-05-04 01:26:36,wallstreetbets,"No shit. With all of that, I’m thinking breaking even is now a win."
2021-05-04 01:30:51,wallstreetbets,It definitely will. My number losses are big but overall % change isn’t that far off. This market changes quickly.
2021-05-04 01:31:31,wallstreetbets,"I did, I do and I will. I have no choice lol"
2021-05-04 01:33:56,wallstreetbets,This is just today. I am up nicely YTD overall. But this little gang of stocks is starting to irritate me.
2021-05-04 01:36:02,wallstreetbets,I’ve got some demons to cast out. Be gone
2021-05-04 01:36:28,wallstreetbets,TDA
2021-05-04 01:36:56,wallstreetbets,nice!
2021-05-04 01:37:51,wallstreetbets,But it takes even more skill to sell every stock that goes down
2021-05-04 01:44:55,wallstreetbets,"Done it, doing it, continuing to ...."
2021-05-03 23:44:35,wallstreetbets,"Fwiw pennystocks don’t really exist in terms of a one in a million find anymore. IPO’s are all so damn high after being jacked up on VC money for years leading to IPO. With that said, finding a promising one is still possible. Use a screener. Someone here surely knows of one. I find mine my just browsing and buying on the idea. $SEOVF is my latest. Long holds."
2021-05-04 01:45:44,wallstreetbets,"There is a while sub for penny stocks, you won’t find that here. Just do a general search"
2021-05-04 01:46:18,wallstreetbets,You mean to tell me it’s ~not~ going to the moon?
2021-05-04 01:48:38,wallstreetbets,Honestly it’s true. My numbers are big but the % aren’t that far off. A $3 move up for SKLZ puts me back at even. Sometimes you just have to wait it out.
2021-05-04 01:49:24,wallstreetbets,Temporary damage.
2021-05-04 01:55:37,wallstreetbets,This would be true.... if my entire portfolio fit into one screenshot. I just sorted by loss.
2021-05-04 01:55:52,wallstreetbets,Lololol that one was pretty good
2021-05-04 01:56:41,wallstreetbets,"Yep, it moves so rapidly. I’ve been buying and selling same day just to take quick gains. But these suckers don’t want to move"
2021-05-04 01:57:03,wallstreetbets,I’m not worried about that one at all. It will come back.
2021-05-04 01:57:52,wallstreetbets,I bought GME once and sold it 45 minutes later for a $13k gain. Lol. That one almost gave me a heart attack.
2021-05-04 01:59:30,wallstreetbets,"You know, I think you are the only person who actually paid attention to the %. Everyone is commenting on how dumb I am, etc, and no one is looking at the % loss which is not that massive. In addition everyone seems to think this screenshot shows my entire portfolio. But it’s been fun watching the reactions."
2021-05-04 02:00:38,wallstreetbets,It appears so
2021-05-04 02:00:56,wallstreetbets,I don’t know about that...
2021-05-04 02:01:29,wallstreetbets,I have seen gains on Tuesdays and Wednesdays and losses the other days. So let’s hope tomorrow is a major turnaround
2021-05-04 02:03:26,wallstreetbets,Oh nice! I’ve been averaging down and almost did more today but I don’t want to keep throwing money at there until I see a bit of a reversal. Super happy for you! :)
2021-05-04 02:07:10,wallstreetbets,"The lows... both dropped significantly, but both were decent companies. So I picked them up after they made massive drops. But unfortunately they weren’t at the bottom yet. Percentage-wise, I’m not really that far off, it looks worse than it is"
2021-05-04 02:07:32,wallstreetbets,It might. It might not.
2021-05-04 02:08:06,wallstreetbets,This isn’t my whole portfolio. Just a screenshot sorted by loss. I’m green YTD
2021-05-04 02:08:29,wallstreetbets,Maybe next time
2021-05-04 00:43:13,wallstreetbets,Save 10-15% every time you get paid. Invest it. Profit.
2021-05-04 00:26:47,wallstreetbets,"Oh my gourd!

2021-05-04 02:09:46,wallstreetbets,"I’m probably older than you. Other investments, buy/sell houses, make more money... it comes with time. You’ll get there"
2021-05-04 01:04:21,wallstreetbets,[removed]
2021-05-04 02:10:19,wallstreetbets,Ha ha... well it’s not lost. It’s just temporarily missing.
2021-05-04 02:12:02,wallstreetbets,"To be honest, I have bought and sold SPLK three times for profit. This time when I rebought, it did not recover. So I have to wait. But it paid nicely in my other trades. It’s not a bad company, it is undervalued right now. I expect and decent rise in the next six months."
2021-05-04 02:12:24,wallstreetbets,Fair point....
2021-05-04 02:32:47,wallstreetbets,"Ha ha, if you want advice on how to lose money, I’m your girl"
2021-05-04 02:32:05,wallstreetbets,Three accounts. But this is actually the third time I’ve had sklz. Bought and sold two other times for profit. But now it’s being stubborn.
2021-05-04 02:30:36,wallstreetbets,Oh I’m just showing you the good stuff. It’s a screenshot sorted by loss. You aren’t seeing the whole thing.
2021-05-04 02:29:06,wallstreetbets,Obviously.
2021-05-04 02:28:41,wallstreetbets,"I think it’s a good company and the price makes no sense to me at all. So I’m holding for sure. If like a $120 exit point, that feels about right. But we will see..."
2021-05-04 02:27:20,wallstreetbets,AMD is a good stock to own though.
2021-05-04 02:26:53,wallstreetbets,This is the best advice anyone has ever given. I have my limit sells placed.... so walking away is the best thing to do.
2021-05-04 02:25:54,wallstreetbets,"It would be hard to kick me in the nuts since I’m a girl. But thanks for the offer, I think."
2021-05-04 02:24:04,wallstreetbets,"Honestly... I bought GME once, held it for 45 minutes and sold for a $13k profit."
2021-05-04 02:23:07,wallstreetbets,Oh no. That’s brutal. Hopefully it will bounce back for you quickly.
2021-05-04 02:21:41,wallstreetbets,He is a she. And I‘ve been investing a long time in the market and real estate. It takes time...
2021-05-04 02:22:24,wallstreetbets,No chance I’m taking a loss on PLTR. I refuse.
2021-05-04 02:34:16,wallstreetbets,Me too. I think it will
2021-05-04 02:39:41,wallstreetbets,"I like TDOC right now, it’s just expensive. I think it will do well."
2021-05-04 02:42:20,wallstreetbets,There wasn’t a flair for that
2021-05-04 02:44:55,wallstreetbets,"When we are congratulating one another based on who has the least negative gains, we have mastered investing."
2021-05-04 02:57:37,wallstreetbets,Finally.... someone who understands.
2021-05-04 04:11:41,wallstreetbets,"Oh my gourd!

2021-05-04 09:55:04,wallstreetbets,"Should have waited til this morning to post, it’s even worse now. Lol"
2021-05-04 10:11:02,wallstreetbets,"I think you may be the one and only person to notice that. Everyone is calling me dumb and what not, but It’s just a mobile screenshot sorted by loss. I’ve got MSFT, NTDOY, BA, UPS. Other sectors did well."
2021-05-04 09:56:17,wallstreetbets,Feels like Monday just never ended.
2021-05-04 02:13:05,wallstreetbets,I agree with you. It will come back.
2021-05-04 02:13:49,wallstreetbets,"Lol... that’s only if I sell, which I’m definitely not going to do."

2021-05-04 08:54:28,wallstreetbets,A medium grey would be nice.
2021-05-03 23:25:48,wallstreetbets,Buy the dip!
2021-05-03 23:16:49,wallstreetbets,That is what I am counting on!  LOL
2021-05-04 01:01:54,wallstreetbets,Exactly.
2021-05-04 03:06:02,wallstreetbets,The Catalyst is coming!
2021-05-04 08:56:57,wallstreetbets,So short the Catholic church?
2021-05-04 05:32:47,wallstreetbets,Wouldn't count on SKLZ reversing. It's a toxic stock that **deserves** to delist. Typical SPAC hopium crack-rock hours valuation and nothing to support it.
2021-05-04 06:43:56,wallstreetbets,Will it? Lol
2021-05-04 07:38:38,wallstreetbets,"> It will reverse

You sure about that, bud?"
2021-05-04 09:33:13,wallstreetbets,Sometimes I wonder if I’m secretly a masochist
2021-05-03 23:00:34,wallstreetbets,"Margin called. If you don't have enough cash or your account isn't worth a set amount, it will scare the brokerage into forcing you to sell some positions so they can take some of their money back. It's how they hedge against you using margin.

Essentially, you buy stuff on credit, they think you aren't worth the trouble, so they take some or all of their money back."
2021-05-03 23:01:22,wallstreetbets,"theyre out on margin, and losing too much so their broker wants to pay themselves back and they'll sell his shit, my guess"
2021-05-04 08:45:17,wallstreetbets,SPCE as well. He's got a great price on it but they've started drilling for oil despite claiming to be a space tourism company
2021-05-04 00:36:14,wallstreetbets,Not a single one of those is a call option. Those are shares.
2021-05-04 05:29:37,wallstreetbets,"Wtf lol? Are you confusing companies. SKLLZ is a platform to make any game an eSport, that’s it."
2021-05-04 09:00:31,wallstreetbets,You don't understand because you have made no effort to educate yourself.
2021-05-04 08:52:53,wallstreetbets,"> Once they start selling orbital and lunar cruises towards the middle of the decade then the suborbital market will likely collapse.

This sentiment is tantamount to saying somebody living in London will never visit Paris because it isn't as far as Tokyo.

Sure, they're both travel, but one is much more intensive and people aren't always looking for the extreme. Factor in the fact that those orbital/lunar cruises will feel somewhere between camping and living in a greyhound for a couple days and I'm sure there will still be plenty of people looking for a suborbital afternoon instead."
2021-05-04 00:22:46,wallstreetbets,"Even if I had 600k, seeing all that red in one day would probably give me an aneurysm."
2021-05-04 08:07:38,wallstreetbets,There is zero logic to this. I bought after it fell last quarter and it's down like 30 bucks a share 😅
2021-05-04 00:33:33,wallstreetbets,It's not even good tech tho. This is like Dollar tree tech stocks.
2021-05-04 06:16:28,wallstreetbets,Canadian lumber laughs at your tech.
2021-05-04 07:15:40,wallstreetbets,I see you everywhere lol
2021-05-04 09:11:44,wallstreetbets,I will gladly pay you tuesday for 250k today
2021-05-04 01:17:45,wallstreetbets,I'm also in SKLZ & PLTR. When do you anticipate a bounce?
2021-05-04 02:46:42,wallstreetbets,How’d you get turned into SPLK? Haven’t seen it in anyone else’s portfolio
2021-05-04 01:24:45,wallstreetbets,"Sorry I meant to “play” with, not necessarily lost all of it. When ever I put money into trading, that’s already considered gone, whether win or lose."
2021-05-04 02:33:15,wallstreetbets,Do you know how to sell covered calls or puts? With a portfolio your size you could be collecting some premium
2021-05-04 10:01:44,wallstreetbets,"I don't have a concrete example and I'm lazy, but at a high level - they have cash, they buy up other companies, so their cash goes down. Bottom-liners see that instead of what it will create. This company will never be the next Oracle, but they are a massive driver of storage and consumption of unstructured and structured data."
2021-05-03 23:45:31,wallstreetbets,Thanks
2021-05-04 09:20:55,wallstreetbets,Show us the good stuff. Right now you just look like a meme hunting gambling addict
2021-05-04 01:56:41,wallstreetbets,Still jealous of your balance!
2021-05-04 04:12:01,wallstreetbets,Ok.... 😂👌
2021-05-04 02:37:45,wallstreetbets,"I'll dip sooner. Some of my stocks on 5x leverage. Why a few percent down risks me hitting hard stop loss my broker forces. 

I'm expecting 100 at least to dip my risk plays, then I'll see. 

 If I had to guess why it's dipping so much it's because Microsoft's PowerPlatform is very good and it's longer term looks like it's got a blue chip challenger. But I don't think it works like that... Companies signed on, got staff trained, it's in the company now for many years."
2021-05-04 05:22:51,wallstreetbets,"Definitely for the long term, short term, it’s just annoying"

They do use traffic lights the same way as we do though."

For those less adventurous, who is going to choose to fly in the equivalent of a Cessna when SpaceX offers 747 interior volume in a 90 minute single orbit flight?

If costs are anywhere in the same ballpark, and Musk says they will be, Virgin is dead in the water at that point."
2021-05-04 00:25:45,wallstreetbets,Meh in a short period of time my account shot up to 12K and then back down to 6.8K. Lot higher % of my available cash and I didn’t freak out. If I can become numb to it I think a dude with 600K can too.

I bought it and sold for profit a couple times. And this time when I bought, it did not recover. From the outside the company looks good, and the price too low. But it just can’t seem to make its way back up in terms of stock price. Personally I don’t see any major problems with the company, but of course I’m just on the outside. Hopefully you see some good stuff on the inside :)"

2021-05-04 07:11:09,wallstreetbets,They are a petty culture though. Red can never be used for something negative there. Most countries don’t operate that way. In fact I can’t think of any other country that’s that strict about color usage.
2021-05-04 01:05:55,wallstreetbets,"Correct, these are not options. All shares. Couple different accounts."
2021-05-04 03:35:55,wallstreetbets,% matters more. You can be down 42k one day then up 50k the next day if it's a small %

2021-05-04 00:25:33,wallstreetbets,How many naked shorts you think it would take to bring down Robinhood?
2021-05-04 00:20:09,wallstreetbets,And RH can’t afford a customer service team either
2021-05-03 22:17:17,wallstreetbets,"Bullish on RH. Half of the screenies here are still rh, and we're the ones supposed to know better. The other folks don't care."
2021-05-03 23:11:29,wallstreetbets,Wonder what’s it’s worth now lol
2021-05-04 03:40:13,wallstreetbets,Yea no shit dude. That's the entire Robinhood business model. Are people actually surprised by this?!?!
2021-05-04 05:21:59,wallstreetbets,Beings they really have non existent customer service this means Vlad the Stock Impaler made 330 million for order flow and fucked over the little guy!

2021-05-04 02:59:37,wallstreetbets,Only a RH user could be surprised by this.
2021-05-03 22:18:35,wallstreetbets,Get out of that shitty “Broker” people what the are you thinking!
2021-05-04 01:51:29,wallstreetbets,This was public information ever since Robinhood was started. Who do you think pays for your exchange/SEC/DITC/FINRA fees?
2021-05-03 23:48:46,wallstreetbets,Alright which one of y'all still using RH smh
2021-05-04 02:11:27,wallstreetbets,"When RH goes public we should FIRST short them, and THEN all leave in droves. Their numbers drop, making us all money"
2021-05-03 21:46:11,wallstreetbets,"I wonder if they will change their pfof terms when they ipo, seeing as how theyll be making gazillions more dollars probably"
2021-05-04 00:57:37,wallstreetbets,This is why I still use RH... When I lose money I have someone else to blame
2021-05-03 22:59:16,wallstreetbets,"200mil on options trades. Nobody bats an eye,  10 bucks says less than half of the options orders they sold ever made it to the market. Too bad there is no way to check.............."

2021-05-03 21:52:24,wallstreetbets,Short the hell out of RH!!!
2021-05-04 00:14:17,wallstreetbets,Stopped using Robin Hood
2021-05-04 02:14:33,wallstreetbets,"SO WHAT!  If you’re butt hurt because Rh makes money by providing a FREE investment platform (NOTE! NOT a trading platform) by selling order flow then please explain to me how you expect them to make money.  
Seriously, you guys that are using Rh as a trading platform and then whine about poor fills, order flow, and restricted trading windows need to grow up and move to a real trading platform where you pay for your trades.  When YOU start paying for your trades like the rest of us then you have licenses to whine.  Until then STFU."
2021-05-03 23:41:43,wallstreetbets,Most brokers sell order flow.
2021-05-03 23:40:31,wallstreetbets,"Key word is ""was"", you fucks better move away from RH and stop Vlad from making money of you."

If we assume whoever is paying for this data is making at least twice the amount they paid (This is Robinhood's profit, not the profit of the Market Makers/HFT who is actually using the data).

This means in Q1 (January to March), the average Robinhood investor has paid over $30 in hidden fees."

2021-05-04 07:56:46,wallstreetbets,I’ve been using Robinhood as my “free money” account. I have 4 free stocks in there from them and o keep trying to find more referrals to get more. I also have some gains that I left in there so it’s all just free money that I play with.
2021-05-04 08:09:13,wallstreetbets,"Four days till I'm out, baby!"
2021-05-04 08:11:20,wallstreetbets,"Well, that's their business model. Don't like it, go somewhere else.

This dumb ape's opinion: if you've gone ""rags to riches"" via trading over a ""freemium"" platform, and you can afford a normal brokerage, you're better off paying the marginal yearly fees and actually have more order priority.

I'm sure the same applies if you are using a ""consumer"" brokerage service and then want to play with the ""big dogs"" (professional investors) who operate more in business to business transactions. Totally different rulebook by the IRS and also access to private investments.

There is a reason that office real estate price is higher the closer you get to wall street. Takes an order less time to go 20 feet thru fiber optic than 500 feet thru fiber optic."

I don't like them, but I especially don't like the people that didn't research anything about the platform and then complained when it did exactly what it's business model was entitled to do.

Edit: [https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-321](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-321)

&#x200B;

""As the SEC’s order finds, one of Robinhood’s selling points to customers  was that trading was “commission free,” but due in large part to its  unusually high payment for order flow rates, Robinhood customers’ orders  were executed at prices that were inferior to other brokers’ prices.   Despite this, according to the SEC’s order, Robinhood falsely claimed in  a website FAQ between October 2018 and June 2019 that its execution  quality matched or beat that of its competitors.  The order finds that  Robinhood provided inferior trade prices that in aggregate deprived  customers of $34.1 million even after taking into account the savings  from not paying a commission. """
2021-05-04 09:08:06,wallstreetbets,"Their execution quality is poor. That’s why they’ve been fined for it, in fact.

2021-05-04 07:25:53,wallstreetbets,"That’s not true at all

How would they hedge your trades? You think they’re selling you the calls themselves? Or shorting the positions you buy? Or buying puts on what you’re trading?

That’s so asinine I can’t believe I’m responding to this 

Casinos don’t make money by being on the opposite end of every bet. That would be the quickest way to fold. They make money by getting a tiny piece of the action. RH does that through payment for order flow. 

If you’re making $50-100k and up trades, the small price improvement some can offer might make them better. But for the majority of people flipping meme stocks or momentum plays in relatively small accounts, you’re saving money with this business model versus paying $5 per trade. And if you’re trading more like an institution where the price improvement matters more than the commission per trade, you’re a fucktard for trading like that on RH to begin with

RH is basically a casino that operates with an expense ratio lower for the vast majority of customers than they were previously paying and now they’ve forced the rest of the industry to follow suit"
2021-05-04 08:46:13,wallstreetbets,"I thought payment for order flow was illegal in the UK, hence this issue doesn't affect trading 212, hence it is also the reason why robinhood stopped their expansion into the UK"
2021-05-04 07:35:08,wallstreetbets,"That’s a good question. They’re all required by regulation to execute the best price available. But they don’t all use the same amount of vendors. Companies like Schwab use more and that’s how they can get more price improvements. It’s generally pretty negligible for retail customers, but it is true some of the bigger traditional brokerages get more price improvements

I’m not sure what you mean by free brokerages versus paid though. RH going to zero commish has forced the rest to be commission free too. 

Truth is, if you’re paying commissions for your trades still, you’re at the wrong place. I’d imagine Morgan or Goldman or some of the big sleezeballs charge fees, but there’s no way their customer’s execution or trading platforms are better than Schwab/Fidelity/TD. That’s not their business model to optimally support retail traders. 

They want to be a luxury brand 10M plus clients just park their shit in and let them manage for fees"

2021-05-04 09:05:27,wallstreetbets,"Good point. Then again Robinhood probably already made more than that $30 million since the fining, while their customers still don't understand they're paying more than they would with other brokers."

That's what it is for me and I assume most people"
2021-05-04 08:01:46,wallstreetbets,"Your rebuttal doesn't really address his argument though.  He said outright that Robinhood wasn't completing trades at the absolute optimal price for it's clients, but that the difference was still in the client's favor over the $5 per transaction model.  The fact that the SEC confirmed this still doesn't refute what he's saying.

If you're trading on a small account, losing extra pennies per share in the spread is still significantly cheaper than paying directly per transaction.  Period.  It's shady on RH's part, but ultimately you aren't getting hurt over the alternative until you're in a much larger account size."
2021-05-04 09:09:29,wallstreetbets,haha all good fam
2021-05-04 08:25:16,wallstreetbets,"True, but that entire premise doesn't make any sense. None of Robinhood's competitors charge $5 commission per transaction, so it's a ridiculous comparison. Sure Robinhood's payment for order flow doesn't cost you more than $5 per transaction, but then neither do the other brokerages.

And even if they did, it would be $5 flat, not per share. So you're right that on a small account it would be significant, but on an order of $10,000 that's only 0,05%, which is much less than what Robinhood costs you through payment for order flow.

At the end of the day, the only thing that matters is which broker allows you to buy a stock at a lower price on average, and that is not Robinhood as was proven by the SEC's investigation."
2021-05-04 08:58:21,wallstreetbets,"None of Robinhood's competitors do *anymore*.  Who was the first?  That's right, Robinhood was.  They shook up the whole market and forced their competitors to react or fade out for retail investors.  Look back and when all the ""free"" brokers became free and it was after Robinhood created that dynamic.

This sounds like I'm defending RH, I'm not, I transferred all my shit out because I don't trust them and because my account has grown past where I'm comfortable there.  But I don't have a problem with PFOF for small investors.  Small investment accounts come out so far ahead it's ludicrous over the former model.  My mom, for example, LOVES her Robinhood account.  She has 1 share or fractions of several companies she really likes using: AirBNB, Costco, etc, and if she paid $5 per transaction it would be a complete nonstarter for her.  Buying 1 share and then selling it a few months later would cost you $10, that's a HUGE amount of money for such small scale transactions.  


A good argument could be made that there isn't any reason to be using Robinhood *now,* but they revolutionized investing for small money."
2021-05-04 09:08:56,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, with that I definitely agree. We have Robinhood to thank for lower transaction fees and getting to the point we are now, where the rest had to follow suit and lower fees to remain competitive. But now that we're there, they're just a more expensive alternative that misleads customers into thinking they're cheaper."

* Every single cash flow valuation model.
* General money supply and liquidity in the system.
* Risk premium required by equity to justify investment.

2021-05-04 00:25:19,wallstreetbets,"There is some initial shock, but then life goes on. Tesla is not as sensitive to interest rates as it used to be because they have significant cash on their balance sheet now.

While there would be some effect, there are plenty of other things that would cause sp movement well before and mostly likely also drown out the effects of interest rate changes."
2021-05-04 01:58:48,wallstreetbets,"> Tesla is not as sensitive to interest rates as it used to be because they have significant cash on their balance sheet now.

LITERALLY the argument during the dotcom boom on why internet companies should continue to go up. Because they dind't fund their business with debt but by issuing stock."
2021-05-04 00:27:24,wallstreetbets,"Interest rates will make the entire market re-evaluate fundamentals.  When bonds pay a fuckton for way less risk, you need to justify not taking that.

This is a 🌈 🐻 position after all."

2021-05-04 01:59:59,wallstreetbets,"What do you mean slow? You know that going from 0 - 0.25 to 0.25 - 0.5 would already mean a doubling of the interest, right?"

[ On the website, Clover says its currently in 8 states, However, it is actually in 10 states however they haven't released that info yet. Just looking at the growth chart that YOY growth is huge, 2021 I expect will be huge especially if the Medicare age is lowered. ](https://preview.redd.it/jq5j24xe50x61.png?width=1293&format=png&auto=webp&s=82ddbc4ed0d0e6a16074747a2f82a98a28222622)

[ We can also see here, Clover is the fastest-growing medicare company in 2020, simply look at the chart yourself. This rapid growth only accelerates Clovers fuel. ](https://preview.redd.it/cbm19gof50x61.png?width=911&format=png&auto=webp&s=91f623b391031634a4d4f34e84ae39106d516737)

[ Clover is backed by one of the largest companies in the world, Alphabet or Google.   Something that should be pointed out is that Google's partnering with CLOV could be massive. MSFT is investing heavily in healthcare technology. Both company's market cap is 1T+ \(credit to u\/sugardaddy for telling me this\)](https://preview.redd.it/t41zlb3k50x61.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=9f4ce646c7f99e99d6e2459059aa0688e922057c)

[ Clover is an innovative disrupting company, its mission is to lower the cost of Medicare plans, Clover sees that the healthcare system is broken as healthcare is expensive. What does Cathie Woods love? Disrupting innovation! I think if Cathie saw this stock she'd definitely buy in! ](https://preview.redd.it/vfoqs0rl50x61.png?width=788&format=png&auto=webp&s=6d99f6a09ffd517206fd4233c26dc4c1617c3d47)

[ Clovers growth has been growing rapidly, I do believe 2021 will be a fantastic year for Clover, and maybe report its first profitable quarter.](https://preview.redd.it/fiinjtmn50x61.png?width=1149&format=png&auto=webp&s=2768290fc6df4867fe0d723ca88d3847407d1c5d)

[ This photo shows how the Clover Assistant works, basically, an app that can help you make decisions quick \(here's an example\)](https://preview.redd.it/humhrjmp50x61.png?width=1568&format=png&auto=webp&s=45eb4f36de7f6ab9a88a0c554d3c6f9d64fc463c)

**Comparing Clover to Teladoc**

[ Teladoc currently has a 25 billion market cap with a 10&#37; short float. ](https://preview.redd.it/asptmh9060x61.png?width=693&format=png&auto=webp&s=697a12de87dafddde75b9f5e81007f730329e4b2)

[ Clover has a 3.77 billion market cap, with a 30-40&#37; short interest. Teladoc is nearly 6.6x bigger than Clover, if Clover is even half of Teladoc's market cap, it'd be trading around 4x higher.](https://preview.redd.it/qtpq5cj160x61.png?width=722&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e4fb6fd2f277003b6af3428198d0ead0a060086)

[ Looking at the call options, on the 5\/21 expiration, there are a LOT of OI calls for Clover. This makes a Gamma squeeze possible](https://preview.redd.it/8pe4fkf260x61.png?width=1164&format=png&auto=webp&s=0917209919a165bfd026a4835bbb92018309671e)

There is still a lot to be covered, this is only a small part.

TL;DR: Short + Gamma squeeze possible good company backed by Google fastest medicare growth company + possible medicare age lowered which could give potentially millions of more customers for Clover.

My positions:

So with the recent fears and gossip about correction coming in next two months ., and the tax hike in play.. lots of money will rotate into dividend plays .. Snd out of high risk. How’s it go ? Ahh yes buy the hype ... but hmm ER seems like news ?! 

Next point is the recent public smear campaign of chamath and its resulting bad vibes associated with all his darlings. May still be a bad taste in peoples mouths ., and with Eli Lilly reporting this week a nice dividend play. Undervalued already before ER... 

And lastly and probably the most probable of all: what if there ER is not a blowout. I mean lots of great numbers this quarter .. lots of really good beats . But no matching price action.. kind of seems like value was baked in already on a majority of stocks. 
Healthcare is a tough biz, and is all about the big players revolving doors and govt money. States and federal govt used United healthcare for Medicare/caid."

2021-05-03 22:04:41,wallstreetbets,"lolololol, you pulled this shit out of their gimmicky slide deck. the fastest growing insurer ""22%"". All of 60k pts in 5 years. Look ma, I added 1 dollar to my 1 dollar account. My YoY growth is 100%. More than Warren Buffet!!!

We've got 60000 pts in 10 states. So 6000 per state? My church has more seniors. My high school might too. 

But ... 400m revenue and huge revenue growth YoY?!?! Any basic accounting course woulda taught you not to conveniently forget about expenses. Their medical care reimburse cost is only 103% of revenue. Not to mention debt and payroll expenses. Rofls, they burn 200m a year, with 4B valution to obtain 60,000 patients that they then can't turn a profit on. That's 66k per patient that costs them money to insure. Better yet, buy Nikola. At least that company knows how to sell a $60,000 turd.

But the app will save lives and reduce costs!?! So much cost savings after 60,000 patients and 5 years, that we're still paying 100%+ for their medical care. Hundreds of thousands of medical studies and big data research being done by braniacs in all fields of medicine, science, acturial giants, and these fools think they're gonna solve ""healthcare"" with an ""app"" that asks doctors to answer multiple choice questions on what symptoms the patient has.

2021-05-04 01:50:39,wallstreetbets,If only people would buy and hold actual shares instead of insane amounts of calls...

2021-05-04 02:44:39,wallstreetbets,You need to buy shares and not calls if you want the price to go up.

2021-05-04 00:36:43,wallstreetbets,"The short percentage is pretty out of date now. It's probably only 20-25%, which is still crazy high. 

Short percentage doesn't impact gamma squeeze though. Open interest (which is crazy high) and delta (which is somewhat low) do. High OI and low delta increases the likelihood of a gamma squeeze if there is significant price movement, as in a good news release or earnings report."
2021-05-04 03:38:27,wallstreetbets,"Yeah all of a sudden everything is now the ""next GME"". 

Without even realizing how rare the situation that GME is in right now lol. 

Not everything is about a short squeeze. Maybe you should do a little DD yourself instead of repeating the same garbage we see every day on almost every stock."
2021-05-04 07:37:49,wallstreetbets,"Gamma squeeze has 0 to do with short interest, GME has rotted the minds of WSB Apes."

2021-05-03 23:11:30,wallstreetbets,"Than you shouldnt have bought it. There are a few solid reasons CLOV is primed for take off. Pay attention to the good DD.

CLOV 1100 @ 10.50"
2021-05-03 22:03:44,wallstreetbets,Why do you say that? Would like to hear some bear thesis’s

Last, I checked most successful tech/software companies require huge capital upfront and burn their cash flows to build out the required infrastructure + while continuing to update their product/services. Once that's set, costs go down with time. 

Moreover, CLOV is set to be profitable in 2 years. You're lack of curiosity and skepticism has diluted you pal. Go back and do serious DD or maybe ask some productive questions."
2021-05-03 23:50:44,wallstreetbets,"thats why i said  ""This makes a Gamma squeeze possible"""

2021-05-04 01:39:05,wallstreetbets,Last I checked. The short interest was something like 44 million shares (from places that attempt real time SI calculations). This is about 40% of the float.
2021-05-04 03:58:17,wallstreetbets,We'll see you on the 17th ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|sunglasses)
2021-05-03 21:24:30,wallstreetbets,How do you think GME happened? With such an undervalued company with a giant short percentage. Do your DD.
2021-05-04 05:09:51,wallstreetbets,to the moon
2021-05-03 23:15:51,wallstreetbets,Was GME A GAMMA 🤔
2021-05-04 02:09:41,wallstreetbets,Not necessarily. It’s about 40% if you don’t deduct the shares that can’t be traded until restrictions expire which is huge. Meaning the shorts could get margin called and have to close positions. There is a new short report on the 11th or 12th.
2021-05-04 05:01:32,wallstreetbets,Bought in yesterday. Lost over a dollar a share. that's smart money right there. Ran right away from me to a smarter someone elses portfolio.
2021-05-04 00:33:49,wallstreetbets,Same. If I hadn’t blown my wad and waited the weekend to buy in Monday I wouldn’t feel like such a smooth brain. 750 shares @ $11.07 🤷 good thing I like the stock.
2021-05-03 22:23:31,wallstreetbets,it’s moved once in months and came right back down
2021-05-03 23:02:47,wallstreetbets,"oh yeah, the confirmation bias runs strong in this subreddit and the clov cult in gneral. it's just fun to shit on their parade.

in the world of moonshot spacs, I actually think OPEN had a shot. Their concept is pretty simple - buy houses fast via the web and flip em. clear business model, clear profit model. platform that actually works.

in terms of other weird meme-ish shit, I'm interested in seeing how BB will do. the people who keep saying they have $3B worth in patents are nuts. Some of their cell phone tech is from a decade ago. It's not worth shit anymore. That said, they do have a nice enterprise tech for cars. Maybe it'll be a big market player. They need to reinvent themselves. At their current valuation and share price, it's might be worth checking out. And they're liquid enough to wheel options on if you caught bag holding.

In terms of healthcare/pharma:

I'm interested in Kempharm: approved ADHD drug, reaching early sales/licensing milestones. Upside if the drug takes off. It's nothing revolutionary, but its a pro-drug platform that delivers longer lasting active metabolite. Smoother curve, maybe less addictive.

EOL - approved for competition to botox. Overcame a major import/trade dispute allowing them to start sales in the US. Just recently diluted shares majorly at 9.50, so I expect price will hang around there until a quarter or two of earnings, etc. Might be a good time to enter though.

SIEN - they make breast implants. They're decently cheap right now simply because COVID shutdowns and a number of pre-covid issues really hamstrunged them. Price is low enough to consider entering and seeing how it cosmetic and reconstructive breast surgery will recover.

ENDP - they have a decent pharmaceutical compounding business, a number of fun random proprietary drugs for stuff like dupuytrens and cellulite. However they also selling narcs and are getting sued. that's their major headwind and their stock has gotten pounded by it. It's at 5-6 dollars. I'm in simply on the bet that they will settle their liabilities, survive/get acquired/sell off assets, and price will gain at some point.

None of these companies is perfect, but they have a reasonable valuation and business models that can actually achieve profit. I'll take my chances with them, if I'm going to be doing a wallstreet bet.

I should note, im not afraid to short the shit out of crappy stocks, so clov and maybe even some
of these if they dont shape up 🤣"

Sold off from NASDAQ uplisting, but now institutions are going to load the boat ($MNMD sits at 0.09% institutional ownership of the stock vs. $CMPS at 16%). Also there could be ""**forced buying**"" by biotech ETFs such as **$XBI** and **$IBB** once $MNMD gets included/indexed.

Also short interest is pretty high, so a big bounce is coming if the stock starts moving back to the upside.

**Background on the Sector**

There are three topics everyone who wants to understand the Psychedelic Sector needs to know up front:

**1) Intent:** This sector is fundamentally different from the Cannabis Sector in a large way. The target market is primarily medicinal uses rather than recreational uses. Cannabis has a large recreational movement, where psychedelics have a small one. While this may deter some folks, I find it reassuring: to play in this space a company must be serious and committed.

**2) Diversity:** There are a number of drugs in the psychedelic space - psilocybin (mushrooms), LSD (acid), MDMA (ecstasy), ketamine (anesthetic), to name a few. Each is in some stage of clinical trials, and each company is attempting to use different ones to treat different mental and behavioral health conditions. These conditions are diverse as well, though the largest target markets include ADHD, anxiety, depression, PTSD, and drug and alcohol addiction.

**3) Delivery:** Psychedelic research today is not seeking to put high volumes of over-the-counter mushrooms or LSD pills in your local CVS. Psychedelics are being researched in controlled microdoses, and the intended delivery is by trained therapists through guided psychotherapy sessions. Psychedelics on their own may give your mind a period of disconnection and subdued feelings of fear, but with proper guidance from a trained therapist this period also becomes an opportunity for ""rewiring"" old mental blocks that lead to mental illness. Some people begin to break through chronic mental health barriers in just a few appointments. CNN recently covered the sector in an hour long special under Lisa Ling's ""This is Life"" series called ""Psychedelic Healing"" (Season 7, Episode 6). This demonstrates the delivery method well, as well as several early success stories.

**MindMed DD --> Kevin O'Leary, Bruce Linton and the Najarian Brothers are in this**

[Left: Bruce Linton \(Founder & Ex-CEO of $CGC\) Right: Kevin O'Leary \(Shark Tank\) are big investors\/backers of MindMed](https://preview.redd.it/7rnqywrno0x61.png?width=1275&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f8a41c0038250d725417596045d44295d6016ac)

Though my summary is below, don’t just take my word for it! MindMed has an incredibly well organized [website](https://mindmed.co/) where you can see much of this for yourself.

*As an investor in a sector with a diversity of molecules and a diversity of applications*, you want a company that has a diverse approach. **That’s MindMed** \- which is in Phase 1 or Phase 2 trials with each 18-MC, LSD, MDMA, DMT, and psilocybin tackling a variety of conditions, including anxiety, opioid withdrawal, ADHD, and cluster headaches, to name a few. This diversity give MindMed a high chance of having not just one, but several breakthrough molecules. Kevin O’Leary (yes, Shark Tank’s Mr. Wonderful) is perhaps the most well-known investor in MindMed.

*As an investor in a sector that requires integration with therapists*, including new tools and training, you want a company that is developing more than just the necessary drugs. **MindMed is the whole package.** MindMed has paired with NYU to develop therapist training strategies and has announced its launch of Albert, a digital medicine division meant to tie it all together. MindMed's recent announcements have indicated they are actively hiring to give this division more depth and to potentially undertake an acquisition in the digital platform space. MindMed is already thinking about **how** we make this work. In the future, a therapist will have use this digital tool to keep a list of psychedelic options catered to a host of mental conditions, and each will be tied to delivery strategies and training. MindMed's wholistic view from clinical trials through implementation is what sets them apart from others in the sector.

*As an investor in a sector that is ""breakthrough"" in nature*, you want a company that has the right leadership. In January, Robert Barrow entered the MindMed team as the Chief Development Officer. Robert brings extensive knowledge of psilocybin research, but more importantly he was part of securing the Breakthrough Therapy Designation with the FDA for his prior psilocybin program (Phase 2 Clinical Trials) at the Usona Institute. MindMed hopes to secure similar breakthrough designations for their trials and fast-track them. **Bruce Linton**, former Canopy Growth (CGC) Chairman and CEO, sits on MindMed's Board of Directors. Dr. Halperin Wernli and Carol Nast, President and COO respectively, each help round out the management team with over 50 combined years of leadership in drug and product development in emerging markets and heavily regulated environments.

Finally, I know every investor wants to know how much the stock price will move over time, so here are a few catalysts to think on:

[FDA \\""Breakthrough\\"" designation coming?](https://preview.redd.it/5llgt3osv0x61.png?width=564&format=png&auto=webp&s=c428b419525972f2570d9cdbf6462a8b15ac4dee)

**Next catalysts:** This is more obvious, but of course any trial milestones are catalysts! I’m particularly excited about August/September this year when we expect Phase 2b trial results to begin rolling in, though Phase 1 announcements will continue to occur as the portfolio grows as well. With any luck, breakthrough designations will accelerate trials and portfolio growth further."

2021-05-03 23:55:40,wallstreetbets,so there is me and one other guy who will LITERALLY  be the last 2 on the planet to make money as we both were locked in pre sale at 5. 98 per share... I am still happy I bought 200 shares not happy that I could have bought 100 more

2021-05-04 00:59:53,wallstreetbets,So like... do they have some kind of revolutionary patent on using this stuff? As far as I can see the drugs they are testing could easily be replicated / changed slightly by big pharma once they do all of the hard work. Something I'm missing?

2021-05-04 07:11:53,wallstreetbets,Does anyone else find it ironic that we’re rooting for ONE company to “cure” mental illness? In today’s bullshit PC society we still miss the point everyday that the current system does not help “solve” problems. It just sweeps them under the rug and hope to profit some more. Jusayin
2021-05-03 21:21:20,wallstreetbets,Was in MindMed from $.80 until last week when it hit over 2bil cap. Been looking at shroom stocks for a year now. I agree with most of what OP says but it’s very early. Shrooms will boom after the next correction IMO. Whenever that is

I had a string of bad investments in bio but really want to invest in this field.  I just can picture how they make money when the underlying product is produced so cheaply.

This is one of the reasons why cannabis sector is struggling because the black market is doing it way better and cheaper.  I can see this being cannabis sector 2.0 but worse because penetration rate will be much lower and the total market is much smaller than cannabis.  

If someone have insight please let me know because I believe in the product and use it myself once in a while in a therapy.  Help.  The 2 billion dollar market cap for MMED seems pretty frothy knowing even if they succeed in clinical phases, the products hitting the market is years away.  And the greedy executives usually care about their wealth more than succeeding in profits for the shareholders."

Full legalization is 20 years off if it ever comes. Many doctors and patients will be reluctant to use / prescribe mushrooms to treat any disease other than being unable to properly enjoy a Phish concert.

That being said I definitely agree that psychedelic experiences can treat a giant range of symptoms, including ennui. I wish this company the best of all possible luck."
2021-05-04 04:49:15,wallstreetbets,"20,000 shares and warrants accumulated since May 2020. I've ridden this wave up and down several times. Could I sell for a very healthy profit sure. Have I seen its value swing down 50k from its high yes. I'd rather let this company do its thing rather than try to time things. 1 year in and there hasn't been a single bad thing that's come out of the company. Actually it's all been great news. 

Yes the price is volatile but thats showbiz baby. The potential gains by holding are astronomical and I would be kicking myself for selling out. I'd rather see that 20k burn to 0 than get out before REAL catalysts for short term profit. 

The money right now isn't life changing and nor do I need it right now. Thats called proper risk tolerance and analysis. But if they even hit on 1 FDA approval, then the money starts to become life changing. They get several approvals and breakthrough status...I'm probably considering retiring before 40. 

TLDR; Hold long"

They don’t hold patents that are worth anything, they haven’t run multicenter trials in the US, they don’t have anybody working for them.

With a small marketing budget, you could create a viable competitor for this company very quickly."

2021-05-03 23:46:32,wallstreetbets,How did they convince you? All the DD i saw was not compelling in the least. The company is doing nothing to generate revenue and certainly won’t any time soon. The fact that it has almost no institutions holding shoulda been a massive red flag.

The harm they can do when you are properly prepared and properly dosing is basically zero (as long as you don't have some rare condition)

First test it before you ingest it. Then google the recommendet dose and stick to that. If you are fancy, google good supplements (psychedSubstance has a good video on that) and get those. Prepare shade and water with electrolytes (against over-hydration) before the trip.
Lastly: 3 months break minimum between each trip.

2021-05-04 00:59:51,wallstreetbets,"I’m with you man, I love psychedelics and have done hundreds of phase 3 trials on myself over the years with any ‘mind medicine’ I could get my hands on. But at the end of the day this is another bio pharma company without a product coming to market (at least anytime soon). This stonk might p&d a lot, people can make money if they time it right, but at the end of the day it could be years before this venture brings anything to market, and there will be no long term growth until there is an actual product in the pipeline. I see no catalyst in the immediate future (next year or three anyway) that would make this stock move beyond its meme potential. And I don’t hear anyone talking about overcoming the current federal prohibition of many of these chemicals. It’s great they’re finally allowing this kind of research to take place, but research is a whole lot different than tangible products. It’s a long uphill fight against decades of misinformation and FUD relating to the product itself. Can anyone tell me if they have plans to lobby to move some of these chemicals out of schedule 1? They can’t even get thc out of its schedule 1 jail, which is now backed by big money. 

Always calls on LSD, it’s the best. But I really don’t see the play here unless you’re prepared to hold for years."

2021-05-04 05:52:11,wallstreetbets,probably look at the marijuana industry. you don't use shrooms like you can use weed though.
2021-05-04 05:36:48,wallstreetbets,"This stock will not go up in AT LEAST 3 years. No catalyst, a product which may or may not work, a ton of hurdles to get to FDA approval etc, and on top of that, actually selling the products/drugs it to make profit.

2021-05-04 10:06:02,wallstreetbets,"Any idiot can grow mushrooms... you realize they have to have a 10 year cloned product before they can even enter an FDA trial... ISO9000 ratings. This isn’t chad growing shrooms in his moms basement. 

The need for opioid addiction therapy and alternative mental health therapies are threw the roof. This isn’t a 20 year pipeline. We aren’t legalizing shrooms. 

You aren’t going to get a bag full of chocolate covered caps with a sharpie note that says take once a day.

SSRI's were once the hot new thing that will cure depression.

I think there could be a huge excitement buzz. It’s only a 1 Bil market cap which means it could go 5x in this market because someone sneezed.

Phase 3 shows insane promise and we have a 50x. 

Option 3 likely will take a few years to play out.

Of course it could go to 0 but I don’t think so on this one"

I pray we see -50% before it all comes together so I can continue loading the fuck up. Your bags are good bro. Numi is going to crush it in the future IMO. Or I'm going to get crushed and need MDMA therapy."

2021-05-03 21:53:06,wallstreetbets,"Are you being serious?! My cost basis in that stock is $5/sh you just gotta hold it for more than 5 mins if you plan on making any money. Would you dig up a seed you just planted multiple times a day to see if it’s grown yet?

E b a n g earnings were Friday and every stock has been falling on earnings lately regardless of what they are so that’s nothing new. It’s at an all time low because it’s only been listed on the NASDAQ since the end of June last year and there was that big Hindenburg Research short sellers report on it recently as well. 

It has not stayed around $4 basically year round, it was over $8 on three different occasions just in 2021 so far! That is 3 chances for a 2x return or more in just 4 months. I like the stock and I can see it easily being in the $20+ range by the end of the year. 

You must have consolidation before growth. Idk when you bought in but if it was after the end of March then you missed the boat. I am expecting a gap fill in the short term to $6.22 from when it gapped down on 4/26."
2021-05-03 22:28:53,wallstreetbets,"I'm averaged in at 4 dollars. I'm just impatient. I'm not saying I'm losing money on the stocks I'm picking. Just that I put money into a stock and it drops immediately to all time lows. I'm not ""losing"" money because I'm not selling at a loss. It's just pissing me off. 
  
  
  
I can pick a stock for you tomorrow that will stop 5% just because I'm a shit magnet Randy."
2021-05-03 22:38:56,wallstreetbets,"Ah I gotcha. As long as you aren’t realizing the losses you’re obviously good, but gotta keep that in mind with profits too. I was up big on AMC at $14/sh and I let it all slip away and now I’m back to red. 

I do think it will recover but I could have hopped out for a great profit and gotten back in lower than I was before, and I’d be sitting good rn. But hindsight will always be 20/20 and you can’t beat yourself up over stuff like that. Technicals can only take you so far and they will always be trumped by news/earnings. 

Better to invest in the sleepers before they run than to try to catch the runners on the way up imo. My tip - look out for ticker “e e i q” - only has 8 mil trade-able shares and under 2 mil of that is float. It trades like a penny and any volume at all soars the price. It is just waiting for a news catalyst and I will be getting as much as I can until then - I think it’s an easy 10 bagger at this price."

2021-05-04 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$OPEN is GROSSLY undervalued and will blow up soon (DD)  

**$OPEN will be massive and will make apes millionaires in the long run, here is why:**

Real estate is a 2.5 trillion dollar industry and one of the few industries that has not been (yet) disrupted. If you have ever purchased a home you know **how fucking awful the process of buying real estate is.** Going to open houses, Your agent Tracy can’t find anything you like because she got her real estate license only because she is hot . Putting an offer on a house just to get overbid by Keith from California offering 100k over the asking price.

Opendoors ($OPEN) is disrupting this industry and attempting to cut the middle man, the real estate agent, and implementing the iBuyer model where you sell the house directly to them, for cash that is available in 48 hours. Fucking insane.

Now, how effective is this model? Well, in 2020 they generated 2.6 BILLION in revenue, in the middle of a fucking pandemic. Which was 45% less than 2019 when they made “Only” $4.7 Billion. [Here is the 2020 report](https://notorious-rob.com/2021/03/vip-opendoor-technologies-q4-and-full-year-2020-results-guess-whos-back/) They sold about 3,000 homes in 2017. Before Covid-19 hit, Opendoor sold just shy of 19,000 homes in 2019. That is over 6X growth in just two years.

&#x200B;

[That’s enormous growth.](https://preview.redd.it/r2ftcz7tbzw61.jpg?width=943&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=914753ab2d5075b8ff669a693bd188986e205a99)

&#x200B;

Every Industry that has a middleman agent has been disrupted, cutting the agent out of the picture. Internet sales is and it will continue to erase the typical salesman to reduce the margin. This provides convenience for the buyer and more profits for the company. Almost every industry that used to rely upon high-pressure salesman has been disrupted by technology. Replacing all the bottle service girls who got their real estate license and have a profile picture with crossed arms selling real estate will not be hard to replace.

Replaced the past years:

~~Travel Agents:~~ Internet

~~Insurance Agents:~~ Internet

~~Stock Broker Agents:~~ Internet

~~Car Salesman:~~ Internet

~~Taxis:~~ Internet

~~Me~~: My wife boyfriend

Why I Like the stock:

**The business model is the future**

Realtors are riped to go extinct like every other middleman agent. When was the last time you called a stockbroker to buy a stock? When was the last time to sit down with a travel agent to buy plane tickets? Or with an Insurance agent to buy insurance for your Volkswagen Jetta 2011? Buying real online is inevitable.

**Strong Revenues even during a pandemic:**

This is not a startup with products that don’t exist, they are not rolling down a truck like Nikola. They have 2.6 Billion dollars in revenue in a bad year.

**Overly Shorted Stock:**

Shorties lack wrinkles in their brain and decided to short this stock because they don't like Chamath, After the pandemic, a lot of whales took big positions against the real estate market and shorted growth stocks like Rocket, and Opendoors. You know what happens when these bets turns against them.

Everyone uses Zillow/refin, what makes u think “open” is gonna generate enough users to beat Zillow?

I believe Zillow has more exposure, more users, more cash, and honestly I find it hard to believe realtors are going to be replaced...

I wish u lots of tendies though!"
2021-05-03 20:37:17,wallstreetbets,Open isn't cheap enough currently and the housing shortage doesn't seem to be helping.
2021-05-03 20:12:23,wallstreetbets,Im waiting for Earnings to pass (around the corner) and im IN for the long on it..I really like the stock it will print as the housing market slowly comes back
2021-05-03 23:04:23,wallstreetbets,"These online realtor companies are horrible. Lots of
Stories of Homie and Open selling houses for below market value. In a sellers market like this it’s a no brainer to sell your house through an agent, pay your 3-6% fee and pocket the 10s of thousands of dollars Keith paid over asking. 
Maybe after the crash companies like this will have more success. The Realtor associations have hundreds of thousands of agents marketing against companies like this and they make billions more in rev to do it. I wouldn’t expect big returns anytime soon."
2021-05-03 23:16:05,wallstreetbets,"Car salesman here, I didn’t know I was replaced. We were just turned into internet salesmen hahaha. My dealership has the most high tech no touch, no salesperson, order online system money can buy. We get less than one order a month through that system even all through Covid."
2021-05-04 06:14:14,wallstreetbets,"Shit, I bought OPEN a month ago due to some nice (actual DD) in finance forums/“analysts” etc, and now i’m scared because a DD has appeared on WSB, which usually means it’s going down hard.

Damn you son!!"
2021-05-03 20:29:28,wallstreetbets,"I get a call, email, or text weekly from someone making a cash offer on my house.  What is OPEN doing that others aren’t?  I agree it’s disruptive, but the barrier to entry seems pretty low.  Have cash, buy house, sell house.

What am I missing?"
2021-05-03 20:45:22,wallstreetbets,The real estate market is extremely overvalued right now and a lot of people have lost their livelihood due to the pandemic. I don’t see a lot of people trying to buy homes.
2021-05-03 20:57:16,wallstreetbets,"No bear case, don’t care"
2021-05-03 21:11:36,wallstreetbets,Chart looks like garbage right now.
2021-05-03 22:06:31,wallstreetbets,"While this may be a good purchase I don't see realtors going anywhere. A good realtor is a major benefit especially in a world where people like to be hands off. Yeah buying a home online sounds great but just like a car you better go through a professional to make sure everything checks out. A great realtor can make a significant difference in your buying and selling of a home. Buying homes online sound great but it can also backfire tremendously and they are acting as your agent. You should expect to get less for selling on Opendoor  because they are trying to get your home at a discount to increase their profits. If this is a play it is a long one I don't see this as something that will ""blow up soon"" without a real serious catalyst."
2021-05-03 22:46:02,wallstreetbets,75 6/18 $27c checking in here. See you in Valhalla brother! 🚀🚀🚀
2021-05-03 23:06:19,wallstreetbets,"What's the better play, puts on realtors or calls on OnlyFans?"
2021-05-03 23:49:18,wallstreetbets,"Still plenty of money in selling insurance. Car insurance is fine online, but most homeowners are still going to want to talk to someone to know they’re properly covered."
2021-05-04 00:22:02,wallstreetbets,"There business model doesn’t make sense in a seller’s market. If there was a surplus in inventory, sellers may be motivated to accept Open’s offer, but with everything going over asking I don’t see what value they add."
2021-05-04 00:45:36,wallstreetbets,hell yes finally some $OPEN DD. I’ve been accumulating for weeks.
2021-05-04 00:56:22,wallstreetbets,Can you do this again with emojis?🦧
2021-05-04 01:22:26,wallstreetbets,"so they are wholesalers.

Zillow does this too.

downside is if they actually have to carry inventory in a down market, otherwise it prints money."

2021-05-04 04:56:31,wallstreetbets,"I called you out before on Opendoor’s TAM a few months back. 

You can’t define $OPEN tam as the entire property market in the US. 

You need to look at the estate agent industry. This is the space they are in."
2021-05-04 05:14:08,wallstreetbets,Where can I Trade opendoor? Cant buy it on comdirect or traderepublic
2021-05-04 07:35:01,wallstreetbets,We go all in Tracy at hooter or I'm confuse?
2021-05-04 08:18:43,wallstreetbets,"Eps -2.6

When travel and hospitality open up we're going to get a dip in home buying and building and that means home selling and mortgages. People are wanting to go places and they'll spend their money on that.

What is the catalyst for your may 21 calls?"
2021-05-04 09:16:31,wallstreetbets,"also like redfin and zillow

i read zillow like morning paper"
2021-05-04 09:39:39,wallstreetbets,"But that entire list of ""replaced"" workers still exist and still thriving. Also, as someone whose bought and sold many houses, the agents are worth every bit of that 5% commission."
2021-05-03 23:10:14,wallstreetbets,You didnt even do enough research to know the company is called “opendoor” not “opendoors”

2021-05-04 09:31:55,wallstreetbets,Finance Director at a Subaru Dealership-  record month last month 283 cars.  We sell cars on auction to Carvana sometimes.  Ridiculous what they sometimes pay for these trades.
2021-05-04 00:45:54,wallstreetbets,Carvana.
2021-05-04 08:45:26,wallstreetbets,Sometimes people just like to get off the internet and have human interaction sometime.
2021-05-03 20:28:29,wallstreetbets,Sold my house using opendoor in 2019. This is the way.
2021-05-03 21:41:04,wallstreetbets,"But in order to get hold of Keith you have to pay $30k realtor fee.  


I'm sure the guy from California has a smartphone and don't mind paying not for realtor services and $100k above other offers.  


But then again.. It's *Keith*"
2021-05-03 21:31:37,wallstreetbets,"And 9,913 people took Opendoor’s offer at the end of last year."
2021-05-03 20:24:17,wallstreetbets,I specifically look for this type of comment on DD now. If somebody says “the stock is only down because of hedge funds” it’s a huge red flag
2021-05-03 21:52:44,wallstreetbets,"I think we see a nice bounce before end of the month, and a chance at going back to 30 if they had a blowout Q1, and I think they did"
2021-05-04 02:37:39,wallstreetbets,"it's not the same situation, in 2007 you had zero percent interest rates for 3 years, and everybody and his brother was speculating thinking prices would continue up for no reason.  Today the buyers are not speculators and it is being driven by millennials at the peak buying years, econ 101 demographics."
2021-05-03 20:42:56,wallstreetbets,No freekin way. Anything’s possible but probably not in this inflationary money printing era.
2021-05-03 20:41:50,wallstreetbets,Ridiculous. Things cAn look bad w recency bias. She’s been killin it and when the macro scene turns she will be killin it again. Long all ARK funds. Only problem is the ER.
2021-05-03 22:19:03,wallstreetbets,The reason investors do so poorly with actively managed funds is that they chase gains when the manager is up and sell when the manager is down. IMO this last month or so has been the best buying opportunity for ARK in a decent while
2021-05-04 04:47:28,wallstreetbets,"She invests long term, she’s even said she doesn’t worry about what the market is doing short term which is rotating out of these types of stocks.  Their will be a rotation back in. There is no telling when it will happen but probably just after most people have given up on it and they will then miss the ride back up.  If she was choosing a lot of bad companies I could see but she can’t control the flow of the market short term and like I say she doesn’t care because she’s long term.  To each his own but to me I’m investing in the next 5-10 years not the last."
2021-05-03 22:45:07,wallstreetbets,"Let me get this straight.  You work for a competitor, but you are buying $OPEN.  

Are you buying your company too?  Or just them.  Basically is it a niche sector bet or this company altogether.

Feel free to tell me to go to hell.  This comment is very telling if I am reading this right."
2021-05-04 01:02:40,wallstreetbets,Would it be worth while buying the warrants? I just watched a 2 min youtube video for research and my ape brain still doesnt understand
2021-05-03 20:16:54,wallstreetbets,This makes no sense. Seller would be loosing the money not the brokerage platform. They still making money regardless of the sales price.
2021-05-04 00:50:04,wallstreetbets,Carvana doing excellent. Bye bye little salesman.
2021-05-03 23:21:56,wallstreetbets,"Well no the thing is; a lot of people are trying to buy a home, but inventory is abysmally low while cost for new construction is higher than ever. Insult to buyers is the historic low interest rate nevertheless cash is king. Even Keith won’t want to pay the middle man, but that’s hard to step around for purchases in this market especially for out of state investments/ retirement condos for snowbirds and whatnot. If OPEN can compete in markets across all 50 states then this might be akin to Air BnB in terms of convenience but without the headache of two other agents involved and all the hoopla they can drag you through."
2021-05-03 22:24:49,wallstreetbets,Not a valid argument when shit like Carvana and CarMax are doing great...
2021-05-04 01:30:49,wallstreetbets,"Don't underestimate people's stupidity. Lots of people would pay huge premiums for hands off services like carvana , open, rocket mortgage, etc. Especially when the industry is full of shitbags and useless folks. All it would take is 1 bad experience with a real estate agent to have most people say fuck it and just cash out through opendoor. Having open houses and stuff is a pain for most busy professionals. Even cleaning their house to take photos for an agent is annoying.

I sold my house for 180k through an agent. I thought i could only get 160k for it. If someone from opendoor contacted me first and offered me a quick 155k i probably would have just done it. Sure i would have lost 25k but it was 25k that 1. I didn't know was there - and didn't believe I could get and 2. The only reason why i was hesitant on selling my house is because i didn't have time to go through all of the hassle."

2021-05-04 09:48:15,wallstreetbets,"You forgot the Salt Life sandal sticker, so you know she goes to the beach once a year."
2021-05-03 23:33:13,wallstreetbets,"Housing market in 2020 was actually pretty good tho 

https://magazine.realtor/daily-news/2020/12/22/overall-home-sales-rise-nearly-26-from-2019"
2021-05-04 04:02:07,wallstreetbets,I’m also hesitant because of the massive lobbying against internet buying real estate models. NAR and the likes is a huge union. Seems like my local MLS and brokerage is doing everything it can to make life miserable for companies like Zillow and Opendoor.
2021-05-04 08:43:32,wallstreetbets,"Bruh just go in now and hold for a year, isn’t this r/investing ?"
2021-05-04 01:32:56,wallstreetbets,"Cavana's prices seem to be 10% or more above dealer prices, at least in my current car search. Quite a premium to pay for the convenience"
2021-05-03 21:57:07,wallstreetbets,"Curious for some anecdotal evidence- do you feel like you got a fair price for your home? I feel like in this market where people are coming in 10,20,30% over asking that using OPEN May be a detriment? Or is it just so much easier than it’s worth the opportunity cost?"
2021-05-03 23:10:18,wallstreetbets,You still pay Opendoor 5% to either sell directly to them or list.
2021-05-03 22:12:27,wallstreetbets,$30k realtor fee for $100k above what Opendoor would have offered doesn’t sound like a bad deal to me
2021-05-03 22:11:31,wallstreetbets,"9k of 5.3(ish) million homes sold annually in the US. That may mean more market for Opendoor to tap into, but their offers are often below market price and this is a hot market to sell in."
2021-05-03 20:40:18,wallstreetbets,Care to explain clover pos?  Has huge growth potential. The stock is currently a pos but the greatest companies had a pos stock at some point.
2021-05-04 02:38:48,wallstreetbets,"and demand as millennials entering into their peak buying years, 2x the number of boomers."
2021-05-03 20:08:38,wallstreetbets,Because people are panic buying. Houses are being bid $40k over list and tossing the appraisal to the wind. This does nothing but ask for trouble. Companies like Opendoor also help drive costs up with quick flips... And the current lumber problem is causing new build prices to rise as well... It'll stop when people aren't really able to afford... Which they can't right now because those stimmies are going to stop.
2021-05-03 22:27:17,wallstreetbets,People are buying homes upside down. Which means they’re paying more than it’s worth. This is not good for the housing market. Similar to ‘08
2021-05-03 21:07:34,wallstreetbets,I guess inflations better if I had to choose one
2021-05-03 20:27:57,wallstreetbets,What was her success rate before covid?
2021-05-04 06:55:24,wallstreetbets,"I have options in my company. We are currently a spac with plans to merge in very near future. My company merger is with Supernova Partners. Yes I buy our competitors. I’m confident in the business model, but Opendoor is the leader in the space for now."
2021-05-04 06:55:52,wallstreetbets,Opendoor is done with being a spac. You buy shares or options.
2021-05-03 20:31:43,wallstreetbets,"Not how open door works. They buy homes from sellers, charge a service fee for the purchase, and then sell the home to the final buyer when they have one."
2021-05-03 20:49:28,wallstreetbets,You clearly don’t even understand how the business model works. Maybe learn just the first thing about the company before commenting.
2021-05-04 00:13:59,wallstreetbets,"Okay, I browsed around a little bit and overall negative sentiment on Opendoor. 

Sales commission is still 6%  so I wouldn't necessarily consider that cutting the middle man and that's if you sell to them. If you're buying there is no price consideration for not having a buyer's agent and honestly, you would be naive to do that to yourself. If issues do arise after the sale you're gonna be shit out of luck picking through the legal paperwork on your own with no help from a reputable broker whose rep. would otherwise be on the line. There is an upside to selling to them, that is you get a streamlined process and a mostly decent offer. To be fair though, in this market any house that can be considered ""move-in ready"" in an appreciating neighborhood can be sold in less than a month."
2021-05-04 09:41:23,wallstreetbets,And millions of people choose to use Autotrader etc where it still involves a salesman. I recently bought a Model S and I did not choose Carvana as they were way overpriced and often was selling a lower end model as the higher end one. I had to check the vins myself on Carvana and found half of the models claiming to be Model S Performance where just regular Model S. Yea these companies have grown due to pandemic the same is also true for other places many dealership offer reasonable if not free shipping to your front door now for online purchases.
2021-05-04 08:37:30,wallstreetbets,"Also a homeowner. Bought right before the pandemic and only plan on staying for 5-7ish years. I am very likely to use a service where I just sell and leave.

As you say the money I leave on the table is not realized and so I have a much smaller attachment to it. Also, the convenience factor is worth tens of thousands to me. Especially when I'm looking to buy and move, I dont want the added stress of planning to sell. 

I didn't plan on walking into an instant increase in home value when I bought. Lots of people like me will see it as an opportunity. Sure I could have gotten more, but I'll still probably walk away from this place with a profit.

Opendoor, rdfn, zillow. This is the future."
2021-05-04 02:34:33,wallstreetbets,This made my night
2021-05-04 00:44:11,wallstreetbets,How about now though?
2021-05-04 02:19:41,wallstreetbets,"I suspect the pandemic affected the inner operations of the company. Quality control, IT, sales, marketing, accounting, etc., were all affected to some degree. OPEN was founded in 2014 and was likely impacted more by the virus than RKT as they were in the beginning stages of positioning themselves for growth. Whereas RKT had several years under them, being founded in 1985."
2021-05-04 08:26:29,wallstreetbets,"My nephew's keep telling me what they want to do for a living every time I visit. The next time I visit they've changed their minds.

Attorney, real estate agent, etc.

Now he wants to be a chef. He's going to be miserable in that saturated market with shit hours and low pay.

I keep telling them get the job you might hate but pays the most. Read everything you can about trading and live with your parents until your 28. If you aren't an idiot and you apply yourself you should have enough to live modestly without a job and comfortably with a job and weather any economic changes.

Kids don't listen. Nobody told me shit when I was a kid. ""Youre 18. Cya!"""
2021-05-04 02:39:26,wallstreetbets,"That and the shipping price is non-refundable. Sucks if you get the car delivered and test drive it and realize it’s a piece of s*** Now you’re out $6-700 for shipping. I’m flying 400 miles to go test drive / buy a car for $100 and about $150 in gas to get it home instead.

Edit: “bad” words are frowned upon now? Lame."
2021-05-03 22:01:38,wallstreetbets,"For me it was just so. damn. easy. No showings, no hassle, no last minute repairs. Initial inspection, final inspection, sign here sir. For me the appraisal was in line with the market so it was great."
2021-05-04 01:23:25,wallstreetbets,"I know right, and there are no inspections if the person wants the house. You could literally just say 'I'm taking the first offer to meet asking price with no inspections or contingencies' and bam - its sold. The agent will handle literally all of the paperwork. I don't get what is so hard about selling a house. The agent just suggests that you do things like clean your yard and take nice photos. You could sell any house right now, in any condition, and the price you would receive is above what open would pay you."

You just let 2008 come out of your mouth and then said this."
2021-05-03 20:29:08,wallstreetbets,1400 bucks and 600 a week ain't buying nobody a home lol
2021-05-04 02:39:33,wallstreetbets,not even close the 2008 situation.
2021-05-04 02:36:12,wallstreetbets,"No, the problem in 08 was that supply outstretched demand and prices fell which put tons of people underwater combined with stupid loan terms. Builders were just printing money and building like mad. Not so now, they would if they could, but they can't. Get worried in about 2024 if this keeps up and supply surpasses demand again. No comment on Open, except I think they're going to suffer from unlucky timing."
2021-05-03 20:41:00,wallstreetbets,"she did well in 2016 and 2017 but 2018 and 2019 was completely flat, so some of her picks may have to be held for 5 years"
2021-05-03 20:35:21,wallstreetbets,yeah that’s right. Still what the guy said doesn’t make a lot of sense. Taking losses on some homes doesn’t equate to “go out of business immediately”. Also they need to have houses sitting for sale with no buyers for a long while before the housing market turns down enough for them to be eating big losses
2021-05-04 08:19:46,wallstreetbets,Did he make your breakfast too?
2021-05-04 05:22:41,wallstreetbets,"Open literally sold their inventory because of covid... Why are you comparing them to rocket, they're totally different types of company"
2021-05-04 10:08:11,wallstreetbets,They sent one of my clients a short range m3 when he requested LR lol
2021-05-03 22:15:21,wallstreetbets,Good to know
2021-05-04 08:50:12,wallstreetbets,"Exactly. The guy above needs to do some research on what it costs to build a home. Something even as little as a kitchen can run into the tens of thousands if you want something nice, and that ain’t even the building materials for the structure."
2021-05-04 00:09:52,wallstreetbets,She takes on crazy risk with her picks.  Just take the Nasdaq and filter to the highest beta stocks and you'll have something just as good as ARK.  Works terrific when the fed rains $7T+ on the market and people are flinging it around like a coked up sailor... Kudos to her though for recognizing what was going on while all us retards were buying SPY puts.
2021-05-03 20:51:04,wallstreetbets,"They buy the homes flat out. And in some cases even fix the repairs before listing and reselling. The buy billions of dollars worth of homes. Have that on inventory and let the market crash, they would be absolutely screwed"
2021-05-04 08:23:14,wallstreetbets,*blush*

2021-05-04 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Corn: Ethanol Demand, Lack of Supply, Odd Weather and Expensive Inputs TLDR: **Long July corn** (futures preferred) although any ETF with exposure to cash corn would be OK. There are also options on corn. I'm sorry if you can't trade futures. The next contract in September would not be preferred since that's the start of the harvest which usually runs into November.

If you have been watching the news, expensive agriculture has been nothing new in the past month. That shouldn't be too worrying, since the May Corn which set a high at $7.40/bsh was due to lack of old-stored stock because no one planted that much or thought to store that much during the recession. This is kinda like the opposite of the negative oil prices last year when there was 0 demand and full storage, because right not there is quite brisk demand (not from food, but ethanol producers) and rapidly decreasing grain stores. July corn should also face the exact same problem, possibly worse as fertilizer prices are climbing and a few other factors detailed below.

**Ethanol Demand**: Who uses the most corn? Nope, not farmers for feed or your fat wife but ethanol producers. What happens to all that ethanol? Except for some good ol' states like Oklahoma which sells mostly 100% pure American anticommunist gasoline, the ethanol is used for fuel. A quick google search will yield [articles reporting that fuel demand for end of March has surpassed levels set during 2020](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-products-gasoline/u-s-gasoline-demand-exceeds-2020-levels-for-first-time-in-2021-opis-idUSKBN2BM1UR). Americans are driving/traveling again as more and more of us are getting vaccinated, simply don't care, or are forced to commute back to the office. This will result in continued high demand for gasoline, and thus ethanol.

**Lack of Supply**: This is the critical part that resulted in May Corn's sharp rise. Supply as of right now might not be getting better, and thus should also play into July Corn's pricing. These are largely weather based, but starting with...

**Corn Stocks are still trending down**: If you've ever watched Trading Places and wondered if you can make a killing on the [crop report](https://www.nass.usda.gov/Publications/), here's your chance. This is the March 2021 grains report, and the headline is that [Corn stocks are -3% from 2020](https://downloads.usda.library.cornell.edu/usda-esmis/files/xg94hp534/db78v700p/7p88db273/grst0321.pdf). But this doesn't show the trend. Flip to page 4.

Essentially all the 2020 harvest should be accounted for in December 2020 (harvest for corn is usually Sept - Nov). The demand is almost 250 million bushels more than the similar timeframe from last year. Also remember when looking at the March 2020 data below, that is when gasoline demand and food demand dropped through the floor. We're not going to get any new corn until September, so this summer of relying on what we have still in storage is going to get tight.

**Weather pt1 Droughts**: Even though weather this summer won't affect July corn which should already be in storage, inclement weather might force users to bring forward their deliveries, because they won't be sure if their September/December stocks will even be there. Right now, the midwest is starting to see[signs of a drought](https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/) (if you're going to trade this, this site has to become your new bookmarked page). A look at the historical patterns, and you can see more and more of the midwest is [facing inclement drought conditions](https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/CurrentMap/StateDroughtMonitor.aspx?Midwest).

**Weather pt2 Odd Weather Patterns**: Now I haven't read any scholarly articles for this, but doesn't it seem weather is odd this year for most of the country? First the [big winds from last year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_2020_Midwest_derecho), then the early 2021 [big polar vortex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/February_2021_North_American_cold_wave) that made a big V shape, and then sudden warming we're seeing now. I won't be so shocked if some big storm happens this summer to affect the heartland. Corn is very susceptible to storms because the roots are really shallow.

**Weather pt3 Stress**: In any case, the weather so far might be leading to stressed corn. I have some BS11 planted in the middle of Texas, and it's already tasseling without any ears. This may be due to heat and drought conditions, but in any case I've heard farmers' horror stories of having their entire acreage sold for sileage because not one ear grew. Here's a pic of mine. The corn is about 4ft tall right now.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/g9sgyn7bbzw61.jpg?width=2976&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=476caf52a3d8542e8e2048d5e456102d12f9a80d

&#x200B;

**High input costs**: This shouldn't color you shocked, but there's a [fertilizer shortage](https://www.agweb.com/news/crops/planting/fertilizer-shortage-ken-ferrie-weighs-fertilizer-issues-spring) going on too. You gotta use that and pesticides. I'm not sure if farmers have calculated this, but there's about at 20% increase in prices. Naturally I hope this means they're not willing to hedge their prices at a lower level (selling into the market), further helping prices go higher.

&#x200B;

**Other considerations**: Corn is an international crop, but most of it is in the US. Brazil and Ukraine should have good planting, but once again that shouldn't affect July because of the supply/demand imbalance. There's also something about a locust infestation in Indiana. But, [plantings are increasing at a brisk pace](https://www.agweb.com/news/crops/planting/corn-planting-progress-leaps-29-points-beats-2020s-historic-jump). That might be why prices dropped today which I bought into.

These are my positions. I look forward to keep buying 2-5 contracts at a time and holding towards expiration in 57 days.

2021-05-04 09:23:29,wallstreetbets,"I think the bear argument against RKT is that they were only able to make that profit in a year in which borrowing money is super cheap which led to a lot of refinances and that the growth they saw last year isn't sustainable and that's why it's been held down.   The expectation is that earnings will be good, but the future doesn't look as good as last year."

Unlike PLTR, RKT prints money. I could easily see them issuing a $1.50 or $2 dividend."

2021-05-03 21:41:28,wallstreetbets,">hard to imagine that it's undervalued

And TSLA was the envy of the the EV space. The reason they were undervalued (or overvalued now) is because their other impending operations weren't considered.

Dan's not quite Elon, and RKT isn't TSLA, but you get the point. It is a dynamic at the heart of that debate. Judging by last earning it is contested, to say the least."

It's a crapshoot. About the best you can do is look at prior earnings results and corresponding response for the same stock.  In RKTs case on incredible earnings last time, it went up a little, stalled, shot up more, then back to earth."

2021-05-03 20:47:44,wallstreetbets,when you average down you decrease the cost-per-share basis and increase your share quantity. Therefore when stock does moon you get more tendies.
2021-05-04 02:12:54,wallstreetbets,If you have a bunch of test scores where 1 score is a 99 and the rest are 50's what's the average score of the group...?
2021-05-04 06:34:46,wallstreetbets,"They are still there.  As you average down, you can get out at break even at a lower share price.  Your gains from lower sp purchases negate the losses from higher sp purchases."
2021-05-04 08:49:01,wallstreetbets,If loweres your break even point. If you bought at 20 it drops to 10 you could average down to say 15 now if the stock goes up to 15 you can get out and break even or make money at anything higher.

2021-05-04 09:18:13,wallstreetbets,Lol I lost 2 BNB. Sent 1 and he said minimum is 2 BNB. I was suspicious but it was my first time doing a presale. I was prepared to get screwed with a potentially worthless coin but not no coin at all.
2021-05-04 09:22:04,wallstreetbets,Did you see they got Justin Bieber on board and he's donating 2% of whole supply. Sounds too good to be true but I will try it

Man I feel all kinds of ways for the poor schmucks still sending him money."

Later, I joined the Telegram channel of the people who lost their BNBs, one of the guy said he lost $70k."

**Short Interest**

Short interest on $X is 17% as of today. Citadel is obviously among who’s shorting it.

&#x200B;

**My Plan**

In the last five years this stock almost always rose at least 30% with last year being the first time it dipped a bit. I have no position yet on this stock but a buy order set at $22.50 since friday; I'm confident it will dip following today's sharp 8% rise. You have to decide whether you want to play this for a month or six months, the weekly chart shows that this could probably shoot to $50 by end of year but i’m confident that if people discover about this hidden gem it could do it by mid summer and why not, go even higher. In any case I don’t see this crashing hard since it’s a strong company, and because it has a mid market cap if it runs it will almost certainly not be stopped by a shitty offering.

2021-05-04 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"RKT earnings options play Right now, I see a unique options play on RKT earnings. If you were to acquire some OTM call options for the may 7th 23.50 strike, if the calls go in the money and you pay 50 bucks for each contract, big fat ROI over  5 day time period.

Current vol and open interest on the call side is rather high. We are not seeing a ton of trading volume for the shares of RKT, but I personally believe this is the calm before the storm.

Therefore - I believe the price of RKT call options are grossly mispriced and the potential for the stock to move 10% or higher shortly before and after earnings is somewhere in the neighborhood of 25-40%. Historically this has happened before so it's not outside the realm of possibility. Because the stock stays stable for so long, calls are much cheaper than gambling on something like MVIS or GME (I guess due to implied volatility being lower comparatively).

The keener among you may have seen how this played out with short dated Tesla options on last Friday. The stock was trading down.. then did a complete upwards reversal, turning 1500 dollar call options into 30,000-50000 dollars in one day for seemingly no reason.

Usually I never take the risk on short dated OTM calls but this time it's different. I think there is too much evidence stacking up to the fact that RKT has something under their sleeves for this earnings call. Fundamentally I expect a strong beat.. but they could also announce another special dividend or stock buyback. This is your time to buy the rumor sell the news.

TLDR, buy lots of RKT call options expiring 5/7 at the 23.50 strike or higher. I'm holding 2 contracts at the 23.50 may 7 strike. I plan on scoping more contracts up if the stock falters tomorrow then holding through earnings. If you want less risk - you can opt for the longer dated contracts just in case the market is stupid and doesn't react to RKT earnings by Friday. Just keep in mind that the further out in date you go - the more expensive the contracts are. I guess you COULD just buy shares too. There is more upside with calls, albeit you are risking more in exchange for the increased leverage.

This was erroneously labeled as a meme stock by media. It’s not. It’s a multi billion dollar fintech GIANT and will be recognized as such soon enough. Should have a fintech like P/E soon.

implied volatility is overstated so it’s nice to have the IV for context but it’s not going to make you a crystal ball fortune teller."

2021-05-04 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Why You Should Short The Intel Fab Play Intel has risen on news that it will spend $20B on establishing chip manufacturing factories in Arizona, but this news is more bearish than bullish to me.

Investing in Intel now, is nonsensical once you consider the full situation. I reiterate my bearish position on Intel and recommend a diagonal put play.

I’ve more-or-less officially been an Intel bear for a few months now. As of late, many have asked me whether I am changing my stance on Intel due to its $20B manufacturing facility (FAB) production project. As much as I would love to reverse directions and proclaim myself a born-again Intel bull, I must objectively call Intel’s announcement as another bearish catalyst. In light of this news, I am happy to double down. Today, I will explain my viewpoint.

*The Fab Ahab:*

Ahab was the seventh king of Israel. He inherited a powerful kingdom but was eventually brought down due to his own vices and not upholding his responsibilities. Many consider Ahab to be Israel’s worst king.

Intel shares many similarities with Ahab. The company easily dominated the chip kingdom with its x86 IP, but this made Intel a bit too complacent: Easy money from x86 led the company to focus more on maintaining the status quo than moving the foundry market forward. In its comfort, Intel has lost its partnership with Apple (AAPL), who has successfully developed M1, a chip much more efficient than the previously used Intel x86 chips; failed to keep up with the shrinking node trends, currently struggling to produce 10nm chips while others are working on 3nm; and has even been overtaken by AMD, which long sat in Intel’s giant shadow. Intel’s story – to me – looks like a downfall story in the making.

Intel finally sees the need to fight back, and the two fabs in Arizona, due 2024, at the cost of $20B is the latest strategy. However, it is a risky strategy. Adding fabs to the business is not just a one-time cost of the $20B but requires consistent upkeep and upgrade costs, something more like $20B per year, which, over the coming decade, would be more than Intel’s total current equity. Intel is thus further adding operational costs to its business during a time when the company is expected to see shrinking revenue and earnings. Typically, the responsible reaction to such earnings decay is to cut down on costs. Intel would seemingly rather throw Hail Marys.

*Hail Mary:*

I call the fab announcement a Hail Mary not because adding fabs is inherently a bad idea but because Intel seems to have little time remaining on the clock to benefit from this action before it finds itself well behind its competitors. Intel should have built fabs years ago when it was still the market leader and still growing earnings. Intel could have become the go-to chip manufacturer in the US, but now it faces an uphill battle in light of how strong Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) and Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) have grown over the past decade.

At roughly the same time as Intel’s announcement to build fabs in Arizona, TSMC (henceforth TSM) announced its own fab construction in Arizona. Clearly, there is a rush to build fabs in the US, and the reason, too, is clear: China. The US reliance on Taiwanese fabs combined with increasing concerns over a Chinese invasion of Taiwan means that the US would love a modern fab stateside. That is, Intel’s decision to create fabs at this time was not decided in a vacuum; instead of the decision being a business-focused decision, it is a situation-focused decision – a decision of convenience rather than one for the sake of shareholders.

*Intel’s Fab Focus In Question:*

Intel could be attempting to cozy up to the US government with its new fabs. The Department of Defense certainly wants some fabs stateside as China’s shadow grows over Taiwan. Intel might be playing the Tesla (TSLA) game by looking for taxpayers to help subsidize its business, gaining a novel edge over AMD.

In any case, I don’t see the news fabs to be transformative for Intel in the positive sense. If Intel is really going all-in on fabs, we will need many years before we see a significant payoff. Investing in INTC now, during a time of nose-bleed tech valuations and during earnings contractions is not a smart investment decision.

And if Intel is looking for government subsidies by being the main US chip manufacturer, this is essentially a white flag; Intel cannot compete in the game of technological advancements and needs a handicap. This is not Tesla being subsidized as it forays into a fledgling industry but an old, stubborn company attempting to stay afloat via means outside its own merits. You would be better off investing in AMD or TSMC if you want exposure in US chip design or manufacturing.

Overall, I reiterate my bearish outlook on Intel relative to the rest of the chip industry. The upward momentum in Intel and its current price are not sustainable by the news: The fabs and other aspects I’ve mentioned in previous articles are perceived as bullish while they are in fact bearish."
2021-05-03 21:33:03,wallstreetbets,Intel has partnerships with US government laboratories across the country. I think the US gov will let Intel look behind the curtain to get a leg up. The US views chip dominance as defense spending people. The most advanced chips delivers the dominant military advantages.
2021-05-04 01:22:18,wallstreetbets,"Agreed!  Big mistake by Intel.  They need to make better CPUs and embrace ARM as it's the future of everything rather than trying to make Fabs.  Focus on your core competency, don't try to create a new one especially since history has shown you sucked at it (making fabs)."
2021-05-04 01:45:35,wallstreetbets,My Ryzen 7 3700x agrees with this post. Fucking shitty Intel.
2021-05-04 08:42:56,wallstreetbets,"I agree, but be carefull from quantum i expect intel to come back strong in 5-10 years so if i played bear side i would try to exit position in next 4 years.

Pple say quantum pcs arent meant for personal computing and only good on some applications, guess what application they good at? Destroying whole cybersecurity as if it never existed; i expect quantum being needed to defend from quantum and that means a big af wave of demand and high institutional adoption; then again if mastodontic amounts of money are thrown into it maybe they even get usefull as personal pcs who knows."
2021-05-03 20:47:12,wallstreetbets,"Samsung and Intel scrapped 450mm

The costs for 450mm is too much, even the equipment size is huge and the fab will be very costly

Portland d1x was meant for 450mm, but they are running 12inch wafers there

The 300mm asml euv tool is a mammoth in size (footprint), can't imagine the 450mm asml euv footprint"
2021-05-03 23:23:57,wallstreetbets,That was shockingly well written
2021-05-04 04:49:47,wallstreetbets,"ASML for more medium term (outfitting new fabs with equipment), and ENTG for long term (selling consumables).

They both crossover in to equipment and consumables but the above is the general trend. Between the two, I view ENTG as the better bet given the forward-looking nature of the market."

I also have a little PFE as I wait for their novel anti-viral pill, not a vaccine, a fucking pill you take when you show first signs of covid. They got the cure baby!"
2021-05-03 21:10:01,wallstreetbets,"Pfizer has been at 37 for 2 years, good luck buddy"
2021-05-04 03:26:38,wallstreetbets," Another solid day for $PFE.  I bought into $PFE in Feb when the RSI went sub-terranean (RSI<30), and it has had a good run. March was a steady climb, and then a quick acceleration in April riding the upper Bollinger until about 4/21 where it overheated, peak RSI 80.  It has pulled back only slightly from that - MACD is straddling the signal and RSI at 65 - ahead of 5/06 earnings call. The company has been instrumental in addressing the global pandemic."
2021-05-03 21:37:53,wallstreetbets,"Notionally I'm not keen on it, govts are resorting to force and bribery to get people to take the vaccines -- it would seem to me any ""pandemic gains"" are short lived."

My dad, also now dumb as shit, decided to stand there shining his flashlight back and forth against the wall for nearly 10 minutes - trying to see what the dog was afraid of. We go to that park every night. He just John Travolta giffed from Pulp Fiction, looking back and forth for 10 straight minutes before I told him we should go."

Dear [u/MemesThatDiedInNew2](https://www.reddit.com/u/MemesThatDiedInNew2/), this is my formal reply to the comments you made about me; your words are insignificant to me as you have called me a little b-word. I am deeply disgusted by your slanderous comment and would like you to apologize for your misuse of the b-word.

Also, I have a life outside of Reddit. I have a dog that I walk every single day, I have a couple of friends that I hang out with, and I work at Burger King. I have a life bro. You seem to be jealous of the fact that I gained some “precious karma”. Get over it, dude. There’s no point in calling me a little b-word."

But even when you turn it on max fan mode and it sounds like a jet engine is taking off, the CPU gets to like 85C and the GPU gets up there too. Like what the fuck? What's the point in paying for an expensive ass gaming laptop if I can't touch the thing without getting third degree burns? Ive been afraid to use it because 85c will obviously kill the thing pretty quickly and I actually need it for school. What a dumbass product. Makes me thankful for desktop PCs"

Lets do some backtesting in Thinkorswim and find out

On March 23 the price of **SPY 6/18/21 $320** strike leap calls was **2.50**. Lets say we used $25k to buy 100 contracts and hold until expiration.

**SPY 6/18 $320** calls are at the last price of **98.10** which gives us a total value of:

#$981,000

No TA and no DD needed. Invest in a boring index **on a dip** and you can secure your retirement.

It’s a multi billion dollar fintech GIANT and will be recognized as such soon enough. Should have a fintech like P/E soon. With the upcoming launch of Rocket Auto they will be taking over the auto industry just as they have the mortgage industry. Not to mention the 14 other companies under the Rocket name.

Bill watches John Oliver religiously. Sunday night John showed a clip of Bill and Mel where Mel gave a ridiculous answer to a reporter about the conspiracists who think Bill is using the vax to implant chips. John ripped her apart. It was humiliating. Bill was furious. It rekindled the pain he felt as a kid, before the money, before the fame, when he was nobody. The nerd who got picked on, bullied. He had big ideas but he was still dismissed and unheard. His ego couldn't take another second being connected to an inferior partner.  She made him look bad. And, of all people, his favorite satirist delivered the fatal blow.

2021-05-04 04:56:40,wallstreetbets,"OCGN - If you are long be carful. This fucker is about to plummet. 

Yes I’m shorting them mainly based on valuation. However now I’m going tenfold my shorts. 

1. I had no idea OCGN had just announced and approved yet another $100MM Capital Raise (diluting investors) 

2. In the last 3 days between their CEO, CFO and   two other senior managers they sold over $12MM worth of insider shares. The last large lots where just sold yesterday and probably will unload more today. (Reference; Market Beat) 

3. On top of of that remember they report on Friday and we all know they won’t beat their numbers or simply use some of the newly minted cash and pose it as revenue. 

4. Their vax won’t make the cut and even if it does it will be way too late and don’t know of anyone who would take their shitty vax when they have options. Look at NVAX they have been waiting for a while and the EU finally said yes but it won’t happen until 2023.  By then all the wealthy countries will have all the vaccines they need.  

If you still want to keep your position good for you and just hope you are able to pawn  your diamond hands"

2021-05-03 23:32:46,wallstreetbets,"This sub is going more to shit every day. This discussion post was deleted for not getting enough upvotes:

High inflation won't happen

The Fed can raise interest rates to infinity in lock step with rising prices to tame inflation when they want. This Fed power is far more effective than money printer go brrrr. Right now, they *want* asset inflation, which through a wealth effect, stimulates aggregate demand. JPow doesn't want or need to spook markets. Markets obey him.

The lessons from the 18/19 market tantrums, Europe after the 08 crisis, and Japan's lost decade were that stagflation (moderate inflation, rolling recessions) has a gravitational pull. It is better to risk moderately higher average inflation in the short to medium term to reach escape velocity. 🚀

Current sources of inflation are tied to asset inflation (housing inputs) and only seem dramatic in the the short to medium term. The Fed is comfortable with this because they want the wealth effect from asset inflation. This will make people feel rich so they spend freely as COVID goes away.

Also, the Fed has orders of magnitude more data and gets it at speeds that were unimaginable four decades ago. Why four decades? That's how long it's been since we had an inflation problem!

The Fed will coast or feather the brake pedal to slow down, instead of stomping down on repurchases. They've learned how to do so from the 2018/2019 market tantrum. The Fed is correct to be much more concerned about escaping stagflation."

# How about a positive LSD story? Wouldn't that be news-worthy, just the once? To base your decision on information rather than scare tactics and superstition and lies? I think it would be news-worthy. 'Today, a young man on acid realized that all matter is merely energy condensed to a slow vibration. That we are all one consciousness experiencing itself subjectively. There is no such thing as death, life is only a dream and we're the imagination of ourselves' . . . 'Here's Tom with the weather.”

Which must be *down*. Sometimes you sit up to look at the floor beneath her hair. Is the brush pointing at something? Is she sending something from her mind to the floor? You don’t know.

2021-05-03 20:23:28,wallstreetbets,"Does anyone know what the difference on RH is when it says things like ""pending"", ""queued"", ""confirmed"", and ""unconfirmed""?

It seems like it should be obvious, but let's say I place an order for a share of GME at 150 while the price is shown as $151, and when I refresh it shows the order as ""confirmed"". Almost immediately the price of GME goes up to 170, and keeps going up, not ever coming back to 150 for the rest of the day. Does ""confirmed"" imply that the order will fill eventually, or will GME have to come back to 150 for that to happen?"

Look motherfuckers, this is not legal financial advice... I believe this play is backed by strong fundamentals. First and foremost, they tripled revenue in FY20 while managing to keep expenses flat - as analogous to FY19. ROE % for the quarter that ended December 2020: 136.44%.

1. Low interest rates will be a catalyst for sizeable earnings this quarter. Everyone is refinancing their homes amidst the market euphoria.
2. The stock is intrinsically undervalued, I'll link a DD that explains it: [https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/les0ok/rocket\_companies\_rkt\_dd\_on\_an\_undervalued\_gem/](https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/les0ok/rocket_companies_rkt_dd_on_an_undervalued_gem/)

What I'm holding:

(05/07 $24.5 Call)

(05/07 $27 Call)

(05/07 $31 Call)

This was erroneously labeled as a meme stock by media. It’s not. It’s a multi billion dollar fintech GIANT and will be recognized as such soon enough. Should have a fintech like P/E soon. With the upcoming launch of Rocket Auto they will be taking over the auto industry just as they have the mortgage industry. Not to mention the 14 other companies under the Rocket name.

2021-05-04 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"My two favorite recover plays. ASO and CLNE Alright, the weekends now over but that doesn't matter for most of you since Wendy's never closes and you need to work overtime to keep losing it on Robinhood with stupid FD's. Reading this won't take long and you can go back to using your lunch breaks to give discounted blowjobs next to the dumpster to support your ""grind.""

I am here to talk about my two favorite plays at the moment which you've either forgotten since reading it in the post title or you're just too retarded to know the tickers. It's fucking Academy Sports and Clean energy. If you just spat out your fresh semen and crayon lunch then pop an Adderall and try to decipher the symbols on your screen that make up the English alphabet. If you need help download a synthetic voice text-to-speech program and have it read to you. If that still doesn't work, you are actually retarded and should go seek immediate help. Clip your helmets chin strap and text your wife's boyfriend to come pick her up this time so you don't get distracted by the moaning and macaroni noises in the bedroom.

First one, Academy Sports. Most of you unwashed neckbeards probably haven't stepped foot in an Academy Sports store because it promotes doing things outdoors. You'd just waltz around feeling guilty for gaining another 40 pounds during Covid and purchase a DD sports bra for your ""girlfriend"" even though the cute cashier knows you reek of desperation, she can even smell it with her mask on. It's okay because your card is going to be declined and you'll shamefully walk out while the repulsed cashier attempts to scrub your Cheeto dust and dandruff from the nooks and crannies of the card reader.

Academy Sports is an American sporting goods store chain. We are all well aware of the effects that Covid had on retail during 2020 and know it's been a total shit show. Academy reported earnings on March 30th and somehow, these motherfuckers blew the roof off.

 • Fourth Quarter and Full Year Comparable Sales Increased 16.1%

 • Fourth Quarter Gross Margin Rate Expanded 420 basis points over Q4 2019

 • Full Year Net Income Increased 157.2% over 2019 to $308.8 million

How did they do it? I have no fucking clue. Their e-commerce sales increased by a cool and modest 60.7%. Where the fuck did this demand come from? Looks like you guys were sitting around in your moldy basements jerking off to some other retard's gain porn while too ashamed to post your loss porn, and Academy Sports was out there busting loads on faces and you just wait on your knees and take them to the forehead, eyes wide open. (Makes no sense, you sick fucks act like getting sperm in your eyes is something you can add to a resume since you ""watched a lot of kids"") Anyways, here's an excerpt.

""While many of our categories benefited from the COVID-19 crisis, several of our key businesses such as licensed apparel, team sports equipment, apparel and footwear and back-to-school were adversely impacted and should return to normal this year. In addition to each of these businesses driving sales growth, they are all margin rate-accretive and should drive a return to a more traditional mix of sales. Fourth, we will improve our management of several seasonal categories where there are not worldwide inventory shortages, but where our initial inventory buy in 2020 was not enough to meet the strong demand. This year, we have modified our planning and allocation on products like grills and water sports to support additional sales compared to their normal trend line.

As we begin 2021, we are confident that we can continue to deliver strong results because of our incredible team, the continued development of our key initiatives, and the stronger, deeper relationships we have built with our customers. The company is providing the following estimate for fiscal 2021. Comparable sales are forecast to range from up 2% to down 2%. This is an 18% to 14% increase on a two year stacked basis.""

Okay great, so people bought a lot of workout equipment. Who cares? What you semen suckers fail to understand, is that some guys were able to find a woman that is attracted to them in a way that they will ACTUALLY have sex with them and sometimes that results in kids. Those kids have been at home all fucking year and their parents want them out of the house so they can fuck on the kitchen table again. Ding ding, those rusty gears in your seemingly empty head are starting to grind. Yes wow, vaccines are starting to become mainstream and everybody is pent up at home with their crotch goblins. Enter every single recreational sport available. Beyond boosts in kids sports equipment that we will probably see (this part of my DD is literally just my personal social media feed where everybody on Facebook and Instagram is doing anything in their power to get the kids out of the house and bragging about it) we are obviously going into outdoor season. That means camping, vacations swimming and other things people with active and healthy lifestyles do. Academy Sports has it all. Tents, grills, coolers, clothing, swimsuits, fishing gear, canoes, sleeping bags. Do me a favor, walk into an Academy Sports store and look at the demand for yourself.

I obviously expect that Academy Sports will continue to exceed expectations and I am not the only one. Show me another stock with a 100% buy rating and if you're too lazy, type in ASO on Robinhood and look for yourself. Now I'm going to get into the most interesting part. ASO has a 100% buy rating from 8 different analysts. blew away earnings during a pandemic and has amazing financials and a healthy balance sheet. It's kind of weird that it is 9th on the most shorted stock list when every other company on that list looks like it could use some adrenaline shots or life support. ASO was previously the most shorted stock on the market a few weeks ago. If I had a guess, it looks like shorters realized they shorted a company that didn't deserve to be, and they want to cover before wallstreetbets gets a sniff of it. Oops, it's too late now.

Dick's Sporting Goods is trading at a PE ratio of 14 and has a short interest of 16%. Academy Sports is sitting at an SI of 33.62% and a PE ratio of 8. Seems a little bit fishy to me and smells like a ripe vagina is wafting the room. What could these large funds know that we don't? Hmmm.. let's try nothing and the fact that they were hoping to capitalize on another seemingly Covid ravaged retailer. (Does this remind you of anything else?) I am not going to sell this to you as a short squeeze because those only happen when you have a very tight float on a company where buyers start jumping in droves while short sellers are already underwater in their positions. Also interesting because at the end of March it went from around $24.50 to around $32.00 and the price hasn't gone below $28.39. Also of note, the average 10 day trading volume for ASO is 1.584M. The entire float is 40,436,703 shares with 33.62% of the float shorted, leaves you 13,594,583 shares short. That gives you 9 days to cover with average volume if they did nothing but buy and were the only ones doing so. Do what you will with that information or go do the math yourself. To me, it looks like some retards with a lot of capital put themselves in another bad situation. (Most recent rating from a JP Morgan analyst moves it from $32 to $35. If you're comparing companies in the same sector, who would you prefer to make your long AND short bets on? Operating income of Academy Sports at 129M in 2019, 222M in 2020 and 424M in 2021 with a smaller PE ratio, or Dick's with 445M in 2019, 409M in 2020, or 741M in 2021 and a PE ratio twice that of the former?

I already know you little asshats get mad when you see a DD on a stock only after it's up 150% for the week, but this is one of those times when this post was made while the stock is down 3% for the week and up 10% for the month.

I do also want to give some credit to /u/XionTG for the predictions below that he made a month ago. They turned out to be spot on, even though he got a lot of flack in the comments.

Predictions:

My Target Prices

First short-term target price: $30 by 5/1

Second short-term target price: $60 by 7/1

​

(You can see his original DD here but I will warn you degenerate retards that this DD is from the r-investing crowd so don't pucker your asshole up too tight or your heads might explode and your balls could drop).

​

Next one, CLNE (Clean Energy)

""Clean Energy is changing the way the world fuels its vehicles. Reducing pollution from the transportation industry is an important goal for our nation, and we at Clean Energy know just how realistic and attainable that goal is with natural gas fuel.

Moving forward in our thinking as well as in our vehicles means a safer, healthier planet for all of us. This change is happening. Natural gas is abundant and economically viable and is increasingly being adopted as transportation fuel by countries around the world.""

Hmmm, I can't even begin to imagine what type of political administration or historical time (notably marked by unprecedented climate change) when a company providing an alternative to diesel, especially one that is clean and readily available, could POSSIBLY flourish. I was a truck driver for some time and pumped over $500 dollars of fuel into my semi each day. Looking over the finances, fuel prices accounted for 20% more than the cost of the 2 drivers to work over the road on a weekly basis. Fuel is generally the highest percentage of operating costs in the freight transportation business. We are set to enter into a period of economic recovery and anyone with half a brain synapse knows freight transportation is at the heart of industry. Not that this is entirely related, but Amazon just posted a round of earnings that once again, exceeded expectations. Amazon's sales increased by a modest 44 fucking percent. Why does it matter? Shut the fuck up and keep reading. ""[Clean Energy] signed an agreement with Amazon to provide low and negative carbon renewable natural gas, as 27 of its existing fueling stations and another 19 new or upgraded stations."" Yeah you read that correctly, Amazon sales blow the fuck up and they have found a place that they can cut operating costs and it just so happens to be through a partnership with the only other company that has the infrastructure to support them in this endeavor. It goes without saying that the current administration is going to be pushing for renewable and clean energy harder than your wife threw you out of the house when her boyfriend showed up with a bottle of lube and his extra thick cock ring.

Also noteworthy.

""UPS Makes Largest Purchase of Renewable Natural Gas Ever in the U.S.

Seven-Year 170 Million Gallon Equivalents Purchase from Clean Energy Fuels Corp. Will Reduce GHG Emissions by More than 1 Million Metric Tons."" Go look at their press releases if you want to see their other partnerships.

I have attached another DD done by /u/twenty98 about CLNE that was well done. We also know that /u/NrdRage made a very good DD as well so go read it because I'm not going to retype it and in any way attempt to take credit for their work. I am not sitting here saying I love the stock, to be honest, I love the company and what it does. Reducing emissions in one of the industries with an oversized carbon footprint is a home run for me. Just as Tesla and electric vehicles are the future, alternative fuels will fill the gaps where batteries cannot support. 

I don't really care what you spray paint huffing STD riddled idiots do, but in my opinion, both of these companies look like they have more potential than the current share price is demonstrating. CLNE is up 5% for the week and down 22% for the month. For those that figured out MVIS, CLOV and all the other bullshit, the time to buy into something isn't after it's up 120% in two days and Cramer mentions it. Find assets at a less retarded entry point. Good luck and go back to whatever smooth brained moron shit you were doing before seeing this.

​

That's the end of the post and that's all I got for you. Now you can return to the act of holding your wife's hair while she goes down on your neighbor! Thank me later.

2021-05-03 20:41:13,wallstreetbets,"Pretty interesting.. share repurchase near the all-time high is always a great vote of confidence. I imagine that when these kinds of secondary offerings are made, a bunch of investors' eyes turn towards the company's financials to check for a bargain - I hold ASO shares and options and believe it still is a MAJOR bargain around $31.

They took steps to pay down a bunch of debt with a couple great quarters - seems to me that a buyback is the next best choice for a company that isn't looking to pay a dividend and has excess cashflow over-and-above what is needed for their expansion plans. Most companies held cash through the pandemic, so to me ASO is signaling that the pandemic uncertainty may be behind them.

Couple other retailers that announced buybacks recently are DG and DLTR. Might want to take a look at when they announced their buyback and what they are trading at now.."

2021-05-03 21:20:02,wallstreetbets,15% in shares can bounce back given enough time. hold until NFL season at least. 40% though... that is rough but weed stocks will rebound eventually.
2021-05-03 21:20:29,wallstreetbets,Why buy all in 1 shot? Buy in small portions. Especially if chasing the stock up!
2021-05-03 21:21:34,wallstreetbets,LMAO

2021-05-03 21:40:36,wallstreetbets,I had no idea the merger actually going through would tank TLRY to almost the 30 day low. Oh well.
2021-05-03 21:41:41,wallstreetbets,!bigoof
2021-05-03 21:44:38,wallstreetbets,It’s only a loss if you sell it

2021-05-03 21:56:27,wallstreetbets,"Are you retarded? 
Why the FK aren't you selling calls to hedge your position at $65?"
2021-05-03 21:57:48,wallstreetbets,Doing great!
2021-05-03 21:59:22,wallstreetbets,"You bought tlry at 27$?!?! 

Yep. You retarded. Give him the keys, boys."
2021-05-03 22:00:13,wallstreetbets,What goes down must come up or something like that
2021-05-03 22:01:31,wallstreetbets,Gambling to gamble on a gambling stock.  This is the way.  Been a brutal 2 past months for the donkey. We're all starting to believe Wood is shorting. Feeling like we're stagnant til more states legalize.   Have had plenty of decent good news lately and it just rejects everything and tumbles more.  Nasdaq is 🔥 🗑.
2021-05-03 22:02:36,wallstreetbets,"Didn't say it did.
But then I would never lose $95K in a day like a total moron."
2021-05-03 22:02:56,wallstreetbets,Fucking retard
2021-05-03 22:05:07,wallstreetbets,Did you tell them you’ll be their friend if you get your money back? Usually works!

2021-05-03 22:08:57,wallstreetbets,Welcome ape
2021-05-03 22:12:05,wallstreetbets,Hey OP. You have 10000 shares. Start selling call options otm and avg down ifnu can
2021-05-03 22:13:00,wallstreetbets,"I was in a similar position as you, but I sold at a loss few days ago. I kinda felt it will go down to 45, but my crystal ball doesn’t work very well."
2021-05-03 22:14:34,wallstreetbets,i have a feeling this will do good friday??
2021-05-03 22:15:16,wallstreetbets,Its not a loss till you sell Mr. McPaperhands
2021-05-03 22:15:40,wallstreetbets,"If you did the DD yourself, entered at the best time, and stuck to your plan and played within ur risk tolerance then that's one thing.

The other is if you read somebody else's DD then threw 200k in which case welcome aboard"
2021-05-03 22:15:48,wallstreetbets,Just put your home on a second mortgage and double down on DKNG
2021-05-03 22:15:53,wallstreetbets,"DKNG...what exactly was the play here?

Also TLRY lol pot. Still, might as well hold there unless your wife's boyfriend needs money. They are making a few decent moves to setup a potentially booming 2021, but that market is so saturated, picking the real winners is like throwing a dart at a dartboard and not knowing where the bullseye is. Or should I say, each segment has a passionate autist with all this ""data"" and ""facts"" about why <insert random pot stock> is gonna boom soon."
2021-05-03 22:19:25,wallstreetbets,"Double Down oh, I heard if you always double down you can't lose oh, it works for roaring Kitty"
2021-05-03 22:19:39,wallstreetbets,"Get outta here you winner, go loose some more before you come back!"
2021-05-03 22:20:32,wallstreetbets,Draftkings has been so fuckin annoying
2021-05-03 22:22:52,wallstreetbets,You’re literally my favorite retard wow I had a hearty laugh here’s an award wow I don’t feel so bad about losing 6k
2021-05-03 22:24:30,wallstreetbets,Tell them your kid made them purchases and you didn't consent.
2021-05-03 22:25:48,wallstreetbets,"What made you think that investing in Draftkings was a good idea?

Buy some UPS tomorrow.  Sell it in 4 months.  Then buy Palantir and hold for 2 months.  Then just sit back and consider your life choices.  FFS do better."
2021-05-03 22:26:28,wallstreetbets,And here I just thought Draftkings sold beer. Who knew?
2021-05-03 22:29:59,wallstreetbets,"Don’t sell, hold"
2021-05-03 22:33:36,wallstreetbets,"Should’ve put it into RSI instead. Cannot believe DKNGs value relative to it, insanely undervalued."
2021-05-03 22:34:46,wallstreetbets,Your cost basis is only $66? Lol keep holding. It’s not like shares have an expiration date
2021-05-03 22:34:50,wallstreetbets,"That'll do, ape, that'll do."
2021-05-03 22:36:18,wallstreetbets,Maybe one in ten thousand or a hundred thousand that invest like this is a winner. Rather take a shot at Powerball.
2021-05-03 22:36:26,wallstreetbets,"You son of a bitch, you're in."
2021-05-03 22:37:04,wallstreetbets,"Draftkings is a good long-term stock, you'll be find in the end."
2021-05-03 22:45:17,wallstreetbets,I’m in the same boat but worse because mine is a call option and it will expire.  The only dang news about the company is from the darn attorneys.
2021-05-03 22:49:26,wallstreetbets,"That’s like the stock market right now in general 
Shitty !!!"
2021-05-03 22:51:16,wallstreetbets,Looks like a deep dkng
2021-05-03 22:51:58,wallstreetbets,"You’ll make that back. Patience sir.

2021-05-03 23:06:14,wallstreetbets,Do a covered call to cut losses. Based on how things are setting up I see more downside would recommend a put spread as well.
2021-05-03 23:06:21,wallstreetbets,That’s false. You’ve been played twice
2021-05-03 23:06:36,wallstreetbets,Nice! This is the way

2021-05-03 23:32:23,wallstreetbets,Gambling on a stock for a gambling company. This has to be retardception
2021-05-03 23:35:43,wallstreetbets,Sucks to suck. Lol

2021-05-03 21:08:50,wallstreetbets,Jesus I know right I can’t scrape together more than 200$ and these feckers are blowing 300k based on some babble they heard on Reddit
2021-05-03 21:46:15,wallstreetbets,I’m gonna be completely honest. I used to trade and stopped a while back. I’ve made way more off not investing than investing. Some people are the complete opposite.
2021-05-03 21:27:51,wallstreetbets,Yea idk why he is even worried about that if he’s dropping almost 570k and 170k. Sports gambling will only become legal in more and more states over the years. Hell I bought penn at 103 and it’s at 90 right now and I’m not even the slightest worried. But of course no one on this subreddit think long term from what it seems like.

2021-05-03 21:04:54,wallstreetbets,From wallstreetbets style investing....it’s a circle. Violent. Mean. Circle.
2021-05-03 21:08:32,wallstreetbets,I mean I understand. The gains have pretty outrageous the last year. There’s tons of shares owned by early investors and employees that can only be sold at certain times. I bought because I truly believe in the next 2-3 years dkng will come out on top of the sector and most states will be legal. I’m less worried about short term.
2021-05-03 21:09:31,wallstreetbets,Oh no. I’ll take more of a hidden office position in the corner with minimum responsibility. Thanks.

2021-05-03 22:00:23,wallstreetbets,That doesn’t drop my average price silly goose. I prefer CSP’s anyway.
2021-05-03 22:00:48,wallstreetbets,Thanks
2021-05-03 22:01:49,wallstreetbets,It was at least after the bounce at 20 🤣☠️
2021-05-03 22:03:25,wallstreetbets,I kneel before the king and offer my sword. I will fight to protect the kingdom at all costs. ( but also sell some CSP’s)
2021-05-03 22:04:38,wallstreetbets,Then why don’t you think I am selling them? That’s not daily dumb dumb.
2021-05-03 22:04:49,wallstreetbets,Awh shucks ❤️

2021-05-03 22:16:27,wallstreetbets,Lol. I don’t own a home
2021-05-03 22:18:10,wallstreetbets,Dkng. Play the volatility to sell CC’s and CSP’s while establishing a long position for a company I believe will come out number 1 in a booming sector over the next 5 years as more states legalize and they find their groove with sports and casino gambling. 🤷‍♂️
2021-05-03 22:20:12,wallstreetbets,Roaring kitty is a god amongst men. He is the shining light that illuminates my path on my darkest days.
2021-05-03 22:20:22,wallstreetbets,"Also, you're only halfway there oh, you have to lose more money and something more outrageous"
2021-05-03 22:22:32,wallstreetbets,You have to lose it all at once you can't spread it out... this isn't the IRS
2021-05-03 22:20:26,wallstreetbets,My plums hurt
2021-05-03 22:24:57,wallstreetbets,"Your kind words have resonated with my heart and now, I also, do not feel as badly. Thankyou friend. 
* trips down a entire flight of stairs"
2021-05-03 22:25:36,wallstreetbets,They hacked my phone and recorded me buying them on my camera. They are too powerful
2021-05-03 22:31:50,wallstreetbets,"I believe DraftKings will come out as # 1 in their booming and growing gambling sector. Most states will legalize within the next couple years because they are all desperate for revenue. Hard to pass up when you see your neighboring state making free money. DraftKings has the beat platform / marketing/ partnerships and management. They are aggressive and I think the sector has really just begun. They are currently probably over valued, sure. But I wanted to start a position to establish a long term gain by early next year. It’s volatile and I think and have been able to make consistent gains with CC’s and CSP’s. Bottom line I truly believe in them to grow consistently over the next 5 years. Up till now I’ve made aggressive swing trades. I wanted to commit to some long positions."
2021-05-03 22:32:01,wallstreetbets,Mmmmmmmm beeer
2021-05-03 22:32:28,wallstreetbets,Oh. Ok
2021-05-03 22:41:52,wallstreetbets,So you’d rather 1/ 292 million odds versus 1/10k. Got it. Makes sense.

2021-05-03 22:56:02,wallstreetbets,Did a guy who sniffs his gf’s socks just laugh at me? I’ll mark it as a new low.
2021-05-03 22:56:42,wallstreetbets,Agreed. It a nice quick slap of reality.
2021-05-03 23:00:03,wallstreetbets,That doesn’t add up.  But I appreciate your positive or negative? Attitude

2021-05-03 23:33:58,wallstreetbets,I accumulated my money by investing it all at once. See how it creates a violent cycle? But who said this was all my money?
2021-05-03 23:34:19,wallstreetbets,"THIS in fact, is the way"
2021-05-03 23:39:17,wallstreetbets,Yeah geeze. I’m crushed. What will I ever do.

2021-05-03 23:57:58,wallstreetbets,Well. I invested my savings WSB style into OTM calls and swing trades. It’s a vicious circle

2021-05-04 06:35:29,wallstreetbets,So don’t lose money ?
2021-05-04 06:40:26,wallstreetbets,A mix between risk and believing in the companies long term. Just had some poor timing. Oops
2021-05-04 06:43:10,wallstreetbets,🧐
2021-05-04 06:44:47,wallstreetbets,But I was poor in high school

2021-05-04 06:56:12,wallstreetbets,I wouldn’t say spare change. Believing in the companies long term helps. And having good gains to start the year also helps.

2021-05-04 07:09:44,wallstreetbets,"From saving and then investing it aggressively, WSB style. You see, it’s a cycle. Can’t make big gains without also having some big losses sometimes."

2021-05-04 01:39:10,wallstreetbets,Did you say please?
2021-05-04 03:59:36,wallstreetbets,Say them you want to talk to the manager

2021-05-03 20:32:59,wallstreetbets,"Google: Dollar Cost Average. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCqox8Mfm58&ab_channel=ChrisInvests

I am sorry if I get some of your investments wrong but the numbers dont really matter, the average does.

You put in 270000$ into TILRAY Inc and got 10000 shares, right?

Then the price dropped to 17$ per share leaving you 170000$.

For you to make your money back, TILRAY needs to go back up to 27$ from 17$. That requires TILRAY to go up 62% per share.

This is where you can DCA (Dollar Cost Average).

If you put in another 270000$ into TILRAY today, you will have 16000 new shares + 10000 old shares = 27000 shares.

To make your money back, TILRAY just needs to go back to 20$ to make your money back, **if my math is right.** Now, what is more likely to happen? TILRAY going back to 27$ or 20$? To go up to 27 from 17, it will require +62% if you don't DCA. If you do DCA now, it will need to go up only 3$ from 17$ or about 15% for you to make your money back. That is if you hold 270000 shares. Any dollar after that will be pure profit.

Now if it does go back to 27$ and you have 17000 shares, your investment will be worth 729,000$,"

2021-05-04 00:48:27,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, because an investment can be anything. Real estate, stocks, land, lumber. Anything that you can let sit and collect a reward or something that appreciates in value is an investment. So ""not"" investing being better than investing makes basically 0 sense.

Even investing in ""yourself"" as in, a business, or to better yourself, is a form of investment.

On top of that sentiment, S&P 500 has ran 40% since November. You could've literally dumped all of your money in and made 50% til now."

2021-05-03 20:35:13,wallstreetbets,Ohhhh right. Of course. Seems complicated. I like to shoot from the hip. Let’s see how this plays out for me cotten
2021-05-03 22:21:08,wallstreetbets,It's like a dorito but the feminine version
2021-05-03 21:09:07,wallstreetbets,"Only generally. In GME terms. Didn't follow the names of the players. Only DFV, who is apparently not a cat."
2021-05-03 22:26:37,wallstreetbets,"Ah, I just happened to buy numerous GME calls a few months ago and was wondering why I am now a multi-millionaire. Thanks for clearing that up."
2021-05-03 23:12:01,wallstreetbets,Maybe three times
2021-05-03 20:31:47,wallstreetbets,Congrats!
2021-05-04 06:51:15,wallstreetbets,I wish I liked that guy more 😓. But I appreciate the aggressiveness.
2021-05-04 02:22:28,wallstreetbets,"That is correct, you can only deduct the $1.5k per year or $3k if filing jointly against your regular income. However net losses carry over to the next year so he could continue to deduct it every year until he is back into net positive."

2021-05-03 20:02:35,wallstreetbets,I was given it. From a god. Priceless now I guess. I don’t want to upset anybody.
2021-05-03 20:26:13,wallstreetbets,Neither can I. It’s all good.
2021-05-03 21:42:16,wallstreetbets,Yeah. Those were still some of my favorite dollars though.

2021-05-03 23:27:04,wallstreetbets,Yeah a little side calculation would be cool. My brain can’t hold that many numbers.
2021-05-04 09:31:57,wallstreetbets,I sell them to people who think the price will go down. If it does go down I buy the shares for them to borrow. If not I keep the premium.
2021-05-03 23:13:50,wallstreetbets,I believe in it in the long term.
2021-05-03 22:50:52,wallstreetbets,July is tough. There could be a pop from earnings this week from super bowl and March madness revenue. But the entire market will probably slow in summer. I’ll probably look for September and January longer dates calls. Football is king and I feel like more states will pass legislation closer to nfl season.
2021-05-03 22:53:03,wallstreetbets,Yeah probably will. There could be a push for states to legalize before the the nfl season though. Mass would be big with DraftKings headquarters. I’m sure they’ll get some type of specialized priority. Hopefully. Good luck out there. Keep your head low
2021-05-03 23:58:47,wallstreetbets,Venmo. Solid. Straight shooter. Fees.

2021-05-03 22:34:43,wallstreetbets,"I am a lawyer. The son of an elderly client left  a 1-star review because I failed to help his mother adequately in a car crash case. 

Funny thing is she provided a photo of the crash and I was able to show her she was in Illinois actually when she crashed and not Indiana.  She was confused and didn’t realize it. 

I’m not licensed in Illinois.  I can’t practice law there I explained. I didn’t charge a dime for my time. 

1-star review. 

Sigh."

2021-05-03 21:06:19,wallstreetbets,Bahaha and I thought some of my customers were a little nuts.
2021-05-03 20:26:53,wallstreetbets,"If I didn’t own the business I probably wouldn’t give a shit lol. Unless of course the review had something to say about me or my performance. Yes, I own the business. All I can do about it is leave a nice reply with a description of what actually occurred along with pictures or screen caps of conversations along the way. Most people delete the review once you point out the obvious."
2021-05-03 20:55:15,wallstreetbets,Mitch Hedberg had a great joke about receipts. And donuts. RIP

2021-05-04 08:51:09,wallstreetbets,Tbh the only time I’ll take a receipt is at a restaurant. Once had a server add a 1 to the tip I left so I ended up tipping $117 instead of $17. Freakin dweeb.

I’m sure he did, it was built in 2003 (so 17 years at the time, not 20, but still). Asked when I could come fix it and I said I’d be happy to quote it at labor rates. She ripped me on Yelp and FB."

It absolutely will explode. You can’t compare this to other companies ER. This will more than just the expected blowout earnings. Everyone knows they have a huge announcement. Either divi, big time acquisition, something. Not to mention that 500milli block that was bought at $25. This was erroneously labeled as a meme stock by media. It’s not. It’s a multi billion dollar fintech GIANT and will be recognized as such soon enough. Should have a fintech like P/E soon. With the upcoming launch of Rocket Auto they will be taking over the auto industry just as they have the mortgage industry. Not to mention the 14 other companies under the Rocket name. A true disrupter in every sense of the word. Undervalued is an understatement. See you at $55+ soon."

I'm optimistic on RKT, but the stock is a different animal. The 5% float is doing strange things to the stock."
2021-05-03 21:39:55,wallstreetbets,"A company being undervalued doesn't mean much. AMD is undervalued. They raised forward guidance by 50% and also make billions and have next to no debt. There's no shortage of demand for their GPU cards for the foreseeable future.

RKT has two BILLION shares outstanding. 95% of them belong to Dan. They have 30 billion in debt with 15 billion in revenue. Volume from retail will NOT move it this time. The reason it moved last earnings was because of HIGH short interest then, which has been lowered this time, and a special ONE time dividend issued specifically to screw over the shorts. I don't see how the price moves unless Dan gives up a billion and a half shares as the company moves forward."

I feel it is more likely that it hurt UWMC, since by not staying with UWMC they have more choices."
2021-05-04 01:03:36,wallstreetbets,"I’m in the industry. Literally don’t know a single broker personally that went with Rocket. Not all are happy about the decision, but it was a clear choice who to choose. Rocket actively works against brokers best interests and is just generally a terrible lender to begin with. I would not be surprised if Rocket entirely shut down their wholesale division within the next year unless the UWM ultimatum gets tossed out.

In 2020 UWM did almost DOUBLE the volume of Rocket Wholesale and that’s before the ultimatum. Rockets Wholesale division is honestly on its last legs. They’ll likely pivot their focus to their retail division and the new rumored RKT auto loans because they’re losing the fight against UWM."
2021-05-04 01:21:42,wallstreetbets,"Auto and personal loans aren't rumor. They reported earnings from them last quarter.

The earnings from wholesale seem to be fairly small. Would definitely free up resources for retail, auto, and personal. 

Seems like a win either way for RKT."
2021-05-04 01:27:20,wallstreetbets,"Rocket Wholesale contributed about a third of Rockets overall volume

If even only half of all brokers chose UWM, that’s likely going to cause a pretty big hit to their volume this year. Further stressed by the fact that rates are rising and RKT retail is mostly refi focused...I’ll just say they better hope the auto and personal loan divisions pull some weight. At least they’ll be able to reallocate staff and resources to those divisions though instead of just laying them off like most other mortgage companies will have to do."
2021-05-04 01:30:36,wallstreetbets,"Refi volume should continue to be strong, as a lot of people are finding it hard to move homes due to low supply. Cash out and pay off debt or do some remodeling."
2021-05-04 01:38:56,wallstreetbets,"It’s still strong now as rates dipped. When they were up about a half point not too long ago there was a pretty immediate drop in refinance applications. As much as my paychecks would love for refinances to last all year, it’s pretty unlikely. Instead we’ll eventually hit the usual cycle of rising rates, industry layoffs, M&As of mortgage companies, etc.

Rockets strength has always been portfolio retention. When a Rocket mortgage refinances, they end up at Rocket again for that refi. But as rates rise, that portfolio moves from a revenue source to an asset. How that ends up balancing out will determine their year.

I think if they want to succeed this year they really need to build a better reputation as a lender. If you’re buying a home you just straight up won’t get an offer accepted if your preapproval shows Rocket Mortgage."

8 days ago they announce that they did sell shares. The company had no debt any longer and has raised ~550m in capital

2021-05-03 21:33:57,wallstreetbets,I've been buying as many jan2022 calls as I can muster
2021-05-04 07:32:28,wallstreetbets,"Yep. I just placed a limit order this morning for market open to  take my  10% AMD position to 12.5%. As always, they had an absolutely gargantuan report  last week and then proceeded to give back every gain of the last couple months.  Great chance to pick up more.  


I""m also using this time to add a lot of NVDA, which is now 10% of my portfolio. It has dropped a bit with the rest of the sector over the past few sessions and their earnings is in a few weeks.   


My only regret right now is that  I'd love to pick up INTC for their inevitable return (even if just for awhile), but I feel 56-65 is hugely overpriced. I'd start to have interest at 50 and I'd smash that buy button at 45 in a heartbeat. The other regret is that I don't really want  TSM, but would much rather have the Hillsboro Oregon based LSCC. I was telling everyone to pick them up a few weeks ago when they were around $34, because they're a great company on their own and seem like they'd be an inevitable target for a company looking to make an acquisition in the next few years. I didn't have the cash flow at the time, though, so I missed out.. and in just those few weeks, they've shot up  to $56. AMD/NVDA/INTC/LSCC would make a pretty strong bundle.  


Anyway, yeah... AMD is like AMZN, GOOG, MSFT, AAPL, NVDA for me. Companies I don't just plan to hold long, but that I just don't plan to ever sell unless I'm desperate for money."

The market is just rotating out of tech for the time being, with all the ridiculous fears about inflation and what the fed is going to do and blah blah blah. They'll rotate back in and those of us already sitting on plenty of growth tech stocks will just see things rise to a new high plateau again before the  next cycle.

At least, that's my uneducated view of things. My whole portfolio is large cap tech growth stocks -- especially if you count PLTR and TSLA in that, too. As long as you got time, things will come back around. In the meantime, I'd see it as a chance to get great deals that the market is too stupid to react to. I mean, imagine being able to buy a lottery ticket after the lotto numbers have already been announced...  


I took AMD from 10% to 12.5% of my portfolio on this today and the only reason I didn't advance my AMD position even more is that I took this chane to double down on  AMZN (from 10-25% of my portfolio) and NVIDIA (from 5 to  10%)."

2021-05-04 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"HIG quick adderall DD HARTFORD FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP INC

This stock has recently jumped from $54 to $68 in April, and I am expecting a similar play. 

The MACD oscillator has been bullish since the start of this year. 

- Price target of $76-$93. (I am personally aiming for $85-93)

- The charts have demonstrated a good ability for further gains. 

- Two buyout offers which valued the company at nearly $25 billion were rejected. 

- Insurance companies are currently benefiting from the pandemic, as most lines of business have a lower amount of overall claims being filed. 

- The insurance industry is currently increasing premiums and re-evaluating underwriting standards in order to limit losses. 

- HIG's mutual fund business grew as a result of the rebound in the market following the CARES stimulus package. 

As mentioned the insurance industry is generally benefiting from the pandemic. As many people are staying at home people are naturally doing less driving, and therefore have a lower chance of getting into an accident. This has resulted in better combined ratio's for HIG's auto insurance unit. 

Workers compensation claims have also been lower than pre-pandemic, as less people are present in the workplace hence natrually there will be lower claims. Conversely with businesses re-opening, we can expect new insurance policies being taken out with HIG. 

As travellers insurance is also genreally rising in rates. With lockdown easing and vaccination rates, travel is expected to increase. I expect this to be a positive impact on the traveler's insurance unit of HIG. 

Overall:

The recent large spike has reflected HIG's high quality and growth prospects into the current valuation, and with the new policies being taken out with the pandemic easing and the companies good adjustment to the pandemic itself, I expect another rise in share price."
2021-05-04 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Why I’m bullish on MVIS So, let me get this straight. We criticized MVIS for having a “large” 2b market cap and so now we all suddenly support Nokia with a market cap of 25.1b? That’s 12x more than MVIS. 

NOK Income statement for year ended 2020:

Ratio of cost of revenue to total revenue: 13,659,000/21,852,000 = 62.5%. This means 62.5% of all revenue made was for covering costs, while the remaining 37.5% is what the company kept as gross profit. 

MVIS income statement for year ended 2020:

Ratio of cost of revenue to total revenue: 
1,398/3090 = 45.24%. This means 45.24% of all revenue made was for covering costs, while the remaining 54.76% is what the company kept as gross profit.

All prices listed from income statements are in millions of dollars. Yes Nokia is bringing home more money, but they aren’t raking it in as efficiently as MVIS. Because MVIS is a much much smaller company than NOK, their differences in the dollar amount of gross profit is to be understood. But my original statement still stands, MVIS is “taking home a bigger % of their pie” for profits, because they are better than NOK at mitigating losses and covering for overhead costs. 

Let’s take a look at their D./T.A. Ratio. This will give us insight to which degree debt is used to finance assets for each company. The lower the ratio, the better the company is at using that debt to finance assets.

NOK DTA: 6,486,000/36,191,000 = 17.92%. This means, in laymen’s terms, that for every $100 of assets, NOK accumulated $17.92 in debt. 

MVIS DTA: 3,107/21,006 = 14.79% This means, in laymen’s terms, that for every $100 of assets, MVIS accumulated $14.79 in debt. 

MVIS does a much better job, as previously stated, at mitigating losses and staying efficient. Not to mention, because MVIS is researching extremely new technology, much of their funding will be for R&D - much more R&D is needed for sensors that didn’t exist a few years ago, over the R&D needed for a new phone or cellular service which has already been around for decades. If MVIS is able to have a lower DTA ratio, developing “new to this world” technology, than a company that has been making phones longer than we’ve been alive, then how is it a bad buy? How is NOK a better buy?

I know typically DDs are not suppose to take into account the comparison between other stocks, but too many of you have fallen into this NOK train that will leave you at a $4.50+ cost basis, and suddenly NOK will start trading sideways at $4.10 for the next coming years, and you’re nah holding. Have fun making 3 cents a share per year. That’s pussy shit I didn’t come here for.

Now it’s so much harder to apply the squeeze because they now have a room to wiggle. Good luck to all longs."
2021-05-03 22:11:51,wallstreetbets,"First off, Nokia and MVIS are in different industries, at different life cycle stages and have wildly different sizes (<500k in revenue last quarter vs. $6 billion in revenue last quarter). Gross profit margins mean nothing unless you’re comparing companies in the same peer group. Second, MVIS has ceased all its former manufacturing as of last year and literally is just licensing their patents to a single customer. They did this back in March 2020, so most of their revenue in 2020 came from licensing, which has little if any cost of sales expenses. If you look at the gross profit margin from the years it was actually manufacturing, it wasn’t good... gross profit margin was (including licensing revenue) only 4.7% for the 3 months ended 3/31/2020 and 3.6% for the year ended 12/31/2019. Gross margin for product revenue alone was negative.

These are frankly terrible numbers for a manufacturing company. In cost of sales alone, MVIS was incurring a loss by selling their products. It’s no wonder they started licensing their product to their (sole) customer because they were running a loss by manufacturing themselves."

2021-05-03 23:27:11,wallstreetbets,"He was looking at their YE 2020 figures for gross profit. But YE 2020 gross profit figures are misleading because they stopped manufacturing in March 2020 and solely made money off of licensing after that. Most of their revenue in YE 2020 was licensing which inflated their gross profit margin.

In full years when they manufactured, the gross profit margin was really tight, and if you take away the licensing revenue, it was in the negatives, so they were manufacturing *at a loss* before they even got to SG&A expenses. This DD is completely wrong. MVIS’s manufacturing efficiency was terrible."
2021-05-04 09:27:31,wallstreetbets,Don't worry and let's wait until October.
2021-05-03 21:03:32,wallstreetbets,"You're welcome, and learning is always good. Your intuition about the profit margin was correct, it is impressive to see >50% gross profit. People are still hyped up about TSLA, and it has around a 21% gross profit ($7,611m gross profit over $35,940m revenue). The problem for MVIS comes elsewhere, when thinking about what MVIS might have in the future and what's already priced in the market.

I wouldn't hold MVIS, I don't think it's good for either a slow appreciation or in case of a sudden rise to massively higher value, but it undeniably has a lot of attention and volatility at the moment, and that presents plenty of opportunities."

&#x200B;

So, news came out today that $GTN is buying $MDP Local Media Group for 2,7B$. This is huge for MDP shareholders who will receive 14,5$ per share as cash and 1 for 1 new shares for new MDP spin off for National Media Group. For more information [https://ir.meredith.com/events-and-presentations/event-details/2021/Meredith-Corporation-Conference-Call/default.aspx](https://ir.meredith.com/events-and-presentations/event-details/2021/Meredith-Corporation-Conference-Call/default.aspx)

&#x200B;

This Deal practically wipes out MDP debt and gives existing shareholders a one time 14,5$ dividend.

The National media group that will remain under the sticker MDP will have around 2B annual revenue and will make around 300m EBITDA (Closer look at FCF reveals that this 300m is very close to the FCF also), for a company that only has 45m shares outstanding this is absolutely huge. 

We can look at it like this 300/45 = 6,6$ per share annualized cash flow trading at around 33$ as we speak. On top of this there will be a one time compensation of 14,5$ per share giving it a yield of 44% That is insane, this is practically a steal right now. 

&#x200B;

What are your taughts?"

2021-05-04 07:30:29,wallstreetbets,"Why buyout at 10$ when the buyers know it's burning cash and will need it before it's able to manufacture it main products? Any company will just wait it out and buy their IP when the stock is back to 2$ again.

Hence the cutting down in the employee count, share issues and why this company has been 'on the verge of a buyout' for years now. Tech may or may not be awesome, but nobody will through billions away at this market cap when they can wait it out.

Besides, if the tech was so in demand why wasn't the company bought out at $1.50 a share a short while ago?"

ATV’s and side by sides are a big deal here and you won’t see either without a GoPro mounted up with stickers all on the side of the rig. Furthermore, the camera difference between the 3 and even the 7 is the difference between the camera on an iPhone3g and today’s latest.  To me, the fuck up is coming out with a new version practically every year.  Maybe it helps them sell to these trendy assholes who can’t stand to have a lower number.  I buy when there’s a massive improvement.  I bought the the 5 and now the 9.  The image stabilization made me buy it and it’s worth it for what I use it for. I’ll buy again if they truly improve it further."

Everyone knows they have a huge announcement. Either divi, big time acquisition, something. Not to mention that 500milli block that was bought at $25. This was erroneously labeled as a meme stock by media. It’s not. It’s a multi billion dollar fintech GIANT and will be recognized as such soon enough. Should have a fintech like P/E soon. With the upcoming launch of Rocket Auto they will be taking over the auto industry just as they have the mortgage industry. Not to mention the 14 other companies under the Rocket name.

2021-05-04 08:43:13,wallstreetbets,"I don’t know for sure but I have 2 guesses: 
1. People are buying houses in rural areas that currently live in high cost of living areas to take advantage of low interest rates (a 200k house with 10k down is approx 1150$/month which isn’t a lot of money for someone making 125k+ per year. I’m not in that category, but maybe someday?). And people in those rural areas are taking advantage of the inventory shortage and selling their house for 2-3x what they may have paid previously. 

2. People are relocating and buying houses and investment/rental properties because of COVID, lots of companies are shifting to full time/permanent teleworking environments. 

Again, I haven’t done any deep research, but those are my two guesses."

2021-05-03 20:31:46,wallstreetbets,One way to look at it is that Wall Street wants to move from big tech Er and find new companies to invest in...the next big thing. Big tech is capped out man. Time to start valuing the small to mid cap noobs. $60 by June

2021-05-03 22:57:37,wallstreetbets,"Being angry at a person or company for what they did in the past and then missing an opportunity for what they're doing in the present because of it, only hurts the investor. If someone lost money with NKLA I can understand the frustration.

The fact is there is a company, it employs a few hundred professionals, some of which are very capable, and it is already developing prototypes for both electric and hydrogen trucks (yes, that work uphill as well...).

Because of all the mistakes, stupidity, misbehavior and terrible managing from the past, people lost confidence in it, it lost value and now in the realm of EV companies, it's undervalued. I don't think this is a complicated equation at all.

Again, not saying one should put loads of money into it, but, can it be an interesting addition to a portfolio? I think so, and no one is paying me to write this."
2021-05-03 23:01:31,wallstreetbets,"What's a true ape? What does that even mean? Someone on a mission to fight the establishment? Someone who agrees with everyone in this subreddit? Someone who buys into companies cause they're in vogue here? 

What I wrote makes sense. It might not turn out that way, but then again, that can be said about any D/D here. 

I'm not trying to be an ape. That's a silly proposition. I just want to invest correctly and make a reasonable profit over time."

2021-05-04 02:10:32,wallstreetbets,"Ericsson’s sitting below $14. If we adjust the price such that shares outstanding are equal, then NOK sits at $8.299. The fact that they’re closing contracts left and right tells me that they are highly undervalued in comparison to their rival."

Not only will they be making business with companies like Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile, but also companies like Spectrum and other ISPs. I wouldn’t be surprised to find out that SpaceX’s internet service (Starlink) works with them, too.

Ofc, partnerships with the main cloud providers has already initiated, too."

2021-05-04 05:08:41,wallstreetbets,This is what the hedge funds are doing now. They are tanking all the stocks so people will sell off when they break even after holding and then FOMO back in.

2021-05-03 20:42:07,wallstreetbets,RKT is set to launch. Held on tight thru the $27 spike and watched my profits disappear. The time is coming and coming fast when this stock’s value will boom! See ya’ll on the moon!
2021-05-03 21:31:02,wallstreetbets,Rocket is definitely stupidly cheap.  I'm in.
2021-05-03 21:15:49,wallstreetbets,Why is this DD so sexy?
2021-05-03 20:22:18,wallstreetbets,I was in on shares until I realized just how cheap the options were. Been averaging down with 6 month ITM calls ever since. That's the good stuff.

2021-05-03 22:20:07,wallstreetbets,Imagine it selling at 3M and buying back in when it crashes. This LITERALLY happens every time. I’m selling my CLOV calls for some RKT 5/7 23C.

2021-05-03 23:32:54,wallstreetbets,Gonna load up on some more in the morning. See y’all on Mars 🚀🚀🚀
2021-05-03 20:20:48,wallstreetbets,"RKT absolutely will explode. You can’t compare this to other companies ER. This will more than just the expected blowout earnings. Everyone knows they have a huge announcement. Either divi, big time acquisition, something. Not to mention that 500milli block that was bought at $25. This was erroneously labeled as a meme stock by media. It’s not. It’s a multi billion dollar fintech GIANT and will be recognized as such soon enough. Should have a fintech like P/E soon. With the upcoming launch of Rocket Auto they will be taking over the auto industry just as they have the mortgage industry. Not to mention the 14 other companies under the Rocket name. A true disrupter in every sense of the word. Undervalued is an understatement. See you at $55+ soon."
2021-05-03 21:29:18,wallstreetbets," who cares whether it explodes at ER or not? There is zero downside at this price. Load up in case it does explode (which it probably will), and if it doesn’t moon you still own an incredible stock that is at the bottom. Win/win"
2021-05-03 23:50:06,wallstreetbets,So many of us are holding bags up to $40+.  Do you think we’ll hit this after ER?  I am lucky with b/e under $28 and will hold given opportunity costs of other names but great prospects with RKT.
2021-05-04 00:14:21,wallstreetbets,Sitting on 300 shares @ $26 and going to double down in morning before it starts to pop! 🚀
2021-05-04 00:46:40,wallstreetbets,"The housing crunch is a combination of 7-10 years of very little new construction and millennials getting married, having kids and moving to the burbs. Boise and Colorado Springs, where I live, are a product of lifestyle moves by people of all ages. This started a few years ago with remote work becoming a thing. Covid accelerated that trend exponentially. The one caution to this story is a 1% increase in mortgage rates equals a 10% reduction in buying power. Interest rates will dictate how long RKt continues this ride."
2021-05-04 03:22:13,wallstreetbets,"So ape terms, buy as soon as the market opens tomorrow and sell on the 5th?"
2021-05-04 03:46:08,wallstreetbets,"Great DD, been holding my shares knowing RKT would have its day. May 5th is gonna be the catalyst to make this bad boy launch"

2021-05-03 20:50:19,wallstreetbets,"You’re a good writer, but wrong about Rkt. Sure, everything says it’s a great company, but the stonk still blows. I’m with you though, 💎🙌. Some day,just not now."

2021-05-04 02:36:27,wallstreetbets,"Welcome back, Jack.

We missed you.

Edit: I'm surprised you didn't sell at 40? I thought your goal was to maximise your wealth ASAP through single stock YOLOs?"

2021-05-04 06:49:53,wallstreetbets,Followed your first yolo in rkt. Why you didn’t sell at the peak if I may ask? Because the special dividend?

You won’t regret! 🚀🚀"
2021-05-04 09:04:35,wallstreetbets,"Your thesis about the housing market is correct. Here in Texas for the past several months, houses are bid up and bought in cash 20-30% above market price. Interest rates, while not at an all-time low, are still very low compared to historical averages. Many of my peers, ages 20-30, are actively seeking to buy a house. To make things crazier, some builders are beginning to float housing prices, and people are still lining up out the door to get their name on a waitlist."
2021-05-04 09:49:18,wallstreetbets,It's going the wrong direction
2021-05-04 10:13:01,wallstreetbets,Bought 350 shares at 22 just now.
2021-05-04 00:18:48,wallstreetbets,It's in the name. Only a fool wouldn't see this coming.

2021-05-04 04:19:10,wallstreetbets,Me too!
2021-05-03 20:17:37,wallstreetbets,"Same thing happening in Arizona, Nevada, Utah, etc. I bought my house several years ago and it was a big problem having to compete with cash offers then. From what I've heard it has only gotten worse."
2021-05-03 20:25:57,wallstreetbets,"Yes. Middle age, older real estate investors, and seasoned house flippers are snagging properties to sell to the millenials creating zeh bubble [beer fest]."
2021-05-03 21:50:58,wallstreetbets,Idaho isn't the only place. It's happening in nearly every mortage market.. basically in every single non-major metropolitan area. Even really sorta big cities like Nashville are red hot.
2021-05-03 21:20:11,wallstreetbets,"Chinese money came to California and did that to us. No way first time home buyers could even put an offer in on a house when foreign money was coming in all cash, 15% over ask and buying up everything. Sorry the fall out has come your way. At least hopefully the Californians will take care of what they buy there and just not let compete towns go to shit. Foreign money never up keeps anything up and lets it all turn into derelict China Towns. Not sure why the hell they do this."
2021-05-03 22:42:12,wallstreetbets,"At today’s rates, a lot of buyers are paying cash and then doing a cash-out refi."
2021-05-03 23:23:33,wallstreetbets,"I’m here in AZ and we getting a lot of California ppl too. They pay cash for the house in order to make their offer more attractive, but once they have the house, a bunch of them refinance to get the cash out because rate are so low."
2021-05-04 05:09:44,wallstreetbets,This. Most of the current trends in housing are largely due to mass exodus of California and New York into smaller more affordable metropolitan cities.
2021-05-04 07:30:26,wallstreetbets,"Once covid started, Californian's realized how shit their state was, and started running for the door as soon as papa musk and Joe Rogan left"

2021-05-04 00:56:01,wallstreetbets,"Not the whole cities, just the metro areas 😛"

2021-05-03 21:39:40,wallstreetbets,This is the 3rd copy and pasted post I've seen from this guy. Just saying
2021-05-04 01:01:30,wallstreetbets,"Jefferies values RKT at 13x earnings because of expected market share gains whereas the mortgage industry average is 7x earnings

RKT can only achieve those market share gains because they are a technology company so SA may have accidentally been partly right"
2021-05-03 21:41:00,wallstreetbets,If one thing has been continuously proven in this world it is that history has a habit of repeating itself. It's already seen over 40 and will soon once again.

2021-05-04 00:53:50,wallstreetbets,"This.  And that's if the ""cash offer"" wasn't a veneered over mortgage to begin with"
2021-05-04 01:03:00,wallstreetbets,"Yep. I am trying to move to Utah.  Best of the best powder skiing, best astronomy, great climate, dry camping, best collection of national parks and other scenery. Dinosaur tracks, petroglyphs, probably some yet to be discovered. They even have a lake called the Caribbean of the Rockies (though I assume it never gets warm) on the border with Idaho.

Also only a day drive from the Pacific coast and all of the surrounding states are packed with interesting terrain. Meteor Crater.  The Wave. Antelope Canyon. Grand Canyon. Shiprock. Craters of The Moon. Black Canyon of the Gunnison. Dinosaur National Monument. Hell's Canyon. Great Basin. Yellowstone/Tetons. It's a geological wonderland for hundreds of miles in every direction from SLC. If you're a science nerd it's heaven.

There are at least a dozen week long road trips you could take going in almost every direction out of the state and see different awesome stuff on each trip."

2021-05-04 07:07:09,wallstreetbets,I disagree. They are a mortgage company who is doing it slightly better than everybody else. Why do they get the technology company valuation? Today everybody is a “technology company”. 1999 was 22 years ago.
2021-05-03 23:09:59,wallstreetbets,"lol, you're salty. It's ok. I understand, you like a stock. This stock is not going to have a huge run up. Don't forget AMC. I'm also in on AMC."

2021-05-03 20:19:04,wallstreetbets,I know you were kind of joking but I actually think that might be the case. The people moving to California seem to be a lot younger. How the hell they can afford it I have no idea.
2021-05-03 21:50:57,wallstreetbets,Shitty mortgages are back on the menu. No money down with adjustable rates. Not even joking

2021-05-04 00:50:52,wallstreetbets,"A reverse split is the exact opposite of what you would want to do in this situation. It's a bearish signal to the market & artificially inflates the stock price. This is typically done by a company's management to avoid being delisted from the major exchanges & is normally met by a selloff from investors once this is announced/put into motion. It's really an ill-advised action on behalf of a company's Board of Directors & should be used as an absolute last resort, if utilized at all. Conversely, a stock buyback is a bullish signal to investors which typically indicates that the stock is undervalued & will increase the shareholder's percentage of stock ownership, as well as give a boost to the market value of the stock once this action is completed. Investors typically buy more shares upon this type of announcement. In the case of Nokia, the proxy voting proposal for a buyback of a maximum of 550 million shares was approved at the annual meeting on April 8th. This will allow the board to repurchase shares up to the allotted amount until 10/7/22..."

Now these same options may possibly be cheaper closer to above stated date if the ETF continues higher or if the ETF trades sideways for a while. But since we aren't Fortune Tellers we don't know an exact time this downtrend will happen but all signs point to a downtrend is coming sooner than later.

2021-05-04 01:13:17,wallstreetbets,They should auto merge after two days. If they don’t call fidelity and they will fix it.
2021-05-04 01:12:11,wallstreetbets,"If they don’t then it’s because the transfer ones are on margin. If in a couple days they don’t merge then call and make sure they switch them. And when they merge you lose your cost basis, by law Robinhood has 14 days to send it over but due to max exodus they are way behind in that."
2021-05-04 01:08:43,wallstreetbets,75$ to fidelity. Fidelity customer service is some of the best I’ve had with anything I have ever done. I’m very please with them. Their UI is a little weird to get used to. But after a few days I had it figured out. Someone posted they are coming out with a new one. Prob due to them knowing apes with smooth brains and eat crayons are turned off by there current system.
2021-05-04 01:05:49,wallstreetbets,"I waited the full estimated time for completion, and called next day. There was an issue with me having unsettled funds. May want to call fidelity and check on your transfer. Even 6 days later my fidelity transfer checker showed in process. It’s when I called I found out about the money I still owed. I put the money in robbing hood and immediately began another transfer. My transfer was done when my money settled 3 days later."

2021-05-03 20:37:26,wallstreetbets,Run!  They are going to charge you $75 to transfer though.
2021-05-04 01:09:49,wallstreetbets,And in no way restricted trading on GME. And I’ll second their customer service. They love apes.
2021-05-04 00:27:45,wallstreetbets,It took me 48 hours and $75 from RH to Fidelity
2021-05-03 22:07:05,wallstreetbets,"If you call fidelity, they will most likely refund your $75 transfer fee. They did this for me for both my RH and WeBull transfers. It took 3 days for the full RH transfer and about 6 for the WeBull full transfer, both to fidelity. Just make sure if your fidelity account is cash to downgrade it in RH by contacting support.

Either way the issue now is there is too much of the float sloshing around out there looking for a home. It's not some devious market maker, it is VIAC themselves who increased the float creating a much bigger selloff than expected, and thus a much bigger surplus, and that slack has not been picked up yet. And so it it is VIAC who needs to bring out their best song and dance come Thursday to dig itself/us out of this tsunami of shares slamming us on the shore relentlessly.

2021-05-03 20:52:16,wallstreetbets,My theory on the whole Archegos blowup is that Bill Hwang has insider knowledge that VIAC and DISC are going to merge very soon. I can't think of any other reason why why a multi-billion dollar HF would take so much risk with such high margin. They were taking a heavy position to capitalize on the news so they could then dump their position.

2021-05-03 21:59:57,wallstreetbets,"I agree.  Paramount has been trying to monetize their content through steaming now since streaming really came about and they've failed.  And they've failed for the reasons I outlined in another response.  Their DRM (Digital Rights Management) is (was) pure draconian and people would quickly find themselves without a device that could play the content.  (i.e. Go to Big Box Store, pick up MediaStreamBox/DVD/Bluray player, it works for 2 weeks then it becomes non-compliant.)

What people don't realize is the absolute nightmare streaming services endure at the hands of content providers with DRM.  Which is why we're seeing a trend toward the content providers themselves streaming the content.

As DRM becomes more sophisticated and more platforms support it, content has become much more accessible for everyday users without the hassle of trying to fumble their way through a DRM compliance issue.

It used to really be just Flash Player on a computer that could handle the DRM, and a lot of people ended up on the wrong side of that as Flash Player is so clunky it couldn't really handle the graphics quality demand a good stream would provide.

I've been in this fight since 2009 trying to get Netflix to work via Linux.  Linux communities consistently said they'd be generally happy to pay for content.  But what was happening was providers were asking for subscription fees, AND THEN, dictating what devices you could stream their content on, trying to double dip by getting licensing fees from device manufactures and streamers and subscription fees from the consumers themselves.

So, we'll see.  Viacom has a shit ton of content.  Disney and HBO have shown that if you have a shit ton of content, people will pay for it.  So, there's hope for Viacom.

But, to your point, if you have a premium service, it had better look, feel and operate like a premium service.  Viacom, and specifically Paramount have some work to do in that area.

(EDIT 1)  Just signed up for Paramount+.  You are correct.  Total trash.  Much of the content was OTA content alongside ancient ass Comedy Central and Nick stuff.

I don't know.  Definitely looks like they're fucking this up.

As I look at it, what they need is a free, commercials based service that provides all their OTA content, while offering a fee-based subscription for their cable channels.

I see the question asked a lot why we can't have a la carte channel selection through our cable providers.  The streaming services have a chance to dig into that market and Viacom is WELL positioned to offer just that.

Fuck.  I was excited, but more hesitant now.  That was disappointing.  Going to go cancel that subscription before they charge me $5.99.

(EDIT 2)  The movie selection is pretty damn old.  I'm 50 and if I haven't seen those by now, it's probably because I don't want to.  And the ones I do like I've seen enough that I probably won't miss them.  Oh no, I won't be able to watch Raiders of the Lost Ark for a 100th time.  I'll be stuck at 99 indefinitely unless I pay $5.99 a month.  

There's probably a market for it, but nothing like Disney and HBO which are two premium content creators as well as providers.  

This is looking less and less appealing unless Viacom can get us access to more recent content."
2021-05-04 09:10:28,wallstreetbets,"> This is looking less and less appealing unless Viacom can get us access to more recent content.

That is my thought. Like I said, I'm long the stock again under 40, but no way would I be a buyer at any price above 50. Absolutely no way. The monthly pay streaming model can generate a massive amount of revenue and marginal profits once initial are recouped can be huge because the cost of fulfillment is basically $0 so I am optimistic about the market space in general, but VIAC seems to be way behind on a competitive offering, which is why I think the stock is highly speculative."

2021-05-03 23:39:15,wallstreetbets,"You are correct. OCGN only has a deal to do US sales for Covaxin. But since Bharat Biotech is a private company, the only publicly traded company representing the Covaxin stake is OCGN. OP listed companies, not vaccine names per se. At the very least Covaxin should be on the list for efficacy. OCGN is a proxy beneficiary so as a sympathy/related play it is relevant. Furthermore, just because a company represents the commercial side of a vaccine doesn’t mean it’s not worth trading. For example, BNTX made the vaccine but PFE partnered with cost sharing and did the distribution. But we call it the PFE vaccine and most people trade PFE. OCGN has lower rev potential than NVAX because smaller addressable market but for a small biotech that $ is huge."

Really sounds like an exciting company to be invested in, in a market 1/10 the size of the USA. Not to mention PE ratios of Canadian LPs are closer to 20 while US companies are still trading closer to 6-8PE. Also not sure if you looked at Robinhood’s top owned stocks but ACB, Tilray and APHA have been up there for a long long time, while US companies haven’t even been up listed yet... so you’re absolutely disillusioned in thinking that people are more knowledgeable about US companies in the US."

2021-05-04 02:59:40,wallstreetbets,"Not sure how this is a bubble which is a speculative frenzy of buying. Real estate is a good investment and hedge against inflation. Rates are still low so people can just borrow to buy houses. Low rates and whatever is having people leave cities is driving demand. There’s just more demand than supply. Seems basic to me.

I see two things happening. If inflation isn’t transitory and rates go up, the inflation will eat at the debt of those home owners and the increased rates will reduce demand. Or people will just start building using 3D printing tech rather than traditional and currently very expensive materials. That will circumvent materials costs and the supply shortage.

Edit: 3rd option is foreclosures increase supply once forbearance ends."

2021-05-03 20:02:25,wallstreetbets,"I dont have to believe you, I've had actual past experience. Almost ten years ago I sold my old iPhone 4 and got a MS Nokia Windows Phone and fell in love with it. I bought the stock around $3. Rode it to $6 for a nice 2x return. I believed they would come back with a strong Microsoft partnership plus the telecom technology/cell tower tech they were trying to sell and install around the world. Well we all know how MS Windows phones turned out. Nokia stock dropped back to $4 and all investors talked about back then (2012?) was how it was beaten down but worth so much more and they were going to make so much money on patents, stock buybacks, and China and European telecom 4G tech. Never happened. They lost contract after contract to Ericsson and unfairly subsidized Chinese telecoms among others. Everything you spout is an exact copy of everything I heard almost a decade ago and again, you can see the chart yourself. Its one thing to hear all this a first time and think maybe you're onto something here but when you seen this movie play out before and actually have a trackrecord to look back on how it actually panned out? Yeah, sorry man, NOK is a dead horse until they actually make a complete paradigm shift in what they're doing."

> Take a look at housing prices. You think somehow homes have disappeared? No. It’s easy money driving the rates. 

The housing market in the US is absolutely bonkers because of land use regulations. Have you ever looked zoning maps in the US:

[https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2019/05/22/single-family-zoning/assets/images/portland-topper-320\_x2.png](https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2019/05/22/single-family-zoning/assets/images/portland-topper-320_x2.png)

The pink is single family zoning. Large lots, one family only. This type of land use will never produce enough supply to meet demand."
2021-05-03 22:58:41,wallstreetbets,">CEOs are very very good for estimating their costs for the upcoming quarters.  We don’t look to them on how to fix the situation.

Sure, my point is that actual economic research does not support that inflation will become problematic. That is a stronger argument than ""CEOs are talking about inflation.""

>Austrian hasn’t been disproven, generally because they don’t make ultra specific predictions.  

 I said Austrian's contributions to monetary policy had been disproven, which they mostly have been. Austrian economics in general hasn't been disproven, but rather discarded. Although useful in it's time and retains some useful general truths, Austrian Economics has become too much of an ideology to produce any research that can be interpreted in a non-ideological context. For example, the sometimes explicit rejection of empiricism is just completely unserious at times.

>Kensyianism has been falsified however, so we should turn to the Chicago school who clearly are concerned about inflation. 

 Keynesianism hasn't been ""falsified,"" that's just a ludicrous statement. Janet Yellen, former Fed chair and current Treasury secretary is a Keynesian, as are plenty of other academic and policy macroeconomics. This just reads like someone who got their education in the history of economic thought from social media.

>You should also look at the bond markets and to see what the markets say about inflation.

The bond market is pricing in inflation that is going to be the highest since...2013. That's entirely ok, we've been undershoting our 2% target since the recession and need to pull it up. There will be modest inflation to bring us back up the the long term average, but certainly not enough to drive runaway inflation as OP suggests."

I own some on fidelity...  are you trying to buy with your 401k brokerage link? I couldn't buy with 401k money, but my regular account has access to it.

Also, went through 10 pages of tin news on Google and found an article that says a major smelter in Indonesia won't be up to full capacity for 9 more months and has been stock piling casserite(tin ore) the whole time. They are also having issues with old machinery breaking.

 Looking at how bad covid is india, I can see all these smelters in 3rd world countries running at low capacities for a while. 

Alphamin resources uses a smelter in Uganda.  Hopefully they don't give a fuck about covid in drc and Uganda.  They got other serious issues to deal with."

Wrong. If the GME squeeze hadn't been fucked with by stopping buying, all the guys who got rich as fuck on GME would have continued pilling into SLV. They killed/postponed the silver squeeze by fucking with GME. It was so close to snapping, LMBA reported they thought they might not be able to get bars, SLV changed prospectus..."

2021-05-04 09:04:23,wallstreetbets,$65 calls on a stock that was like $3 a year ago?
2021-05-04 07:29:59,wallstreetbets,"Sure, so the pipeline Mark to Market is made up of 2 parts. The locked/unfunded open pipeline and the LHFS. They have to mark a value for these populations at the end of every month, and then back out the prior months valuation. Margins are down substantially and new locks are starting to taper off as well. Numbers just for simplicity, not theirs: So if Q1 they had 100mm open pipeline and 150bps margin then it was worth $1.5m, and now margins are 50bps and locks have dropped so the pipeline is now 75mm the open is worth $375k. End of the month they take a $1.125mm FV write down on the MTM. Except UWMs pipeline is probably like $60-70B. Even if the pipeline stayed the same and margins only dropped 50bps (which they’ve dropped much more) you’re looking at $300mm+ write down. I don’t claim to know what their pipeline and margins are but I compete with them daily and know where my margins are and we’ve moved from over 200bps last year to now about 35bps and there’s lenders with still better price than me."

Insuretechs are soon to be the new way. Alex Timm has a longtime experience in the insurance industry, his Father was very heavy within Nationwide, obviously he knows the ropes. They have gained a very heavy customer base in the last quarter. Earnings are in 2 days Wednesday A.H., my guess is they will blow the expectations out the roof.
