2021-05-04 18:48:48,wallstreetbets,"**Okay I am calling this bullshit with proof-**

Todays volume for AMZN $3315 put with May 21 expiry was 354. How come you bought 200 contracts and sold 200 contracts when the total volume was only 354? Here is the proof-

Anyone can also check this info from yahoo finance.

Now if we look at the trades closely, the price was at $78.4 around 11:10:54 am, $86 around 11:24:50 am and $100 around 12:50:22 PM. The price of this contract never changed that much in 20 seconds today. Here is the proof-

2021-05-04 19:47:29,wallstreetbets,His transaction alone accounts for 400 volume right?
2021-05-04 19:28:10,wallstreetbets,"No, the option volume doesn't ""disagree that he ever bought these at all"", because he could've scaled in/out - good chance for another small dip tomorrow so he might have sold only 3/4 position, for example.

What we can say for sure is that he didn't buy and sell **all** 200 contracts today."
2021-05-04 18:26:35,wallstreetbets,If this retard faked this in MS paint I think we should be commending him. Or I'm just blind.

2021-05-04 17:59:15,wallstreetbets,"It’s as priced-in as it can be. What’s the upside? Are McDonald’s going to suddenly double their profit margin? Are they going to do some insane M&A activity? If not, it’s a snooze boomer stock. 

Also long term buy and hold? Please go back to /r/stocks , this is a casino with a 4 drink minimum.

Edit - I don’t know what the strange awards do, but thanks!"
2021-05-04 18:24:53,wallstreetbets,Probably because this is a Wendy's.
2021-05-04 18:06:05,wallstreetbets,"1. The company has been consistently underperforming. 
2. Unlike 20 years ago, there are more fast food chains popping up every year - meaning they are losing market share 
3. They sold chipotle and other brands that they owned. There have been no news about new acquisition. 
4.Previously when the competition was not as strong McDonald’s made quite a bit of money through franchising but now they are losing Market share in that field too. 
5. Last but not the least , the damn ice cream machine is always broke. There was a good video about why it’s always broke( McDonald’s has a partnership with the manufacturer of the ice cream machine , the manufacturers make tons of money on repairs- it’s a primary source of income for them) - this means, the franchise owners have to pay more to consistently get the ice cream machine fixed + customers are pissed.  

So there is no actual reason to show McDonald’s more love. They  should be acquiring competitors and building up their market share or launching new brands but they aren’t doing any of this. ( lessons of brand management to learn from P&G)"
2021-05-04 18:09:52,wallstreetbets,"Just like KO. No love, but it’s a dividend beast. In my books it’s a win win."

2021-05-04 18:01:39,wallstreetbets,Well I think Coke and McDonalds together is a good idea. There X number of stores for McDonalds. Every single store uses Coke products. Win win
2021-05-04 18:46:06,wallstreetbets,hi can I get a buttermilk crispy chicken sandwich and a 10 piece with a large fry. can I have barbecue for the sauce.
2021-05-04 17:59:06,wallstreetbets,Just remember they are a real estate company that sells burgers. I like the stock and dollar menu at midnight.
2021-05-04 17:59:24,wallstreetbets,I miss their chicken nuggets ☹️
2021-05-04 18:08:34,wallstreetbets,"I'm into $tast, its the largest BK franchisee and currently sitting under 6 bucks, it was over 14 back in 2019ish. I think it will go back above 8"
2021-05-04 18:11:35,wallstreetbets,I have some and know they're not going to set the world on fire but a reliable chug along to sit alongside the etfs and riskier stuff. Turned a reliable return each year and a dividend. Much prefer to Coca Cola.
2021-05-04 18:36:26,wallstreetbets,Sir this is a Wendys

2021-05-04 18:44:17,wallstreetbets,Sir.
2021-05-04 18:43:58,wallstreetbets,"I think McDonald's is screwed.  Like, they're going to putter along for awhile, but right now it's in stage 1 of a 5 stage slow death spiral.

What's the point of McDonald's anymore?  They're not any faster than any other chain, their food definitely isn't any better, and they've raised prices so much they're actually more expensive than a lot of flat out better options.  Like, there's just now way McD's survives long term while charging more than a place like 5 Guys or Fuddruckers.

That's not a joke either, a meal at McD's really is about the same or more than one at a mid-level place like 5 Guys.  If I had stock in this company, I'd sell it, but I wouldn't short it or anything, it'll take forever for them to deteriorate, but I just don't see any value in what they're doing.

All they really have going for them is inertia and omnipresence.  Both of those will fade over time."
2021-05-04 18:07:26,wallstreetbets,McDonalds stonk is beyond boomer levels of retard. Position: 42069 shares of Wendys

2021-05-04 18:34:21,wallstreetbets,McDonald's valuation has very little to do with thier menue. At its core its a real-estate investment. Good thought tho.
2021-05-04 18:21:39,wallstreetbets,I will hold MC donalds and Coke until I retire
2021-05-04 18:26:17,wallstreetbets,if you like the stock you should look at this as a good thing.

2021-05-04 18:56:00,wallstreetbets,They go to complete automation and increase profit exponentially
2021-05-04 18:24:42,wallstreetbets,Best thing they have going is the real estate empire no one thinks about. They own property all over the world

Did you see WSJ had an article over the weekend that lumbar prices break new records, adding heat to home prices?  This has to trickle down to all aspects of real estate... Increasing home prices should get baked into the go-forward guidance on earnings call tomorrow... Also there is some reasonably good RKT DD on WSB, but what do I know??

I am just a small investor, I buy shares with cash. I had given them money each time I bought a share so I have no idea what that was even about other than maybe they ""loaned"" me my shares instead of me actually buying them? Maybe I am wrong/uninformed, but it seemed sketchy to me."

2021-05-04 17:11:00,wallstreetbets,I’m pretty sure all Robinhood accounts are “margin” accounts because they give you instant buying power when you make a deposit. But I think they’ll only give you like $1000 in instant buying power even if you deposit more. Unless you have a gold account then you can get up to $5000 in instant buying power when you make a deposit even if you deposit more than that

When I view the documents in my account it says all of my stocks are margin and not cash."
2021-05-04 18:51:06,wallstreetbets,"Correct on that point, but I got into it wthe them and told them in 6 back and forth sessions every form of margin better be turned off, including level 3 options which is also margin, and they did make my account a cash only account."

 I had both AMC and GME until I realized one was the squeeze of a lifetime and the other just an over valued hype stock. 
 AMC still has shorts and some potential don’t get me wrong, but GME legit had over 100% short before the fuckery... use your own judgment and DD to guide you.

2021-05-04 17:16:43,wallstreetbets,"Can you please explain to me why I should be bullish about swap stations?

How many different battery types do they need to carry?  Is there a common form factor?  Will any of their competitors be using the same battery and the same mechanisms to attach to a car?

I think long term it sounds cool, but short term swapping doesn't make as much sense as we are still evolving battery technology.  Thoughts?"

Later. I just wanted to know who your colleagues were? Fellow Wendy’s cashiers?"
2021-05-04 19:34:37,wallstreetbets,"Ignore the downvoters, you have a good question that is very controversial. These are my thoughts:

**short-term pros:**

* faster 'charge'. It takes 5 min to swap a battery and 30 min to charge. In most high-density areas, swapping is better than charging, because it takes up less space.
* BaaS lowers the perceived cost of the car and helps to price against competitors.

**short-term cons:**

* battery standardization risks; consumers who prefer charging will distrust swapping 'their battery'
* battery infrastructure costs; while this can be mitigated through partnership agreements, this exposes the company to pricing risk in downstream battery/rare earth markets.

**Long Term Pros:**

* NIO (or some market leader/consortium) will lead battery swap standardization, improving overall utility and usability of batteries while still differentiating through service/battery selection. I believe that NIO management's long-term roadmap hinted at a mass-market brand that shares the same swapping configurations.
* Ad space. While purely speculative, in-car battery swapping is an experience, and maybe even a captive audience. I've seen the prevalence of tunnel ads in China's metros. This will provide another source of misc. revenue
* Dual compatibility. NIO has not ruled out supercharging. This provides flexibility for consumers. Should charging speeds catch up to swapping speeds, consumers will have a choice of either charging fresh or swapping, depending on how long wait times are.

**Long Term Cons:**

* If supercharging wins ***by a landslide, and only by a landslide***, swapping will be very niche. This leads to other cons like sunk cost fallacy and trying to catch up on charging tech."
2021-05-04 18:31:37,wallstreetbets,"Tesla was considering Battery Swapping, yet they decided to not go in that direction. Wonder why?

If it's not for the mainstream then maybe there is some merit to it. I don't see it working better than a charging station for most people."

AMD calls are making me engorged considering the merger with XLNX and XLNX’s good beat (and AMD is tech and tech=tendies).

PYPL calls looking great bc well earnings are tomorrow and I’m a degenerate gambler that enjoys a tasty crayon from time to time. 

CRSR calls also in the mix bc my brain is super smooth and some retard made a post about it earlier.

Expect this to easily hit $23-24 tomorrow after open potentially shooting back up to $26-29 like it did last time. Good time to cash in on some calls.

The call spread is closer ITM (so more likely)  vs put spread yet bullspread is offering a $.5 payoff for $.25 risk) while bearspread is offer a $.5 payoff for $.3 risk.

So the bearspread is both less likely on paper, yet is costs more. Why might this be? Either you fucks are paying too much for the OTM calls or the market thinks downside is more likely than upside."

2021-05-04 16:47:32,wallstreetbets,Lol your previous comment was about TSLA. Talk about speculation.
2021-05-04 16:49:24,wallstreetbets,"Thing is many of ""the high speculative bets"" have proven to be successful the past year, but are still down. Sooner or later it will bite the bears in the ass they didn't acknowledge the real growth and disruption many of these companies have. Not talking about all growth stocks of course but there have been many that are underrated and don't deserve all the trash talk just because they are ""speculative""."
2021-05-04 16:46:15,wallstreetbets,How did those plays go for you today
2021-05-04 17:13:03,wallstreetbets,"Not as many buyers and sellers (low volume) means there aren't as many offers, so prices can swing wildly."
2021-05-04 17:17:24,wallstreetbets,"Stocks in premarket and after hours are typically traded at way lower volumes, meaning that fewer people can make a bigger change in said stock, which is why numbers in said market phases should be enjoyed with caution.

Unlike in the 90's, anyone can now trade, provided they have a brokerage that permits it.

So no, its not only hedgefunds and multimillionaires."

2021-05-04 18:22:08,wallstreetbets,"Yes and no. People don’t recommend it usually because it’s leveraged. Also Depends on the market. There’s fees/decay so if QQQ is flat, you’ll lose money. Also there’s timing, if there’s a crash, you won’t recover from it anytime quick.

Others you can consider is UDOW or UPRO"

2021-05-04 18:35:43,wallstreetbets,"So with triple leveraged the adage of ""time in the market beats timing the market"" goes out the window. For long holds on triple etfs it's all about timing. If you buy the bottom on a market correction, you could easily be looking at a 20-100x on a 3x etf long. But if you buy the top BEFORE a market correction, you could easily be looking at 5-8 months or even more before you even break even."

2021-05-04 18:08:59,wallstreetbets,"Yes, the problem is that it's been braindead easy since COVID recovery, as every dip gets bought into oblivion. Even if you timed it wrong, it was okay pretty much always with a decently-long expiration.

It sorta seems like that trend is perhaps ending, though, so a bunch of people who ""learned this skill"" in 2020 are gonna get mondo fucked."

2021-05-04 19:16:54,wallstreetbets,When people are selling they sell at the current price until buyers run out then sell at the next price until the buyers run out etc. The price will continue to fall until there are more buy orders to eat up the sells at which point it will reach equilibrium or flip as there are more buy orders than sellers.  It's not more sellers in a vacuum but more like more sellers at each given moment driving the price lower to find more buyers.
2021-05-04 17:22:17,wallstreetbets,"Damn that’s a short expiration, maybe it will drill tomorrow"

2021-05-04 16:57:12,wallstreetbets,Why did they go up today if the stock was flat? IV ?
2021-05-04 17:30:43,wallstreetbets,"I bought 5/7 25c yesterday, already up 100%"
2021-05-04 19:17:28,wallstreetbets,"IV actually went up after earnings on covid last time.

Gamble might pay off if they post good earnings, it's almost guaranteed to gamma squeeze."
2021-05-04 15:51:59,wallstreetbets,This is with the price at 22.4 .. tomo 25 to 30 .. I will hold
2021-05-04 15:11:49,wallstreetbets,nice!
2021-05-04 15:51:58,wallstreetbets,I would take profits.
2021-05-04 16:07:28,wallstreetbets,You’re up because there’s more interest probably because of this page
2021-05-04 16:22:53,wallstreetbets,30C. !!
2021-05-04 17:02:33,wallstreetbets,"I had my limit set at $0.45 for the May 7 $24c. I believe this is where it was hovering at market close yesterday. Did not get filled this AM :(

Current value is $0.80"
2021-05-04 17:23:30,wallstreetbets,Price prediction for this week ?
2021-05-04 18:05:43,wallstreetbets,Not sure how you can be up when it's flat on the daily and down on the weekly...
2021-05-04 16:06:12,wallstreetbets,lol someone doesnt understand IV. You gonna get wtf crushed after earnings. Even if they blow it outta the water.
2021-05-04 16:25:27,wallstreetbets,"Because big risk, big reward! If it doubles again, it's more doubles!"
2021-05-04 16:22:03,wallstreetbets,👆🏼
2021-05-04 18:04:47,wallstreetbets,"Could be a small part of his portfolio.

I spent like 0.5% on RKT calls. Had fully expected to take the loss, recouping the cost by selling calls on my shares a day or two after earnings when volatility has jumped."
2021-05-04 16:51:50,wallstreetbets,what do you mean exactly by rolling in this case?
2021-05-04 19:55:42,wallstreetbets,Because this is a casino
2021-05-04 16:16:30,wallstreetbets,This man fucks
2021-05-04 15:29:53,wallstreetbets,Theta is only 0.0450. I would not consider that bad
2021-05-04 16:31:59,wallstreetbets,"I got $24.5 May 17 and I'm up 50%, me wants to hold too. But why are options becoming so expensive? Just cause of earnings?"
2021-05-04 18:12:16,wallstreetbets,It was at 18 cents yest my average was 21 c .. today at close 51 cents
2021-05-04 16:19:21,wallstreetbets,Not if it runs to 25-30 or higher. Definitely a gamble but we'll see. I'm currently deciding how many of my calls I want to close tomorrow vs betting for a run.
2021-05-04 16:56:35,wallstreetbets,"Roll up, sell these calls to buy calls at a higher strike"
2021-05-04 16:42:30,wallstreetbets,He does
2021-05-04 17:50:06,wallstreetbets,"On a $0.46 cost, that's almost 10% PER DAY!

It's bad (for you), take it from someone who plays the theta gang side too."
2021-05-04 17:20:37,wallstreetbets,Increased IV and volume
2021-05-04 16:53:26,wallstreetbets,"A Wendy's this is, sir."
2021-05-04 17:30:01,wallstreetbets,iono... i mean some companies blew it out of the water on earnings this year and they didn't move at all. Financials in particular didn't pop like I hoped. My guess is RKT will do great earnings-wise but then deflate like much of the market.
2021-05-04 17:40:56,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I get that, just saying that getting IV crushed isn't guaranteed. But overall I agree. I'm pretty torn on whether to hold my 5/7 calls on that gamble or sell them tomorrow. Probably will do some of both"
2021-05-04 15:40:53,wallstreetbets,They’re in the crypto business. Bet you didn’t know you were buying a crypto trader when you bought an auto stock
2021-05-04 15:06:09,wallstreetbets,Why didn't the stock go up??? Did you categorize positive vs negative news??
2021-05-04 17:07:59,wallstreetbets,"Everybody knows Tesla’s 0-60mph time is unrivaled, more evidence here lol"

2021-05-04 15:24:18,wallstreetbets,It only dips so you can buy more
2021-05-04 15:57:56,wallstreetbets,It already mooned lol.  It's on a different Galaxy. You want it to go to a further Galaxy?
2021-05-04 15:13:26,wallstreetbets,Whats up with the perpetual bagholding on reddit.
2021-05-04 15:04:31,wallstreetbets,Tesla is hands down the most annoying stock I own.
2021-05-04 14:52:15,wallstreetbets,Tesla needs to sort itself out been marked as massively undervalued but drops price start of the week then barely recovers by Friday
2021-05-04 15:23:22,wallstreetbets,It was already there. You missed it.
2021-05-04 15:13:47,wallstreetbets,What is with the perpetual bag holding
2021-05-04 15:00:49,wallstreetbets,Memelon Musk
2021-05-04 14:58:16,wallstreetbets,It’s worth 5x Ford and General Motors combined. Definitely a good time to buy in.
2021-05-04 15:19:30,wallstreetbets,We are retarded.
2021-05-04 15:13:05,wallstreetbets,Probably because you bought in too late.
2021-05-04 15:28:40,wallstreetbets,Tesla is sorted. The media isn’t.

2021-05-04 15:25:50,wallstreetbets,"This is how I see it: PLUG will win sue or there will be no sue.
Stocks will jump after that info"
2021-05-04 19:38:42,wallstreetbets,"It will due to the fact they’ve recently signed million dollar contracts and were in phase two of a DoE deal worth $500,000,000. Those types of deals would not be offered nor signed if the people on the other end has any doubt of them being in the clear.

That being said, I don’t blame big money or retail investors for pulling out just in case as there’s nothing stopping you from getting back in after. 

Position 400 shares at $32.15. I’m going to ride it out for obvious reasons."
2021-05-04 18:13:30,wallstreetbets,Bought at $1 and change per share and sold for $65. I literally forgot I had bought it. The day I logged into my account and saw that I couldn't believe it!! Perfect lucky timing b4 da dip.. I put it all into GME! Crazy time.

2021-05-04 15:18:37,wallstreetbets,"I believe they reported an accounting error a while ago and the speculation is mostly around that. And I think they had to push back earnings if I remember.

2021-05-04 15:43:32,wallstreetbets,I'm beginning to think it might have been a bad idea selling $MVIS @ $1.48 LOL
2021-05-04 16:03:26,wallstreetbets,How do you sell? I only know how to buy
2021-05-04 13:39:25,wallstreetbets,I am still holding. Here's to hoping it explodes back to a 25 spot!

2021-05-04 12:57:17,wallstreetbets,Mvis making moves? Why?
2021-05-04 13:09:12,wallstreetbets,I would hold tight its a winner
2021-05-04 14:51:29,wallstreetbets,It's going up. What's going on????
2021-05-04 12:55:39,wallstreetbets,It's blowing up right now for unknown reason to me

2021-05-04 13:04:23,wallstreetbets,beginning to think you posted this a little too early
2021-05-04 13:00:22,wallstreetbets,In retrospect sure. But it just popped huge as buying is coming back in. I picked up august $20 calls. Go $mvis
2021-05-04 14:11:01,wallstreetbets,Nah man we are back!!!
2021-05-04 17:43:10,wallstreetbets,MVIS is going to 100$ paper hands will sell now

2021-05-04 13:00:53,wallstreetbets,Should get in before you miss out! 10% jump from only 5mil order. That’s not even close to short coverage

2021-05-04 17:39:37,wallstreetbets,Nah dude they make amazing microchips...or uh lasers....or something good. Hold forever.

2021-05-04 17:47:21,wallstreetbets,Why is this posted as a loss?
2021-05-04 12:56:16,wallstreetbets,Whats with mvis jumping 10% in span of few minutes right now?
2021-05-04 17:55:23,wallstreetbets,Do just ten minutes of actual DD on MVIS and you'll be convinced that $29 peak was still a discount...
2021-05-04 15:10:39,wallstreetbets,Hopefully it goes past 20$ again! I’ve been holding since it went way down 😭
2021-05-04 15:21:12,wallstreetbets,"Stay strong, this will be a long and bumpy ride but the longs will win"

2021-05-04 13:26:13,wallstreetbets,"learned quickly thanks to wsb, you should always have an exit strategy. i sold MVIS @ 24 and doubled up. didnt buy much tho. imo not enough wsb support on this stock to hold and the first squeeze had a lot of non reddit influenced investors so most of them sold on the first dip after the jump. the company seems decent enough to get back to 25 but it could take a few weeks or months."
2021-05-04 15:07:58,wallstreetbets,This is the first time I held by NOT buying
2021-05-04 15:50:38,wallstreetbets,You guys just let me know what you want me to buy and I'll tank it for you.  If I buy it tanks if I sell it's skyrockets yay stonks.

2021-05-04 19:23:54,wallstreetbets,"I regret not selling when it got to 29. Even considered selling CCs but didn't do that.

Then watched it all come crashing down and went in the red. Today, with the spike I sold May 21st CCs and collected some premiums. If it does hit 25, I don't mind letting it go but these shorts are manipulating the price just like with GME so I feel it's going to fluctuate a lot and hopefully just expires worthless, because I like the stock!"

2021-05-04 14:56:08,wallstreetbets,dont worry its going back there
2021-05-04 15:39:20,wallstreetbets,"There’s NO reason to hold those 3 strikes, especially the $2 and $2.50, too much risk where you can own only 1, the gain if shares rise is a MAX of .50 cents, sell 1 hold the other.  Sell the $2.50 since you own more of the $2, and really it’s the same with the $1 and $2 strikes, the MAX difference in gain can only be $1, again too much $$$$ risked for minimal gain.  Me, I’d sell the $1 and $2.50 keep the $2 and if you really want add a few (25-50) of those.  Seriously not enough gain possible, if you had $2.50 and say $7.50 sure, not $2-2,50   Good luck"
2021-05-04 18:48:18,wallstreetbets,Great company which fair value should be <50M...
2021-05-04 16:36:56,wallstreetbets,U guys are hedgefund bait.
2021-05-04 17:00:50,wallstreetbets,It was. If it hits $25 again I’m selling
2021-05-04 19:22:04,wallstreetbets,I held 10k shares at 0.77. Sold at 1.27.

2021-05-04 13:03:57,wallstreetbets,For real. No news. Just a giant green dick on the chart.
2021-05-04 13:48:57,wallstreetbets,"Lots of shorts needed to cover this week, I think that’s all this is. Price should be around $20 if all shorts are covered so we’ll see how this goes"

2021-05-04 15:13:29,wallstreetbets,Thank you!!!!📈
2021-05-04 19:09:51,wallstreetbets,"It will be back. MVIS is a trendy bitch. It spikes whenever news hits, then gets shorted into the dirt. When short interest starts rocketing and shares available to borrow disappear, the rocket launches again. Which is what happened 2 weeks ago and it jumped from 10.50 to 31 in like 4 trading days."
2021-05-04 18:20:05,wallstreetbets,well it was way down (day after day) until \~3 seconds after i posted then shot up \~20% lolz
2021-05-04 12:59:50,wallstreetbets,"I sold mine at a small loss. 30 mins later, jump. That's why. If I sell a stock, it jumps. If I buy, it slumps. My portfolio is just bags of dogshit."

2021-05-04 17:18:09,wallstreetbets,Pretty much. MVIS does this a lot of you watch the ticker daily. They'll be huge sell orders that being the price down for days or weeks. Then a random mid day rocket like this and repeat.
2021-05-04 16:45:58,wallstreetbets,Seems to be the trendy thing to do lately if you’re a market maker.
2021-05-04 13:36:06,wallstreetbets,Feeling a little better now?
2021-05-04 13:03:19,wallstreetbets,Do you have anymore to dump? I’d like to see it hit $20 again...

No short seller writes a hit piece and doesn’t put their money on the short side of that. If the short story was so compelling why did the people writing the hit piece not put their money down… it’s as if the longs set that up to bait Reddit..,"
2021-05-04 18:16:36,wallstreetbets,"I say “right now” because this is an obvious WSB bubble. Same thing happened with SPCE, PLTR, BB, and every weed stock on RH. This stock is worth $10 right now tops. Remember that when you’re holding a bag in 2 months."
2021-05-04 16:42:14,wallstreetbets,If the stock goes to $100 the difference in the value between the $2 and $2.50 strikes is going to be .50 can never be more thus not worth tying up that much money for a possible .50 difference
2021-05-04 13:10:23,wallstreetbets,Best of luck! I got back into CLOV yesterday and then it tanks lol tremendous!

2021-05-04 19:19:11,wallstreetbets,"I'm serious though, that's the bad part.

A *realistic* buyout number is 2B to 2.5B, and thats the highest valuation method you're going to find for this stock. That comes to 13-16/share.

2021-05-04 19:16:20,wallstreetbets,"WSB only got involved because mvis had a 50% day after hedge funds ran out of shares to borrow and interest rates hit 113%. It did that without anyone here.

Their tech is the pivotal portion of the hololens which microsoft sold to the Army for 20 billion. They hold over 480 patents and developed a lidar system that is small, cheaper, and more powerful then any other available.

It only became a ""meme"" stock because article writers need a click bait title for morons.

Also what is up with not collecting patent fees for half a year while negotiating patent sales. Does that not just make your position weaker? They've already tossed $100 million out the window while having no guarantee of anything? Maybe I'm just a full fledged retard but I don't get it?

2021-05-04 16:55:26,wallstreetbets,"GME, BB, NOK, AMC were the original 4 meme stocks and they all saw huge jumps before quick falls.

PLTR was a common play, grew 40%

RKT jumped 100% 

CCIV climbed like 400%, SPCE like 200%, NIO like 500%

MVIS is another play the sub got right (~200% gains) before it fell back and is still up ~50% from the price when it was first discussed

there are probably several others. the problem with this sub is every time someone makes a good call, they feel they're a genius and thus refuse to sell as it has more room to climb. and bc everyone refuses to sell on the climb up, the stock is hyped even when its way overvalued and the late adopters buy in.

there's a reason a lot of HFs, even those who are pro-GME today, sold at 40ish. always trying to time the top is a recipe for disaster, no matter how painful seeing it climb after you sell is"

OCGN, ASO, PLBY, PSFE, RKT are all recent ones I can ID even after the GME blow up which brought in a lot shittier DD and many more idiots.

2021-05-04 17:45:38,wallstreetbets,"This is really cool, and I’ll have to spend more time looking at it!

It might be worth emphasizing that there is a delay between the application being filed, the application being published (and therefore accessible to the public), and the patent (hopefully) being granted. The timeline for some technology areas is longer than others, too. So while patents (especially applications) can provide insight into a direction the company is heading, they do not necessarily reveal the current direction due to this delay. 

I agree that a patent that gives a defensible advantage is valuable, and I can expand a little more on why that might not lead to $. Unless the company monetizes their protected IP, it won’t have much effect on the company’s price. 
Why? Patents prevent other entities from commercializing/making money from the patent-holder’s IP, but they don’t inherently create a revenue stream. So it’s up to the patent holder to license their IP or offer a product that uses their IP that consumers actually want to buy. 

As a huge generalization, larger companies (or companies with a lot of money) file a bunch of patent applications to claim “space” in case they want to commercialize that area someday and to make it more difficult for competitors to do so. Smaller companies (or companies with tighter budgets) more strategically pursue patents for things they plan to commercialize."

2021-05-04 18:28:28,wallstreetbets,"Did no one actually read the article? It literally says the exact opposite of what you all are claiming...

She is trying to justify increases in spending on infrastructure despite the fact that its possible some mild inflation might occur.

>Even though the additional spending is relatively small relative to the size of the economy, it could cause some very modest increases in interest rates.

>But these are investments our economy needs to be competitive and to be productive. I think our economy will grow faster because of them

She is saying the spending, even though small, could possibly cause some inflation in which would justify **very modest** increases in interest rates. She is justifying the spending by saying it won't cause an inflation issue.

Then she goes on to say about raising interest rates:

>**It’s not something I’m predicting or recommending**

The article then says this:

>Yellen has said she is largely **not concerned about inflation becoming a problem**, though she has added that there are tools to address it should that happen.

She is NOT predicting inflation or saying interest rates are rising. She is saying that we need to spend more money on government investing even **IF** it causes inflation, because it will be easy to deal with by slightly raising interest rates. 

You guys need to learn to read more than just the headline.

Here is the reuters headline:

**U.S Treasury's Yellen downplays inflation, rate hike concerns**

https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-treasury/u-s-treasurys-yellen-downplays-inflation-rate-hike-concerns-idUSW1N2HO04W"
2021-05-04 18:04:23,wallstreetbets,"She's hinting at the Fed and the market because Jerome and the Fed cannnot reverse course too soon after saying inflation fears are transitory and wouldn't raise interests for 2021.  It came to the point that near 0 interest levels don't help the majority of working people, and if Powell waits until full employment like he was saying, this bubble will only get bigger and bigger. People were spending their free money especially in speculative markets (coins, speculative stocks). Just look at WSB growth numbers this year and GME. Do you think GME saga could happened if we were in a recession? Probably not.  It has gotten to the point where speculative money dominates the market, and the suits are following the same thing.  This greed, especially with big money coming in, caused bubble and it will pop eventually. I believe once the speculative money dies out (probably due to rising interest rates/policy change (tax hike, restriction on coins, etc), you will see a stock market crash as well"

Interest rates go up. Stock prices go down. 

The real problem is if too many poor people are working and have savings, then they say the economy is ""overheating"" because now companies need to pay more for workers and have higher inputs leading to higher prices paid at the store. 

The rich want to keep us poor."

2021-05-04 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"AMD: An explanation on merger arbitrage and how to play it for big gains I read long and boring white papers from really smart people so you apes don't have to. Here's the gist.

**Background:** AMD expected 37% growth this year but in Q1 revised it to 50% growth. Meanwhile, Intel expects -1% growth. Analysts continually upgrade AMD to Buy increasing price targets. The current medium target is $106 with a high of $135, the stock is at $77. Why is it so low and not moving?

**Merger Arbitrage:** In October of last year AMD announced it was acquiring XLNX in an all-stock fixed ratio deal. That is, 1.72 shares of AMD for every 1 share of XLNX. This action immediately kicks off hedge fund arbitrageurs to do their thing. For the smooth brainers, Arbitrage is the trading of the same asset on different mediums to profit from the difference (I had to look it up too). 

After merger announcement, XLNX jumped to a share ratio of \~1.55, about 10% off of the 1.72 final merger price. The 10% difference is there because of the possibility the deal will not actually close. Arbitrageurs aim to profit from this difference.

&#x200B;

[https:\/\/public.tableau.com\/profile\/upndown#!\/vizhome\/XilinxAMDSharePriceRatio\_16114624177710\/XilinxAMDSharePriceRatio](https://preview.redd.it/wvsnql2p64x61.png?width=1184&format=png&auto=webp&s=21b19380ad8d798a8e2c8c6d8736d97714c553cd)

In an all-stock fixed ratio merger, the hedge fund playbook is to short sell the acquiring stock, AMD, and buy the stock being acquired, XLNX. For example, they will short 1M AMD stock and buy 580k XLNX stock. They will then hold these positions until the acquisition closes, where the 580k XLNX turns into 1M AMD and then they cover their short position, pocketing the 10% price difference. So long as the deal goes through, the profits are locked in and guaranteed with this strategy, no matter how the market moves.

&#x200B;

[https:\/\/papers.ssrn.com\/sol3\/papers.cfm?abstract\_id=2230048](https://preview.redd.it/gi31myc384x61.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=46b1036b008d8c9fea2f74996f7e3c5cf70410e2)

What sucks about this is that all the short selling always causes the acquirer stock to go down. That's what's happening to AMD. AMD's daily volume is \~50M with 20% of it being short selling. Hedge funds know people like AMD so they can play another game on top of the arbitrage which is to shoot for Max Pain. Not to be confused with the awesome video game series. Max Pain is when they can get the price of a stock to the point where the most option holders lose the most money. Meaning no matter if you bought calls or puts, you lose, they win. 

So how does one win? I wouldn't recommend doing what they do because there's the potential for unlimited loss if the merger falls through. But once the merger is complete, the short selling stops and the stock normalizes. In the case of AMD, normal is 25% above the current price, that's going to be a huge jump.

&#x200B;

[https:\/\/papers.ssrn.com\/sol3\/papers.cfm?abstract\_id=2230048](https://preview.redd.it/xijh87hfb4x61.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc144da8bbba46b37ddb59f18d306bbad6104599)

I think the safe play would be to buy XLNX stock, so one gets the \~10% discount, and buy LEAPS on AMD (long calls expiring after the merger). 

For example, if one buys AMD calls at a $80 strike expiring in June 2022 for $12, if the stock were to merely normalize to $106 at the end of the year after the merger, the options would be worth $26, an easy 110% profit.

The other, more riskier option, is to buy AMD options expiring throughout the year, hoping the negative pressure of the short selling arbitrage stops before the merger. This can happen if XLNX shares get too close to the 1.72 ratio, then arbitrage doesn't work and the short selling stops which will push AMD higher. Or if AMD shares jump huge suddenly, which can happen on some amazing news, or if AMD decides to offer dividend payments, or especially if the deal falls through, which will force hedge funds to cover early, thus pushing the stock even higher all at once, to the moon.

Either way, this negative pressure from arbitrage short selling has an end date. The fundamentals are so good, one could bet on it.

Disclaimer: This is not financial advice. I don't really know what I'm doing. But I like the stock.  
Positions: I'm doing both strategies and own AMD shares and call options spread across this year and next year. I also own XLNX shares."

2021-05-04 15:05:42,wallstreetbets,The bottom will be around 72 as xlnx doesn't move much under 124. They have calls on xlnx so they will want xlnx to increase after the earnings today. Amd will follow xlnx linearly until the acquisition.

2021-05-04 15:40:41,wallstreetbets,"YES! Buy low, sell high. This is the low. The high could be in Jan 2022, or it could be next week. But, based on support around 75, anything under $80 is a good price to get in at."
2021-05-04 12:18:26,wallstreetbets,""" Current shareholders of AMD own less of the company now. That’s simply a fact. ""

What you're not seeing is the share dilution will be equal to the acquisition. So once the merger is complete the value should more or less be the same.  

It's like borrowing money to build an extension to your house. Yes, you pick up greater debt but that debt goes into the value of the house. So sure, on the surface it looks like a loss for current shareholders if you don't include the value of the acquisition to the acquiring company but that would be an oversight.

&#x200B;

Just my $0.02"
2021-05-04 13:03:01,wallstreetbets,"Correct, current share holders will own less % of AMD but also more % of XLNX after merger. If XLNX does end up adding value to AMD, revenue growth should also increase."

2021-05-04 16:23:04,wallstreetbets,My position was roughly the same. So I bought more today and now it's 81.48. when the inevitable 100plus run happens you'll be a happy ape.

2021-05-04 16:54:15,wallstreetbets,Because each share of XLNX is worth 1.7 shares of AMD. 1.72 shares of AMD is currently worth about $135. Pretty close to the price of XLNX

2021-05-04 18:43:49,wallstreetbets,"Accept some loss and diversify to leaps or hold diamond hands to the grave. It **could** jump by then but it **will** jump after December when the merger closes, imo. What's your risk tolerance?"
2021-05-04 18:45:40,wallstreetbets,China and EU have not agreed to the merger yet. But risk seems low. The market is pricing in a 7% risk of it not going through at the moment based on Arb gap

2021-05-04 19:59:28,wallstreetbets,It is a magic code that opens up the doors to paradise to those who ask this question
2021-05-04 15:14:33,wallstreetbets,He’s clearly on pace to retire 40-50. That’s early retirement and still has some prime years left. Most people work till they’re 70 and then die without enjoying any retirement
2021-05-04 10:52:58,wallstreetbets,Only 2000% more to go to give you that retirement
2021-05-04 11:55:51,wallstreetbets,Bro you can retire but not with that amount in the USA.You would have to go to a 3rd world country like Columbia or Dominican Republic were the average income is no more then 600$ a month .Rent is a 50$-400$ depending on how many bedrooms. With over a 100 Grand in a 3rd world country your consider a millionair .
2021-05-04 11:09:20,wallstreetbets,Not sure if you have left your house after buying AAPL. You can't retire with 133k USD in USA even if you live in the Midwest.

2021-05-04 12:17:27,wallstreetbets,"yeah i don't have a wife or kids, if you need to support them all i would say at least 200k"
2021-05-04 19:03:12,wallstreetbets,Ya I can. You assume he held 20k of apple shares and that’s it?! No other stocks ever? Crazy af.
2021-05-04 17:19:44,wallstreetbets,That cost average is sick though.
2021-05-04 19:28:51,wallstreetbets,How much will he have in 2130?
2021-05-04 19:14:54,wallstreetbets,If you're calculating 8% a year you might as well sell it and go with SPY.  Then you're pretty close to the index and you still get dividends from it.

2021-05-04 12:40:04,wallstreetbets,Yes

2021-05-04 11:01:08,wallstreetbets,It’s about streams of income not a jackpot crazy gain this guy is sitting on a great average and will probably hit 300k by 2030 not to mention apples increasing dividends with your mindset you will only lose money

2021-05-04 11:16:36,wallstreetbets,"Typical recommendation to be able to survive a 30-year retirement is a 4% withdrawal rate.  So, you basically need ~25x your annual spending rate (which usually increases when you retire since you need to pay for things like health insurance that your employer covered) invested in retirement to make it.  I suspect he'll have more than 300k invested by 2030, but if we used that number, he could only be spending $12k/year to make it work.

2021-05-04 15:09:28,wallstreetbets,She is not seeking spousal support. Remember they have been together for almost 30 years. Better to split on ammicable grounds and keep the toxicity out of it
2021-05-04 11:44:11,wallstreetbets,I meant 300k solely in his apple position as only one of multiple streams of income
2021-05-04 11:42:21,wallstreetbets,How does spending increase when you retire? Assume your house and vehicles are paid off I don't see how your spending would increase tbh.
2021-05-04 12:01:47,wallstreetbets,"Got it.  This guy seems like he's all in on Apple thus far, but perhaps he's diversifying."
2021-05-04 11:49:18,wallstreetbets,"How would they not increase if someone retires early?

What's your logic behind it"
2021-05-04 11:54:22,wallstreetbets,"I just mentioned one reason.  Healthcare.  Right now, my employer pays for my healthcare.  To get equivalent healthcare, I'd need to be paying $30k/year.  If my current spending rate (outside of paying for daycare which won't be happening when I retire) is ~$35k/year (house and car are already paid off), I'm instead looking at ~$65k/year the instant I retire.  And health insurance costs (plus any out of pocket medical costs) also tend to increase as you age.

I guess if you're looking for other reasons, some people start investing more time in hobbies upon retirement with their newfound free time, and thus spend more money on those hobbies.  This will be highly dependent on the person though.

Edit:  Anyone genuinely interested in this type of discussion and interested in retiring early, I recommend r/financialindependence to learn more.  There is a lot of good information there.  But their investment advice vastly differs from r/WSB , lol."
2021-05-04 12:32:23,wallstreetbets,Lol hopefully
2021-05-04 11:53:36,wallstreetbets,Where did I say anything about early retirement? The post I replied to said nothing about early retirement. He simply said spending goes up when you retire. In which case he mentions healthcare. I was curious if that's all he meant by spending going up
2021-05-04 16:21:35,wallstreetbets,"Pre-retirement all my money goes towards investments, post-retirement I’ll stop investing and start withdrawing...."
2021-05-04 17:30:12,wallstreetbets,"no expenses related to commuting, working, less eating out as you have more time to cook, more time to bargain hunt. Assuming mortgages and debt are paid off and kids are moved out you really only have food and hobby spending with some regular misc categories.

Typically spending decreases in retirement however, of course you CAN spend more if thats what you want to do but most people spend less."
2021-05-04 12:06:47,wallstreetbets,It still blows my mind when something reminds me that Americans don’t get free healthcare. What a complete fucking shit hole. And the turkeys keep voting for more Christmas.
2021-05-04 11:56:07,wallstreetbets,30k a year for insurance? at that rate you might as well have a $10k deductible and pay lower premiums
2021-05-04 12:55:14,wallstreetbets,"This is what your employer tells you they pay. If you shop the market, you'll quickly realize it's not that accurate. For a family of 5 to get the same coverage as through my spouse's employer, the market based on our current income would be more around 10k a year or less, with the same deductibles. His employer says their cost share is 27k. Clearly not that accurate. If our income went down, that cost would go down for market insurance."
2021-05-04 18:06:39,wallstreetbets,Laughs in EU
2021-05-04 13:00:19,wallstreetbets,"Costs go up, inflation goes up, and healthcare on its own is good enough without those things."
2021-05-04 16:32:18,wallstreetbets,"Exactly, so expenses go up, it's the opposite."
2021-05-04 12:09:01,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, it definitely makes things like early retirement harder since you need to plan for potentially bad health outcomes.

Conversely though, typically tax rates are lower than other countries; if you're prudent with saving/investing, you can still come out with enough extra money to compensate for the healthcare issue."
2021-05-04 12:03:02,wallstreetbets,"I totally agree.  I don't decide what insurance my company does though (note: this is also the price for a family of 4).

Anyways, even a plan with a higher deductible is still an increase in spending.  The one place you may decrease your spending in retirement is transportation--less commuting means less gas, maintenance, depreciation, buying new cars, etc.  It's possible to decrease spending in retirement, but I think it's far less likely than increasing, based on what I've read."
2021-05-04 13:03:48,wallstreetbets,"They are paying that amount.  We have a Gold plan, and they are [required by law to pay at least 80% of it as a large employer](https://www.ncsl.org/research/health/small-business-health-insurance.aspx).  Based on the current premiums I'm paying, they'd absolutely be paying over $30k.

>The offered insurance must meet the minimum essential coverage (MEC) requirement, defined as ""Bronze level"" where the health insurer plan will pay at least 60 percent of the cost of each health service or treatment; higher levels of coverage include ""Silver"" with 70% insurer payment, ""Gold"" at 80% insurer payment and ""Platinum"" at 90% are permitted.

You certainly may be correct that there may be cheaper options available on the open market with similar coverage, though."
2021-05-04 13:22:19,wallstreetbets,I see so what you're saying is 401ks are for the poors and I should buy TSLA 1/23 3000C and keep rolling it out until retirement?
2021-05-04 17:58:02,wallstreetbets,"I consider my investments as “spending” right now. It’s not money I “have” as in money I can use to buy a jet ski or something. If I withdraw exactly a pre-retirement paycheck every two weeks post-retirement, I’m not just gunna turn around and put half of it into investments like I do now. So, the “expense” of investing will be cut drastically in retirement. Then perhaps mortgage is gone as well.

My point is that right now I need to earn a lot more than I spend on goods and services - so I can invest for retirement - in retirement that won’t be the case."
2021-05-04 12:15:46,wallstreetbets,"But only if you're top 20% income maybe. Below that the lower tax rate is as helpful as a glass of water is for fighting forest fires.

Also out healthcare is hilariously expensive compared to everywhere else in absolute terms."
2021-05-04 12:18:33,wallstreetbets,"Yeah but we didn’t introduce free healthcare for the people who were already wealthy... The USA ‘low tax environment’ by design impoverishes those on low incomes and enriches the already obscenely wealthy. The people of other nations have revolted over far less, but somehow Americans have been persuaded that they live in the best of all possible shit holes. Greatest swindle of all time."
2021-05-04 12:05:57,wallstreetbets,"Yea I guess my point was if youre spending 30k to have a $500 deductible or no deductible seems kind of pointless. I look at retirement as you trade your mortgage in for healthcare. If you have both when you retire, godspeed you will be eating ramen"
2021-05-04 12:58:46,wallstreetbets,Couldn't agree more.
2021-05-04 12:57:43,wallstreetbets,"I completely agree.  I am lucky that my wife and I are frugal and in high-paying jobs (due to the privilege of growing up in upper-middle class families), so we have done what we can to work our way up in this system.  I'd still be totally OK with the system changing and benefitting lower incomes."
2021-05-04 17:17:17,wallstreetbets,"Agree partly ,   But why the fuck should lazy fuckers who don't want to work because some stupid ass country give them free money ( dole ) / free NHS / school meals / free pair of tits for some small tits bitches , Basically get more than the people who work? Or and free to any fucker who comes to UK .. That's fair for us hard workers ? , I agree with US paying for healthcare  .. too many fucking handouts in the UK to make it only slightly better to work."
2021-05-04 12:10:44,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I understand your points, they're valid."
2021-05-04 12:16:48,wallstreetbets,Then the ramen diet causes health complications. Self fulfilling prophecy.

2021-05-04 11:54:02,wallstreetbets,"Oh my.....
On the bright side, you are still richer than when I was 22."
2021-05-04 12:22:10,wallstreetbets,"Follow the math:  you’re in at ~$21, current prices ~$12.50, down $8.50.  You obviously feel the shares are going to go up, so here goes:

You SELL 73 (or as much as you want to try, 50?) June 4 $12.50 CALLS and collect ~$7600, you also SELL the August 20 $10 PUT collecting ~$11,000 so you bring in $18,500.  Now you hold your shares with 2 option short posns. One covered the other (Put) naked but limited risk.

Scenarios 
1. Stock moves up to ???  $20
You KEEP the $11,000
You must sell your shares at $12.50 getting $91,250 minus the premium you Rec’d of $18,500 from puts.  Your net loss $47,500 which gives you the ability to take the loss and deduction but also allows you to buy it back at a much lower cost basis OR temporarily buy calls OR sell puts to reestablish the posn.

2. Shares drop to $7.50, you still receive the same $18,500 and u must BUY the shares at $10 (strike price of the puts) on August 20, ~60 days later with a net cost of $75,000-$18,500=$56,500 a net cost of ~$7.75/share.  


$157,000 + $75,000= $232,000  - $18,500 + $100,000 =  $113,500   New cost per share after all trades settle is $15.50 down from $21 and you still hold the same number of shares 7300 with the ability to hold or $$$ but if you are correct and the stock does go up you’ll make more due to $6 lower cost, it reads complicated but it’s not if you write numbers and do math in chronological order.  If you feel the shares will move up $3-$4 points before June 4, 30 days, this isn’t the perfect scenario for you, any other share price it’s good."
2021-05-04 11:39:36,wallstreetbets,"I respect your decision but strongly disagree.  In my 40 years doing this I’ve learned the “cockroach theory” is right way more than wrong, are u open to a couple of choices to keep your shares and greatly reduce your cost basis?  I mean quite a bit with actually less risk?  If so let me know and I’ll share with you, then up your you what you decide to do. 

BTW, The Cockroach Theory is that when a company puts out bad, really bad news it’s like cockroaches you know there are many more than the 1 you see"
2021-05-04 11:48:07,wallstreetbets,"Don’t know if you had access to read this from last week, also notice BOTH changed their price target to $10.  I don’t put much, if any credence to analysts but the $10 is relevant to my suggestion 



Things are getting tougher for electric-vehicle start-ups. Stock prices have come down. One analyst sees more downside because competition in the EV space is ramping up. 

Goldman Sachs analyst Mark Delaney downgraded Fisker (ticker: FSR) stock to Sell from Hold. His price target goes to $10 a share from $15. 

Fisker stock is off 4.42% to $14.48 in Thursday morning trading. 

Fisker stock has had a brutal few weeks. It wasn't that long ago when the shares were trading at almost $32 each, shortly after the company announced plans for a second model to be built by Foxconn. 

Fisker's first vehicle, the Ocean SUV, is being built by Magna International (MGA) and is due in late 2022. 

That timing for Fisker's vehicles isn't optimal for Delaney, and one of the problems he has with the stock. ""We are incrementally concerned about what we believe is the company's late time to market,"" wrote the analyst in a Wednesday report. He sees competition increasing. 

Delaney counts more about a dozen all-electric SUVs that should be available in the U.S. before the Ocean hits the market. What's more, he sees traditional auto makers ramping up their focus on EVs. General Motors (GM), for instance, has committed to launch 30 new all-electric vehicles by 2025. 

That won't be the only source of competition. Big tech might get involved. Apple (AAPL) is reportedly looking to produce an Apple-branded autonomous, electric vehicle. Also, Baidu (BIDU) is partnering with Chinese car maker Geely, and Xiaomi has announced plans to invest $10 billion in EVs. 

It's all too much for Delaney to keep even a Hold rating on Fisker. He also cut his rating on Lordstown Motors (RIDE) to Hold from Buy, and cut the price target to $10 from $21."

2021-05-04 11:42:57,wallstreetbets,"I'm always open to listening to other perspectives, though not particularly interested in anything with an expiration.

As for Fisker, there hasn't even actually been any bad news. At least that the public is aware. This is an entirely new entity than the old Fisker Automotive."
2021-05-04 11:55:19,wallstreetbets,"I saw that but that is just an analyst changing his perspective, that isn't news on the company. Adam Jonas (Morgan Stanley) reiterated that he disagrees and sees Fisker as the best case.

Regardless neither analysts opinion mean anything to me, strictly the fundamentals on the company. There has and always will be competition but Fisker's:

1. valuation is too low compared to other EVs / cash reserves
2. car is too attractive
3. costs are too low

to ignore. Maybe I am underestimating competition though, clearly I am already down immensely so maybe there is something I am missing. Oh well. We'll see I guess."
2021-05-04 12:26:42,wallstreetbets,"When investing you should always look at worst case not only best case, that can help you miss land mines, you sound convinced the shares are cheap and any variation of that is wrong.  I’ve done that before and been 100% right and very well paid, but that’s the exception not rule.  Either way I do hope the shares hit $25 and your confidence is well rewarded, just don’t put blinders on IF the $150k matters, it could be your play money and a drop isn’t relevant 

Good luck"

2021-05-04 10:54:01,wallstreetbets,"I think this is a great move. The sell off today is primary from the news of insiders selling 1.3 million shares yesterday. These sells were all preplanned months ago, and not likely some shady mass sell off prior to bad news..

In fact, I think we’ve got some great news upcoming. Possibly during the 5/7 “business update” call? OCGN has applied for EUA with the FDA. 

Previous sells from the CEOs of BOTH Moderna and pfizer came weeks before the announcement of receiving the EUA:

2021-05-04 15:28:08,wallstreetbets,What earning ? lol they have zero earnings . No revenue for years.
2021-05-04 11:10:02,wallstreetbets,"9:10 times when company releases their Q results it will drop. If they would say that Covaxin would get permission that could be another story but I'll doubt it. I would've waited at end of the Friday or Monday but you do you.

2021-05-04 15:17:28,wallstreetbets,"From the comments, it doesn't look like they think it was a good play.   


WSB is not known for backing GOOD plays either though so take it with a grain of salt.   


1) Your buy-in price isn't bad. $53.64 is already profitable today ($54 at time of post).   


2)You are \~33$ below ATH, which does give you visible upside.   


3)It is doubtful Twitter would fall too much lower quickly from where it is at.   


Do I think this is a good play? No.   


However, it is not the worst one I have seen so far. Taking a 2nd mortgage on your house (if true) for Twitter is pretty stupid BUT you bought shares and not options so you will be able to save value (probably).   


Honestly, there are WAY better plays out there for a YOLO. TWTR really hasn't done much since debut, their PPC is not as cost-effective as rival platforms, and companies are worried about the toxic content so are wary of advertising.   


In the end, it is not as bad as the forum comments would make it out to be.   


If I were to YOLO (and I do) I would go for something like the Proterra/Arclight merger (buy shares but 6/18 call options are for the REAL tendies.....and losses).   


Even a play on UWMC (or RKT if you are a RKT bro).   


Honestly, MSFT would be where I YOLO'ed something as important as a house refinance. Stable and will be worth a FORTUNE in a few years thanks to Cloud and cloud gaming."

2021-05-04 17:29:00,wallstreetbets,Twitter has realized no gains since IPO why would you even bother with a stock like this. There business model barely makes any money.
2021-05-04 17:29:35,wallstreetbets,"hope your short, the chart has been horrible, and stock has been way overvalued"
2021-05-04 17:33:33,wallstreetbets,"This is hilariously dumb. Not even a meme stock, just throwing some people's salary at a company not even interesting enough to start Q anon or some shit"
2021-05-04 17:34:09,wallstreetbets,"Probably wouldn’t take equity out of a house for this, but it’s not like mega stupid, stock hasn’t done much since IPO but it will probably move higher eventually. And at least it’s shares and not options. Godspeed"
2021-05-04 17:34:25,wallstreetbets,is it really a yolo if you only buy shares?
2021-05-04 17:38:00,wallstreetbets,I think you are nutty.... What have you done!

2021-05-04 17:49:11,wallstreetbets,Twitter has historically never done anything with their stock this is the stupidest yolo I have ever seen congratulations
2021-05-04 17:52:43,wallstreetbets,Was thinking about this but never decided to pull the trigger. What made you so sure you yolo d them?

2021-05-04 18:07:37,wallstreetbets,"You don’t know how refinancing works...You get your house appraised, then a new lender transfers the loan to them for 15 or 30 years. You do this to get a better interest rate so your payment goes down. With record low interest rates that is serious payment drop for some people. Also, for those that don’t have 20% equity, they have to pay Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI) monthly. If Your appraisal shows your house went up 20% in value, then you can ditch the PMI. Also, by refinancing when the home is valued high it opens up the opportunity to get a cash out refi (or home equity loan) that allows many people to pay off high interest debt. This is literally the best time ever to refinance your house...."

2021-05-04 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"DD: $ASO - Lawyers, Guns, and Money If you have not heard the song *Lawyers, Guns, and Money* by Warren Zevon then you're not missing much, but it does loosely tie into my analysis of **Academy Sports + Outdoors**.

**Intro:** There's a chance you haven't heard of Academy Sports if you're not from the Southern United States- and that's ok. The business is simple, Academy Sports operates as a sporting goods and outdoor recreational products retailer, similarly to Dick's Sporting Goods, Bass Pro Shops, Cabela's, and Sportsman's Warehouse. In terms of business model, there's not much more to it than that, except for 1 key difference compared to Dick's and some other competitors; **Academy Sports sells guns and ammunition**. I'll be using some comparisons to these company's in the analysis below. 

**Notes:**

1. The reason I'm putting this write-up together today is because of recent action on behalf of the major shareholders. I will go more into detail on that below.
2. ASO was intially publicly offered at the beginning of October 2020. I typically stay away from IPOs in general, but took a look at the company and decided to do a deeper dive. 

**Metrics:** 

1. **ROIC**, as of today, is 12.48%. This has improved year over year since 2019(the company was private before this so financial statements only go back so far) and doubled from 2020 to 2021. While Sportsman's Warehouse has had double digit ROIC over the last few years as well, it's more sporadic and up or down with some negative returns mixed in quarterly as well. Dick's is the steadier of the 2 comparisons maintaining that ~10% ROIC over the last few years(GuruFocus).
2. **D/E ratio** is currently at about .71. The good news, however, is that because ASO exists largely in the Southern United States, they did not bleed as much during the Lockdown Era. Depending upon the state, stores were kept open and selling while competitors had to close their doors and take on more leverage to survive. This is reflected further in ASO's financial statements showing that virtually all of their existing debt is long term. Their current cash position outweighs their short term debt substantially. (Side note, their cash position has been *at least doubling* every year for the last 3 years.)
3. **P/E & PEG** ratios are 8.91 and .21, respectively. The PEG ratio is based on Finviz's EPS Next 5 years expectations, but since I'm a fan of extrapolating out a shorter amount of time from the most recent data as possible, a safer PEG ratio to assume is 8.91/11.05(Next year's EPS growth expectations), which would be .80 instead. Again, this is the *low end* EPS growth expectations for ASO. Admittedly, the previous year was a great boon for outdoor and sporting goods retailers, so instead, if you'd like to take a larger sample size of the last 5 years EPS growth it would be 8.91/32.7, or .27 PEG ratio. For a quick comparison, Dick's expected EPS for next year is an 8% growth and with a P/E of 15.77, that yields a PEG ratio of 1.9. But I didn't need to calculate that to tell you that Dick's is largely done expanding and growing. 
4. **Cash flow from Operations** has skyrocketed over the last few years, but it's important to note an anomaly. A large change in payables occurred from 2020 to 2021 which significantly impacted ASO's change in working capital. If removing it from the equation, to help get a better understanding of their cash flow operations, they still nearly *tripled* cash flow from continuing operations. Net income from continuing operations over the last few years has grown at an incredible rate too. (Yahoo Finance). Gross profit in general has followed a similar escalation path.
5. **The outside influence** of the guns & ammunition industry, while not a strict mathematical metric, should also be considered. Academy Sports, described by one of my Texas-born friends, is ""an institution."" Currently there is an on-going ammo shortage that's affecting the industry that is expected to grow at a rate of at least 6% a year through the next 5 years(Mordor Intelligence). The sports gun market is growing and many competitors simply do not offer to fill that market niche. 

**So what's the catch?**
Well, I talked about the Guns... I talked about the Money... What about the Lawyers? Academy Sports is largely owned by private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts or KKR & Co. Inc. for short. As of this morning, they own roughly 65% of Academy Sports, making them the majority decision makers for the company. I want to be clear, **this is both good and bad**. Such a large position of ownership controlling the decisions for ASO will almost always benefit KKR moreso than other shareholders. On the other hand, KKR invested in ASO in 2011 and have helped establish the company as a quickly growing and successful retailer. The two are intertwined in a way that is mutually beneficial to each other, but not as much for shareholders. **Fortunately, this will change over time**.

Academy Sports + Outdoors announced after market on May 3rd that KKR will be issuing an additional 14 million shares of stock. For context, that accounts for roughly 1/3 of the current share float so this will dilute the shares fairly significantly. The upside to this is two-fold: 

1.  Starting today, shares should start trading a discounted, enticing price.
2. ASO also agreed to buyback as much as $100 million shares worth of the offering, thus reducing the dilution and adding to shareholder wealth. 

**Subjective analysis:** I like ASO and I like its prospects. It has the growth potential that Dick's no longer has, their management team has helped been guided by KKR to profitability, and it fills a market niche that some other competitors do not fill. It's important to note that the unraveling of KKR's shares will continue to happen over time, which will simultaneously frustrate shareholders but also spread ownership to a more reasonable degree across the Institutional spectrum. Their new focus on ecommerce has helped strengthen their bottom line and it's already started to pay dividends *without* considerable store growth. In a recent report, management had stated that 2021 won't be a time of store openings due to the inability to properly scout locations(although it was stated that 2022 should see 8-10 new openings). This is the slow growth mentality that I'm all for. This will likely be a multi-year hold for me, but it could just be the next big thing in Outdoor Sports & Recreation."
2021-05-04 13:13:38,wallstreetbets,OP has had pretty much all good calls [https://www.markovchained.com/profiles/view/reddit:F1rstxLas7](https://www.markovchained.com/profiles/view/reddit:F1rstxLas7) 3/3 so far.
2021-05-04 09:51:39,wallstreetbets,Lol sell & wait for the dip is what I heard.
2021-05-04 11:45:53,wallstreetbets,"Are you 100% sure the offering is dilutive?  Looking at the SEC filing it appears KKR and a couple of other smaller institutional parties are selling 14M of existing shares, but I am new to these forms and may not be understanding it correctly."
2021-05-04 10:59:50,wallstreetbets,What did they do the offering to raise money for?
2021-05-04 11:07:37,wallstreetbets,I was hiding in Honduras
2021-05-04 09:51:52,wallstreetbets,I like the widespread cover best
2021-05-04 11:14:22,wallstreetbets,I already did the research on gun companies and retailers under these circumstances. Does not check out.
2021-05-04 17:34:37,wallstreetbets,"KKR is selling a block of shares it already owned, this is not dilutive, it will however increase the float.   This not unusual for private equity,  they typically IPO a decent chunk of the company, and then slowly whittle the size of their position down through block trades or secondary offerings so that they can focus on other opportunities.

Management has indicated a willingness to buy back up to $100m of stock.  Why, I'm not sure, I guess to reassure investors that they're bullish.  IMO, they should focus on paying down debt and getting their credit rating back to investment grade.

High margins on ammo right now is helping their profit margins.  Whomever said guns and ammo was only 10% of sales, can you point me towards what call that was on?  Didn't see it in the earnings transcript.  Maybe it was an analyst call, and was on a research piece?"
2021-05-04 09:56:58,wallstreetbets,"Diluting shares=puts will print. Sure I’ve been to academy. I believe they are having inventory issues like the rest of retail. While I don’t think they’ll go out of business or hurt too bad bc southern and sporting goods, I doubt they’ll see significant growth for quite a while."
2021-05-04 16:56:16,wallstreetbets,Great DD. Been ~100% in for a few weeks but will end up holding a nice chunk after selling the next rally. Great entry points this month for June!

2021-05-04 12:06:00,wallstreetbets,"A few weeks ago in a call ASO leadership said guns/ammo account for roughly 10% of their sales (pretty sure it was sales, may have been a different metric? Definitely 10% by some measure...).  It isn't strictly a guns/ammo play IMHO, but it is a factor."
2021-05-04 12:27:38,wallstreetbets,I never under estimate the ability of an anti-gun president to sell guns and ammo. Couple that with the current shortage and people are going to be stockpiling for some time.
2021-05-04 10:07:46,wallstreetbets,"They addressed inventory concerns in their last earnings calls. Better now than it was previously, and have more cash on hand than ever before to fuel growth. 

Also, don't look now, but there seems to be a chance ASO outperforms the rest of the NASDAQ today a day after this news of share dilution came out... wowza."

2021-05-04 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Time to buy the dip $AMD - short DD Hello fellow autists.

&#x200B;

Wanted to share some quick DD and some of my reasons why it's a good time to jump on the AMD train as a mid-long term investment. Full disclosure i have 100 shares and 2 short puts on AMD expiring 5/7 @$85. here we go.

&#x200B;

**Why buy?**

$AMD released their earnings last week with some pretty stellar results both on YoY and vs consensus estimate. They increased their full year guidance from a 37% YoY growth to 50%, and what does the market do? It dumps the crap out of the stock down almost $12 from earnings intraday high of $89. 

They say stonk prices are valued by future potential and not past performance, and it seems the market doesn't like good earnings or upgrades to forecasts. This I don't understand and this market movement downwards presents an opportunity to buy in when the stock is undervalued. 

As a gamer, i recognise how AMD has transformed over the years, and simply as a chip maker its clearly the market leader in CPU's now, and with an all encompassing monopoly over the current of consoles. There's simply no downside to their current trajectory.

&#x200B;

**Chip shortage.**

The elephant in the room is obviously the global chip shortage. I believe this is the core reason for all the FUD. If we dig a bit deeper the chip shortage is really because of Covid, more people at home to work, play and learn means more demand for tech, which is a great thing in the mid to long run. 

But I believe that the market is being short sighted at the moment, focussing in, and penalising AMD because of their percieved risk around being able to pump out enough stock to meet demand.

&#x200B;

**Final thought**

End of the day, i think if your investment horizon is more than 12months, there is a pretty strong bull case for AMD. Looking at the 1 year chart, there is a pretty strong support around $73-75.

As always do your own research , but hopefully you'll see what a massive potential AMD is.  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀

2021-05-04 09:23:15,wallstreetbets,One of the biggest reasons for the chip shortage besides covid is the drought in Taiwan. It takes a ton of water to make microchips and Taiwan just hasn't been getting the rain it usually gets. Some of the reservoirs are down below 10% capacity
2021-05-04 11:04:30,wallstreetbets,AMD and viac all in
2021-05-04 11:15:36,wallstreetbets,I’m still holding my 80 shares at 30 😀
2021-05-04 12:26:27,wallstreetbets,Sorry this goes against my buy high sell low mindset.
2021-05-04 15:56:30,wallstreetbets,But I already bought both dips back in March.  How many f\*\*king dips do I have to buy??
2021-05-04 16:40:24,wallstreetbets,unpopular opinion: amd is the next tesla
2021-05-04 13:21:49,wallstreetbets,AMD > NVIDIA >>>>>> INTEL
2021-05-04 11:21:28,wallstreetbets,Rsi is currently sitting at 17 and wayyyy below on the macd. Down $11 for the week. Such a perfect position to buy some nice 2 week out calls.
2021-05-04 09:19:00,wallstreetbets,Sitting on 42 AMD calls expiring across different dates until end of year. Will buy 2 more AMD calls today.
2021-05-04 12:47:37,wallstreetbets,"On the daily, AMD's chart kind of looks like a head and shoulders trying to break back down to the mid-50s level - so I decided to go all-in on shares today."
2021-05-04 12:49:40,wallstreetbets,Seven layer dip... let's gooo!
2021-05-04 13:42:40,wallstreetbets,Trippled down on leap calls. This is an easy bet.
2021-05-04 16:06:40,wallstreetbets,I hope we see GME like squeeze on this one. Go AMD 🚀🚀
2021-05-04 16:14:37,wallstreetbets,"I modeled AMD for a pitch competition, easily a $125 stock by EOY. Their numbers don’t justify such a low price."
2021-05-04 10:18:00,wallstreetbets,Was waiting on an AMD dip. I aped in.
2021-05-04 12:09:02,wallstreetbets,In since $16 and I'm never selling.
2021-05-04 11:02:25,wallstreetbets,"I agree, this stock should be $120 right now. what gives???"
2021-05-04 10:06:36,wallstreetbets,I'm in. 3 shares at $81 only but whatever
2021-05-04 10:18:24,wallstreetbets,AMD is in the process of buying XLNX. It is an arb play for hedge funds. Buying stock for the long term might be ok but be careful with short term options. It is getting enticing though I must admit I've played it mostly wrong  in the past including having sold covered called against my XLNX stock and having it called away right before expiry.
2021-05-04 12:54:53,wallstreetbets,"I fully agree with your analysis. Also, I fully trust Lisa Sue and the way she is evolving the company. In my opinion she just started.  It does not make sense to see AMD going under 80 bucks after such great earnings report. I am all in AMD."
2021-05-04 15:59:35,wallstreetbets,"Also mention the merger and arbitrage by hedge funds . It’s shorted so they can make buck on merger. It will normalize after merger to closer to 100$ . 

Essentially hedge funds short AMD and buy XLNX when merger happens they don’t have to re buy AMD because their XNLX shares will convert to AMD.

But if you apes just moon it they will be forced to cover.

Not financial advice I hold 500 shares at $83"
2021-05-04 16:05:05,wallstreetbets,Holding my 1592 shares @ $53 and $140c 01/22. 🚀🚀🚀💰
2021-05-04 16:44:54,wallstreetbets,Amd to fucking space
2021-05-04 16:57:09,wallstreetbets,Sitting on AMD Jan 21 2022 85 Call Options and will probably buy more tomorrow if it dips again.
2021-05-04 17:29:23,wallstreetbets,This dump after their amazing earnings makes no sense. I got leaps and I added some shares lately
2021-05-04 17:32:49,wallstreetbets,I’ll Nasdaq to bottom out before I buy another fucking dip
2021-05-04 19:27:59,wallstreetbets,210% agreed AMD(team red) is a great buy they already lead the industry in cpus and have matched or surpassed nvidia in gpus depending on the benchmark. They have three different gaming platforms PlayStation Xbox and Windows 4 if you include Linux. They have had these platforms for awhile but their gpus sucked so it wasn’t that beneficial now it’s a different story. As a gamer and a developer I can tell you amd is destroying the cpu market. For the first time ever I now have a choice of amd when buying a web server. Amd makes more powerful cpus that draw far less power it’s only a matter of time before companies like Amazon start switching over to save power for computing and cooling. With gaming supporting their gpu division we might even start to see amd take market share from nvidia when it comes to data center because even though nvidia has them beat in ai task team reds gpus again draw less power. On top of all of this the have opened some of their gpu tools to the public by making them open source which will see huge support from the developer community which could make them leaders of industry standards in gpus. However I am curious to see what happens with apple since apple has been using their gpus for their MacBook Pro. If don’t continue to use it with the M1 I wonder how that will affect amd. At the moment I feel like this would only free up space for them to produce other chipsets that are in extreme demand but I guess we will see.
2021-05-04 09:02:21,wallstreetbets,"I’ve got everything in AMD...bought earlier this year in the $90s, but I’m a big believer 🚀"
2021-05-04 11:52:39,wallstreetbets,Just bought 2 after doing research I think sombody is trying to short the stock
2021-05-04 08:42:14,wallstreetbets,The only thing I’m going to add is May -> Nov is traditionally a downturn for most of the market. You’d be doing yourself a favor to wait to find the floor before buying in hard.
2021-05-04 10:38:01,wallstreetbets,I'm in AMD at $87 for 300 shares. I'm down about 12% and it doesn't feel good. I'd get out of this stock in a second if it bounces back up to the mid 80s. Better places to have my $26k stored
2021-05-04 09:07:21,wallstreetbets,How about $ON? More room to grow ?
2021-05-04 10:26:23,wallstreetbets,Went all in today
2021-05-04 10:14:07,wallstreetbets,AMD has lost me $20 in the time I've been holding onto it.
2021-05-04 09:25:58,wallstreetbets,"you guys have no idea what youre talking about, have fun losing all your money"
2021-05-04 10:20:47,wallstreetbets,Bought some more at $83 last week. I believe in it
2021-05-04 12:44:13,wallstreetbets,"true, but tech is down in flames today, as sectors rotate. It'll likely dip further."
2021-05-04 11:07:48,wallstreetbets,"When does the squeeze happen? My wife’s boyfriends mom wants to know.

Edit: I saw AMC$.. I thought this was a thread about the important stonks. Sorry for the inconvenience."
2021-05-04 12:53:08,wallstreetbets,"I just bought 7 shares at 77, hope this goes well because I got a loan from a friend to afford this shit"
2021-05-04 11:33:47,wallstreetbets,dip will end inside 72-52 range
2021-05-04 11:19:05,wallstreetbets,"I worry that it might be overvalued. Take a look at $INTC on the 5 year chart you'll see that even during the height of its dominance run, it stayed below $70. While they were around $60, AMD was around $3. Now we have AMD far above Intel by a good amount, and we wonder if it has room to grow. My 2 pennies is that AMD should be more, like $100+, and Intel should be significantly more but not more than AMD. When we look at Nvidia, and see prices of $600+, it just doesn't make any sense why AMD and Intel are where they are comparatively."
2021-05-04 11:58:01,wallstreetbets,"Looks like really high volume, millions of shares, on a few thousand shares. If a couple hundred thousand shares sold, the price would be at $85 now. Can someone with technical analysis experience elaborate?"
2021-05-04 13:29:39,wallstreetbets,Please make this happen.  Everyone in.  It’s a good company.
2021-05-04 13:31:33,wallstreetbets,I was thinking this too. 👍
2021-05-04 16:36:46,wallstreetbets,Bought today and so tempted to buy again tomorrow. The buyout and overall mood for tech stocks has created an amazing opening for buying undervalued AMD stock.
2021-05-04 16:47:33,wallstreetbets,I bought at 14 and just never sold. Not sure if I will.
2021-05-04 17:38:27,wallstreetbets,Can y'all come back for us bagholders in the 90's please and thank you
2021-05-04 19:21:48,wallstreetbets,"Not to burst any bubbles, but look at the puts extending far out, its going to be down a long time. Board might have to step in"
2021-05-04 11:47:39,wallstreetbets,What would a successful share offering this year do to the short squeeze? Please explain as if I am profoundly retarded.
2021-05-04 09:24:25,wallstreetbets,Hopefully 🙏 y’all are still helping the og game 400 gang be like ....why yolo on possible squeeze when money printers are lined up at gme
2021-05-04 11:09:21,wallstreetbets,#AMC
2021-05-04 18:24:25,wallstreetbets,Farm those free drinks at the penny slots
2021-05-04 12:25:25,wallstreetbets,33 and 777 are both godly numbers
2021-05-04 09:32:57,wallstreetbets,Or maybe Nvidia is just overvalued.
2021-05-04 16:15:50,wallstreetbets,I dont really understand marked cap.
2021-05-04 18:04:57,wallstreetbets,"Funny you mention this - I was watching TheStockGuy's Twitch stream today and he was talking about how this market just straight up doesn't give a shit about fundamentals, more specifically PE ratio."
2021-05-04 09:38:50,wallstreetbets,Perfect for smooth brained apes
2021-05-04 10:52:01,wallstreetbets,It still boggles my mind how AMD is now only 77-ish after such a stellar financial report. Most analysts predicted a $100 price target
2021-05-04 12:25:30,wallstreetbets,This started with the merger news.  I wonder if they are trying to keep the prices of AMD low because of the 1.74x per XILINX merge.
2021-05-04 11:15:49,wallstreetbets,"This is the hard hitting analysis I’m looking for.

Will the stock go up?

Well is it raining in Taiwan?"
2021-05-04 15:05:24,wallstreetbets,"That's mostly FUD, TSMC is running at 100% capacity and you can bet your ass the taiwanese government won't let them run out."
2021-05-04 11:20:10,wallstreetbets,Is drought in Taiwan code for economic sanctions from china?
2021-05-04 13:29:25,wallstreetbets,This is interesting. Why does it take ton of water ?
2021-05-04 13:07:17,wallstreetbets,"It is more due to anticipation or a lack thereof for the demand for chips. Leading to a global shortage as the demand did not go down as expected. Due to manufacturing constraints, a surplus is not sufficient to ease the shortage for a while to come. AMD will be in a strong position due to the expected increase in prices and AMDs MSRP compared to other semiconductor manufacturers."
2021-05-04 12:56:19,wallstreetbets,Lmao this is me. I have $10k between the two of them in stocks ($3k or so in margin) and like another $2k in calls and $1k in leaps
2021-05-04 12:03:17,wallstreetbets,But 20 more and sell covered calls.
2021-05-04 17:01:33,wallstreetbets,Yes
2021-05-04 13:40:09,wallstreetbets,"Good Plan LMAO. If it sees the mid 50's I'm all in, kids, old lady, cat, and all."
2021-05-04 10:21:41,wallstreetbets,Expect to see $74. That's where long term support has been.
2021-05-04 13:20:53,wallstreetbets,Remember when Salesforce bought Slack?
2021-05-04 09:00:46,wallstreetbets,"The funny thing is, AMD has been down Jan to Apr more than 15% already. so only difference it would make is either dropping, or dropping faster 😂"
2021-05-04 16:03:38,wallstreetbets,AMD skyrocketed last summer though.
2021-05-04 10:46:32,wallstreetbets,Happy to take a couple shares mien freind!
2021-05-04 10:40:11,wallstreetbets,"Oh wise one, please tell me my errors"
2021-05-04 12:01:48,wallstreetbets,"The AMC squeeze is never happening, hth."
2021-05-04 13:43:41,wallstreetbets,"Maybe. Scale in with a small buy at 74, more at 72, more at 62, and full position if it goes under 58. I'm sidelined until 74."
2021-05-04 12:04:26,wallstreetbets,"Take a look at market cap, not per share price."
2021-05-04 12:42:55,wallstreetbets,"This is a cute comment, in like the cute noob type of way. Somebody get this guy a helmet and a mouth guard. We must preserve the remaining braincells!"
2021-05-04 12:01:49,wallstreetbets,"Cramer was pushing Nvidia first because he was holding it, they only recommend to buy AMD when they’re ready to short and bring the price down. It’s basically like they’re setting you up for a robbery."
2021-05-04 12:44:53,wallstreetbets,"1) You ARE profoundly retarded  
2) Not every price adjustment/retrace is a short squeeze...... go buy more GME"
2021-05-04 16:00:56,wallstreetbets,What the fuck is this nonsense?
2021-05-04 09:34:10,wallstreetbets,not rly they are shitting gold lmao
2021-05-04 19:47:00,wallstreetbets,"As someone invested in AMD and not NVIDIA, NVIDIA really dominates in machine learning, mostly thanks to CUDA. I'm probably a dumdum for not investing in NVIDIA but I think AMD is solid and undervalued, and I've always just liked them as a company. But NVIDIA is definitely the stronger of the two, possibly overvalued but anyhow I'd say not as much growth potential as AMD"
2021-05-04 17:16:31,wallstreetbets,"its when you have a cap with a mark on it, like mario has an M on his cap"
2021-05-04 19:51:08,wallstreetbets,"I altavista'd it for you my dude

>Market capitalization refers to the total dollar market value of a company's outstanding shares of stock. Commonly referred to as ""market cap,"" it is calculated by multiplying the total number of a company's outstanding shares by the current market price of one share."
2021-05-04 17:30:28,wallstreetbets,"Like you know, the youngins say cap is a lie, well when somebody lies they get a mark on their face kinda like a tear drop every time you kill somebody."
2021-05-04 15:42:18,wallstreetbets,Nice name
2021-05-04 11:02:56,wallstreetbets,"I agree, should be at $120 right now."
2021-05-04 11:41:20,wallstreetbets,They had amazing earnings.  Should be going way up not way down.  Lots of shorting going in ugh.  I predict over 100 within a month
2021-05-04 16:00:23,wallstreetbets,They’re in the same spot now that the were last July.  After multiple positive ERs...
2021-05-04 13:44:14,wallstreetbets,"Y’all clearly don’t understand the XLNX deal and it’s impact on shares.....

Ain’t no fucking way it’s going to $100 plus when only a degenerate moron would even bid on it at such a price. So how should be that high if there’s no one bidding higher and higher lol?

There’s a reason why most funds and big money players aren’t spamming the buy button on amd. Because of the xlnx deal."
2021-05-04 12:12:47,wallstreetbets,I live in Taiwan and it is currently raining...but I live in the one city that isn't experiencing a drought this year so...not helpful
2021-05-04 11:53:37,wallstreetbets,"No, it's a literal drought. The fabrication process used to create the chips is heavily dependent on water as cooling."
2021-05-04 15:06:18,wallstreetbets,Water is used to clean wafers and dissolve impurities. I'm not clear on the details but it takes a ton of purified water.
2021-05-04 13:00:11,wallstreetbets,Can’t wait to meet you in your castle u will be buying
2021-05-04 10:22:51,wallstreetbets,"What do you mean exactly, I'm retarded so"
2021-05-04 16:04:09,wallstreetbets,What happened?
2021-05-04 11:11:02,wallstreetbets,I bought the dip but it keeps dipping. Please advise Houston.
2021-05-04 12:55:10,wallstreetbets,Rofl
2021-05-04 10:42:08,wallstreetbets,Sold out shit the moment it drops
2021-05-04 19:49:26,wallstreetbets,Yeah that’s because it’s already seen it’s growth potential. It’s reached its floor or will see gradual increases or decreases over the years depending on their innovation.
2021-05-04 16:27:19,wallstreetbets,Nice name
2021-05-04 18:22:55,wallstreetbets,It's still going to take AMD a lot of work to change its image from budget chip vendor to market leader. Even if companies are buying AMD CPUs for their data centers how many executive assume it's all Intel? Despite zen architecture being a few generations old its still seen a somewhat of a fluke by old school IT shops. The companies running decade old accounting software don't care about HPC or high density workloads. For these boomers it will be tough to convince them that Intel is no longer the gold standard.
2021-05-04 13:12:12,wallstreetbets,I believe AMD is extremely undervalued but I do not think it’s going to break 90 by end of May. I would love to eat my words since I have shares. I bought calls back in February and watched them bleed for months even on good news.
2021-05-04 14:46:41,wallstreetbets,How is the XLNX deal so bad? I read it quickly but it seems like a big acquisition in a booming market.
2021-05-04 17:22:40,wallstreetbets,"I can't seem to find any clear detail on share impact in my 4.2 seconds of Googling - so is my math right here?

$35 billion all-stock deal 

245 million shares of XLNX outstanding (\~$143/sh)

1.7234 sh of AMD per sh of XLNX = 422 million shares of AMD

(Are we to assume these all net new shares?)

AMD is currently 1.22 billion shares outstanding, so adding 422 mil represents \~35% share dilution?

If so, then a $100 price target based on AMD's current fundamentals would be worth \~$65/share (for AMD alone, exclusive of XLNX's worth).  Am I mathing that right?"
2021-05-04 12:21:04,wallstreetbets,Why is TSMC building foundries in Arizona?  Not trolling - sounds like you understand the industry and I’m curious why if its water dependent they are building in the US in an area that is short water with chronic shortages possible as the Colorado is already overdrawn and reservoirs there are low.
2021-05-04 16:25:45,wallstreetbets,"This is correct.  

Basically in between steps they have to wash the wafer down with pure water before starting the next step."
2021-05-04 10:30:54,wallstreetbets,"AMD has come down and bounced off $74 area last Aug 11, Sept 3rd week, beginning of Nov, March 7-8, and March 25-30. It could be the completion of a complex head and shoulders and prone to a massive drop if support doesn't hold and the gap at $72 doesn't cause a reversal. Another gap in the mid 60's. Role reversal support at $58. If we see $58 I'm mortgaging the house and going all in."
2021-05-04 10:38:01,wallstreetbets,means buy puts!!
2021-05-04 16:43:59,wallstreetbets,Tanked and never recovered. look at the chart
2021-05-04 11:33:41,wallstreetbets,The same could be said for AMD though.
2021-05-04 13:39:46,wallstreetbets,Nvidia isn't worth a ton of money because of their consumer desktop graphics cards dude.
2021-05-04 13:03:54,wallstreetbets,That means they're not producing the optimal amount of product and their prices are too low
2021-05-04 19:54:00,wallstreetbets,"A lot of young people have been getting into machine learning, but AMD doesn't have something like CUDA"
2021-05-04 15:05:15,wallstreetbets,"Unfortunately the tech market is on a downward correction- so all tech stocks will likely see bigger dips. I certainly wouldn’t want to be a short term trading with AMD. Wait for a little more of a dip, then buy shares or leaps.

I think it’ll be $100+ but not til EOY or well in 2022 due to overall market correction."
2021-05-04 14:58:34,wallstreetbets,"It’s not bad. It’s about the costs of the acquisition and dilution of amd stock. 

This isn’t some cheap little deal. It’s got big ramification on the current share float. That’s why the price action is the way it is. It has nothing to do with amd fundamentals, it has to do with the math of the aquisition costs."
2021-05-04 18:43:39,wallstreetbets,"No, you're mathing badly.

Imagine you have 7 red apples and 3 green apples. What percentage of red apples do you have? 70%, just like your losses to AMD call options this year. According to your math, you'd have 1-(3/7) = 57% red apples.

To calculate the actual dilution, you need to divide the AMD shareholders' amount with the total amount after the new shares are added, i.e. 1220/(1220+422) = 74%.

This means the dilution decreases the stock value by 26% for the AMD shareholders and the share price should be $74 if we assume with a 100% certainty that Lisa Su squanders the whole Xilinx corporation immediately after its acquisition and its value becomes 0.

AMD is still vastly undervalued.

Disclaimer: I eat crayons."
2021-05-04 18:13:49,wallstreetbets,"you are right in general thinking of the deal. Obviously, a lot more is factored in like how much is should XLNX be factored into the stock price etc. But overall, the dilution is why people are shorting AMD to drive to their fair value price. I believe once we get the XLNX earnings, it will be more clear where AMD is headed."
2021-05-04 13:02:24,wallstreetbets,"We get water from CO.. Water is cheap here surprisingly.  Also there are no tornados, earthquakes, hurricanes, etc so all the companies have to worry about is A/C."
2021-05-04 13:14:14,wallstreetbets,because labor is much cheaper.
2021-05-04 18:59:48,wallstreetbets,"Hmm, yes, why are they building their factories in a place with water shortages? Well, where are their factories now? In a place with water shortages, of course! It would be a huge risk to build a factory in a place without water shortages. Do factories even work without water shortages?

2021-05-04 10:38:24,wallstreetbets,But I have shares don't tell me this. This doesn't confirm my biases
2021-05-04 19:59:32,wallstreetbets,"Same could be said for AMD, they are starting to rip Intel a new one in the HPDC and Server segments."

2021-05-04 18:19:22,wallstreetbets,"I agree. Although I bought some, still waiting for even lower dip to go all in.

PS: I am a dumb ape."
2021-05-04 17:09:37,wallstreetbets,"Stop breathing through your mouth for a sec and think about it. The deal is almost certainly not dilutive.

XLNX shareholders are getting 1.7234 shares of AMD in exchange for their XLNX shares. XLNX has 245.77m shares outstanding. This means 423.56m shares of AMD will be issued to XLNX shareholders. This equals an increase of $33b in market cap in regard to AMDs current price. 

BUT here’s the kicker. AMD gets about $31b worth of stuff (namely all of XLNX’s assets/their market cap). AMD probably reaps some benefits in the form of synergies as well. 

How much? Who knows. Maybe AMD is overpaying a tad maybe they are getting a good deal in terms of the savings they reap with consolidation. But any move upward in XLNX should at least allow AMD to follow. 

Disclaimer: I eat crayons."
2021-05-04 15:21:44,wallstreetbets,"So you're saying exit once you're in the green?...

Is the acquisition not already priced in?.."

2021-05-04 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"SNDL Stock Price Drop. Holding! I am holding based off analyst Pabio Zuanic of Cantor Fitzgerald's rating of HOLD. He is almost a 5 star analyst, ranked #618 out of 7,491 analyst. 

He recommended a HOLD, based off, ""Most importantly, the company now sits on C$700Mn of cash and will look to M/A both domestic and elsewhere. Price Target $1.40. 

Tamy Chen, ranked #6,461 out of 7,491 as a analyst. She is not even a 1 star rated analyst. She recommended sell.  I remember the last webcast and she seemed negative about M/A and the joint venture.  

So, I am going to stay with Pabio's expert opinion of HOLDING. This rating was posted almost two months ago. I am looking forward to E/R on May 11th and will be attending the live WEBCAST on May 12th.

Personally, I think a lot people who are short selling this stock are going to get burned 🔥. 

I personally see a lot of potential and an upside.

While, the price is down, I am not going to let fear deter me from my position.

2021-05-04 11:29:14,wallstreetbets,This aged well. How do you kids not know that crushing earnings = fall off a cliff on open.
2021-05-04 11:31:46,wallstreetbets,Need this thing to drop into the 20s so I can load up
2021-05-04 11:42:15,wallstreetbets,Well everybody else had good earning and they dropped so.....
2021-05-04 11:42:29,wallstreetbets,"Dunno bout all that, but it’s down like all the rest"
2021-05-04 12:14:42,wallstreetbets,Earnings are alright but definitely not amazing..
2021-05-04 12:31:28,wallstreetbets,Ah the ol earning beat expectations and thinking price will go up....
2021-05-04 12:54:24,wallstreetbets,I feel it will bounce back this week. You convinced me
2021-05-04 13:31:30,wallstreetbets,"Saw someone mention this is another thread which I think is true: the price is stuck at this level because EagleTree is reducing their holdings significantly, they can sell on open market, so every time the price goes up a bit it just comes right back down. Need to wait for next SEC filing see what their latest ownership is. I'm long and holding."
2021-05-04 15:04:48,wallstreetbets,lol
2021-05-04 15:09:18,wallstreetbets,"Jesus fuck. And to me it would make sense to pick up even more when eventually the GPU and Cpu supply catches up with demand... I would imagine people haven't just been building PCs as a case and fans only, many probably waiting to build a PC right now"
2021-05-04 15:54:11,wallstreetbets,Gme + crsr = the perfect union
2021-05-04 15:58:16,wallstreetbets,"Earning haven’t mean anything in for a while now.  See AMZN, AMD, NVDA"
2021-05-04 16:48:09,wallstreetbets,"oof, this aged well"
2021-05-04 17:25:45,wallstreetbets,"Maybe you don’t understand how earnings work fella. 

I expect this to drill to the center of the earth tomorrow since they did so well and it was good news."
2021-05-04 17:27:58,wallstreetbets,This stock incorrectly dipped in sentiment with the rest of the of the tech selloff. Fundamentals are solid - I would definitely hold this stock long term. Market can be so irrational in the day to day craziness of things.
2021-05-04 17:50:03,wallstreetbets,"i dumped this stock after it crushed earnings in Q1 and it did the same thing, tech stocks are so fucked right now earnings don't mean shit, you just pick the hot item at the moment ride it for a week and jump ship."
2021-05-04 18:01:57,wallstreetbets,Lets do it. Great beat
2021-05-04 18:05:45,wallstreetbets,CRSR  to the moon🚀
2021-05-04 18:06:47,wallstreetbets,Is anyone talking about the short interest on CRSR ?
2021-05-04 18:11:51,wallstreetbets,Anyone paying attention to LOGI would know CRSR was gonna be red no matter how well they did. For the last 2 earnings each company has absolutely beaten all estimates and each time their stock drops.
2021-05-04 18:25:25,wallstreetbets,"Sold at 35.01 cost average 31ish 2000

&#x200B;

bought again at 31.56 2000"
2021-05-04 19:33:05,wallstreetbets,"Shorts are unloading positions and generally the market has sucked for a few months new, especially if you are in tech / speculative tech"
2021-05-04 19:42:28,wallstreetbets,This stock needs to be 69.420 min
2021-05-04 09:47:43,wallstreetbets,"lol if anyone has been paying any attention at all, tech earnings are totally priced in already. ""Blowout earnings?"" Big fucking deal, share price is gonna drop 3-4%. If you're playing tech earnings right now you're gonna have a bad time."
2021-05-04 11:20:13,wallstreetbets,"LOL, good day for CRSR. The pandemic is ending, CRSR is going to continue to sink just like it has for the last 3 months."
2021-05-04 10:44:07,wallstreetbets,"Lol ..... how dumb

PFE > CRSR - I like a green P&L"
2021-05-04 09:50:23,wallstreetbets,Oof
2021-05-04 09:58:03,wallstreetbets,Distraction
2021-05-04 10:13:12,wallstreetbets,"Well, I was going to buy but now that it's here I will not"
2021-05-04 10:40:58,wallstreetbets,Lol
2021-05-04 10:46:26,wallstreetbets,Waiting for its partnership with gamestop
2021-05-04 12:41:12,wallstreetbets,Rip
2021-05-04 15:43:36,wallstreetbets,Doubled my position; CRSR is now my biggest position at 450 shares. Amazing earnings. Trading at fwd p/e of 20 and growing at more than twice that rate. With a 20% short interest this baby is primed to blow: GME style!!!  HOLD AND BUY YOU APES
2021-05-04 10:41:21,wallstreetbets,"Wasn’t good enough I guess hahahaha

Don’t know what more they want"
2021-05-04 12:05:38,wallstreetbets,"This is the Wall Street way, remember  more or less everything is a gamble including the live!!

![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|trollface)"
2021-05-04 10:22:21,wallstreetbets,Just doesn't make sense
2021-05-04 12:44:50,wallstreetbets,Got crushed lol
2021-05-04 11:08:35,wallstreetbets,market is down in general plus CRSR is being shorted masssively
2021-05-04 09:52:03,wallstreetbets,Exactly this... can’t wrap my head around it 😓
2021-05-04 13:46:49,wallstreetbets,"Look at it this way... if they didn't crush earnings it would be down a looooot more. Tech as a whole is bleeding and outlook on chips is real shitty. Bundle that with corsair making a lot of normal consumer products during a time people are having trouble getting parts to build a computer.


Sure they raised their forecast but their P/E is also already at around 29.5. It's already assumed they'll be doing pretty good all things considered."
2021-05-04 09:41:10,wallstreetbets,They crushed earnings. I think it’s more due to short sellers than an actual sell off we’ll see in due time
2021-05-04 08:24:19,wallstreetbets,Hell yeah. The reason it goes up and down randomly is because it just shorts shorting and buying back. It really has no volume. Hopefully this is the match that lights the fuse and we take off 🚀
2021-05-04 11:12:48,wallstreetbets,"We got the volume, but for selling lol"
2021-05-04 10:45:01,wallstreetbets,I'm a double tard
2021-05-04 08:39:40,wallstreetbets,That is a lot of $$$ in CRSR shares...
2021-05-04 12:23:11,wallstreetbets,I have some December 40$ calls and they are RED right now
2021-05-04 12:41:33,wallstreetbets,are you still in?
2021-05-04 09:20:14,wallstreetbets,may i ask what % of your net worth you have in this one company? curious on your risk managment
2021-05-04 13:07:04,wallstreetbets,"buy in june, noted."
2021-05-04 12:36:44,wallstreetbets,How do you feel about losing so badly right now.
2021-05-04 17:14:51,wallstreetbets,"Haha, I had this same play when they destroyed their last earnings and guess what…this stock does not move up…ever. Good luck!"
2021-05-04 18:18:22,wallstreetbets,Shares what a letdown
2021-05-04 10:02:16,wallstreetbets,Take off failed. we were launching into space and then the rocket blew up
2021-05-04 11:41:51,wallstreetbets,"avg down mate. If you bought it for a reason nothings changed right? other than the price. Them calls with 80ish DTE are looking juicy right now, if you believe in them and the space."
2021-05-04 09:34:07,wallstreetbets,I think short seller trying to kill the great earnings. We won’t know till a few weeks from now
2021-05-04 13:37:42,wallstreetbets,Looks like we both read the same CRSR post with calls dated for 5/21 smh
2021-05-04 13:37:49,wallstreetbets,Looks like we both read the same CRSR post with calls dated for 5/21 smh
2021-05-04 08:53:46,wallstreetbets,We’ll crush through $35 too trust. It’ll get on funds radar then we go 🚀➡️🌕
2021-05-04 11:02:37,wallstreetbets,"Bought in at $46 the last time I heard this ""crsr going to crush earnings"" story. And now they actually crush earnings and it's down, makes sense"
2021-05-04 08:30:13,wallstreetbets,Yes and no. As someone who believes in this stock so much you could make a case it was overvalued. It was sold off and was shorted but sell off was the main reason. Short interest went from 30ish% to as low as 18% during that time. It decreased which points to what I just said. I think they also didn’t think they could sustain the level of business and operation because things were opening up. But this quarter just contradicted that. Definitely see us going back into the 40’s
2021-05-04 19:39:06,wallstreetbets,"Started the day with 700 shares but bought another 75 around $31.50 today. My 5 calls are still down about 90%, and that makes me sad ( 🤡)."
2021-05-04 10:05:53,wallstreetbets,Lol big facts. I’d be willing to bet it’s heavy short selling to kill momentum. It’s undervalued tech stock doubt it’s just sell off on good news. Could be trading in relation to SOX.X
2021-05-04 15:19:14,wallstreetbets,My brotha!!!!  Or sista!!!! Or Themmmaaa!!!!
2021-05-04 13:40:23,wallstreetbets,Company also announced on 8-K they are moving HQ next year and adding 30K sq. Feet.
2021-05-04 17:54:48,wallstreetbets,"He mistook the reflection of the moon for the moon itself.

Easy mistake, of course"
2021-05-04 09:01:21,wallstreetbets,It’s not unusual to still have winners on a down day.
2021-05-04 09:22:22,wallstreetbets,"Sure hope to see some red, I'll be buying heavy I think you are right we sell off quickly and the close will be very interesting"
2021-05-04 09:26:10,wallstreetbets,CRSR usually has a mind of its own
2021-05-04 08:50:05,wallstreetbets,RemindMe! 7 hours “reply @ $34.9”
2021-05-04 16:36:15,wallstreetbets,You’s was right
2021-05-04 10:33:04,wallstreetbets,"You never heard the saying “sell in may and go away”

1) sell off because of good new “cashing in”

2) it’s a low volume stock short seller trying to crush momentum 

3) trading in relation to SOX.X

Could be any of those major reasons"

2021-05-04 18:04:46,wallstreetbets,I trippled down at the bottom today
2021-05-04 19:18:34,wallstreetbets,It’s a good stock so you’re not that retarded. Obviously can’t say when but long term it will go up
2021-05-04 09:29:40,wallstreetbets,"1) either people taking it as a opportunity to cash in on good news. I doubt that

2) it’s premarket stock still has little volume short seller trying to kill momentum before market so they don’t get crushed"
2021-05-04 09:25:06,wallstreetbets,"Bad guidance, beating doesn’t mean too much"
2021-05-04 10:00:51,wallstreetbets,Annnd it’s down 5%…
2021-05-04 09:17:02,wallstreetbets,They’ll begin to cover within time. They’ll probably hold on but the way With the small improvements to balance sheet and the efficiency corsair is operating at the moment. They still have room to improve their margins compared to what competitors are at. If they do become more efficient I’d be scared if I was them
2021-05-04 10:30:38,wallstreetbets,I’m not learning anything I been trading for years not like 99% of the people here. If you last longer than a year congrats cause over 90% don’t make it past the first year let a lone last 7 years like me
2021-05-04 10:17:43,wallstreetbets,Multiple strong earnings. Q3 2020 “cause of covid”. People didn’t think they would have strong Q4 “they couldn’t momentum cause shortages”. “Q1 because shortages and thing opening up”. They’re expecting eps of around $2.66 which would put it at around 12p/e for a tech stock. Insanely undervalued
2021-05-04 10:27:45,wallstreetbets,We crashed. we hit a satellite and are headed down to earth

2021-05-04 10:34:31,wallstreetbets,Continue to sell those covered call. Been doing that since February. We’ll go to $40+ soon trust
2021-05-04 10:09:01,wallstreetbets,"It's down 25% from the Q4 earnings, so blowout Q1 was definitely not priced in. The whole market has been waiting to drop for a while and now it's happening.

Edit: word market"
2021-05-04 12:43:34,wallstreetbets,If you like green you're in the wrong place
2021-05-04 12:39:05,wallstreetbets,"The people causing movement in this stock don't care about fundamentals. They care about the low float and how easy it is to swing. 

It has been a day traders wet dream. We need volume to break out of the sideways cycle. 

I actually wish they had sold those additional shares onto the market during the lockup period. The stock could definitely benefit from higher float."
2021-05-04 19:35:48,wallstreetbets,Have you looked at the S&P 500 today

2021-05-04 13:13:56,wallstreetbets,"The markets has always had stocks that are shorted. Gme is a once in a blue moon thing, stop saying any stock that is shorted is being manipulated."
2021-05-04 11:42:01,wallstreetbets,CRSR is one of the most manipulated stocks in the market
2021-05-04 10:02:21,wallstreetbets,"20% SI is by any othen than GME metrics a huge number and if you look at the CRSR numbers, the 3B$ market cap is super low. That being said, the market situation is the most likely reason for the drop. Everything is red, the money is being taken away from the stocks right now and we might see a heavy drop in the coming weeks."
2021-05-04 09:48:56,wallstreetbets,"lol ""short sellers are always the reason I'm a fucking retard!!!""

No, friend, it's due to tech valuations being absolutely insane and ""blowout earnings"" already being priced in for everything."
2021-05-04 09:46:16,wallstreetbets,That's not how things work. Get GME out of your ass.
2021-05-04 19:38:18,wallstreetbets,"If short sellers are buying back, wouldn't that drive the price up, not down?"
2021-05-04 08:47:38,wallstreetbets,"Yessir ski got my money where my mouth is

If they continue to perform like this. I can see it being $50+ stock"

2021-05-04 16:43:12,wallstreetbets,Of course

2021-05-04 10:07:20,wallstreetbets,How can these short sellers make the entire market red?
2021-05-04 09:58:10,wallstreetbets,"So you're saying you haven't noticed every tech earnings beat has led to a share drop over the past two weeks? It's called ""fully priced into the valuation"""
2021-05-04 10:37:16,wallstreetbets,"Short sellers aren't the reason for every selloff...

Plus CRSR doesn't even have that high short interest all things considered"

Apple didn’t give me a charger on my 12 pro how am I supposed to charge my phone?"

2021-05-04 09:52:29,wallstreetbets,This is why they’ve been at $120-$130 a share for like 6 months now that explains a lot.
2021-05-04 13:20:45,wallstreetbets,Yeah sucks buying a new phone every time the old one runs out of battery

2021-05-04 10:38:03,wallstreetbets,"No you can definitely do on a red day and when the market is selling off is actually one of the best time as it’s added pressure. Plenty on margin and can cause them to get margin called. 
On Green Day’s is actually worse as it’s easier for something to stay overvalued than it is to go down"
2021-05-04 09:32:58,wallstreetbets,"Well the market disagrees with you so I’m pretty sure you’re clueless, keep bagholding tho 🤡 lemme know how that works out for ya"

2021-05-04 09:57:07,wallstreetbets,Not true. They were above 140 in January. I have the average cost to prove it.
2021-05-04 09:35:01,wallstreetbets,It’s a stock with almost no volume anything can make it move. You don’t know about stocks just stop
2021-05-04 13:01:19,wallstreetbets,It’s also literally about politics 😂
2021-05-04 11:20:12,wallstreetbets,"Well done.  The best way to find a stock's peak, is to see when someone here invests in it."

2021-05-04 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$BP - Major Play for May 2021 If any of you followed my previous posts/comments (e.g. $GME, $T, and several smaller companies I talked about in other threads) you would have done very well for yourself.

**My pick for May 2021 is $BP (formerly The British Petroleum Company).**

There are dozens of catalysts, for example:

* Rising oil prices ([https://www.caixabankresearch.com/en/economics-markets/commodities/what-behind-rise-oil-prices](https://www.caixabankresearch.com/en/economics-markets/commodities/what-behind-rise-oil-prices))
* $BP absolutely crushed the latest earnings released on 04/27/2021 ($2.6B quarter net profit, instead of expected $1.4B, earnings per share of $0.78 instead of expected $0.43 [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/27/bp-earnings-q1-2021.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/27/bp-earnings-q1-2021.html), [https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/BP/earnings](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/BP/earnings/))
* $BP announced $500MM stock buybacks for the second quarter ([https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/27/bp-earnings-q1-2021.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/27/bp-earnings-q1-2021.html))
* Europe/UK is completely re-opening ([https://www.npr.org/2021/04/06/984656647/after-months-of-lockdown-the-u-k-is-slowly-reopening](https://www.npr.org/2021/04/06/984656647/after-months-of-lockdown-the-u-k-is-slowly-reopening), [https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20210412-united-kingdom-eases-covid-19-lockdown-reopening-some-non-essential-businesses](https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20210412-united-kingdom-eases-covid-19-lockdown-reopening-some-non-essential-businesses))
* Travel Reopening Plans ([https://newsfilter.io/a/b317aa440b60517e32b3eff7a0cd7f65](https://newsfilter.io/a/b317aa440b60517e32b3eff7a0cd7f65))
* BP is constantly expanding into renewable energy to diversify ([https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/06/bp-aims-to-invest-more-in-renewables-and-clean-energy](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/feb/06/bp-aims-to-invest-more-in-renewables-and-clean-energy), [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211467X19300574](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211467X19300574), [https://www.marketwatch.com/story/this-technology-could-transform-renewable-energy-bp-and-chevron-just-invested-11613458808](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/this-technology-could-transform-renewable-energy-bp-and-chevron-just-invested-11613458808))

**TLDR: I am accumulating $BP May 21 $27 calls & stock (shares). Looking for $BP to hit $30/share by the end of May.**

Do your own due diligence, but I have about 88% of my portfolio in $BP right now."
2021-05-04 08:26:35,wallstreetbets,"My friends works for them - they are restructuring too which means getting rid of middle management to make them a leaner organisation. Covid is being used as an excuse to get rid of a lot of dead wood. 

Long term this is a strong play."
2021-05-04 08:36:47,wallstreetbets,BP is a solid solid play
2021-05-04 09:16:11,wallstreetbets,"the oil rebound since corona starts is awesome. BP is is solid pick. 

Hint: tomorow is dividend ex day :)"
2021-05-04 09:06:06,wallstreetbets,"I like the pick, I got in on xom at 40 @ 250shrs.  Inflation, oil goes up, stop the pipeline, oil goes up, green new deal chatter, oil goes up, increasing demand with reopening, oil goes up, iran shoots at Israel, oil goes up, china threatening Taiwan, oil goes up, create a pay to play carbon capture scheme,  oil goes up..Oil goes up = Stock goes up"
2021-05-04 09:57:05,wallstreetbets,"$BP is a solid strong buy for me right now. They seem to be on a good run right now and with them surpassing their expected earnings for this quarter, I can only see them moving upwards from here."
2021-05-04 11:06:31,wallstreetbets,"I agree, that's why I'm long $FENY, $BP, and $ENB"
2021-05-04 15:34:43,wallstreetbets,I have Oct $30 calls currently down about 3% so not really worried about them. $30 by end this month would help them out quite a bit.
2021-05-04 08:48:45,wallstreetbets,It’s on a good run right now but after following it for months I’m waiting for the dip back below $25 to strap in. When oil prices move down BP stock has been getting excessively slammed so I’m waiting for 1 more good news story about COVID cases on the rise.  Only have another couple weeks before that window closes though.
2021-05-04 18:17:00,wallstreetbets,This will fit right in with my shares in Trans Ocean (Rig)![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|give_upvote)

Hydrocarbons arent going anywhere regardless of how bad SJW's want it to go away and BP is at the forefront of transitioning to renewables(Biden Bucks).

For this reason im long and slowly increasing my position."

2021-05-04 10:23:27,wallstreetbets,"So sorry to hear that, may I ask what position you held at bp? :("
2021-05-04 10:37:08,wallstreetbets,Operations. I left as part of the Prudhoe Bay sale. I guess I shouldn’t say I lost my job; I got picked up by the new company in my same position. But boy it was sweet working for BP.
2021-05-04 10:45:14,wallstreetbets,"Haha I've been with bp for over 1 year now, joined when I turned 19 and I'm still enjoying it lol...what was so sweet about bp as someone who's still fairly new?"
2021-05-04 11:14:33,wallstreetbets,"They had a pension, and the best 401k plan possible. I found out that it’s not the norm for companies to let you contribute after tax money up to the full $58k IRS limit; most people believe the 401k limit is $19.5k. Plus they have something called an excess benefits plan where they keep matching even once you hit that limit. Health insurance was much better than the company I work for now. Their sick leave was basically unlimited; which I never took advantage of but others abused the shit out of. And they would just throw money at you in the form of gifts; like iPads, expensive jackets, gift cards, etc. It was also impossible to get fired. They were so afraid to get sued for wrongful termination that they would just keep bad employees around. You could egregiously fuck up, like cause millions of dollars with of equipment damage or production loss and their would be zero remedial action."
2021-05-04 12:59:34,wallstreetbets,This does not give me confidence
2021-05-04 11:31:23,wallstreetbets,"This is the realist shit someone has said LOL, was too afraid to say it myself but you make some great points, thanks buddy 🤣"
2021-05-04 13:14:10,wallstreetbets,"Right?! That’s why I personally would never invest in BP; I’ve seen how the company is run. Maybe they’re finally figuring out how to turn it around now, who knows? Oh and zero over site on corporate credit card use either. Office folks would go out for lunch every day and expense the whole thing as a team building activity. Per policy, they were allowed to have two alcoholic beverages on the company dime and then return to work. And they were allowed to fuel up their personal vehicles on the corporate card because they were attending a team building activity."
2021-05-04 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Nokia is extremely undervalued at current prices On April 29, Nokia reported stellar first quarter earnings for 2021: 

Revenue totaled €5.1 billion, 7% above the consensus estimates.

Gross margin was 38.2%, improving from 36.4% in this quarter last year.

EBITDA was €702 million, crushing the estimates of €150 million by over 367%.

It generated €1.2 billion in free cash flow during the quarter, turning positive from the negative €6 million during Q1 2020.

Nokia’s focus on 5G is already paying off. Management is seeing “continued momentum in 5G rollouts across all geographies, especially North America.” And from the favorable margins in Nokia’s 5G products, gross margin in mobile networks improved 2.1% from last year, reaching 33.2% during the quarter.

And Nokia’s AI-enabled chip ReefShark – which is used to power Nokia’s 5G base stations – made up 44% of 5G sales. ReefShark is on track to reach 70% of 5G sales by year’s end. ReefShark is Nokia’s most recent semiconductor that powers its 5G base stations.

The ReefShark chipset is smaller, decreasing the antenna size by half, which makes these base stations less bulky and obtrusive. It helps enable a 50 – 60% reduction in energy use compared to previous chips. This lowers the total cost of ownership for wireless providers – a great selling point.

Nokia now has 160 5G deals, of which 63 are in active deployment. And Nokia is currently engaged in 60 trial periods where it’s competing to win the contract. Nokia will have a favorable win rate as others try to compete with ReefShark.

And this month technology consulting firm PA Consulting named Nokia “the industry leader in 5G standard essential patents.” Nokia has a leading patent portfolio with over 3,500 patents that are declared as essential to 5G. Nokia’s patent portfolio will help it maintain a technological advantage compared to its competitors.

Nokia remains extremely undervalued at current prices and it remains a strong buy. It was the first breakthrough quarter for Nokia and it is going to be a big winner for us."
2021-05-04 10:09:34,wallstreetbets,Im gonna do you all a favour and not buy NOK so that it can keep growing
2021-05-04 11:03:22,wallstreetbets,"Good luck playing Theta Gang's favourite stock. I agree, Noki's undervalued as fuck, but there's no getting 'round the fact that stock's chart could be used as a fucking set square."

2021-05-04 08:01:21,wallstreetbets,"Only problem I have with Nokia is their isn’t much room for growth for my investment. Maybe 10-25% growth. And that’s a big maybe. Unless they buyback a huge portion of their o/s. But until then, I’m gonna buy 500 Jan 2022 calls 😂."

2021-05-04 12:47:55,wallstreetbets,"Extremely undervalued based on what? Sure they’ve created a substantial amount of FCFF but what they’re doing with that money is more important. 
What’s their WACC, what terminal growth rate are you using to come to the conclusion that their pps is low? How’s their credit rating? Were they able to refinance their debt for a lower rating or did they just issue more debt? 

A 1.8% increase in margins for a quarter isn’t a big deal unless their guidance tells us they should except 45% by EOY. 

All in all, I think your opinion on it being undervalued is just that, an opinion. You appear to have only selectively picked the most compelling (in your opinion) information from their balance sheet and haven’t don’t any true analysis via FCFF/E or DCF models. A+ for effort though"
2021-05-04 10:00:46,wallstreetbets,"If by undervalued, you mean run shorts against it. I like the stock."

2021-05-04 14:47:09,wallstreetbets,Doesn’t matter. The entire market is on a downswing correction. It’ll probably continue to dip a bit more since stocks are so high right now. There needs to be a correction before it’ll fly.

2021-05-04 11:41:30,wallstreetbets,"Me no brain. Me buy stonk, me buy calls 3 months back. Stonk go gronk. Cave money go gronk. Me go ook at post.

2021-05-04 10:49:03,wallstreetbets,When gme moons and we eat all the green crayons we buy nok. Got it 💦
2021-05-04 14:26:06,wallstreetbets,Speaking of undervalued - peep WINT. It’s ready to takeoff- releasing a new treatment later this year and huge insider trading activity over the past month with execs buying shares for well over 3$/share so anything less than that is free money (currently around 2.15/share)
2021-05-04 12:42:46,wallstreetbets,Thank you for your service.
2021-05-04 17:13:45,wallstreetbets,"That's not good enough, we need you to short NOK"
2021-05-04 17:58:02,wallstreetbets,I thought I was the only one who could sink a stock by simply purchasing it. Nice to know there are others out there with that talent. Cheers.
2021-05-04 10:37:10,wallstreetbets,This is the way?
2021-05-04 19:18:31,wallstreetbets,I will do the same. Everything I have been touching lately turns to poop. Lol

2021-05-04 10:47:07,wallstreetbets,"If I could trade my holdings in $NOK for drugs I would. There's a chance the value would go up; but,  if not, at least I could get high."
2021-05-04 08:46:59,wallstreetbets,"Yep, this is the issue with NOK. It needs a 1-10 reverse split or a *massive* stock buyback. There is just way too much stock out there for this thing to move significantly without Tesla-like momentum behind it. Which then just becomes a cyclical problem, because fewer people will invest in a stock that doesn't move, which causes it to move even less."
2021-05-04 19:43:35,wallstreetbets,"0.01% held by insiders, 4.8% held by institutions. jesus i've never seen anything this low. you're right. i guess whales don't like the stock."
2021-05-04 08:01:55,wallstreetbets,What's the target strike prices you goin for?
2021-05-04 10:05:19,wallstreetbets,"had more then 20% return on nokia in the past 6 months, sorry to break it to you :)"
2021-05-04 16:40:55,wallstreetbets,I was buying and selling it in this same price range in 2011-2012...
2021-05-04 12:02:17,wallstreetbets,"clearly you didn't check the stock, seeing as it only went down from premarket"
2021-05-04 08:16:15,wallstreetbets,Meow. Fuck you.

2021-05-04 10:15:20,wallstreetbets,Everything is always already factored into the price. It’s always the same line.
2021-05-04 10:14:53,wallstreetbets,It’s your cousin who’s the problem. Remove your cousins from NOK and by the end of the year they’re at $50.
2021-05-04 15:49:34,wallstreetbets,":)) I can afford a few downvotes. OP is right, NOK is undervalued, but it's not for me."
2021-05-04 16:44:41,wallstreetbets,Cut them bags bro. Take it from a long time NOK trader from years ago.

2021-05-04 13:12:13,wallstreetbets,Are the other half on a different sub?
2021-05-04 10:15:37,wallstreetbets,I’m up roughly 17%
2021-05-04 11:02:54,wallstreetbets,Board has approval to buyback 550M shares which is about 10% of float. Whether they will do it is anyone's guess. They certainly have the free cash to do so and would be a fairly quick way to return some value to shareholders. And considering the depressed price it makes sense to do so now.
2021-05-04 09:26:31,wallstreetbets,that or it can become a cheap ATT and pay fucking dividends =D
2021-05-04 09:18:19,wallstreetbets,Is this another job for reddit I smell... 🤔
2021-05-04 08:13:19,wallstreetbets,"Oh i went deep ITM and far out. Got Jan 2023 C2.50 for $2.50 in premium. If Nokia isn't at 5 bucks in 2 years, I'm okay with that. Meanwhile I'll chip away at the premium selling OTM PMCC..."

Scratch that. Guess I'm up ~15% as well. Though I consider that even LOL"
2021-05-04 16:25:22,wallstreetbets,restarting the dividends would be nice. tired of looking at 7 cents in movement each way every day.
2021-05-04 09:38:38,wallstreetbets,What was the first job?
2021-05-04 09:30:47,wallstreetbets,THIS! is the way. Only wish I had known about doing this a long time ago
2021-05-04 10:29:47,wallstreetbets,What strike and how far out are you gonna sell the PMCCs?
2021-05-04 12:33:51,wallstreetbets,Your cousin previous employer’s were Enron and Blockbuster?
2021-05-04 19:18:45,wallstreetbets,"Because for ten years it hasn't passed the $7 mark.

And technically its down -5% today so its not ""on the way up"".

Just my personal long term experience with NOK going back to 2011. Its a flatlined dead horse. Hope you do good with it though"
2021-05-04 16:43:52,wallstreetbets,"Ah, the DDDs"
2021-05-04 10:50:05,wallstreetbets,Hand...
2021-05-04 12:23:20,wallstreetbets,"Lol. Im a majorly risk-adverse pussy:

Long: Jan 2023 C 2.50 for 2.50 debit.
Short: 6/18/21 C 5.50 for 0.12 credit.

Doesn't seem like a lot, but that's a 5% ROI. I don't mind waiting and repeating every 6 weeks or closing for 75% max profit. If you wanna be more aggressive, you can go down to $5 short strikes. If price blows past short strike, you wont profit much, but you just close out the entire position for net even or small profit and repeat cuz lol NOKIA is range bound AF. As you lock in more profits from the CC, it hurts even less to close out entire position. 

Nokia - IV is pretty shit right now, so premiums aren't great, but it's cool. This is death by 1000 cuts. If I can make 3-5% every 6 weeks, that's still a decent 20%-40% per year. 

If Nokia goes down, then the CC premiums and long DTE gives me time to wriggle and minimize my loss."

Even if it doesn’t moon you aren’t really risking anything by buying at these prices. How often to high reward low risk stocks come around? This is a great opportunity

2021-05-04 19:39:09,wallstreetbets,Literally everybody in the sector has blown away 1st quarter earnings and RKT is the industry leader.
2021-05-04 12:18:37,wallstreetbets,"Buts that’s because there are only like two houses for sale, normally there was lots of turn over. 

People are using cheap money to buy houses, and the people that bought previously are not selling.

So while companies that take a percentage from the sale are making more on a transactional basis they are not doing as many houses.

It’s nuts my market has less than a months supply of houses."

2021-05-04 13:49:01,wallstreetbets,"For a guy that prides himself on personal finance successes, that's some retard math right there. Let me pose it as a question. What's the better trade: 

(A) Your 4/16 AAL Puts 

(B) My 5/7 RKT Calls

I'll wait patiently for your answer."
2021-05-04 18:29:53,wallstreetbets,Gonna hold all of them threw earning? I’m up like 20% too
2021-05-04 19:19:46,wallstreetbets,Just checked the IRA.   Those RKT calls are 144% up and are holding through earnings.  They are further out expiration
2021-05-04 18:35:26,wallstreetbets,already sold for well over 100% and bought more shares
2021-05-04 19:27:14,wallstreetbets,"Ah good luck I’m
Holding mine to unless I get over 100% gains then I will sell half for risk management"
2021-05-04 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,RKT I’m in. 
2021-05-04 09:10:00,wallstreetbets,"Ah, ole RKT. The one option I actually where I actually left a fuck on of money on the table with. 

Bought two option contracts $172, set to expire at the end of the week, about 30 hours later that two contracts were worth $3100 - strike price rose from .86 to 16.55.

Because I’m not a paper handed bitch I hung on to my calls and figured RKT was gonna hit $40 by Friday. What instead happened was that shit plummeted. Instead of selling for three grand I ended up selling for $150 or something like that."
2021-05-04 08:22:40,wallstreetbets,"22,000 shares! Wa wa wee wa!"

2021-05-04 15:24:19,wallstreetbets,Agree. Best part is zero downside risk at these prices. It’s already proven strong support around $22 for 2 months now. High reward potential without high risk. I’m in.
2021-05-04 08:05:40,wallstreetbets,Could've just bought the dip but this was pretty retarded and i like it

Thought we'd see a little run up going into earnings but literally its like groundhogs day watching this.

And it all happened so gradually over the last three months that I'd hardly noticed. I just wish people who hadn't been a part of WSB or at least lurked before GME would fuck off. Like a Great Purge.

I'm well aware that my decisions to buy speculative stocks can bite me in the ass. I don't need *your dumb ass* to reiterate that which is already an understood concept.

Now let's hope this market opens fuckin' green for once. Godspeed, fellow dicks."

2021-05-04 06:50:26,wallstreetbets,"Stock futures are mostly flat this morning. Tech is seeing a bit of selling, with the Nasdaq off 0.3%.

This follows a day of reopening optimism that lifted retail stocks. New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut will fully re-open on May 19. Florida is open effective immediately.

So the rotation trade is apparently back. Not much in the way of economic data today. Factory orders at 0830. We do have a bunch of earnings: CVS and DuPont just beat. Later we have Pfizer, Activision Blizzard, Akamai, and some oil majors: ConocoPhillips, Marathon Petroleum, Dominion Energy, Devon Energy. 

Oil is up this morning, by the way. Crude up 1.8% to $65.50, another post-pandemic high.

Looks like things might be melting up. Sell in May and go away at your peril. Not sure there was ever any real basis for that anyway. Just sounds good."

As I lick my wounds among the newly cash gang I will say one thing:

I am no expert in this regard, so don't come to me for relationship advice.

Fidelity just released their beta update for their app and it is infinitely better than before.  Has similar feel to Robinhood in terms of simplicity of use and actually provides way more data than RH does.

Also - Fidelity wont bend you over prison shower style when you catch a short squeeze unlike RH.  Check it out and stop posting gain/loss porn with your Robinhood account.

“But these are investments our economy needs to be competitive and productive,” she added.

Though she said the U.S. needs to focus on fiscal responsibility longer term, she said spending on matters central to the government’s mission has been ignored for too long.

Inflation concerns have arisen due to all the spending and the rapid growth, but Fed officials have said that after a brief rise this year, price pressures are likely to ebb."

2021-05-04 15:29:19,wallstreetbets, Its probably been said before but if everyone using RH keeps their account until RH goes public then this is what can happen....Wait until options become available and do long puts ON A DIFFERENT brokerage. Then in mass everyone deletes their account so RH has little-to-no users. I'm no expert autist but this would ruin their business.

2021-05-04 13:22:35,wallstreetbets,Yellen said that rates *may* have to rise *somewhat*. Which has always been the case. This is nothing new. It’s just that the government officials are now starting to admit the truth. Interest rates rising and inflation are unavoidable at this point.  Doesn’t mean it’s happening anytime this year though

Even if it doesn’t moon you still own a great company at the very bottom. It was about to explode this morning before Janet opened her mouth. When it does get volume and  move it’ll be hard and fast.

2021-05-04 12:37:31,wallstreetbets,"The sub originated as basically trust fund babies yoloing their money on options, so a lot of what’s popular in the sub is driven by those people. Look at DFV for example, dude made a fuck ton but he also had $750k sitting around to dump into it."
2021-05-04 13:37:17,wallstreetbets,Exactly. Suddenly the tech dump from the last few days makes more sense.

2021-05-04 15:06:36,wallstreetbets,She suggested that the fed may need to raise interest rates.
2021-05-04 15:08:31,wallstreetbets,Bottom line : She said interest rates may have to rise which means tech sell off
2021-05-04 15:09:55,wallstreetbets,She said interest rates. Mouthed the word froth but didnt say it out loud. Said inflation. Market just wanted a reason to sell in May really
2021-05-04 15:32:33,wallstreetbets,My RKT calls were up big this AM. Fortunately I sold. Now it's time to rebuy.

2021-05-04 10:05:05,wallstreetbets,Something Ive learned. Itll serve you well
2021-05-04 10:14:52,wallstreetbets,"Rotation out of tech due to poorer outlook on the chip shortage / worries about inflation and supply chain issues not going away as quickly as expected. On top of that, the stimmy cheques seem to have gone more into people’s savings than had been anticipted, so the impact that has had on inflation may take longer to go away than previously thought. To top it all off, the market did not react much to recent earnings beats, and the lackluster response suggests an asymetrical risk/reward profile in the market where good news means little compared to bad news. 

None of this has affected certain canine assets except to make them more appealing by making the dollar less appealing if you buy the inflation argument. Who’s a good boy?"
2021-05-04 10:16:54,wallstreetbets,"Not yet, I think we could see another day or two, another 3-4% down.  Inflation fears aren't going away."
2021-05-04 10:29:02,wallstreetbets,Is the dip over cause it feels like the dip is still dipping.
2021-05-04 10:52:56,wallstreetbets,"This is not a normal market. Normal market means good performing stocks go up, not down on record quarters. Market is far from normalized."

2021-05-04 12:47:12,wallstreetbets,Bullshit in late 1920s margin over 90% wasn't uncommon.  Maybe total dollar amount but not % wise.
2021-05-04 12:57:10,wallstreetbets,Sounds like a politician.
2021-05-04 12:57:46,wallstreetbets,Yellen never knows what the hell she's talking about.
2021-05-04 12:59:25,wallstreetbets,"You are really over thinking this.

Economy growing too fast is bad so she says we may need to slow it down.

Economy growing at a rate that is globally competitive is good and infrastructure helps that.

2021-05-03 23:44:35,wallstreetbets,I did. But then I bought back in at $26 and it effectively wiped out my prior gains

2021-05-04 07:24:14,wallstreetbets,"ItS a LoNg HoLd....

But in all seriousness. It is a long hold and thinking you're going to make shit loads over a few weeks just isn't going to happen when they still haven't turned a profit yet. That said, if they announce next week they're profitable, we should see some movement. Regardless of my heavy bags, I'm averaging down when I can because I like the stock and think Karp is a giga brain chad."
2021-05-04 01:02:31,wallstreetbets,"1700->10k on calls in jan. Took pause, bought in at 26 and have sold calls on it since to lower avg. Down about 5% though. U right, lol"
2021-05-04 05:04:36,wallstreetbets,"Price goes to 21-22. 

Buy reasonable calls 2-4 week expiry

2021-05-04 05:50:19,wallstreetbets,"I have, it’s an absolutely fantastic swing trade. I shorted like 5 days ago at around 24, got out yesterday at 21.5 or so, made quite a lot of profit. Gonna buy again when it reaches the (probable) bottom of around 20, then will sell at 24, then short again at 24, then buy again.

Mean reverting stocks which are predictable like PLTR are ridiculously amazing.

Eventually it will stop mean reverting, but for now it’s a really simple process of shorting-buying-shorting."

They created a similar network in Israel before bringing the tech this way."

2021-05-04 12:28:09,wallstreetbets,"Yeah they have. In November alot of people made profit off of pltr ipo it was trading for $10 for almost a month after ipo. Back then wsb only had like 1.5 million subs or something. People who bought 25+ dollar mark are bag holding atm, but pltr is a long term play rn. It's going to be at least a couple years."
2021-05-04 05:38:33,wallstreetbets,Bro im pretty sure you can do that
2021-05-04 12:33:42,wallstreetbets,"... um average down then. 

This is the perfect time. Buy what you can, average down. And forget about it. In a year or two, it should hopefully be green. If not, then wait some more. All anyone can do right now. 

Or go all in and sell covered calls."
2021-05-04 08:59:23,wallstreetbets,Im at 31 something...

2021-05-04 09:01:00,wallstreetbets,Bro I’m slowly working my way up to 100 shares in my IRA. I’m broke as fuck but after every shift I put the money I make in tips into PLTR. So I’m picking up 3-4 shares 4 days a week. I don’t mind it staying in the 22-24 range for a bit longer so I can keep slowly loading up

2021-05-03 23:49:13,wallstreetbets,I thought you were being serious for a second. Is there anyone this subreddit that is actually serious about making money?
2021-05-03 23:55:00,wallstreetbets,Waste of time next time post something worth it

2021-05-04 00:09:43,wallstreetbets,"I remember The Price is Right, or some shit, had Bill on the show for about 5 minutes. 
He had to guess the price of everyday household items. The more items he guessed ""within range"" the more money was goin to be donated to ""his charity.""
He was about $10-$20 off on almost every item. 

Point being is - Billy G don't know shit about the world any of us live in. We don't know shit about the world he lives in. He probably is having orgies with pleiadians.

Long story short - this don't mean shit."

2021-05-04 10:30:50,wallstreetbets,Serious questions.  What are the tax implications of this strategy?  Will this cancel out my WSB losses.  Would the taxes implications depend upon how long my wife's marriages with gates lasts?  If I get margin called on my mortage and Bill bails me out do I owe taxes?

2021-05-04 07:52:50,wallstreetbets,Good example of how a short term loss becomes a long term hold. Been there. I have a 7 year loss that is about to be wiped out with 1 yr old gains. Good news: no tax on the gains. Bad news: 7 yrs no revenue on the loss.
2021-05-04 07:53:00,wallstreetbets,"I think the reason of the bloody red at your portfolio is that you do not hold GME and AMC🚀🚀🚀, therefore sell whole this shit and buy GME and AMC then you will see GREEN MOON"
2021-05-04 07:59:46,wallstreetbets,I always wondered why I liked red over green as a young kid. Now I know why!
2021-05-04 08:09:59,wallstreetbets,Congratulations!
2021-05-04 08:10:48,wallstreetbets,Red light means stop on the road but it means keep buying in WSB.

2021-05-04 08:20:03,wallstreetbets,"My account went more green yesterday, so yes."
2021-05-04 08:24:32,wallstreetbets,Monopoly money...

2021-05-04 08:32:01,wallstreetbets,How does he have different lots? Are you doing different tax allocation?
2021-05-04 08:36:15,wallstreetbets,LUL cashed out last Thursday from all tech stocks.
2021-05-04 08:40:31,wallstreetbets,But why? Who’s going under ?

2021-05-04 09:24:53,wallstreetbets,"Ooh SPCE. You have really got to admire the balls on their c suite. Years of significant losses coupled with a total abcense of test flights. And they still keep posting about their rockets that never leave the ground. 

What a scam"
2021-05-04 09:27:18,wallstreetbets,Wait till you see what Tuesday has in store for us
2021-05-04 09:28:08,wallstreetbets, But that 6.66% is a sign 😈 just do a few ritualistic sacrifices before market opens and you will be just fine haha.

2021-05-04 09:39:38,wallstreetbets,"U feel bad for you,  I hope it rebounds for you. I'm going to look at these stock picks though. I'm trying to learn how to do this stuff. Thanks for sharing!"
2021-05-04 09:39:40,wallstreetbets,"fucking hell, the whole market is red for almost everyone. Meanwhile you've got all these cyptos just going to the fucking moon for no reason."

2021-05-04 09:43:37,wallstreetbets,Oh you in AYX too. That shit is probably the worst stock I've been holding since 2 yrs
2021-05-04 09:44:24,wallstreetbets,We are all red lol
2021-05-04 09:50:26,wallstreetbets,"Curious what offset most of that, since the total loss shows as slightly less than the first item."
2021-05-04 09:54:10,wallstreetbets,About as much as I'm enjoying tuesday...
2021-05-04 09:56:51,wallstreetbets,Try to look today for more red digits

2021-05-04 10:31:40,wallstreetbets,Looks like today is going to be even better!
2021-05-04 10:35:00,wallstreetbets,How do you deal with this? Too much stress for me. I need to pay a guy to take care of my shit. I can’t deal with seeing that all day. Put it in someone else’s hands to make the right move and keep me from losing my hair.
2021-05-04 10:39:58,wallstreetbets,The market does not use vaseline
2021-05-04 10:40:02,wallstreetbets,"Down 6%, that’s great."

2021-05-04 19:10:54,wallstreetbets,"Haha, sorry man. I'm right there with you. I loaded up on SPACs a few months ago and it's been a slow downward spiral ever since. I'm down about 50k. Not as bad as your loss, but I feel your pain. 

Only thing that brings me comfort is knowing I'm holding my positions until at least next summer. I'm confident things will get better by then. Stay strong."

2021-05-04 19:35:54,wallstreetbets,"Trying to share a school project, professor said we probably couldn't get 100 views, so we're aiming to get 1,000 views. We're at SUNY Oswego and we're trying to meme this. Let's get this to the moon unlike this man's portfolio.

2021-05-04 19:36:21,wallstreetbets,And I was annoyed about being down 0.7%... That’s a lot of red.
2021-05-04 19:37:46,wallstreetbets,"I use night mode and colorblind mode just to mix it up sometimes, feels like a whole new game"
2021-05-04 19:40:48,wallstreetbets,Just remember most millionaires are created when markets crash!!
2021-05-04 19:45:28,wallstreetbets,I’m doing the same red color but on a much smaller scale
2021-05-03 21:44:12,wallstreetbets,Probably not the same kinda $$ but yeah pretty same colour theme. Not too fazed. What goes down must come up. Catch the falling knife and load up to average down. Not financial advice. DYOR😉
2021-05-03 21:58:52,wallstreetbets,At least your tax liability will be lower
2021-05-03 22:53:16,wallstreetbets,"Awesome pics. Great size. Look thick. Solid. Tight. Keep us all posted on your continued progress with any new progress pics or vid clips. Show us what you got. Wanna see how freakn' huge, solid, thick and tight you can get. Thanks for the motivation."
2021-05-03 22:21:37,wallstreetbets,Hold SKLZ
2021-05-03 22:22:12,wallstreetbets,Nice work
2021-05-03 22:29:22,wallstreetbets,"Get ready for the shit show, gonna double those red numbers!!!  

Wealthy families could face combined tax rates of as much as 61% on inherited wealth under President Joe Biden’s tax plan, according to a recent analysis and tax accountants.

2021-05-03 22:44:42,wallstreetbets,I too was red ass raped.
2021-05-03 22:46:49,wallstreetbets,Can you like help me with college debt? damn 😂
2021-05-03 22:53:35,wallstreetbets,"Stonks only go up, buy the dip retard 💎🙌🏽 🦍"
2021-05-04 13:43:40,wallstreetbets,This is because WSB is divided and still hung up on the GME/AMC/PLTR trade. If apes stuck together with one stock and then move to the next target we would be retired by now.
2021-05-04 19:51:48,wallstreetbets,All trash stocks you deserve to lose lol
2021-05-03 22:00:24,wallstreetbets,So much red my eyes are bleeding
2021-05-04 01:01:03,wallstreetbets,"Kinda wish I was colorblind, it might be less painful"
2021-05-03 23:39:49,wallstreetbets,I knew there was a reason I don't wake up before 3pm anymore.
2021-05-04 07:35:51,wallstreetbets,Mine is a little purpley red.. like off white.. but off red a little 💥
2021-05-04 08:29:17,wallstreetbets,If you invert colours on the app it doesn't seem so bad.
2021-05-04 10:54:12,wallstreetbets,Wait Reddit lied .I was assured by random internet users that STONKS ONLY GO UP lol
2021-05-04 11:12:43,wallstreetbets,So much red I thought this was the red ranger special episode
2021-05-04 12:08:52,wallstreetbets,There’s so much red in my portfolio it looks like my eyes after crying myself to sleep
2021-05-04 13:17:16,wallstreetbets,Yeah man same. I’m down 4% which is about ~$30! Someday I will have actual tendies to lose
2021-05-04 05:20:47,wallstreetbets,Which app is it?
2021-05-04 19:50:29,wallstreetbets,soon the time will come and we can suck on the moon's titties
2021-05-04 01:04:05,wallstreetbets,"It will reverse, but damn it’s painful to watch"
2021-05-04 08:56:05,wallstreetbets,"It's only a 6.66% loss, it's fine. That can totally be made up the next day."
2021-05-03 22:45:20,wallstreetbets,It ain’t a loss if you don’t sell...
2021-05-04 01:20:49,wallstreetbets,The 666 money demon enters the chat.
2021-05-04 00:01:48,wallstreetbets,The number of the beast! The end of days are upon us!
2021-05-04 06:22:43,wallstreetbets,"That happened with MVIS last week.  Margin requirement increased so I closed all my positions early.  

I was sad taking about 75% of the profit I thought I had, but it went deep in the red the next morning.  Dodged a bullet"
2021-05-03 22:21:56,wallstreetbets,Why was this me this morning? haha. I hate it here.
2021-05-04 01:03:43,wallstreetbets,You definitely don’t want to get too deep into margin in this market. I like losing real money. Lol
2021-05-03 22:53:20,wallstreetbets,Why would you be called
2021-05-04 01:06:12,wallstreetbets,I like a good even loss.
2021-05-03 23:03:48,wallstreetbets,"I saw PLTR on there, that position is staying red lol."
2021-05-04 01:05:20,wallstreetbets,I agree with you. I think I’ll post again when this is green. Let’s see how long that takes :)
2021-05-03 23:43:04,wallstreetbets,These are call options...zooming out won’t save him/her
2021-05-04 01:34:26,wallstreetbets,"SPCE is in a poor position long term. They had an early mover advantage that was wasted by the crash, and now Blue Origin has caught up and will start selling suborbital rides this week.

Meanwhile SpaceX is trying to build a cruise ship compared to Virgin’s dinghy rides. Once they start selling orbital and lunar cruises towards the middle of the decade then the suborbital market will likely collapse."
2021-05-04 07:46:44,wallstreetbets,"No, it’s a shit business model and will run out of cash before it becomes mainstream. Heavy R&D like that needs government subsidies/contracts, not individuals paying $250k for a flight."
2021-05-04 09:02:25,wallstreetbets,"To give you the non-SpaceX bootlicker perspective, you're still kinda fucked. The recent pullbacks have been bad headlines that really aren't that bad if you actually read the story (e.g. ""BRANSON SOLD HIS SPCE STAKE"" - he sold less than 10% to move money to his businesses that were hit by Covid; ""SPCE DELAYS EARNINGS TO FIX ACCOUNTING PROBLEMS"" - the SEC put out new guidance for handling warrants right before they were due to report).

In the short term, if they actually have a successful test flight you'll probably see $30 again the next day. If they cancel again you may see $10. For the long term you might as well roll some dice. $45 is a long way off - if you really wanna play this you're gonna want to average down"
2021-05-04 10:52:20,wallstreetbets,SKLZ payed me $30 to install some stupid fucking card game and play a round. I guess that counts as customer acquisition LOL
2021-05-04 02:04:25,wallstreetbets,Sklz makes shitty flash games? I don’t understand how this is a multi billion dollar company.. where is the big idea/product here?
2021-05-04 13:08:31,wallstreetbets,"Sorry, you missed the top buddy"
2021-05-04 13:50:16,wallstreetbets,Back to where?
2021-05-04 00:20:24,wallstreetbets,Idk man doesn’t even feel like loss porn when someone has 600K in their account? Down 6% in this market doesn’t at all feel crazy. But then it’s up 10% the next day.
2021-05-04 01:44:31,wallstreetbets,"Finally, I’ve found you. I honestly am baffled by this stock. I’ve been buying it down for the longest time. I’ve bought and sold the others shown here a couple times for profit, but AYX has brought zero profit. But I have enough of it now that the profit will be decent (if it ever budges). It’s a good company and a good stock, so I guess we wait this one out"
2021-05-04 01:06:38,wallstreetbets,"Lol, thank you. But wait .... there’s more"
2021-05-04 00:08:19,wallstreetbets,not if you plan on ever retiring.
2021-05-04 04:12:47,wallstreetbets,Why so many people feel the urge to bet all of their money in only one sector? In my opinion even day traders can benefit from diversification and asset allocation.
2021-05-04 12:11:12,wallstreetbets,"I’m gobsmacked by the concentration of some of these portfolios. 100% Tech SPAC, no mature tech stocks, no REIT, no commodity, no consumer goods, no dividends."
2021-05-04 02:49:15,wallstreetbets,Diversifying is overrated
2021-05-03 22:54:10,wallstreetbets,A right of passage. She simply evolved.
2021-05-03 22:44:18,wallstreetbets,"Nah, this is retarded!"
2021-05-04 01:09:09,wallstreetbets,"It’s ok, my YTD numbers are good. I bought/sold SKLZ for $25k profit. Rebought lower but still too high. So now I’m down but I’m not worried about that one. I’ve bought and sold SPLK multiple times for profit. But this time it won’t budge. That one was like a no brainer, but it has died on me now."
2021-05-04 01:44:35,wallstreetbets,That's ATVI - not on the list... but they have also had a really rough month.
2021-05-04 01:09:31,wallstreetbets,I have a vault of all red ones
2021-05-04 01:18:59,wallstreetbets,Now that is nice!
2021-05-04 09:58:21,wallstreetbets,I absolutely agree with you. I want to buy more but I don’t want to get in any deeper. There has to be a point where you stop throwing money at a stock. But I may have no choice here. I’ve got to get that average down. I’m so glad you see the same value I do in the company. I’d love to know why the price continues to drop.
2021-05-04 01:10:13,wallstreetbets,Don’t you love it when one superstar saves the day? So much less painful
2021-05-03 22:12:49,wallstreetbets,Parabolic
2021-05-03 22:05:34,wallstreetbets,Ya'll act like that's hard to do. 🤷‍♂️
2021-05-04 01:13:48,wallstreetbets,I agree. And I’m going to repost when I am. Let’s hope that’s soon :)
2021-05-04 01:20:30,wallstreetbets,Good question!
2021-05-04 01:26:52,wallstreetbets,Happy to help
2021-05-04 01:48:49,wallstreetbets,I like you
2021-05-04 01:16:20,wallstreetbets,"I’ll loan it to you, but you have to pay me back. 50% reverse interest seems fair. So you’ll just owe me $125k. Fair?"
2021-05-04 01:12:01,wallstreetbets,Ha ha ha ... real estate. There’s been a lot of buying and selling prior to this point. Now it’s just a bit of a wait
2021-05-03 22:45:04,wallstreetbets,You clearly aren't about the tech stock life.
2021-05-03 22:03:49,wallstreetbets,Them maybe I should proud of my 💯% red portfolio if it's so rare?
2021-05-04 01:16:48,wallstreetbets,That’s not all of it. Just what fit in the screenshot. There’s so so much more lol
2021-05-04 00:32:57,wallstreetbets,Not the whole portfolio.  Total daily loss is 42k so there’s gains offsetting most of the loss here.  Still brutal but not as bad
2021-05-04 01:12:23,wallstreetbets,Did you paint it red? Who had a foyer? That’s fancy
2021-05-04 01:13:18,wallstreetbets,"I played SPLK about three times for nice profits and this time it sunk and stayed down. I’m probably even on the year, but I need this one to budge so I can jump out."
2021-05-04 01:19:13,wallstreetbets,There will be no margin call.
2021-05-04 01:23:11,wallstreetbets,I haven’t lost half a million. I’m only down... today.
2021-05-04 01:24:43,wallstreetbets,"Good luck to you! This only shows my losses today, not overall, and doesn’t show profit I’ve taken through the year already. It’s not as grim as it looks, all is just fine. You just can’t panic about losses."
2021-05-04 01:25:00,wallstreetbets,That one burnt a lot of people
2021-05-04 01:15:11,wallstreetbets,"Oh geeez, just rent the bottom floor and jump out that window if you get desperate. I do think this will all turn around. The market shifts so quickly."
2021-05-04 01:25:35,wallstreetbets,Ouch :/
2021-05-04 01:31:16,wallstreetbets,It was a pretty bad day for all
2021-05-04 01:38:03,wallstreetbets,"Please, take me with you."
2021-05-04 01:46:50,wallstreetbets,"Thanks, it will turn around, it always does... eventually"
2021-05-04 01:49:10,wallstreetbets,Macy’s huh? Nicely done.
2021-05-04 01:49:51,wallstreetbets,I want you on my team!
2021-05-04 01:55:37,wallstreetbets,This would be true.... if my entire portfolio fit into one screenshot. I just sorted by loss.
2021-05-03 23:18:30,wallstreetbets,That guys all over the map
2021-05-04 02:02:34,wallstreetbets,"I know! It keeps getting close to my break even and then drops. It’s not a bad company, but it may be a bit of a wait to see the price come up"
2021-05-04 02:05:11,wallstreetbets,"Aww, well don’t be sad because my YTD profit is up. I’ve bought and sold SKLZ and SPLK a couple times for profit. And this is not the extent of my portfolio, just a screenshot. These will all bounce back, I’m not worried at all. So we can both be happy"
2021-05-04 02:05:45,wallstreetbets,I know right
2021-05-04 02:08:19,wallstreetbets,That is loyalty!!!
2021-05-04 02:08:52,wallstreetbets,It’s been a lot of waiting and buying down. I’m ready for some selling
2021-05-04 02:31:11,wallstreetbets,"I’ve done so poorly with options, I think I can time the market but I really just can’t"
2021-05-04 10:39:42,wallstreetbets,It was a brutal day. Monday’s seem to always be rough.
2021-05-04 10:29:20,wallstreetbets,Me. All. Day.
2021-05-04 10:25:27,wallstreetbets,I like you
2021-05-04 10:17:27,wallstreetbets,"It will come back, it always does. But waiting out the lows are a bit painful"
2021-05-04 10:15:38,wallstreetbets,Best advice on this thread
2021-05-04 11:34:38,wallstreetbets,I think it will definitely recover
2021-05-04 01:17:47,wallstreetbets,Oh I’m holding. It will turn around.
2021-05-04 00:02:48,wallstreetbets,"red on the noodle, like a dick on a poodle"
2021-05-04 01:19:48,wallstreetbets,It’s a couple accounts combined. These are just the top losers that fit in the screenshot. I have boring stuff too.
2021-05-04 01:25:22,wallstreetbets,"Ha ha ha same same same. I keep thinking this is the bottom,  but nope."
2021-05-04 01:25:44,wallstreetbets,Ugh :/
2021-05-04 01:26:10,wallstreetbets,No heart attacks... it will recover
2021-05-04 01:26:36,wallstreetbets,"No shit. With all of that, I’m thinking breaking even is now a win."
2021-05-04 01:30:51,wallstreetbets,It definitely will. My number losses are big but overall % change isn’t that far off. This market changes quickly.
2021-05-04 01:31:31,wallstreetbets,"I did, I do and I will. I have no choice lol"
2021-05-04 01:33:56,wallstreetbets,This is just today. I am up nicely YTD overall. But this little gang of stocks is starting to irritate me.
2021-05-04 01:36:02,wallstreetbets,I’ve got some demons to cast out. Be gone
2021-05-04 01:36:28,wallstreetbets,TDA
2021-05-04 01:36:56,wallstreetbets,nice!
2021-05-04 01:37:51,wallstreetbets,But it takes even more skill to sell every stock that goes down
2021-05-04 01:44:55,wallstreetbets,"Done it, doing it, continuing to ...."
2021-05-03 23:44:35,wallstreetbets,"Fwiw pennystocks don’t really exist in terms of a one in a million find anymore. IPO’s are all so damn high after being jacked up on VC money for years leading to IPO. With that said, finding a promising one is still possible. Use a screener. Someone here surely knows of one. I find mine my just browsing and buying on the idea. $SEOVF is my latest. Long holds."
2021-05-04 01:45:44,wallstreetbets,"There is a while sub for penny stocks, you won’t find that here. Just do a general search"
2021-05-04 01:46:18,wallstreetbets,You mean to tell me it’s ~not~ going to the moon?
2021-05-04 01:48:38,wallstreetbets,Honestly it’s true. My numbers are big but the % aren’t that far off. A $3 move up for SKLZ puts me back at even. Sometimes you just have to wait it out.
2021-05-04 01:49:24,wallstreetbets,Temporary damage.
2021-05-04 01:55:52,wallstreetbets,Lololol that one was pretty good
2021-05-04 01:56:41,wallstreetbets,"Yep, it moves so rapidly. I’ve been buying and selling same day just to take quick gains. But these suckers don’t want to move"
2021-05-04 01:57:03,wallstreetbets,I’m not worried about that one at all. It will come back.
2021-05-04 01:57:52,wallstreetbets,I bought GME once and sold it 45 minutes later for a $13k gain. Lol. That one almost gave me a heart attack.
2021-05-04 02:08:29,wallstreetbets,Maybe next time
2021-05-04 00:43:13,wallstreetbets,Save 10-15% every time you get paid. Invest it. Profit.
2021-05-04 00:26:47,wallstreetbets,"Oh my gourd!

2021-05-04 01:04:21,wallstreetbets,[removed]
2021-05-04 02:10:19,wallstreetbets,Ha ha... well it’s not lost. It’s just temporarily missing.
2021-05-04 02:12:02,wallstreetbets,"To be honest, I have bought and sold SPLK three times for profit. This time when I rebought, it did not recover. So I have to wait. But it paid nicely in my other trades. It’s not a bad company, it is undervalued right now. I expect and decent rise in the next six months."
2021-05-04 02:12:24,wallstreetbets,Fair point....
2021-05-04 02:32:47,wallstreetbets,"Ha ha, if you want advice on how to lose money, I’m your girl"
2021-05-04 02:32:05,wallstreetbets,Three accounts. But this is actually the third time I’ve had sklz. Bought and sold two other times for profit. But now it’s being stubborn.
2021-05-04 02:30:36,wallstreetbets,Oh I’m just showing you the good stuff. It’s a screenshot sorted by loss. You aren’t seeing the whole thing.
2021-05-04 02:28:41,wallstreetbets,"I think it’s a good company and the price makes no sense to me at all. So I’m holding for sure. If like a $120 exit point, that feels about right. But we will see..."
2021-05-04 02:27:20,wallstreetbets,AMD is a good stock to own though.
2021-05-04 02:25:54,wallstreetbets,"It would be hard to kick me in the nuts since I’m a girl. But thanks for the offer, I think."
2021-05-04 02:24:04,wallstreetbets,"Honestly... I bought GME once, held it for 45 minutes and sold for a $13k profit."
2021-05-04 02:23:07,wallstreetbets,Oh no. That’s brutal. Hopefully it will bounce back for you quickly.
2021-05-04 02:21:41,wallstreetbets,He is a she. And I‘ve been investing a long time in the market and real estate. It takes time...
2021-05-04 02:22:24,wallstreetbets,No chance I’m taking a loss on PLTR. I refuse.
2021-05-04 02:34:16,wallstreetbets,Me too. I think it will
2021-05-04 02:39:41,wallstreetbets,"I like TDOC right now, it’s just expensive. I think it will do well."
2021-05-04 02:42:20,wallstreetbets,There wasn’t a flair for that

2021-05-04 10:34:35,wallstreetbets,Sorry :/ I feel you.
2021-05-04 10:34:13,wallstreetbets,You’re the best.
2021-05-04 10:34:01,wallstreetbets,"Good question. Probably a bit of a market correction, but it will come back"
2021-05-04 10:32:55,wallstreetbets,This girl gladly accepts
2021-05-04 10:31:34,wallstreetbets,They will recover. Already up $15k on SKLZ (for today). Profitable on some of my lower cost average buys so can let some go for profit. Market always turns around
2021-05-04 10:28:45,wallstreetbets,I was a little extra grumpy yesterday.
2021-05-04 10:28:30,wallstreetbets,Oh man... that’s a long long time to wait
2021-05-04 10:24:34,wallstreetbets,"I don’t actually. Just a mobile screenshot of my losers on the day. My meme stocks just took a dive at the same time. I had SKLZ a couple times, bought low and early. But this rebuy was too high (for now). 

You gotta admit, meme stocks are the most fun."
2021-05-04 10:22:09,wallstreetbets,"I had GME, set a high limit sell, it executed 45 minutes after I bought it for a nice gain. I got very lucky."
2021-05-04 10:21:06,wallstreetbets,SKLZ just made a nice turnaround in the time I was reading these comments. Lol. Now I’m up $10k on the day. Bizarre market we have here
2021-05-04 10:18:48,wallstreetbets,"I think they all will return nicely and when they do, it will be quick since the share count is so high. It looks worse than it is"
2021-05-04 10:16:53,wallstreetbets,Currently casting out demons....
2021-05-04 10:16:37,wallstreetbets,"Ha ha, no doubt."
2021-05-04 10:16:22,wallstreetbets,I was just thinking the same exact thing
2021-05-04 10:15:05,wallstreetbets,I’ve been in since the big drop in November which I thought would be the bottom. But I was very wrong. I don’t understand this one at all.
2021-05-04 09:55:04,wallstreetbets,"Should have waited til this morning to post, it’s even worse now. Lol"
2021-05-04 10:11:02,wallstreetbets,"I think you may be the one and only person to notice that. Everyone is calling me dumb and what not, but It’s just a mobile screenshot sorted by loss. I’ve got MSFT, NTDOY, BA, UPS. Other sectors did well."
2021-05-04 09:56:17,wallstreetbets,Feels like Monday just never ended.
2021-05-04 10:47:58,wallstreetbets,Apparently so!
2021-05-04 10:47:50,wallstreetbets,"I will for sure. SKLZ up $10k for the day right now. Will change quickly I’m sure. Up or down, who knows. But these will all recover and everything will be just fine"
2021-05-04 10:46:50,wallstreetbets,SKLZ doing an about face ... nice to see.
2021-05-04 10:46:17,wallstreetbets,Nice! That’s great :)
2021-05-04 10:46:01,wallstreetbets,"Yes, I’m with you on that!!"
2021-05-04 10:45:38,wallstreetbets,"Lol. First of all, I’m a girl. Secondly you are not seeing all of my holdings, just a screenshot sorted by loss. Thirdly, I’m not bragging, I lost quite a lot for the day, as many people did. 

Yes it’s a lot of money, but it’s relative. Trust me, there are many people on this sub who have a lot more than I do...."
2021-05-04 10:42:12,wallstreetbets,"I’ve bought and sold these stocks a couple times along the way, and my portfolio is well diversified. This is just my day losses. My YTD earnings are good. And this whole market turns quickly. I’m not up $12k for the day on SKLZ. In addition, it’s not money I “need” to live my daily life, so I can be patient."
2021-05-04 10:55:42,wallstreetbets,"Lol, I wish."
2021-05-04 11:00:05,wallstreetbets,"Actually, probably. If I had a lot more money to throw at these, I’d do it. But I’m just annoyed at this point"
2021-05-04 12:42:03,wallstreetbets,"KangGang, ThetaGang, RedGang"
2021-05-04 12:41:34,wallstreetbets,up $12k on SKLZ for the day.... so at least I got that going for me. lol
2021-05-04 11:35:23,wallstreetbets,Yeah I woke up to that alert on my phone. I set that alert so I’d know when to buy more if it fell. Not a fun way to wake up :/
2021-05-04 13:16:58,wallstreetbets,Market is going to fall by 10%
2021-05-04 15:56:08,wallstreetbets,I feel that
2021-05-04 17:53:30,wallstreetbets,That’s a good dinner even on an up day
2021-05-04 17:53:08,wallstreetbets,He is :)
2021-05-04 19:38:03,wallstreetbets,I have never even heard of that company.
2021-05-04 19:37:09,wallstreetbets,"That is correct. Several of the new proposed policies are doing some damage to the market. ~ not making a political statement in terms of what’s right or wrong, don’t even want to touch that subject"
2021-05-04 19:35:26,wallstreetbets,"Lol, maybe playboy?"
2021-05-04 02:13:05,wallstreetbets,I agree with you. It will come back.
2021-05-04 02:13:49,wallstreetbets,"Lol... that’s only if I sell, which I’m definitely not going to do."
2021-05-03 22:56:42,wallstreetbets,"In 4 years, when a new president comes into office, everything will change again."
2021-05-04 02:14:49,wallstreetbets,Taxes are going to be such a nightmare. I’ll lose way more in taxes than I’ll ever lose here.
2021-05-04 15:38:24,wallstreetbets,The first rule of WSB is .....
2021-05-03 22:43:59,wallstreetbets,Glad I'm not the only one needing self revive rn ☠🥱
2021-05-03 22:23:39,wallstreetbets,"I tried turning my phone upside down, but I just hit my head."
2021-05-04 05:09:34,wallstreetbets,"You can use a Japanese broker. for some reason they flip the colors. green down, red up. so confusing. Get astigmatism so you can miss the minus."
2021-05-04 08:54:28,wallstreetbets,A medium grey would be nice.
2021-05-04 16:25:46,wallstreetbets,"Of course it will, such a well-diversified portfolio surely will rebound."
2021-05-04 05:32:47,wallstreetbets,Wouldn't count on SKLZ reversing. It's a toxic stock that **deserves** to delist. Typical SPAC hopium crack-rock hours valuation and nothing to support it.
2021-05-04 06:43:56,wallstreetbets,Will it? Lol
2021-05-04 07:38:38,wallstreetbets,"> It will reverse

You sure about that, bud?"
2021-05-03 23:25:48,wallstreetbets,Buy the dip!
2021-05-03 23:16:49,wallstreetbets,That is what I am counting on!  LOL
2021-05-04 01:01:54,wallstreetbets,Exactly.
2021-05-04 08:56:57,wallstreetbets,So short the Catholic church?
2021-05-04 03:06:02,wallstreetbets,The Catalyst is coming!
2021-05-03 23:00:34,wallstreetbets,"Margin called. If you don't have enough cash or your account isn't worth a set amount, it will scare the brokerage into forcing you to sell some positions so they can take some of their money back. It's how they hedge against you using margin.

Essentially, you buy stuff on credit, they think you aren't worth the trouble, so they take some or all of their money back."
2021-05-03 23:01:22,wallstreetbets,"theyre out on margin, and losing too much so their broker wants to pay themselves back and they'll sell his shit, my guess"
2021-05-04 08:45:17,wallstreetbets,SPCE as well. He's got a great price on it but they've started drilling for oil despite claiming to be a space tourism company
2021-05-04 00:36:14,wallstreetbets,Not a single one of those is a call option. Those are shares.
2021-05-04 08:52:53,wallstreetbets,"> Once they start selling orbital and lunar cruises towards the middle of the decade then the suborbital market will likely collapse.

This sentiment is tantamount to saying somebody living in London will never visit Paris because it isn't as far as Tokyo.

Sure, they're both travel, but one is much more intensive and people aren't always looking for the extreme. Factor in the fact that those orbital/lunar cruises will feel somewhere between camping and living in a greyhound for a couple days and I'm sure there will still be plenty of people looking for a suborbital afternoon instead."
2021-05-04 05:29:37,wallstreetbets,"Wtf lol? Are you confusing companies. SKLLZ is a platform to make any game an eSport, that’s it."
2021-05-04 09:00:31,wallstreetbets,You don't understand because you have made no effort to educate yourself.
2021-05-04 10:34:05,wallstreetbets,They are fun games with a high retention rate where the players can win real prizes. Their profit margin is huge they just need to scale up the user base further. Indications are growth/revenue is going to beat estimates so this should be a solid earnings.
2021-05-04 14:50:37,wallstreetbets,North of $24.
2021-05-04 00:22:46,wallstreetbets,"Even if I had 600k, seeing all that red in one day would probably give me an aneurysm."
2021-05-04 08:07:38,wallstreetbets,There is zero logic to this. I bought after it fell last quarter and it's down like 30 bucks a share 😅
2021-05-04 13:10:25,wallstreetbets,Why tho? It's just less featured Power BI. And it cost like $5000 per seat. Not many companies are paying that much especially when you get BI with MS license almost for free.
2021-05-04 00:33:33,wallstreetbets,It's not even good tech tho. This is like Dollar tree tech stocks.
2021-05-04 13:12:30,wallstreetbets,I don't even think they know what those words mean.
2021-05-04 07:15:40,wallstreetbets,I see you everywhere lol
2021-05-04 13:13:53,wallstreetbets,Im been thinking of buying ATVI. Can't escape from CODW videos on YouTube. It's like every one is playing it rn.
2021-05-04 01:17:45,wallstreetbets,I'm also in SKLZ & PLTR. When do you anticipate a bounce?
2021-05-04 02:46:42,wallstreetbets,How’d you get turned into SPLK? Haven’t seen it in anyone else’s portfolio
2021-05-04 01:24:45,wallstreetbets,"Sorry I meant to “play” with, not necessarily lost all of it. When ever I put money into trading, that’s already considered gone, whether win or lose."
2021-05-04 09:20:55,wallstreetbets,Show us the good stuff. Right now you just look like a meme hunting gambling addict
2021-05-04 02:33:15,wallstreetbets,Do you know how to sell covered calls or puts? With a portfolio your size you could be collecting some premium
2021-05-04 10:47:49,wallstreetbets,Ugh it's all red again today too
2021-05-04 10:27:10,wallstreetbets,The “lows” she says 😂😂😂🤣 look Cindy I barley make 20k a year and im just getting into this investing journey seriously since last year and i gotta say my milestone1 goal is half of what your at now (so i can also make brick and mortar investments) so looking at your account all i can do is admire and like you said yk that its only going to come back so in the mean time drink a mimosa and makes some moneys...i lost track of where i was going with this half way through so i gave up
2021-05-04 12:15:50,wallstreetbets,I am looking for a sugar mommy.  Are you available?
2021-05-03 23:45:31,wallstreetbets,Thanks
2021-05-04 01:56:41,wallstreetbets,Still jealous of your balance!
2021-05-04 02:37:45,wallstreetbets,"I'll dip sooner. Some of my stocks on 5x leverage. Why a few percent down risks me hitting hard stop loss my broker forces. 

I'm expecting 100 at least to dip my risk plays, then I'll see. 

 If I had to guess why it's dipping so much it's because Microsoft's PowerPlatform is very good and it's longer term looks like it's got a blue chip challenger. But I don't think it works like that... Companies signed on, got staff trained, it's in the company now for many years."
2021-05-04 17:02:52,wallstreetbets,Earnings are good! Hope your getting saved my dude!
2021-05-04 02:32:59,wallstreetbets,That's cool too ... I'll kick you in vag for 40k
2021-05-04 02:40:18,wallstreetbets,Same roughly.
2021-05-04 02:43:19,wallstreetbets,"I actually think its a bit oversold. But what do I know, I am already down by 10%. I didn’t think it would drop below 170 again."
2021-05-04 05:06:38,wallstreetbets,"Indeed, *I'm something of a master investor myself*"
2021-05-04 10:38:46,wallstreetbets,D
2021-05-04 15:26:04,wallstreetbets,Always performed but decides to shit the bed now
2021-05-04 12:15:12,wallstreetbets,Down $6k in 3 months
2021-05-04 13:31:04,wallstreetbets,"I dont see GME, not impressed."
2021-05-04 10:25:13,wallstreetbets,Hopefully it’ll continue upwards😁
2021-05-04 10:42:38,wallstreetbets,I can't believe I averaged up at one point. Since Aug every time I think it's the bottom it goes lower. Been a frustrating time holding this. They say longer the base the higher it goes. It's been sideways for 2 years so I'm really hopeful it does well in the coming years. I'm definitely going to take profits aggressively once I'm green
2021-05-04 10:47:08,wallstreetbets,It’s hard to see that much disappear and not freak out a little 😂😂
2021-05-04 10:56:56,wallstreetbets,I hope this balance isn’t a result of messing with margin.
2021-05-04 17:54:22,wallstreetbets,As long as someone else is buying LOL
2021-05-04 19:48:30,wallstreetbets,I will make a political statement on it the only surface level but people don’t understand the second level to what happens when you just keep printing money and sending it out into the economy. Referring to the stimulus that’s just create out of nowhere. While we’re already $27 trillion in debt. What’s two more trillion🥴
2021-05-04 19:37:34,wallstreetbets,It’s swings double digits intraday everyday. You don’t need to hold anything else
2021-05-04 02:14:55,wallstreetbets,Wonder who gave me 2 x negative. Gosh...positivity is not a bad thing.
2021-05-03 23:01:43,wallstreetbets,I’m ready for that new administration and red pen to get to work!! Fuck this current bs nonsense. There so so many other opportunities to fix this economy
2021-05-04 11:11:15,wallstreetbets,"Blow into the charging port, the stonks will go straight up"
2021-05-04 10:30:42,wallstreetbets,You shouldn’t hold things with your anus sir
2021-05-04 07:18:48,wallstreetbets,Red is usually associated with fortune in most asian countries.  But im just an ape what do i know.
2021-05-04 19:01:23,wallstreetbets,Because when it's red your alerted to sell and green you buy back in
2021-05-04 06:31:43,wallstreetbets,"That's what they do in China too, because 'red' can't be associated with loss. Yes, they're that petty.  
They do use traffic lights the same way as we do though."
2021-05-04 10:53:13,wallstreetbets,Yes... a nice neutral tone
2021-05-04 08:58:37,wallstreetbets,You literally just made that up.
2021-05-04 19:56:28,wallstreetbets,"Skillz sucks, who tf wants to play those game? Just a common sense perspective made me get out a loss, but I suck so it doesn't matter what I think either🤣"
2021-05-04 00:58:53,wallstreetbets,He is the dip!
2021-05-04 06:07:14,wallstreetbets,Just don’t pick up the phone. Rollsafe.jpg
2021-05-03 23:07:04,wallstreetbets,Just cancel your phone service then they can't call you
2021-05-04 00:37:49,wallstreetbets,You are right. Didn’t consolidate on a cost basis. What brokerage platform is this on?
2021-05-04 10:07:34,wallstreetbets,"For adventure travelers, distance and difficulty is exactly the point. Your suborbital hop will be completely eclipsed by the guy with the SpaceX moon story.

For those less adventurous, who is going to choose to fly in the equivalent of a Cessna when SpaceX offers 747 interior volume in a 90 minute single orbit flight?

If costs are anywhere in the same ballpark, and Musk says they will be, Virgin is dead in the water at that point."
2021-05-04 08:09:55,wallstreetbets,Any shitty flash game an eSport
2021-05-04 13:06:19,wallstreetbets,Their crappy flash games don’t appeal to real gamers. Their web-browser games look like something a boomer would play in retirement. where are their revenues coming from? I’m convinced this company is a scam
2021-05-04 00:25:45,wallstreetbets,Meh in a short period of time my account shot up to 12K and then back down to 6.8K. Lot higher % of my available cash and I didn’t freak out. If I can become numb to it I think a dude with 600K can too.
2021-05-04 08:57:56,wallstreetbets,"Same, I've been in and out for a while now and it used to be like clockwork - $110 runup to earnings at $150, crash back down to $110 and repeat the next quarter. This time it broke $100 and is now stuck in the $80s for months"
2021-05-04 13:31:08,wallstreetbets,"I used it for a couple years. Pretty good for data cleansing and automation. Prior to using it I coded everything in R but I sat in a finance team that hired nimwits that only used excel. It made cross training easier to transition to a product with a GUI. 

Tableau and PowerBI Are both for dashboards rather than cleaning up bad processes. Most companies have pretty bad data discipline which is why a solution like that is useful"
2021-05-04 00:44:01,wallstreetbets,true
2021-05-04 11:50:26,wallstreetbets,"I think Splunk is a decent pick. It's very sticky, is transitioning to a cloud-first subscription model and will soon have reliable constant streams of revenue, and is rated 4 stars by Morningstar. I see it like Adobe back in 2010 when nobody would touch it because of its struggles making the same transition. Whether they can complete this transition successfully is the question, but by the time we have our answer it'll be too late to get in"
2021-05-04 13:29:15,wallstreetbets,"ehh be careful - hype in classic wow might die after tbc release, retail wow is pretty much dead and gone, hearthstone is dead. They definitely don't have much in the pipeline that is wonderful besides CoD and diablo 4 - but diablo 4 isn't some massive microtransaction game that will net them billions of dollars."
2021-05-04 02:50:47,wallstreetbets,"Earnings literally fell off a cliff a couple months back. It didn’t seem to make sense based on the company, earnings and valuation. I bought it and sold for profit a couple times. And this time when I bought, it did not recover. From the outside the company looks good, and the price too low. But it just can’t seem to make its way back up in terms of stock price. Personally I don’t see any major problems with the company, but of course I’m just on the outside. Hopefully you see some good stuff on the inside :)"
2021-05-04 12:40:21,wallstreetbets,might want to find someone in the green
2021-05-04 17:52:48,wallstreetbets,Definitely helped! Price is jumping all over the place. But report shows a strong company.
2021-05-04 15:35:51,wallstreetbets,Yep. Like so so bad.
2021-05-04 16:08:09,wallstreetbets,"Woah, something just happened!! It’s jumping up big"
2021-05-04 10:58:13,wallstreetbets,"Same. But I do like the $120 exit point. That makes sense to me. However it is doubtful I’ll wait and chance it if it pushes above my cost. I’ll probably sell some partials as it moves up.

Stocks that drop rapidly also increase rapidly."
2021-05-04 10:56:33,wallstreetbets,It really is. I ate a lot of ice cream to calm down. Ha ha... now I have to go work that off. I just know the market always bounces back.
2021-05-04 11:00:31,wallstreetbets,No chance. I only lose real money
2021-05-03 23:04:37,wallstreetbets,Sports cards! That’s where I am invested and it’s working out pretty well. Maybe try that?
2021-05-04 11:23:17,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-05-04 07:39:04,wallstreetbets,That might explain the plethora of deadly road accidents based in asia I've seen. Green means go. Red means go faster. Or is that Orks I'm thinking of?
2021-05-04 07:05:35,wallstreetbets,Saying China is petty because their color scheme does not align with yours is exactly what a petty person would say.

2021-05-04 10:05:35,wallstreetbets,We rode that wave for the last year. Was a wild ride

2021-05-04 12:12:00,wallstreetbets,Yeah when this touched $180 I should have taken profits. Got greedy and now I'm red. $120 is a good exit point but I'm going to see how their earnings call goes in the coming days. They seem to be losing market share every quarter

2021-05-04 11:09:20,wallstreetbets,Margin is also real money when the time comes to pay back. May I ask what’s your investing strategy?
2021-05-04 19:47:11,wallstreetbets,I report racism #woke
2021-05-04 10:04:51,wallstreetbets,I see what you did there.
2021-05-04 10:34:03,wallstreetbets,Its what it means in ohio
2021-05-04 07:11:09,wallstreetbets,They are a petty culture though. Red can never be used for something negative there. Most countries don’t operate that way. In fact I can’t think of any other country that’s that strict about color usage.

2021-05-04 05:21:59,wallstreetbets,Beings they really have non existent customer service this means Vlad the Stock Impaler made 330 million for order flow and fucked over the little guy!
2021-05-04 08:11:20,wallstreetbets,"Well, that's their business model. Don't like it, go somewhere else.

This dumb ape's opinion: if you've gone ""rags to riches"" via trading over a ""freemium"" platform, and you can afford a normal brokerage, you're better off paying the marginal yearly fees and actually have more order priority.

I'm sure the same applies if you are using a ""consumer"" brokerage service and then want to play with the ""big dogs"" (professional investors) who operate more in business to business transactions. Totally different rulebook by the IRS and also access to private investments.

There is a reason that office real estate price is higher the closer you get to wall street. Takes an order less time to go 20 feet thru fiber optic than 500 feet thru fiber optic."
2021-05-03 21:52:24,wallstreetbets,Short the hell out of RH!!!
2021-05-04 02:14:33,wallstreetbets,"SO WHAT!  If you’re butt hurt because Rh makes money by providing a FREE investment platform (NOTE! NOT a trading platform) by selling order flow then please explain to me how you expect them to make money.  
Seriously, you guys that are using Rh as a trading platform and then whine about poor fills, order flow, and restricted trading windows need to grow up and move to a real trading platform where you pay for your trades.  When YOU start paying for your trades like the rest of us then you have licenses to whine.  Until then STFU."
2021-05-03 21:32:19,wallstreetbets,And yet they halted GME due to lack of funds...

2021-05-03 23:41:43,wallstreetbets,Most brokers sell order flow.

2021-05-04 15:24:19,wallstreetbets,Its probably been said before but if everyone using RH keeps their account until RH goes public then this is what can happen....Wait until options become available and do long puts ON A DIFFERENT brokerage. Then in mass everyone deletes their account so RH has little-to-no users. I'm no expert autist but this would ruin their business.
2021-05-04 16:02:32,wallstreetbets,"Is that why everytime I go to sell an option the option value IMMEDIATELY drops? It's like they know you are trying to sell and are hoping you will chase it.

2021-05-04 12:09:17,wallstreetbets,Should'a picked another name other than Robinhood. It was kinda bold. People should know that if you aren't paying for the product then you are the product. This should be well known after Cambridge Analytica Scandal years ago.

I don't like them, but I especially don't like the people that didn't research anything about the platform and then complained when it did exactly what it's business model was entitled to do. Money has to be made somewhere, and for Robinhood it was to be made off of the people that didn't care enough to read about their investment platform."

2021-05-04 06:23:55,wallstreetbets,"This is true, the SEC even said so and fined them for it in December 2020

Edit: [https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-321](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-321)

&#x200B;

""As the SEC’s order finds, one of Robinhood’s selling points to customers  was that trading was “commission free,” but due in large part to its  unusually high payment for order flow rates, Robinhood customers’ orders  were executed at prices that were inferior to other brokers’ prices.   Despite this, according to the SEC’s order, Robinhood falsely claimed in  a website FAQ between October 2018 and June 2019 that its execution  quality matched or beat that of its competitors.  The order finds that  Robinhood provided inferior trade prices that in aggregate deprived  customers of $34.1 million even after taking into account the savings  from not paying a commission. """
2021-05-04 09:08:06,wallstreetbets,"Their execution quality is poor. That’s why they’ve been fined for it, in fact. 

I’d rather pay a commission than trade with RobinHood but that’s just me."

2021-05-04 12:17:00,wallstreetbets,I know this isn't the WSB style ... but you can beat Robinhood at their game by merely sticking to buy and hold. If you buy and hold for 1 year ... their revenue for the year only has 1 trade they can front run.
2021-05-04 10:37:11,wallstreetbets,Pretty hypocritical for wsb to shit all over RH when they were pushing it hard on the 4 million new subscribers that joined when GME was blowing up.

2021-05-04 10:28:39,wallstreetbets,"Fractional shares aren't real shares, just an agreement with your broker. They cannot currently be transferred between firms."
2021-05-04 16:54:51,wallstreetbets,"I don't think you can. Remember that owning a fraction of a share is practically impossible. What is happening in the event of a fractional share is that the medium (in this case, likely RH) buys a share themselves, and gives you a dividend directly when you decide to sell the fraction.

As a result, transferring fractions is not gonna happen. It's best instead, I'm guessing, to liquidate fractions. If you really want that fraction transferred, you'll probably have to do it manually."
2021-05-04 16:45:49,wallstreetbets,"It's fractional shares bud, if you're broker's having trouble just fucking sell them and cash out lol. Your 0.37 AMC share isn't going to make or break you."

You, as a trader, want the smallest bid/ask spread possible. Market makers want the BIGGEST spread possible (this is one way they make money). Now, RH, your broker, also wants the BIGGEST spread possible.

2021-05-04 15:46:45,wallstreetbets,"This intuitively makes sense for a larger account, but not smaller.

If standard commission to place a trade is $5 and I'm instead buying $250 of stock on RH, I'm gonna notice if it fills at $255.  So the PFOF price fucking has to be pretty small.  [WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-free-trading-on-robinhood-isnt-really-free-1541772001) gave an example of $5 for a $20k trade.

If I find the time and energy, maybe I'll look into the SEC report and see what the % findings are.  But I believe RH is much, much cheaper for accounts under ~$50-100K.

(You can of course make the argument that people trade more frequently and lose gains on RH because of this - it's a totally fair one, but more behavioral and individual than it is about RH's PFOF)"
2021-05-04 07:25:11,wallstreetbets,"Yet many people still think it's not the case. See /u/Mongoose_Western's comment for an example of how convinced people are that ""free"" trading is cheaper."

2021-05-04 05:39:06,wallstreetbets,"Because it’s not proven. It’s just a jackass making shit up

Before RH made zero commissions standard, other brokerages charged commission AND received payment for order flow. The high dollar amount is because so many people trade so frequently on there. That wouldn’t be possible if everyone was paying $5 per trade on top of payment for order flow

You can hate RH for plenty of reasons but this isn’t one of them"

How would they hedge your trades? You think they’re selling you the calls themselves? Or shorting the positions you buy? Or buying puts on what you’re trading?

That’s so asinine I can’t believe I’m responding to this 

Casinos don’t make money by being on the opposite end of every bet. That would be the quickest way to fold. They make money by getting a tiny piece of the action. RH does that through payment for order flow. 

If you’re making $50-100k and up trades, the small price improvement some can offer might make them better. But for the majority of people flipping meme stocks or momentum plays in relatively small accounts, you’re saving money with this business model versus paying $5 per trade. And if you’re trading more like an institution where the price improvement matters more than the commission per trade, you’re a fucktard for trading like that on RH to begin with

RH is basically a casino that operates with an expense ratio lower for the vast majority of customers than they were previously paying and now they’ve forced the rest of the industry to follow suit"

2021-05-04 07:35:08,wallstreetbets,"That’s a good question. They’re all required by regulation to execute the best price available. But they don’t all use the same amount of vendors. Companies like Schwab use more and that’s how they can get more price improvements. It’s generally pretty negligible for retail customers, but it is true some of the bigger traditional brokerages get more price improvements

I’m not sure what you mean by free brokerages versus paid though. RH going to zero commish has forced the rest to be commission free too. 

Truth is, if you’re paying commissions for your trades still, you’re at the wrong place. I’d imagine Morgan or Goldman or some of the big sleezeballs charge fees, but there’s no way their customer’s execution or trading platforms are better than Schwab/Fidelity/TD. That’s not their business model to optimally support retail traders.

> The SEC said that Robinhood benefited from completing trades at prices that were less than optimal for its clients. In aggregate, those fees deprived customers of $34.1 million, even after taking into account the savings from the commission-free trades.

2021-05-04 08:01:46,wallstreetbets,"Your rebuttal doesn't really address his argument though.  He said outright that Robinhood wasn't completing trades at the absolute optimal price for it's clients, but that the difference was still in the client's favor over the $5 per transaction model.  The fact that the SEC confirmed this still doesn't refute what he's saying.

If you're trading on a small account, losing extra pennies per share in the spread is still significantly cheaper than paying directly per transaction.  Period.  It's shady on RH's part, but ultimately you aren't getting hurt over the alternative until you're in a much larger account size."
2021-05-04 10:28:11,wallstreetbets,"Isn't that the whole problem with PFOF? The average customer doesn't understand it, which allows companies like Robinhood to charge the customer more while they believe they're paying less."

2021-05-04 09:09:29,wallstreetbets,haha all good fam
2021-05-04 12:18:59,wallstreetbets,I work in the industry. I know far more about routing regulations than you do. You don’t want to believe me. Oh well enjoy getting ripped off by robinhood.
2021-05-04 08:25:16,wallstreetbets,"True, but that entire premise doesn't make any sense. None of Robinhood's competitors charge $5 commission per transaction, so it's a ridiculous comparison. Sure Robinhood's payment for order flow doesn't cost you more than $5 per transaction, but then neither do the other brokerages.

And even if they did, it would be $5 flat, not per share. So you're right that on a small account it would be significant, but on an order of $10,000 that's only 0,05%, which is much less than what Robinhood costs you through payment for order flow.

At the end of the day, the only thing that matters is which broker allows you to buy a stock at a lower price on average, and that is not Robinhood as was proven by the SEC's investigation."
2021-05-04 10:45:47,wallstreetbets,"PFOF is literally only beneficial for customers.

Stocks and options are like used cars. Sometimes real customers trade it them in, and sometimes spivs (hedgefunds) will try to sell you a lemon.

If you're a car dealership (market maker) would you make a more agressive bid to the benign customer or known spiv? The customer, of course. So you'll also make a more agressive bid to a known customer (PFOF) vs unknown entity.

Furthermore all pfof orders are exposed as auctions on an exchange anyway, so if someone in the market wants to price improve they can."
2021-05-04 17:11:34,wallstreetbets,"It's not your job to shit talk on the internet,  yet you still do."
2021-05-04 15:22:26,wallstreetbets,The fact that you think I was arguing IN SUPPORT of Robinhood proves how you didn't try to understand me at all. Quite hilarious to be honest...
2021-05-04 08:58:21,wallstreetbets,"None of Robinhood's competitors do *anymore*.  Who was the first?  That's right, Robinhood was.  They shook up the whole market and forced their competitors to react or fade out for retail investors.  Look back and when all the ""free"" brokers became free and it was after Robinhood created that dynamic.

This sounds like I'm defending RH, I'm not, I transferred all my shit out because I don't trust them and because my account has grown past where I'm comfortable there.  But I don't have a problem with PFOF for small investors.  Small investment accounts come out so far ahead it's ludicrous over the former model.  My mom, for example, LOVES her Robinhood account.  She has 1 share or fractions of several companies she really likes using: AirBNB, Costco, etc, and if she paid $5 per transaction it would be a complete nonstarter for her.  Buying 1 share and then selling it a few months later would cost you $10, that's a HUGE amount of money for such small scale transactions.  


A good argument could be made that there isn't any reason to be using Robinhood *now,* but they revolutionized investing for small money."
2021-05-04 11:14:00,wallstreetbets,"That's not true at all, it's quite the opposite. PFOF is literally only NOT beneficial to the customers. Brokers still make the same commission by selling the order flow while appealing to a larger audience, and hedge funds make more money by selling customers stocks at a higher price.

> Furthermore all pfof orders are exposed as auctions on an exchange anyway, so if someone in the market wants to price improve they can.

That's not how PFOF works. The idea behind it is that hedge funds receive the order flow before the market does and are able to front run the market that way."
2021-05-04 17:22:59,wallstreetbets,That's because that one is actually fun for me and doesn't cost me anything. Looking out for yourself is your job. Why can't you do that? I'm not a babysitter. I'm not your dad who clearly failed you.
2021-05-04 09:08:56,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, with that I definitely agree. We have Robinhood to thank for lower transaction fees and getting to the point we are now, where the rest had to follow suit and lower fees to remain competitive. But now that we're there, they're just a more expensive alternative that misleads customers into thinking they're cheaper."
2021-05-04 11:51:34,wallstreetbets,"But thats not true... PFOF orders literally get better execution than non PFOF orders. I explained why from first principles and furthermore the data supports this.

Also, you really dunno how auction mechanisms work. There is no ""front-running."" ALL ORDERS ARE EXPOSED TO THE MARKET. Please read some specs before reposting some garbage you don't fully understand."

* Market sell off and Tesla goes with it.
* Promising news from several competitors.
* More bad news like the production delay we just saw.
* Elons BC gamble goes south, making investors realize how reckless he actually is.  They would have lost money last quarter is it werent for BC.

I am 100% convinced TSLA is way over priced and many market particpants even know this.  Tricky thing is timing but these puts are at the very slowest decay time on the curve.  I feel like worst case I break even or TSLA is flatish and I exit small loss."

[ On the website, Clover says its currently in 8 states, However, it is actually in 10 states however they haven't released that info yet. Just looking at the growth chart that YOY growth is huge, 2021 I expect will be huge especially if the Medicare age is lowered. ](https://preview.redd.it/jq5j24xe50x61.png?width=1293&format=png&auto=webp&s=82ddbc4ed0d0e6a16074747a2f82a98a28222622)

[ We can also see here, Clover is the fastest-growing medicare company in 2020, simply look at the chart yourself. This rapid growth only accelerates Clovers fuel. ](https://preview.redd.it/cbm19gof50x61.png?width=911&format=png&auto=webp&s=91f623b391031634a4d4f34e84ae39106d516737)

[ Clover is backed by one of the largest companies in the world, Alphabet or Google.   Something that should be pointed out is that Google's partnering with CLOV could be massive. MSFT is investing heavily in healthcare technology. Both company's market cap is 1T+ \(credit to u\/sugardaddy for telling me this\)](https://preview.redd.it/t41zlb3k50x61.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=9f4ce646c7f99e99d6e2459059aa0688e922057c)

[ Clover is an innovative disrupting company, its mission is to lower the cost of Medicare plans, Clover sees that the healthcare system is broken as healthcare is expensive. What does Cathie Woods love? Disrupting innovation! I think if Cathie saw this stock she'd definitely buy in! ](https://preview.redd.it/vfoqs0rl50x61.png?width=788&format=png&auto=webp&s=6d99f6a09ffd517206fd4233c26dc4c1617c3d47)

[ Clovers growth has been growing rapidly, I do believe 2021 will be a fantastic year for Clover, and maybe report its first profitable quarter.](https://preview.redd.it/fiinjtmn50x61.png?width=1149&format=png&auto=webp&s=2768290fc6df4867fe0d723ca88d3847407d1c5d)

[ This photo shows how the Clover Assistant works, basically, an app that can help you make decisions quick \(here's an example\)](https://preview.redd.it/humhrjmp50x61.png?width=1568&format=png&auto=webp&s=45eb4f36de7f6ab9a88a0c554d3c6f9d64fc463c)

**Comparing Clover to Teladoc**

[ Teladoc currently has a 25 billion market cap with a 10&#37; short float. ](https://preview.redd.it/asptmh9060x61.png?width=693&format=png&auto=webp&s=697a12de87dafddde75b9f5e81007f730329e4b2)

[ Clover has a 3.77 billion market cap, with a 30-40&#37; short interest. Teladoc is nearly 6.6x bigger than Clover, if Clover is even half of Teladoc's market cap, it'd be trading around 4x higher.](https://preview.redd.it/qtpq5cj160x61.png?width=722&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e4fb6fd2f277003b6af3428198d0ead0a060086)

[ Looking at the call options, on the 5\/21 expiration, there are a LOT of OI calls for Clover. This makes a Gamma squeeze possible](https://preview.redd.it/8pe4fkf260x61.png?width=1164&format=png&auto=webp&s=0917209919a165bfd026a4835bbb92018309671e)

There is still a lot to be covered, this is only a small part.

TL;DR: Short + Gamma squeeze possible good company backed by Google fastest medicare growth company + possible medicare age lowered which could give potentially millions of more customers for Clover.

My positions:

So with the recent fears and gossip about correction coming in next two months ., and the tax hike in play.. lots of money will rotate into dividend plays .. Snd out of high risk. How’s it go ? Ahh yes buy the hype ... but hmm ER seems like news ?! 

Next point is the recent public smear campaign of chamath and its resulting bad vibes associated with all his darlings. May still be a bad taste in peoples mouths ., and with Eli Lilly reporting this week a nice dividend play. Undervalued already before ER... 

And lastly and probably the most probable of all: what if there ER is not a blowout. I mean lots of great numbers this quarter .. lots of really good beats . But no matching price action.. kind of seems like value was baked in already on a majority of stocks. 
Healthcare is a tough biz, and is all about the big players revolving doors and govt money. States and federal govt used United healthcare for Medicare/caid."

2021-05-03 22:04:41,wallstreetbets,"lolololol, you pulled this shit out of their gimmicky slide deck. the fastest growing insurer ""22%"". All of 60k pts in 5 years. Look ma, I added 1 dollar to my 1 dollar account. My YoY growth is 100%. More than Warren Buffet!!!

We've got 60000 pts in 10 states. So 6000 per state? My church has more seniors. My high school might too. 

But ... 400m revenue and huge revenue growth YoY?!?! Any basic accounting course woulda taught you not to conveniently forget about expenses. Their medical care reimburse cost is only 103% of revenue. Not to mention debt and payroll expenses. Rofls, they burn 200m a year, with 4B valution to obtain 60,000 patients that they then can't turn a profit on. That's 66k per patient that costs them money to insure. Better yet, buy Nikola. At least that company knows how to sell a $60,000 turd.

But the app will save lives and reduce costs!?! So much cost savings after 60,000 patients and 5 years, that we're still paying 100%+ for their medical care. Hundreds of thousands of medical studies and big data research being done by braniacs in all fields of medicine, science, acturial giants, and these fools think they're gonna solve ""healthcare"" with an ""app"" that asks doctors to answer multiple choice questions on what symptoms the patient has.

2021-05-04 00:36:43,wallstreetbets,"The short percentage is pretty out of date now. It's probably only 20-25%, which is still crazy high. 

Short percentage doesn't impact gamma squeeze though. Open interest (which is crazy high) and delta (which is somewhat low) do. High OI and low delta increases the likelihood of a gamma squeeze if there is significant price movement, as in a good news release or earnings report."
2021-05-04 07:37:49,wallstreetbets,"Gamma squeeze has 0 to do with short interest, GME has rotted the minds of WSB Apes."
2021-05-04 03:38:27,wallstreetbets,"Yeah all of a sudden everything is now the ""next GME"". 

Without even realizing how rare the situation that GME is in right now lol. 

Not everything is about a short squeeze. Maybe you should do a little DD yourself instead of repeating the same garbage we see every day on almost every stock."

2021-05-04 02:07:03,wallstreetbets,You need to buy shares lol. OTM calls don’t move share price
2021-05-04 17:12:10,wallstreetbets,This is such a mistake. Viacom will do you much better.
2021-05-04 17:04:57,wallstreetbets,"Calls are options, a derivative of the stock.  Its a contract where the buyer of the call is buying the right to purchase the stock at the strike price by the date of the contract.  So if a call is listed at .60 5/21 $12 you are paying $0.60/share (calls are contracts of 100 shares, so it would cost $60) for the right to buy the shares for $12 by 5/21.  On 5/22, if the price of the stock isn't at least $12.01, the contract expires worthless.  Also consider that you paid a premium of $0.60/share, so your breakeven wouldn't be until it's above $12.60/share.

If the stock went to $13/share, you'd be getting a discount of $0.40/share and could immediately sell the shares for $40 profit.  Most people that are interested in the quick money like that won't even buy the shares, they'll sell their contract as it would then be worth like $2.00/share if it goes well above the strike price before expiration.  Then you're looking at a profit of $140 for example.

I think only like 8% of contracts are actually exercised.  23% expire worthless and 69% are sold/closed before expiration.

&#x200B;

If you already own shares of CLOV (at least 100) you could write a contract that would obligate you to sell your shares if the contract went into the money.  The reason most people do this is because they don't think it will actually hit that price within that timeframe and they pocket the premium up front.  So the writer of our call from the above example gets $0.60/share up front = $60.  If the contract expires worthless, they keep the whole $60.  Most people will buy to close the contract as it gets close to $0, so maybe they buy to close for $10 and pocket $50.

If the contract does go into the money and they don't close out, they keep the profit on the shares, up to the contract price, plus the premium they received for the contract.  So again, using our above example, if the stock was at $10 when they wrote the $12 call, but it goes up to $13, they sell 100 shares at $12 each, plus the $0.60 in premium, so $2.60 profit per share ($260 total profit).  They miss out on that extra $0.40, but hey, profit is profit.

EDIT: Also, if you're able to sell multiple contracts over a few weeks or months, you're indirectly bringing down your cost basis.  So if you pocketed like $0.60/share 4 times and you had bought in at $12.00, you're really at like $10.60/share without having bought more shares to average down.  Then you can sell for profit at like $11, even though you bought in at $12.

2021-05-03 23:15:51,wallstreetbets,Was GME A GAMMA 🤔
2021-05-04 02:09:41,wallstreetbets,Not necessarily. It’s about 40% if you don’t deduct the shares that can’t be traded until restrictions expire which is huge. Meaning the shorts could get margin called and have to close positions. There is a new short report on the 11th or 12th.
2021-05-04 05:01:32,wallstreetbets,Bought in yesterday. Lost over a dollar a share. that's smart money right there. Ran right away from me to a smarter someone elses portfolio.

2021-05-03 23:02:47,wallstreetbets,"oh yeah, the confirmation bias runs strong in this subreddit and the clov cult in gneral. it's just fun to shit on their parade.

in the world of moonshot spacs, I actually think OPEN had a shot. Their concept is pretty simple - buy houses fast via the web and flip em. clear business model, clear profit model. platform that actually works.

in terms of other weird meme-ish shit, I'm interested in seeing how BB will do. the people who keep saying they have $3B worth in patents are nuts. Some of their cell phone tech is from a decade ago. It's not worth shit anymore. That said, they do have a nice enterprise tech for cars. Maybe it'll be a big market player. They need to reinvent themselves. At their current valuation and share price, it's might be worth checking out. And they're liquid enough to wheel options on if you caught bag holding.

In terms of healthcare/pharma:

I'm interested in Kempharm: approved ADHD drug, reaching early sales/licensing milestones. Upside if the drug takes off. It's nothing revolutionary, but its a pro-drug platform that delivers longer lasting active metabolite. Smoother curve, maybe less addictive.

EOL - approved for competition to botox. Overcame a major import/trade dispute allowing them to start sales in the US. Just recently diluted shares majorly at 9.50, so I expect price will hang around there until a quarter or two of earnings, etc. Might be a good time to enter though.

SIEN - they make breast implants. They're decently cheap right now simply because COVID shutdowns and a number of pre-covid issues really hamstrunged them. Price is low enough to consider entering and seeing how it cosmetic and reconstructive breast surgery will recover.

ENDP - they have a decent pharmaceutical compounding business, a number of fun random proprietary drugs for stuff like dupuytrens and cellulite. However they also selling narcs and are getting sued. that's their major headwind and their stock has gotten pounded by it. It's at 5-6 dollars. I'm in simply on the bet that they will settle their liabilities, survive/get acquired/sell off assets, and price will gain at some point.

None of these companies is perfect, but they have a reasonable valuation and business models that can actually achieve profit. I'll take my chances with them, if I'm going to be doing a wallstreet bet.

I should note, im not afraid to short the shit out of crappy stocks, so clov and maybe even some
of these if they dont shape up 🤣"

**Background on the Sector**

There are three topics everyone who wants to understand the Psychedelic Sector needs to know up front:

**1) Intent:** This sector is fundamentally different from the Cannabis Sector in a large way. The target market is primarily medicinal uses rather than recreational uses. Cannabis has a large recreational movement, where psychedelics have a small one. While this may deter some folks, I find it reassuring: to play in this space a company must be serious and committed.

**2) Diversity:** There are a number of drugs in the psychedelic space - psilocybin (mushrooms), LSD (acid), MDMA (ecstasy), ketamine (anesthetic), to name a few. Each is in some stage of clinical trials, and each company is attempting to use different ones to treat different mental and behavioral health conditions. These conditions are diverse as well, though the largest target markets include ADHD, anxiety, depression, PTSD, and drug and alcohol addiction.

**3) Delivery:** Psychedelic research today is not seeking to put high volumes of over-the-counter mushrooms or LSD pills in your local CVS. Psychedelics are being researched in controlled microdoses, and the intended delivery is by trained therapists through guided psychotherapy sessions. Psychedelics on their own may give your mind a period of disconnection and subdued feelings of fear, but with proper guidance from a trained therapist this period also becomes an opportunity for ""rewiring"" old mental blocks that lead to mental illness. Some people begin to break through chronic mental health barriers in just a few appointments. CNN recently covered the sector in an hour long special under Lisa Ling's ""This is Life"" series called ""Psychedelic Healing"" (Season 7, Episode 6). This demonstrates the delivery method well, as well as several early success stories.

**MindMed DD --> Kevin O'Leary, Bruce Linton and the Najarian Brothers are in this**

[Left: Bruce Linton \(Founder & Ex-CEO of $CGC\) Right: Kevin O'Leary \(Shark Tank\) are big investors\/backers of MindMed](https://preview.redd.it/7rnqywrno0x61.png?width=1275&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f8a41c0038250d725417596045d44295d6016ac)

Though my summary is below, don’t just take my word for it! MindMed has an incredibly well organized [website](https://mindmed.co/) where you can see much of this for yourself.

*As an investor in a sector with a diversity of molecules and a diversity of applications*, you want a company that has a diverse approach. **That’s MindMed** \- which is in Phase 1 or Phase 2 trials with each 18-MC, LSD, MDMA, DMT, and psilocybin tackling a variety of conditions, including anxiety, opioid withdrawal, ADHD, and cluster headaches, to name a few. This diversity give MindMed a high chance of having not just one, but several breakthrough molecules. Kevin O’Leary (yes, Shark Tank’s Mr. Wonderful) is perhaps the most well-known investor in MindMed.

*As an investor in a sector that requires integration with therapists*, including new tools and training, you want a company that is developing more than just the necessary drugs. **MindMed is the whole package.** MindMed has paired with NYU to develop therapist training strategies and has announced its launch of Albert, a digital medicine division meant to tie it all together. MindMed's recent announcements have indicated they are actively hiring to give this division more depth and to potentially undertake an acquisition in the digital platform space. MindMed is already thinking about **how** we make this work. In the future, a therapist will have use this digital tool to keep a list of psychedelic options catered to a host of mental conditions, and each will be tied to delivery strategies and training. MindMed's wholistic view from clinical trials through implementation is what sets them apart from others in the sector.

*As an investor in a sector that is ""breakthrough"" in nature*, you want a company that has the right leadership. In January, Robert Barrow entered the MindMed team as the Chief Development Officer. Robert brings extensive knowledge of psilocybin research, but more importantly he was part of securing the Breakthrough Therapy Designation with the FDA for his prior psilocybin program (Phase 2 Clinical Trials) at the Usona Institute. MindMed hopes to secure similar breakthrough designations for their trials and fast-track them. **Bruce Linton**, former Canopy Growth (CGC) Chairman and CEO, sits on MindMed's Board of Directors. Dr. Halperin Wernli and Carol Nast, President and COO respectively, each help round out the management team with over 50 combined years of leadership in drug and product development in emerging markets and heavily regulated environments.

Finally, I know every investor wants to know how much the stock price will move over time, so here are a few catalysts to think on:

[FDA \\""Breakthrough\\"" designation coming?](https://preview.redd.it/5llgt3osv0x61.png?width=564&format=png&auto=webp&s=c428b419525972f2570d9cdbf6462a8b15ac4dee)

**Next catalysts:** This is more obvious, but of course any trial milestones are catalysts! I’m particularly excited about August/September this year when we expect Phase 2b trial results to begin rolling in, though Phase 1 announcements will continue to occur as the portfolio grows as well. With any luck, breakthrough designations will accelerate trials and portfolio growth further."

It truly makes you confront your psyche, past trauma, and unresolved emotions. Unlike traditional antidepressants or anxiolytics which just dull.

2021-05-03 20:59:56,wallstreetbets,This is a no-brainer. The long-term potential is huge. The apes need some options to play with in the meantime though.

2021-05-04 00:51:28,wallstreetbets,"Can you help me how they will make money when the black market grows this stuff by pounds in a very cheap way.  I had a string of bad investments in bio but really want to invest in this field.  I just can picture how they make money when the underlying product is produced so cheaply.

This is one of the reasons why cannabis sector is struggling because the black market is doing it way better and cheaper.  I can see this being cannabis sector 2.0 but worse because penetration rate will be much lower and the total market is much smaller than cannabis.  

If someone have insight please let me know because I believe in the product and use it myself once in a while in a therapy.  Help.  The 2 billion dollar market cap for MMED seems pretty frothy knowing even if they succeed in clinical phases, the products hitting the market is years away.

Have I seen its value swing down 50k from its high yes. I'd rather let this company do its thing rather than try to time things. 1 year in and there hasn't been a single bad thing that's come out of the company. Actually it's all been great news. 

Yes the price is volatile but thats showbiz baby. The potential gains by holding are astronomical and I would be kicking myself for selling out. I'd rather see that 20k burn to 0 than get out before REAL catalysts for short term profit. 

The money right now isn't life changing and nor do I need it right now. Thats called proper risk tolerance and analysis. But if they even hit on 1 FDA approval, then the money starts to become life changing. They get several approvals and breakthrough status...I'm probably considering retiring before 40.

2021-05-03 22:10:07,wallstreetbets,Phase 3 trials seems like a challenge. They need to prove high levels of clinical efficacy. I don’t know if that’s possible.
2021-05-03 23:33:08,wallstreetbets,Anything under 4.40 is a discount imo
2021-05-04 03:48:34,wallstreetbets,Everyone was so convinced this was going to explode and it plummeted. Now everyone is saying it’s a “long term” hold. Lemmie know when it goes up a dollar

2021-05-04 07:23:53,wallstreetbets,"I got burned here too, but the red flags are obvious.  They don’t hold patents that are worth anything, they haven’t run multicenter trials in the US, they don’t have anybody working for them.  It’s a big concept and decent website, but it’s not worth anything in its current state.

With a small marketing budget, you could create a viable competitor for this company very quickly."
2021-05-03 21:05:27,wallstreetbets,This aged well
2021-05-04 12:35:35,wallstreetbets,"The one problem I have is that these trials aren't tied to a specific date, so you could be sitting there for months or even years just watching your stock price slowly drift lower as the company burns through cash. Then its still unsure whether the results will be good or bad. They do have a variety of approaches, but I have smaller companies I would rather play through, given MNMD's billion dollar valuation.

I'll pass on this boat."

2021-05-04 10:16:32,wallstreetbets,"Ya I agree - this is a long term hold. Will be interesting to see what this industry looks like in 2031. Will it be fully accepted or will there be pushback (possibly from pharmaceutical companies not wanting alternatives).

Also when I mentioned to my parents about this company, they kind of rolled their eyes as if they were saying ""really...give people shrooms"", even tho 1/2 (or was it 1/3) Canadians have been prescribed opioids this year.

But that hesitation from that generation may suggest that MMED will remain undervalued as there are lots of skeptics.

The harm they can do when you are properly prepared and properly dosing is basically zero (as long as you don't have some rare condition)

First test it before you ingest it. Then google the recommendet dose and stick to that. If you are fancy, google good supplements (psychedSubstance has a good video on that) and get those. Prepare shade and water with electrolytes (against over-hydration) before the trip.
Lastly: 3 months break minimum between each trip.

But at the end of the day this is another bio pharma company without a product coming to market (at least anytime soon). This stonk might p&d a lot, people can make money if they time it right, but at the end of the day it could be years before this venture brings anything to market, and there will be no long term growth until there is an actual product in the pipeline. I see no catalyst in the immediate future (next year or three anyway) that would make this stock move beyond its meme potential. And I don’t hear anyone talking about overcoming the current federal prohibition of many of these chemicals. It’s great they’re finally allowing this kind of research to take place, but research is a whole lot different than tangible products. It’s a long uphill fight against decades of misinformation and FUD relating to the product itself. Can anyone tell me if they have plans to lobby to move some of these chemicals out of schedule 1? They can’t even get thc out of its schedule 1 jail, which is now backed by big money. 

Always calls on LSD, it’s the best. But I really don’t see the play here unless you’re prepared to hold for years."

2021-05-04 12:09:49,wallstreetbets,"Okay interesting, and I'm certainly just speaking from my experience/bias and not as an expert or anything.  


In Canada, the grey/black market is still largely superior and all of the public companies are bleeding money (I used to work in the industry, it was very misguided and lots of people just trying to raise capital).   


I can already buy shrooms and shroom products (microdose capsules, different formulas) reliably online. So I just don't see a path to profitability for a public company with overhead selling shrooms. No idea how those patents will play out either... for example, I cannot get many of my favourite cannabis strains on the legal market, because producers want to grow and patent their own genetics. **But no one asked for that**. As someone who believes in shrooms, I do not see investing in a large company like this as being profitable. Also, there is certainly something.. off-putting.. about these companies trying to capitalize on psychedelic healing... makes me wonder how many of these executives even understand psychedelics (but I recognize I'm in the wrong sub for these statements LOL)"
2021-05-04 08:44:32,wallstreetbets,I figured as much. That’s why I’m hesitant to buy. I’m all in on draft kings at the moment.
2021-05-03 22:44:54,wallstreetbets,What other issues? I like the company but would love another opinion on it
2021-05-03 22:45:46,wallstreetbets,Care to elaborate?
2021-05-03 22:36:51,wallstreetbets,possible because they are on shrooms.

2021-05-03 21:53:06,wallstreetbets,"Are you being serious?! My cost basis in that stock is $5/sh you just gotta hold it for more than 5 mins if you plan on making any money. Would you dig up a seed you just planted multiple times a day to see if it’s grown yet?

E b a n g earnings were Friday and every stock has been falling on earnings lately regardless of what they are so that’s nothing new. It’s at an all time low because it’s only been listed on the NASDAQ since the end of June last year and there was that big Hindenburg Research short sellers report on it recently as well. 

It has not stayed around $4 basically year round, it was over $8 on three different occasions just in 2021 so far! That is 3 chances for a 2x return or more in just 4 months. I like the stock and I can see it easily being in the $20+ range by the end of the year. 

You must have consolidation before growth. Idk when you bought in but if it was after the end of March then you missed the boat. I am expecting a gap fill in the short term to $6.22 from when it gapped down on 4/26."
2021-05-03 22:28:53,wallstreetbets,"I'm averaged in at 4 dollars. I'm just impatient. I'm not saying I'm losing money on the stocks I'm picking. Just that I put money into a stock and it drops immediately to all time lows. I'm not ""losing"" money because I'm not selling at a loss. It's just pissing me off.

2021-05-04 18:05:05,wallstreetbets,Ebang's website looks like an abandoned group project half-completed by a special education class trying to learn Wix. Greater than 50% chance the whole thing is a not-so-elaborate fraud.
2021-05-03 22:38:56,wallstreetbets,"Ah I gotcha. As long as you aren’t realizing the losses you’re obviously good, but gotta keep that in mind with profits too. I was up big on AMC at $14/sh and I let it all slip away and now I’m back to red. 

I do think it will recover but I could have hopped out for a great profit and gotten back in lower than I was before, and I’d be sitting good rn. But hindsight will always be 20/20 and you can’t beat yourself up over stuff like that. Technicals can only take you so far and they will always be trumped by news/earnings. 

Better to invest in the sleepers before they run than to try to catch the runners on the way up imo. My tip - look out for ticker “e e i q” - only has 8 mil trade-able shares and under 2 mil of that is float. It trades like a penny and any volume at all soars the price. It is just waiting for a news catalyst and I will be getting as much as I can until then - I think it’s an easy 10 bagger at this price."

2021-05-04 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$OPEN is GROSSLY undervalued and will blow up soon (DD)  

**$OPEN will be massive and will make apes millionaires in the long run, here is why:**

Real estate is a 2.5 trillion dollar industry and one of the few industries that has not been (yet) disrupted. If you have ever purchased a home you know **how fucking awful the process of buying real estate is.** Going to open houses, Your agent Tracy can’t find anything you like because she got her real estate license only because she is hot . Putting an offer on a house just to get overbid by Keith from California offering 100k over the asking price.

Opendoors ($OPEN) is disrupting this industry and attempting to cut the middle man, the real estate agent, and implementing the iBuyer model where you sell the house directly to them, for cash that is available in 48 hours. Fucking insane.

Now, how effective is this model? Well, in 2020 they generated 2.6 BILLION in revenue, in the middle of a fucking pandemic. Which was 45% less than 2019 when they made “Only” $4.7 Billion. [Here is the 2020 report](https://notorious-rob.com/2021/03/vip-opendoor-technologies-q4-and-full-year-2020-results-guess-whos-back/) They sold about 3,000 homes in 2017. Before Covid-19 hit, Opendoor sold just shy of 19,000 homes in 2019. That is over 6X growth in just two years.

&#x200B;

[That’s enormous growth.](https://preview.redd.it/r2ftcz7tbzw61.jpg?width=943&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=914753ab2d5075b8ff669a693bd188986e205a99)

&#x200B;

Every Industry that has a middleman agent has been disrupted, cutting the agent out of the picture. Internet sales is and it will continue to erase the typical salesman to reduce the margin. This provides convenience for the buyer and more profits for the company. Almost every industry that used to rely upon high-pressure salesman has been disrupted by technology. Replacing all the bottle service girls who got their real estate license and have a profile picture with crossed arms selling real estate will not be hard to replace.

Replaced the past years:

~~Travel Agents:~~ Internet

~~Insurance Agents:~~ Internet

~~Stock Broker Agents:~~ Internet

~~Car Salesman:~~ Internet

~~Taxis:~~ Internet

~~Me~~: My wife boyfriend

Why I Like the stock:

**The business model is the future**

Realtors are riped to go extinct like every other middleman agent. When was the last time you called a stockbroker to buy a stock? When was the last time to sit down with a travel agent to buy plane tickets? Or with an Insurance agent to buy insurance for your Volkswagen Jetta 2011? Buying real online is inevitable.

**Strong Revenues even during a pandemic:**

This is not a startup with products that don’t exist, they are not rolling down a truck like Nikola. They have 2.6 Billion dollars in revenue in a bad year.

**Overly Shorted Stock:**

Shorties lack wrinkles in their brain and decided to short this stock because they don't like Chamath, After the pandemic, a lot of whales took big positions against the real estate market and shorted growth stocks like Rocket, and Opendoors. You know what happens when these bets turns against them.

Yeah buying a home online sounds great but just like a car you better go through a professional to make sure everything checks out. A great realtor can make a significant difference in your buying and selling of a home. Buying homes online sound great but it can also backfire tremendously and they are acting as your agent. You should expect to get less for selling on Opendoor  because they are trying to get your home at a discount to increase their profits. If this is a play it is a long one I don't see this as something that will ""blow up soon"" without a real serious catalyst."
2021-05-03 23:04:23,wallstreetbets,"These online realtor companies are horrible. Lots of
Stories of Homie and Open selling houses for below market value. In a sellers market like this it’s a no brainer to sell your house through an agent, pay your 3-6% fee and pocket the 10s of thousands of dollars Keith paid over asking. 
Maybe after the crash companies like this will have more success. The Realtor associations have hundreds of thousands of agents marketing against companies like this and they make billions more in rev to do it. I wouldn’t expect big returns anytime soon."
2021-05-04 01:29:02,wallstreetbets,Redfin has a market cap of $7.2B and they’re actually profitable. Also not being brought down by SPAC hate

Everyone uses Zillow/refin, what makes u think “open” is gonna generate enough users to beat Zillow?

I believe Zillow has more exposure, more users, more cash, and honestly I find it hard to believe realtors are going to be replaced...

2021-05-03 22:19:03,wallstreetbets,The reason investors do so poorly with actively managed funds is that they chase gains when the manager is up and sell when the manager is down. IMO this last month or so has been the best buying opportunity for ARK in a decent while

2021-05-04 12:07:10,wallstreetbets,How fast do the flip homes? If inventory is kept for minimal amount of time their losses won't be significant if market collapse.
2021-05-04 01:30:49,wallstreetbets,"Don't underestimate people's stupidity. Lots of people would pay huge premiums for hands off services like carvana , open, rocket mortgage, etc. Especially when the industry is full of shitbags and useless folks. All it would take is 1 bad experience with a real estate agent to have most people say fuck it and just cash out through opendoor. Having open houses and stuff is a pain for most busy professionals. Even cleaning their house to take photos for an agent is annoying.

I sold my house for 180k through an agent. I thought i could only get 160k for it. If someone from opendoor contacted me first and offered me a quick 155k i probably would have just done it. Sure i would have lost 25k but it was 25k that 1. I didn't know was there - and didn't believe I could get and 2. The only reason why i was hesitant on selling my house is because i didn't have time to go through all of the hassle."
2021-05-03 22:24:49,wallstreetbets,Not a valid argument when shit like Carvana and CarMax are doing great...
2021-05-04 00:50:04,wallstreetbets,Carvana doing excellent. Bye bye little salesman.
2021-05-03 23:21:56,wallstreetbets,"Well no the thing is; a lot of people are trying to buy a home, but inventory is abysmally low while cost for new construction is higher than ever. Insult to buyers is the historic low interest rate nevertheless cash is king. Even Keith won’t want to pay the middle man, but that’s hard to step around for purchases in this market especially for out of state investments/ retirement condos for snowbirds and whatnot. If OPEN can compete in markets across all 50 states then this might be akin to Air BnB in terms of convenience but without the headache of two other agents involved and all the hoopla they can drag you through.

EDIT:

Okay, I browsed around a little bit and overall negative sentiment on Opendoor. 

Sales commission is still 6%  so I wouldn't necessarily consider that cutting the middle man and that's if you sell to them. If you're buying there is no price consideration for not having a buyer's agent and honestly, you would be naive to do that to yourself. If issues do arise after the sale you're gonna be shit out of luck picking through the legal paperwork on your own with no help from a reputable broker whose rep. would otherwise be on the line. There is an upside to selling to them, that is you get a streamlined process and a mostly decent offer. To be fair though, in this market any house that can be considered ""move-in ready"" in an appreciating neighborhood can be sold in less than a month."

2021-05-04 10:43:37,wallstreetbets,It's basically unsustainably high and unaffordable right now. Only investors can buy a house average joe can't afford it so this will eventually lead to crash. You'd be amazed at the number of multi generational homes my mom sold the past few years. Noone affords it on their own anymore.
2021-05-03 20:08:38,wallstreetbets,Because people are panic buying. Houses are being bid $40k over list and tossing the appraisal to the wind. This does nothing but ask for trouble. Companies like Opendoor also help drive costs up with quick flips... And the current lumber problem is causing new build prices to rise as well... It'll stop when people aren't really able to afford... Which they can't right now because those stimmies are going to stop.

As you say the money I leave on the table is not realized and so I have a much smaller attachment to it. Also, the convenience factor is worth tens of thousands to me. Especially when I'm looking to buy and move, I dont want the added stress of planning to sell. 

I didn't plan on walking into an instant increase in home value when I bought. Lots of people like me will see it as an opportunity. Sure I could have gotten more, but I'll still probably walk away from this place with a profit.

Opendoor, rdfn, zillow. This is the future."

I recently bought a Model S and I did not choose Carvana as they were way overpriced and often was selling a lower end model as the higher end one. I had to check the vins myself on Carvana and found half of the models claiming to be Model S Performance where just regular Model S.

2021-05-03 22:01:38,wallstreetbets,"For me it was just so. damn. easy. No showings, no hassle, no last minute repairs. Initial inspection, final inspection, sign here sir. For me the appraisal was in line with the market so it was great."
2021-05-04 15:59:01,wallstreetbets,"I also sold my home to them in 2018.

""Fair"" deal is exactly the way to describe it. Not a killing, but not a lowball either.  They were in exactly the right place to be to make it worth avoiding the hassle of traditional selling.  I was used to the ""We buy houses"" folks that offer 40% of the value, that's not them.

That said, if I was selling my house today, in THIS market, I wouldn't use them just because of the easy money that would be left on the table.  But it's not going to be this market forever, right?

My experience was very very good.  It's enough to make me think about getting in cheap for the long haul for when the housing market stabilizes again."
2021-05-04 19:30:49,wallstreetbets,"They sold at market price. Basically they paid me the market appraisal minus 8% service fee. No realtor fees, no repair costs. For me it was just how easy the process of selling was."
2021-05-04 02:19:41,wallstreetbets,"I suspect the pandemic affected the inner operations of the company. Quality control, IT, sales, marketing, accounting, etc., were all affected to some degree.

Whereas RKT had several years under them, being founded in 1985."

I keep telling them get the job you might hate but pays the most. Read everything you can about trading and live with your parents until your 28.

2021-05-03 20:35:21,wallstreetbets,yeah that’s right. Still what the guy said doesn’t make a lot of sense. Taking losses on some homes doesn’t equate to “go out of business immediately”.

It also took a couple months for them to sell it at that price.  The market was much different than it is at the moment.  But the fact that it took a couple months to sell further justified that I made the right choice to sell it to them and get out."

2021-05-04 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Corn: Ethanol Demand, Lack of Supply, Odd Weather and Expensive Inputs TLDR: **Long July corn** (futures preferred) although any ETF with exposure to cash corn would be OK. There are also options on corn. I'm sorry if you can't trade futures. The next contract in September would not be preferred since that's the start of the harvest which usually runs into November.

If you have been watching the news, expensive agriculture has been nothing new in the past month. That shouldn't be too worrying, since the May Corn which set a high at $7.40/bsh was due to lack of old-stored stock because no one planted that much or thought to store that much during the recession. This is kinda like the opposite of the negative oil prices last year when there was 0 demand and full storage, because right not there is quite brisk demand (not from food, but ethanol producers) and rapidly decreasing grain stores. July corn should also face the exact same problem, possibly worse as fertilizer prices are climbing and a few other factors detailed below.

**Ethanol Demand**: Who uses the most corn? Nope, not farmers for feed or your fat wife but ethanol producers. What happens to all that ethanol? Except for some good ol' states like Oklahoma which sells mostly 100% pure American anticommunist gasoline, the ethanol is used for fuel. A quick google search will yield [articles reporting that fuel demand for end of March has surpassed levels set during 2020](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-products-gasoline/u-s-gasoline-demand-exceeds-2020-levels-for-first-time-in-2021-opis-idUSKBN2BM1UR). Americans are driving/traveling again as more and more of us are getting vaccinated, simply don't care, or are forced to commute back to the office. This will result in continued high demand for gasoline, and thus ethanol.

**Lack of Supply**: This is the critical part that resulted in May Corn's sharp rise. Supply as of right now might not be getting better, and thus should also play into July Corn's pricing. These are largely weather based, but starting with...

**Corn Stocks are still trending down**: If you've ever watched Trading Places and wondered if you can make a killing on the [crop report](https://www.nass.usda.gov/Publications/), here's your chance. This is the March 2021 grains report, and the headline is that [Corn stocks are -3% from 2020](https://downloads.usda.library.cornell.edu/usda-esmis/files/xg94hp534/db78v700p/7p88db273/grst0321.pdf). But this doesn't show the trend. Flip to page 4.

Essentially all the 2020 harvest should be accounted for in December 2020 (harvest for corn is usually Sept - Nov). The demand is almost 250 million bushels more than the similar timeframe from last year. Also remember when looking at the March 2020 data below, that is when gasoline demand and food demand dropped through the floor. We're not going to get any new corn until September, so this summer of relying on what we have still in storage is going to get tight.

https://preview.redd.it/whrhpl4e8zw61.png?width=756&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1c85216ec9a6834a0cf5fb211fc897714b8656b

**Weather pt1 Droughts**: Even though weather this summer won't affect July corn which should already be in storage, inclement weather might force users to bring forward their deliveries, because they won't be sure if their September/December stocks will even be there. Right now, the midwest is starting to see[signs of a drought](https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/) (if you're going to trade this, this site has to become your new bookmarked page). A look at the historical patterns, and you can see more and more of the midwest is [facing inclement drought conditions](https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/CurrentMap/StateDroughtMonitor.aspx?Midwest).

**Weather pt2 Odd Weather Patterns**: Now I haven't read any scholarly articles for this, but doesn't it seem weather is odd this year for most of the country? First the [big winds from last year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_2020_Midwest_derecho), then the early 2021 [big polar vortex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/February_2021_North_American_cold_wave) that made a big V shape, and then sudden warming we're seeing now. I won't be so shocked if some big storm happens this summer to affect the heartland. Corn is very susceptible to storms because the roots are really shallow.

**Weather pt3 Stress**: In any case, the weather so far might be leading to stressed corn. I have some BS11 planted in the middle of Texas, and it's already tasseling without any ears. This may be due to heat and drought conditions, but in any case I've heard farmers' horror stories of having their entire acreage sold for sileage because not one ear grew. Here's a pic of mine. The corn is about 4ft tall right now.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/g9sgyn7bbzw61.jpg?width=2976&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=476caf52a3d8542e8e2048d5e456102d12f9a80d

&#x200B;

**High input costs**: This shouldn't color you shocked, but there's a [fertilizer shortage](https://www.agweb.com/news/crops/planting/fertilizer-shortage-ken-ferrie-weighs-fertilizer-issues-spring) going on too. You gotta use that and pesticides. I'm not sure if farmers have calculated this, but there's about at 20% increase in prices. Naturally I hope this means they're not willing to hedge their prices at a lower level (selling into the market), further helping prices go higher.

&#x200B;

**Other considerations**: Corn is an international crop, but most of it is in the US. Brazil and Ukraine should have good planting, but once again that shouldn't affect July because of the supply/demand imbalance. There's also something about a locust infestation in Indiana. But, [plantings are increasing at a brisk pace](https://www.agweb.com/news/crops/planting/corn-planting-progress-leaps-29-points-beats-2020s-historic-jump). That might be why prices dropped today which I bought into.

These are my positions. I look forward to keep buying 2-5 contracts at a time and holding towards expiration in 57 days.

The expectation is that earnings will be good, but the future doesn't look as good as last year."

And TSLA was the envy of the the EV space. The reason they were undervalued (or overvalued now) is because their other impending operations weren't considered.

Dan's not quite Elon, and RKT isn't TSLA, but you get the point. It is a dynamic at the heart of that debate. Judging by last earning it is contested, to say the least."

It's a crapshoot. About the best you can do is look at prior earnings results and corresponding response for the same stock.  In RKTs case on incredible earnings last time, it went up a little, stalled, shot up more, then back to earth."

2021-05-03 20:47:44,wallstreetbets,when you average down you decrease the cost-per-share basis and increase your share quantity. Therefore when stock does moon you get more tendies.
2021-05-04 02:12:54,wallstreetbets,If you have a bunch of test scores where 1 score is a 99 and the rest are 50's what's the average score of the group...?
2021-05-04 06:34:46,wallstreetbets,"They are still there.  As you average down, you can get out at break even at a lower share price.  Your gains from lower sp purchases negate the losses from higher sp purchases."
2021-05-04 08:49:01,wallstreetbets,If loweres your break even point. If you bought at 20 it drops to 10 you could average down to say 15 now if the stock goes up to 15 you can get out and break even or make money at anything higher.

2021-05-03 23:32:34,wallstreetbets,I have over 2k January 2023 5$ strike and 2k January 2023 7$ strikes I bought back when they were 20-30 cents.  I traded some on the last spike and dug back in ready for the next spike.  Hold on to the rocket and ride baby.
2021-05-03 23:43:19,wallstreetbets,"Too bad you missed the $4c 1/21/22 @ .60

2021-05-04 04:59:29,wallstreetbets,"Hey all, sad to see this happened. Anyway I'm doubling osrs gold by the grand exchange. Just trade me some gold and get double back. Somehow I get the feeling you guys are the perfect audience for such a great deal."

When I messaged him for the next step, idiot had the audacity to reply back with..

2021-05-04 09:18:13,wallstreetbets,Lol I lost 2 BNB. Sent 1 and he said minimum is 2 BNB. I was suspicious but it was my first time doing a presale. I was prepared to get screwed with a potentially worthless coin but not no coin at all.
2021-05-04 09:22:04,wallstreetbets,Did you see they got Justin Bieber on board and he's donating 2% of whole supply. Sounds too good to be true but I will try it

2021-05-04 06:41:01,wallstreetbets,"ahaha, i actually fell for the scam but only lost 0.001 ether (or something similar in transfer fee).
i was like, ok, send some eth and give it a try, 300.000 followers after all and so many votes and stuff.
but i was too stupid to copy the address and instead sent it to myself. only today i realized this lucky mistake.
yesterday after seeing that my eth immediately returned i thought, well, seems like i missed the presale, but at least these are some honest dudes.
today i'm just very amused by myself."
2021-05-04 15:03:59,wallstreetbets,I knew something was wrong because the dude was Hella annoying and had chat blocked.

2021-05-04 11:26:44,wallstreetbets,"I'm one of the victim.

How it works is they told us they gonna release new coin named WSBFinance and we can get the pre-sale price which is cheaper than the actual price when it got listed.

The time i saw the news it was already at 10k/15k BNB and i don't have much time to do my research and blindly send 1 BNB to them.

A sec i send it i know i'm scammed. Guess what ? They keep increasing the total amount of BNB for pre-sale to 25k !! 

And when the last time i check on the address it has around 27k BNB."
2021-05-04 09:16:30,wallstreetbets,I'm genuinely interested how much money you make on this. There must be some perv on the internet thinking this sounds like a swell deal.

2021-05-04 06:25:45,wallstreetbets,I sent 15$ but it means so much more to me.

**Short Interest**

Short interest on $X is 17% as of today. Citadel is obviously among who’s shorting it.

&#x200B;

**My Plan**

In the last five years this stock almost always rose at least 30% with last year being the first time it dipped a bit. I have no position yet on this stock but a buy order set at $22.50 since friday; I'm confident it will dip following today's sharp 8% rise. You have to decide whether you want to play this for a month or six months, the weekly chart shows that this could probably shoot to $50 by end of year but i’m confident that if people discover about this hidden gem it could do it by mid summer and why not, go even higher. In any case I don’t see this crashing hard since it’s a strong company, and because it has a mid market cap if it runs it will almost certainly not be stopped by a shitty offering.

And with the obsession of interest rates it may not be this week either. But I've averaged down and I'm not interested in timing the market because I don't have those kind of resources.

2021-05-04 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"RKT earnings options play Right now, I see a unique options play on RKT earnings. If you were to acquire some OTM call options for the may 7th 23.50 strike, if the calls go in the money and you pay 50 bucks for each contract, big fat ROI over  5 day time period.

Current vol and open interest on the call side is rather high. We are not seeing a ton of trading volume for the shares of RKT, but I personally believe this is the calm before the storm.

Therefore - I believe the price of RKT call options are grossly mispriced and the potential for the stock to move 10% or higher shortly before and after earnings is somewhere in the neighborhood of 25-40%. Historically this has happened before so it's not outside the realm of possibility. Because the stock stays stable for so long, calls are much cheaper than gambling on something like MVIS or GME (I guess due to implied volatility being lower comparatively).

The keener among you may have seen how this played out with short dated Tesla options on last Friday. The stock was trading down.. then did a complete upwards reversal, turning 1500 dollar call options into 30,000-50000 dollars in one day for seemingly no reason.

Usually I never take the risk on short dated OTM calls but this time it's different. I think there is too much evidence stacking up to the fact that RKT has something under their sleeves for this earnings call. Fundamentally I expect a strong beat.. but they could also announce another special dividend or stock buyback. This is your time to buy the rumor sell the news.

TLDR, buy lots of RKT call options expiring 5/7 at the 23.50 strike or higher. I'm holding 2 contracts at the 23.50 may 7 strike. I plan on scoping more contracts up if the stock falters tomorrow then holding through earnings. If you want less risk - you can opt for the longer dated contracts just in case the market is stupid and doesn't react to RKT earnings by Friday. Just keep in mind that the further out in date you go - the more expensive the contracts are. I guess you COULD just buy shares too. There is more upside with calls, albeit you are risking more in exchange for the increased leverage.

This was erroneously labeled as a meme stock by media. It’s not. It’s a multi billion dollar fintech GIANT and will be recognized as such soon enough. Should have a fintech like P/E soon. With the upcoming launch of Rocket Auto they will be taking over the auto industry just as they have the mortgage industry. Not to mention the 14 other companies under the Rocket name.

That’s why I phrased my thesis with “I believe” instead of “according to implied volatility”

implied volatility is overstated so it’s nice to have the IV for context but it’s not going to make you a crystal ball fortune teller."

2021-05-04 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Why You Should Short The Intel Fab Play Intel has risen on news that it will spend $20B on establishing chip manufacturing factories in Arizona, but this news is more bearish than bullish to me.

Investing in Intel now, is nonsensical once you consider the full situation. I reiterate my bearish position on Intel and recommend a diagonal put play.

I’ve more-or-less officially been an Intel bear for a few months now. As of late, many have asked me whether I am changing my stance on Intel due to its $20B manufacturing facility (FAB) production project. As much as I would love to reverse directions and proclaim myself a born-again Intel bull, I must objectively call Intel’s announcement as another bearish catalyst. In light of this news, I am happy to double down. Today, I will explain my viewpoint.

*The Fab Ahab:*

Ahab was the seventh king of Israel. He inherited a powerful kingdom but was eventually brought down due to his own vices and not upholding his responsibilities. Many consider Ahab to be Israel’s worst king.

Intel shares many similarities with Ahab. The company easily dominated the chip kingdom with its x86 IP, but this made Intel a bit too complacent: Easy money from x86 led the company to focus more on maintaining the status quo than moving the foundry market forward. In its comfort, Intel has lost its partnership with Apple (AAPL), who has successfully developed M1, a chip much more efficient than the previously used Intel x86 chips; failed to keep up with the shrinking node trends, currently struggling to produce 10nm chips while others are working on 3nm; and has even been overtaken by AMD, which long sat in Intel’s giant shadow. Intel’s story – to me – looks like a downfall story in the making.

Intel finally sees the need to fight back, and the two fabs in Arizona, due 2024, at the cost of $20B is the latest strategy. However, it is a risky strategy. Adding fabs to the business is not just a one-time cost of the $20B but requires consistent upkeep and upgrade costs, something more like $20B per year, which, over the coming decade, would be more than Intel’s total current equity. Intel is thus further adding operational costs to its business during a time when the company is expected to see shrinking revenue and earnings. Typically, the responsible reaction to such earnings decay is to cut down on costs. Intel would seemingly rather throw Hail Marys.

*Hail Mary:*

I call the fab announcement a Hail Mary not because adding fabs is inherently a bad idea but because Intel seems to have little time remaining on the clock to benefit from this action before it finds itself well behind its competitors. Intel should have built fabs years ago when it was still the market leader and still growing earnings. Intel could have become the go-to chip manufacturer in the US, but now it faces an uphill battle in light of how strong Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) and Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) have grown over the past decade.

At roughly the same time as Intel’s announcement to build fabs in Arizona, TSMC (henceforth TSM) announced its own fab construction in Arizona. Clearly, there is a rush to build fabs in the US, and the reason, too, is clear: China. The US reliance on Taiwanese fabs combined with increasing concerns over a Chinese invasion of Taiwan means that the US would love a modern fab stateside. That is, Intel’s decision to create fabs at this time was not decided in a vacuum; instead of the decision being a business-focused decision, it is a situation-focused decision – a decision of convenience rather than one for the sake of shareholders.

*Intel’s Fab Focus In Question:*

Intel could be attempting to cozy up to the US government with its new fabs. The Department of Defense certainly wants some fabs stateside as China’s shadow grows over Taiwan. Intel might be playing the Tesla (TSLA) game by looking for taxpayers to help subsidize its business, gaining a novel edge over AMD.

In any case, I don’t see the news fabs to be transformative for Intel in the positive sense. If Intel is really going all-in on fabs, we will need many years before we see a significant payoff. Investing in INTC now, during a time of nose-bleed tech valuations and during earnings contractions is not a smart investment decision.

And if Intel is looking for government subsidies by being the main US chip manufacturer, this is essentially a white flag; Intel cannot compete in the game of technological advancements and needs a handicap. This is not Tesla being subsidized as it forays into a fledgling industry but an old, stubborn company attempting to stay afloat via means outside its own merits. You would be better off investing in AMD or TSMC if you want exposure in US chip design or manufacturing.

Overall, I reiterate my bearish outlook on Intel relative to the rest of the chip industry. The upward momentum in Intel and its current price are not sustainable by the news: The fabs and other aspects I’ve mentioned in previous articles are perceived as bullish while they are in fact bearish."
2021-05-03 21:33:03,wallstreetbets,Intel has partnerships with US government laboratories across the country. I think the US gov will let Intel look behind the curtain to get a leg up. The US views chip dominance as defense spending people. The most advanced chips delivers the dominant military advantages.

2021-05-04 01:22:18,wallstreetbets,"Agreed!  Big mistake by Intel.  They need to make better CPUs and embrace ARM as it's the future of everything rather than trying to make Fabs.  Focus on your core competency, don't try to create a new one especially since history has shown you sucked at it (making fabs)."

2021-05-04 08:42:56,wallstreetbets,"I agree, but be carefull from quantum i expect intel to come back strong in 5-10 years so if i played bear side i would try to exit position in next 4 years.

Pple say quantum pcs arent meant for personal computing and only good on some applications, guess what application they good at? Destroying whole cybersecurity as if it never existed; i expect quantum being needed to defend from quantum and that means a big af wave of demand and high institutional adoption; then again if mastodontic amounts of money are thrown into it maybe they even get usefull as personal pcs who knows."

2021-05-04 15:29:37,wallstreetbets,"The best way to play the increase in fabs is to invest in Tin. They use it for solder. Over 50% of the tin produced goes to solder. It's currently in a shortage and will remain short for decades until it is depleated.

$AFMJF🚀🚀🚀 is the only tin miner you can buy stock for. Compare it to a copper or silver miner and its dirt cheap.

$JJT🚀🚀🚀 are 2038 tin futures via Barclay ETN

They had more silver on hand then tin at the LME back in February.  Now that's a short squeeze.🚀🚀🚀 Given the spot prices run in the last week, I suspect the same thing is happening right now. I'm kind of excited to see the spot price update tonight.

Why have you never heard about tin and always hear about copper and silver? Because it's a small niche market and most analyst companies don't even cover it. 

Go check out tins spot price performance vs copper vs silver

Then if you look at the semi wiki's, Samsung is expected to get worse while Intel passes them. TSMC likely wont be passed unless there is some major issue, but TSMC currently cant keep up with demand, even before the pandemic, which is why Apple gets basically a year of the latest node before AMD or Nvidia even have a chance to use it."

The dog, being dumb as shit, got scared of the voices and started trying to get away. My dad, also now dumb as shit, decided to stand there shining his flashlight back and forth against the wall for nearly 10 minutes - trying to see what the dog was afraid of. We go to that park every night. He just John Travolta giffed from Pulp Fiction, looking back and forth for 10 straight minutes before I told him we should go."

Dear [u/MemesThatDiedInNew2](https://www.reddit.com/u/MemesThatDiedInNew2/), this is my formal reply to the comments you made about me; your words are insignificant to me as you have called me a little b-word. I am deeply disgusted by your slanderous comment and would like you to apologize for your misuse of the b-word.

Also, I have a life outside of Reddit. I have a dog that I walk every single day, I have a couple of friends that I hang out with, and I work at Burger King. I have a life bro. You seem to be jealous of the fact that I gained some “precious karma”. Get over it, dude. There’s no point in calling me a little b-word."

**SPY 6/18 $320** calls are at the last price of **98.10** which gives us a total value of:

Bill watches John Oliver religiously.

It was humiliating. Bill was furious. It rekindled the pain he felt as a kid, before the money, before the fame, when he was nobody. The nerd who got picked on, bullied. He had big ideas but he was still dismissed and unheard. His ego couldn't take another second being connected to an inferior partner.  She made him look bad. And, of all people, his favorite satirist delivered the fatal blow.

2021-05-04 04:56:40,wallstreetbets,"OCGN - If you are long be carful. This fucker is about to plummet. 

Yes I’m shorting them mainly based on valuation. However now I’m going tenfold my shorts. 

1. I had no idea OCGN had just announced and approved yet another $100MM Capital Raise (diluting investors) 

2. In the last 3 days between their CEO, CFO and   two other senior managers they sold over $12MM worth of insider shares. The last large lots where just sold yesterday and probably will unload more today. (Reference; Market Beat) 

3. On top of of that remember they report on Friday and we all know they won’t beat their numbers or simply use some of the newly minted cash and pose it as revenue. 

4. Their vax won’t make the cut and even if it does it will be way too late and don’t know of anyone who would take their shitty vax when they have options. Look at NVAX they have been waiting for a while and the EU finally said yes but it won’t happen until 2023.  By then all the wealthy countries will have all the vaccines they need.  

If you still want to keep your position good for you and just hope you are able to pawn  your diamond hands"

2021-05-03 23:32:46,wallstreetbets,"This sub is going more to shit every day. This discussion post was deleted for not getting enough upvotes:

High inflation won't happen

The Fed can raise interest rates to infinity in lock step with rising prices to tame inflation when they want. This Fed power is far more effective than money printer go brrrr. Right now, they *want* asset inflation, which through a wealth effect, stimulates aggregate demand. JPow doesn't want or need to spook markets. Markets obey him.

The lessons from the 18/19 market tantrums, Europe after the 08 crisis, and Japan's lost decade were that stagflation (moderate inflation, rolling recessions) has a gravitational pull. It is better to risk moderately higher average inflation in the short to medium term to reach escape velocity. 🚀

Current sources of inflation are tied to asset inflation (housing inputs) and only seem dramatic in the the short to medium term. The Fed is comfortable with this because they want the wealth effect from asset inflation. This will make people feel rich so they spend freely as COVID goes away.

Also, the Fed has orders of magnitude more data and gets it at speeds that were unimaginable four decades ago. Why four decades? That's how long it's been since we had an inflation problem!

The Fed will coast or feather the brake pedal to slow down, instead of stomping down on repurchases. They've learned how to do so from the 2018/2019 market tantrum. The Fed is correct to be much more concerned about escaping stagflation."

It seems like it should be obvious, but let's say I place an order for a share of GME at 150 while the price is shown as $151, and when I refresh it shows the order as ""confirmed"". Almost immediately the price of GME goes up to 170, and keeps going up, not ever coming back to 150 for the rest of the day. Does ""confirmed"" imply that the order will fill eventually, or will GME have to come back to 150 for that to happen?"

2.  It was a pre planned sale of stock 
3. If they mention future earnings due to vaccine or any sort of potential sales in the pipeline for vaccine it will go up 
4. This is just rambling nonsense and doesn’t even deserve a dispute. 

Ocgn is the top performing stock in a 52 month period. Is it a little high? Maybe but still small market cap. You idiots really are allergic to making money aren’t you"

Look motherfuckers, this is not legal financial advice... I believe this play is backed by strong fundamentals. First and foremost, they tripled revenue in FY20 while managing to keep expenses flat - as analogous to FY19. ROE % for the quarter that ended December 2020: 136.44%.

1. Low interest rates will be a catalyst for sizeable earnings this quarter. Everyone is refinancing their homes amidst the market euphoria.
2. The stock is intrinsically undervalued, I'll link a DD that explains it: [https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/les0ok/rocket\_companies\_rkt\_dd\_on\_an\_undervalued\_gem/](https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/les0ok/rocket_companies_rkt_dd_on_an_undervalued_gem/)

(05/07 $27 Call)

(05/07 $31 Call)

I'll probably sell if we see a sizeable run-up right before earnings. Also I may hold through earnings if I feel lucky...

2021-05-03 20:22:16,wallstreetbets,"RKT absolutely will explode. You can’t compare this to other companies ER. This will more than just the expected blowout earnings. Everyone knows they have a huge announcement. Either divi, big time acquisition, something. Not to mention that 500milli block that was bought at $25. This was erroneously labeled as a meme stock by media. It’s not. It’s a multi billion dollar fintech GIANT and will be recognized as such soon enough. Should have a fintech like P/E soon. With the upcoming launch of Rocket Auto they will be taking over the auto industry just as they have the mortgage industry. Not to mention the 14 other companies under the Rocket name. A true disrupter in every sense of the word. Undervalued is an understatement. See you at $55+ soon."

2021-05-04 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"My two favorite recover plays. ASO and CLNE Alright, the weekends now over but that doesn't matter for most of you since Wendy's never closes and you need to work overtime to keep losing it on Robinhood with stupid FD's. Reading this won't take long and you can go back to using your lunch breaks to give discounted blowjobs next to the dumpster to support your ""grind.""

I am here to talk about my two favorite plays at the moment which you've either forgotten since reading it in the post title or you're just too retarded to know the tickers. It's fucking Academy Sports and Clean energy. If you just spat out your fresh semen and crayon lunch then pop an Adderall and try to decipher the symbols on your screen that make up the English alphabet. If you need help download a synthetic voice text-to-speech program and have it read to you. If that still doesn't work, you are actually retarded and should go seek immediate help. Clip your helmets chin strap and text your wife's boyfriend to come pick her up this time so you don't get distracted by the moaning and macaroni noises in the bedroom.

First one, Academy Sports. Most of you unwashed neckbeards probably haven't stepped foot in an Academy Sports store because it promotes doing things outdoors. You'd just waltz around feeling guilty for gaining another 40 pounds during Covid and purchase a DD sports bra for your ""girlfriend"" even though the cute cashier knows you reek of desperation, she can even smell it with her mask on. It's okay because your card is going to be declined and you'll shamefully walk out while the repulsed cashier attempts to scrub your Cheeto dust and dandruff from the nooks and crannies of the card reader.

Academy Sports is an American sporting goods store chain. We are all well aware of the effects that Covid had on retail during 2020 and know it's been a total shit show. Academy reported earnings on March 30th and somehow, these motherfuckers blew the roof off.

 • Fourth Quarter and Full Year Comparable Sales Increased 16.1%

 • Fourth Quarter Gross Margin Rate Expanded 420 basis points over Q4 2019

 • Full Year Net Income Increased 157.2% over 2019 to $308.8 million

How did they do it? I have no fucking clue. Their e-commerce sales increased by a cool and modest 60.7%. Where the fuck did this demand come from? Looks like you guys were sitting around in your moldy basements jerking off to some other retard's gain porn while too ashamed to post your loss porn, and Academy Sports was out there busting loads on faces and you just wait on your knees and take them to the forehead, eyes wide open. (Makes no sense, you sick fucks act like getting sperm in your eyes is something you can add to a resume since you ""watched a lot of kids"") Anyways, here's an excerpt.

""While many of our categories benefited from the COVID-19 crisis, several of our key businesses such as licensed apparel, team sports equipment, apparel and footwear and back-to-school were adversely impacted and should return to normal this year. In addition to each of these businesses driving sales growth, they are all margin rate-accretive and should drive a return to a more traditional mix of sales. Fourth, we will improve our management of several seasonal categories where there are not worldwide inventory shortages, but where our initial inventory buy in 2020 was not enough to meet the strong demand. This year, we have modified our planning and allocation on products like grills and water sports to support additional sales compared to their normal trend line.

As we begin 2021, we are confident that we can continue to deliver strong results because of our incredible team, the continued development of our key initiatives, and the stronger, deeper relationships we have built with our customers. The company is providing the following estimate for fiscal 2021. Comparable sales are forecast to range from up 2% to down 2%. This is an 18% to 14% increase on a two year stacked basis.""

Okay great, so people bought a lot of workout equipment. Who cares? What you semen suckers fail to understand, is that some guys were able to find a woman that is attracted to them in a way that they will ACTUALLY have sex with them and sometimes that results in kids. Those kids have been at home all fucking year and their parents want them out of the house so they can fuck on the kitchen table again. Ding ding, those rusty gears in your seemingly empty head are starting to grind. Yes wow, vaccines are starting to become mainstream and everybody is pent up at home with their crotch goblins. Enter every single recreational sport available. Beyond boosts in kids sports equipment that we will probably see (this part of my DD is literally just my personal social media feed where everybody on Facebook and Instagram is doing anything in their power to get the kids out of the house and bragging about it) we are obviously going into outdoor season. That means camping, vacations swimming and other things people with active and healthy lifestyles do. Academy Sports has it all. Tents, grills, coolers, clothing, swimsuits, fishing gear, canoes, sleeping bags. Do me a favor, walk into an Academy Sports store and look at the demand for yourself.

I obviously expect that Academy Sports will continue to exceed expectations and I am not the only one. Show me another stock with a 100% buy rating and if you're too lazy, type in ASO on Robinhood and look for yourself. Now I'm going to get into the most interesting part. ASO has a 100% buy rating from 8 different analysts. blew away earnings during a pandemic and has amazing financials and a healthy balance sheet. It's kind of weird that it is 9th on the most shorted stock list when every other company on that list looks like it could use some adrenaline shots or life support. ASO was previously the most shorted stock on the market a few weeks ago. If I had a guess, it looks like shorters realized they shorted a company that didn't deserve to be, and they want to cover before wallstreetbets gets a sniff of it. Oops, it's too late now.

Dick's Sporting Goods is trading at a PE ratio of 14 and has a short interest of 16%. Academy Sports is sitting at an SI of 33.62% and a PE ratio of 8. Seems a little bit fishy to me and smells like a ripe vagina is wafting the room. What could these large funds know that we don't? Hmmm.. let's try nothing and the fact that they were hoping to capitalize on another seemingly Covid ravaged retailer. (Does this remind you of anything else?) I am not going to sell this to you as a short squeeze because those only happen when you have a very tight float on a company where buyers start jumping in droves while short sellers are already underwater in their positions. Also interesting because at the end of March it went from around $24.50 to around $32.00 and the price hasn't gone below $28.39. Also of note, the average 10 day trading volume for ASO is 1.584M. The entire float is 40,436,703 shares with 33.62% of the float shorted, leaves you 13,594,583 shares short. That gives you 9 days to cover with average volume if they did nothing but buy and were the only ones doing so. Do what you will with that information or go do the math yourself. To me, it looks like some retards with a lot of capital put themselves in another bad situation. (Most recent rating from a JP Morgan analyst moves it from $32 to $35. If you're comparing companies in the same sector, who would you prefer to make your long AND short bets on? Operating income of Academy Sports at 129M in 2019, 222M in 2020 and 424M in 2021 with a smaller PE ratio, or Dick's with 445M in 2019, 409M in 2020, or 741M in 2021 and a PE ratio twice that of the former?

I already know you little asshats get mad when you see a DD on a stock only after it's up 150% for the week, but this is one of those times when this post was made while the stock is down 3% for the week and up 10% for the month.

I do also want to give some credit to /u/XionTG for the predictions below that he made a month ago. They turned out to be spot on, even though he got a lot of flack in the comments.

Predictions:

My Target Prices

First short-term target price: $30 by 5/1

Second short-term target price: $60 by 7/1

​

(You can see his original DD here but I will warn you degenerate retards that this DD is from the r-investing crowd so don't pucker your asshole up too tight or your heads might explode and your balls could drop).

​

Next one, CLNE (Clean Energy)

""Clean Energy is changing the way the world fuels its vehicles. Reducing pollution from the transportation industry is an important goal for our nation, and we at Clean Energy know just how realistic and attainable that goal is with natural gas fuel.

Moving forward in our thinking as well as in our vehicles means a safer, healthier planet for all of us. This change is happening. Natural gas is abundant and economically viable and is increasingly being adopted as transportation fuel by countries around the world.""

Hmmm, I can't even begin to imagine what type of political administration or historical time (notably marked by unprecedented climate change) when a company providing an alternative to diesel, especially one that is clean and readily available, could POSSIBLY flourish. I was a truck driver for some time and pumped over $500 dollars of fuel into my semi each day. Looking over the finances, fuel prices accounted for 20% more than the cost of the 2 drivers to work over the road on a weekly basis. Fuel is generally the highest percentage of operating costs in the freight transportation business. We are set to enter into a period of economic recovery and anyone with half a brain synapse knows freight transportation is at the heart of industry. Not that this is entirely related, but Amazon just posted a round of earnings that once again, exceeded expectations. Amazon's sales increased by a modest 44 fucking percent. Why does it matter? Shut the fuck up and keep reading. ""[Clean Energy] signed an agreement with Amazon to provide low and negative carbon renewable natural gas, as 27 of its existing fueling stations and another 19 new or upgraded stations."" Yeah you read that correctly, Amazon sales blow the fuck up and they have found a place that they can cut operating costs and it just so happens to be through a partnership with the only other company that has the infrastructure to support them in this endeavor. It goes without saying that the current administration is going to be pushing for renewable and clean energy harder than your wife threw you out of the house when her boyfriend showed up with a bottle of lube and his extra thick cock ring.

Also noteworthy.

""UPS Makes Largest Purchase of Renewable Natural Gas Ever in the U.S.

Seven-Year 170 Million Gallon Equivalents Purchase from Clean Energy Fuels Corp. Will Reduce GHG Emissions by More than 1 Million Metric Tons."" Go look at their press releases if you want to see their other partnerships.

I have attached another DD done by /u/twenty98 about CLNE that was well done. We also know that /u/NrdRage made a very good DD as well so go read it because I'm not going to retype it and in any way attempt to take credit for their work. I am not sitting here saying I love the stock, to be honest, I love the company and what it does. Reducing emissions in one of the industries with an oversized carbon footprint is a home run for me. Just as Tesla and electric vehicles are the future, alternative fuels will fill the gaps where batteries cannot support. 

I don't really care what you spray paint huffing STD riddled idiots do, but in my opinion, both of these companies look like they have more potential than the current share price is demonstrating. CLNE is up 5% for the week and down 22% for the month. For those that figured out MVIS, CLOV and all the other bullshit, the time to buy into something isn't after it's up 120% in two days and Cramer mentions it. Find assets at a less retarded entry point. Good luck and go back to whatever smooth brained moron shit you were doing before seeing this.

​

That's the end of the post and that's all I got for you. Now you can return to the act of holding your wife's hair while she goes down on your neighbor! Thank me later.

2021-05-03 20:41:13,wallstreetbets,"Pretty interesting.. share repurchase near the all-time high is always a great vote of confidence. I imagine that when these kinds of secondary offerings are made, a bunch of investors' eyes turn towards the company's financials to check for a bargain - I hold ASO shares and options and believe it still is a MAJOR bargain around $31.

They took steps to pay down a bunch of debt with a couple great quarters - seems to me that a buyback is the next best choice for a company that isn't looking to pay a dividend and has excess cashflow over-and-above what is needed for their expansion plans. Most companies held cash through the pandemic, so to me ASO is signaling that the pandemic uncertainty may be behind them.

Couple other retailers that announced buybacks recently are DG and DLTR. Might want to take a look at when they announced their buyback and what they are trading at now.."

Their 2020 earnings paired with their JPM presentation last month have me bullish considering how low their estimated EPS is for Q1. From their JPM presentation it seemed like their only two points of concern from Q1 were the blizzard that rolled through Texas and inventory issues. Sounds like stores were only closed for a few days and imo that’s just sales delayed, not lost. As for inventory, they said overall their inventory is at comfortable levels with ammunition being the main stress point but that was only because it’s flying off the shelf so fast (which is what we were all expecting/hoping for)."

2021-05-03 20:09:51,wallstreetbets,I hope you're at least selling way OTM calls to reduce your costs or just reinvest those call sales into more shares lowering your avg cost.
2021-05-03 20:11:00,wallstreetbets,You are like in the parking lot on the gme we are playing right now so I don't feel sorry. Especially knowing the GOAT of basketball has been backing those people of shame.

2021-05-03 20:17:03,wallstreetbets,I believe $200k is the threshold where you have to watch the wife and boyfriend go at it and you're on the sideline spraying some lube on when instructed...
2021-05-03 20:17:15,wallstreetbets,"Can I fucking hide this, im not worth a 10th of this loss. Haha"

2021-05-03 20:35:52,wallstreetbets,"Lucky you aren't dabbling in ""agriculture""... you might have ""bought the farm"" LOL

That's a lot of ducketts to throw at a single hype BS stock.

Might want to diversify and buy a mix of more stable stocks like: COST, IWM, NEM, POOL, SMG, YETI, ..."

2021-05-03 21:20:02,wallstreetbets,15% in shares can bounce back given enough time. hold until NFL season at least. 40% though... that is rough but weed stocks will rebound eventually.
2021-05-03 21:20:29,wallstreetbets,Why buy all in 1 shot? Buy in small portions. Especially if chasing the stock up!

2021-05-03 21:59:22,wallstreetbets,"You bought tlry at 27$?!?! 

Yep. You retarded. Give him the keys, boys."
2021-05-03 22:00:13,wallstreetbets,What goes down must come up or something like that
2021-05-03 22:01:31,wallstreetbets,Gambling to gamble on a gambling stock.  This is the way.  Been a brutal 2 past months for the donkey. We're all starting to believe Wood is shorting. Feeling like we're stagnant til more states legalize.   Have had plenty of decent good news lately and it just rejects everything and tumbles more.  Nasdaq is 🔥 🗑.
2021-05-03 22:02:36,wallstreetbets,"Didn't say it did.
But then I would never lose $95K in a day like a total moron."
2021-05-03 22:02:56,wallstreetbets,Fucking retard

2021-05-03 22:12:05,wallstreetbets,Hey OP. You have 10000 shares. Start selling call options otm and avg down ifnu can
2021-05-03 22:13:00,wallstreetbets,"I was in a similar position as you, but I sold at a loss few days ago. I kinda felt it will go down to 45, but my crystal ball doesn’t work very well."
2021-05-03 22:14:34,wallstreetbets,i have a feeling this will do good friday??
2021-05-03 22:15:16,wallstreetbets,Its not a loss till you sell Mr. McPaperhands
2021-05-03 22:15:40,wallstreetbets,"If you did the DD yourself, entered at the best time, and stuck to your plan and played within ur risk tolerance then that's one thing.

The other is if you read somebody else's DD then threw 200k in which case welcome aboard"
2021-05-03 22:15:48,wallstreetbets,Just put your home on a second mortgage and double down on DKNG
2021-05-03 22:15:53,wallstreetbets,"DKNG...what exactly was the play here?

Also TLRY lol pot. Still, might as well hold there unless your wife's boyfriend needs money. They are making a few decent moves to setup a potentially booming 2021, but that market is so saturated, picking the real winners is like throwing a dart at a dartboard and not knowing where the bullseye is. Or should I say, each segment has a passionate autist with all this ""data"" and ""facts"" about why <insert random pot stock> is gonna boom soon."
2021-05-03 22:19:25,wallstreetbets,"Double Down oh, I heard if you always double down you can't lose oh, it works for roaring Kitty"

2021-05-03 22:24:30,wallstreetbets,Tell them your kid made them purchases and you didn't consent.
2021-05-03 22:25:48,wallstreetbets,"What made you think that investing in Draftkings was a good idea?

Buy some UPS tomorrow.  Sell it in 4 months.  Then buy Palantir and hold for 2 months.  Then just sit back and consider your life choices.  FFS do better."
2021-05-03 22:26:28,wallstreetbets,And here I just thought Draftkings sold beer. Who knew?
2021-05-03 22:29:59,wallstreetbets,"Don’t sell, hold"
2021-05-03 22:33:36,wallstreetbets,"Should’ve put it into RSI instead. Cannot believe DKNGs value relative to it, insanely undervalued."
2021-05-03 22:34:46,wallstreetbets,Your cost basis is only $66? Lol keep holding. It’s not like shares have an expiration date
2021-05-03 22:34:50,wallstreetbets,"That'll do, ape, that'll do."
2021-05-03 22:36:18,wallstreetbets,Maybe one in ten thousand or a hundred thousand that invest like this is a winner. Rather take a shot at Powerball.
2021-05-03 22:36:26,wallstreetbets,"You son of a bitch, you're in."
2021-05-03 22:37:04,wallstreetbets,"Draftkings is a good long-term stock, you'll be find in the end."
2021-05-03 22:45:17,wallstreetbets,I’m in the same boat but worse because mine is a call option and it will expire.  The only dang news about the company is from the darn attorneys.
2021-05-03 22:49:26,wallstreetbets,"That’s like the stock market right now in general 
Shitty !!!"
2021-05-03 22:51:16,wallstreetbets,Looks like a deep dkng

2021-05-03 23:06:14,wallstreetbets,Do a covered call to cut losses. Based on how things are setting up I see more downside would recommend a put spread as well.
2021-05-03 23:06:21,wallstreetbets,That’s false. You’ve been played twice
2021-05-03 23:06:36,wallstreetbets,Nice! This is the way

2021-05-03 21:46:15,wallstreetbets,I’m gonna be completely honest. I used to trade and stopped a while back. I’ve made way more off not investing than investing. Some people are the complete opposite.
2021-05-03 21:27:51,wallstreetbets,Yea idk why he is even worried about that if he’s dropping almost 570k and 170k. Sports gambling will only become legal in more and more states over the years. Hell I bought penn at 103 and it’s at 90 right now and I’m not even the slightest worried. But of course no one on this subreddit think long term from what it seems like.
2021-05-03 21:32:07,wallstreetbets,Tilray too. Their market share after the Aphria merger is going to lead to cannabis domination.

2021-05-03 20:08:32,wallstreetbets,Lol. I’m so glad my parents didn’t have money like that to give me. I feel like those people are such douchbags.
2021-05-03 20:08:50,wallstreetbets,❤️

2021-05-03 20:19:33,wallstreetbets,Where do you think this money I lost came from. It’s a violent circle.
2021-05-03 20:20:45,wallstreetbets,Up. Down. And around. Like a carousel. Like the world. We keep spinning. One step at a time. Breath
2021-05-03 20:21:34,wallstreetbets,Giggity.
2021-05-03 20:22:13,wallstreetbets,Sounds scary. I’d like to intern. In the back. With no responsibilities. If possible. Sir. Ma’am.

2021-05-03 20:36:17,wallstreetbets,I prefer CSP’s
2021-05-03 20:37:15,wallstreetbets,You could of. But now it’s gone. So. I guess not. Sorry
2021-05-03 20:37:48,wallstreetbets,Which ones the BS stock. Also. May I add”fuck diversification”
2021-05-03 20:37:56,wallstreetbets,Not anymore
2021-05-03 20:38:04,wallstreetbets,Friend
2021-05-03 20:38:17,wallstreetbets,In those plays. Yeah
2021-05-03 20:39:26,wallstreetbets,*trips stepping into the boat and falls into the water
2021-05-03 20:39:55,wallstreetbets,Shoulda done a lotta things.
2021-05-03 20:40:44,wallstreetbets,I prefer CSP’s😒
2021-05-03 20:41:03,wallstreetbets,I’ll drink it I swear.
2021-05-03 20:45:34,wallstreetbets,Weed and gambling bro. Weed and gambling.
2021-05-03 20:47:03,wallstreetbets,Me too Kyle. Me to
2021-05-03 20:49:49,wallstreetbets,Don’t be afraid young one. Let the light of gains shine upon our darkest times. May we fight evil together. And come out the valley of death. Stronger. Smarter. And able to read.
2021-05-03 20:50:12,wallstreetbets,Sup zach
2021-05-03 20:51:13,wallstreetbets,But I wanna be a part of something bigger than me. Bigger than you. Bigger than all of us. Together
2021-05-03 20:52:59,wallstreetbets,Sometimes you’re the drum. And sometimes you’re the drumstick. Or something like that.
2021-05-03 20:55:04,wallstreetbets,Amigo❤️
2021-05-03 20:57:31,wallstreetbets,I’d have to read some numbers and words on paper to give an opinion
2021-05-03 20:59:40,wallstreetbets,Little FOMO. Yes. But weed ain’t goin anywhere.
2021-05-03 21:00:13,wallstreetbets,Shhhhhhh......CSP’s
2021-05-03 21:00:27,wallstreetbets,I like you
2021-05-03 21:01:47,wallstreetbets,I carry a heavy burden. I will fight till I can no longer fight. But that day. Is not this day.
2021-05-03 21:02:12,wallstreetbets,For now....dun dun dunnnnnnnnmm
2021-05-03 21:03:13,wallstreetbets,I do like elephants. They so big
2021-05-03 21:04:08,wallstreetbets,So invest in pig flying genetic mutations. Got it
2021-05-03 21:04:54,wallstreetbets,From wallstreetbets style investing....it’s a circle. Violent. Mean. Circle.
2021-05-03 21:08:32,wallstreetbets,I mean I understand. The gains have pretty outrageous the last year. There’s tons of shares owned by early investors and employees that can only be sold at certain times. I bought because I truly believe in the next 2-3 years dkng will come out on top of the sector and most states will be legal. I’m less worried about short term.
2021-05-03 21:09:31,wallstreetbets,Oh no. I’ll take more of a hidden office position in the corner with minimum responsibility. Thanks.
2021-05-03 21:09:50,wallstreetbets,The nfl draft day? Or am I high
2021-05-03 21:12:05,wallstreetbets,That’s the point.....big casinos....BIG overhead. DraftKings is streamlined. Plus everything recently legalizing and continuing to legalize is pretty current so old casino stocks aren’t going to translate
2021-05-03 21:12:23,wallstreetbets,*blushes
2021-05-03 21:15:29,wallstreetbets,Amen

2021-05-03 21:23:59,wallstreetbets,If I was a motley fool subscriber I wouldn’t have made the money to be able to lose it. Dumb dumb
2021-05-03 21:24:42,wallstreetbets,What would you do with 5k
2021-05-03 21:29:19,wallstreetbets,But then I don’t get the rush that a plummeting account gives me
2021-05-03 21:29:30,wallstreetbets,We ok fam
2021-05-03 21:33:32,wallstreetbets,He bailed me out the first time. Said he wouldn’t again.
2021-05-03 21:36:28,wallstreetbets,There’s two pictures ya silly goose. But you are correct in the fact I can’t read no good. Blame my teachers.
2021-05-03 21:36:57,wallstreetbets,Np..........np?
2021-05-03 21:37:34,wallstreetbets,I think I’m lost actually.
2021-05-03 21:38:13,wallstreetbets,Who said I didn’t. 🔥💵
2021-05-03 21:39:10,wallstreetbets,I’m a slow learner. But I can learn. Sometimes.
2021-05-03 21:39:34,wallstreetbets,Gotta start somewhere.
2021-05-03 21:40:01,wallstreetbets,The king will rise from the ashes and sit in the throne when the dust settles.
2021-05-03 21:41:12,wallstreetbets,In hindsight it makes sense. Mm got me! Oh well indeed

2021-05-03 21:45:05,wallstreetbets,Poetry.
2021-05-03 21:46:38,wallstreetbets,This ones worth more though.
2021-05-03 21:48:41,wallstreetbets,A pure laugh is worth a thousand dollars. Or in this case 200k. 🙃
2021-05-03 21:49:58,wallstreetbets,Well I bought 105k ago. You are in a much better position than me. Honestly my bet is that the fed will legalize within the year. Weed will boom over the next 5 years. And I think tilray will come out too 3 in the sector. I’m in it for the long haul.
2021-05-03 21:50:48,wallstreetbets,What does that company do
2021-05-03 21:51:27,wallstreetbets,🍀
2021-05-03 21:52:23,wallstreetbets,Why would anyone fake being down money.
2021-05-03 21:56:33,wallstreetbets,Something like 85% of all options are money losers lol
2021-05-03 21:52:40,wallstreetbets,Those are my favorite
2021-05-03 21:59:26,wallstreetbets,One pant leg at a time
2021-05-03 22:00:23,wallstreetbets,That doesn’t drop my average price silly goose. I prefer CSP’s anyway.
2021-05-03 22:00:48,wallstreetbets,Thanks
2021-05-03 22:01:49,wallstreetbets,It was at least after the bounce at 20 🤣☠️
2021-05-03 22:03:25,wallstreetbets,I kneel before the king and offer my sword. I will fight to protect the kingdom at all costs. ( but also sell some CSP’s)
2021-05-03 22:04:38,wallstreetbets,Then why don’t you think I am selling them? That’s not daily dumb dumb.
2021-05-03 22:04:49,wallstreetbets,Awh shucks ❤️
2021-05-03 22:05:27,wallstreetbets,Nah I don’t like people

2021-05-03 22:15:16,wallstreetbets,Only god knows that answer
2021-05-03 22:15:51,wallstreetbets,Hey. They are cardboard. Not paper.
2021-05-03 22:16:15,wallstreetbets,I can’t read
2021-05-03 22:16:27,wallstreetbets,Lol. I don’t own a home
2021-05-03 22:18:10,wallstreetbets,Dkng. Play the volatility to sell CC’s and CSP’s while establishing a long position for a company I believe will come out number 1 in a booming sector over the next 5 years as more states legalize and they find their groove with sports and casino gambling. 🤷‍♂️
2021-05-03 22:20:12,wallstreetbets,Roaring kitty is a god amongst men. He is the shining light that illuminates my path on my darkest days.

2021-05-03 22:32:28,wallstreetbets,Oh. Ok
2021-05-03 22:41:52,wallstreetbets,So you’d rather 1/ 292 million odds versus 1/10k. Got it. Makes sense.
2021-05-03 22:42:29,wallstreetbets,Friend
2021-05-03 22:45:43,wallstreetbets,Which company

2021-05-03 22:53:24,wallstreetbets,Aye lad. Aye
2021-05-03 22:54:18,wallstreetbets,If they were smart they’d get that shit finalized before nfl season. But yeah. I’m not toooo worried. Unless that ever looming collapse happens ☠️
2021-05-03 22:56:02,wallstreetbets,Did a guy who sniffs his gf’s socks just laugh at me? I’ll mark it as a new low.
2021-05-03 22:56:42,wallstreetbets,Agreed. It a nice quick slap of reality.
2021-05-03 23:00:03,wallstreetbets,That doesn’t add up.  But I appreciate your positive or negative? Attitude

2021-05-03 23:04:03,wallstreetbets,That’s it? Might lose it on purpose then. But I guess if I try that I might make money? Geeze. That’s a pickle.
2021-05-03 23:06:33,wallstreetbets,Guess I should of called the manger first.
2021-05-03 23:07:14,wallstreetbets,"I prefer CSP’s. But if it has a good run around earnings this week i will sell some

2021-05-03 23:33:58,wallstreetbets,I accumulated my money by investing it all at once. See how it creates a violent cycle? But who said this was all my money?

2021-05-03 23:57:58,wallstreetbets,Well. I invested my savings WSB style into OTM calls and swing trades. It’s a vicious circle

2021-05-04 06:33:48,wallstreetbets,The computer does it for me. I can’t count.
2021-05-04 06:34:20,wallstreetbets,But this is more fun

2021-05-04 06:56:12,wallstreetbets,I wouldn’t say spare change. Believing in the companies long term helps. And having good gains to start the year also helps.

2021-05-04 01:39:10,wallstreetbets,Did you say please?
2021-05-04 03:59:36,wallstreetbets,Say them you want to talk to the manager
2021-05-04 05:30:03,wallstreetbets,Just tell them you're a hedge fund. They'll give money back 100%

I barely struggled green today on that manipulated, NITF, spoofing nightmare that was VXRT. Son of a bitch. Same boat, different castle."

And I’m going to pour the entire amount into GME for the upcoming squeeze. I’ll buy back in to DK afterwards. It doesn’t benefit me to hold anything other than GME when the profit from the squeeze, regardless of what price it achieves, will be massive. None of these companies are going to produce results like that in the next few months, so it’s a rare YOLO for me, then back to DK."

2021-05-03 23:08:53,wallstreetbets,1000% CSP is very good but if assigned only way to cut cost is the CC. I seem them as partners. CSP+ CC. Saved me a lot.  But right now I’m not comfy on the CSP on most of the stocks I like because I’ll never see the income credits. But waiting patiently.

2021-05-03 20:13:06,wallstreetbets,Except that fantasy sports aren’t the pull anymore. The sports gambling and online casino gambling is where the big money is at.

2021-05-03 22:59:24,wallstreetbets,Just meant not on paper. It won’t actually bring my average price down. It’ll still show what it is unless I actually average down or up by buying more shares.

2021-05-03 20:32:59,wallstreetbets,"Google: Dollar Cost Average. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCqox8Mfm58&ab_channel=ChrisInvests

I am sorry if I get some of your investments wrong but the numbers dont really matter, the average does.

You put in 270000$ into TILRAY Inc and got 10000 shares, right?

Then the price dropped to 17$ per share leaving you 170000$.

For you to make your money back, TILRAY needs to go back up to 27$ from 17$. That requires TILRAY to go up 62% per share.

This is where you can DCA (Dollar Cost Average).

If you put in another 270000$ into TILRAY today, you will have 16000 new shares + 10000 old shares = 27000 shares.

To make your money back, TILRAY just needs to go back to 20$ to make your money back, **if my math is right.** Now, what is more likely to happen? TILRAY going back to 27$ or 20$? To go up to 27 from 17, it will require +62% if you don't DCA. If you do DCA now, it will need to go up only 3$ from 17$ or about 15% for you to make your money back. That is if you hold 270000 shares. Any dollar after that will be pure profit.

Now if it does go back to 27$ and you have 17000 shares, your investment will be worth 729,000$,"
2021-05-03 20:50:03,wallstreetbets,What’s a doterra
2021-05-03 20:03:36,wallstreetbets,I knew someone would get it !

2021-05-03 21:07:24,wallstreetbets,You didn’t hear about the GME squeeze? It was mentioned at least twice on this sub
2021-05-04 11:37:14,wallstreetbets,No chance unless you’re already a billionaire or close to it
2021-05-04 00:48:27,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, because an investment can be anything. Real estate, stocks, land, lumber. Anything that you can let sit and collect a reward or something that appreciates in value is an investment. So ""not"" investing being better than investing makes basically 0 sense.

Even investing in ""yourself"" as in, a business, or to better yourself, is a form of investment.

On top of that sentiment, S&P 500 has ran 40% since November. You could've literally dumped all of your money in and made 50% til now."
2021-05-03 20:12:24,wallstreetbets,I WONDER IF YOU KNOW HOW THEY LIVE IN TOKYO

2021-05-04 07:38:54,wallstreetbets,What do those do?
2021-05-03 23:10:03,wallstreetbets,Cash secured puts? You will suffer more loss if it keeps going down
2021-05-03 22:48:46,wallstreetbets,"I think July.  No way it will come back before my expiration.

You want to assume mine lol."
2021-05-03 22:50:48,wallstreetbets,I would wait.  Likely it’s a safe trade but I’m bearish in the summer so it might drop.

2021-05-04 09:31:57,wallstreetbets,I sell them to people who think the price will go down. If it does go down I buy the shares for them to borrow. If not I keep the premium.
2021-05-03 23:13:50,wallstreetbets,I believe in it in the long term.
2021-05-03 22:50:52,wallstreetbets,July is tough. There could be a pop from earnings this week from super bowl and March madness revenue. But the entire market will probably slow in summer. I’ll probably look for September and January longer dates calls. Football is king and I feel like more states will pass legislation closer to nfl season.
2021-05-03 22:53:03,wallstreetbets,Yeah probably will. There could be a push for states to legalize before the the nfl season though. Mass would be big with DraftKings headquarters. I’m sure they’ll get some type of specialized priority. Hopefully. Good luck out there. Keep your head low

Told customer exchange only for bedding as we created his profile. Kept saying “return” over me every time i said that so i just kept repeating it was only exhanges. Didnt know why we had to create a profile and i explained it was the only way the company would take an exchange. Roll my eyes internally and fully expect him back trying to return the pillows.

Low and behold he comes back gets pissed about exchange only and asks for me to delete his “membership”(wtf????). Explain to him that there’s no “delete” button for me to click but i can take his contact info off and that it was not a membership he was being charged for or sent anything for anyways. Not good enough. Dude legit asks if we’ve ever been *sued* for this while i do everything in my power not to laugh at the ridiculousness of the situation while i explain no because we neither sell information nor market to the customer unless they opt in, at this point i lowkey suspect he’s fishing for a lawsuit. Customer gets mad and huffs out.

It absolutely will explode. You can’t compare this to other companies ER. This will more than just the expected blowout earnings. Everyone knows they have a huge announcement. Either divi, big time acquisition, something. Not to mention that 500milli block that was bought at $25. This was erroneously labeled as a meme stock by media. It’s not. It’s a multi billion dollar fintech GIANT and will be recognized as such soon enough. Should have a fintech like P/E soon. With the upcoming launch of Rocket Auto they will be taking over the auto industry just as they have the mortgage industry. Not to mention the 14 other companies under the Rocket name. A true disrupter in every sense of the word. Undervalued is an understatement. See you at $55+ soon."

2021-05-04 00:55:23,wallstreetbets,"I have heard it both ways. That 90% disliked the ultimatum and went to RKT. And likewise, 90% chose to stay with UWMC because they were better for x reason.

I feel it is more likely that it hurt UWMC, since by not staying with UWMC they have more choices."
2021-05-04 01:03:36,wallstreetbets,"I’m in the industry. Literally don’t know a single broker personally that went with Rocket. Not all are happy about the decision, but it was a clear choice who to choose. Rocket actively works against brokers best interests and is just generally a terrible lender to begin with. I would not be surprised if Rocket entirely shut down their wholesale division within the next year unless the UWM ultimatum gets tossed out.

In 2020 UWM did almost DOUBLE the volume of Rocket Wholesale and that’s before the ultimatum. Rockets Wholesale division is honestly on its last legs. They’ll likely pivot their focus to their retail division and the new rumored RKT auto loans because they’re losing the fight against UWM."
2021-05-04 01:21:42,wallstreetbets,"Auto and personal loans aren't rumor. They reported earnings from them last quarter.

The earnings from wholesale seem to be fairly small. Would definitely free up resources for retail, auto, and personal. 

Seems like a win either way for RKT."
2021-05-04 01:27:20,wallstreetbets,"Rocket Wholesale contributed about a third of Rockets overall volume

If even only half of all brokers chose UWM, that’s likely going to cause a pretty big hit to their volume this year. Further stressed by the fact that rates are rising and RKT retail is mostly refi focused...I’ll just say they better hope the auto and personal loan divisions pull some weight. At least they’ll be able to reallocate staff and resources to those divisions though instead of just laying them off like most other mortgage companies will have to do."
2021-05-04 01:30:36,wallstreetbets,"Refi volume should continue to be strong, as a lot of people are finding it hard to move homes due to low supply. Cash out and pay off debt or do some remodeling."
2021-05-04 01:38:56,wallstreetbets,"It’s still strong now as rates dipped. When they were up about a half point not too long ago there was a pretty immediate drop in refinance applications. As much as my paychecks would love for refinances to last all year, it’s pretty unlikely. Instead we’ll eventually hit the usual cycle of rising rates, industry layoffs, M&As of mortgage companies, etc.

Rockets strength has always been portfolio retention. When a Rocket mortgage refinances, they end up at Rocket again for that refi. But as rates rise, that portfolio moves from a revenue source to an asset. How that ends up balancing out will determine their year.

I think if they want to succeed this year they really need to build a better reputation as a lender. If you’re buying a home you just straight up won’t get an offer accepted if your preapproval shows Rocket Mortgage."

Price tanks

8 days ago they announce that they did sell shares. The company had no debt any longer and has raised ~550m in capital

Price rises.

2021-05-04 07:32:28,wallstreetbets,"Yep. I just placed a limit order this morning for market open to  take my  10% AMD position to 12.5%. As always, they had an absolutely gargantuan report  last week and then proceeded to give back every gain of the last couple months.  Great chance to pick up more.  


I""m also using this time to add a lot of NVDA, which is now 10% of my portfolio. It has dropped a bit with the rest of the sector over the past few sessions and their earnings is in a few weeks.   


My only regret right now is that  I'd love to pick up INTC for their inevitable return (even if just for awhile), but I feel 56-65 is hugely overpriced. I'd start to have interest at 50 and I'd smash that buy button at 45 in a heartbeat. The other regret is that I don't really want  TSM, but would much rather have the Hillsboro Oregon based LSCC. I was telling everyone to pick them up a few weeks ago when they were around $34, because they're a great company on their own and seem like they'd be an inevitable target for a company looking to make an acquisition in the next few years. I didn't have the cash flow at the time, though, so I missed out.. and in just those few weeks, they've shot up  to $56. AMD/NVDA/INTC/LSCC would make a pretty strong bundle.  


Anyway, yeah... AMD is like AMZN, GOOG, MSFT, AAPL, NVDA for me. Companies I don't just plan to hold long, but that I just don't plan to ever sell unless I'm desperate for money."

They'll rotate back in and those of us already sitting on plenty of growth tech stocks will just see things rise to a new high plateau again before the  next cycle.

At least, that's my uneducated view of things. My whole portfolio is large cap tech growth stocks -- especially if you count PLTR and TSLA in that, too. As long as you got time, things will come back around. In the meantime, I'd see it as a chance to get great deals that the market is too stupid to react to. I mean, imagine being able to buy a lottery ticket after the lotto numbers have already been announced...  


I took AMD from 10% to 12.5% of my portfolio on this today and the only reason I didn't advance my AMD position even more is that I took this chane to double down on  AMZN (from 10-25% of my portfolio) and NVIDIA (from 5 to  10%)."

2021-05-04 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"HIG quick adderall DD HARTFORD FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP INC

This stock has recently jumped from $54 to $68 in April, and I am expecting a similar play. 

The MACD oscillator has been bullish since the start of this year. 

- Price target of $76-$93. (I am personally aiming for $85-93)

- The charts have demonstrated a good ability for further gains. 

- Two buyout offers which valued the company at nearly $25 billion were rejected. 

- Insurance companies are currently benefiting from the pandemic, as most lines of business have a lower amount of overall claims being filed. 

- The insurance industry is currently increasing premiums and re-evaluating underwriting standards in order to limit losses. 

- HIG's mutual fund business grew as a result of the rebound in the market following the CARES stimulus package. 

As mentioned the insurance industry is generally benefiting from the pandemic. As many people are staying at home people are naturally doing less driving, and therefore have a lower chance of getting into an accident. This has resulted in better combined ratio's for HIG's auto insurance unit. 

Workers compensation claims have also been lower than pre-pandemic, as less people are present in the workplace hence natrually there will be lower claims. Conversely with businesses re-opening, we can expect new insurance policies being taken out with HIG. 

As travellers insurance is also genreally rising in rates. With lockdown easing and vaccination rates, travel is expected to increase. I expect this to be a positive impact on the traveler's insurance unit of HIG. 

Overall:

The recent large spike has reflected HIG's high quality and growth prospects into the current valuation, and with the new policies being taken out with the pandemic easing and the companies good adjustment to the pandemic itself, I expect another rise in share price."
2021-05-04 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Why I’m bullish on MVIS So, let me get this straight. We criticized MVIS for having a “large” 2b market cap and so now we all suddenly support Nokia with a market cap of 25.1b? That’s 12x more than MVIS. 

NOK Income statement for year ended 2020:

Ratio of cost of revenue to total revenue: 13,659,000/21,852,000 = 62.5%. This means 62.5% of all revenue made was for covering costs, while the remaining 37.5% is what the company kept as gross profit. 

MVIS income statement for year ended 2020:

Ratio of cost of revenue to total revenue: 
1,398/3090 = 45.24%. This means 45.24% of all revenue made was for covering costs, while the remaining 54.76% is what the company kept as gross profit.

All prices listed from income statements are in millions of dollars. Yes Nokia is bringing home more money, but they aren’t raking it in as efficiently as MVIS. Because MVIS is a much much smaller company than NOK, their differences in the dollar amount of gross profit is to be understood. But my original statement still stands, MVIS is “taking home a bigger % of their pie” for profits, because they are better than NOK at mitigating losses and covering for overhead costs. 

Let’s take a look at their D./T.A. Ratio. This will give us insight to which degree debt is used to finance assets for each company. The lower the ratio, the better the company is at using that debt to finance assets.

NOK DTA: 6,486,000/36,191,000 = 17.92%. This means, in laymen’s terms, that for every $100 of assets, NOK accumulated $17.92 in debt. 

MVIS DTA: 3,107/21,006 = 14.79% This means, in laymen’s terms, that for every $100 of assets, MVIS accumulated $14.79 in debt. 

MVIS does a much better job, as previously stated, at mitigating losses and staying efficient. Not to mention, because MVIS is researching extremely new technology, much of their funding will be for R&D - much more R&D is needed for sensors that didn’t exist a few years ago, over the R&D needed for a new phone or cellular service which has already been around for decades. If MVIS is able to have a lower DTA ratio, developing “new to this world” technology, than a company that has been making phones longer than we’ve been alive, then how is it a bad buy? How is NOK a better buy?

I know typically DDs are not suppose to take into account the comparison between other stocks, but too many of you have fallen into this NOK train that will leave you at a $4.50+ cost basis, and suddenly NOK will start trading sideways at $4.10 for the next coming years, and you’re nah holding. Have fun making 3 cents a share per year. That’s pussy shit I didn’t come here for. 

Not financial advice, I literally failed Finance 304. Professor was an ass.

EDIT: Anyone peep MVIS today? Hahaha damn... definitely doesn’t coincide with some of the “$5 best valuation” comments circling around. 

Anyways thanks for the comments, I’ve learned a lot. Many of you are seriously smart and talented people. Thank you for your input and I wish you all the best!"

2021-05-04 00:21:55,wallstreetbets,"And I thought that many of you were looking to kill the short sellers and get them to cover, but many with paper hands just gave up. It will be a buyout regardless of whether you help or not. I’m definitely buying more shares daily. So far this stock is holding up much better then it did before. It went up from 11, 14,17, 24, 26 and 29 after hours. So now it’s trading between 13+ , 15+ which is pretty good, considering every single one of you people sold it, because you just got scared of the short sellers. Now it’s so much harder to apply the squeeze because they now have a room to wiggle. Good luck to all longs."

2021-05-04 10:14:53,wallstreetbets,"Lidar is dead, dude"
2021-05-03 22:11:51,wallstreetbets,"First off, Nokia and MVIS are in different industries, at different life cycle stages and have wildly different sizes (<500k in revenue last quarter vs. $6 billion in revenue last quarter). Gross profit margins mean nothing unless you’re comparing companies in the same peer group. Second, MVIS has ceased all its former manufacturing as of last year and literally is just licensing their patents to a single customer. They did this back in March 2020, so most of their revenue in 2020 came from licensing, which has little if any cost of sales expenses. If you look at the gross profit margin from the years it was actually manufacturing, it wasn’t good... gross profit margin was (including licensing revenue) only 4.7% for the 3 months ended 3/31/2020 and 3.6% for the year ended 12/31/2019. Gross margin for product revenue alone was negative.

These are frankly terrible numbers for a manufacturing company. In cost of sales alone, MVIS was incurring a loss by selling their products. It’s no wonder they started licensing their product to their (sole) customer because they were running a loss by manufacturing themselves."

But YE 2020 gross profit figures are misleading because they stopped manufacturing in March 2020 and solely made money off of licensing after that. Most of their revenue in YE 2020 was licensing which inflated their gross profit margin.

In full years when they manufactured, the gross profit margin was really tight, and if you take away the licensing revenue, it was in the negatives, so they were manufacturing *at a loss* before they even got to SG&A expenses. This DD is completely wrong. MVIS’s manufacturing efficiency was terrible."

2021-05-03 21:03:32,wallstreetbets,"You're welcome, and learning is always good. Your intuition about the profit margin was correct, it is impressive to see >50% gross profit. People are still hyped up about TSLA, and it has around a 21% gross profit ($7,611m gross profit over $35,940m revenue). The problem for MVIS comes elsewhere, when thinking about what MVIS might have in the future and what's already priced in the market.

I wouldn't hold MVIS, I don't think it's good for either a slow appreciation or in case of a sudden rise to massively higher value, but it undeniably has a lot of attention and volatility at the moment, and that presents plenty of opportunities."

2021-05-04 09:29:09,wallstreetbets,"It’s a strategy to make your money back or even profit depending on how much the ticker has dipped. I’ve been in MVIS since mid-January and I’ve always sold when I make a profit and then buy back in at a lower price. A few times I haven’t timed it well and I’ve sold, at a loss, at a higher price and then picked up more shares at a lower price. There are some tax implications with this, look up “wash sale”."

2021-05-04 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Meredith Corporation (MDP) Selling Local Media Group to Gray Television (GTN) for $2,7B Hi WSB! 

I'm back with another MDP update, my original post about the company is here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lsuxmw/meredith\_corporation\_mdp/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lsuxmw/meredith_corporation_mdp/)

&#x200B;

So, news came out today that $GTN is buying $MDP Local Media Group for 2,7B$. This is huge for MDP shareholders who will receive 14,5$ per share as cash and 1 for 1 new shares for new MDP spin off for National Media Group. For more information [https://ir.meredith.com/events-and-presentations/event-details/2021/Meredith-Corporation-Conference-Call/default.aspx](https://ir.meredith.com/events-and-presentations/event-details/2021/Meredith-Corporation-Conference-Call/default.aspx)

&#x200B;

This Deal practically wipes out MDP debt and gives existing shareholders a one time 14,5$ dividend.

The National media group that will remain under the sticker MDP will have around 2B annual revenue and will make around 300m EBITDA (Closer look at FCF reveals that this 300m is very close to the FCF also), for a company that only has 45m shares outstanding this is absolutely huge. 

We can look at it like this 300/45 = 6,6$ per share annualized cash flow trading at around 33$ as we speak. On top of this there will be a one time compensation of 14,5$ per share giving it a yield of 44% That is insane, this is practically a steal right now.

To me, the fuck up is coming out with a new version practically every year.  Maybe it helps them sell to these trendy assholes who can’t stand to have a lower number.  I buy when there’s a massive improvement.  I bought the the 5 and now the 9.  The image stabilization made me buy it and it’s worth it for what I use it for.

2021-05-04 08:43:13,wallstreetbets,"I don’t know for sure but I have 2 guesses: 
1. People are buying houses in rural areas that currently live in high cost of living areas to take advantage of low interest rates (a 200k house with 10k down is approx 1150$/month which isn’t a lot of money for someone making 125k+ per year. I’m not in that category, but maybe someday?). And people in those rural areas are taking advantage of the inventory shortage and selling their house for 2-3x what they may have paid previously. 

2. People are relocating and buying houses and investment/rental properties because of COVID, lots of companies are shifting to full time/permanent teleworking environments. 

Again, I haven’t done any deep research, but those are my two guesses."

2021-05-04 01:18:37,wallstreetbets,Any ideas why big money hates the stock?
2021-05-04 08:44:36,wallstreetbets,Ahhh that Dildo. Recent downgrade w/ sub $10 price & reporting earnings this week. No 🎲 & go 🎣
2021-05-03 20:22:37,wallstreetbets,"Q1, yes.  

Most brokers stopped using them about a month ago when UWM’s CEO, Mat Ishbia, started penalizing brokers for using RKT.  Over 80% (I believe) of mortgage brokers signed an agreement with UWM to stop doing business with RKT."

2021-05-03 22:28:30,wallstreetbets,"Houses are too expensive right now, I would say ridiculously expensive imo. People that were planning on selling their house and moving but didn't because of covid, with everyone getting vaxxed you're going to see a lot of houses for sale, on top of whomever gets foreclosed. The housing market will correct it's self due to the extra supply and that's when RKT and companies like it will start to soar."

2021-05-03 21:14:13,wallstreetbets,The real DD is in the comments.
2021-05-03 22:57:37,wallstreetbets,"Being angry at a person or company for what they did in the past and then missing an opportunity for what they're doing in the present because of it, only hurts the investor. If someone lost money with NKLA I can understand the frustration.

The fact is there is a company, it employs a few hundred professionals, some of which are very capable, and it is already developing prototypes for both electric and hydrogen trucks (yes, that work uphill as well...).

Because of all the mistakes, stupidity, misbehavior and terrible managing from the past, people lost confidence in it, it lost value and now in the realm of EV companies, it's undervalued. I don't think this is a complicated equation at all.

Again, not saying one should put loads of money into it, but, can it be an interesting addition to a portfolio? I think so, and no one is paying me to write this."
2021-05-03 23:01:31,wallstreetbets,"What's a true ape? What does that even mean? Someone on a mission to fight the establishment? Someone who agrees with everyone in this subreddit? Someone who buys into companies cause they're in vogue here? 

What I wrote makes sense. It might not turn out that way, but then again, that can be said about any D/D here. 

I'm not trying to be an ape. That's a silly proposition. I just want to invest correctly and make a reasonable profit over time."
2021-05-03 20:23:05,wallstreetbets,"Renewables will not compensate for demand for electric vehicle charging. Renewables take years just to make the energy it took to create them. He'll, a recent survey showed that 1 in 5 electric vehicle purchasers has gone back to gas because of the inconvenience of the vehicles. Nikola is not the answer though - put owner here"
2021-05-03 21:13:16,wallstreetbets,"You're right, this is a great opportunity. To lose money."
2021-05-04 01:28:09,wallstreetbets,"1) I'm not angry.  
2) I never had anything to do with Nikola. Never invested in it.

2021-05-04 19:18:28,wallstreetbets,Oh look... tech drops 1-2% and NOK drops FIVE FUCKING PERCENT. Get ready for many many more days like this. NOK always goes up less and down more than the broader market.

2021-05-03 23:52:31,wallstreetbets,NOK is #1 in 5G patents. Do I smell a buyout happening in the near future?
2021-05-04 02:10:32,wallstreetbets,"Ericsson’s sitting below $14. If we adjust the price such that shares outstanding are equal, then NOK sits at $8.299. The fact that they’re closing contracts left and right tells me that they are highly undervalued in comparison to their rival."
2021-05-04 02:02:16,wallstreetbets,"This is the thing people don’t see. Nokia’s thing is end-to-end networking. This means they make everything from the antennas to the networking hardware needed to connect to the internet.

Not only will they be making business with companies like Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile, but also companies like Spectrum and other ISPs. I wouldn’t be surprised to find out that SpaceX’s internet service (Starlink) works with them, too.

Ofc, partnerships with the main cloud providers has already initiated, too."

sold it at 10 and felt relieved, only for it to moon all the way to 50."

2021-05-04 05:08:41,wallstreetbets,This is what the hedge funds are doing now. They are tanking all the stocks so people will sell off when they break even after holding and then FOMO back in.

2021-05-03 20:20:48,wallstreetbets,"RKT absolutely will explode. You can’t compare this to other companies ER. This will more than just the expected blowout earnings. Everyone knows they have a huge announcement. Either divi, big time acquisition, something. Not to mention that 500milli block that was bought at $25. This was erroneously labeled as a meme stock by media. It’s not. It’s a multi billion dollar fintech GIANT and will be recognized as such soon enough. Should have a fintech like P/E soon. With the upcoming launch of Rocket Auto they will be taking over the auto industry just as they have the mortgage industry. Not to mention the 14 other companies under the Rocket name. A true disrupter in every sense of the word. Undervalued is an understatement. See you at $55+ soon."
2021-05-03 23:50:06,wallstreetbets,So many of us are holding bags up to $40+.  Do you think we’ll hit this after ER?  I am lucky with b/e under $28 and will hold given opportunity costs of other names but great prospects with RKT.
2021-05-04 00:46:40,wallstreetbets,"The housing crunch is a combination of 7-10 years of very little new construction and millennials getting married, having kids and moving to the burbs. Boise and Colorado Springs, where I live, are a product of lifestyle moves by people of all ages. This started a few years ago with remote work becoming a thing. Covid accelerated that trend exponentially. The one caution to this story is a 1% increase in mortgage rates equals a 10% reduction in buying power. Interest rates will dictate how long RKt continues this ride."
2021-05-04 03:22:13,wallstreetbets,"So ape terms, buy as soon as the market opens tomorrow and sell on the 5th?"

2021-05-04 09:04:35,wallstreetbets,"Your thesis about the housing market is correct. Here in Texas for the past several months, houses are bid up and bought in cash 20-30% above market price. Interest rates, while not at an all-time low, are still very low compared to historical averages. Many of my peers, ages 20-30, are actively seeking to buy a house. To make things crazier, some builders are beginning to float housing prices, and people are still lining up out the door to get their name on a waitlist."

2021-05-03 21:13:51,wallstreetbets,Sure is alot of rkt dd....fishy
2021-05-03 20:33:39,wallstreetbets,"RKT absolutely will explode. You can’t compare this to other companies ER. This will more than just the expected blowout earnings. Everyone knows they have a huge announcement. Either divi, big time acquisition, something. Not to mention that 500milli block that was bought at $25. This was erroneously labeled as a meme stock by media. It’s not. It’s a multi billion dollar fintech GIANT and will be recognized as such soon enough. Should have a fintech like P/E soon. With the upcoming launch of Rocket Auto they will be taking over the auto industry just as they have the mortgage industry. Not to mention the 14 other companies under the Rocket name. A true disrupter in every sense of the word. Undervalued is an understatement. See you at $55+ soon."
2021-05-04 00:18:48,wallstreetbets,It's in the name. Only a fool wouldn't see this coming.

2021-05-03 22:15:49,wallstreetbets,Yes. 3 hail marys and 300 rkt shares long to forgive your retarded sins.
2021-05-04 13:13:02,wallstreetbets,I live in Reno and my house went up 33% last year. +1 on climate
2021-05-03 20:17:37,wallstreetbets,"Same thing happening in Arizona, Nevada, Utah, etc. I bought my house several years ago and it was a big problem having to compete with cash offers then. From what I've heard it has only gotten worse."
2021-05-03 21:50:58,wallstreetbets,Idaho isn't the only place. It's happening in nearly every mortage market.. basically in every single non-major metropolitan area. Even really sorta big cities like Nashville are red hot.
2021-05-03 20:25:57,wallstreetbets,"Yes. Middle age, older real estate investors, and seasoned house flippers are snagging properties to sell to the millenials creating zeh bubble [beer fest]."
2021-05-03 22:42:12,wallstreetbets,"At today’s rates, a lot of buyers are paying cash and then doing a cash-out refi."
2021-05-03 23:23:33,wallstreetbets,"I’m here in AZ and we getting a lot of California ppl too. They pay cash for the house in order to make their offer more attractive, but once they have the house, a bunch of them refinance to get the cash out because rate are so low."
2021-05-04 05:09:44,wallstreetbets,This. Most of the current trends in housing are largely due to mass exodus of California and New York into smaller more affordable metropolitan cities.
2021-05-04 13:14:05,wallstreetbets,Same in Reno
2021-05-03 21:20:11,wallstreetbets,"Chinese money came to California and did that to us. No way first time home buyers could even put an offer in on a house when foreign money was coming in all cash, 15% over ask and buying up everything. Sorry the fall out has come your way. At least hopefully the Californians will take care of what they buy there and just not let compete towns go to shit. Foreign money never up keeps anything up and lets it all turn into derelict China Towns. Not sure why the hell they do this."
2021-05-04 07:30:26,wallstreetbets,"Once covid started, Californian's realized how shit their state was, and started running for the door as soon as papa musk and Joe Rogan left"

2021-05-04 01:01:30,wallstreetbets,"Jefferies values RKT at 13x earnings because of expected market share gains whereas the mortgage industry average is 7x earnings

RKT can only achieve those market share gains because they are a technology company so SA may have accidentally been partly right"
2021-05-04 17:04:37,wallstreetbets,"RKT is definitely a fintech ticker more than just a finance ticker and that sentiment is gaining traction with analysts.

RKT is more than just Quicken Loans.

2021-05-04 17:07:42,wallstreetbets,It's because earnings are tomorrow and there for there are plays to be made.
2021-05-04 01:03:00,wallstreetbets,"Yep. I am trying to move to Utah.  Best of the best powder skiing, best astronomy, great climate, dry camping, best collection of national parks and other scenery. Dinosaur tracks, petroglyphs, probably some yet to be discovered. They even have a lake called the Caribbean of the Rockies (though I assume it never gets warm) on the border with Idaho.

Also only a day drive from the Pacific coast and all of the surrounding states are packed with interesting terrain. Meteor Crater.  The Wave. Antelope Canyon. Grand Canyon. Shiprock. Craters of The Moon. Black Canyon of the Gunnison. Dinosaur National Monument. Hell's Canyon. Great Basin. Yellowstone/Tetons. It's a geological wonderland for hundreds of miles in every direction from SLC. If you're a science nerd it's heaven.

There are at least a dozen week long road trips you could take going in almost every direction out of the state and see different awesome stuff on each trip."

2021-05-04 13:16:59,wallstreetbets,It's true. I live in Reno and for a year now Cali plates have been everywhere. We'd go up to Tahoe and the NV side was nothing but a Cali plates trying to just do something.

2021-05-03 20:19:04,wallstreetbets,I know you were kind of joking but I actually think that might be the case. The people moving to California seem to be a lot younger. How the hell they can afford it I have no idea.

2021-05-04 00:50:52,wallstreetbets,"A reverse split is the exact opposite of what you would want to do in this situation. It's a bearish signal to the market & artificially inflates the stock price. This is typically done by a company's management to avoid being delisted from the major exchanges & is normally met by a selloff from investors once this is announced/put into motion. It's really an ill-advised action on behalf of a company's Board of Directors & should be used as an absolute last resort, if utilized at all. Conversely, a stock buyback is a bullish signal to investors which typically indicates that the stock is undervalued & will increase the shareholder's percentage of stock ownership, as well as give a boost to the market value of the stock once this action is completed. Investors typically buy more shares upon this type of announcement. In the case of Nokia, the proxy voting proposal for a buyback of a maximum of 550 million shares was approved at the annual meeting on April 8th. This will allow the board to repurchase shares up to the allotted amount until 10/7/22..."

Never said this one factoid would be. It's the whole package that makes it worth it. This factoid was just to show you, successfully, that you dont know what the fuck you're talking about. You are raging against a company that hasn't existed since mid 2018. 


>on all next-gen Xbox consoles sold through GameStop

exactly. And where are people buying their consoles? In person, maybe at a trusted shop where they can nerd out about games? Or do they prefer online, and want the guaranteed lowest price (gme is price matching) and would like to have it delivered one hour to their front door (partnership with door dash)? Either way the answer *will* be gamestop.

This is what I'm saying: you are bearish on a company that does not even exist anymore. Right now, gme should be valued on fundamentals at around 30 billion. and in two years time, when the digital transformation is done, GME will be valued between 50 and 70 billion, and it will be an absolute powerhouse. They might even buy valve, once obese gabe had his heart attack."

Now these same options may possibly be cheaper closer to above stated date if the ETF continues higher or if the ETF trades sideways for a while.

Either way the issue now is there is too much of the float sloshing around out there looking for a home. It's not some devious market maker, it is VIAC themselves who increased the float creating a much bigger selloff than expected, and thus a much bigger surplus, and that slack has not been picked up yet. And so it it is VIAC who needs to bring out their best song and dance come Thursday to dig itself/us out of this tsunami of shares slamming us on the shore relentlessly.

2021-05-03 21:59:57,wallstreetbets,"I agree.  Paramount has been trying to monetize their content through steaming now since streaming really came about and they've failed.  And they've failed for the reasons I outlined in another response.  Their DRM (Digital Rights Management) is (was) pure draconian and people would quickly find themselves without a device that could play the content.  (i.e. Go to Big Box Store, pick up MediaStreamBox/DVD/Bluray player, it works for 2 weeks then it becomes non-compliant.)

What people don't realize is the absolute nightmare streaming services endure at the hands of content providers with DRM.  Which is why we're seeing a trend toward the content providers themselves streaming the content.

As DRM becomes more sophisticated and more platforms support it, content has become much more accessible for everyday users without the hassle of trying to fumble their way through a DRM compliance issue.

It used to really be just Flash Player on a computer that could handle the DRM, and a lot of people ended up on the wrong side of that as Flash Player is so clunky it couldn't really handle the graphics quality demand a good stream would provide.

I've been in this fight since 2009 trying to get Netflix to work via Linux.  Linux communities consistently said they'd be generally happy to pay for content.  But what was happening was providers were asking for subscription fees, AND THEN, dictating what devices you could stream their content on, trying to double dip by getting licensing fees from device manufactures and streamers and subscription fees from the consumers themselves.

So, we'll see.  Viacom has a shit ton of content.  Disney and HBO have shown that if you have a shit ton of content, people will pay for it.  So, there's hope for Viacom.

But, to your point, if you have a premium service, it had better look, feel and operate like a premium service.  Viacom, and specifically Paramount have some work to do in that area.

(EDIT 1)  Just signed up for Paramount+.  You are correct.  Total trash.  Much of the content was OTA content alongside ancient ass Comedy Central and Nick stuff.

I don't know.  Definitely looks like they're fucking this up.

As I look at it, what they need is a free, commercials based service that provides all their OTA content, while offering a fee-based subscription for their cable channels.

I see the question asked a lot why we can't have a la carte channel selection through our cable providers.  The streaming services have a chance to dig into that market and Viacom is WELL positioned to offer just that.

Fuck.  I was excited, but more hesitant now.  That was disappointing.  Going to go cancel that subscription before they charge me $5.99.

(EDIT 2)  The movie selection is pretty damn old.  I'm 50 and if I haven't seen those by now, it's probably because I don't want to.  And the ones I do like I've seen enough that I probably won't miss them.  Oh no, I won't be able to watch Raiders of the Lost Ark for a 100th time.  I'll be stuck at 99 indefinitely unless I pay $5.99 a month.  

There's probably a market for it, but nothing like Disney and HBO which are two premium content creators as well as providers.  

This is looking less and less appealing unless Viacom can get us access to more recent content."
2021-05-04 09:10:28,wallstreetbets,"> This is looking less and less appealing unless Viacom can get us access to more recent content.

That is my thought. Like I said, I'm long the stock again under 40, but no way would I be a buyer at any price above 50. Absolutely no way. The monthly pay streaming model can generate a massive amount of revenue and marginal profits once initial are recouped can be huge because the cost of fulfillment is basically $0 so I am optimistic about the market space in general, but VIAC seems to be way behind on a competitive offering, which is why I think the stock is highly speculative."

2021-05-03 23:39:15,wallstreetbets,"You are correct. OCGN only has a deal to do US sales for Covaxin. But since Bharat Biotech is a private company, the only publicly traded company representing the Covaxin stake is OCGN. OP listed companies, not vaccine names per se. At the very least Covaxin should be on the list for efficacy. OCGN is a proxy beneficiary so as a sympathy/related play it is relevant. Furthermore, just because a company represents the commercial side of a vaccine doesn’t mean it’s not worth trading. For example, BNTX made the vaccine but PFE partnered with cost sharing and did the distribution. But we call it the PFE vaccine and most people trade PFE. OCGN has lower rev potential than NVAX because smaller addressable market but for a small biotech that $ is huge."

Really sounds like an exciting company to be invested in, in a market 1/10 the size of the USA. Not to mention PE ratios of Canadian LPs are closer to 20 while US companies are still trading closer to 6-8PE. Also not sure if you looked at Robinhood’s top owned stocks but ACB, Tilray and APHA have been up there for a long long time, while US companies haven’t even been up listed yet... so you’re absolutely disillusioned in thinking that people are more knowledgeable about US companies in the US."

2021-05-04 02:59:40,wallstreetbets,"Not sure how this is a bubble which is a speculative frenzy of buying. Real estate is a good investment and hedge against inflation. Rates are still low so people can just borrow to buy houses. Low rates and whatever is having people leave cities is driving demand. There’s just more demand than supply. Seems basic to me.

I see two things happening. If inflation isn’t transitory and rates go up, the inflation will eat at the debt of those home owners and the increased rates will reduce demand. Or people will just start building using 3D printing tech rather than traditional and currently very expensive materials. That will circumvent materials costs and the supply shortage.

Edit: 3rd option is foreclosures increase supply once forbearance ends."

Shortages, not money printing per se, is what creates inflation. So these house prices are not in a bubble, they’re just inflated bc there’s too many people/dollars chasing after too few goods.

2021-05-03 20:02:25,wallstreetbets,"I dont have to believe you, I've had actual past experience. Almost ten years ago I sold my old iPhone 4 and got a MS Nokia Windows Phone and fell in love with it. I bought the stock around $3. Rode it to $6 for a nice 2x return. I believed they would come back with a strong Microsoft partnership plus the telecom technology/cell tower tech they were trying to sell and install around the world. Well we all know how MS Windows phones turned out. Nokia stock dropped back to $4 and all investors talked about back then (2012?) was how it was beaten down but worth so much more and they were going to make so much money on patents, stock buybacks, and China and European telecom 4G tech. Never happened. They lost contract after contract to Ericsson and unfairly subsidized Chinese telecoms among others. Everything you spout is an exact copy of everything I heard almost a decade ago and again, you can see the chart yourself. Its one thing to hear all this a first time and think maybe you're onto something here but when you seen this movie play out before and actually have a trackrecord to look back on how it actually panned out? Yeah, sorry man, NOK is a dead horse until they actually make a complete paradigm shift in what they're doing."

The housing market in the US is absolutely bonkers because of land use regulations. Have you ever looked zoning maps in the US:

[https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2019/05/22/single-family-zoning/assets/images/portland-topper-320\_x2.png](https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2019/05/22/single-family-zoning/assets/images/portland-topper-320_x2.png)

The pink is single family zoning. Large lots, one family only. This type of land use will never produce enough supply to meet demand."
2021-05-03 22:58:41,wallstreetbets,">CEOs are very very good for estimating their costs for the upcoming quarters.  We don’t look to them on how to fix the situation.

Sure, my point is that actual economic research does not support that inflation will become problematic. That is a stronger argument than ""CEOs are talking about inflation.""

>Austrian hasn’t been disproven, generally because they don’t make ultra specific predictions.  

 I said Austrian's contributions to monetary policy had been disproven, which they mostly have been. Austrian economics in general hasn't been disproven, but rather discarded. Although useful in it's time and retains some useful general truths, Austrian Economics has become too much of an ideology to produce any research that can be interpreted in a non-ideological context. For example, the sometimes explicit rejection of empiricism is just completely unserious at times.

>Kensyianism has been falsified however, so we should turn to the Chicago school who clearly are concerned about inflation. 

 Keynesianism hasn't been ""falsified,"" that's just a ludicrous statement. Janet Yellen, former Fed chair and current Treasury secretary is a Keynesian, as are plenty of other academic and policy macroeconomics. This just reads like someone who got their education in the history of economic thought from social media.

>You should also look at the bond markets and to see what the markets say about inflation.

The bond market is pricing in inflation that is going to be the highest since...2013. That's entirely ok, we've been undershoting our 2% target since the recession and need to pull it up. There will be modest inflation to bring us back up the the long term average, but certainly not enough to drive runaway inflation as OP suggests."

Even just ""throwing away"" some lottery tickets on puts when a huge bubble pop is (probably) pending can stand to make you a shitload of money. Unless you're trying to retire in three years or something, putting all your money on the sidelines is for chumps."
2021-05-03 20:38:25,wallstreetbets,Am I missing some basic logic here? How would inflation ever be a godsend for anybody who's not already so flush that it's just a drop in the bucket for them? Or did you just forget the /s?
2021-05-04 02:20:47,wallstreetbets,I did not say I put all my money on the sidelines lol
2021-05-04 15:43:32,wallstreetbets,That's inflation. Inflation is things getting more expensive. Stock are things.
2021-05-04 15:57:31,wallstreetbets,No it’s not. Inflation is a reduction in buying power of money expressed in terms of a relatively constant basket of necessities.
2021-05-04 12:15:06,wallstreetbets,Your foolproof theory about moronstonk and vix correlating seems to be a bit... retarded

2021-05-04 12:45:56,wallstreetbets,i know u can't read but i didn't realise u were blind also
2021-05-04 19:39:51,wallstreetbets,"No it’s not lol inflation is defined as the reduction in buying power of the currency against the CPI basket. Your stocks get you more CPI baskets now than before therefore it’s not inflation. It’s only inflation if the stock price went up and the amount you could buy when you sold them did not go up, or went down.

You’re talking about number go up 😂 that’s an increase in welfare so long as inflation did not go up commensurately. It did not. It’s not inflation. It’s a return on investment.

Stocks are not in the CPI basket. Therefore they do not affect inflation. Google it 😂"

After the conference today when they show the scientific world what they have, a pill for covid their shares will increase at very min 30%.  If you wana day trade this bad boy or hold out for tendies in the near future is your choice but theres lots of $ to be made here.  We need to hit them hard right now while the price is very reasonable, shake the rest of the shorts out and watch the rocket launch.  Buy now.  Buy now.  Buy now.

It absolutely will explode. You can’t compare this to other companies ER. This will more than just the expected blowout earnings. Everyone knows they have a huge announcement. Either divi, big time acquisition, something. Not to mention that 500milli block that was bought at $25. This was erroneously labeled as a meme stock by media. It’s not. It’s a multi billion dollar fintech GIANT and will be recognized as such soon enough. Should have a fintech like P/E soon. With the upcoming launch of Rocket Auto they will be taking over the auto industry just as they have the mortgage industry. Not to mention the 14 other companies under the Rocket name.

2021-05-04 10:17:46,wallstreetbets,"Thanks! I was looking at some mining penny stock and saw they had a small tin mine, so I started to research tin and ended up down in this rabbit hole.

I own some on fidelity...  are you trying to buy with your 401k brokerage link? I couldn't buy with 401k money, but my regular account has access to it.

Also, went through 10 pages of tin news on Google and found an article that says a major smelter in Indonesia won't be up to full capacity for 9 more months and has been stock piling casserite(tin ore) the whole time. They are also having issues with old machinery breaking.

 Looking at how bad covid is india, I can see all these smelters in 3rd world countries running at low capacities for a while. 

Alphamin resources uses a smelter in Uganda.  Hopefully they don't give a fuck about covid in drc and Uganda.  They got other serious issues to deal with.

Also, these Australian tin miners are still using 19k/ton as guidance for building a new mine for feasibility. They were confident where tin prices are going.

Wrong. If the GME squeeze hadn't been fucked with by stopping buying, all the guys who got rich as fuck on GME would have continued pilling into SLV.

2021-05-04 09:04:23,wallstreetbets,$65 calls on a stock that was like $3 a year ago?
2021-05-04 07:29:59,wallstreetbets,"Sure, so the pipeline Mark to Market is made up of 2 parts. The locked/unfunded open pipeline and the LHFS. They have to mark a value for these populations at the end of every month, and then back out the prior months valuation. Margins are down substantially and new locks are starting to taper off as well. Numbers just for simplicity, not theirs: So if Q1 they had 100mm open pipeline and 150bps margin then it was worth $1.5m, and now margins are 50bps and locks have dropped so the pipeline is now 75mm the open is worth $375k. End of the month they take a $1.125mm FV write down on the MTM. Except UWMs pipeline is probably like $60-70B. Even if the pipeline stayed the same and margins only dropped 50bps (which they’ve dropped much more) you’re looking at $300mm+ write down. I don’t claim to know what their pipeline and margins are but I compete with them daily and know where my margins are and we’ve moved from over 200bps last year to now about 35bps and there’s lenders with still better price than me."

This is one of the under the radar companies with little daily volume that institutions own a high percentage of, they have plenty of cash on the books and although they aren't turning profits yet, has a ton of upside potential. Insuretechs are soon to be the new way. Alex Timm has a longtime experience in the insurance industry, his Father was very heavy within Nationwide, obviously he knows the ropes. They have gained a very heavy customer base in the last quarter. Earnings are in 2 days Wednesday A.H., my guess is they will blow the expectations out the roof.

2021-05-04 16:26:18,wallstreetbets,"I did some more DD. Looking at the fundamentals, Huya has revenue of about 1.5 billion USD. Twitch managed to increase revenues form 1.5B to 2B throughout 2020. Given the size of Asian markets compared to the US, this stock will keep on growing its revenue. Currently, the main issue is on the cost of revenue (about 80% of revenue) that is mainly allocated to Revenue Sharing Fees and Content Cost.

&#x200B;

Huya's top management decided to spend 310 million USD on a deal to acquire the rights for Chinese LoL events, broadcasting, etc. This represents a significant portion of Huya's yearly revenue! Why would top management take this decision? First, they are seeing a stable growth of users, which most probably will help cover the expense over the upcoming 3 years. Second, management knows they must increase the net income margin. By fixing the cost of the rights to the events top management is being confident that they will be able to earn more from the events than with variable costs. This could only be the case if they foresee an increased number of users. With this purchase they might have triggered one of Huya's best move to increase net margins over the upcoming 3 years!
