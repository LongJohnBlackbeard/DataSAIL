It's a completely different ride than your past investments, and requires different analysis. SCHD will let you earn returns and watch market movements while you figure out what sort of market player you want to be."
2021-05-26 19:50:06,stocks,"Whatever you choose, remember to average into your plays. Start with the $SPY (S&P500) it‚Äôs an ETF of the 500 most profitable companies in the US. Check out the FAANG stocks. Look for stocks with value, some with growth. Some with dividends and some with safety. Diversify. 4-7% is the ideal range for dividends. Over is usually too risky and under isn‚Äôt worth the capital. Let your divvys compound and DRIP. Compound interest is a mans best friend."
2021-05-26 19:46:48,stocks,"uh which other investing field is this that you apparently have future sight of a bear market

anyways voo/qqqm, if youre insistent on dividends, schd"
2021-05-26 19:47:31,stocks,"I have had good luck with Pfizer, which also has a decent dividend. They dropped a bit today so I plan to buy some more tomorrow. It's not a big mover though, it's a safe dividend stock."
2021-05-26 19:41:14,stocks,"If you think a bear is coming, just wait or you really hate your money XD.

In general, just buy voo/spy, their return is definitely better than any suggestions you get from reddit."

2021-05-26 19:36:05,stocks,"Great analysis, thank you!"
2021-05-26 19:41:18,stocks,Good point. Some serious momentum building!
2021-05-26 18:49:34,stocks,not really sure how they'd have a competitive advantage in brick and mortar since they're mostly digital stuff but sure this could be interesting
2021-05-26 19:21:52,stocks,All this will do is destroy long time family owned drug stores and regional companies all the while costing 3x times more for medication most likely being processed by the lowest bidder in china.

2021-05-26 19:00:14,stocks,"UNVC is nothing but a pennystock scam that they have been running for years.

EVERYONE SHOULD AVOID UNVC AT ALL COSTS.

This lie about the stock being uplisted to NASDAQ has been told for several years now and was always false.

AVOID UNVC !!!"

2021-05-26 19:06:30,stocks,"Never happening.  Hasn't happened during the 10 years they said it would.  

UNVC is not a real thing.  It's just a pennystock boilerroom type scam."
2021-05-26 19:07:35,stocks,"That was a shell,this is not that.someone else owns it now."
2021-05-26 19:10:02,stocks,"UNVC is a scam.  It is nothing but a scam.

All year long they were saying it would be uplisted to NASDAQ in April 2021.  Came and went.  Wasn't listed.  Same story as the past 10 years.  It's coming soon.   IT'S COMING NEVER!!!!!!

Don't be fooled by con artists.  Avoid UNVC before it falls back to $0.000001 per share just like every other time they ran this fraud."
2021-05-26 19:12:20,stocks,"All i know is i made gains this year after holding for 3 years,took some profit still long,im good."

2021-05-26 17:56:20,stocks,"I'm wondering if that decrease in consumer confidence is linked to the highly publicized inflation numbers from April. I'm definitely in line with the feds thinking that the inflation is likely just a bounce back from pandemic lows and so shouldn't be anything to be too concerned about, but I could see that affecting some more timid or fickle people  just like it seemed to make the markets slide for a few days"
2021-05-26 16:41:49,stocks,"If you want to hold the stock because you think it is going to rise again, you buy more shares at the low price and hold the original shares. You don‚Äôt sell anything. Put another way, you increase your position in the stock.

This also has the effect of averaging your cost basis among the various purchase points. You have your original 100 shares purchased at $10. When the stock price drops to $6, you purchase another 100 shares. You now have 200 shares at an average price of $8 per share."
2021-05-26 17:46:47,stocks,You lost me at new into trading.
2021-05-26 18:02:58,stocks,"Are you new to math too?

Why would you sell and buy back at the same price?"
2021-05-26 16:43:42,stocks,No reason to sell at 6 and buy back at 6. If you sell at a loss and buy back within 30 days the loss is added to your cost basis. Just buy 400 worth more if you want. No guarantee it will come back up. What is the stock?
2021-05-26 17:24:33,stocks,this guy owns a potential multi bagger in under a year! Hold baby üòÇüòÇ
2021-05-26 19:25:51,stocks,"I would not add unless you show a profit on your initial purchase.  If it goes to 30, you will still make plenty if you buy more at 12."
2021-05-26 16:46:14,stocks,"Not in a position to double my investment. To bring those numbers closer to whats actually happening, I invested a total of 4k into a stock thats worth around 2500. Was thinking of partially closing some shares and topping off before buying again at the dip"
2021-05-26 17:07:55,stocks,It makes no sense at all to sell at a loss only to buy more shares at the lower price. It‚Äôs basic math.

2021-05-26 18:59:41,stocks,Miner would have bought them up is what would have happened.  Expect gaming revenues to fall though a roof them these mining cards hit the market and buyer that got scalper cards hold on to them for longer due to the premium paid.
2021-05-26 17:43:05,stocks,"It is down by 1.66% after market, but up 9% in the last week, 13.5% in the last three months, 70% in the last year, and 1,300% in the last five years.   

This is definitely one of those ""built into the price"" situations, and the minor after market sell-off is likely people believing they have maximized their upside (as in the whole ""buy the rumor, sell the news"" strategy)."

2021-05-26 16:57:48,stocks,That is crazy! Stock should go up +20%
2021-05-26 18:29:27,stocks,"You can't. Look at ZScaler for example, it beat by a bit and it went up today, but I'm sure people sold before thinking it would drop. Don't try to time the market, you will have a terrible time."
2021-05-26 18:00:05,stocks,After the split
2021-05-26 17:07:10,stocks,Don‚Äôt worry about GME & AMC if you aren‚Äôt in them. What you should be worried about is the Reverse Repo Rates. In the last 3 days 1T USD has been pushed into the market at 0% interest. They have another collateral issue. 2.1M Mortgages are in the overdue 90+ days.
2021-05-26 16:26:44,stocks,"So... based on your first paragraph, I'm not sure you understand what a short is..."

You won‚Äôt find mainstream media talking about this though, so I can‚Äôt provide solid sources. Also no one really knows how much of the shorts have been covered, even though the mainstream media tries to put out numbers. This could go a lot deeper than what the media wants retail investors to know.

Also, I am not a financial expert."
2021-05-26 16:16:18,stocks,"Also, bankruptcies means they would have to pay the debt."
2021-05-26 16:20:21,stocks,People still talk about gme and amc. That ship is over. There are no more squeezes. Even if there were the hedges are fully prepared to cover it. Did you think they would let a bunch of cheeto lords cheat them out of money multiple times and still not do anything about it?
2021-05-26 17:37:05,stocks,Housing market is about to get wrecked.
2021-05-26 16:37:22,stocks,"Yeah, to my understanding, the main thing you have to do is pay interest. 

If you even get what happened in late January to occur again, it's going to cause a complete mess. People were locked out of their brokerage accounts or if they were able to get in, it was moving slowly.

Then imagine if what the apes say will happen does end up coming true. It'll probably be even worse..."

They think that a 10000+ price target or even higher is not a meme...at least some of them.

And I think that would cause problems.

Edit: However like I said in the general forum, what's going on in the general market is not really matching with late January."
2021-05-26 16:25:45,stocks,"I'm not a GME or AMC holder, but *cheat* is a bit ridiculous given hedge fund activities. More like retailers are coordinating. There's no cheat in that."
2021-05-26 18:25:41,stocks,I thought that also. But GME  is up 80 points in a week.

2021-05-26 17:29:43,stocks,Amc is a garbage stock and a garbage company. Going to movie theaters is going to die out just like drive ins did. The lockdown is over and it still hasn't really gained that much traction.
2021-05-26 16:51:06,stocks,Yea that was back in March. It's may now. It's never going that high again. Come back to reality
2021-05-26 16:55:26,stocks,How does living in a basement prevent you from making money at the expense of a hedge fund?
2021-05-26 17:17:34,stocks,There are institutions and big players invested in GME and AMC as well
2021-05-26 16:56:56,stocks,"No I don‚Äôt, but I also don‚Äôt think the hedge funds were prepared for the amount of effort and DD that has gone into this the past few months.  Have you read some of the DD?  It isn‚Äôt some high schooler writing those up.

Where dumb ass ape and dont think like other"
2021-05-26 16:58:06,stocks,It doesnt. The point is that the hedges won't get caught with their pants down again
2021-05-26 17:31:46,stocks,The only institutions invested in it are the ones shorting it. The only big players invested in it are either. Big players trying to short it or people who have a small amount invested for the purpose of a meme and hope that one day it might rise a little so they can sell it at a profit instead of taking a net loss on it.

2021-05-26 18:30:58,stocks,Definitely look into it more before buying. Filing K-1s can make your taxes more complicated and expensive. So owning M.L.Ps and L.Ps are only beneficial if you own a bunch of shares in order to off set that expense.

2021-05-26 15:27:35,stocks,"I unfortunately can't help you with any specifics, but I'd assume it's quite easy to write a program which tracks the stocks you put in, and gives you alerts if it goes back up, e.g. as in your example, 10$. I don't know if you can program though. I, for one, can't but will have to learn it to go to college."
2021-05-26 15:47:26,stocks,"i'm confused, what exactly do you want the order to do?

wait for a stock to drop precipitously and then buy when it goes up 10 bucks or buy when a stock goes up 10 bucks?

if youre expecting an order to predict the bottom, there's no way of doing that"
2021-05-26 17:19:08,stocks,"A potential workaround which I'm using is based on moving averages. 

I use trading view for most of my charting needs. 

For your scenario you may consider using a 20 period moving average for example.

A $10 increase from the hypothetical dip to $60 
Would generally correspond to a break above a certain periods (e.g. on a 4hour chart)'s 20 period moving average.

Trading view can send you an alert when the stock touches/breaks above the 20period MA.

You may then manually buy the stock."

2021-05-26 15:02:43,stocks,The juice has been squeezed on the travel stocks. Most are trading at or near pre COVID levels despite almost all of them being worse off.
2021-05-26 15:01:31,stocks,are you from 2020?
2021-05-26 15:32:22,stocks,"Hey man, as many in this thread have pointed out, airlines have already rallied, and are, as of right now, overvalued. Not a good investment. What still IS down, is Rolls Royce (RYCEY on US Stock Exchange i believe). 

They are an engine manufacturer for planes, and an army supplier for great britain, and they also deliver engines and other stuff for jet fighters etc. Their business model is that they get paid per flight hours flown with their engines, so as soon as plane travel comes back (which will be this year likely), rycey will also slowly rebound upwards. 

They have heavily diluted their stock in early 2020 for cash reserves, and were net negative in 2020 overall, but I'm sure they'll come back stronger. 

They have just finished the biggest plane engine testbed there is in the world, and are also in the finishing stage of a newer, bigger, more efficient plane turbine which will roll out end of year. 

You might want to check out r/RYCEY for recent news and more information. Cheers!"
2021-05-26 15:02:12,stocks,"Not in my opinion. I‚Äôve answered the same question before. I think the airlines are fucked for a decade or more. 

I used to do the financial planning for an airline so I do know more about this than 99.99% of people.

A couple of weeks ago I wrote:

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not the same businesses they were before.

Even if it was legal to open up again today, their capacity is massively reduced. Many planes have been parked in the desert and unparking costs are very significant. Their capacity and thus ability to generate revenue and profit is much lower but their fixed costs bases are still huge. These businesses will not be profitable again for many years.

Even before Corona, heavy fixed costs and heavy competition meant this was an industry of razor thin margins.

What are my credentials? I spent years working for an airline finally managing their financial planning function.

Not financial advice.‚Äù

I would add that I think business travel demand won‚Äôt recover for a decade either which means even if they had the same capacity, one of their biggest revenue streams is squelched."
2021-05-26 15:17:55,stocks,I'm with Warren when it comes to airlines.
2021-05-26 16:23:34,stocks,"I already sold my airline shares after the great rally they had and I felt they were stagnating. Full demand is not coming back in time for summer, Europe in particular is far from ready. But more importantly, coach is not where the money is at. Business travel is taking it's sweet time to come back.

The whole industry is changed."

Coupang, I not to interested as it seems not fairly valued at current price and is mostly South Korea.

Waiting for Tokopedia Gojek and will enter that as second SEA internet play."
2021-05-26 16:27:30,stocks,"SE will be a 500B mkt cap company easily if not a 1T before it‚Äôs over with. I absolutely love the vision of Forrest Li, Founder and CEO. I also appreciate they are taking a page from Amazon (AWS) and using their high revenue gaming leg of the business (Garena) to fund their other ventures until those then become profitable. 

3 Strong ‚ÄòLegs‚Äô of the business 

 - Garena, Shopee(E-Commerce), SeaMoney (Fintech) 

And they keep growing the business ‚Äòlegs‚Äô to stand on 

 - AI Labs, and Sea Capital 

Company will be huge.

Gojek and Tokopedia merged for a reason, SE is that reason."
2021-05-26 15:51:22,stocks,"I really like SE, but i think their valuation is mind boggling. They have so much competition in SE Asia ( Lazada, tokopedia). They are currently growing very agressively in order to gain market share. They are luring customer with discounts. I dont think that huge growth is sustainable. Nevertheless, I think the stock willl gain momentum again.

Coupang is also a cool company, but I think the market in Southkorea is too small, altought they have a huge online penetration in retail. I would like to see them entering new markets in South korea. 

Personally, I think BABA is currently just stupid undervalued. Its like China and SEA Etf with only fast growing companies"
2021-05-26 17:25:49,stocks,"Hey thanks for the feedback. It was irritating that it went down $11/share right away, but it happens. I bought Berk-b which also started sliding right away, but I feel confident it‚Äôs a good stock to hold longer term. 

I want to hold my investments a few years but I was starting to second guess that one pick for no logical reason. I just started getting single stocks and taking more risks. I had been in robo managed accounts and mutual funds before but I had some extra income to ‚Äúplay with‚Äù and I placed an almost $1,300 bet on SE"
2021-05-26 18:09:11,stocks,"Yeah I hear you, short term price movements after I buy often mess with my head too. I bought the 'dip' in February on NET for about $71, it continued to drop in the coming days all the way to $61, I was questioning myself hard but I knew NET was a good company with a great founder/CEO. Today it closed at almost $80 ! So i am okay with my buy point after all. High Growth stocks are very volatile and you have to have the stomach for that! 

I also have a nice bet on SE $4500, so we are in this together!"
2021-05-26 18:17:50,stocks,"I didn‚Äôt know about NET. I like the potential for anything with cloud, but my concern is that AWS will dominate cloud base technology.

I bought 10 shares for CRWD last Friday as well, and got in on SKYY. 

My reasoning with CPNG is that they have their own warehouses and logistics is really important even if South Korea is a small market.

I had read that SE just had one video game, but when I go back and look at their history, overall it leans up like it should. Congrats on hitting $80. I‚Äôve mentioned buying stocks like Tesla before 3+ years ago but never did it. I know it‚Äôs really hard to hit oil, and I can‚Äôt remember the other picks i had thought of, but overall- as long as I get a better return than the bank I‚Äôll have enough to retire in a third world country somewhere in 20 years. üëçüòÄ"

If someone doesn‚Äôt even know the basics of cooking and ingredients reading about it is meaningless, you need to the basics before literature begins to make sense.

I'm personally thinking of pulling the ripcord on BB right now to get out of it on today's gains.  So probably a good play lol."
2021-05-26 16:56:51,stocks,"Its been lumped in with the ""meme"" stocks or more accurately heavily shorted stocks. These memes are made because supposed ""smart"" money or wall street took heavy loses this entire year on shorted stocks including this week, and the internet has made memes that smart money my not be so smart. The shorters seem to think they can get there money back because of they say these stocks are overvalued. In the world of trading something is only worth what you can get someone to pay for it, retail all ready proved they would pay more. If the shorters do encounter an infinite squeeze there be forced to buy these stocks back at possible unbelievable prices. There needs to be more transparency in shorting but honestly after January there is less and its becoming a large issue in the stock market."
2021-05-26 17:24:26,stocks,"Your son isnt giving you any logical reasoning to invest in it other than he saw a meme about it through social media. Yeah, you might get lucky here and there but long-term, you are going to get burned 'investing' like this."

Ask him what his reasons are for investing in those stocks. Make sure he has been doing sound research and not because ‚Äúsome people on reddit said it was good.‚Äù If you like his reasons then it doesn‚Äôt hurt to invest some but make sure it is money you don‚Äôt need because investing is risky and you might lose it. 

I would also really recommend setting up an investing account for your son. Best way for him to learn is to experiment early on with his own money. He will thank you for it."
2021-05-26 18:31:50,stocks,"So I feel like your son is on wsb, so I would talk to him about that first. Tell him to take everything ont here with a grain of salt or two. Then I would invest in ETFs and maybe a 10-20√∑ share in individual stocks and other riskier investments."

2021-05-26 15:10:21,stocks,"Hey, I have a question as someone totally new to investing.  

I've invested in ETFs instead rather than traditional funds.  Is this a bad move? 

 ETFs just seemed to be much more within my price range while still acting pretty much identical to the actual funds they are supposed to represent.  

Are there downsides I don't know about?"
2021-05-26 14:57:29,stocks,Yes. I told him how smart he is and how proud I am. We check the stocks everyday together. He also told me to buy AMC and we did earlier. The reason I was worried about Blackberry is because he said it was just mainly a gut feeling mixed with reading up some. So I wasn't sure if it's better to put more in AMC instead of splitting between the two.

2021-05-26 17:40:42,stocks,"How long is 'long term' for you? Weeks? Months? Years? Decades? Invest your dollars into the market at large (an all-world etf) and keep adding when you can to build that nest egg. You won't get wild swings up in return, but you won't lose it all either. The market return of around 9% annually isn't to be sniffed at over decades. Especially if you keep adding regularly. Don't try to predict the market. You might get lucky but it will bite most people in the ass."
2021-05-26 15:08:02,stocks,"Doesn't sound like it.  I know this isn't the kind of advice you are looking for but as someone totally inexperienced myself, the constant ""who friggen knows!?"" articles concerning blackberry would stop me from putting much in it.  

I bought it as a meme stock when I first started investing (betting at this point) at $21 CAD.  I've lost over half my money on it so I've been keeping an eye on articles and it's literally a coin toss as to whether they say it's the next biggest thing or it's going nowhere.  100% of them say that they can't really recommend one way or another.

Hopefully someone here can give you a better idea but at this point, I doubt they can.  All I can say is that every stock that I've invested in with some some knowledge has done fairly well for me, and both ""It's a sure thing!"" stocks from reddit have kicked my ass."

But this morning i got an email regarding my TFSA which isnt a margin account but the email basically said that i owed money, huh, on friday my options expired ITM and i was good, i acknowledged this and did not want to exercise  but for some reason QT ""automatically exercised"" and bought all those shares out and that has never happened to me with any other options i have dealt with in the past. when i called them to see why this had happened they had a pretty hard time explaining why and they just sent an email stating that it was automatically exrcised because my option expired ITM and that i had the buying power to buy all those shares (which i didnt or i wouldnt have gotten the email saying that i owed money \* someone more educated pls correct me if im wrong about this). I sold all those shares and obviously i was in the green again."

2021-05-26 12:57:30,stocks,"Making 70% profit on any trade is exceptional.  Most traders would be thinking about locking in that profit.

If so, then that would be further reason to lock in the profits.  Decision is yours of course, good luck."

The only niche that is potentially profit making is packaged and processed foods, including meat alternatives such as Beyond Meat. While that has been a reasonably exciting stock, on the whole, the industry doesn‚Äôt seem to produce much excitement in terms of investment potential.

I believe it will take an absolute global crisis in the food supply chain in order to change enough minds about meat consumption. It is simply too deeply ingrained in our biology and culture across the world.

Again, the irony is that the healthiest diet of all is to consume whole foods, not packaged foods. So the money is in packaged foods, whether they are meat alternatives or just plain old junk food of any stripe."

He invested in RV stocks and sure enough it worked out. It's much easier to research a company when you are part of the ecosystem.

The next step is do research on areas you're interested in. If you're curious about gene editing or robotics, it makes researching the companies working on it that much easier. When you get caught up, companies will pop up with what they're doing in the space and you'll be better informed about whether a company is positioned to capitalize on that market.

Finally there are ancillary industries that other industries rely on, such as the chip market shortage causing issues with car manufacturers. So on and so forth."

I always like to tell about my most favorite burger: It actually was and still is a vegan burger of a specific company. I even liked it better at times I was really into meat. It just shows - at least for me - it is not really about taste.

I am not trying to convince anyone about eating vegetarian or anything, I just this as an argument, that there is potential. Potential through taste and countering mass-production of meat, which actually has to be reduced. (That last sentence is kind of weighted and maybe controversial.

2021-05-26 00:00:00,stocks,"How many stocks is too many? Hey- hoping to hear some feedback/advice

I‚Äôm 23 years old, CPA, currently investing about $2,000 per month into individual stocks. Total portfolio is about $40k, made up of 28 stocks. Mostly high multiple tech (ARK stocks), but also some healthcare, big tech, and REITs. I also have a Roth that I contribute $500 per month.

I won‚Äôt need the money for 20-30+ years, and I‚Äôm comfortable holding through volatility. My focus is really just finding quality companies that will be long-term winners. My question is:

1. How many stocks is enough to be adequately diversified as the portfolio grows? I feel i could cut down to under 20 stocks and concentrate in my top holdings. 

2. I‚Äôve been aggressively buying stocks on the way down and trimming positions on the way up. How often should I be taking profit? Does this strategy make sense long-term?

Thanks in advance"
2021-05-26 12:15:07,stocks,"1. Depends on how many you can keep track of. If you want diversification and don‚Äôt want to hold an ETF, it is up to you. But most recommend 8- 12 and I agree on that. Also why would you put money in your 19th pick if you could also buy more of your first 5? Your portfolio does not sound that diversified, but that does not have to be a bad thing imo, invest what you know. Don‚Äôt invest in some random companies just to diversify.


2. It is up to you, it is not a bad strategy, but I would evaluate more on fundamental changes compared to the price action. If a stock is performing well for a reason, keep it and ofc also the other way around."
2021-05-26 12:20:38,stocks,"I think diversification is mainly to protect against volatility and to protect against bigger losses. I don't think diversifying will help make you more money, but help you not lose money during uncertainty. It's never a bad idea to dip your toes into a bunch of different areas, but it's mainly to protect against volatility, not to outperform the market. If you knew 1 stock was going to go up 300% in a month, would you allocate 5%, 15%, 50% of your portfolio? If you knew for sure, most people would only choose 1 or 2 winners. It all has to do with protecting yourself.

To answer your questions:

1. It's depending on your goals and your risk tolerance. The more diversified you are the more protected you are against volatility and losses. It's also not just about the number, but the quality. Just holding 100 different stocks doesn't mean anything, it all depends on the sectors and companies you're actually investing in. But to give a number, I hate following the news for more than 10 companies. It's harder to give a direct answer for this because it's more about how you invest, I have friends who are much more diversified than I am. 
2. It's better to buy during uncertainty so you can catch the rebound on the way back up. It's better(in my opinion) to invest when there's lots of bleeding going on, not when everything is rallying. I tend to take profits when everything is rallying, not buy. I set benchmarks for profit-taking. I'll take small profits if I reach those benchmarks, and I base it all off of % not off of numbers. You definitely want to learn how to take out profits that you feel good about, whether that's your initial investment, 1/5x your initial investment or whatever. It helps make you feel better about investing and making money and it helps not feel worse if your portfolio ever crashes because at least you made money.

If you feel confident in a few stocks, it doesn't hurt to have a small portfolio. Warren Buffet says to stick to a few you believe in, and Kevin O'Leary has something like 500 holdings. It's for different goals and different strategies. Personally I had about 25-30 stocks/ETFs I was holding up until about January but I was too overwhelmed and I felt like I had to trim down. Now I only have about 10 personally, that's all I can keep up with. It's hard for me to keep up with a bunch of different companies entirely, I follow all the news I can and the more I invest in the more stressful it becomes. I don't like investing in something I don't know enough about. It all depends on your goals and strategies."
2021-05-26 13:13:55,stocks,"ETFs that track big indexes are the easiest way to diversify.  S&P 500 ETFs are among the most popular in America.  Holding individual stocks is always tricky to achieve diversification. You need to diversity not just by industry, but by market capitalization, geography, growth versus value, and other parameters.  That is hard to do even with 20 stocks.  Young investors tend to over-weight technology because they have never seen a tech stock collapse, like happened in 2000.  So make sure you don't rely too heavily on any one industry.

Regarding market timing, that is very tough and full of landmines.  Buy low and sell high is the goal, but most small investors end up doing the opposite.  They panic sell and FOMO buy.  Personally, I like to hold long term, as opposed to frequent trading."

2021-05-26 17:23:13,stocks,"I try to keep it around 10 high conviction stocks, of which I attend earnings calls and am completely on top of. More would be too much work. Sometimes I pool stocks into a single play, like for example I own 3 stocks from different stages of the semiconductor supply chain, but I count them as 1. Ideally I make quarterly revisions to my portfolio where I adjust allocations depending on market condition, but to be honest I sometimes start moving stuff around when a probable catalyst is expected short term and start concentrating in that like a degenerate.

 I close positions when I find a better stock than a specific one in my portfolio and ""trade them"".

I also use a correlation table to avoid having too much exposure to the same trends. This is key to measure your diversification. If you have 1000 stocks that always move together then you are not diversified."

Honestly, at this time, I don‚Äôt count the stocks in my portfolio. I just buy stocks in companies I believe in after doing my research. Is it a hit every time? No; that‚Äôs why I‚Äôve already sold a few companies that have been underperforming (can always re-purchase them later).

I noticed that we recently just achieved classical computer obsoletion, with [the first quantum microchips being made to run at room temperature instead of around -400¬∫K](https://www.xanadu.ai/hardware). I'm wondering if anyone knows of any publicly traded quantum computing companies, or any companies like Google or Microsoft that are public that either plan to dabble in it or have already started.

I'm no quantum physicist or code-monkey, just an audio engineer geek, but what little knowledge I have of quantum computers is it fixes the problem that classical computers have had from the beginning: only being truly serial binary machines. Classical computers use binary to have absolute values: 1 or 0 (1 bit). Quantum computers use quantum entanglement of laser light to create superimposed values: 1 or 0, 1 and 0, 1 and 1, 0 and 0 (1 qubit). Not many know this, but when you have Google Chrome, Steam, and Spotify all open, your computer is switching off between processing power very quickly because binary only works in 1 or 0! A quantum computer can truly actually be processing more than 1 thing at the same time, because it can be 1 or 0, 1 and 0, etc.!

This technology can be applied to logistics, blockchains, payment networks (could potentially process near ‚àû/second transactions simultaneously as opposed to VISA's 1700/second), etc. The possibilities are endless and I want in!!!"

The claims are somewhat overblown. Remember that every quantum computing expert telling you how wonderful the tech is also is trying to make money/fame. A quantum computer is not necessarily faster than a classical computer--rather, it is much faster at a few particular kinds of problems, and equally fast or slower at most others (depending on how you try to make an apples to apples comparison). Given the high cost involved in making one with a large number of qubits and low errors, it is likely that classical computers will persist for a very long time, and quantum computers may never gain widespread adoption (think something like modern supercomputers, housed in special facilities, rather than something in your phone). That said, there are a few situations in which they may prove disruptive: encryption/decryption, simulation of complex systems (biological, quantum, etc.), and search algorithms, for example. 

Also keep in mind that there are a lot of different competing approaches right now. Superconductors, light, atoms, ions, molecules, NV centers, quantum dots--no one knows which realization, if any, will be the one that is actually commercially viable. My personal suggestion is, if you want to play the 'quantum revolution', play it like you would the gold rush. Invest in Levi's, picks, and shovels, not the actual companies mining for gold."

2021-05-26 12:49:56,stocks,Wtf does price per share have to do with anything. Throw that out of your analysis ASAP. Aapl is a fine company that I have held for years and plan on holding well into the future. Imo That said Google and FB are cheaper or similar value with more growth and Amzn while more expensive I would argue is also cheaper if you factor in growth. Msft is probably in a similar situation.
2021-05-26 13:10:51,stocks,"Price per share should be the last consideration when choosing to buy a stock unless you can't access fractionals.

AAPL now has a lower P/E than other FAANGMs but higher than its historical with very little change in its revenue streams. The increased premium could be justified from its growing revenues from services and future plans in EVs and some other tech. Whether it is overvalued now or not is debatable. It will likely retain its growth rate as long as people love Apple products. 

I don't find any of the FAANGMs to be overvalued at the moment. They are immensely profitable, growing like what you'd expect from growth companies, and their products are globally popular and likely to stay that way. I will pounce on any huge dips off inflation fears and whatnot."
2021-05-26 11:49:59,stocks,Anyone from the FAANG + Microsoft bunch are good holds. I think you can just have a bunch of them and enjoy holding them. They will all serve very well. No need to pick just one.

They posted great numbers last couple quarters and their products are great. Boosted dividends and buybacks but I dont see same growth it had over last couple years. Look at it post split, it split around 125 back in August i think, still hovers arnd there. FB, GOOGL performed much better during same time.
It seems expensive over here but doesnt hurt to start small position and add on as it correct."
2021-05-26 19:56:00,stocks,I trimmed Apple and plowed into Facebook - which has a smaller market cap and faster growth rate.

CVS Health, Walgreens Boots Alliance and Rite Aid shares fell on a report that Amazon may open brick-and-mortar pharmacies.

The Business Insider report, which cited anonymous sources, said Amazon is considering opening standalone retail pharmacies or adding them to Whole Foods stores.

Drugstore chains have already been squeezed by more consumers buying front-of-store items online.

This is a good news as amazon continue to disrupt other industry. If amazon can add the retail pharmacies to the whole foods stores, that could attract more potential shoppers and boost whole foods stores revenue. It continue to shows that amazon want to expand into health care industry and keep diversifying the business. The stock is trading under $3300, investors can consider buying and holding for long term."

2021-05-26 13:31:40,stocks,So...one more store in the mix.  I'll go with the legendary pharmacies
2021-05-26 19:46:13,stocks,"This is great idea if the pricing is comparable.This is not like Wholefoods where there is a tight window to delivery it so it stays fresh plus there were lots of issues with missing items,items that weren't fresh."

If it was easy to compete in the retail pharmacy business with CVS and Walgreens, you'd think that Target with its existing brick and mortar footprint and ecommerce platform should have been able to do it. Yet they decided to sell to CVS and now the Target pharmacies are in fact CVS."

2021-05-26 17:29:16,stocks,"I definitely can see it slumping to $80.  It got a bump from Target earnings high, and now they don't report till August.  I would bet it picks up in July in preparations of earnings"
2021-05-26 17:26:57,stocks,No it isn't lol. CVS has tons of contracts that *explicitly* exclude non-CVS pharmacies.
2021-05-26 14:58:12,stocks,"Excellent example and I 100% agree. CVS also plays both sides of the transaction with Aetna as the payor, which gives them an additional edge"
2021-05-26 14:59:21,stocks,Completely agree. It seems to hover around support levels for a while and then has periodic breakouts. We jus saw a breakout after Q1 earnings. Now I imagine it will hover and test $90 for a while before breaking out again
2021-05-26 17:31:04,stocks,"Okay but that could be because other pharmacies don‚Äôt want to bother given the reimbursement rates. 

CVS can‚Äôt exclude other pharmacies for no reason. If Amazon doesn‚Äôt want to partake in it, that‚Äôs a different story."
2021-05-26 17:39:03,stocks,"CVS excludes other pharmacies because client employers agree to it for their groups. Has little to do with what other pharmacies want or do not want. Pharmacies that don't want to work with CVS are rare, maybe excepting compounding pharmacies. Vast majority have some kind of contract already, although it often excludes maintenance drugs (ie, unit shifters). CVS also already works with government insurance, via Silverscript and a ton of Medicaid groups, although I don't think they can require patients to go to CVS (pharmacy lock in can still apply).

The only way for Amazon to make good on retail pharmacies is by launching their own pbm or buying another company out that operates one. CVS runs the largest pbm in the country by far--quite legally. 

I don't get the sense you know much about what drives pharmacy payor profits."
2021-05-26 17:51:31,stocks,Amazon Pharmacy already contracts with Caremark so I‚Äôm not sure where you‚Äôre getting this idea that the only way Amazon can be successful is if they make their own PBM.
2021-05-26 18:08:39,stocks,"Most CVS plans exclude Amazon, and every other pharmacy, from filling maintenance or specialty drugs for commercial members.

If you think Amazon will make a killing off generic antibiotics, be my guest."
2021-05-26 18:37:13,stocks,"The question isn‚Äôt about what level of profits Amazon makes. The argument you‚Äôre proposing is that Amazon won‚Äôt get accepted into Caremark which is objectively false. Amazon Pharmacy can fulfill orders for Caremark managed patients already.

Your new argument now is what kind of profits Amazon will make. Of course relying on other PBMs will generate less margin than owning your own PBM. That isn‚Äôt rocket science. I‚Äôm not arguing against that. I‚Äôm just saying it‚Äôs not a necessity for Amazon to make it‚Äôs own PBM. Given the scale and logistics experience of Amazon, they will make a profit with whatever the reimbursements are from Caremark, including maintenance drugs like Metformin or Blood Pressure Meds. Antibiotics aren‚Äôt maintenance drugs nor are they specialty drugs FYI, not sure why you used that as an example. 

Specialty drugs is a different topic and reimbursement models are more complex for these but again, it‚Äôs just a matter of contract. Amazon doesn‚Äôt need it‚Äôs own PBM to fulfill these. Typically just requires a URAC accreditation."
2021-05-26 19:16:36,stocks,"Amazon won't make money unless they get PBM market share period. The largest PBM in the country excludes them from receiving payments for the vast majority of medications. You're missing my point. Amazon won't be getting payments for maintenance drugs from CVS *because most Caremark contracts feature CVS-only fills.* Some plans are more open ended on pharmacy networks but only if the client employer opts into it. Maintenance choice and retail 90 plan designs determine the pharmacy network, and most are the more restrictive former option. Caremark's plans almost universally feature specialty drugs *only* being filled at CVS specialty pharmacy. If people want to try to buy specialty drugs without insurance at a pharmacy of their choice, I wish them luck.

Who's paying for all the shit, Pig? The PBM--which directs patients as to where they can or cannot fill. The economic ramifications should be obvious. 

CVS Caremark is moated; an Amazon pharmacy enterprise without a PBM is anything but."
2021-05-26 19:21:25,stocks,"Do you have any evidence that Caremark doesn‚Äôt pay Amazon Pharmacy claims for maintenance drugs? 

First of all you need to understand that maintenance drugs and specialty drugs are two separate categories of drugs, you keep mixing them together.

Specialty drugs as I said in my other comment is very complex and require URAC accreditation to get the talks for contracting started. It isn‚Äôt completely off the table. Amazon can pursue it if it wanted to if the numbers make sense but Caremark could require one sided contract that Amazon may not find it to be worth anything.

Amazon. Already. Does. Maintenance. Drugs. For. Caremark. Patients. Your head doesn‚Äôt seem to grasp this for whatever reason. I have gotten my maintenance drugs before, as someone who‚Äôs claims are paid by Caremark. 

Most Caremark contracts don‚Äôt force patients to use CVS. If this was true, no independent pharmacy would be able to serve Caremark patients or like 1/3rd of the country. You think a Caremark customer can‚Äôt get their shit from Walgreens? Call a local Walgreens and ask if they accept Caremark then get back to me, dumbass."
2021-05-26 19:24:03,stocks,I work for Caremark lol.
2021-05-26 19:45:18,stocks,"I highly doubt that. If you did, you‚Äôd understand the difference between specialty and maintenance drugs. You‚Äôd also know that Amazon Customers that are with Caremark can get their maintenance meds through Amazon."
2021-05-26 19:55:13,stocks,"A) Never said maintenance drugs and specialty drugs are under the same classification. I brought up specialty drugs as an example of how the CVS PBM forces payment through an in house pharmacy--rather than any other one. Most commercial plans feature maintenance choice, which generally restricts maintenance drugs to CVS or the mail order pharmacy. Some plans feature an opt out option, and some plans feature the retail 90 plan design which isn't restrictive. Your plan may be one of these. Which leads me to B.

B) If you bothered reading anything I said you'll notice where I repeated the word ""most."" Most plans are restrictive. Some are not. If you call up Walgreen's yourself they would tell you most Caremark plans will not pay at their pharmacy for maintenance medications beyond grace fills, if that. The ability of the PBM to steer patients to a specific pharmacy is its moat; as I said most Caremark plans will not pay for drugs at Amazon.

C) I am not surprised by you cussing me out lol. Not surprised at all, judging by the famous quality and learning of our ""clientele."""

Fist of all, I think of ‚Äútrading‚Äù to be a pejorative term for ‚Äúinvesting‚Äù. All those people who day trade and swing trade are gambling.. which in essence is fine! However, they‚Äôre playing with their savings and you think it‚Äôs proper investing. Buffet say ‚Äútime in the market beats timing the market‚Äù. Stop looking for a quick penny because chances are, you‚Äôre going to get emotional and fail. 

Stay away from options for the first year. Idk if you‚Äôre trading options or equities, but stick to equities until you get your footing. 

Second of all, the best way to win in an equity market is time. Markets fluctuate. If you have a conviction, stick to it. Even if you appear to be wrong, stay with your thesis. You might be right in the end, but if you sold too early into red, you‚Äôre wrong and you lose. 

Target ETF‚Äôs. Most people fail to consistently pick winners. That‚Äôs why ETF‚Äôs come in handy. Let the professionals make the picks. Take $20 a week and put it into the $SPY. Average into positions, and don‚Äôt YOLO. Beware the FOMO demon too. He‚Äôs big, he‚Äôs loud, and he‚Äôs convincing, but he‚Äôs evil at nature. Make coordinated moves with conviction. Make a journal and diary your thoughts and plays.

While waiting on the dip, i'll move the money to VOO, where i'll either be wrong and not make as much as I could, or will be right, and will have saved myself from a 15% qtrly dip that brazil likes to do.

I think there is a least one, maybe two more of these quarterly dips and rises before brazil either 1) breaks it's trend and keeps rising at a steady rate or 2) election cycle chaos causes a 20% dip overnight, in which I'll buy back into right away.  Afterall, it's Bolso vs. whoever the PT is able to wrangle up - A literal shitstorm waiting to happen, so I'd rather sit it out.

tldr, i've got some money in EWZ, and it's treated me well these last 4 months. i'm going to try and play off the cyclic pattern to get a little more out of it; - But i'll be gone before the next presidential election cycle-"

The bronco appears to catching many people's attention. I like the pick just maybe its more of a long term play. Stay strong on your thoughts, stay ""Built Ford Tough""

2021-05-26 11:41:45,stocks,"F is a great play! They have a good potential, especially with the F-150 lightning, but could the chip shortage possibly hold them back for a little while? If you can, possibly average down if they go down to 11.50"
2021-05-26 11:21:37,stocks,Ford was my first stock purchase too!  But I bought in March last year- 100 shares at 5.54. Hold for the long term
2021-05-26 10:45:01,stocks,Congrats! Invest for long term. There are a lot of stories of successful traders but those are few and far between.
2021-05-26 13:03:31,stocks,I held Ford for about 7 years. Just sold it last week. Had 1700 shares.
2021-05-26 19:08:32,stocks,First lesson. Buy before it takes off. Not after.
2021-05-26 12:58:22,stocks,"If you bought F because you like it as a company and it's potential in the future, then ok.

If you just bought it because the stock price appear low as compared to other good companies, then you are making the classic beginner's mistake of buying low price stocks, as they appear cheap on per share basis."
2021-05-26 13:18:47,stocks,"Congratulations on your first ever purchase.  Ford is a traditional company that is betting big on EV and self-driving, so it is moving forward with tech advances.  You will add many more stocks in the coming years and gain plenty of experience.  Welcome to investing.    : )"
2021-05-26 19:23:02,stocks,"My 1/2022 10c‚Äôs are printing right now, bullish on $F juve!!"
2021-05-26 19:26:29,stocks,F
2021-05-26 16:27:44,stocks,"Hi. Good for you.  Just a first day tip for you on the terminology: the word you want is ""shares"" not ""stocks"".  For whatever reason, when you buy multiple units of a company, those are called shares, not stocks.  

If you say ""stocks"" that's a reference to plural different companies.  

So you could say you bought 100 shares of Ford.  Don't say you bought 100 stocks of Ford.  

If someone says they bought 5 *stocks*, that would imply they bought shares of 5 different companies.  

All that said, my advice would be to treat owning a stock like owning an animal: it needs to have a certain amount of care and attention all the time.  Do homework on it.  Read the reports, listen to the calls, know who runs it, know the competition, know the price ranges, know its risks and catalysts.  Don't be one who says ""I will own this forever"".  You never know.  Many of the stocks someone pledged their life to 20 years ago have collapsed or gone away.  Have an exit in mind.  For example, if you think, as I do, that Ford can go to 15-16 by next year, and it happens to get there next week, I'd seriously just consider that my goal was achieved early, and I consider taking the money.  Of course, the day than happens, I'd be considering all the factors as of that day, because I would have been doing my daily homework all along.  Maybe there's new information at that time which tells me my new target should be 20.  But if not, then the goal is met, sell my animal, and look to buy something else, or wait for Ford to fall back to $11 for no good reason and do it again."

You drive a ford?"

2021-05-26 15:11:32,stocks,"In response to all saying they have debt and don‚Äôt even have the electric F150 out yet‚Ä¶

All the car companies that are competing with F have debt. Which ones are profitable without government handouts & loans or a side hustle? They are valued by their potential EV sales 5, 10 or 20 years into the future. 

I can‚Äôt go to the local dealership lot and buy an all EV truck (with a bed)  from anyone else yet, can I? 

Why is F held to a different standard? Maybe because their CEO doesn‚Äôt love to tweet or he is not a ‚Äústrong woman‚Äù.  F has been around a long time and has a new CEO who wants to compete in the EV market. I wouldn‚Äôt count them out. 

By the way I‚Äôm a woman and I don‚Äôt currently own any F stock. I just don‚Äôt see why they are viewed like they are a thing of the past. They have years of experience to bring to the table. 

Rant over."
2021-05-26 15:38:44,stocks,"Lol, I bought 1000 shares of Ford back in March at its 2 year high. Today I sold all of them. I agree Ford wil go higher but after the volatile April and May I just had to sell them for my peace of mind and cash in my profit. I'll definitely scoop back some shares if it goes down. You might have to hold a few months to break even but it was a good decision for a first purchase."
2021-05-26 15:59:31,stocks,I see a lot of buzz around Ford. It seems like a lot of positive movement in the EV world but idk if I like it long term. So many electric and self driving vehicles it‚Äôll just be dictated on new releases of vehicles and ability to self drive in the near term
2021-05-26 16:52:54,stocks,"I actually am impressed that you're considering aspects like inflation (even though I'm not as fearful of inflation as pundits are, good on you for at least having it on your mind) and secondly for implying that you would be willing to sell.  Too many beginners make an oath to ""hold it forever"".  During my career, that mindset has been ruinous.  Few stocks are worth keeping blindly, forever.  They rise and fall.  Today's best company can be next decade's joke.  Stocks are mostly pieces of paper, symbols, computer digits.  They're not your family.  You buy them with the expectation of making money, and that only happens when you sell. 

Also glad to see you realizing your timing might not have been ideal.  Today was an investor day for Ford, which is typically an event that overhypes the company and the stock.  Buying a stock on a +10% day, you're certainly not getting it on sale.

I would have also liked to see you maybe say you're prepared to lose money, because that is also a reality of stock market investing."
2021-05-26 16:56:31,stocks,"If there was anytime not to buy $F, its right now when the hype and inflated price is at it's highest."
2021-05-26 17:25:36,stocks,"Ford needs to reinstate its dividend and i would probably buy it.  Whether electric or gas, Ford and the other automakers outlook is going to remain very similar to what it currently is."
2021-05-26 17:57:11,stocks,"Not the worst gamble but I‚Äôd encourage you to learn all you can about investing before doing much else. Some reading:

**START HERE:** [‚ÄúIf You Can‚Äù by William Bernstein.](https://www.etf.com/docs/IfYouCan.pdf)

If you want an expanded version of that, Bernstein‚Äôs book ‚ÄúThe Four Pillars of Investing‚Äù is amazing.

I am not a fan of buying individual stocks and prefer buying all of them via index funds. Here‚Äôs another Bernstein article on that:

[The 15-Stock Diversification Myth ](http://www.efficientfrontier.com/ef/900/15st.htm)

> ‚Ä¶ **a grossly disproportionate fraction of the total return came from a very few ""superstocks""** like Dell Computer, which increased in value over 550 times. If you didn‚Äôt have one of the half-dozen or so of these in your portfolio, then you badly lagged the market. (The **odds of owing one of the 10 superstocks are approximately one in six.**) Of course, by owning only 15 stocks you also increase your chances of becoming fabulously rich. But unfortunately, in investing, it is all too often true that **the same things that maximize your chances of getting rich also maximize your chances of getting poor.**

> ‚Ä¶even 100 stocks are not nearly enough to eliminate this very important source of financial risk.

> So, yes, Virginia, you can eliminate nonsytematic portfolio risk, as defined by Modern Portfolio Theory, with a relatively few stocks. It‚Äôs just that nonsystematic risk is only a small part of the puzzle. Fifteen stocks is not enough. Thirty is not enough. Even 200 is not enough. **The only way to truly minimize the risks of stock ownership is by owning the whole market.**

Added bold for emphasis. This is an argument in favour of index fund investing over stock-picking.

Now, it‚Äôs possible Ford will turn into one of those ‚Äúsuper stocks‚Äù Bernstein mentions. I personally think it‚Äôll do well - despite Tesla getting all the attention, Ford (and other big auto companies) have the infrastructure Tesla doesn‚Äôt, so they may be able to pivot to EVs and eat Tesla‚Äôs lunch. That‚Äôs a gamble though.

IMO, most people would be better off with an index fund for most of their investments, maybe save a few percent for single stock gambles. Ford is contained within most major stock indices so you can own it indirectly that way.

Good luck, I hope the above helps!"

2021-05-26 11:50:34,stocks,"""A little longer""

The insight I would give to you is to not start investing by looking to sell in terms of days or weeks, but months and preferably years. If you believe in 'Ford the companies' outlook then they need to time to realize that in order to turn your investment into real profit. Companies need time to make products and sell them before they make it to their quarterly results which then makes it into their stock valuation.

You get higher taxes if you sell less than a year after buying. So there is added incentive to invest long term. I'll add that paying taxes means you're making money so it's not a terrible thing to do.

[https://turbotax.intuit.com/tax-tips/investments-and-taxes/guide-to-short-term-vs-long-term-capital-gains-taxes-brokerage-accounts-etc/L7KCu9etn](https://turbotax.intuit.com/tax-tips/investments-and-taxes/guide-to-short-term-vs-long-term-capital-gains-taxes-brokerage-accounts-etc/L7KCu9etn) 

Finally, since I don't know your intentions, maybe you do just want to play short term. If so you might want to skip stocks and go straight into LEAPS. Where you can get better returns with more risk, but not as risky as other options plays. The value of leaps follows more closely with the stock price and gives you plenty of time to sell it at a high point.

[https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/pros-and-cons-trading-leaps-2018-01-05](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/pros-and-cons-trading-leaps-2018-01-05)

Tip: Buy these on red days

Tip: Leaps also allows you to lock in a price while you transfer money to exercise the option. If you really want the stock that is."
2021-05-26 16:45:25,stocks,Idk if Tesla is valued 600Billion Ford should be 2 Trillion.  The F150 lightning is going to destroy the cyber truck in sales and is a real product.

2021-05-26 13:26:43,stocks,I think F is a good long term hold. The announcement of the F-150 EV and the smaller Maverick pickup releasing in 2022 are huge.

At Shell‚Äôs annual general meeting last week, shareholders [voted overwhelmingly in favor](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/18/shell-secures-backing-for-climate-strategy-but-growing-minority-rebel.html) of the company‚Äôs energy transition plans ‚Äî but, crucially, a growing minority rejected the strategy, insisting the oil giant needed to do much more in the fight against climate change.

Activist investor Follow This said at the time that the result was likely to mean Shell would have to revise its climate targets once again.

According to Reuters, the case is the first in which activists have taken a major energy firm to court to compel it to overhaul its climate strategy.

When the lawsuit was filed, a lawyer acting on behalf of environmental groups said the case would ‚Äúraise the pressure‚Äù on other fossil fuel companies.

The trick is helping those countries bypass older tech as much as possible. 
i.e. maybe they could have better power generation and distribution if less money was needed for oil infrastructure. The hard part is getting over initial capital costs.

It will take a while, but gas & petrol will get more expensive as countries cut their usage Fuel is only ""cheap"" due to the massive amount of infrastructure built over the last 100 years. As the infra is phased out, prices will increase."

You‚Äôre trying to predict a system thats billions of years old with what? 150-200 years worth of data and even then the patterns are not terribly clear unless you find what you‚Äôre looking for, lol.

If it was as big of an emergency as they say it is they‚Äôd reduce emissions from the military and the marine shipping industry, guess it‚Äôs not important for them as it should be for us.

This is just a cash and tax grab reinforced with virtue signaling, nothing more nothing less.

That's an entirely different type of product. Oil companies don't have the resources to build up those kinds of products to compete with companies that have been producing them for decades. They would be way behind. Those industries are very competitive and capex intensive.

Shell, Exxon Mobil, etc getting into solar would be like how Microsoft got into smartphones years late, and made the Windows Phone which flopped. They then managed to succeed by playing to their strengths in the business software world, and innovating in the cloud.

If I was an investor, I'd rather invest in an established solar company with established products than an oil company with all sorts of liabilities that is trying to pivot.

And yes taxes hurt economies, but the impact of taxes can be offset somewhat by spending the tax revenue.   The best plan by far is just offering everyone a pro-rata credit based on all carbon taxes collected.  E.G. if a carbon tax in the US generates $300 billion in revenue each quarter, each citizen will get a quarterly check for $1,000 (assuming 300m people).   Net cost to taxpayers is zero, but those who fly more and eat more meat and own humvees will lose relative to those who don't travel and take the bus.

Yes, it would still be a net detriment to the economy in the short term (as we would be pushing people away from the most efficient and cheapest fuel sources), but presumably we should be willing to take that hit in order to do more to fight climate change."

# The Income Statement

**What is it?**

The income statement is one of the most common and important financial  statements you‚Äôll come across. It‚Äôs also known as the profit and loss  (P&L) statement, summarizing all income and expenses over the period  of analysis, often shared as quarterly and annual reports.

**What is its purpose?**

The function of an income statement is to show a company‚Äôs financial performance over the period of analysis.

**What is inside an income statement?**

* **Revenue:** The amount of money a business takes in during a reporting period
* **Expenses:** The amount of money a business spends during a reporting period
* **Costs of goods sold (COGS):** The cost of component parts of what it takes to make whatever it is a business sells
* **Gross profit:** Total revenue less COGS
* **Operating income:** Gross profit less operating expenses
* **Income before taxes:** Operating income less non-operating expenses
* **Net income:** Income before taxes less taxes
* **Earnings per share (EPS):** Division of net income by the total number of outstanding shares
* **Depreciation:** The extent to which assets (for example, aging equipment) have lost value over time
* **EBITDA:** Earnings before interest, depreciation, taxes, and amortization

>*These items often contain sub categories and separate line items depending on a company‚Äôs reporting and accounting policies.*

**Classifying Expenses**

**There are three different types of expenses**

**1.** **Operating Expenses**

>**a.** Expenses associate with the operations of the business.**b.** Direct costs of producing the product/service and other expenses associated with production, including SG&A expenses.

**2.** **Financing Expenses**

>**a.** Expenses associated with the use on non-equity financing.**b.** Most often taking form of interest expenses on debt.

**3.** **Capital Expenses**

>**a.** Expenses that provide benefits over many years.**b.** For a manufacturing company these can be plant & equipment.**c.** For non-manufacturing companies they can be less conventional and tangible forms.

**Their Placement**

>***No images allowed on the sub, so here's a link:*** [*https://imgur.com/WCDqBee*](https://imgur.com/WCDqBee)  
>  
>üìå **SUMMARY:**  Operating expenses associate with operations of the business, financing  expenses with non-equity financing and capital expenses with ones that  provide benefit over many years.

Revenue Recognition

For  most firms, revenue recognition is a simple process, where once a  product or service is sold, it is recorded as revenues. For firms that  sell products or services over many years (eg. subscriptions) it becomes  trickier.

**Under ASC 606 (new revenue recognition standard):**

* The  new model‚Äôs core principle for revenue recognition is to ‚Äúdepict the  transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that  reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in  exchange for those goods or services.‚Äù
* Thus,  for a real estate developer working on a multi-year construction,  revenues should be recognized as construction progresses, and for a  software firm that enters in a contract over many years, performance  obligations will determine when revenues get recognized.

>**üìå  SUMMARY: For most firms, when a product or service is sold, it is  recorded as revenues. For firms that deal with long term contracts,  memberships, subscriptions etc. revenue is recorded depending on sum and  duration - eg. $120,000 for 1 year of service = $10,000/month recorded  revenue.**

Revenue breakdowns

As companies enter **multiple businesses and different geographies**, it is useful to know **where they generate their revenues.**

**Where** are **geographic breakdowns found?**

* While the breakdown can **sometimes** by provided in **income statements**, they are more likely to be part of the **footnotes to the financial statements.**
* Companies generally break down ***revenues by geography***, though the degree of detail can vary.
* Companies also break down ***revenues by business segment***, though there is an element of **subjectivity to the segment categorization.**

>**üìå SUMMARY:** Companies generally **break down revenues by geography** with a varying degree of detail and **revenues by business segments**  subjective to the segment categorization. Both can sometimes be found  in the income statement, but generally they are found in the **footnotes of the financial statements.**

Operating expenses: Breakdown

Operating  expenses are broken down into expenses directly related to producing  the goods or services that give rise to revenues, i.e. cost of goods  sold, and expenses that are related to operations, but which are not as  directly tied to revenues.

**How** are operating expense broken down?

1. Expenses directly **related to the production** of goods / services that **increase revenues.** These are **netted out** form **revenues to get gross profits.**
2. Expenses related to operations, not directly tied to revenues. These are **netted out** from **gross profits to get operating income.**

**SG&A Costs**

1. In many companies, the **largest** **non-operating expense is S, G & A**, a term that can include everything but the kitchen sink.

>**üìå SUMMARY:** Companies **break down revenues** by how they **relate to production** or **operations.** The **former tied to the increase of revenues,** the **latter not.**

Depreciation

There are three forms of depreciation; **economic, accounting & tax depreciation.**

1. **Economic Depreciation**

This reflects the **loss in value (earning power) in an asset, as it ages.** It requires nuance, and will vary across even the same type of assets, depending on how it is used.

2. **Accounting Depreciation**

This is more mechanical and is **driven largely by the aging of the asset**, with the differences often being in whether it happens **uniformly over the life of the asset or is more accelerated.**

3. **Tax Depreciation**

This reflects what the tax authorities will allow as **depreciation for purposes of computing taxable income.**

>**üìå SUMMARY: Economic** depreciation reflects **loss in value (earning power) in an asset, as it ages.** **Accounting** depreciation is **driven by the aging of an asset,** **depending** if it occurs **over the life time of the asset or in a more accelerated period.** **Tax** depreciation reflects **what authorities allow as depreciation** for purposes of **computing taxable income.**

Financial expenses

The most common financial expense is **interest expense on debt**, either in the form of bank loans or corporate bonds.

**Some interest expense is implicit**

As accountants classify other **commitments (such as leases) as debt, some of the interest expense is implicit**, i.e., it is calculated by accountants **based upon their assessment** of the **debt equivalent value of commitments and current interest rates.**

**If interest income exceeds interest expense, this number will measure net interest income.**

In some companies, **interest expenses are netted out against interest income earned by the company on its cash holdings** and **financial investments**, and **reported as a net interest expense**. If interest income exceeds interest expense, this number will measure net interest income.

>**üìå SUMMARY:** Most **common financial expense is interest expense on debt**, either **bank loans or corporate bonds.** Accountants classify **other commitments (leases etc.) as debt,** making some **interest  expense implicit and calculated based on their assessment of debt  equivalent value of commitments and current interest rates.** Some companies net out interest expense against interest income earned on cash holdings and financial investments. If **interest income exceeds interest expense, this number will measure net interest income.**

Income from non-operating investments

Income  earned from cash & marketable securities are reported different  then income earned from cross holdings in other companies.

**Cash & Marketable Securities**

**Income earned on cash holdings** (which is invested in marketable securities, like treasury bills and commercial paper in most companies) will be **reported either as a stand alone income or netted against interest expenses.**

**Cross holdings** in other companies

* Reporting can vary upon the magnitude of your holding:
* When you hold a (**small or minority**) portion of **another company,** the **income** from that holding will **usually be reported in the income statement.**
* If you hold a **majority stake of another company**, you will generally **have to consolidate your financials.** You will **count 100% of the subsidiary‚Äôs revenues,** **operating expenses and operating income as your own.**

>**üìå SUMMARY: Income earned** on **cash holdings** will be reported either as a s**tand alone income or netted against interest expenses. Income** earned from **minority stake** in a company will usually be reported in the **income statement.** If you hold a **majority  stake of another company, you will consolidate 100% of it's revenues,  operating expenses and operation income as your own.**

Extraordinary Income/Expenses

As the term implies, extraordinary income and expenses are designed to capture what a company **does not face in the ordinary course of operations.**

**Extraordinary** items include:

* **One-time expense or gain** from **sale of assets or divisions**
* **Write offs or charges** associated with **past project, lawsuits or fines**
* **Impairment of goodwill from acquisitions** in the **past**

**Truly extraordinary** items:

* If an item is **truly extraordinary**, it should show up **infrequently** and the amount associated with it **should vary**.

>**üìå SUMMARY: Extraordinary** items and expenses capture what a company **does not face in the ordinary course of operations**. If an item shows up **regularly and consistently, it is not extraordinary.**

Income Statement Analysis

There are **two** **methods** to read and analyze financial documents: **vertical and horizontal analysis.**

**Vertical Analysis**

This  method of analysis, as the name suggests, is top ‚Äì down. You look up  and down the income statement to see how each line compares to revenue  as a percentage.

This type of  analysis makes it simple to compare financial statements  across periods  and industries, and between companies, because you can  see relative  proportions. It also helps you analyze whether performance  metrics are  improving.

Vertical analysis isn‚Äôt  always as immediately useful as horizontal  analysis, but it can help  you determine what questions should be asked,  such as: *Where did costs rise or fall? What line items are contributing most to profit margins? How are they affected over time?*

**E.g** ‚Äì here we have the total dollar amounts and the percentages side by side

**Horizontal Analysis**

>***No images allowed on the sub, so here's a link:*** [*https://imgur.com/Zkgy21y*](https://imgur.com/Zkgy21y)

This method of analysis focuses on **year-over-year (YoY) or quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) performance.**

Horizontal  analysis makes financial data and reporting consistent per  generally  accepted accounting principles (GAAP). It improves the review  of a  company‚Äôs consistency over time, as well as its growth compared to   competitors.

Because of this,  horizontal analysis is important to investors and  analysts. By  conducting a horizontal analysis, you can tell what‚Äôs been  driving an  organization‚Äôs financial performance over the years and spot  trends and  growth patterns, line item by line item. Ultimately,  horizontal  analysis is used to identify trends over time‚Äîcomparisons  from Q1 to  Q2, for example‚Äîinstead of revealing how individual line  items relate  to others.

**To perform horizontal analysis you:**

1. Take the value of Period N
2. Divide it by the value of Period N-1
3. Subtract 1 from that number to obtain percentage change

>**E.g ‚Äì** ***Revenue in 2017 was $4,000 and in 2016 it was $3,000. The YoY change in revenue is $4000/$3000 ‚Äì 1 = 33%.***"

2021-05-26 11:19:04,stocks,"As a CPA, I would simply like to add a few things:

1) Economic depreciation are called impairment, I never saw a FS that used the term economic depreciation from my clients. Also, I have never heard the term in my accounting classes. That said, I did not audit all the entities publicly traded so that does not mean the term is never used. I just thought I might as well share the most common term. Furthermore, an entity will register an impairment when the accounting value is higher than the fair value (either the value on the market or the estimated value as per the cash flow. That said, most of the time the two values should be about the same). 

2) PP&E, other tangible assets and intangible assets will go directly in your BS. They won't appear in your P&L, unless you are talking about depreciation. (When you mention the capital expenses)

3) for extraordinary items, I would simply add that the entity has to present them distinctly in the P&L.

Great post though! As a CPA, that seems like basic information that everyone should know. I sometimes forget that not everyone knows this. If anyone has questions on the financial statements, feel free to post them on r/accounting. We don't bite, we just hate our jobs!"

2021-05-26 13:11:48,stocks,"Minor expansion on COGS - It's material components *and* direct labor costs. Material costs can also be estimated (e.g. 1 qt oil or 2 lbs of paint) and each individual product may have slight variations but it's the assumed average consumption over the annual production run. The larger the volume per year, the more stable this number becomes. These are also typically landed costs for materials so they *could* contain freight as well depending on how the standard valuation is measured.

The same goes for labor. If it takes 100 hours to make a product (assemble it for example) you take that against the direct costs of labor and bake that into the COGS of the product. Some companies have minor variations in what is included in this portion of COGS vs Operations Expense. 

All that said is to highlight that when reviewing manufacturing sheets you can't assume that COGS will travel 1:1 with upstream supply chain cost changes since there is a fixed amount of labor cost for that given fiscal year (for the most part.) It's important to note that price fluctuations generate variance in the costing model so some costs that may be normally attributable to COGS will slip into Operating Expense *and they may be negative.* (i.e. you got a better price than what you planned.)

TL;DR - COGS contains anything you can *directly attribute* to a specific unit of production (or batch) and therefore includes things like labor."

2021-05-26 12:43:13,stocks,"When analysts are reviewing these documents, it‚Äôs important to note the extraordinary items are often removed from the company‚Äôs reported EPS. That is, If a company reports $0.87 EPS and the analyst deems $0.07 related to extraordinary, then the adjusted EPS is $0.94. 

That‚Äôs getting into the analyst side of how to interpret these items. But as an accountant super important to understand the terminology. I also recommend reading the notes to financials to understand. The shareholder meeting should also be listened to as the executives sometimes use specific language that can tip you a certain way (tip I got from a former CFO of a publicly traded company)."

2021-05-26 13:31:31,stocks,"Economic depreciation isn't impairment. Impairment is when the fair value of an asset is lower than it's carrying value. So if you acquire a business and you put the goodwill of the business on the books, and for some reason all the customers leave, the FV of the business has probably dropped below the book value/carrying value which would mean the goodwill is impaired (this is just a simplified example).

Economic depreciation has come into more focus because of changes to tax depreciation. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 created immediate expensing of qualified property. So starting in 2018, a construction company could buy a dumptruck and for GAAP/financial reporting, the depreciable life would be 5 years. For tax, you could immediately expense it (effectively a 1 year life). However, the construction company takes good care of their trucks and will use that truck for 10 years. The economic depreciation in this sense would be 10 years, because that's how long the truck will actually contribute to the business before being fully replaced.

It's really more of a concept (from what I understand) when you are trying to understand the value of a companies' assets. If I bought that company in six years, there would be no net book value for that truck, but its still a valuable asset to me as a buyer that I will employ going forward."
2021-05-26 11:46:00,stocks,"Economist here, chiming in to nerd out with you. One aspect of my work is estimating 'economic depreciation' of utility assets for the measurement of total factor productivity. The economists I work with often use the term 'capital decay', which I think is synonymous to the accounting term 'impairment.' It's essentially the decline in asset efficiency over time and is completely distinct from accounting depreciation.

There are different stylized theoretical decay patterns for capital: geometric decay, hyperbolic, and one hoss shay. There's a nice, and very old, description of this stuff from Michael Harper at the BLS, 1982: [https://www.bls.gov/osmr/research-papers/1982/pdf/ec820020.pdf](https://www.bls.gov/osmr/research-papers/1982/pdf/ec820020.pdf). 

The goal, in calculating total factor productivity, is to ascertain the physical change in output given physical changes in input, as opposed to book value or accounting changes. For a simplified example, if your real, physical capital stock of electric distribution lines increase at a rate of 2% each year nationwide, but you're only serving 1% more customers, your productivity is falling by 1% annually. The estimation of that real capital stock for this analysis relies on the application of stylized patterns of capital decay across distribution assets.

None of this is necessarily relevant to the accounting world, or financial statement analysis...or really anything in this post. But it offers an example of how measurements of 'economic depreciation'/'impairment'/'capital decay' is used in the real world."

And I doubt US-GAAP are different in this matter. If you buy a machine that will produce 1M toys over its economical life, then you will depreciate it over 1M toy. i.e. if you produce 100k toys the first year, you will depreciate 1/10 of the cost. If you buy a truck and you expect to use it for 10 years, then you should depreciate it over its economical life expectancy. 10 years, not 5."
2021-05-26 12:11:11,stocks,"I'm not sure it is synonymous with impairment. Impairment is more of a one-time thing (of course, it can happen more than once).

What you're describing is more analogous to regular depreciation."
2021-05-26 13:44:00,stocks,"A lot of terms and concepts in economics do not apply to accounting. 

An economic perspective is more akin to a cash flow analysis whereas the accounting perspective tries to smooth everything out under an accrual perspective"
2021-05-26 15:31:11,stocks,"I think you're maybe conflating two separate things. The idea behind depreciation is to adhere to the matching principle in accounting which is based on matching expenses to use of those expenses. So for anything long term (more than one year), depreciation is a way to quantify the use of that asset over it's lifetime instead of expensing it all at once since the economic benefit derived from it is more than a short term timeline. 

Impairment is to prevent economic assets which the depreciation (or if it's an asset which has no fixed economic life) from being overstated, for instance large amounts of damage reduces the life of a piece of machinery, or an IP someone owned becomes toxic and is no longer worth what it was. 

It seems you're estimating utilization efficiency based output, which isn't an accounting measure, but more of an economic one. If I add more machines, does it become more difficult over time to keep productivity at the same levels as one machine for instance. Accounting is just really a measurement system, you can use what the financial statements say to create a model over time that gives you what you're looking at, but no financial statement metric measures that."
2021-05-26 14:46:33,stocks,"Mmmmh okay that would make sense. That is why OP also mentions tax depreciation even though it does not appear in the Income statement.

2021-05-26 16:03:14,stocks,"Well you set the useful life of the asset based on what you expect the useful life to be, but often assets can be disposed of sooner or leveraged longer than expected.

Obviously it depends on the stocks and how much money you put into them, but what I mean is: if a good investment stock looks like 10% growth per year, then is a realistic day trade more like 1% growth at the end of the day? I see some stocks on Webull that show 40% or even 100% growth after a few days, but I'm guessing that means it's no longer a good time to buy them if the point is to day trade. 

Apologies for the simplistic language! I'm on a pre-k level in the stock market and its lingo."

Im no finance magnate myself but I think realistically ur not looking at much more than 10% per year and thats with some moderate risk."

2021-05-26 10:32:42,stocks,"Depends what you mean by ""day trading"". Many people use this term as a synonym to mean different things.

If you mean buy underlying stock and sell it after it goes up at least 1% on the day, you're to lose money over time. Nobody can predict the future, and nobody knows which way a stock will move on any particular day. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. Putting money into a few stocks and hoping they go up on the day is no better than going to the casino and hoping the roulette wheel falls on black. You might hit, and you might hit a streak for a while, but anyone who has studied this can tell you that, statistically, you will not outperform the market over time.

Conversely, if by ""day trading"" you mean having a lot of call/put spreads that require you to enter, roll, and close (i.e. manage) your position on a daily basis because you are adequately leveraged across dozens of stocks across many sectors, then yes you can make a reasonable and safe return on your investment on a daily basis. However, you'll need at least $1m in principal before you can make enough to replace an $80k-$100k/year full-time employment. You'll also need a great deal of patience, which most people like to think they have, but when shit really hits the fan on red days, most people don't exercise patience.

If you are trying to actually make your daily bread with it it is VERY hard. What do you do when you have a losing week and the mortgage is due and the baby needs shoes.  It's easy to make mistakes and over stress.

You can make yourself miserable and destitute.

90%+ people day trading lose money. Google it. And to top that off, the set of the small percentage of people who make money are constantly changing. In other words, sometimes you can get lucky, but you can‚Äôt sustain it. It‚Äôs not a job, and it‚Äôs not a stable source of income.

I haven't taken a loss trading with this group. I've had days where I made $100 in 6 hours, and I've had days where I made $1200 in 1 hour. It's not for the faint hearted, but is very manageable as long as you trade within your comfort zone. If you risk too much in a single trade, you'll do dumb things like pull out too early. It's natural. Find a group and find your tolerance. Just know that it is very real and I've made more money in 1 month of daytrading than many people will return all year.

2021-05-26 10:59:56,stocks,Talking to people around you is huge. My coworker talked about how golf equipment is more expensive than it was last year so I looked at Callaways stock and the price went from $17 to $36 in 6 months. Had no clue to ever look there but one conversation made me look.

2021-05-26 11:13:50,stocks,"As someone who has avoided most of the GME/AMC/etc convo, can someone explain whether this magical date where GME is supposed to rocket is a complete fantasy or if it based any part in truth? It‚Äôs odd to see a comment expressing that in r/stocks and see it upvoted but then there‚Äôs a lot of comments saying these people are delusional.

How does the common man read into whether a massive group of trolls are supporting each other‚Äôs fantasy or if the normal investor like myself is just misunderstanding and poised to miss out?"
2021-05-26 16:39:05,stocks,"Investing in AMC is a huge risk as the company was bleeding funds pre-COVID and, most likely, will continue to do so post-COVID. As of the latest update, AMC'S cash burn amounts to $400M per quarter. Equity dilution has been substantial given their need to raise capital every few months during the pandemic just to survive. Barring a miracle, bankruptcy seems inevitable sometime in the future."
2021-05-26 08:45:02,stocks,Hmm. Pretty interesting premarket for the brick and mortar gaming retail store. If it hits 250 it'll be interesting to see everyone react lol

The pharma company has continued to produce incredible results on market leading health advances. Their board is made up for proven leaders who have had 1000's of companies in the pharma space bought out. I say it is only a matter of time AND most likely this recent pull back is an anticipation of a big acquisition.

2021-05-26 16:22:01,stocks,"The original post was removed, but so far it's been following [this](https://www.reddit.com/user/tickerwizards/comments/nk994x/gme_updates_mods_deleted_wsb_post/) perfectly. TLDR we're probably on track for hitting 275, and hopefully 348"
2021-05-26 12:10:07,stocks,"There is no magical date. The theory present here is that short sellers never covered in January, but instead thought they could wait out retail investors. Within this theory is the SI% reporting loop, where every T+21 days and T+35 days of initial options selling/buying that failures-to-deliver have to be covered. Over this cycle on these days, the price has seen intra day increases followed by sharp decreases. Monday and Tuesday were two consecutive days of the SI% loop and price increases were seen on both days, falling in line with the theory. 

In addition to this, one of the people responsible for designing high frequency trading systems, David Lauer, has shared information that the steep price declines in January and March from around ~$500 and ~$325ish, respectively, were highly suspect of being flash crashes. From here, other industry professionals, such as Susanne Trimbath, Carl Hagberg, and Wes Christian (a lawyer who helped pen Reg SHO) have added their opinions and knowledge on this matter. All of them have some belief that GME has seen abusive naked short selling. Carl Hagberg, who has made a career out of stock ownership programs and voting rights, believes strongly that GME has been sold significantly beyond the available shares. Wes Christian also kindly provided previous cases from suits against firms that revealed most firms either purposely ignore Reg SHO, or don't care enough to design systems capable of properly tracking and reconciling naked shorts. In many of these cases, short sales were either mismarked as long sales - especially in ETFs. 

There are many people at GME and Superstonk that make it an echo chamber, but within it is some very valid information. The idea of the $20M floor is not literal (or at least most people don't consider it literally), but rather it gives the idea that, if enough people don't sell, GME can theoretically turn into a financial black hole. 


I'm not going to tell you to buy into GME. Instead, read this https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/nletnn/gme_the_mother_of_all_short_squeezes_moass_thesis/ and decide for yourself."
2021-05-26 13:09:58,stocks,"Okay, first up, anyone telling you with complete confidence the reason for something happening due to this or that in GME/AMC is completely delusional. Yes I said that, completely delusional just like the ""cultists"" they like to call those over in superstonk or gme subreddits.

It essentially boils down to this thesis, which is:
""Did the shorts cover in January?""

If you read the explanation by the other comment, I find it very plausible that they didn't. But not everyone thinks the same way for whatever reasons.

So choose which you believe. I will be completely honest, no one knows how it will play out, and anyone confidently telling you otherwise isn't to be fully trusted.

But of course, here is a little bias from my own opinion.

Would you trust an unknown stranger on reddit who probably isn't even a millionaire, or would you trust a sub (no matter how cult like it may seem) that has tons of people dedicating their time to looking through every single piece of information they can about validating their theory, and even have certified professionals amongst them who are on board and understands about the fuckery of some bad actors in the market? 

Even if some DD is filled with misinformation, the core idea is still there. It's just that people are so hung up on the mistakes, they fail the see the overarching point of a DD that is made. (The analogy of the make one mistake and everyone points it out)"
2021-05-26 11:29:24,stocks,"they link to each other to gang upvote posts in other investing subs.
There is definitely a retail swarm but I don't think any dates matter in particular"
2021-05-26 11:28:56,stocks,"Complete fantasy, it's literally a bunch of cult members convincing each other they're going to get rich fast and easily. 

Check out /r/superstonk or /r/amcstock and it's quite obvious it's a cult. 

They're not really trolls by any means, just literal morons.

I wouldn't FOMO into these stocks. AMC especially is dead on a fundamental level.

Edit: hahah the cult is ganging up on the nay sayer. Both comments from frequent superstonk commenters. Hilarious."
2021-05-26 11:56:35,stocks,"People are just betting big on the next earnings date mostly. It's GME so, no one knows what will happen over the next few weeks."
2021-05-26 15:50:46,stocks,"Risky, yes. Volatile, yes. I think that if you are a super long term and want to play the sector, then that is probably one of the best ways to do so. I personally don‚Äôt think the industry will catch traction for a little while.

2021-05-26 19:53:28,stocks,"Interesting, thanks for the link. My only question I‚Äôm left with is where will the $ come from for the short sellers to close out their positions at these high prices? Let‚Äôs not use the $20 million number, let‚Äôs even say a reasonable $1500/share...when I do the math on that, that‚Äôs an insane amount of money. Wouldn‚Äôt they go bankrupt before being able to meet their positions and leave GME hopefuls holding nothing?

If I trade on margin and make some stupid decisions and lose it all, I owe the brokerage but with no way to pay them. Not such a big deal when I‚Äôm a low percentage of investors. However when a huge % of those who hold positions can‚Äôt physically cover- what happens then?

Does that make sense?"

Acting like those subs aren't just a large collection of non-millionaire unknown reddit strangers is quite odd. I do love the fact you have to disclaim it seems like a cult though lmfao, I wonder why... Can't be because it is a cult!"

2021-05-26 14:15:12,stocks,"Well, if that's all you can care to dispute about, maybe you should rethink your life choices. It's all in individual biases anyway. You don't like my biases, then go on and tell the guy. No need to come here throwing the word cult around here like it's a big thing. It speaks volumes of your mental age.

Edit: so what if I have a disclaimer that's it's cult-like? Does it matter? Is that the main point of my comment?"
2021-05-26 00:00:00,stocks,"Trying to understand options Say I‚Äôm doing a call on AMC for $19 and the date is may 28th, that means that I want to buy this if I have a good feeling that it will hit $19 by may 28th, right?

The call also says it costs 74 cents. So I have to multiply that by 100, so it costs me $74 for the call. Is the $74 like the cost for the option? Meaning you don‚Äôt get that money back?

Also, if it does hit $19 and the price is currently $17.05, does that mean I get the 100 shares for $17.05 each?

I know these are basic questions but I have watched a few videos and did some reading and want to make sure I am understanding correctly.

Thanks!"
2021-05-26 06:24:43,stocks,No you will buy them for 19$ each - youre bet is its higher than 19 so you buy it cheaper than current price
2021-05-26 08:45:48,stocks,"While the info here is good, before you buy options, you should learn to use http://optionsprofitcalculator.com to make sure you have everything you need to know to make a good decision. Additionally, you would be really wise to watch inthemoney on YouTube for some really good info on options trading. I suggest his recent video on LEAPS and an older video, I think it's ""how to trade options on Robinhood"" (a more recent one on WeBull exists too, but the RH one goes into more detail. They really aren't so much broker specific, just what was popular at the time. Great detail either way)

Good luck getting to know options!"
2021-05-26 08:41:50,stocks,"The calls cost $74 a piece, and give you the right to but 100 shares at $19/share for ($1900). But, since the calls cost $0.74/share you need AMC to go over $19.74/share by May 28th to make a profit.

If AMC drops today, your call will lose value as it becomes less likely that $19/share will be reached by Friday. Your $74 might become $45.

Conversely, if AMC rises to $19 today, you call will probably go from $74 to $125. I‚Äôm assuming you don‚Äôt want to actually buy 100 shares though, so if you get a price pop, sell the option back to the market"
2021-05-26 09:11:18,stocks,"Ok, so people pretty much never actually exercise their options; they sell their option for market its value.

This also means that even though your option is OTM you can sell it for a profit assuming the contracts are worth more than when you bought them."
2021-05-26 11:08:10,stocks,"You need to understand what calls/puts are first.

You are buying contracts that let you buy (sell) the stock at an agreed upon price (the strike) up until the agreed upon date (expiry). They are called derivatives because their value is derived from the price of the underlying equity these contracts denote. 

The total value of an option is the sum of its intrinsic and extrinsic values. It's intrinsic value is the different between the strike and the current price of the stock (spot price) with a minimum of 0. The extrinsic value is the value the option gets from the time left to expiry (high chance of movement and being profitable - in the money) and the volatility of the stock.

&#x200B;

Lets do an example:

Today is March 1st. 

Stock XYZ is trading for $100.

You buy 10 lots of calls on stock XYZ with strike of $120 and expiry of May 1st. The premium is $0.30.

You pay $0.30 \* 100 (each lot is for 100 shares) \* 10 (lots) = $300.00

You calls intrinsic value is $0 because your strike price is above the spot price.

The extrinsic value is $300 - all of the value of your calls is derived from the chance that 

You now own those calls that let you buy 1000 (10 \* 100) shares of XYZ by May 1st, for $120.

It is now April 1st. 

XYZ is trading for $130.

The value of your contracts is still intrinsic + extrinsic.

The intrinsic part is now $10 \* 10 \* 100 = $10,000.

The extrinsic part would be the volatility + time value.

If the volatility stayed the same, then the extrinsic would be around 1/2 (there were 2 months to expiry when you bought the calls, and one month left now).

So your options would be worth around $10,150.

You can sell those options, or you can exercise them and force the counter-party that underwrote them to sell you 10 \* 100 XYZ for $120.

&#x200B;

Hope that makes some sense."
2021-05-26 06:33:13,stocks,99% of people sell to close the option and dont get it exercised. Start looking at the Greeks to understand how even if things are going your way you can still lose money.
2021-05-26 09:15:46,stocks,"A call option is the right (but not obligation) to buy stock at a certain price by a certain date. A put option is the right (but not obligation) to sell a stock by a certain date at a certain price. The price in question is called the ""strike price"" and the date in question is called the ""expiration date."" The typical expiration for a month is the third Friday.

So buying a $19 June call confers the right to buy the underlying stock for $19 at any point of time before June 18.

In your earlier example, the $0.74 is called the ""premium"", and is the amount you're paying for this right."
2021-05-26 06:21:28,stocks,"You got almost all of that correct!
The only thing is that if you have a $19.00 call and it hits $19.01+ then your option is in the money (the strike price per share is under market value). Say we gamma squeeze and it shoots up to $100/share on the 27th or early 28th. You have the option to purchase the 100 shares (the single one option) at $19/share which would be a STEAL. Or say you don't have the cash to exercise the option you can sell the right to the option and collect the difference between the market price and the strike price. Also, you are correct that it would be $74 for the option that you paid to the owner. He keeps that money. Good call on the call. See you on the moon Ape!"

2021-05-26 08:46:31,stocks,$74 is the most you can lose if you buy just 1 contract. But you‚Äôll only lose it all if you let the option expire worthless on Friday if AMC closes the week at $18.50/share.
2021-05-26 18:28:27,stocks,This guy probably had a good day if he bought those Monday or Tuesday
2021-05-26 15:06:26,stocks,"Most pieces of an options price are known. The DTE, the strike, and the price and history of the underlying. However, the future volatility of the underlying is unknown, and influences the price of an option. If you own an OTM put that is increasing in value as the price of the underlying moves against you, the market believes the price of the underlying will be more volatile in the future."
2021-05-26 06:55:32,stocks,Someone else will want the deal you currently have (say an ITM strike of $19 when the market price of AMC is $85) it would only cost someone $1900 to buy 100 shares of AMC with the contract where it would cost the same person $8500 to buy 100 shares at market price. If you sell the underlying option to someone so they can exercise the option and buy the 100 shares on the cheap YOU make the difference between $19 and $85. In this scenario that means you just made $66 dollars per share x 100 (number of shares in an option) for a grand total of $6600 from your $74 trade.

2021-05-26 11:56:58,stocks,I bought TTD when it fell off a cliff and it's coming back quickly.
2021-05-26 12:12:41,stocks,"Same I knew the opportunity was too great, granted I've been bullish on PTON for over a year now, grabbed it luckily literally timed at $83 during that tip, and looking back, only wish I grabbed more, granted I had to hold cash in the case it actually dipped below $80, so at this point really just greed lol."
2021-05-26 12:13:28,stocks,Same
2021-05-26 11:54:25,stocks,"If you wanted to make twenty percent you could've picked dozens of better things, don't let yourself confuse luck for skill. And not necessarily only high risk growth stocks, ever heard of Ford? 

If not for this little pop that literally every other NASDAQ stock is getting, Peloton would be a below average return for you instead of completely average. Do your due diligence and don't rely on an irrational (but delicious) rally day to retroactively compare your cost basis. That's walnut level thinking"
2021-05-26 13:00:23,stocks,Small children would beg to differ.
2021-05-26 13:54:16,stocks,As someone that bought around 140 I'm pretty disappointed.
2021-05-26 17:08:49,stocks,"I don‚Äôt pay careful attention to stocks after I sell them, it‚Äôs too much of a ‚Äúlook at the $$ you could have made!‚Äù most of the time. I sold AMC at 14 for a 10% profit, my normal time to exit. I only look if there is a major dip to see if I should buy again."
2021-05-26 16:44:00,stocks,"Same, sold at 13, but still profited"
2021-05-26 15:42:16,stocks,Bill Gates foundation selling and bought CPNG

2021-05-26 15:07:59,stocks,There down 2.2 billion today
2021-05-26 08:47:07,stocks,"Same as the pound, I'm down on some stocks just from the currency loss. Long term it doesn't matter because gains will likely be far greater but still."
2021-05-26 08:57:55,stocks,"Echoing the short term frustration from the pound's perspective, but I'm looking at 30+ years into the future at least.  Maybe the rate works against me for 27 years but then it falls in the last 3, and everything I bought at an unfavourable rate suddenly leaps in value?

Stronger euro = more buying power
Stronger dollar = more selling power

Long term marker gains will probably outpace a weakening dollar anyway, and you never know when it could turn back the other way."
2021-05-26 08:17:57,stocks,"Same problem here as a Canadian, and unfortunately i expect it to get worse. With all this money printing, and the US economy roaring, i expect the US dollar to keep weakening.


My solution has been to invest a good % of my money in VSP.TO, which is essentially VOO but with canadian dollar hedge.


Europeans may consider something like IUSE"
2021-05-26 09:24:05,stocks,Ya had to jinx it‚Ä¶ futures just nose dived
2021-05-26 16:26:59,stocks,"for a second, i thought you meant 4 digit percentage.

2021-05-26 10:38:55,stocks,Meme stonk go squeeze
2021-05-26 11:15:27,stocks,Right at my cost basis of 9.40. Tempted to sell out now
2021-05-26 13:25:43,stocks,"what's more painful; actually losing real money, or dreaming about something that could've happened"
2021-05-26 13:00:51,stocks,DKNG undercut my stop by literally a penny on Monday and is now up like 15% since then lol. feels bad man
2021-05-26 13:07:41,stocks,"Stock down 10% because I am actually losing money instead of just daydreaming about what ifs.

Real losses are always worse than imaginary gains."
2021-05-26 13:14:06,stocks,"This is why I buy at least 1 stock of anything I am remotely interested in anyway. If you're low conviction and not no conviction on something, own a very tiny amount at least."

2021-05-26 13:19:43,stocks,I'm going to go in on a few shares. Been wearing their scrubs for years and have nothing but positive things to say about the company and product. Most of my hospital coworkers wear them as well.
2021-05-26 12:50:26,stocks,What does they sell?
2021-05-26 14:50:35,stocks,There‚Äôs just as dumb as us!
2021-05-26 14:59:13,stocks,"Excuse my ignorance, but what are you referring to?"
2021-05-26 15:41:45,stocks,"Its soared like crazy over the past year+ though. How much more can it really still have in its tank?

And what happens if/when they pass laws that allow farmers to repair their JD equipment other than JD dealerships? Its insane they're allowed to mandate that"
2021-05-26 15:48:34,stocks,Mind sharing your bull thesis on it?

2021-05-26 09:03:38,stocks,"Backtest it and see how it goes, gonna be hard to avoid bias though"
2021-05-26 11:22:49,stocks,"Trading bounces and crosses around the 50 ma is very popular in trend or swing trading, although with swing trading you typically want to take some profits earlier. Like the other guy said, backtest it and see if you can find similarities in the stocks that rose."
2021-05-26 10:02:58,stocks,Hasn‚Äôt really moved much. I bought them at 134 in September
2021-05-26 10:17:02,stocks,Been super laggy these past 6 months. But holding long and strong I guess.
2021-05-26 12:27:29,stocks,Slow and steady wins the race
2021-05-26 10:36:43,stocks,Taxes are the biggest downside. Factor that in before selling. If you can hold them for a year you'll avoid paying as much.
2021-05-26 11:24:01,stocks,"Congrats, if it's a large portion of your portfolio, and you're in long term gains, then yes you should sell.

Keep in mind theres been at least one time in my life where I didnt believe in a company post IPO and uh it doubled past where I had options so... Maybe keep some just in case as a risky hedge."
2021-05-26 11:17:22,stocks,"Get a financial advisor if it‚Äôs a significant amount of money, not reddit. Congrats on the IPO."

2021-05-26 13:13:43,stocks,He always acts like that. He's kind of a prick imo.
2021-05-26 15:11:54,stocks,What happened? Been trying to find a link
2021-05-26 11:14:32,stocks,"I feel like this is how people really lose money. Fundamentals caused a sell-off, then a little irrational exuberance *almost* recoups some of those steep sell-off's -- just enough to get people to FOMO into the same stocks that were the sell-off's focal.

We're essentially one errant ""taper"" away in the FOMC minutes from another NASDAQ implosion. People think crashes are one directional, but even Morgan Stanley hit a year high on a +10% May rally months after Countrywide & the subprime mortgage market's problems tanked their stock in 2008. Then, of course, it went right back to the basement and dug itself a nice hole"

2021-05-26 06:57:44,stocks,April 1999 was around 105$ as the dotcom bubble burst and the fear of terror depressed the price to 6$ in November 2001. The company was just a bookstore and the time and extremely overvalued due to all the internet hype.
2021-05-26 06:34:00,stocks,Watch graph from 2000 to 2002 and U'll see 100 to 6. But idk if there was a dilution or anything

2021-05-26 19:21:19,stocks,For wall street too.    Using loss leaders to get fresh dumb money into the market is a smart play.   Especially when they can use the house (our) money to do it eh guys?
2021-05-26 19:50:22,stocks,Order some pizza for delivery and it's a perfect way to celebrate the end of a great green day

2021-05-26 15:26:05,stocks,I predicted the upward movement on F and still hesitated to buy the call options I was looking at. Would have doubled my money today alone.
2021-05-26 14:13:20,stocks,Same‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs too green for me. Since Monday is Memorial Day I‚Äôm planning on buying stuff on Friday before close and hope that it‚Äôs red then.
2021-05-26 14:31:55,stocks,I added to my micron position yesterday.  I think the 3% drop on the news of a possible flat quarter was an over reaction when taking into account I'm long on it 3-5 years.

2021-05-26 13:20:40,stocks,I'm pretty immune to what ifs at this point. I've watched the meme stock of the year since the beginning of January. I could have made boat loads somehow playing that right. I could have been a bag holder playing it wrong. I have sat out the entire time. Oh well. There are millions of ways to make money in life I'll focus on the ones I actually choose.

2021-05-26 16:16:40,stocks,"He was systematically barking at every panelist, and being aggressive about it, interrupting, badgering, and getting way too personal.   

Joe Teranova got snapped at for saying he wanted to add a point about Chevron.  Wapner stopped him and said current stock only or nothing.  Joe just shook his head incredulously and stared for a bit, made even more awkward by the transmission delay.  He was reaming on Tony Saganaki, who is fairly humble and self-deprecating most of the time.  

It reached a point where Jim Cramer went on set and mic'd up to step in and defend Tony's character, if not his thesis.   Wapner then said if Tony can't defend himself on the topic, he shouldn't be there.  Tony gave up and just said he's done.  He eventually did make a closing statement but he was indeed gone after the cut.

I don't really get what's going on with some of these hosts.  

Yes, we know Joe Kernan is an intolerable and intolerant old bugger.  But John Fortt and Wilfred Frost seem to be manifesting aggression where it's not needed.  Wapner, who isn't always like this, really went too far.  

They need to model Brian Sullivan and Melissa Lee, who know how to disagree without being disagreeable.  Financial news coverage is already sort of grossly favorable to institutions and dismissive of retail, but being aggressive in this way is not how to improve that imbalance."
2021-05-26 11:23:30,stocks,"It interesting how the same stocks that were called overvalued last week are being pushed up 5-10% today. It is as if the media and people only say the bear cases when stocks are tanking but when they going up day after day valuations go out the window.

2021-05-26 12:45:51,stocks,premiums are absolute trash for the $25 strike. PLTR seems to be on the move so there's a risk of selling a $25 call too early for low premium. If it sky rockets to $25 next week then buying back my calls would be too expensive. I could just let myself get assigned at $25 which I'm fine with but what if the price drops below $25 and tanks to $21 again then I don't get assigned and I miss my opportunity to offload my shares ar break even after all these months.

2021-05-26 12:01:26,stocks,"I think there's a pretty big difference between thinking inflation is ""cancelled"" and recouping a fractional amount of losses after a big sell-off. NASDAQ is still ~600 points off its ATH.

The week by week sort of obscures it, but it's a fairly straight correlation that Treasury yields rose, NASDAQ sold off, and now that Treasury yields took a pause so did the sell-off. But unless you think Treasury yields are actually going to *go back down* then no, inflation isn't cancelled because objectively it hasn't been and it also means stocks are not going back to their ATHs any time soon.

In hindsight it had looked off before then, and then memapalooza set off it taking a beatdown."

2021-05-26 00:00:00,stocks,"What's your thought on ICLN for long term? As the title says I'm really interested in your thought about this ETF? I don't see it (or other sustainable energy stocks/ETF's) mentioned here a lot. Maybe I'm not reading correctly. I see a lot of potential in etf's like these since I really think we're heading into a sustainable world. What's your take?

I've bought this etf for the first time when it was sitting at around 15. It's been decreasing since that point all the way to around 10 euro's. I kept averaging down until now at 10.XX. still buying more and hoping it's a good one for the long run! 

How much risk is there involved from your perspective?"
2021-05-26 05:25:22,stocks,"Holding some on the London listed version for the long haul as well. From my understanding they were overweight on a few companies like PLUG that has dragged then down recently but have rebalanced since. There is also an overall risk that renewable energy companies in general are overpriced even currently however. 

My view on it was that I don't understand renewables enough to buy individual companies. ICLN is more diversified geographically than most other renewable ETFs and so I feel more comfortable with a set and forget approach on it, my horizon on it is well over 5 years and likely more than 10 unless the management of it changes in such a way that I want to get out. 

Others will likely have a more informed opinion."
2021-05-26 06:02:14,stocks,"I am in QCLN and in exactly the same boat. I bought at ATH \~90$ as I had just started in the market and didn't know how overweight the green stocks all were. TSLA, NIO and Plug are big holdings that drove it to where it was, but now are the ones weighing it down around 60$.

It was always a long term hold, but I wish I had jumped in a month later as I think the entry point in either one right now is pretty good."
2021-05-26 08:21:51,stocks,"PBW was often touted as a better fund than ICLN, as was QCLN in a number of subs. PBW peaked at $138 a few months back and has dropped 43% since. QCLN has seen a sizable drop since its ATH as well. I think a lot of people jumped in once Biden got elected thinking the green push would come swift and fast. PLUG also dragged this thing down - PLUG itself saw a 62% drop after its ATH. Now that PLUG's weight has dropped in the fund (from 9.5% down to 4%), it should be more stable and perform better."
2021-05-26 08:53:04,stocks,We‚Äôve seen growth really out of favor this year which has caused ICLN to underperform. Concerns are many of the companies aren‚Äôt profitable yet. With that being said it‚Äôs obvious clean energy is the future. There has been big advancements in the tech so far but imo there is still long way to go. We will most likely see consolidation in the clean energy space over the the top 5-10yrs-mergers and acquisition for economies of scale. It wouldn‚Äôt surprise me either is some of these green companies end up being acquired by traditional energy companies.  I‚Äôd much rather own this ETF than an individual stock right now due to these reasons.
2021-05-26 07:37:36,stocks,"I‚Äôm pretty deep into renewables and do climate science research. If we want to keep a semistable climate, we have to move away from fossil fuels to alternative energy sources as rapidly as possible. The IEA just released a report that says if we want to keep warming under 1.5C, we have to stop all new oil and gas development. We can already see the acute symptoms of our climate crisis and those are only going to get worse. If we move away from fossil fuels, where are we going to get our energy from? 

Renewable focused funds are going to do well in the next 10-20 years because we have to shift into those sectors to solve this crisis."
2021-05-26 06:23:01,stocks,I'm buying this for a period of 20 years. In that timeframe I would say the energy transition is going to be the biggest problem we face as humanity. It's a bit of a 'bang or bust' scenario for me.
2021-05-26 06:29:44,stocks,"I believe it to be a safe and solid investment. Currently selling some calls on my shares but they don't bring in a ton of premium. This is the type of position that I hope to pass down to my children and grandchildren, currently holding 1k shares."

2021-05-26 10:29:33,stocks,"I hold INRG which is basically the same. Took a decent-sized bath on it, so I'm holding. Sadly a lot of the uplift was tied into the madness around Plug Power's sky high valuation and its heavy weighting in the ETF. 

I'm not sure we're going to see the levels we reached at the beginning of the year for a while and have a sinking feeling that we are in a reversion to the mean stage, which will mean more losses

That said the wider basket of companies is good and long term renewable energy is only going to become more important, so it has a high chance of capturing some high value companies in the new list of 80 or so."
2021-05-26 10:33:17,stocks,I bought ICLN under the assumption it‚Äôs be a good long term hold with a Biden presidency. Only tossed $90 at it and bought 3 shares. It‚Äôs done nothing but decline and it made me realize I shouldn‚Äôt buy sectors on speculation. It affirmed that I should stick to my 3 fund portfolio strategy. Thanks r/bogleheads
2021-05-26 06:04:55,stocks,I got alot of it when it was as going up. Lost alot now that it dropped. Going to hold on and see. Renewable seems promising from BEP is more reliable.
2021-05-26 14:48:06,stocks,"People are mentioning the rebalancing and PLUG. That wasn't just a rebalancing, it was a major change not in the etf itself but in the clean energy index it's tracking. The index wqs completely overhauled. ETF manager has to comply to some rules set by the index it's following. As it's a full replication etf, Black Rock had to buy stocks and during the ""rebalancing"" sell positions to comply with the new index rules and company weighting. Had to sell millions of Plug shares as well. That's why it's plummeted so hard, not only because of accounting mistakes.

Now about the index and etf. It had 30 100% hreen energy companies, now it has 80+ not only pure clean energy but related companies, etc. PLUG which was a heaviest holding and a major drag down lost half of it's weight, etc.

Go to Black Rock site, fond the fact sheet of the ICLN/INRG. All the data about the etf overhaul is the and explained in detail.

The etf lost a lot, but I believe it's a good entry point. Although it lacks backwind as Biden is too quiet about all the climate stuff. We need it back on the table. Hopefully after infrastructure project is done."
2021-05-26 14:51:00,stocks,"I bought a few shares because I wanted to start incentivizing green/renewable production. Luckily I bought in pretty low. Idk, it's gone down and back up and I'm back in the green on what I've put in, and I plan to just leave the money in there because - like others have said - I kind of expect it to be the only energy in the future.

Not financial advice and etc."
2021-05-26 10:36:32,stocks,"I've owned PBW and ICLN since 2018. I highly recommend PBW over ICLN personally, but invest as you wish. I have been buying more ever since as well"
2021-05-26 05:51:26,stocks,"I like it. Haven't done a deep dive but so far, it makes sense to me"
2021-05-26 08:52:21,stocks,I dropped it because they were like WAY overweight in Enphase and PLUG and we all know how those stocks did for a good while this year
2021-05-26 09:51:57,stocks,I just sold mine for a big loss
2021-05-26 06:09:47,stocks,It‚Äôs a good etf. I‚Äôm not in it as there are better opportunities for your money currently but ICLN is a 15+ year hold before it does anything significant
2021-05-26 09:38:07,stocks,"Back in 2008 it was pumped up to $50 and dumped down to $8-$10 and stayed there for about 10 years.

Same thing is likely to happen again IMO, but this time it went up like $35 or whatever the top was."
2021-05-26 06:43:15,stocks,"When you look at the stocks making up the ETF, i can't see why any of them would be successful.   When the green energy things start happening for real,  these aren't going to be the winning picks.   The real winners are going to be the same giants that the government always picks.   GE, Siemens,  Oshkosh,  the major utilities,  etc.  There small green companies aren't going to be able to win against the big players.   There was enough of an uproar over a small company getting the contract to rebuild Puerto Rico electric grid after the hurricane destroyed it, governments will only contract with the majors.  See what happened with the postal service contract.  That's the way it works."
2021-05-26 10:00:41,stocks,"Green energy will pay out in decades not years. Most of the listing that make up ICLN are very overweighted. I imagine its going to continue to drop for a couple more years before we see a slow, long, steady rise"

2021-05-26 06:06:51,stocks,"Yes interesting! Do you know why PLUG went down so much? I've heard indeed that they were too heavy invested in it.

I agree about the knowledge on individual stocks. It's not that 1 company wins it all, more like a whole industry or sector. Exactly the reason I went for this as well! Let's hope it'll play out in the good run üëåüèº"
2021-05-26 06:07:36,stocks,Yes makes sense! However you can always average down on the current price if you have the funds and willing to do so!
2021-05-26 12:43:14,stocks,Very interesting! I've heard about the QCLN but not about that other one. Makes sense for an ETF to drop a stock or at least reduce the stake when it doesn't perform well
2021-05-26 12:45:14,stocks,Yes I can't agree more with you! The fact that most of this technology/trend/way of living is fairly new it's very difficult to say which companies will make it a d which won't. That's why I chose this as my ETF pick. I also got some small holdings in SolarEdge just to see where it's going

2021-05-26 06:15:52,stocks,Overhyped and made up too large a chunk of the ETF so affected price excessively. They work with the likes of Amazon and Walmart so that is attractive on the surface but losses have widened significantly and they have had to restate financials.

2021-05-26 06:36:13,stocks,"Plug is way too overvalued atm. And with their latest financial results it was clear that it wasn‚Äôt all that great. So they will have to gain more credibility in the coming years, showing that their hydrogen batteries can make a big difference in the market.

2021-05-26 09:08:31,stocks,"That‚Äôs terrible DD.

The last green wave in 2008 had the same message.  ICLN was $50. It then crashed completely and even with this crazy run the past 12 months barely recovered to half that value.  

You can justify ICLN as necessary, but many others see a basket of companies that are in a highly competitive, high capital, low margin, low/no cash flows, low moat industry that is also currently undergoing disruption.  Yes, some of these companies have great ideas, but as we pivot away from fossil fuels, it‚Äôs very likely these current technologies get disrupted themselves.  Given the previous statement about the industry, it‚Äôs very possible many perform poorly or go bankrupt even with a few winners.

If you want to invest in renewables, stay out of the fray and invest in electrical transmission companies or raw material miners,

I fully expect ICLN to drop a further 50% from here once interest rates normalize"

2021-05-26 00:00:00,stocks,"Investment into nuclear fusion? I was doing some more research on fusion for the first time in years. Im bullish on the future of fusion reactors for multitude of factors. 

How can I invest into this ? Will ITER ever go public? Or is there a better way to invest in fusion? Aka general fusion. Im from canada so I was looking into this. This is also a private company. I dont know how to invest in start ups but would like to open a large position the earlier the better. And yes I'm prepared to hodl for 30 years I am young . Thanks to everyone and anyone who takes time to reply :) hagd"
2021-05-26 04:57:52,stocks,"ITER is not yet complete. Given that commercial fusion will be at least 10 years after it is, your looking at least 15-25 years barring any major breakthroughs. It's planned first operation is 2035 and that's literally the first operation reaction.

The world's first fission station, Calder Hall in the UK, was commsioned in 1956. So assuming that fusion is on the same timescale your looking at mid 2040s probably. That is also assuming you can even invest. ITER is in France, where the energy company is state owned (84.5%) meaning that initally you won't be able to invest in fusuon in europe at all.

The US can forget about it, that said they are currently involved in the coalition of countries contributing to ITER. So they will at least have access to the technology.

It will be a long time before retail investors can touch fusion."
2021-05-26 07:12:04,stocks,"Try looking at [ITERs subcontractors](https://www.iter.org/mach/Manufacturing). They're a bit hidden, but i'm sure you can find some. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries for example.

These are the companies with most experience in building components for fusion."
2021-05-26 04:47:53,stocks,Your thinking is correct in that fusion will be absolutely massive one day but as for now I think it's too early.
2021-05-26 07:39:53,stocks,Nuclear physicist here. Don't. You're welcome!
2021-05-26 08:01:17,stocks,What are your thoughts on Commonwealth Fusion Systems?
2021-05-26 09:55:49,stocks,"You can compare it to nuclear fission. The technology is incredibly complex, so once you start building a plant it takes about 8-20 years for it to come online. Nuclear fusion will be the same, so basically you can forget about investing in it and start investigating it again once they solve it and you'll still have at least 8 years before they start doing the first revenue."
2021-05-26 10:59:55,stocks,"The only reason to invest in fusion is if you intend to live well into the next century and even that that may not be enough time.  ITER is a proof of concept project that by the time it reaches a conclusion will have taken sixty years of design, construction, and experimentation.  It may not even work or may require a subsequent project using what was learned.  Fusion is a looong way off."
2021-05-26 12:22:41,stocks,"As a fusion researcher, I don't know of any good ways for an average investor to invest in our field. Research projects, like ITER, are government/internationally funded labs. They will never generate revenue, the knowledge that they generate will be public knowledge,  and they will never go public. 

The private companies doing research are largely funded by a mixture of venture capital and government funds. If you're wealthy, then you could get in on the venture capital. But the quality of research that private companies do varies greatly, so buyer beware. Some (but not all) of the most vocal private companies do the lowest quality research.

In theory you could invest in companies that supply equipment to fusion researchers. But most of the suppliers are either small private companies that make a niche product, or large public companies where fusion makes up a tiny percentage of their revenue."
2021-05-26 07:23:56,stocks,"At first glance I would look at the ARKX and UFO ETFs for a ultra long term commitment like this, for that 20-30 year investment.

If I wanted a shorter term 2-5 year investment in something like ITER by looking at the contractors and material suppliers that have been subcontracted to provide services for ITER and investing in those.  Although I suspect at this point in project those contracts are already signed and built into the stock price.

If hot fusion is ever successful it will consume and drive the consumption of lithium.  Which right now the biggest company in world is ALB Albemarle corporation."
2021-05-26 06:55:51,stocks,"I'm not convinced something like this will take off. Not unless it's a renewable with no emissions. Which to my knowledge nuclear fusion is not.
The bigger problem is in the name. Nuclear. There have been a lot of fission reactors shutting down even though there is more life and profit in them because of the public image. The general public doesn't like the sound of nuclear. It sounds dangerous. We've got Chernobyl to thank for that. So I wouldn't be convinced that within the next 50 years it will happen. They also usually take a while to turn a profit due to long construction times and high cost.

If it were me I'd look into energy storage. The more we move to renewables the more we will need to store energy to deal with the difference in peak usage and peak production."
2021-05-26 08:53:43,stocks,"I bought LMT because they announced they were ~6 years away from a working prototype of a fusion reactor that could fit on a truck.

Oak Ridge National Lab, PPPL (princton plasma physics lab), and Savannahy River National lab, 

IDK if these are publicly traded companies, as this is information i am trying to find out at as well."

2021-05-26 06:39:40,stocks,"The numbers for fusion and fission do not make sense. Already much more expensive than solar. And think about what would happen if you would generate as much fusion and fission as there is solar, you would add a 2nd sun as a heat source. That's why these technologies do not have the potential to generate as much energy as solar can. It would literally get too hot. I don't see fusion and fission being realized for other reasons than to redirect the $5T fossil fuel subsidies to a new monopoly."

2021-05-26 07:26:14,stocks,Im interested in about 30-40 years for investment on this topic. I am still in my mid 20s. Willing to HODL fusion into retirement. Im going to look into those etf's and potentially others with diligence! Tysm for pointing me in the right direction! Stay blessed
2021-05-26 07:00:00,stocks,Energy storage and solar are good alternatives if you don't understand the science behind fusion. I have multiple university level physics courses to help fuel my knowledge of fusion. I recommend reading into it a bit more it will help ease the skepticism. But that does take effort. I am also a massive fan of energy storage. But we need to have a big way to create energy to store in advanced batteries. Imo fusion bridges this gap. Just my opinion. Also they are designed scientifically to be fail proof. If you understand plasma and magnets it could help. Not saying that things cant or will not go wrong thats always on the table. But the % chance is not even in the same universe as fission .
2021-05-26 06:41:41,stocks,First off fission and fusion are two completely different beasts. I hope you do some research on this. Im sure theres other things in your post that are off but I don't care to read if you think both technologies are the same ü•±

2021-05-26 11:31:36,stocks,"It is a long running joke. But honestly though if anything would be the catalyst for the ""next"" industrial revolution it'd be fusion. 

I think it has taken a back seat because as the climate crisis has gotten markedly worse it won't be ready until after the window of opportunity we are in now. But in building a high energy consumption low carbon future fusion definitely will have a part to play.

From an power engineers perspective I do give a longer timescale, which if I had to give a single year 2047 would be it. But we are way too far from commercial realisation for retail investment."

And after a while i decided that it is too complex of an issue even for me to predict where SMRs will go. They're definitelly a better investment than fusion within the next 30-50 years though. Overall, big nuclear fission power plants are and will be for decades the best option for generating energy in a stable and sufficient way. Supplemented by new green stuff, such as solar and wind. Personally, if i should pick fusion, SMRs or conventional nuclear power plants as an investment for next 50 years, I'd go with conventional nuclear power plants for sure. With no hesitation at all."

I have a PhD myself and my research is related to biomedical devices. If you ask me, I would advise anyone to be cautious about biomedical startups, because 99% of them are either overhyped or outright scams, and if they do get big, chances are that they would end up like Theranos. Even if they say their research is backed by peer reviewed papers published on famous journals, thare can be tons of issues with their technology. How do I know this?

2021-05-26 12:07:07,stocks,">you being a self proclaimed expert 

Nuclear engineer here. Most laypeople assuming that nuclear physicists design nuclear power plants (both fission and fusion), but they do not. They're experts in a different field which aims to study the structure of the parts of the atom. While nuclear physics is important to nuclear power, it's only a small piece of a greater system. For fusion, in particular, the nuclear physics issues were all  solved decades ago. The success or failure of a fusion power plant depends issues related to plasma physics, materials science, heat transfer, etc.  

A good analogy is to compare a chemist and an automotive engineering. Yes, chemistry is important to the design of an internal combustion engine. But the engine is only one part of car, and even the design of an engine is more than just chemistry.  

So by proclaiming to be an nuclear physicists, he's abusing the average laypersons misconception, to give the appearance that his is an expert in one field when in truth he is an expert in different field."

* Downsides include: 
   * susceptibility to economic downturns, 
   * if interest rates climb it will make it harder for them to offer attractive financing,
   * 2020 supply chain shortages interrupting inventory,
   * High debt levels,
   * Competitive advantages, as I see them currently, are limited:
      * small pricing advantage over smaller competitors,
      * limited protection in certain markets where regulations or distributor arrangements keep their competitors out for certain vehicle brands.
* Fundamental Numbers:
   * Free Cash Flow - went positive for the last 4 years. They ended 2020 with $381m in FCF. 
      * CAGR on FCF from 2017 to 2020 equaled 86.4%.

The last few numbers are very concerning to me.  That's a whole lot of debt they are carrying!  Combined with limited economic moats.... Hmmmm.  However, I did compare their 2020 numbers to Carmax, one of their biggest competitors.  Carmax had a whooping LT Debt/Earnings ratio of 20.7, revenue of roughly $19b, and EPS of $4.52.  Carmax's growth number were also much less overall.

Given their LT debt/Earnings was roughly 1/4 of a direct competitor's and their growth numbers were looking good to me, I was continuing to do some reading and research.  Then Lithia made a rather big announcement.  They're doing a new public offering of shares valued at $1b.  At the same time they announced a private offering of $800¬†million in senior notes (3.875%) that would be due 2029...  Nearly another billion in LT Debt?!?!?  ARRGGHHHHH!

Looking at their 2021 Q1 presentation, they do give target uses of capital, which at least shows they have a plan that they are willing to publish.  Those plans are as follows:    

* Internal Investment & Modernization 25% 
   * (Actual 5-year average: 17%) 
* Share Repurchases 5%
   * (Actual 5-year average: 11%) 
* Dividends 5% 
   * (Actual 5-year average: 4%) 
* Acquisitions 65% 
   * (Actual 5-year average: 68%) 

Their stated goal in the 2021 Q1 for acquisitions is an annual addition of $3-5 billion in revenues.  They also posted good numbers for Q1 YoY and compared to the previous quarter.  However, with the debt now I feel like the research rabbit hole has gotten a little deeper for me....

I suppose the silver lining is that the 2 valuations of the company I ran and margin of safety puts them outside of my current buy range.  So I've got the time for the research."

2021-05-26 07:56:13,stocks,"This morning I did very briefly glance at another competitor, Carvana.  They are an all digital, used-car market competitor.  Revenue for 2020 was $5.5b, with negative earnings, and $1.6b in long term debt.  Their Q1 performance did see growing revenue YoY, but their debt grew in turn.  

I need to keep looking at the automotive retailer market, but I'm beginning to think higher debt ratios might be part and parcel.  Which does make some sense with the higher (and high value) inventories they have to manage.  In Lithia Motors case, they're obviously heavily invested in acquisitions, which can further drive that debt level higher. 

I need to discern if their use of debt is good or bad.  I'm still relatively new to doing this research, and I would like to grasp it a little more fully."

2021-05-26 00:00:00,stocks,"RIDE: Is Lordstown Motors doomed now? What a difference eight months makes!

Eight months ago, I made my first ""call of calls"" on a blockbuster event amongst reverse mergers.  Eight months ago, I made the ""call of calls"" on what was then a different ticker, and what now belongs to Lordstown Motors (RIDE).

And indeed, RIDE went on to become the fourth of nine realized blockbuster events amongst reverse mergers.

Then came Workhorse's loss of the USPS contract.  That was nothing, as production could continue on the main EV product.  Lordstown Motors could still take on Ford and its F-150.

Then came the Hindenburg short report.  RIDE became the second of three realized blockbuster events shorted by Hindenburg.  Like, really?

Then came the announced production delays recently, most likely due to semiconductor shortages.  The commercial EV startup's chances against Ford got dashed big time.

Then came something bigger and more unfortunate for RIDE bagholders: Rivian is just another EV startup.  Ford is a typical Big Auto laggard in EVs.

Not so the Next Tesla.

Not so the Next Tesla, Volkswagen, Das Auto, its proven track record in the commercial pickup truck business, and [now its own foray into EV pickup trucks](https://motorillustrated.com/volkswagen-trademarks-amarok-is-compact-pickup-coming/76784/), semiconductor shortages be damned.

Maybe health sector will overtake tech etc. With a world portfolio you will capture the growth of the world economy. However you won't be able to catch crazy 25% returns or something."

2021-05-26 11:45:16,stocks,"A lot of folks here have pointed out some consistent things to rock with. 

But as someone who has further gravitated in that direction after having a rather unfortunate timing of starting in early Feb, here‚Äôs some advice I can give you: Don‚Äôt lump sum it all at once. 

You often here you can‚Äôt time the market on a point by point basis but it has been demonstrably shown that spreading the capital you put in over a longer period of time gives you a better buffer against zany volatility. Imagine you invest all that $10k at once and then suddenly next week some awful inflation news comes out. Now all your money is trapped at a bad basis and you have nothing left to offset it with. 

My advice is once you find the assets you‚Äôre willing to go the distance with, only put a fraction of that 10k in. I‚Äôd say consider 3-5k to start and leave the rest as cash for a bit. Then take some time watching the market and seeing how your investments fair. If it goes well, you can gradually average up in careful quantity. But if things go poorly you can either average down or consider revising your picks without suffering as great a downside. Whether you do it on a set schedule or at times you find ideal, spreading your money out will give you the best buffer against the market‚Äôs unpredictable day to day movements."

I believe that Curve Finance on the polygon network is paying out around 9% apy in stable and an additional 30% but paid in matic, which you could just swap back out for something like USDC and reinvest it back into your stable coins pool so it can compound. 

I admit that this method would probably make things a bit complicated for tax reporting purposes and Curve has a bit of a complicated UI for those who aren't tech savvy/defi savvy."

2021-05-26 10:09:54,stocks,"A couple of things. 

* I deliberately choose choose a large and mid only developed markets only benchmark and try to mix and match other indexes because it allows me to decide myself how much I want to weight developed and emerging markets
* The FTSE Global All Cap Index is great. I recommend it for anyone that just want's to set and forget and never worry about anything at all, it's a very fine choice.
* I am not trying to exactly recreate the worldwide stock market but balance it out with a small emphasis on gdp. However I don't want to fully recreate the world economy only by gdp, so I am going for less than the overweight [56%](https://www.statista.com/statistics/710680/global-stock-markets-by-country/) but more than the [16%](https://www.statista.com/statistics/256381/share-of-global-regions-in-the-gross-domestic-product/)\-[24%](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/the-88-trillion-world-economy-in-one-chart/) (depending on calculation) of the worldwide gdp share the US holds.  


So while 47% is still relatively high overall this is more or less necessary because the US holds a large share of the publicly listed companies and is the biggest economy of the west. However I do not want to bet nearly 60% of my money on a single country, which is why I prefer to go with a 70/30 World/EM Portfolio."

2021-05-26 00:00:00,stocks,"1.5 Billion People in China, Estimated 600 Million Bikes, Now the Ebike, Stock Symbol EZGO 225 miles $275 US Dollars Hello everyone. As we all know China is extremely populated and they definitely lover their bikes. They are much more affordable than cars. They are much less space. They are cheaper than gas and most importantly pretty much anyone, any age can use a bike! I tried to research as much as I could the exact number of bikes in China but I could not find that unfortunately. The 600 million estimate was as close I could find.

Most importantly we may be able to make an investment. EZGO is the Ebike and IPO‚Äôed early on in January. The execution from the company has been amazing. However, the stock has come down a lot. The figures yesterday 5/24/2021 given by the CEO were 6 months thru March 31st of 2021 and did not even include some big deals. 

Let me go thru some important highlights and insights from the CEO:

**Revenue grew 224% to $16.8 Million from just $5.2 Million**

**Projected sales of 100,000 bikes in 2021 (Which was given February 17th)**

**Sales of the 2 wheel bicycles increased 50% to 23,000 units while the 3 wheel increased 600% to 11,000 units! Total of 34,000 units. (5/24/2021 The CEO gave this update and said sales have increased drastically and it expects rapid revenue growth)** 

***These numbers were for ending March 31st and does not Include the following!!!***

**4/1/2021 EZGO reports a large order from the Ukraine the stock spikes to 9.48!** **These bikes are to be delivered in April!**

**4/15/2021 EZGO signs a new contract for 10,000 Bikes after an exhibition displaying their bikes**

Their higher end bike sells for about $300 US dollars and travels 225 miles on a single charge. Most bikes are about $200 and have 150-200 Mile range. You can go to their website EZGOtech, I do not want to get banned by including links. The bikes look great!

At 100,000 bikes, could be more and 300 a bike we are looking at 30 million in sales‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶which is 100% growth again‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. I believe that estimate is light!

Thoughts? Opinions?"

As these well know automakers eat away at TSLA they'll also be perfecting their own FA for years down the road when that becomes the norm.

This is excluding regulatory credits, bitcoin, this is there operating cash flow so they are already extremely profitable and with the more cars they sell not only does their margins improve but there revenue numbers increase which will net you and even higher operating cash flow. Selling 499.5k cars it was 4.4 billion. What happens when they sell 1.5-2 million cars in 2022 on higher margins. That number is going to be huge. It could be 4x, 17.6 billion Operating Cash flow.

2021-05-26 01:13:49,stocks,"I hear your point, but think that 40% revenue growth is likely underestimating Tesla's trajectory at least for the next few years significantly and also ignores margin expansion of which there's likely to be a lot (removal of radar, additional FSD revs at $10k per vehicle, front-end casting, and 4680 cells all seem like feasible areas of improvement).

I'm viewing 50% growth as the minimum target this year and with Q1 showing 74% YoY growth and production ramping alongside an expansion in Shanghai plus two additional factories starting up later in the year I don't think that's terribly unreasonable. Both Austin and Berlin have the physical footprint to have much higher production than their existing facilities as well.

Still not adding unless it hits $500 but if and when it does I'm finding a fat stack of cash to drop on it unless something major changes in the meantime."

2021-05-25 21:54:17,stocks,"This should have been part of your research when analysing an investment potential. You typically attempt to map out its financial results. I usually do annual revisions when the annual reports come out, but quarterly reports are also important because things can change suddenly. 

Phrases similar to this (out of context) are kind of bad obviously. It‚Äôs like how people say ‚Äúcut your losses short‚Äù. It really only applies to things with context. In your case, if there was a specific investment they‚Äôre talking about, it likely means they believe the company has room to grow."

2021-05-26 12:01:08,stocks,So basically what I realized is that it only works on longs.  If you have a profitable short you need to cut it way faster than a long.  Took me a while to realize this...that a short is not the same as just the inverse of a long.
2021-05-26 12:30:04,stocks,"The longer you hold a stock, the easier it is to discern your real winners.  These are the stocks that have continued to go up over longer periods of time and through multiple cycles and different macro economic environments."
2021-05-26 13:17:49,stocks,"""let your winners ride"" is usually referring to when you're slowly scaling out of a position and you took some profits already, but are letting the rest ride because you never know how high it can possibly go. This is important for risk management because you don't want to constantly cut your winners short. If you keep your losses small and winners big, you will be profitable.

2021-05-26 09:47:04,stocks,What an awful strategy!
2021-05-26 10:39:39,stocks,why would you sell if the stock is fantastic? I bought C shares at $45 and it is $77 now. I don't plan on selling until October so I can get that 10% discount on my taxes (1 year of holding). But I might still hold on to half for life. The company is making billions a year.

2021-05-26 01:54:07,stocks,Ok
2021-05-26 05:20:52,stocks,"Yes I understand TA. I've been doing this a while.  I've studied behavioral finance too. The only validation to TA is that other ""herd mentality"" TA users keep it alive by all acting the same to the patterns. When you invest,  taking the business approach of being an owner is always far superior than trying to predict what a group of traders will do.  You can't use TA to see where a company is going to be 5 years or 10 years from now.

 Seeing patterns in the past is always going to be a reaction of the mind. The only reason they all seem to work,  is because when they don't... the pattern isn't formed to validate.   Supports and resistance as well, it's all trader mentality.  Resistance is created by the fear of traders that missed selling at the previous recent highs,  so traders who missed selling the last time tend to pull trigger as it approaches again causing a high sell demand,  or what you TA folks call it Resistance point.  Reality is that there is no fundamental behind that, it's just behavior of traders."
2021-05-26 10:10:23,stocks,TA Does not predict what a group of traders will do. I don‚Äôt believe you understand TA.
2021-05-26 10:16:23,stocks,"Since your just making judgements instead of using facts to argue,  I'll use my judgements of you.  I don't believe you understand the market, business,  and investing in general.  Probably in your teens or twenties who is inexperienced enough to think you know everything.

Where do you see on TA that a company is going to create a new product 5 years from now that will double their revenue? Where was the coronavirus shut down shown coming via TA? It's just time consuming garbage for people who don't have a value to their own time, and have the short sighted impatience."

2021-05-26 00:00:00,stocks,"Discovery + Warner Media from ATT means the stock is worth less? What gives? DISCA was $43 Premarket 5/17/2021 and closed at $30.66?? What? If there are thoughts both PROS and CONs regarding this mega deal please feel free to comment. I want all the minds on Reddit to try and make some sense out of this....

When this deal was announced May 17th DISCA and T were on fire. Premarket I was watching shares catch fire and go above $43 on DISCA. Later on during the day, I did decide to start trading it as it fell to $34. In my opinion close to $34-35 is a fair value for the stock without a deal!

DISCA now has 15 + million subscribers for their 4.99 service. Expectations were for 8. We all know the streaming is the wave. As we see also with Netflix and Disney there is enough for them all provided we have rich content. In the most recent report DISCA beat on top line and said that the streaming business added 4 million subs in just the last 2 months. This business is alot more profitable. Current bottom line is about 2.79 for the year, next year is about 3.25 without factoring in the rapid streaming and more profitable side of the business. This yields a PE ratio of this year near 11 and next year under 10! Doesn't that sound cheap for a large company that will grow sales between 10-15%?

This is all before the Warner Media deal.... So in my mind DISCA is worth 34-35.... On it's own its executing and turning the business around.....so now with Adult Swim, Boomerang, Cartoon Network, CNN, TBS, TNT, TruTV, Turner Classic Movies, Turner Sports, HBO..... now its worth less?

I understand we won't be able to see the full details and synergies yet.... this deal may or may not even close! It will be at least 6 months out.... but in the mean time DISCA which has been delivering is getting crushed? This combines to be close to a 50 billion company...... Unfortunately, T paid over 85 billion, and there is still alot of debt. But please help me figure out how DISCA isnt worth at least 35..... 

Should we just can the deal and fight to stop the merger? Is that what the market is saying? That combining all that and maybe charging 14.99 for HBO and Discovery + and maybe having 100 million subscribers is not good?...... Do we see what it is doing for DISNEY? Just shaking my head here.

Thoughts? Thank you"
2021-05-25 21:03:44,stocks,I believe Discovery shareholders only get like 29% of the new company.
2021-05-25 22:29:36,stocks,ATT keeps making poor choices buying more/other media companies. Investors werent to happy that‚Äôs why the price went down. ATT could be what Verizon is with growth and dividend but.....it keeps making poor choices.
2021-05-25 21:21:28,stocks,"I was long DISCA and got out as the bottom fell out a couple months ago. They work great as a lean niche cash flow positive low expense service which hits core demos of passionate fans for a cheap rate. Can they do the massive conglomerate thing and drive mainstream audience in a sustained way that Netflix does... maybe? But that‚Äôs a harder game to play. 

I am potentially interested in the new company should they show the ability to grow cash flows and pay down the now massive debt. But I don‚Äôt see a good way to enter predeal so I‚Äôm on the sidelines till I see what shakes out."
2021-05-25 21:35:26,stocks,A stock does not equal the company. The stock market does not automatically equate to good business models.

2021-05-25 21:05:41,stocks,I believe so as well...but the deal is so far away ...even if we don't know how the deal will go down to crush disca this far in advance doesn't make sense to me
2021-05-25 22:30:42,stocks,"This is a fair and just thought...
My thing is, so disca the stock has 0 meaning for a year??"
2021-05-25 21:23:54,stocks,Agreed...we dont know how to value a new deal...the thing is that could be a year out....so disca 20 or 40?
2021-05-25 21:17:59,stocks,"I think it's be even more of a shock if the deal DIDN'T happen at this point. These are no small companies and the amount of lawsuits that would ensue of they decided not to do it after people bailed on the stocks would be pretty insane. Basically, anyone buying DISCA at this point is purchasing 29% of the new company...at least as far as we know."
2021-05-25 22:56:03,stocks,Well it‚Äôs worth what people wanna pay for it as a stock. I understand where you coming from tho. To me Dicovery + is not worthy of my $ monthly. I‚Äôve kept it for awhile because my son watches reruns of the GoldMining shows. If you could watch the regular Discovery Channel live on +  it would be worth my sub.
2021-05-25 22:46:19,stocks,"If you agree, why play? The great the about the market is you only need to play games that you think you understand"
2021-05-25 21:23:52,stocks,Buying DISCA now means you are getting 29% of both Discovery and HBO.  The deal is clearly designed to be balanced or the shorted side would have walked away.
2021-05-25 21:20:38,stocks,"I agree about the buying 29 percent of the newer company but can't make sense how they are valuing a company that has formed...at least do this as the deal gets closer?

Seems to be holding pretty steady around $29 though."
2021-05-25 21:26:41,stocks,"Well I don't think you're alone. Discover is technically worth about 1/3 what it was...but when you add in the Time Warner part to the equation it throws everything into a guess. Shareholders are HOPING the new company has the 150 billion valuation some estimated it could be worth...but nobody will know until it goes public. Meh, I'll probably buy shares of the new company at some point, but I bailed on $T around $31 and just bought up $BABA."

2021-05-26 00:00:00,stocks,Long put short covered call So let‚Äôs say you don‚Äôt have much money say 2k. You want to try and make some premium with low downside risk. If you pick a stock like Ford (which I‚Äôm my opinion is risky) to sell covered calls on weekly you could also have a long put to cover your ass if shit hit the fan. Does anyone have experience doing this? I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôm theory they should cancel out if worse comes to worse. Is there a calculation that can be done to find out max loss thresh hold? I want to try this and it seems too good to be true.
2021-05-25 21:15:58,stocks,"It's called a 'collar'. If the money you get from the call you sold is greater than or equal to the long put, then it is called a 'cost free collar'. It protects against the downside but limits profits on the upside. Not a horrible strategy in today's market. I have not done it, but have been considering it lately."
2021-05-25 21:19:03,stocks,"You could do this, but you would be giving up a significant portion of your gains from your covered calls for downside protection (the long put you plan to buy). 

Instead, pick a stock that you wouldn‚Äôt mind holding through corrections, bad ERs, etc. and sell CCs on it. If it falls, that‚Äôs not a problem because you are confident in the company and the ability for its stock to make a recovery."
2021-05-25 21:25:24,stocks,The point is I have about 2k cash to play with. Any stock I wouldn‚Äôt mind holding 100x shares of is out of my price range. If i use a stock like Ford I could be spending around 60 dollars in put premium for about 7 months coverage. Then I could sell OTM covered calls every week for say 10 dollars. 28 weeks * 10  280 dollars a plus a possible assignment. That leaves me with a potential profit of 220 for 6 months of doing nothing. Although most of my capital would be tied up. It doesn‚Äôt sound too bad. Of course Ford could announce something out of no where and premium prices could get juicer. Idk

There are a huge number of people who are buying it for the short term because they think everyone else will be buying it because it's cheap, all trying to sell after the split actually happens. Back to the point of fundamentals, their profit was lower in 2019 and 2020 than in 2018 - this could be fine if they were reinvesting it all, but they aren't. In 2020 their revenue was only about 25% more than in 2018 but their stock price is more than double. They're a great company, but they are too expensive right now.

2021-05-25 22:43:44,stocks,My bad. It's paywall'd so I didn't
2021-05-25 20:52:10,stocks,"It's a game of musical chairs and the Fed holds the whistle. They will blow for time whenever inflation becomes too detrimental to the uber-rich's savings; inflation is a wealth transfer from lenders to borrowers over time. We are already seeing equities and bonds become more correlated in their moves, because the market is expecting the period of free money to come to an end. When time is up, everything is coming down.

If you're asking, ""When is the music going to end?"" Then my bet is the Fed is going to raise rates in Q1 2021, but I also think they are behind the market and the 10 year is going to 200 basis points by November. So the market will probably sell off some time between now and then.

From a technical perspective, we are trading in and around the fibonnaci extension from the previous cycle high pre-covid (SPY $339.70) at 1.618 of $414.90, which was pretty much on the nose with the close from the day before yesterday at $414.94. The 1.618x target would be $535.60, which is definitely out of reach given we are already deep in the euphoria stage of the market cycle.

So I would guess action is going to trade side-ways-ish depending on the news over the next few weeks, then begin trending back to SPY $340 towards Q1. If Burry is right and the Fed is behind the curve on hyper-inflation, then we're probably going bear market $160-180. But if inflation does not get too out of hand and the Fed reverses course after raising rates and starts pumping again, it could be $535. So that would be my 3 year call hehe $160-$535, depending on whether the music *stops* or just slows down."

I think I may continue to sit out until there is a major pullback. Do you have a strategy?"
2021-05-26 11:06:51,stocks,But is now a good entry point for spy? When it‚Äôs at ath?
2021-05-25 21:28:20,stocks,"If you are following the market on a daily basis, then you might as well partake in the game of musical chairs. Right now, the market is euphoric and at the ATH, so a pullback could be imminent, or the market could go on another run.

I'd wait right now to see what happens in the next week or two as we get a move one way or another away from SPY $415. If the market still has room to move higher, then I'd maintain 25% USD, 15% EUR (managing the currency balance depending on whether EURUSD breaks higher or lower), 5% crypto (once volatility has died down; BTC, ETH, IOTA); 10% gold, and 45% in reopening equity trades. Financials, consumer spending, and cash-positive FANGs like Apple and Google. Just try to keep your positions as simple as possible so you can quickly liquidate your positions and move into a strong currency if shit hits the fan.

I think if you wait you'll be able to get 225 basis points or more on the 10 year, some time next year. It will depend on whether inflation gets out of control or not, whether the Fed needs to go on a crazy hiking spree that would crush bonds. But I'd probably start buying the front end of the curve out to the 10 year bonds around 190-225 basis points in small position sizes, maybe through ETFs. I wouldn't use ETFs outside of bonds however, as you can usually find good picks that will outperform the market, and you don't want to be caught in a stampede where you are trying to sell the same basket of stocks as every other retail investor out there.

So yeah, 40-45% cash position, then try to sell-out before the music stops, and look to buy the big companies with an aggressive 75% equity/15% bond/5% crypto/5% cash portfolio. For the equities portion, I'm thinking:

Alphabet 15%

Amazon 12.5%

Tesla 12.5% (Tesla, unlike Google, Apple, and Amazon, is debt heavy with relatively weak cash flow, so will suffer from high rates more than other tech companies. So buy low.)

Nvidia 10%

Apple 10%

JP Morgan 10%

Microsoft 5%

Visa 5%

Costco 5%

Home Depot 5%

Coca-cola 5%

Crispr 2.5%

Exact Sciences 2.5%"

2021-05-26 00:00:00,stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, May 25, 2021 **PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, May 25, 2021**

Stocks traded mostly sideways today, managing to mostly hold on to recent gains, despite new data on consumer confidence coming in below expectations. After the volatility experienced in the first few weeks of May, recent price action has been more encouraging to me. The S&P 500 (SPY) closed 0.2% down, the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) closed 0.15% up, and the Dow Jones (DIA) closed 0.22% down. 

Today, the Conference Board (a non-profit research organization), released their April Consumer Confidence index which showed sentiment falling steeper than expected. The report showed the consumer confidence index dipped to 117.2 in May from 117.5 in April. However, on the positive side, April's reading was the highest since February 2020, before the start of Covid-19 lockdowns. Economists expected consumer confidence to rise to 119.5. 

A separate report by Standard & Poor‚Äôs said that its S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller national home price index posted an annual gain of 13.2% in March up from 12% in February and marking 10-straight months of acceleration in home prices. The results far outpaced analysts‚Äô expectations of a 12.5% annual gain, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. According to a recent Reuters poll, U.S. house prices are forecast to outpace GDP growth and consumer inflation ‚Äî rising at a blistering pace to average 10.6% this year, almost double the 5.7% predicted in February. With demand rising faster than supply, it is not surprising to see home prices surging forward, with economists expecting the growth to taper once supply rises to meet demand. Total housing inventory at the end of April was 1.16 million units, down 20.5% from one year ago ‚Äî the lowest level since NAR started tracking homes for sale in 2011. Inventory, however, was up 10.5% from March, an indication that homebuilding is picking up.

Today, members of the Federal Open Markets Committee reiterated their stance that the Fed was not yet worried about rising prices forcing the Fed to tighten monetary policy sooner than expected. St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said he believed increases in inflation would be ‚Äúmostly temporary‚Äù and that the Fed was ‚Äúnot quite there yet‚Äù when it came to discussing tapering its asset purchase program. In separate comments, Kansas City Federal Reserve President Esther George said she did not want the Fed to be ‚Äúoverly reliant on historical relationships and dynamics in judging the outlook for inflation.‚Äù 

**Highlights**

* [U.S. new home sales pulled back less than expected in April over March,](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-home-sales-fell-5-140851441.html) even as rising prices, tight inventory began to ripple through the housing market. New home sales fell by 5.9% in April over the previous month, giving back some of March's 7.4% gain, [the Commerce Department said Tuesday](https://www.census.gov/construction/nrs/pdf/newressales.pdf). Consensus economists were looking for a drop of 7%
* The Washington DC‚Äôs Attorney General filed an antitrust lawsuit against Amazon.com Inc. on Tuesday, alleging the company blocks sellers on its marketplace from offering lower prices elsewhere to stymie competition
* Reddit-stocks like Gamestop (GME) and AMC are once again on the move higher.
* The court case between Epic Games and Apple (AAPL) s expected to end this week as both sides prepare closing arguments. As a reminder, Epic Games is accusing Apple of antitrust behavior by taking a 30% commission from sales in the app store and blocking companies from using third-party payment options. Apple says it prevents third-party software to ensure consumer protection and the commission is in-line with other app-store developers, like Alphabet. The result of this case will have very wide ranging implications.
* Amazon (AMZN) is reportedly nearing a deal to buy the Hollywood studio MGM for roughly $9 billion, in a deal that would turn the movie studio into a streaming asset for AMZN. According to people familiar with the matter, a deal could close as soon as next week.
* **\*\*Please note that current stock price was written premarket and does not reflect intraday changes\*\***
* American Electric Power (AEP) target raised by Barclays from $95 to $105 at Overweight. Stock currently around $86.50

Covid probably has caused at least a point of systematic unemployment as people reassess their lives and decide not to return to traditional labor. That will be their next line I bet, as they explain while they are hiking with unemployment still at 5-6%.

The cynical side of me says cutting QE and raising rates coming out of covid when inequality is so high will cause another massive buying opportunity for the rich to collect more rents."

2021-05-25 23:42:54,stocks,"That's fine, most of your points aren't wrong. And I'm not here saying everyone needs to do exactly what I do. I note that silver historically fluctuates between 1:20 and 1:45. Recently it's 1:65ish. You can adjust gold to whatever price you want, but for over 2000 years, silver was worth roughly 1:15 - 1:30 of that price. Unless we want to argue that gold is massively overpriced, a 1:67 ratio (as of today) would tend to point to silver being undervalued. Will it ever ""correct?"" Perhaps not, but it seems like a better place to put my money.

I'll quickly acknowledge that the last 20 years have significantly deviated from past norms. It's my hypothesis that this is unsustainable over the next 40, and that the global banks have printed their way into a tipping point where we may see a shift back towards physically backed assets. It's the same with the digital, where we can clearly see a waning faith in paper currency. Perhaps the latter will be the better performing asset, but I can wrap my head around physical money more easily than a digital, backless one. I'm likely wrong. 

I'm not in PMs to try to make great returns, though. I think it's a fine long term store of value, that will counter inflation. Holding physical vs an ETF is a matter of personal preference, and the latter is fine. I personally prefer physical precisely because it's outside of the market. I'm the last person to get into conspiracies about PM ETF holdings, but having the overwhelming majority of my net worth tied to the market, it's nice to have a store of value exist outside of that. The chances of the US going all Venezuela and imploding are extremely unlikely, but if you're bothering to hedge your investments in the first place, it makes more sense to me to just do it ""right"" and hold physical. It's similar to how RH doesn't allow their investors to own the keys to the digital they supposedly own. 

I'm not disagreeing with any of your points, but I'm not sure where you get that $19 fee to sell. I can walk down to my LCS today and get spot value. I lose, at current prices roughly $4 on the premium paid, but like I said, they're abnormally high right now. Over a lifetime of buying, they tend to be lower. I understand when I purchase today, that I'm essentially buying at $32/oz. It's my belief that over the next few decades, it will be worth more than that. I'll reiterate that I'm not shooting for any market beating returns, it's a safeguard against any problems. 

Ultimately, my case boils down to holding physical because I believe it to be a more adequate hedge against a highly unlikely collapse than holding those assets inside the market, and that silver is currently undervalued to the price of gold. Both of those things could very well prove to be untrue, and maybe I end up losing out in the long term. But at only 3% of my portfolio, I'm OK taking the risk of a loss for the downside protection against any crazy devaluation of the dollar.

But a PM hedge isn't for everyone, so don't listen to me."

2021-05-26 00:00:00,stocks,"My big bet on Molson Coors Beverage Company ($TAP) **$TAP**

I only make two or three ""high-conviction"" trades per year. When I trade, I go big with serious conviction. I want to tell you about my biggest trade ever - Molson Coors (3500 shares @ $55.44). I've also got a bunch of options that expire in October.

I am not a ""technical"" trader. Nor am I a ""fundamental"" trader. I'm a guy who follows Chris Camillo & and the Dumb Money ""social arbitrage"" style of investing. Chris has over a decade of 60%+ annual returns. The goal in this style of investing is to find game-changing information about a company that Wall Street doesn't know, research it like crazy, put on a trade, and then wait for the suits on Wall Street to discover the information when the company announces quarterly results. When game changing information is discovered by the suits in New York, they buy like crazy and drive the price up.

If you want to read more ""fundamental"" analysis on $TAP, read [this awesome due diligence](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lvb868/molsoncoors_beverage_co_tap_dd_reopening_play/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) over on WallStreetBets from u/undream22.

**Background of the Trade:**

Molson Coors is an old company. They make the majority of their money off of cheap beer (e.g. Coors Light, Miller Lite, & Miller High Life). For the last 4-5 years, their stock has sunk because cheap beer is losing market share to hard seltzers and higher margin specialty beers.

Truly & White Claw took over the seltzer market which is growing quickly. FYI - hard seltzer's are way more profitable than beer.

The company got a new CEO who implemented a ""Revitalization Plan"" and is heavily investing in more profitable ""above premium"" beverages to make more money off of their huge distribution network. The important beverages include (but are not limited to) the following:

* Topo Chico Hard Seltzer
* Zoa - Dwayne ""the Rock"" Johnston's energy drink
* Vizzy Hard Seltzer

**Thesis of the Trade:**

Molson Coors has three huge winners on its hands ***and Wall Street has no idea***. Once Molson Coors starts reporting actual numbers from Topo Chico, Vizzy, & Zoa at the end of this quarter they are going to crush all the analyst earnings estimates. This will lead to the big boys on Wall Street buying up TAP and driving up the price.

**Why Doesn't Wall Street Know Yet?:**

While the analysts certainly know that Molson Coors is distributing these beverages, they simply don't realize how big of a deal these drinks are. They don't know this because 1) the recent quarterly numbers do not reveal it, and 2) Wall Street doesn't pay attention to store checks, Google Trends, or the power of social media.

Let me explain:

* Topo Chico Hard Seltzer was released to the public on March 29, 2021. This preliminary launch was limited to nine select markets. Two days later, Molson Coors' Q1 ended.  **So, Wall Street doesn't have any actual numbers on Topo Chico Hard Seltzer yet**. I recommend that you listen to the Q1 call (April 29th). In the Q1 call, the CEO only talked briefly about getting unexpected market share in Texas with Topo Chico. However, based on the Dumb Money community channel checks (Check our our Discord group), stores in every market where it was released are selling Topo Chico HS like crazy. Topo Chico is selling as good (if not better) than Truly and White Claw. This is a huge deal. Moreover, Google Trends show people are searching ""topo chico hard seltzer"" more than ""truly hard seltzer"" and more than ""white claw hard seltzer."" That is amazing. And it was only released in NINE markets. It might be way bigger when it gets release to the rest of the country. Finally, #TopoChico is trending on TikTok and Instagram. Don't underestimate the power of social media.
* Zoa was released on February 24th (2/3's into Q1). Aannnddd, it's release was initially limited to online sales and select in-store sales. **Any numbers from Zoa were de-minimis in Q1 results**. They are expanding their distribution, and Dumb Money members are finding it in grocery stores now. Just spend a few minutes looking at the Rocks Instagram feed to see how hard he is pushing this drink. The branding is excellent and he has over 239m followers on Instagram and 15.2 million on Twitter. Google Trends show people are searching ""zoa energy drink"" just as much as ""monster energy drink"" and more than ""red bull energy drink."" Think about that for a second. A bran new energy drink is just as sought after as two established brans that own the market. Again, Don't underestimate the power of the Rock on social media.
* Last quarter Molson Coors had **two** **unexpected events that significantly reduced earnings**. 1). The Texas freeze shut down their biggest manufacturing plant in Fort Worth, Texas, for several days - impacting earnings. 2). They had a cybersecurity event that shut down production even further. Read/listen to the last earnings call to learn more about these two one-off events. This obviously cut into earnings last quarter and yet they still beat estimates. My guess is that so long as they don't have any enormous and unexpected events during Q2, they are going to crush earnings.
* Vizzy was launched in 2020 in the middle of the pandemic. Google Trends shows it is now starting to compete with Truly and White Claw. It is a ""healthier"" hard seltzer because it has vitamins (I guess). This competition came from only one variety pack. They just released a new lemonade version that is getting much higher reviews that competitors. Moreover, Dumb Money store checks show it is selling out in Canada.
* I expected the next two quarters are going to be gangbusters for the entire industry - lifting Molson Coors and all the other alcohol companies. Think about it. The vaccine is highly distributed finally. Summer is coming. So many people are going to have BBQ's, go to baseball games, go on vacations, and just let loose. And it is the summer of hard seltzerI don't think Wall Street understands how big pent-up demand is for having a good time. Alcohol is going to flow this summer unlike anytime we've ever seen before. TAP is the ultimate recovery play.
* From a fundamental analysis, TAP is highly undervalued in comparison to its competitors. Just take some time and look at $BUD, $SAM, $STZ and you'll see what I mean. Again, if you want to read more ""fundamental"" analysis on $TAP, read [this awesome due diligence](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lvb868/molsoncoors_beverage_co_tap_dd_reopening_play/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) over on WallStreetBets from u/undream22.

Anyway, I'm tired of typing now. That is my trade. I hope someone appreciates this write-up.

Three final things:

1. If you want to know more about Chris Camillo, YouTube his famous Bloomberg interview. Also, he was recently featured in a recent ""Unknown Market Wizards"" book by Jack Schwager. Oh, and he wrote his own book back in the day called ""Laughing at Wall Street."" It's a great read.
2. I also HIGHLY recommend watching Dumb Money Live's episode on YouTube called ""Going ALL IN on $TAP""
3. I also HIGHLY recommend watching an older Dumb Money Live episode called ""Billion Dollar Energy Drink? Investing in ZOA from Dwayne ""the Rock"" Johnson""

P.S. Obviously, I'm not a financial advisor. This is my due diligence. Don't be lazy - do you own research. Don't listen to someone on the internet. Come up with your own research and make your own conclusions."
2021-05-25 20:18:40,stocks,"My circle drinks a lot of seltzer. Haven‚Äôt heard of either of these and I doubt white claw and truly sweat them at all. Everyone has a seltzer or two now.

Topo Chico hard seltzer has never been in our warehouse. We've been waiting since March, to get some into the grocery stores. Vizzy is another no name brand hard seltzer that suffers from a mediocre recipe. Coors can't make any money if were not getting it in the warehouse."

Plus, White Claw already has a strong inroad with college women (who I am to assume is seltzers' main demographic)."
2021-05-25 21:35:22,stocks,"I hear you but Topo Chico has amazing brand recognition in the South. Just ask people from Texas. People are enormously devoted to the brand. They are lesser known in northern markets. Coca Cola (which owns the Topo Chico brand ) is doing a huge nationwide push for Topo Chico Mineral Water. There are huge displays at most grocery stores across the country. TAP simply gets to ride along on that brand building bus as it will naturally translate into Topo Chico Hard Seltzer sales. I don't think the market is made yet, Coca Cola and TAP are gunning for the Hard Seltzer $$$. Plus, TAP CEO says his goal is simply to get 10% of the Hard Seltzer market. If they do that, (which I think they will do within the next two quarters) Wall Street is going to drive the price up."

HOWEVER during the Q1 call, the CEO was asked this question and his response was that financially, these new products are in their ‚ÄúAbove Premium‚Äù category which means there is an enormous financial incentive for TAP to push them as they are high margin products.

Six years ago I worked for a hedge fund that made a fortune shorting Coach and Michael Kors because we noticed shifts in foot traffic and buyer demographics around 2013-2014 or so with sales impacts really hitting around 2015-2016.

2021-05-26 00:00:00,stocks,"First major experience in the stock market with AMC and meme stocks Bought AMC back in February when everything kicked off.

I've had a few small OTC stuff with $100 thrown here or there in my account, this was my first foray into the real stock market.

Sold AMC last week at a loss, thought better of it, then bought it back in the dip. Cost basis went up (wash sale), so set a sell limit today and exited AMC when it dropped this morning.

Basically AMC at this point is pump and dump trading by WSB subreddit.

Sold for a loss today because it was tanking pretty hard in the am a few times. My cost basis was adjusted from the wash sale, so total loss playing around with AMC was like $30.  Now it's up to $15+ again this afternoon??? Can't deal lol

Is it often stocks jump by $2-3 in a day at 15% gain/loss when the stock price is in the teens? I think not, unless big news for investors, no major news really for AMC or AMCs business plans so that's why it's mostly pump and dump, or a small squeeze at this point, but short float was 20% as of April 30th with millions of shares sold and bought each day since with probably a constant adjustment of the shorting of the stock going on.

Using this as an overall experience to: 1. Not have paper hands and panic sell at a loss before midday, and most importantly, 2. Don't day trade meme stocks with high volatility of it's value over months.  Might be a squeeze today I think and I paperhanded it, but you know what, I don't care, it was annoying wondering if it's ever going up or tank to sub 10s for the foreseeable future.

I couldn't handle the volatility so exited and took that  money I had in my account and went into marijuana ETFs that I'll hold for the long haul..."

anyway, im not sure if you pay attention to the growth stock space but there was definitely blood in the water these last few months. WSB had the suicide hotline posted and r/SPACs probably could have used it too, given the types of posts i saw there, lol

and that's just shares, which i dont really care about being down on. good companies will recover in time

2021-05-25 22:21:28,stocks,"I don't know why they wouldn't. I have a feeling they would do something similar to aapl, mixing dividends and buybacks and aiming to limit cash on hand. Holding massive cash reserves is somewhat inefficient. 

You're looking at dividends the wrong way. It's not they don't payout a lot, it's that their payout is so highly valued that the asset price increases to make the dividend yield appear small. 

I've held aapl for awhile. The dividend yield is tiny, smaller than when I first bought it. However, they've increased their dividend damn near year single year. I may think the div yield is inconsequential, but you have to remember, my cash on cash dividend return is on my cost basis for the shares, not what it's trading at as unrealized gains. For people who've owner these companies for a while, (large shareholders who actually appoint the board of directors) their dividends would be massive.

Here's an example. Buffet bought a stake in KO for $1.3B. Since the purchase they've make over $7B in dividends and they will receive dividends over $650M just this year alone. 

That's the great thing about shares and fundamentals; it doesn't matter what sediment is, the asset has intrinsic value."

2021-05-26 05:52:56,stocks,"current P/E is meaningless, you should look at FORWARD P/E , or even better, free cash flow because many tech/growth companies will be unprofitable on paper. if you followed your logic of < 100 p/e for a company you wouldnt have bought AMZN since 2005 because it's been 'expensive' the entire time

Zoom, in its last quarter, grew revenue at 368% Y/Y which is incredible. obviously they had some favorable circumstances thanks to covid, and it will hard to repeat that level of growth this year.

regardless, when people start using your company as a verb/noun, aka:

*google it*

*i have to zoom my boss today*

chances are your company is gonna be just fine. and id rather own a company growing at 100%+ growth, whatever the P/E multiple, than a stagnant business"

Its not like I have a ton of experience, although I do work in finance and have 6+ years in the market, it's 50% intelligence/50% emotions. Do not underestimate the significant impact your emotions will have on your total returns. 

Here's one that's counterintuitive: when you first start building a long position in something like AAPL, the only thing you want to happen is for the share price to decrease for the next few months/years. The stock decreasing doesn't mean anything for you (it was a long position) other than the fact that you can buy more at better prices and lower your cost basis. If you weren't planning on realizing the gain/lose and the company is still operating to your bull thesis, then the shares decreasing is only a good thing."

yes i agree that buying Zoom is a bet on whether they can keep up their current growth. 368%? probably not. 50-100%? i think its doable. id say they are trading at 40x FWD P/S right now which is steep but not crazy for growth of that magnitude & profit margins

The news lately has been mostly about continuous monitoring of the impact of inflation and oil prices on stock prices.

Investors seem to have either sold in May and gone away, or they are watching the Q1 news stories play out now, and don‚Äôt really have much more to say about the markets.

3. What are your thoughts about market news lately?

4. I am open to feedback about additional diversification choices.

Thank you in advance!"

With the shares now at around ¬£0.08 and obviously the share price plummeted from the ¬£3.00 pre covid price (I'm assuming largely due to not being able to do anything so no need for cash and also people claiming they were sold something they did not want etc)
Just wondering what you all think?
With everything opening back up I can see more people now especially with job losses etc turning to them for fast cash so might be worth a go?

2021-05-26 00:00:00,stocks,"Investing more than you can afford ...it happens.

 It's a common mistake even experienced investors mistake. I've made it. I guarantee half the people on here who ridicule others for it, have done it. Millionaires have gone bankrupt through bad investments. It isn't just retail traders and lower/middle class who suffer from it. 

Like a lot of people, I used to say I never invest more than I can afford. I believed it because I wasn't looking at the whole of my financial situation and was ignoring major red flags. It's easy to tell yourself you aren't making such a ""rookie"" mistake while ignoring red flags.  If this might be you, consider simple signs you need to pullback:

- you are constantly watching price fluctuations and agonizing over dips. This happens because you can't afford to lose what you've put in which means you've put too much in. If you're losing too much time during your day watching stock prices and your job isn't a day trader than you need to lower your investment.

- panic selling at even a small loss. Nothing wrong with putting a stop loss in place but if you're putting one in for a small percent drop, chances are you're terrified of losing more than you can afford. Cut down your stake and you'll find you're able to weather the dips long term

- thinking about your investment as ""money you have"" to boost your confidence in your bank account. If you have $2k in your checking account but tell yourself it's OK because you have $10k in stocks, you are way in over your head. 

Here are some tips I've learned along the way that might help some others:

1. Don't beat yourself up too much or lose too much sleep when you realize you're in a hole. Its fixable and with mitigation, you'll be able to climb back out.

2. DON'T double down and try to recoup losses by putting more money you can't afford in. 

3. If you've put in too much and lost a lot, hold past the dip and sell once the stock has recovered to a safe degree. It's extremely rare for a stock to do a permanent  downward slump. Panic selling at the bottom screws you more. If a 50% drop happens and you've lost faith in the stock, wait until it comes up 25% to sell. This obviously is difficult to predict and modular depending on the stock and loss but unless a company is rumored to be going under entirely, you can wait for the buoy.

4. Just because you aren't losing money doesn't mean you aren't over-investing. Even if you're seeing gains but you're living paycheck to paycheck, you are over-invested. Stocks aren't a substitute for a savings account or as a holding place for all your extra funds. Its easy to placate out of that thinking when the going is good but that's how people get royally screwed. Even if it hurts, sell what you need to in order to get right financially. You might see fewer gains but you'll sleep better st night 

5. Make a gated checkpoint system of what you invest. For example, 20% of your paycheck goes into savings. 30% of your monthly savings account goes into investments. Find a number thats safe for you.

6. Last but not least, always imagine your investment is a vacation. A lot of people say ""assume it's money down the drain,"" but I disagree with this from a psychological standpoint. If you're active in trading, it's hard to simply view the money as gone. Imagine you're planning a vacation and the money you're putting in is what you're spending. You obviously want a nice vacation but no one spends their life savings on a vacation (unless you're dying in which case go nuts). Some vacations end up being worth the money and some end up a disappointment, but you don't ruin your financial life by taking a vacation and buying stocks should be no different.

Your perspective is little different from which you disagree with, honestly neither belongs to a serious investor.

Investing, like any other activity you do purposefully, should be taken seriously.
You don‚Äôt go to college thinking you won‚Äôt learn anything. Don‚Äôt apply for a job expecting to get fired. Investing is no different.

The mindset of failure justifies who is mostly after the excitement and fun, to gamble and maybe win something nice. Comparing it to a vacation underscores it‚Äôs seen as a play for enjoyment rather than work for productivity.

If you have $5k in the bank and $40k in stocks and a repeat of the pandemic happened next month (you lose your job and the market crashes 80%) how long could you wait for the market to pick back up without having to pull that money out? My personal opinion is to have six months of savings that could keep you afloat jobless and with a market crash. It's easy to think another pandemic or recession wouldn't happen so soon but it's always possible, and there are other market disruptors such as war, natural disasters and political upheaval that you should keep in mind.

The planning is a combination of thoughtful hard work and excitement as well as careful budgeting to ensure maximum return without overspending. The big thing in that analogy is about spending.

You might have to postpone the house purchase for a couple of years while you regrow your down payment money.

It's true that keeping a large chunk of money in a savings account with a near-zero interest rate for a few years is suboptimal because it will lose value as a result of inflation, but you also have no worries about how much money will be available when it's needed.

2021-05-26 09:58:38,stocks,"I think the issue there is it sounds like they were invested in real estate and highly leveraged. Leverage can bankrupt you.

Suppose instead of buying properties directly, you invested in REITs(which have their own leverage internally) via Vanguard's VNQ, but didn't use any margin/leverage yourself to buy them. Worst case scenario, If you bought right at the very peak, and panic sold right at the very bottom, you would've lost 75% on price. In practice it would've been a bit lower due to dividends, maybe 65-70%.

That's the strength of not borrowing money and just buying shares with money you own, and letting the corporate entity borrow. You aren't the one personally liable for the leverage on the investments. If the company goes bankrupt, the lenders will get first priority on being paid, but they can't go after shareholders assets. So the most you can lose on such an investment is everything, but even then, if diversified across many stocks, there should still be something left from companies that are still alive unless the entire market economy disappears like when the soviet union was formed.

Also part of why I'm invested in REIT indexes, they're pretty resilient. They benefit from cheap money to grow, they return capital to shareholders regularly, and if they do go under, I'm not the one stuck with a mortgage on a worthless property."

If you have 500k in the bank and can coast comfortably should a market crash occur and you lose your job then it might not be a huge risk. There are always risks to a market but the pandemic should stand out as a huge example of how even short term crashes can bankrupt someone. If you lost your job suddenly and then a crash occurred and that margin debt comes calling could you safely cover it and be able to live? This is how a lot of people go under during market crashes.

2021-05-26 10:57:43,stocks,"https://www.propertychronicle.com/reits-recessions-a-historical-reminder/

REITs were worse hit during the recession than the stock market and were how a lot of people got burned. The great recession basically disproved the notion of safe REITs. They recovered, sure, but not everyone could afford to wait for recovery and losing 50% of your entire net worth will cripple you if your living expenses exceed what those losses will cover.

The examples here and the whole point of the post is that panic selling isn't the only reason people end up needing to sell. Many that overextend themselves believe that in a crisis they can just pull the money out like a savings account but they fail to consider that economic crashes often result in job losses as well and don't maintain emergency liquid assets. 

Using the 50% loss model, let's say you have 50k in stocks, 5k in the bank and on average you need 8k a month for living expenses (we live in LA so 8k is a pretty normal number). Crash occurs, you lose your job and have no income coming in, and now you have 25k in stocks that won't recover for another year or more. By the end of the month you'll need to withdraw at least 3k. Even with unemployment which pays maybe 1k a month, you would need to sell nearly all your assets at a 50% loss just to stay afloat within a matter of months. When people say don't invest more than you can afford to lose this is what we're talking about. Too many people think they can afford to lose their savings because the depend on their job to continually bring in income and just assume they'll be able to make up the loss eventually."

2021-05-26 10:15:26,stocks,"I'm not going to argue that margin can't enhance returns, because it can.

The argument I'm making is it eliminates your ability to stick with a plan. If you have a strong risk appetite, you can go 100% stocks, no bonds or cash, and that's your right. If your time horizon is 20+ years, you can literally just ignore the daily price swings because they mean nothing to you. Same with if you use your portfolio for income but have no intention of selling. If you know your stocks pay $x in dividends every 3 months, you can plan around that regardless of price swings.

But the moment you introduce margin into your portfolio, those price swings become very relevant, and you give up control.

It's for that reason that I consider 100% equities the maximum risk exposure a retail investor should take. 

If you're comfortable taking on additional risk and want to enhance returns beyond 100% equities, IMO you'd be better off factor investing with value stocks, perhaps with weighting towards small cap, which has higher historical returns than the SP500. That would provide better risk adjusted returns than relying on margin."
2021-05-26 19:25:08,stocks,Seems you've got a pretty good selection and area of expertise. Railroads are definitely one area that's quite stable against both a recession and industry disruption. I might even pick up one of your holdings.
2021-05-26 00:00:00,stocks,"How to get over ‚Äúaveraging up‚Äù in index funds? So I have a good chunk of my portfolio in individual stocks but I would like a majority of my portfolio in VTI. With that said, my average cost of VTI is going up, since I DCA ever month regardless of price. 

This makes me a little discouraged since I feel like I am not getting a good average cost as is it going up constantly. As a fellow DCA type of guy, is this not a good plan?"
2021-05-26 10:11:20,stocks,I‚Äôve never seen someone come up with price targets for macro bets. I‚Äôd love to see someone‚Äôs dcf on a S&P index. That seems ridiculous to attempt to do lmao
2021-05-25 23:21:52,stocks,"The reason is the graph only assumes buying at the bottom with new money, a lot of people think of perfect market timing in terms of selling at the top the  rebuying at the bottom. But this is pretty much impossible to do so steady contributions are the best either way."
2021-05-26 00:00:00,stocks,"People say you should buy into the market piece by piece, does the same hold true for selling? So I'm quite new at this, started investing like a week before the whole GME thing (unfortunately didn't buy any though). Advice I've gotten has said to buy into the market piece by piece, slowly over time and I've been following it. When it comes to selling I've assumed I'd just sell everything I had in a stock once it went up enough but then I thought ""well what if I sell it off piece by piece"". Specifically I have a +$150 return on 22nd Century Group Inc so I sold $130 worth of it. I figure if it continues to climb sure I'll make a bit less money but if it crashes (which I don't think is likely but you never know) I'll lose less and if it dips but looks like it'll come back up I can use the money from the sale to buy more. I know that sounds like I'm trying to time the market which is foolish but this is motivated more by wanting to actually secure the money I make from my investments rather then watch the money number go up only for it to drop like a rock before I actually get any of it out. So is this a viable strategy or am I totally off the mark here?"

And based on ur reply, look at how taxes work.. Its all over the internet"
2021-05-25 21:13:04,stocks,I always sell them within the year.   I've been making trades in my dad's account which I have to deduct 37% for taxes...lots of money in that account..  I've been just deducting 37% from every gain that I sold.  And he pays the taxes.   A lot of the trades  I also have losses on.. Some I have more previous losses than the Current gains.  Should I still be deducting the 37% from those capital gains?

2021-05-26 03:30:37,stocks,The only news i want to hear about amazon is stock split
2021-05-26 05:14:45,stocks,I was going to buy guitar picks on Amazon yesturday. I learned my lesson to check reviews after being burned to many times. Sure enough a couple people complained that the picks felt/looked like fakes. I decided to look for another place to purchase. And found that the real picks were 10 dollars cheaper on Sweetwater.com. and they weren't even on sale. Amazon is still riding the wave of being a reputable online market. Can't see that lasting much longer.
2021-05-26 08:17:26,stocks,"Their product pages are garbage now, all sponsored ads. Can't find any organic suggestions anymore. I shop Amazon less now"

I really do not get it.   Why are these companies delaying the splits?"

2021-05-25 20:52:15,stocks,"I doubt if they still care much about their e-commerce business. They care about AWS and other stuffs. Yes, like you say, I cannot trust many of the listings and the user  comments. I only buy well known items from well known brands at Amazon."

2021-05-25 22:02:58,stocks,This is what I use Amazon for these days. You can't find some items anywhere else with such  fast shipping. I do wish Amazon has more sold by Amazon stuff but I think they would rather make money from FBA than managing the inventory themselves.
2021-05-25 21:50:13,stocks,I didn't even know Amazon ran adds because of this lol

2021-05-25 20:59:35,stocks,"I would say it's all the sponsored products where they pay to get bumped up to top of the page. Amazon has become too shady for my liking if you wander outside the well known brand names.  The reviews are usually fake, only the 1 or 2 star reviews seem to be a better description for all the sponsored products."

2021-05-25 21:59:46,stocks,"Wrong... I am an amazon 3rd party seller, and I will bet my entire amazon buisness that it is very sustainable...

It should be lots more sustainable than twitter, etc, as amazon's advertising has a higher conversion rate, as people are on amazon to buy shit, people on twitter may not click on your add or not buy anything cause their tweeting etc....

Furthermore, buisnesses are very complicated, on an item with COGS 30%, lets say 10% amazon category fee, 20% shipping, thats still a 40% profit zone, where even if adds was 20% ACOS, you can have a 20% profit, and a COGS of 30% is typically an industry standard of an ok / average product. your claim that random chinese sellers bidding shit up is unfounded. I dont really click on ads at all, but someone else who does that can perform an empircal experinment and click on the ads and look at the seller profile page which lists the address of the buisness and their LLC name, which you can google and deduce if their chinese or not...

**Also, even if you have ad traffic, you may not get sales / conversions if your product is crappy thanks to bad reviews and just crappy looking products in the photo...**"
2021-05-26 01:10:41,stocks,I don't know how you idiots can't find what you're looking for on Amazon.
2021-05-26 06:27:03,stocks,"Fuck Etsy tho. They have the same problem if not worse. Tons of dropshipped and mass produced shit. The sellers have warehouses outside customs hubs so their listings show they ship from the US but it takes 1-3 weeks. That first week is them shipping from China to the US and then it gets packaged and shipped to the customer. It‚Äôs a big scam and is ruining the platform.

Shopify is legit tho."
2021-05-26 02:37:25,stocks,Newegg just ipo'd the other day
2021-05-25 21:06:27,stocks,"The problem with Shopify is that the businesses eventually learn the ridiculous complexities of sales tax and income tax they must comply with after the Wayfair vs South Dakota case a few years ago. Once you have sales tax accounts many states aggressively require income tax filings too. Then there are 100's of other miscellaneous taxes different states have that you now have to comply with. Even a small seller will be at $50k a year in compliance cost.

Instead, most ecom business owners I know have switched completely to 3rd party marketplaces. The marketplace collects the sales tax for you. States have no incentive to pursue you for not filing $0 sales tax returns. Without sales tax accounts you can avoid income tax concerns too.

Companies that run their own store on Shopify and opt to collect only in their home state will be in for a nasty surprise when California, Pennsylvania, Washington or a number of other aggressive states find out. Sales tax adds up fast."

They no doubt will still be a popular site. But if they don't stop allowing fake reviews and fake products to be purchased they are going to lose many customers.

2021-05-25 22:51:22,stocks,"I sometimes still buy electronics on Amazon for the free shipping, the fact that I always have a ton of Amazon gift cards, etc, but I absolutely do my due diligence on the seller before pulling the trigger on anything."

2021-05-25 23:12:44,stocks,It was so much better 5 years ago. You could get quality products that always beat competitive prices and decent shipping time. I won't buy anything from them anymore unless its something I've been buying or something basic. Even yesterday I saw a deal on American Crew hair products and all the recent reviews were how it was a fake product.
2021-05-26 17:12:46,stocks,How are some of those folks on r/FulfillmentByAmazon making it work? I was thinking about getting into this in my professional niche but I hear so many of these horror stories
2021-05-25 20:19:59,stocks,"This exactly. I switched to Target during the pandemic. They offer free two-day shipping without a membership, and their product quality has never disappointed me. Even the in-house brands (Good and Gather, All in Motion, etc.) are surprisingly great. I was a long time holder and am even more bullish now than I was when the stock was trading at half of what it is today. I low key think retail is going to make an enormous comeback post-Covid. People want to get out."
2021-05-26 17:15:06,stocks,Agreed. I guess we don't buy obscure trinkets like some people on here. I definitely find value in Amazon.

2021-05-25 21:17:42,stocks,"Yes it's a very successful corporation which is making amounts of money that they should be taxed far more on. But they're not anticompetitive because they have powerful competitors who don't cooperate in each space they're in - ecommerce (ebay, alibaba,  pinterest and more), retail b&m (walmart, target, costco - no slouches), digital advertising (Facebook, Google)... and most of all AWS. 

as for whether I have no idea what antitrust or anticompetitive behavior is, then ok if you say do lmao. I've worked in M&A and corporate litigation but OK.

Even a shitty lawyer would get the joke litigation argument that it's a monopoly thrown out with ease"
2021-05-26 14:33:48,stocks,The quality of the eBay shopping experience has gone down even worse than Amazon's shopping experience in my experience.

2021-05-25 22:55:55,stocks,"Same thing with mini PCs; I was considering getting something for my entertainment center so I could have a browser and a few other things I can't get natively on my Vizio TV, plus my living room looks way nicer than my home office for video calls, etc, etc. It was awful trying to look through everything and compare. 

(I ended up deciding it wasn't worthwhile, not because of the Chinese crap, but because of the current prices; if I were to find a good deal on an Acer chromebox, or a *really* good deal on a Chromebit, I'd be all over it.)"
2021-05-26 17:21:12,stocks,"Unless you have a new product idea, or you can somehow differentiate your product or brand in some new way, then it is a guaranteed money loser. The people who are making money on 
r/fulfillmentbyamazon either got in way back at the beginning so they have thousands of five star reviews, or they have a unique product. You simply cannot complete with Chinese sellers, because they can sell the product for what you would pay for it after all costs are tallied."
2021-05-25 23:09:47,stocks,"That's what Amazon has mostly always been. Certainly in the last decade.

Most everything is made in China, but only in last few years Chinese companies are trying to cut out the middlemen which are the thousands of private label amazon businesses."

I said Amazon has a significant amount of market power. They teach you that in M&A or is this your lack of knowledge of the subject matter showing?

The embarrassing part is you chiming in and not doing your own homework. Go home."
2021-05-25 22:34:00,stocks,"I work in corporate there and can tell you in no uncertain terms, but also in no detail, that I believe it would be a better run set of companies if it were broken up--though the number of ventures would decrease."
2021-05-25 21:22:19,stocks,"No offense that says more about you as an investor than anything else. AWS has been Amazon's juggernaut for nearly a decade, it shits on GCP, and it's by far the backbone of the internet compared to any other provider. Little to no reason to not know what it is, if you invest in tech even a little bit.

If you're a 100% index fund investor who doesn't follow big tech then this doesn't apply though."
2021-05-26 15:50:17,stocks,I find the opposite. At least eBay doesn't clump together reviews and doesn't hide where the seller is located.
2021-05-26 17:53:46,stocks,"Oh, thanks for the tip!"
2021-05-25 22:19:58,stocks,AWS should be split away from Amazon.
2021-05-25 22:16:03,stocks,Car parts? Try rock auto. My brother is a mechanic and swears by it.
2021-05-25 23:56:25,stocks,"Exactly. It seemed like the shipping times had been fixed after about August or so. Lately, processing times have been twice as long as shipping if I get two day at all. I really think that the last item that I ordered that came in a timely manner was my PS5 back in November. Everything since has been super slow."
2021-05-25 21:24:39,stocks," Let's make a bet. None of Google, Amazon, Facebook will be broken up in the next 4 years. You must be out of your mind to say the fact amazon has significant market power directly asserts they should be broken up. 

Amazon has significant market power... so does coca cola. You think ""a significant amount of market power"" is enough for antitrust? 

Your neanderthal ass probably thinks that's a monopoly too. Just stop embarrassing yourself, or actually keep going, it's entertaining lmfao"
2021-05-26 06:29:45,stocks,"I think that makes a lot of sense, as an outsider. AWS has godlike margins - almost on the level of Google, or Facebook.

The rest of amazon has transformed from a massive loss bleeder, into profitable. Extremely impressive especially when you compare to Google who could not turn many ventures into profitable business avenues."
2021-05-26 05:30:31,stocks,"I haven't done any of my own picks before this year so I've been pretty oblivious. I used to just give my money to someone else to manage.

2021-05-25 21:26:08,stocks,"Bro, wtf are you even talking about. It‚Äôs a discussion of ‚Äúif‚Äù they should be broken up. Not when. Why would I make a bet on when? That‚Äôs dumb and it‚Äôs up to the ftc to bring a case , which is probably more political than anything. That‚Äôs not even the discussion I‚Äôm having. And you sir, need a new career."
2021-05-26 06:00:45,stocks,"Gotcha my man, I apologize for my post, I didn't mean to be rude about it. I edited my post above.  AWS actually hosts about 1/3rd of the internet, at least of the top 80% of web traffic. 

Google Cloud is more customizable and more powerful/""better"" in a technical sense. Microsoft Azure does decent business as well as IBM cloud. MSFT/IBM are more for larger enterprises or legacy business. 

 Amazon has enough of a first mover advantage to surpass everyone considerably. Companies from Netflix to ESPN to other tech giants like FB or MSFT use AWS, startups use AWS, midsize companies use aws. It's so ubiquitous no one would ever say ""We use AWS"". AWS is also where Amazon has its biggest profit margins. 

Once again I apologize to have been such a cunt in my response, and happy to answer any other questions about AWS or cloud technologies in general"
2021-05-26 03:00:04,stocks,"Additionally, at least for me, paying a bit more but getting it in fewer than 30 days is a big plus, too."
2021-05-26 10:39:07,stocks,Nice!
2021-05-26 08:01:11,stocks,more cheap tat for you
2021-05-25 21:27:42,stocks,"Yeah, they shouldn't be broken up because they aren't a monopoly. Neither AWS nor their retail business is a monopoly. You definitely need a different career if your current  one requires any critical thinking skills or reading comprehension, because you are sorely lacking in both."
2021-05-26 13:02:53,stocks,"Oh I didn't think it was rude at all lol. 

I had no idea amazon had that kind of stake in that market. That's good to know though. Maybe I'll have to look into it more and see everything they offer."
2021-05-25 21:28:56,stocks,You‚Äôve come to the discussion thinking I‚Äôve said Amazon is a monopoly and needs to be broken up. That‚Äôs not the argument I‚Äôm making. Re-read.
2021-05-25 21:32:08,stocks,"Omg you seriously cannot even read, and have edited your comments so I can‚Äôt even keep up.

I‚Äôll say for the last time. Amazon is not a monopoly. Again just so your dumbass can follow.

Amazon is not a monopoly.

However Amazon has significant and durable market power. But you‚Äôre not an expert in antitrust so this argument and logic is lost on you."

Holy shit, sorry  didn't mean to engage with someone with severe memory issues or at best wants to play semantics games.

You: 


> Amazon is a shining example of a 21st firm that is anticompetitive and should be broken up for the best interests of not only the stockholders but society.

I'm out, you literally can't remember what you just said moments ago, thanks for the laughter though."
2021-05-25 21:34:17,stocks,Hahahahaha. You have no argument at all. Having durable market power doesn't imply anticompetitiveness. You're just talking nonsense.
2021-05-25 21:33:40,stocks,"I‚Äôm glad your out. God willing you quit being a litigator and go back to school.  

Btw even in your quote I don‚Äôt say Amazon is monopolist ü§£ü§£"
2021-05-25 21:37:44,stocks,"I didn‚Äôt imply that. You did. 

Bro, you need to do some basic fundamentals in reading comprehension. You‚Äôre creating your own narrative."

The house report that claimed Apple had abusive levels of market power (fucking Apple, lmfao) while turning a completely blind eye to  ISPs like Comcast or Banks like any of them. Yeah big tech is the problem though according to you and should be broken up. And how does one break up AWS which runs 1/3rd of the (western) internet? Let me guess you haven't thought through it that far."

And that‚Äôs exactly question you should be asking, which I‚Äôm glad you asked it. I haven‚Äôt thought that far, that not my job. My only job is to point out the dangers of owning 1/3 of the internet. If you read Talebs book about anitfragility, this is prime example something we should want to be anitfragile, because 1 company owning 1/3 of the internet is something we shouldn‚Äôt want."
2021-05-25 22:29:54,stocks,"A Taleb disciple lmfao. No wonder you are so self righteous. 

Why are you so twisted on Amazon and not Comcast or Coca Cola? You expect me to think Amazon should be a focus before them, or any of a number of financial institutions? They own more than 1/3rd of their respective markets in the former cases 


And Amazon doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúown‚Äù the internet. AWS is the most economical option and most widely used cloud hosting service in the west but Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure have higher growth rates. Not sure if you have heard of Google and Microsoft but they are in fact large companies which make your ‚ÄúAmazon has too much power wahhhh‚Äù argument nonsensical. 

AWS is king because of a first mover advantage. Users have plenty of alternatives and in fact GCP is cheaper now for most users. So if your job is pointing out the dangers of one company owning a third of (western, not global) Internet, and you are citing this as an example
of antifragility.... well, you should take your own advice when you said earlier to find a new job lmao"

I‚Äôm not bent on Amazon, did you forget the name of the article were commenting on? 

Coca-Cola? If you knew what a monopoly was, you wouldn‚Äôt mention them.

Comcast, there could be a stronger case there.

Again, I don‚Äôt think you understand what a monopoly is, or what market power is(as defined by the ftc).

You‚Äôve come here defending Amazon like some sort of fanboy claiming they shouldn‚Äôt be broken up, yet the committee who‚Äôs job it is to break up monopolies has brought forth the exact complaint I‚Äôm trying to explain to you. But you seem want to argue for argument sake. 

You want proof, I gave it you. You don‚Äôt seem to grasp what a monopoly is or seem to know what you‚Äôre talking about so I‚Äôm gonna stop. All I‚Äôll say is read some of the article out there. There‚Äôs some great reporting on the subject matter. The 450 page released by the house sub committee is out there too if you want more details. 

Amy klobuchar also released a book on antitrust as well. So there‚Äôs lots information out there for you to catch-up on if you actually want to have a discussion. Other than that, you speaking out ya ass."
2021-05-26 01:27:09,stocks,"You didn‚Äôt give proof. You cited the same source as the people who asked Zuckerberg how Facebook makes money if the product is free. The fact you think the House of Representatives understands technology companies is hilarious though.

And you just seem to hate Amazon. I‚Äôm no fanboy; The argument I make is the same I make for Facebook and Google. Regularly, people who know less than zero like yourself talk complete bullshit because you don‚Äôt know anything, and try to claim FB, Google, and Amazon are overly powerful in their respective markets. Which already doesn‚Äôt make sense since they all compete with each other.

And the fact you pretend to have studied any of this, or have any clue about tech companies or trusts, monopolies, and market power is the best part of it all üòÇ"

We used to have a ESPP program and it was the best thing ever.  You got to buy at the lowest price on Jan 1 or June 30 and then a 15% discount.  I put everything I could into this and made some real money and built my original trading account which has grown over the years.

The main reason stock splits (reverse or not) happen is to impact the price. And there this can have multiple reasons. The leading one is to make the stock more affordable (but has been less impactful since the rise of fractional shares), but another main factor is for listing/uplisting, e.g. the Dow Jones is a perfect example where a listing of Amazon in it's current state would completely upset it.

2021-05-26 05:10:42,stocks,"Okay, your comment is clearly so based on false information that I'll break a few of them down.

> Apple also manages good returns despite having a horrible market share for computers, yet profitable.

Apple's returns come from their sticky products and software revenues, exactly the same business model Tesla is going after. On the other hand, Tesla is exactly the opposite of Apple. Apple is the premium brand with great products, but much worse specs than the competition for a higher price. Tesla is the premium brand with great products, but much better specs than the competition for the same price.

> Tesla for one has had a few good years with minimal competition and easy life, though nowadays everyone is going electric and fast!

This is an easy way to make it sound like that would be terrible for Tesla, but it only matters if others are actually making better cars, which they are not.

> Tesla has been unable to keep their lead in both technology, car quality or marketshare.

Let's break them down one by one:

* Tesla is clearly still miles ahead in terms of technology. Anyone who's serious can see that, but in case you're somehow to blinded by misinformation to realize this just look at the fact that the Cybertruck beats the electric Hummer and F150 in every single spec for the same price.
* Tesla has never been in the lead in terms of car quality, but they've been rapidly increasing their car quality and have already jumped ahead in some areas this year, with the single-piece casting of the underbody and their superior electrical wiring for example.
* Market share is largely irrelevant, as no company can maintain their market share when their market had no other brands competing before to lots of people competing today. As long as Tesla is selling every car they make, what matters is not their EV market share but their overall automotive market share, and here Tesla is still rapidly gaining ground.

> Their cars are getting more problems and start to get a tarnished reputation (the other day they had their own ""battery gate"").

This is absolute BS. Tesla has had negative press from the start and it's not getting better or worse, it's just misinformation from media that want to tarnish Tesla's reputation because they don't do advertising and they'll hurt the media's business model if they succeed. Stories like the ""failing brakes"" in China recently are quickly proven false, but the stories stick because people are more interested in negative stories than positive. Ultimately this doesn't matter though, as people will realize they're BS when they hear from friends and families how great their Tesla is.

> Their driving assistance has not outperformed the competition in any test done by a objective third party, on the contrary.

Completely false. While their are some third parties that are funded by other brands (such as Consumer Reports which is largely funded by Ford) and naturally lean towards the companies funding them, the actually independent parties all rank Tesla's driving assistance as the best, although it's often masked by bringing other factors into the overall scoring to make Tesla not the overall winner (again because of the advertising argument).

> And their marketshare in Europe in general and Norway in particular is deep red.

Cherry picking one continent or even country is extremely shady, especially because Tesla doesn't even have a factory in Europe yet.

> Elon going to China to try to butter up Xi Jinping by praising the dictator is a show of fear.

Lol, extremely subjective speculation...

> Tesla is bleeding in Europe, they need a new market...one with less competitors

Already answered this. Total bs as long as they're selling every car they make and scaling like crazy."

Airlines just have a completely different business model, different overheads, different structure, different technologies, etc. The only thing you're comparing is the fact that they both happen to fly, and even then, again, they use different technologies for that.

> While you can charge higher prices for experiences, if your costs skyrocket too, you still don't make money.

The higher prices that they charge ostensibly cover costs with plenty to profit. Do you think they would be investing so many millions of dollars into creating this technology and developing it if they didn't have something as simple as their profit margins figured out? 

To go back to the skydiving example (which literally does include the high costs of traveling in a plane btw), it would not be profitable to charge people standard travel prices when they're cranking a high performance plane up to 10,000 feet and back multiple times a day (which is extremely taxing on the engine and airframe). The only way they're profitable is by charging people usually a bare minimum of ~$250 for that 10 minute experience, which they do, and are wildly profitable by doing so."

>  People don't pay to get an adrenaline kick

But... they do.

> because it is not their own money, they raised a huge amount by going public

The money they raised by going public is their own money though, they can do whatever they want with it. Case in point, Chamath selling his shares for profit, as well as Branson selling some of his to cover Virgin group losses. They could just liquidate right now for huge profits instead of burning money if they didn't think the business would be even more profitable in the future. 

When skydiving was first a thing it was probably waaay more expensive than it is now. I'm sure there was only a tiny market for skydiving when parachute technology was new and it wasn't considered totally safe. Costs came down eventually because the technology and process were refined."

Let‚Äôs say Apple did a 4:1 split. It‚Äôs now a $25 stock that pays a $0.50 dividend, you own 4 shares.

After dividend reinvestment you will have 4.08 shares worth of Apple.

2021-05-25 21:27:49,stocks,"Here are key characteristics to consider:

* Mutual Fund: There are a lot more of these with different themes, styles, objectives. They are actively managed, so they carry higher management fees. Buying through an advisor also carry 12-B1, load fees, and other BS. THEY ARE TAXED ANNUALLY
   * Index Mutual Funds: the subgroup with single objective: Find a benchmark and replicate it. Fees are a lot lower and more accessible. still TAXED ANNUALLY
* ETFs: There are very few ""active"" ETFs, majority of them are index ETFs. Just like Mutual Funds with their objectives, but they are TAXED ONLY AT THE POINT OF SELL.

Personally I do favor ETFs because of the tax advantages. There are some styles that are only available in Indexed Mutual Funds, so I'll take those. For your time horizon of 20-25 years before before you start withdrawing from this portfolio. You can still apply a long time horizon type of allocations. These are the metrics I go by with allocations:

1. Asset Class: stay with the standard: Bond vs Stock - 10/90 or 15/85 is good
2. Region: US vs Euro vs Asia - within equity I tried to maintain a 40% US vs 60% Euro/Asia
   1. Developed vs Emerging: Minor, but Emerging has a higher expected return however higher risk
3. Market Cap: This is harder to manage with Funds/ETFs, so they can only be tilted so much. 
4. Value vs Growth: This is very minor now.....optional

I personally rely on morningstar because they have a vast database on the fund's mix and metrics. [https://www.morningstar.com/etfs/arcx/spy/portfolio](https://www.morningstar.com/etfs/arcx/spy/portfolio)

* Avoid ETFs with weird names and weird Tickers like YOLO or ROBO etfs that starts with ""ARK"". I won't get into the boring details about the darkside of ETF

2021-05-26 19:32:06,stocks,"No i didnt. Go back and re-read. 

I said the current tech (MT) will not be able to do it without major concessions/limitations (thus rendering moot) or a human behind the wheel (which is even more moot). There are >> NO << examples of it working otherwise, not even the one you linked above and there is still a very high chance of that failing too in terms of profit. Odds are, the big ones from Tesla, Waymo and others will not work either. Uber already gave up, and Google is spinning it off because they likely dont want to deal with the debt nor liability.

The current tech is not good enough."

Gt40 wasn‚Äôt because Ford wanted to build another Ferrari, they built it to win at lemans, Ferrari happens to be in the way."

2021-05-25 20:21:20,stocks,"Out of curiosity do you not like REIT dividends because of the tax structure? I've never felt I paid more but I could see where some people might. 

On the ford subject, yeah its a risk. I find Ford fascinating because much of what you said against them could be said about most auto companies. Ford might not have amazing products but every manufacturer has had serious recalls to be concerned about. Tesla has been a champ at damage control but their products have faced serious accusations lately. Look at the latest EU fines getting thrown at them over battery manipulation. I think that's just the tip of the iceberg for tesla. On a sidebar, I think part of why Musk has been so desperate to be in the headlines lately is because there are design flaws in the cars, and the company has serious debt and management issues that are all starting to come out of the woodwork.

Ultimately the reason I like Ford is that the stock is not where it should be based on their financials and I like the signs of their new leadership. Which means if it can move, it'll move well. But yeah total unknown on if it will.  They're my fave in terms of fascinating sentiment. I have a theory about the psychology behind a lot of this and how Ford does over the next five will prove or disprove this lol."
2021-05-26 02:03:28,stocks,"all good points. I wonder how the F-150 can get a range of 300 miles. That is A LOT. I also wonder how Ford is going to handle charging - will there be supercharge stations like Tesla has? But for sure there is a lot of good that Ford has and their trucks are like an American symbol of pride and toughness. So that is an advantage too. And the pictures they released with the truck having all the plug outlets and cargo space and yet retaining its tough and rigid look were all very impressive. We shall see what happens.

Yeah REIT i was referring to tax structure. Here is an explanation I found when googling:

 https://www.debtfreedr.com/pros-and-cons-of-reits/: 

""The federal government taxes dividends at a lower rate than ordinary income but that dividend tax benefit doesn‚Äôt apply to REIT holdings.  
Because of this, most advisors recommend holding REITs within tax-deferred accounts (401(k), IRAs, etc.) due to the fact that REIT dividends are considered ordinary income on tax returns."""
2021-05-26 10:24:17,stocks,"Ford is a such a crazy interesting case study. The new ceo seems to be taking a lot of lessons in what not to do from the old ceo which is great because humility and ability to learn are key to avoiding huge missteps. I could be totally wrong but I think part of why this announcement took so long is because they were trying to work out bugs and other potential engineering issues. They will absolutely have to make charging accessible as truck buyers who prefer f150s will probably not like an inconvenience like how to charge. Luckily though, most trucks aren't used for long distances so at home charging may be appealing enough. I do also love that they partnered with an established EV company which I think will avoid any big battery issues that could cause a recall. 

As for RWT, I've held them for years and never noticed an extreme difference during tax season and my accountant has never mentioned anything but its entirely possible I don't own enough to really feel the difference. Originally I bought the stock because it's a quiet steady grower but I've also gotten decent dividends. I like it now because like UAL it shows potential to return to prepandemic levels. So many other stocks seem hyperinflated well past their 2019 levels im inclined to stick with one's that seem undervalued"
2021-05-26 11:36:04,stocks,Seriously?? Then how come all the advise I‚Äôve seen online says to watch out for annual/quarterly financials?
2021-05-26 14:12:16,stocks,"That isn't the market, that is annuals and quarterly..

The market is the day to day stock transactions, the stock market..

This is to say, markets, for know reason will devalue or undervalue companies...So they can chase the ""Flavor of the year"" investments..that will bomb faster than the rose...."
2021-05-26 14:30:10,stocks,I see thank you for the explanation!

2021-05-26 17:02:52,stocks,Agree. Just buy more GOOD profitable companies.  Invest now. I say optimism is the only realism.  If the market tanks buy more and hold what you have.  Just make sure they are growing profitable companies.
