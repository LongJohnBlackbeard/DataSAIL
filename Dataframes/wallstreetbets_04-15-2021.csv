Either way, Aphria holders are getting the shaft. The low price of Aphria will get people to buy at a discount and raise the volume and price while Tilray continues to tank due to zero incentive to buy Tilray."
2021-04-15 19:32:31,wallstreetbets,"Whatever, I‚Äôm on the spectrum so I‚Äôm probably still going to buy another 100 shares of Aphria (APHA) tomorrow no matter what! YOLO!"

2021-04-15 19:44:14,wallstreetbets,Shareholders of APHA will get .83 shares TLRY per share of APHA (which will no longer exist). Expect market to price out any arbitrage profit here prior to merger.

The subject line is we love Massachusetts and our Massachusetts customers.

You may have heard some news about Massachusetts regulators and Robinhood.
We strongly reject the unfounded allegations made against us and are defending against this meritless action. We fully intend to continue serving our Massachusetts customers.
To be clear: today‚Äôs news has no impact on your account.
You can learn more about what‚Äôs going in our blog post and get the facts in our Help Center.
Does this impact the money in my account? 
No, this decision by Massachusetts does not impact your funds. 

Is Robinhood going away for Massachusetts customers? 
We love Massachusetts and our Massachusetts customers, and we fully intend to continue serving you for the long term. We welcome the opportunity to correct the record on both the facts and the law, and expect to prevail in state court.
If I‚Äôm currently a Massachusetts resident, can I still trade? 
Yes. You still have access to your Robinhood account as usual. The pending litigation does not have any impact on your account.
Does this impact customers in any other states?
No. There is also no impact for customers who are not residents of Massachusetts.
Sincerely,
The Robinhood Team"

Broker-dealers have to keep up with changes to state regulations all the time or risk losing their license. If Mass decides that Robinhood isn't faithfully executing their state regulatory duties, they have every right to pull their license.

Mass also generally tends to be very against predatory institutions (things like casinos being built in poor districts for example). They're very adamant about protecting consumers/renters/etc from shitty businesses and it's helped me get out of predatory binds before with gyms/apartments.

&#x200B;

So to say that this sets a scary precedent isn't realistic. Each state and the residents thereof have their own say. And Mass voters tend to vote for these kinds of things."

2021-04-15 19:33:38,wallstreetbets,"Mine did too, but this doesn't have anything to do with that. I don't blame rh or it's execs for  sabotaging a market-breaking event though."

2021-04-15 19:39:13,wallstreetbets,Lmao you have screenshoots of it or if you can copy&paste here the content of it? Curious to read some cringe
2021-04-15 19:46:35,wallstreetbets,"I can see what you're saying, but I disagree, and I'd say the US has disagreed for hundreds of years (considering the FTC being put in place back in 1914). There's a reason why consumer protection laws exist. People are easily manipulated into bad situations. Hell, just look at ya boy Madoff (RIP).  People could've used some protection from him before he fucked everyone over, not after.

Basically what I'm saying is that under your same argument, you could say that people deserved to have the ""freedom"" to get fucked by ponzi/pyramid schemes or any other shady bullshit. Sometimes total ""freedom"" isn't the best idea after all.

&#x200B;

I'd say it sounds like there's a good case for labeling Robinhood as predatory and not consumer-friendly, so I'm certainly not opposed to this Mass agenda."
2021-04-15 19:16:33,wallstreetbets,That's the point that I was trying to make
2021-04-15 19:55:18,wallstreetbets,Well there you go.  You were able to decide on your own without the government forcing the decision on you.
2021-04-15 19:51:48,wallstreetbets,[removed]
2021-04-15 19:59:18,wallstreetbets,"Idk man. I don't have any ill will toward rh except about the auto sale of 0dte options. I don't think there are any examples of them promoting ponzi/pyramid schemes. The one criticism on here seems to be that they stopped allowing the purchasing of certain securities in an extraordinary situation, but a lot of other brokerages did the same thing. If you look into their reasoning for it, I find it hard to blame them - and looking at it from a macro perspective, the restriction of trading in that scenario may have prevented broad market consequences. Just look at the UVXY chart for that week, now imagine what would have happened if that situation ran unchecked. 

For anybody who is gonna say, ""I would have been rich and the hedge funds would have been ruined!"": I think that is pretty doubtful, but I'm not privy to alternate universes so I can't say for sure."
2021-04-15 18:03:33,wallstreetbets,"This is not investment advice this is what i traded today. I decided on this because I saw a large dip in TSLA at the open while all 3 indices were strong. I had a slight rebound in mind, so I picked the 705 for the IV and so I wouldn‚Äôt lose too much.  I got in at 9:50 and exited the position at 3:50."

Hence why Biden is grabbing Putin's balls by sanctioning their ass (every so lightly) and why the US continues to sanction every other disrespectful country and destroy their economy. Go ask Iran how their citizens are doing being under sanctions forever. All the good people have left Iran, died, or continue to be smushed under their authoritarian foot.

2021-04-15 18:43:36,wallstreetbets,"This is a bit tangential, but I think that anyone who works for a publicly-traded company should be given shares of that company as a condition of their employment. Hear me out:

One reason for this is that it may incentivize people to work harder, since they would have more of a stake in the company's future success or failure. But secondly, and more importantly - what makes a company 'valuable'? Obviously revenue, profit, growth etc but what's the driving force behind all that?

If you answered human labor, correct! Companies wouldn't be able to generate profit if it weren't for employees putting in their labor power. And workers, through their labor power, add value to the company - which in turn increases the value of it's shares.

BUT! The people who work for the company don't get to reap the results of that which they helped to create. The gains (from the share's value increase) don't go to the employees - they go to the shareholders, who did not put in the blood, sweat and tears that made the gains possible.

Guaranteeing a set number of shares for each employee of a particular company would, in my view, be a good way to ameliorate this disparity.

Dkng has exclusive access to it all.  DKNG will also be allowed to use NFL licensed material.  If you're some novice what product are you going to use?

Opendoor is doubling its footprint from 21 markets to 42 markets in FY2021, which could indicate $10 billion in potential run-rate revenue.

Opendoor is estimating $3.5 billion of revenue for FY2021, but a better baseline revenue for FY2021 is probably around $6.0 billion

Current share price of $19.75 has a lot of upside. If we use $6.0 billion as baseline FY2021 revenue, 5x revenue multiple is about $52 a share. It is $93 a share if we apply FY2022 revenue using management‚Äôs 79% revenue growth from FY2021 numbers.

2021-04-15 17:03:41,wallstreetbets,"Even when it was backed by gold it wasn‚Äôt actually backed by anything.

Wtf value does gold have to you? Are you really going to smelt gold down and make conductors? It literally has a very niche practical use, even if you sell it to someone who can. 

Money must be:
A store of value
Divisible
Exchangeable
Portable
Limited 

All money is only valuable because we all agree it is. It‚Äôs a social construct. Pegging is generally a bad idea unless your economy is fucked by inflation, and even then it‚Äôs still just an arbitrary agreement between governments."

2021-04-15 16:17:50,wallstreetbets,"Heard it actually went fine. Just people sold the stock. Thats fine, I‚Äôll buy for a lower price"

2021-04-15 19:20:57,wallstreetbets,"It does make sense. Everyone buys in before the presentation so they can make money off the positive catalyst, causing the stock to rise, then everyone thinks ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to be smarter than everyone else and lock in these gains‚Äù, causing the stock to drop right before or right after the catalyst. Buy the hype, sell the news, always."

2021-04-15 15:48:26,wallstreetbets,Yes 9 months
2021-04-15 16:26:38,wallstreetbets,"Earnings next month is the only catalyst that can probably make this thing move, but at this rate idk let‚Äôs hope you‚Äôre right for the sake of my calls smh"

Hear me:

You are so right about QS, but so wrong about what will happen next. 

Look at what‚Äôs gone down with the other laughable scam of our recent history: NKLA

You would have thought NKLA would plummet to zero when it was revealed they had no tech and they rolled their truck down a hill to make their video. 

BUT NO!

It turns out, having Billions in market cap is itself worth something. There are vested interests that will prop the price up. They have cash to spend to make something. They will produce rebuttals and cloud the waters further. They will rely on the hopium of the masses if bagholders. 

QS is not going to zero any time soon!!!

EVEN IF THEY ARE A COMPLETE FRAUD THEY ARE ALREADY TOO BIG TO FAIL.

2021-04-15 17:42:31,wallstreetbets,Worth a watch on this topic: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QFgPHzQolU
2021-04-15 17:47:39,wallstreetbets,"First I want to say I'm pretty neutral on QS and have a wait-to-see-what-they-accomplish attitude.

But you can't just point to the response and say that must be true, this is like a he says she says situation. The fact is that QS doesn't have a product and is still in the R&D phase. This is like one of those PhD projects that you don't know for sure if it will work out. 

On the other hand QS is no Theranos. Theranos had a bunch of big names backing it, but almost none of them were people in the field and they had no idea what Theranos was doing apart from the layman explanations that the company was giving them. QS is co-founded by Fritz Prinz at Stanford, where he is an expert on solid state materials and battery materials. I think that being a senior faculty, he has a reputation to protect, especially on a topic in his field. Of course that doesn't guarantee anything but I think it sets them apart from Theranos.

In the end, if you are not well-versed with the physics of the technology itself, then you are kind of blindly investing in a project that you know nothing about, because there are no other ways of evaluating the company (financials etc). You might as well go to the casino."
2021-04-15 16:42:02,wallstreetbets,isn't there like a big lockup period ending this month or next month or something? Which should let some vested interests exit?

2021-04-15 16:04:55,wallstreetbets,"The valuation of QS is stupid at these levels considering they are saying they won‚Äôt have a product until 2025. And that‚Äôs their best assumptions which most of the time are inflated to look better. I‚Äôm not saying QS is a fraud or not, but that aside, the valuation and price action is way too high For a company that only has a concept and no revenues for the next 5 years.

Thicc bee/ Microvast said recently they can make solid state batteries in a lab and its relatively easy, but to make it viable for mass production is really challenging at the moment. And to put it into perspective, microvast currently has a stream of revenue and looking to have 3 active battery plants on 3 continents (currently 2 are live) by next year and its valued at a small fraction of QS even though they have patents for solid state batteries and already making lithium batteries on a mass scale with large orders

Edit: also, another thing I would like to add is that if you‚Äôre ever seen an Elon Musk interview about batteries/production, he said multiple times that MASS PRODUCTION is exponentially harder than making a concept or small scale"

2021-04-15 16:07:01,wallstreetbets,Bill Gates is so rich he dips his toes in basically everything and doesn‚Äôt even make a dent in his net worth.

He can throw 100M here and there and only needs one to work out and makes up for the rest which could be losing investments

2021-04-15 16:22:14,wallstreetbets,"I agree that any valuation is a long way out and SPACs have a large variability because of it. However, to release a report with virtually no confirmation while also having a large short position is the definition of market manipulation. Theranos is the exact reason that companies are expected to display the product in a 3rd party lab just like QS did last week."

2021-04-15 16:01:30,wallstreetbets,"Steven Gnocchi, is that you?"
2021-04-15 19:06:51,wallstreetbets,"I don‚Äôt know if I consider the largest shareholder truly 3rd party as they have a large financial incentive to say yes it works. And before people say something about the 2nd $100M, that‚Äôs based on their initial agreement prior to QS going public. It functioned like an option so that $100M gives them shares worth $750M bringing their total $200M investment to $1.5B... that‚Äôs a lot of incentive to say ‚Äú yes it worked. ‚Äú We also don‚Äôt know the details of what was agreed on to be proven. There could be lots of caveats related to test conditions and such where something less impressive than their most recent claims. 

I‚Äôm not saying quantumscape isn‚Äôt going to be the company that solves the issues as they have more money behind SSBs than anyone other than Toyota , but as someone who‚Äôs been in the solid-state battery field, some of the items mentioned in that report are the same questions/concerns I had when they first released their data. A lot of it is incomplete and some of the statements made in that presentation related to other technology is incorrect. 

I bought into it when it was a SPAC sold on the pop and release of the data which was more underwhelming than I thought it was going to be. I hope they‚Äôre successful , but don‚Äôt know when/if I‚Äôll buy back in. I‚Äôll say the comparisons to Theranos are just stupid though. Every SSB company has promised grand and wonderful things that may not or didn‚Äôt come to fruition, but they‚Äôre not malicious... just probably further from the solution than they give off."

2021-04-15 18:48:35,wallstreetbets,"I understand your argument to be: money will move out of gold and into equities because of improved economic outlook, similar to 2012-2013.

One big difference is that in 2012-2013 the equity and real estate market had bottomed.  Now the equity and real estate markets are raging bulls. 

In 2012-2013 people moved out of expensive gold into cheap equity and real estate.  Now people would be moving out of gold into expensive equity and real estate.  The only way equity and real estate aren't expensive is if we are having massive inflation, but that also favors gold.

For instance, I expect inflation to pop the gold spot price in October due to more high-end spending on luxury goods, but I believe that that is a convergent point for positive correlation."
2021-04-15 16:39:28,wallstreetbets,"Peak to peak prices matter most. I believe that gold spot price will pop in October, but only if it is allowed to fall naturally. When gold bugs band together to sell the country club to support a higher gold spot price because someone said it would go up in the future that stops the bounce because there is not trough to bounce from. So, currently I see a larger than normal group desperately trying to hold the gold spot price thinking they will be the ones to profit, but they are preventing the future potential peak altogether. When there is no down, there is no up. If they continue to do this successfully, then there will be no October pop, instead causing a slow decent to a lower peak, as has happened since the top. Also, if they lose wealth trying to hold, then the October pop won't have their support to reach as high.

Ultimately, I do not believe the gold spot price can be held. I think there are too many pressures. Consequently, I believe the October peak will be limited, but the drop will be bigger and further down due to the persistent  and failed resistance."
2021-04-15 19:04:35,wallstreetbets,"Inflation is not always positively correlated to gold spot price. Other things matter, like demand type, demand timeframe, supply urgency (not simply supply), social and other factors. When inflation is a measure of spending by those with high discretionary income or savings, then it might pop the gold spot price in a low demand & supply market. However, if inflation measures increased prices to the detriment of people with lower income or savings, and the market demand is low or stagnant, then inflation is likely inversely correlated to gold spot price. Remember that gold spot price must reflect a value that can actually sell actual gold. That is why many factors converge or diverge correlation depending on period circustances."
2021-04-15 16:45:14,wallstreetbets,"I know for sure that the 10y rate is not always correlative. There are competing (potential) correlative factors, so the one gold price correlates with changes as market conditions and economic planning changes."
2021-04-15 16:29:32,wallstreetbets,"AUY is my fav gold miner. PAAS is my fav silver, even before it acquired TAHO. I watch GOLD, but don't play it, yet. NEM is off my radar.

Gold miners are very interesting to play. Most of my securities trading knowledge came from fighting in those tough trenches. One thing I learned is to always be ready to leave the trench, because there are a lot of big players in various circles and scales. Banks (as a whole) are one set of powerful players, and banks (as a whole) never lose. Banks are one of the big winners in a recovery.

Have you thought what might happen is banks race to sell gold to raise capital? I don't expect them to play nice with each other after that tens of billions fiasco recently when Goldman Sachs dumped shares to beat other lenders. Have you thought what might happen if gold contract buyers stop buying when they see what the banks are doing?"
2021-04-15 16:49:28,wallstreetbets,"One of the hard lesson that I had to learn while investing in gold based securities in the past was that stock funds, like Direxion does, are strongly affected by investor participation. It is possible for all related funds to go down despite the intended offsetting price structures, because sometimes a lot the participatory capital leaves that space entirely. This happens when there are major changes in recommended portfolio balancing or lucrative other options."
2021-04-15 16:52:13,wallstreetbets,"As a regular for-profit trader, I would never buy physical gold to invest in a gold based investment. Storing value in a physical product reduces liquidity when compared to an individual trading account, and trading only in stocks and options. Buying physical gold takes money out of the market. That only helps others who keep their money in the trading market."

2021-04-15 17:28:58,wallstreetbets,Gold bugs sell the idea of gold always going up by finding a metric with a timeline scaled to appear as if it accurately predicts movement.

Which effectively started in September 2018and peaked in August 2020. From here we are in a yield steepening environment, which is a real yields rising environment.

So talking about gold bugs doesn't matter to me.

Gold should see a slow rise in value over a period from just general price inflation due to shrinking mines and general gold consumption in the EMs, but real moves are over until we see yield curve inversion again."

Also,  there‚Äôs a wild card here. Cattle and other livestock companies are being drove out for a select few to control the beef. Costs of livestock and raising them is quickly if not already blowing up to where there‚Äôs most likely not going to be any new farmers entering this field as they cannot compete with Africa and other countries who are supplying the beef (if it is beef) in the United States. This will be an interesting play to watch unfold over the next few months to years. Additionally I believe Bill Gates is the largest owner of farmland in the USA now and China for some reason is buying up land in the USA including farm land. Gates is working with companies to bring more alternative beef to the plate as they work on the crazy climate change agenda so who knows what changes will be coming soon as is why I‚Äôm

2021-04-15 18:48:51,wallstreetbets,Your first problem was buying calls. I did shares and am happy I did.
2021-04-15 18:54:10,wallstreetbets,You may have just been way late. The DD on this was done about a month and a half back
2021-04-15 18:59:22,wallstreetbets,You still have tomorrow!
2021-04-15 19:03:23,wallstreetbets,Haha I bought some too should have sold them ASAP they were up at the beginning of April. We were too greedy...

2021-04-15 19:12:01,wallstreetbets,My puts are about to expire worthless too if it makes you feel better.
2021-04-15 19:30:38,wallstreetbets,You have to do DD on DD to determine if the DD is actually DD DuhDuh
2021-04-15 19:37:34,wallstreetbets,The DD on WSB is as real as the news on The Onion...
2021-04-15 13:59:15,wallstreetbets,Brrrrr

2021-04-15 13:51:17,wallstreetbets,The first rule of DD is we do not talk about DD
2021-04-15 18:27:50,wallstreetbets,Dungeons and Dragons?
2021-04-15 16:59:52,wallstreetbets,You almost sounded like Carlos Mencia
2021-04-15 19:58:24,wallstreetbets,"I always thought seeing DD next to a ticker on WSB was a bullish sign because I thought it referred to boobs, which are good, aka bullish. Guess I have some positions to unwind..."
2021-04-15 16:11:14,wallstreetbets,"Yo dawg,

I heard you liked DD, so we got together and put some DD in yo DD and now we got a tube of DiDi Seven, yo!"
2021-04-15 18:48:46,wallstreetbets,"Not to mention he bought fucking FDs lmao

Then he blames the DD.

He belongs here"

2021-04-15 13:42:56,wallstreetbets,"Yea these could‚Äôve been sold for a profit during the spike?

Edit: I didn‚Äôt sell mine now they worth like .01 so OP and is as retarded as I am"
2021-04-15 16:04:36,wallstreetbets,"It was a dd that was made a couple days ago, talking about how there was a conference and it was going to moon after."
2021-04-15 17:33:10,wallstreetbets,"Precisely. There was great DD done pre-earnings and I bought in at the dip the day after earnings. Made 1200% on my 30 strike calls, and got out. Hung on to the 35c and lost money on those."
2021-04-15 14:00:40,wallstreetbets,What if the DD says to buy puts?
2021-04-15 14:34:37,wallstreetbets,This. PLTR puts printed moderately.
2021-04-15 14:33:07,wallstreetbets,What if the DD on WSB is to do opposite WSB?
2021-04-15 17:32:55,wallstreetbets,Short everything WSB touches. (Looking at you Melvin)
2021-04-15 17:11:53,wallstreetbets,The real trick is to buy calls and when you see green (because you always do you just hold for the multiple hundred %) switch to puts immediately.
2021-04-15 15:15:05,wallstreetbets,I wonder how many Nigerian princes he's in communication with...
2021-04-15 15:47:31,wallstreetbets,"People hold onto options way too fucking long in this sub. If you‚Äôre reading this, how many times did you buy, go green, then hold too long and have it fall red and sit there hopelessly while it melted value and expired worthless?  
Every post about losses on options follows this trend...  

Treat options like a goddamn hot potato and go horizontal"
2021-04-15 14:38:28,wallstreetbets,"""ThE DD wAs SoUnD"""
2021-04-15 12:58:52,wallstreetbets,I'll just stop expecting to buy into something and have it do anything other than fall off the face of the earth for no reason
2021-04-15 18:04:46,wallstreetbets,"Most of the DD is just looking for suckers to fomo in, watch awhile without taking action and you can see the bs."
2021-04-15 13:34:31,wallstreetbets,I agree to the look who is writing part. But then you stopped making sense ;)
2021-04-15 14:39:53,wallstreetbets,This. Also if they don't have positions or won't post proof of positions.
2021-04-15 17:02:49,wallstreetbets,"Also, if the person is a clear bagholder (ie. posted the DD AFTER his position incurred in heavy loses) then you can safely ignore everything they say as it'll be incredibly cherry-picked & best case scenario."
2021-04-15 14:05:23,wallstreetbets,They all should say ‚Äúmot financial advice‚Äù. It‚Äôs illegal to tell a group of people to invest in X at a certain time. This is also why most say they eat crayons. It‚Äôs your choice weather you believe someone who eats crayons
2021-04-15 19:56:31,wallstreetbets,"Responsible for 80% of my options losses and I'm considering buying more.  I'm addicted to disappointment, apparently."
2021-04-15 15:24:35,wallstreetbets,Why not both?
2021-04-15 14:56:17,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs the FOMO DD. The correct one was 1 week prior when it was 23-24
2021-04-15 13:30:25,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I've got 100 @ 31.74 too which I'll keep, still expecting it to rise in the future"
2021-04-15 14:54:46,wallstreetbets,Which DD did you follow? The first one i saw on WSB was when it was 23-24 then 1-2 weeks later it jumped to 35. I‚Äôm not sure what else you want unless you‚Äôre talking about the FOMO DD of when it was 30+ already
2021-04-15 18:00:21,wallstreetbets,Yeah gme and amc are hella sus. Guarantee the massive amount of hype that continues to surround them is supported by funds that ride the price action and use diamond hands as bagholders when they take profit
2021-04-15 14:29:19,wallstreetbets,Told ya!!
2021-04-15 12:55:50,wallstreetbets,Bold of you to assume I'm allowed to show up on time

2021-04-15 14:30:21,wallstreetbets,Anit that the truth. Usually I trust DD if the stock hasn't spiked yet.
2021-04-15 17:05:22,wallstreetbets,"Speak for yourself

2021-04-15 16:26:50,wallstreetbets,"I think you're talking about my post!!

I never suggested the 4/16 $35c's, I just posted that I had one of those contracts.

If people would have looked closely at the positions posted at the end of the post, they would've noticed that 94% of my initial funds put towards ASO were in 5/21 $30c's lol"

2021-04-15 16:49:08,wallstreetbets,"This was my lesson when buying options. My first option I bought was the rocket spike. I bought it the day before, next day watched it spike, then sold near the peak and felt like a genius. My second options play was on a Ford 13 dollar call. I made over 50% the next day and didnt sell because I had 3 weeks left to expire. Of course, it went red the next day and ended up expiring worthless. Setting a profit target and getting out fast is the way."
2021-04-15 19:37:01,wallstreetbets,I thought I was allowed to make 4 day trades per week and didn't realize the 4th was the one that got you restricted for 90 days ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I've had options in the green on day 1 and wanted to sell but can't lmao

Consolidated once I hit 30k play money and I'm good to go."
2021-04-15 13:57:23,wallstreetbets,What happens when you think DD means A) a guarantee or B) Dungeons & Dragons

2021-04-15 15:01:21,wallstreetbets,"If you think ""no reason"" is why a moderately-shorted sports retailer whose only real news since the pandemic started was a cyclical COVID sales report and a 300% stock increase...didn't see significant movement this week, I've got a hell of a lot of naked calls to sell you.

Shorted ASO as soon as people started pumping it here."

ASO is a strong buy long term and the stock has high short interest (if we want to believe SI data these days) with a ratio of 7:1. Do we think the shorts covered in the last couple of weeks since the short interest reporting date?

Then you're going to pay ordinary income taxes on these capital gains, as they are short-term. The IRA withdrawal increases your tax rate.

You can pay back your distribution (hopefully with your gains!) within 60 calendar days (""indirect rollover"") and there is no tax effect on that. It will also reduce the rate you pay on your capital gains.

2021-04-15 18:33:44,wallstreetbets,their clearing house upped the cash requirement for trades. since RH defaults user accounts to margin they didn't have the cash. it was easier to collude with market manipulators and fuck their users and reputation than to find a fresh source of cash and risk losing their PFOF revenue

2021-04-15 17:27:09,wallstreetbets,"Lol no that's not what happened se√±or shortbus.

They restricted selling it so when it hit $400 no one could hit sell or buy. Then when the price had dropped to $200 you could sell it but not buy it.

So they didn't let you make money at $400 a share, but they would buy your shares at $200. Thing was, since no one could hit buy, everyone knew there was a shady entity actually buying the shares for the new artificially deflated price 50% less than opening bell.

That's what happened. That's why this op is such an idiot. He won't be able to make money when it does squeeze. RH won't let him sell until it stops. He could easily just sell all his shares and use the money (2 day transfer to your bank account) to then buy the shares on a new platform but this is fake anyways so whatever."

Other folks have posted about limitations on limit sales with at least Charles Schwab and TD ameritrade that I've seen.

2021-04-15 11:59:41,wallstreetbets,"> We would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing. But logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares.   
>  
>...  
the biggest insider purchase was by Chairman James Mullen for US$1.2m worth of shares, at about US$46.27 per share. That means that even when the share price was higher than US$41.53 (the recent price), an insider wanted to purchase shares. It's very possible they regret the purchase, but it's more likely they are bullish about the company.

Definitely bullish. You have people like Musk saying that TSLA is too expensive, whereas this guy and his peers are loading up on more. Potentially they know some good news is coming soon."

2021-04-15 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$MDU - Strong Financials, Consistent Growth, Solid Dividend - Why MDU Resources is a Buy I wanted to find a stable company to add to my portfolio. One with strong fundamentals, a decent dividend and solid growth potential. I came across MDU Resources, headquartered in North Dakota and operates as a diversified utility, pipeline, construction services company.

MDU Resources has continued to execute well amidst a challenging economy. It recently achieved near record-breaking results and has strategic investments planned for this year. I have highlighted some of the key points on my analysis below

Company

Construction and utility provider MDU Resources (MDU) had a tough 2020. Construction projects were halted or delayed in a lot of cases, and utility stocks weren‚Äôt exactly in favor with investors during a period when growth stocks reigned supreme. Still, for long-term investors with an eye on value and yield, I think MDU is a great choice.

MDU Resources Group, Inc.‚Äôs MDU two-platform business model, strategic acquisitions, capital investments in the electric and natural gas utility plus improving backlog are its key tailwinds. Also, the company boasts enough liquidity to meet its near-term obligations.

Some key highlights on why I think it might be a good pick up for your portfolio

**Consistent long-term growth at 9.3% EBITDA CAGR and 16.7% EPS CAGR**

* Stocks with higher earnings-per-share growth rates are generally more desired by investors than those with slower earnings-per-share growth rates. This is a good sign for MDU and has a decent shot at beating earnings upcoming in early May
* Balance of cyclical and counter cyclical business with almost a 50/50 split between construction and regulated energy. this bodes well for the long run and will likely be a stable performer in the market

**Runway of attractive organic and inorganic growth opportunities**

* Organic Growth: We are all familiar with the infrastructure spending bill that was passed in the UIS and MDU stand to benefit from this.
* Inorganic Growth: **MDU Resources (MDU) Arm Buys Mt. Hood Rock, Expands in Portland (**[**here**](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mdu-resources-mdu-arm-buys-163304894.html)**)** These investments will be aimed at enhancing the reliability of the company‚Äôs services, thus enabling it to serve an increasing customer base, effectively. MDU Resources anticipates its electric and natural gas utility segment to see a CAGR of 5% and expects its customer base to expand 1-2%, annually.

**Improving ROIC driven by rigorous capital allocation process**

* Return on invested capital (ROIC) is a calculation used to assess a company's efficiency at allocating the capital under its control to profitable investments. The return on invested capital ratio gives a sense of how well a company is using its capital to generate profits.
* A company is thought to be creating value if its ROIC exceeds 2% and destroying value if it is less than 2%. MDU Resources Group's ROIC % is 6.29% (calculated using TTM income statement data).
* MDU Resources Group generates higher returns on investment than it costs the company to raise the capital needed for that investment. It is earning excess returns. A firm that expects to continue generating positive excess returns on new investments in the future will see its value increase as growth increases.

**Valuation**

I find MDU to be attractively priced at $31.29, with a blended PE of 15.9. This sits below MDU's historical PE of 19.4 over the past decade,

Analysts also express a bullish view on the stock, with a consensus Buy rating and an average price target of $34.33, implying a 10% upside potential from the current share price.

**Earnings**

Earnings are forecast to grow 6.74% per year and Earnings grew by 16.6% over the past year. If this trend continues, we will likely see a rise in the share price

**Insider Trading**

Significant insider buying over the last year with a majority of shares purchased in May 2020. This would make sense considering the price dropped off a cliff just a month prior. The management team knew it was a bargain and acted on the low share price

https://preview.redd.it/mm0ufvp1zct61.png?width=1409&format=png&auto=webp&s=9a48dd33dfa8bc4e1266ce88b085e687234e36f4

# Risks

**Biden‚Äôs Infrastructure Plan** \- While I see potential tailwinds for MDU's construction business from Biden's proposed infrastructure plan, there's no guarantee that such a proposal will pass. The construction business is more cyclical than the regulated utility business, and adds complexity risk to MDU's business model.

**Mild Dilution** \- MDU relies on both equity and debt to fund capital projects. This includes $100M in expected equity issuances this year, which will be mildly dilutive to shareholders

# TLDR

I'm encouraged by the impressive earnings it generated amidst a challenging economy. Based o some of the key factors and management guidance I see continued growth for MDU for the foreseeable future. I continue to find the valuation to be attractive and the dividend to be well-covered and safe. Consider looking at MDU and potentially adding it to your portfolio.

2021-04-15 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"AMC Discussion Recently, I've diversified my portfolio and put it all in AMC. Personally, I think AMC has a ton of potential for several reasons:

1. 99% of AMC theaters are now open, and the pandemic has eliminated many of their competitors. Plus, there is a international surge in movie crowds as the pandemic seems to be slowing down
2. AMC is a great momentum stock almost certain to climb higher. It has gained 96.33% this past quarter while the S&P have only moved up 2.3% respectively.
3. AMC has a zacks rank 2# (buy) ranking, basically saying that its positive earning outlook could easily translate to buying pressure which in turn would push the stock up.

Alright, these are my reasons, and whether you agree or not, thanks for reading and please comment on your thoughts.

P.S This not necessarily financial advice, nor am i a financial expert, this is just my humble opinion of the stock.

Edit: So a lot of people have been talking about the pandemic and how watching movies at home is the thing now, so I just to point out 3 things:

1. AMC at some point may shift their marketing strategy so we should dismiss it's growth off the the way it is operating now.
2. Also, watching movies at home is not the same as at a theater, the screen is not as bigger  and the experience as a whole is different. (Think imax and 3d stuff). Plus, people have been binge watching netflix the whole pandemic, by now they are probably ready for a change. 
3. Lastly, when it comes to the pandemic, people are getting vaccinated and they are getting more used to social distancing and masks. The point is not that people will cram back into theaters. They will come back with safety measures (social distancing, masks, etc ) and more importantly, they will feel safe and comfortable with this new normal. (unlike at the start where is was just total confusion.)"
2021-04-15 10:40:27,wallstreetbets,You diversified? üëÄ

2021-04-15 12:25:56,wallstreetbets,"Be happy if AMC hits $20.  The model has changed permanently due to this pandemic.  People will start to go back to the theatres, but now they have a permanent competitor in the streaming field.

Warner Bros will no longer exclusively launch in Theatres, nor will Disney.  Paramount will also move to that model with their own Peacock service.  That leaves Universal and some smaller companies.

The only way that AMC can survive in my opinion is to move away from being a movie centric operation to an Entertainment centric operation.  That means that people visit an AMC center to be entertained, not just to watch a movie.  

Merge with Dave and Busters, Open Bowling Alleys, restaurants, etc.  Especially in smaller markets where entertainment choices are limited.

I actually brought this up with the CMO of AMC when I was looking to partner with them.  He gave me this incredulous look as if to say, theatres will never go away.

He's still there, but I'm sure he is not feeling good nowadays."

2021-04-15 15:36:50,wallstreetbets,AMC is speaking out regarding voter rights or something. Could be a bad idea. Wouldn‚Äôt be the first to ‚Äúget woke and go broke‚Äù company.

2021-04-15 12:01:45,wallstreetbets,"I don't understand why. Cinemark was in the ~$25 range before the pandemic so why was AMC, which is arguably larger and better equipped for the future with their subscription plan, so undervalued?"
2021-04-15 12:30:25,wallstreetbets,You could stream movies on your phone or rent from blockbuster. What happened to that? Film experience couldn‚Äôt save Kodak.
2021-04-15 16:24:39,wallstreetbets,Except AMC was on its way to bankruptcy pre covid. Delusional.
2021-04-15 12:31:28,wallstreetbets," ""You can eat at home but you still go to restaurants."" 

That's because the food that most people make at home is mostly crap.  The restaurant industry was decimated by fast casual industry that DOES not provide an experience.  

This is not a real comparison anyway.  Currently the home gourmet industry like Hello Fresh is killing the restaurant industry.  The only ones that will do well will be upscale ones or ones with a theme that is not focused on food (like a resto-lounge, gastro-pub and places with amazing patios).  The traditional places are hurting bad."

2021-04-15 10:45:25,wallstreetbets,"Gonna have to agree, Semi; also I thought a large part of that spike in movie sales is at home, not theatres(?). I understand that people are going stir crazy, but I think alot of people will be wary of cramming back into a theatre, especially if an outbreak is eventually linked to one of those brick n mortar theatres."

2. their bonuses were actually mostly stocks and they have to hold stocks being executives
3. that‚Äòs why AMC is 5% up and GME 5% down today?
4. higher short interest than GME on the one hand (short term squeeze play) and the biggest cinema company in the world with 5billon $ revenue pre pandamic while vaccinations rise on the other hand (long term play)."
2021-04-15 12:38:04,wallstreetbets,I feel like that might be true initially as I personally experienced this nervousness already but I‚Äôm starting to venture out more and more... not saying amc should be a 100% investment but I definitely don‚Äôt think they will be going anywhere anytime soon

2021-04-15 15:38:53,wallstreetbets,Before the pandemic AMC was literally $10 a share. And that was back when they had 100 million outstanding shares. But what do I know? Must be the crayons I'm eating.
2021-04-15 12:09:10,wallstreetbets,Share price is irrelevant. AMC was worth double the value of Cinemark by market cap pre-pandemic.
2021-04-15 12:18:21,wallstreetbets,"That is the dumbest comment I read today.  If you were to say  ""AMC was at $35 at the end of 2016, so why can't it get back to that price?""  that would make more sense."
2021-04-15 12:18:48,wallstreetbets,"Just a wild guess, but AMC has been bleeding money since at least 2018, probably longer. CNK has only been bleeding money since the pandemic. CNK has 118 million shares while AMC has 450 million. CNK appears to be better managed."
2021-04-15 18:13:39,wallstreetbets,Wait are you doing a straight pps comparison instead of market cap?
2021-04-15 17:22:43,wallstreetbets,"People have been calling on death for cinema ever since home video came around. It‚Äôs still there. It‚Äôs absolutely not going anywhere any time soon box office gross is too great. You‚Äôd never get the blockbusters we see today without them either. 

I still think AMC is a risk in a sense the debt is insane and they have been vastly mismanaged the same as Cineworld and both are still in trouble to an extent.

But I‚Äôve some shares for the squeeze we may see. End of the day that‚Äôs what we are all here for.

Also seeing comments further down about the theatrical exclusivity window clearly don‚Äôt follow the industry or have knowledge because many have already come out and stated this isn‚Äôt the case."

2021-04-15 15:55:46,wallstreetbets,"I'm in Australia, and I know that in many ways Aussie's and American's are quite different, but they're also more similar than they are different, culturally, in my opinion. 

I just say that for reference, because there are only a handful of COVID cases in the entire country, and movies have re-opened, but last I heard they're struggling to get customers.   
At least relative to what it was pre-COVID.   
People here (I can't speak for all of Aus though, just my region I guess) have even become more cautious toward any kind of sickness in general.   
Maybe I'm too pessimistic... I hope it all eventually course corrects to what it was, but I think this whole pandemic has set so many societies onto entirely new courses, and certain industries will be forced to change to survive - such as cinemas. 

What that change could be, I can't tell you. 

Weirdly, I drove by a concert the other day and the young'uns were packed in like sardines.  
But that same demographic avoid groups like the plague in regular day to day.   
Hmm maybe those kinds of contradictions will prove that things will go back sooner rather than later.

They see this big swing coming first in April with the A sample. Then either a partnership or a buyout should shoot it up to well over $25. Some guess over $100. Time will tell.

2021-04-15 17:31:44,wallstreetbets,"ay im new to investing, what app is this?"
2021-04-15 15:04:14,wallstreetbets,"Two things. Their lidar product should be out any day now. Limited quantity. 

Second. They said they are up for sale. 

Either it gets bought out or goes bankrupt. Microsoft rumored interested but with the way they are blowing through their cash. it means share dilution or going under before that could happen. A company wont buy while the stock rises. They will wait for it to tank. Id stay way way far away from this stock. Not financial advice at all.

Please post the massive loss porn later."
2021-04-15 16:44:32,wallstreetbets,Isn‚Äôt this the same company that spends more time and resources into hyping up news and potential catalysts to dress up their stock for buyers than actually having a working business model ?
2021-04-15 15:41:06,wallstreetbets,"How in The actual fukk dear ape, do ya still use robinhood?"
2021-04-15 18:26:03,wallstreetbets,"Bet you sold it at 11.72 after the rollercoaster ride to 10.40. Also, guaranteed this retard made all this money from GME or AMC that's why he would do something this stupid."

2021-04-15 17:27:48,wallstreetbets,Or it's a photoshopped picture lol.
2021-04-15 12:09:17,wallstreetbets,I was drawn in by what appeared to be sound DD regarding this company and it's imminent break-out.  While my thesis technically hasn't changed---should see a spike on release of A-sample results this month---I realize now just how speculative I was and the DD supporting this stock is.  I am very bitter that it has paired back all gains from the news that MSFT landed a big HoloLens contract with US gov.
2021-04-15 16:34:27,wallstreetbets,"> If he dropped 1.1 mil on mvis @ 11 average something is up

2021-04-15 12:16:40,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs either manipulation, or the catalyst got leaked. But if it got leaked, volume would be much higher, so I‚Äôm thinking manipulation especially with the market ripping today.

I guess EVs tanking today also plays a factor"
2021-04-15 12:24:21,wallstreetbets,It's a very shorted stock
2021-04-15 17:13:18,wallstreetbets,Naked shorts I believe. I don‚Äôt know who is selling because everyone says they are buying today!!
2021-04-15 12:41:23,wallstreetbets,"Yep and here I am swimming in an ocean of blood red. Good lord it's been a brutal drop, but seeing how much this fucker got shorted on no news tells me you are right."
2021-04-15 14:16:00,wallstreetbets,"Only 10k left now, this could be a really nice play in the coming day or two. If we survive this initial bloodbath lol."
2021-04-15 17:02:47,wallstreetbets,Good enough for me. I just put 1k$ into it. Fuck a stop loss.
2021-04-15 15:05:09,wallstreetbets,they are up for sale. maybe someone tanking the price to help it get sold.
2021-04-15 16:49:07,wallstreetbets,I am mad at them but I still use it for like 400 MVIS shares til buyout or big money and I will cash out for some spending money and then close my Rh account for good
2021-04-15 10:35:41,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, RH is almost the perfect brokerage, if only it had better charts. Does away with all the bullshit and has streamlined UI. 

Just wish they had a customer service line..."
2021-04-15 18:08:53,wallstreetbets,Fuck it I‚Äôm buying
2021-04-15 12:44:13,wallstreetbets,Their tech is in the Hololens 2. Rumors it might be bought out by MS.
2021-04-15 12:12:42,wallstreetbets,"Im interested in this now - Im new to TA but its near the bollinger band bottom line, which bounced it up a couple times before - does that give a 3rd support?   


Ik Im asking a lot but whats your stop loss and price targets - might as follow 'smart money'"
2021-04-15 16:13:04,wallstreetbets,He said he already pulled out 600k of 1.7mill afte starting with 20k.

2021-04-15 11:29:48,wallstreetbets,Thank you for your service
2021-04-15 16:50:57,wallstreetbets,I am pretty much all in on MVIS. Even thinking about selling my SNDL and AMC to buy more MVIS
2021-04-15 14:46:28,wallstreetbets,Yes himx or mvis. If mvis squeezes so does himx
2021-04-15 13:23:15,wallstreetbets,ü•≤
2021-04-15 17:06:15,wallstreetbets,Hold tight because it can take off at any moment. It might be next week because of options expiring tomorrow - or tomorrow afternoon could go up if people want to get in before a possible merger Monday
2021-04-15 17:24:07,wallstreetbets,Holding and buying more each day! Anytime I have sold MVIS since last April has been a mistake!
2021-04-15 16:36:51,wallstreetbets,Informed folks on R/MVIS put a reasonable target between 5-8B market cap ($33-52/share)
2021-04-15 16:52:01,wallstreetbets,Over a hundred please... change my life and the life of my children (and future grandchildren)

2021-04-15 17:18:26,wallstreetbets,Yes üëç
2021-04-15 17:08:07,wallstreetbets,So glad so many people are buying today! Who the F is selling?
2021-04-15 18:06:10,wallstreetbets,"I must've got in around the same time. I started buying around $1 and everything I kept saying I was done. Then I kept reading the reddit mvis board and pretty much went all in. Now I'm up to 80,000 shares between 2 account. GLAL."
2021-04-15 12:53:12,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm doing the same thing. I use to tell people anything under $2 is free money. I‚Äôm still basically telling people the same thing....
2021-04-15 16:52:31,wallstreetbets,I have been adding each day for two weeks! Thank myself later
2021-04-15 14:04:41,wallstreetbets,"no it‚Äôs not, they‚Äôre not making any money, i‚Äôve had 3 dollar stock, even 0,5 that had more cash flow than this company, you‚Äôre actually overpaying by a lot right now."
2021-04-15 16:34:30,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs not about a squeeze it‚Äôs about a company being bought out for many times it‚Äôs current market cap.
2021-04-15 17:18:04,wallstreetbets,I buy about 10-20 each day when I scrape together new money or sell other positions. Now I have 71k shares!
2021-04-15 19:50:16,wallstreetbets,I thought my 300 shares @ 6k was a lot lol...
2021-04-15 16:00:58,wallstreetbets,The typewriting thing right? Don‚Äôt call it a comeback.

2021-04-15 17:07:21,wallstreetbets,He is right on this one! It‚Äôs going up to $30-80 and maybe even over $100
2021-04-15 17:24:46,wallstreetbets,Yeah that was my goal at one point... but she took off and I only have 71k ü•≤
2021-04-15 17:23:21,wallstreetbets,I bought at 11.61 and then it kept dropping. I will buy more tomorrow when more funds clear
2021-04-15 10:48:37,wallstreetbets,"Why the hell would you sell then? You saw it dip from 18 down to 11 and you‚Äôll bitch out if it dips just a little lower, knowing that it could easily rebound back to around 20 soon? And on top of that the company will likely be bought out as well....you might as well just tough it out of it dips lower instead of throwing your cash into a bonfire for no reason other than you peed your pants a little."
2021-04-15 17:15:11,wallstreetbets,I hope you can ride out tomorrow because tomorrow could be tough due to options expiring. It moved up to $18 or 19 when the Microsoft army contract was announced two weeks ago. We are waiting for their automotive Lidar update! They have solid state Lidar and it‚Äôs small and best of class! I believe it‚Äôs the key to self driving cars!
2021-04-15 10:52:18,wallstreetbets,MVIS seems like a fucking garbage stock.
2021-04-15 16:57:09,wallstreetbets,"If you're this unsure where it will go, why don't you sell 4-500 covered call around 18-19 strike price? You would get around $100 per option, and if it moons much higher on buyout news or something, you still have plenty of shares that won't be called away."
2021-04-15 17:18:18,wallstreetbets,Hero
2021-04-15 17:21:00,wallstreetbets,We need more like this guy

2021-04-15 19:50:01,wallstreetbets,"They haven‚Äôt been doing any ‚Äúhyping‚Äù they have been very discreet lately, not much PR and people are speculating because they have a buy out negotiation pending."

edit: their"
2021-04-15 17:10:28,wallstreetbets,I think it could be split up between Microsoft and Google! Google owns Waymo and Google has partnered with Ford. MVIS just added a few more people with ties to Ford and Google to their board of directors. Seval Oz has ties to Google. She didn‚Äôt receive stock options like everyone else. Is she facilitating the buyout??? Is she working for Google? Time will tell!
2021-04-15 13:20:55,wallstreetbets,"I am anything but smart money. Don‚Äôt have a stop loss, and I‚Äôm looking for a buyout catalyst. If you scroll through the comments I posted the short interest - 2 days ago 1.6 million shares were available to short, and that dropped down to just 25k shares available today. It‚Äôs either insider trading and this is a bust, or this is being heavily manipulated for big money to get in ahead of a spike"
2021-04-15 16:42:23,wallstreetbets,I think I would've reversed it and only left 600k in.

For those that don't know, there are multiple verticals at play here all in emerging markets. Lidar, AR/VR etc. Head over to r/MVIS and check out the DD - it's all stickied and easy to find/read. There's too many dots for me to type up but they are all pointing to something big."
2021-04-15 17:02:21,wallstreetbets,"I would like that too, but I think $30 to $60 would be more realistic and possible."
2021-04-15 17:57:13,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-04-15 17:03:36,wallstreetbets,I am buying like it‚Äôs still under two! Same mentality
2021-04-15 16:48:06,wallstreetbets,Both can happen at once

2021-04-15 11:58:09,wallstreetbets,"you convinced me, in for 200 shares"
2021-04-15 10:58:42,wallstreetbets,MVIS is a powerhouse stock.
2021-04-15 16:17:53,wallstreetbets,I don‚Äôt understand how there‚Äôs such a (relatively) large amount of people in this sub who have million $ to just throw at this thing for some karma lmao
2021-04-15 17:28:01,wallstreetbets,"Congratulations, you made it"
2021-04-15 15:20:03,wallstreetbets,CEO recently said they have a $78 mil cash position and they are burning over $5 mil a quarter and that cost is rising. That fine for a while just got shorter.
2021-04-15 17:33:09,wallstreetbets,And spend 5-5.5 mil a quarter with no sales. And costs rising.
2021-04-15 19:28:10,wallstreetbets,"If the technology was that amazing then why not use it for themselves... MVIS exists to dress themselves up as a buyout for a fancy suitor, and isn‚Äôt gonna make money anytime soon but hey that‚Äôs just my humble opinion, good luck to ya"
2021-04-15 19:59:22,wallstreetbets,"Having a buyout pending negotiations sounds like the opposite of discreet no PR. I honestly hate being the only bear in the room and I don‚Äôt mean to crap on anyone‚Äôs investments so I‚Äôll leave it alone from here but I just think this is an obvious trap looking for a cash grab because there‚Äôs no $ being made with the business. Didn‚Äôt it already run from $2 to $22 and now back down to 12? I guess I can understand people looking for that volatility . And hey this guy just dropped a milli on it and I‚Äôm eating pb and j sandwiches with my wife‚Äôs boyfriend over here so by all means he‚Äôs probably much smarter than me lol . Honestly, wish y‚Äôall the best. I‚Äôll be losing all my money in GameStop while y‚Äôall will be partying with your fancy micro vision laser pointers in Palo Alto"
2021-04-15 17:24:07,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-04-15 12:52:25,wallstreetbets,Lol I'd say a cool million on any position looking like MVIS does right now is a yolo.
2021-04-15 17:12:43,wallstreetbets,"Yeah that stuff sounds a bit conspiratorial for my taste, but I admit I am ignorant about what can / does go on. I am certain many people will do unscrupulous things to make money, so if there is price manipulation it definitely wouldn't shatter my belief that humans are greedy little shits."
2021-04-15 19:27:21,wallstreetbets,That would come as a very big surprise to everyone who is hyping MVIS atm. Evidence or diaf.
2021-04-15 17:24:32,wallstreetbets,Doubt but still hopeful...
2021-04-15 17:16:27,wallstreetbets,Who tf said hedge funds won‚Äôt be making money going long here? One hedge wins and the other loses
2021-04-15 16:50:24,wallstreetbets,MVIS moves up quickly when she moves üöÄ
2021-04-15 16:06:36,wallstreetbets,"Not if a nice catalyst occurs. Such as a buyout or a great product release. The play isn't the squeeze, that is only just now starting to look like that. Most are in for the potential buyout and many just appreciate the tech offered by the company."
2021-04-15 17:29:37,wallstreetbets,You miss the last couple times MVIS dropped this much?
2021-04-15 15:26:03,wallstreetbets,I managed to buy at 17.07 and then again at $18. Yaaahh...
2021-04-15 13:00:51,wallstreetbets,"Here‚Äôs what happened in layman‚Äôs terms: 

Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre the middleman for a weed deal. You buy weed from a wholesaler, and sell the weed to Chad who doesn‚Äôt know anyone in the weed game or is too scared to deal with a cartel lackey, for a small commission/fee. You make money off the commissions and the returns from the investments you made with commissions, and buy more weed to sell to more Chads. You have a pretty steady business supplying 1000 Chads with weed. What happens if 10000000 Chads suddenly try to buy weed through you? You won‚Äôt have enough money to buy from the wholesaler to supply the sudden increase in demand, which is basically what happened with all the brokers back in January.

2021-04-15 17:12:49,wallstreetbets,I have like 90-95% of my portfolio in MVIS (forgive me for this estimation I don‚Äôt want to do the math) my husband is in it. My kids each have some shares... my parents and my siblings! We have all been in for at least 4 months and some almost a year. Holding for big life changing money! I am glad the word is getting out! Especially glad it‚Äôs getting out when it‚Äôs low so people can get in now!!

2021-04-15 12:40:22,wallstreetbets,I learned in school that MVIS is the powerhouse of the cell.
2021-04-15 11:03:02,wallstreetbets,Maybe if you bought in at 2 dollars. It dropped 36% the last 2 weeks.

2021-04-15 18:23:11,wallstreetbets,Hoping to be wow‚Äôd again soon! MVIS shot up more than I had expected! So I keep buying on the dips
2021-04-15 15:30:13,wallstreetbets,The irony of the squoze was they squeezed the wrong target first. Robinhood's still a shit company for not have having enough money in the bank to risk manage a rainy day.
2021-04-15 16:03:46,wallstreetbets,"This is surprisingly accurate.  And I say ""surprisingly"" because of the sub it's on.  Of course it gets downvoted because the sub has been overrun by tinfoil hat conspiracy theorists.

The key point that a lot of people don't get is that even though you pay up front for your shares, the broker can't touch that money until the trade settles 2 days later.  They have to use their money to pay for the shares.  Not the full amount, but the collateral.

I don't understand the purpose of this rule.  I don't know any other industry where someone who is brokering a deal has to use their own money as collateral.  That money would usually come from the buyer."
2021-04-15 18:45:14,wallstreetbets,"If it was just a one day like all other brokerages experienced then maybe a little more leeway would be given.

However, in the days to follow they continue to limit purchase orders to 5 or 10 stocks a day and even still adjusted that rule midday when things start getting spicy again."
2021-04-15 12:20:22,wallstreetbets,"idk about the above poster but in February my GME rocket was heading to the moon and then they stopped everything and only allowed people to sell. Paper hands got terrified and our rocket returned to earth in hours.

RH may not be the only one but it was definitely one of them, the one most of us were using. I'm not falling for that shit again. Fidelity didn't pull that nonsense, so that's where I'm at now and don't plan on going anywhere anytime soon."
2021-04-15 12:40:35,wallstreetbets,"Did I say it was? No.

They still did it though."
2021-04-15 11:11:06,wallstreetbets,Have you tried Koyfin? Tons of features in their free version and a super customizable web interface that's actually really easy to get set up.
2021-04-15 16:15:04,wallstreetbets,"They got liquidation issue and vlad openly lied about it. Fidelity, vanguard and very few didn't had that issue hence allowed trading to buy and sell."
2021-04-15 17:12:29,wallstreetbets,"They didn‚Äôt disable trading.  They disabled BUYING.  

If they had liquidity problems of that size, they should have been forced to liquidate on the spot and all portfolios transferred immediately to a legitimate broker. 

Instead they chose an action which only effected one side of the supply and demand. 

It was fucking criminal whatever their reasoning was. They shouldn‚Äôt exist anymore after that."
2021-04-15 12:43:45,wallstreetbets,Did I sell them to you üëÄ
2021-04-15 17:15:10,wallstreetbets,With the recent 8K showing SS compensation is agreed upon for the next 3 yrs AND including a 'transfer of ownership' clause I feel we are within 60 - 90 days. These agreements are usually done only when the terms of the sale out been outlined and before the definitive agreement is presented.
2021-04-15 17:11:53,wallstreetbets,nicest thing i've been told all day!
2021-04-15 18:38:43,wallstreetbets,This can trigger a squeeze. Imagine a PR drops and massive buy orders Start to get in before the buyout. Would be unfortunate if you had a short position then‚Ä¶

2021-04-15 11:19:03,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs been bouncing around the 12-19 range for months. Lots of big catalysts coming up and possibility of acquisition grows everyday. This isn‚Äôt a meme stock.

2021-04-15 17:31:58,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-04-15 18:45:23,wallstreetbets,So I get there's acquisition talks but why are people bringing up a squeeze too? Or is everything now a squeeze to us retards?
2021-04-15 18:26:30,wallstreetbets,"It gets downvoted because it's not accurate and it's a very unpopular opinion.

Robinhood didn't shut down completely, they just shut down buying GME/AMC and a few other select stocks. They continued to allow millions of other transactions across the board.

You are surprisingly misinformed."
2021-04-15 12:58:32,wallstreetbets,So did you miss out on the huge GME ship? How much money did you miss out on? I'd be pissed.

2021-04-15 17:41:51,wallstreetbets,3y old account that exclusively posts garbage unrelateable posts and memes to ‚Äúr/me_irl‚Äù. No one cares about your opinion. Stay broke
2021-04-15 18:53:24,wallstreetbets,"They shut down buying of the stocks that had the increased collateral requirements.  Then they raised more capital and they removed those restrictions.  Why would they shut down completely?

It's not an unpopular opinion, it's an unpopular fact.  That doesn't make it less true though.  All the tinfoil hat conspiracy theory retardation in the world won't change that.  All the downvotes in the world won't change it either, because truth is not decided by votes.

The fact that this place has become an echo chamber for conspiracy theorists doesn't make the conspiracy theories true.  It just makes you all a laughing stock among people who actually know how all this works. 

You are the QAnon of trading."
2021-04-15 13:11:53,wallstreetbets,"I mean I wasn't going to retire off it but I had 10 shares that were worth over $3k and it dropped to under 1k worth in like 3 hours, was pretty scary but I didn't lose any money on it either."
2021-04-15 14:05:48,wallstreetbets,And yet only a few had to shut down trading. In a volatile market I'll continue to use a broker that is able to execute my trades.
2021-04-15 14:06:25,wallstreetbets,"If a load of Chads turned up, I'd ask for cash upfront."
2021-04-15 17:10:07,wallstreetbets,"Are you seriously trying to defend robinhood?  If they had liquidity problems (which they apparently still say they didn‚Äôt) why did they shut off only buying of certain stocks? 
If you fucked up and don‚Äôt have the money to run your business, you shut your business down.  All of it.  You don‚Äôt get to selectively choose which securities to hinder. 

I hope they get everything that should be coming to them."
2021-04-15 17:28:18,wallstreetbets,I started selling puts instead of averaging down because this fire sale never ends
2021-04-15 13:01:05,wallstreetbets,"What did you start with, and how did you get to 1.7m? GME?"

2021-04-15 14:32:22,wallstreetbets,What if you're not allowed to ask for cash upfront...which is what happened
2021-04-15 18:24:59,wallstreetbets,"This is the point OP is failing to realize. They didn't shut down all business, just selective stocks. That's manipulation and that's fraudulent business practices. I moved to TD Ameritrade and Webull never looked back."

Posts on r/WallStreetBets are \*highly moderated\* compared to other subreddits. We remove a tremendous amount of content every day.

Here's why:

* A submission should have been a comment in the daily thread (""Commentposting"")
   * **Text Submissions**: If your text isn't particularly useful, funny, long, or unique then it should have been a comment in the daily thread and not a submission. Submissions must add something new to the conversation.
   * **Image Submissions:** If your image isn't related to the markets and unique, then it probably doesn't belong on WSB. This includes posts like memes with simple captions, art, non-newsworthy screenshots, etc. If you have to rely on a comment or title, it's probably not a good post.
      * Gain / Loss  / YOLO Screenshots are the exception, and the minimum requirement here is a $2.5K change in value in options or $10K change in value in shares. YOLOs must be above $10K in options, or $25K in shares. Posts **must** include screenshot of positions, and comments **must** include rationale for why you made these particular trades.
* A submission contains misinformation
   * While we can't catch everything, posts that contain false or misleading information will be removed and the users banned. You're encouraged to demand the author for ""proof or ban"". If they can't prove a claim, tag a mod and the author will get banned.

2021-04-15 10:12:57,wallstreetbets,"Time to move on from this sub. If clickbait articles are going to trigger mods to the point where it affects what we are allowed to discuss, that's not a healthy subreddit. Mods are now acting as representatives for the community, despite u/zjz having taken a stance against that.

The community spoke and was happy to have discussion kept to a single daily thread. Then, mods got triggered. Such a shame to see mods fall apart, after the previous drama especially.

Enjoy the tendies. Hopefully u/bawse1 gets removed. He seems pretty sub par. Very typical forum moderator."
2021-04-15 09:49:02,wallstreetbets,"Good. There‚Äôs subs for this. The massive loss (or gain) porn would have came with a swiftness but it‚Äôs a good decision. Scammers would start spamming as well

We're just a bunch of normal people trying to discuss stocks and (banned things) that we like and some nerds with a little bit of power for the first time in their lives wanna go on a power trip. And changing rules based on articles written by Bloomberg? Yikes.
2021-04-15 12:04:47,wallstreetbets,Congrats! Your paperhands are now the laughing stock of every crypto sub I visited this morning. ü§£
2021-04-15 12:20:12,wallstreetbets,I think we should not let the media change our minds and support for crypto. To the MOD if you make choices based on an article from Bloomberg is like you let your self being influenced by an stupid article. I think we should vote and let other mods Vite and ask the older‚Äôs members to Vote and decide. I join here and I am super new to investment and I can say I am super retard but I enjoy reading good DD from other users.

2021-04-15 11:30:00,wallstreetbets,I think everyone is missing the point and are rude af about it. They literally don't want to consistently ban crypto spam. Idk if you ever remembered a few months ago literally every other thread was imaginary coin related.  They may as well ban the hell out of that while they can. You can't buy FD's on imaginary coins
2021-04-15 17:17:48,wallstreetbets,"That fucking idiot doesn‚Äôt know what he‚Äôs talking about so of course MSM finance is gonna hire him

2021-04-15 12:03:45,wallstreetbets,True conviction in a position in true WSB fashion.
2021-04-15 10:09:56,wallstreetbets,Right? This ban shows how much importance WSB puts on media's opinion. Sad.
2021-04-15 10:08:40,wallstreetbets,"Well that's what Bloomberg wants, to make the news. Emily Chang, for example, is trying to instigate shit constantly in her ""interviews""

CEO: we want the best candidates for the job.

Chang: did you hear that? He doesn't want women or minorities. How can someone take that stance today? This is a very bad look for the company.

Ugh"
2021-04-15 17:30:37,wallstreetbets,Certainly just set a fine new precedent.
2021-04-15 19:01:06,wallstreetbets,no it wasn't it was a perfect WSB response.

2021-04-15 09:36:32,wallstreetbets,Does saying crypto still get your comment deleted?
2021-04-15 14:08:17,wallstreetbets,"Exactly, this is only causing confusion and makes the sub look like bitches for letting ONE article control our rules.  Now when it's inevitably reversed *again* it will only compound the confusion.  What a shitshow."
2021-04-15 12:18:55,wallstreetbets,"Coinbase went public yesterday, yet somehow we aren't allowed to talk about their products. I'm half tempted to copy/paste some good DD on them from else where and post it here. Can't talk about COIN without talking about crytop"

2021-04-15 10:31:45,wallstreetbets,"Comes off kinda butthurt honestly

Yeah the Bloomberg article is moronic but this is an overreaction (assuming it‚Äôs not a meme)"
2021-04-15 11:10:41,wallstreetbets,"Meanwhile ETH is skyrocketing for the rest of this year, and we can't post a single rocket emoji here about it, let alone a full DD of rocket emojis."
2021-04-15 17:03:22,wallstreetbets,"yeah there are other ways to handle this. much better ways.

mods take the L here. shitposted by bloomberg and they change the sub rules lol."
2021-04-15 11:27:49,wallstreetbets,Unfortunately I don't think the mods are the brightest
2021-04-15 12:26:42,wallstreetbets,because it‚Äôs funny
2021-04-15 13:02:16,wallstreetbets,"take a look at 4chan /biz/ if you wanna see where ""allowing crypto discussion"" will take us...."
2021-04-15 16:20:46,wallstreetbets,"Yes it's a joke.

Yes, they're seriously stopping the trial of the new crypto rules, but no it's not because of a Bloomberg article lmao."
2021-04-15 09:23:22,wallstreetbets,this is how you get ants
2021-04-15 09:31:48,wallstreetbets,"I mean, it's exactly what you'd expect from someone on WSB.  We're not the brightest, right?"
2021-04-15 09:26:18,wallstreetbets,Not trying to be edgy but wouldn‚Äôt the reverse logic be just as true sounding?
2021-04-15 15:32:28,wallstreetbets,I mean it was already banned for a long time on this sub so had anything actually changed?
2021-04-15 09:49:55,wallstreetbets,"Personally I don't really see the point of them unless they are related to crypto company stocks. Wouldn't want my retarded bets to get actually mixed up with good ones. Lol

Short of crypto being put on wall street, I don't really think it fits the theme as this is subreddit is about stocks. There are crypto subreddits that are good and would enjoy the traffic and discussion."
2021-04-15 10:24:22,wallstreetbets,Yup. We can talk about fucking gourd futures but not Bitcoin?

2021-04-15 09:25:53,wallstreetbets,Incredibly cringe. It signals that WSB mods actually bow to the opinions of the media.

2021-04-15 09:29:51,wallstreetbets,Yea but seeing how media twist words. Next day you will see WSB bows to media.

2021-04-15 09:29:35,wallstreetbets,"You are totally correct, a subreddit named **Wallstreetbets** should allow things such as crypto, forex, realtors, reselling furniture, etc.

Hey, who wants to sign up for Vinovest with me?"
2021-04-15 09:19:59,wallstreetbets,Imagine allowing people to believe you bow to crypto.  Fuck outta here.

2021-04-15 11:11:24,wallstreetbets,Yeah who gives a shit about the article. 90% would‚Äôve been unaware if it wasn‚Äôt for this thread and the rollback by the mods. Really amateur stuff
2021-04-15 17:18:23,wallstreetbets,Indeed
2021-04-15 09:40:37,wallstreetbets,"Until GME blows over there will be a lot of eyes on this sub. Institutions are going to do whatever they can to invalidate this sub and all the users here. If Crypto discussion is enough to discredit this sub then imo it should stay banned. 

I don‚Äôt like the rule, I think we should be able to talk about crypto here, but dir the time being I understand why the choice was made and agree with it. Hopefully things change in the near future and this sub can worry less about public perception."

2021-04-15 15:31:04,wallstreetbets,They don't. Bloomberg seems to think they've suddenly become important and are relentlessly pushing the lamest narrative.
2021-04-15 11:23:02,wallstreetbets,Yeah I‚Äôm not into crypto at all but this response seems a bit unjust. I thought the fundamental reason to allow was for community discussion? Surely it should only be banned for the same reason. Not because fucking Bloomberg decides to write a scummy article like they always do.
2021-04-15 11:19:41,wallstreetbets,Fuck Crypto

The big coins that could be discussed here all have dedicated subs. True, some individual stocks do as well, but crypto fanatics are just as annoying as GME fanatics (and I say that as someone who made money on GME). I think the biggest difference is that we expect gamestonk frenzy to die down at some point.

I guess my position is that the original ban did make sense, partially lifting it also made sense (and the mods found a cool way to do it). My guess is the mods don't want to be accused of manipulating btc prices. ""WSB is embracing it"" news could change the price."

>Won't you allow it..? Wall street is getting more and more into crypto (institutional adoption).

No, we won't allow it. Just a couple of reasons offhand:

1. It's a slippery slope as for what to include and what to exclude.

2. You don't need to explicitly talk about crypto to discuss stocks that deal with crypto. There was [a good example of a $COIN DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mr1za6/coin_150b_570share_price_target) that barely mentioned crypto at all. 

3. It's *really hard* to have a substantive discussion on crypto because the main talking points have been hashed to death.

4. If you thought GME was cultlike, crypto is infinitely moreso. I never thought a non-crypto community could so unabashedly try to pump and dump something, but I was proven wrong. I don't think anyone wants to go through that again. 

5. Lack of regulation. Unlike stock markets which require all sorts of transparency measures like ownership disclosures, crypto has none of that. Not to say these measures don't fail (Wirecard) but they're significantly better than nothing.

6. It makes our community WAY MORE attractive for bad actors. We barely let anyone's side project in, but imagine if one got past us that also stole people's wallets? It would be a disaster. 

7. Crypto subs have to deal with an absolutely insane amount of highly capable scammers. I don't know if we could keep up.

8. The use of leverage means that anyone could very easily ""fake"" a YOLO post. 

> I thought that was WSB. Not just some community that purposefully handicaps earnings and stifles information.

I'm not sure where this sentiment is coming from. There are plenty of other subs that allow crypto, and it's cool if that's your thing, but WSB isn't the place for it. 

It's arguably better that people go to r/CryptoCurrency or whichever sub best suits them, rather than dividing things even further and diluting the discussion. Not every sub has to include crypto. 

That said, we should really get back to posting the weekly earnings threads.

---

And look, I know this isn't what some of you were hoping for, but we basically have a choice to make, to keep striving to be the best at what we are, or to dilute ourselves and open up to ""normies"".

The last thing we want is to become a hivemind, because *that* is how good discussion dies. We were successful at keeping politics at bay, and it's been a huge part of the reason why WSB is doing well. We need to do the same for crypto because I've seen the discussion that tends to stem out of those communities, and it's almost identical. 

Finally, this is just my personal opinion, not that of the broader mod team, however, this is wide consensus that crypto is not something that will ever have a place on this sub.

Thanks for coming to my ted talk"
2021-04-15 10:02:38,wallstreetbets,There are other subreddits for discussing cc and I like that this sub is focussed on stocks.  But I think we should be able to at least talk about what publicly traded cc companies do as a business model without our comments being flagged.

Bank earnings were this week but it's impossible to discuss anything other than GME/AMC/BB. It's awful. (I know it's not the mods' fault, you guys are doing what you can.)"
2021-04-15 14:00:47,wallstreetbets,Good reasons here. I also just wanted to ask if you knew that subreddit has its own currency attached to karma in the sub called moons. One upvote is worth like .88 moons which is worth like 6 cents per upvote. Thats like $6 for every 100 upvotes up in this bitch. Posts and comments with 1000 upvotes worth $60 each. And a 10k upvote banger from someone like DFV would get you $600. Shit is wild. And I assume will never ever happen here.

If this was enough to sway 1 or 2 guys who were apprehensive but wanted to at least try, then it's enough to change the majority vote.  


The new policy of only some coins in only 1 particular thread as a trial run was an obvious concession to see how it would play out. Here we are 1 day later with an article pointing the change out as if it's indicative of public sentiment shifts. It doesn't help that this mod team has had issues with shills and crypto scams in the past, so of course a good number of them are hesitant to revert to a more lenient rule set. 


Also doesn't help that new WSB is stupid and cult-ish enough to actually get caught pumping an obvious scam and that most coins would be banned anyway for being under the 1b market cap rule."

To be honest, I agree with them. It's already quite difficult communicating very obvious, black and white, rules when there are so many new faces, it would be hard and unfair to make them complicated.

2021-04-15 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"AMC filed with the SEC its promise not to issue any of the 500m shares if authorized in 2021 - but what does this really mean? TLDR at the bottom. 

The CEO of AMC has publicly promised yesterday to submit in writing with the SEC that AMC does not plan to issue any of the 500m shares if authorized by shareholders in May. 

Happy to report that as of this morning AMC filed [Statement 14A](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/e5d2e721-c60b-4f74-9f90-7e970a8fc426.html) reiterating exactly what AA said in the interview: 

 
>**Adam Aron**: We are going to pledge right now today publicly and we will file this publicly so it will be binding on us, because you can‚Äôt announce intentions and then not carry through it, we hereby pledge at AMC that if the shareholders approve this authorization for 500 million new shares to be issued we will not use one of those 500 million shares in calendar year 2021. Not one. Not one.
 
>. . .
 
>**Adam Aron**: If we need to raise some cash in the short term, remember we already have 43 million shares that are out there that were authorized in the year 2013 that we could use if we wish to raise some cash, if we decide that‚Äôs a good idea. We have made no decisions yet. We are thinking about it, but we haven‚Äôt made any decisions yet.

This is a cause for cautious celebration - the CEO stands by his statement, and is serious about keeping the promise. 

But, the emphasis is on cautious. First rule of sound investing - read the fine print. That‚Äôs how they screw you. 


>Should one or more of these risks, trends, uncertainties or facts [listed above] materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those indicated or anticipated by the forward-looking statements contained herein. **Accordingly, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made.** Forward-looking statements should not be read as a guarantee of future performance or results and will not necessarily be accurate indications of the times at, or by, which such performance or results will be achieved.

Let me unpack this for you. **AMC is saying that if any of the bad things they listed in the statement happen  they will not hesitate one moment to issue more shares.**. Theater openings delayed? More shares. AMC can‚Äôt pay its interest and debt on schedule? More shares. Motion pictures companies don‚Äôt want to screen their movies at theaters for months and go to their own digital platform after two weeks? You got it, more shares. 

**STAY DILIGENT AND DO WHATS BEST FOR YOUR WALLET**

Seen many people switch to an automatic ‚Äúyes‚Äù on their vote. I won‚Äôt be one of those people. 

I‚Äôm not an advisor or your advisor, financial or otherwise. I‚Äôm just a guy with thousands of AMC shares who likes to read the fine print and make weighted decisions based on facts. 

Full disclosure - I sold a third of my April 2019 shares in January to recoup basis and take profits. The rest is in for the ride as it‚Äôs all pure profit, so naturally I want it to go as high as possible.

TLDR: good news the CEO stood by his promise. Bad news they can still issue more shares if the situation gets worse this year. My ‚Äúno‚Äù vote stands."
2021-04-15 11:19:05,wallstreetbets,"Best thing for the stock price short term is a no vote, best thing for the stock price long term is a yes vote. Plan accordingly."
2021-04-15 09:06:36,wallstreetbets,No real wrong answer here due to pros and cons to both sides.  People who are here purely for the squeeze and to make a buck vote no.  Anyone else who is truly going to hold past the squeeze longer term should vote yes.
2021-04-15 12:19:20,wallstreetbets,Why dont they issue this vote again in january 2022 if they promise not to sell any this year?

2021-04-15 12:25:02,wallstreetbets,"I agree, plus I find it frustrating for the arguments for yes. Here's why that makes no sense. Adam will not issue any new shares this year (is his promise). Okay so let's vote no for now and yes after the squeeze. What do the yes voters have to lose? Nothing. IF they vote yes? They can dilute and suck out all the squeeze for themselves to pay off debt. Then they'll claim it 'had to happen.' They'll say he loves apes and enough people will forget about it. There is not a single logical reason to vote no for now. We fought for months, helped this movie franchise from being bankrupt, and we wouldlike some tendies."
2021-04-15 11:45:33,wallstreetbets,"He is basically saying, he is going to use the leftover 43m shares to sell for this year and will wait till 2022 to sell any of the new 500m shares."
2021-04-15 17:25:38,wallstreetbets,Yep that's a big no for me. From what I learned in the past is to never trust CEOS

Sure GME may have been the original squeeze but it looks like AMC may üöÄ first now. 

If the GME folks don‚Äôt start supporting the AMC crowd what we‚Äôll see are people going paper hands early, and any loss of steam will simply be an indicator of what they can expect wherever a GME squeeze arrives.

2021-04-15 14:25:49,wallstreetbets,"Watch Treys Trades interview with AMC CEO from last night. Not only is he protecting our short term investment but any longs as well. Plus in the history of AMC releasing new shares, the stock price strategically went up, not a dilution, ever."

2021-04-15 18:03:31,wallstreetbets,"u/JakTravis_u_SOB

There is a sneaky proposal he found with the proxy vote on AMC. His words:

""They have a sneaky proposal. Its says they can adjourn the meeting regarding the 500,000 shares if they don't get enough yes votes and remote on it at a later date so as to get ""more votes"" until it passes. This is proposal 6. The last question"""
2021-04-15 09:46:43,wallstreetbets,just pushed through the sell wall hedgies set up at 9.99 and 10.00
2021-04-15 19:51:39,wallstreetbets,"You think AMC crashed in January solely because Robinhood restrictions? No. They diluted their shares like crazy at the peak to take advantage of us. You, me, and other call and shareholders were backstabbed and you are still buying this junk? Get ready for that 43m shares dumped on you again."
2021-04-15 09:11:51,wallstreetbets,It means that the short sellers only have to depress the price until 2022. I still believe amc had been a distraction from the other stock.
2021-04-15 17:42:16,wallstreetbets,Oh so hes not saying they wont sell any of the shares in 2021; hes just saying that as of now they have no plans to sell any of the shares in 2021. Very diferent statements thanks for posting this to clear it up. I knew it was mostly talk but now it seems even more worthless
2021-04-15 11:45:24,wallstreetbets,"Whenever any public company announces stuff like this IN PUBLIC, it's usually to get the current shareholders to hold on to their shares. So as the short attacks happen, the people who believed this CEO will either hold on, buy more or both. But they won't sell because then the CEO and the BOD will have to declare an early bankruptcy. All I see is a prolongation of bad event for AMC with this news. If there was any power to what the CEO is saying, the stock should be trading at 30% higher than yesterday's close. But short sellers aren't covering, are they? That is your biggest clue."
2021-04-15 13:03:31,wallstreetbets,The company will go out of business if they don‚Äôt sell more shares. So yea. It will help this mythical short squeeze if they don‚Äôt issue. But also a bankrupt company is worth zero.
2021-04-15 16:18:20,wallstreetbets,ceo doesn‚Äôt set the rules the board does.
2021-04-15 16:32:26,wallstreetbets,"Yeah and of course... 2021 is fast running out... So on January 1 2022 they are gonna drop 500 million shares in to the market immediately.

That kinda makes me think that holding AMC any longer than the 31st of December would be retarded."
2021-04-15 14:34:53,wallstreetbets,TLDR: don't keep bending over while AMC unzips
2021-04-15 12:58:43,wallstreetbets,"Even without the 500m, there's still no chance of a squeeze. They've already heavily diluted their shares since the January squeeze, and there's 43 million more that they can deploy at any time even if they don't use the 500m additional they're begging for.

This shit ain't gonna squeeze again, and the sooner people realize that the better off they'll be."
2021-04-15 09:31:45,wallstreetbets,"That's great and all, but they were sitting 300 million shares that have been incrementally released over the last 6 months, as well as all the convertible debt that has been (or will be) converted to class a stock and sold (like Wanda did with 44 Mil shares). The company, their institutional holders, and borrowers know that the price is already inflated, they'll sell off if there's any bit of a ""squeeze""."
2021-04-15 09:46:23,wallstreetbets,it means that amc is a distraction
2021-04-15 14:22:18,wallstreetbets,Facts!
2021-04-15 15:26:28,wallstreetbets,"A no vote almost ensures they have to use the 43 million shares they already have to distribute if you‚Äôre here for the short term the better option is a YES vote because he can hold out a year.

AMC filed with the Sec that none of the 500 million will be releasedin 2021 AND CEO explains how new stock makes price go up not down (historical proof backs this up). New stock would be used to acquire new theaters around the country and yes, back back debt at a discount but not at the price of dilution."
2021-04-15 13:19:45,wallstreetbets,"That's what he's basically saying, but that's not what he's actually saying.

What he's actually saying are these things:

1) We will use the 43 million 2013 share authorizations to dilute the stockholders in 2021 if we decide to, and

2) We'll try not to use the 500 million new shares to further dilute the stockholders in 2021 if we decide not to, but

3) Push comes to shove, we'll dilute the absolute F*CK out of the owners of this company if we decide that's necessary or desireable and nothing in our statements to the SEC or public prevent this.

Nothing in the SEC or public statements made by AMC prevent further massive dilution of existing shareholders equity in the company."
2021-04-15 18:22:13,wallstreetbets,"These WSB apes are sadly a lost cause. Hopefully we pick up a few of them who are capable of thinking for themselves, but the sentiment here is pure toxicity regarding AMC.

2021-04-15 11:40:46,wallstreetbets,"Also, if you listen to Adam speak, he would only release shares in the best interests of shareholders at very strategic times. Just because no shares in 2021, does NOT mean they will release shares at all in 2022. It could be 2023, 24, 25.

If hedgies somehow last until EOY, the math would look even more wack than it does already. Retail would own like 200 percent of the float by then. That rocket fuel would blast a squeeze to another galaxy, forget the moon."

Finally, why should I pay (with my investing dollar) for AMC to not go out of business (i.e., my money going to pay their furloughed staff while the CEO is getting massive bonus payments?) How many yachts can this guy water ski behind?"
2021-04-15 18:29:41,wallstreetbets,"That's why I'm holding shares and writing covered calls against them and making money that way. There's enough retards here who keep buying and holding to keep the price from plunging too far, and enough smooth brain apes willing to overpay for out of the money options thinking the squeeze is still coming and they're going to get rich.

The stock went from $2.00 to $20.00 in January. That's a 1000% increase. That was the squeeze. Everything that's happened since then has just been a bunch of apes who missed out the first time mistakenly thinking that the squeeze is still coming and overpaying for a stock in a company with no future."

2021-04-15 10:18:00,wallstreetbets,"Better short term potential based on whose opinion? How many blockbuster hits are expected vs how many new board members are being elected? How are sales and rebuilding? Historically, growth and innovation has tended to pay out. GameStop has also paid off their senior notes, while AMC is still in crippling debt. AMC is also a cheap stock so a lot more ‚Äúnewer‚Äù investors would be willing to buy 18 amc shares instead of 1 GME share. It‚Äôs a numbers game of fucking with the simple minded apes imo. AMC bond holders were the winners of the last ‚Äúsqueeze‚Äù when they cashed out their short term notes for stock. AMC‚Äôs ceo keeps giving himself a bonus. GME keeps taking shares away from insiders and I believe they have said they will decrease corporate payout starting from 2022(bullish if true because that likely means the board members expect growth to be that much greater. Remember who they are poaching board members from and the corporate bonuses they likely would have received if they met their goals with those companies). Personally, I believe there was only 1 lemonade stand that was really going on that this sub was aware of(I tried to mention sgry multiple times but kept getting downvotes). Everything else was manipulation to dissuade retail investors who they knew would walk away from the game at the first sign of trouble or loss because they don‚Äôt understand risk management."

2021-04-15 13:28:24,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I know, I've been lurking here for years but since GME it's been wild, comments like this guy *asking* for confirmation bias is pretty funny imo.

2021-04-15 18:39:39,wallstreetbets,"Based on that their competition is going to eat them alive, before the entire industry as a whole tanks.  

What is there evidence in favor of, exactly?  That there is some possibility that they will remain the largest theatre chain in the world, and that the entire theatre industry won't be laid to waste over the next several years?  Even if the latter doesn't happen, the former isn't likely -- AMC has been shuttering locations, Cinemark and Regal are buying out other chains, or the real estate from other chains.  And that was before the pandemic.    Their competition will destroy them, or turn them into a tiny shadow of what they once were, before the entire movie industry folds into a tiny shadow of what it once was.

Based on fucking what evidence, do you see any other possible outcome?"
2021-04-15 12:57:37,wallstreetbets,"Their sell wall is gone, and anyone who bought there is down and they‚Äôre able to rebuy and create a $10 wall again. 

How are you seriously trying to frame ‚Äúhedge funds‚Äù selling $10 as bad for them when the stock is down from $10? Did you start investing a month ago and you buy high and sell low?"
2021-04-15 11:55:16,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs precisely my point. GME is insanely overvalued based on its fundamentals. Even pricing e-commerce stuff in wouldn‚Äôt lead to its current market cap.
2021-04-15 13:28:24,wallstreetbets,"Chewy market cap is 35.52b. Chewy price to sales is 4.97 with forward pe 305.46(yahoo finance).      

GameStop market cap is 10.4b, price to sales 2.18, forward pe -267.95.      

Let‚Äôs not forget that every large company started at the ground."
2021-04-15 13:04:59,wallstreetbets,"Have you seen their balance sheet? They ARE financially weak. But the stock price has zero effect on their daily business other than if they choose to buy/sell shares.

So no, people selling their shares does not cause AMC to declare early bankruptcy."
2021-04-15 16:57:00,wallstreetbets,Is the best long-term strategy to give the CEO a massive 7-figure bonus during a pandemic? Or is that the best short-term strategy for ripping off investors?

2021-04-15 13:25:52,wallstreetbets,"Precisely. It's the company's ""get out of jail free card"" when they do, in fact, sell these 500 million shares in 2021. Nothing in their SEC statement prevents this."
2021-04-15 11:57:50,wallstreetbets,"You say it like those disclaimers never mean anything lol. There‚Äôs a reason they are added - because companies rely on them all the time to do the opposite of what they‚Äôve declared. 

AMC just told you in black and white they will instantly issue more shares if they underperform this year and you‚Äôre refusing to take their words as written. Yet I‚Äôm the conspiracy believer haha"
2021-04-15 13:26:15,wallstreetbets,"They haven‚Äôt issued any shares yet. They are asking for permission from shareholders to issue additional 500m when and if the board determines it‚Äôs needed. 

The current float (ie shares used and available for purchase) is circa 450m. AMC doesn‚Äôt own and doesn‚Äôt control those shares. They are owned by investors. 

They have additional 43m of authorized but unissued shares. Those can be sold by AMC whenever they want to."
2021-04-15 18:11:54,wallstreetbets,Dude they're not going to drop 500m shares at once.
2021-04-15 15:23:27,wallstreetbets,What about the part where he said the previous authorized shares were not touched until 3 years later after approval?
2021-04-15 16:01:28,wallstreetbets,"I don't think they can sell calls? lol.

They have 38m shares they can still sell this year under a previous offering, and enough cash to cover costs throughout the year. So they don't really need the 500m shares to stay in business. They want to use those to pay off their high interest debt, and maybe buy up some of the smaller theaters that are going under. I think there is a risk approval for share sale won't pass which is why they are trying to talk it up to stock holders, personally."

2021-04-15 15:07:55,wallstreetbets,"The CEO & BOD have been burning cash, do you agree with that? Where are they getting that cash from....the trees? They are getting it by raiding shareholder equity. If they had done it without this 500m share issue, AMC would go insolvent. WIPE YOU ALL OUT! Your AMC would become AMCPQ on the pink sheets trading for pennies. But your kind CEO wants to prolong your pain by adding 500m shares to the coffers....FOR THEM. Smh at the financial illiteracy of all the WSB members here.....I expect intelligent talk, but all I see here are laypeople who don't understand shit."
2021-04-15 18:00:56,wallstreetbets,"That already happened. If you want to be an investor in a company like that, it‚Äôs on you, it isn‚Äôt an uncommon thing. You are talking about a company that is multi billions in debt and has half a billion outstanding shares, the CEO getting 25 million is a drop in the bucket. Fact remains. The company will be going bankrupt in short order without a massive capital raise and a massive increase in revenue, if it BKs the stock is zero, doesn‚Äôt matter what the stock price was, what the short interest is, what Godzilla movie is coming out next. etc etc.  I don‚Äôt have a dog in this fight, AMC is fine for a trade as it bounces around, it pays good premium as an option seller. It is a terrible investment for the reasons I have outlined and the unfortunate part for most of the people who have been waiting for this alleged short squeeze is that they are 3 months deep now and have turned a trade into an investment in a failing company."

That‚Äôs all I‚Äôm asking."
2021-04-15 13:28:36,wallstreetbets,"i‚Äôve had nothing but positive emotions. I even told you I hope you make money on your stocks, whatever they might be. At the time of the comment the stock did push through the sell wall. It went past it rather than seeing much resistance. After the fact the stock dropped a little but overall AMC is still up today which is more than I can say for stocks like GME. On top of that the short interest rate jumped from around 3.5% to nearly 15% this week. I‚Äôm happy about it. Let me have my victory even if it‚Äôs a small one.

Talking about obscurity, my earliest and fondest memories of James Earl Jones was in a PBS show ""Long Ago and Far Away."" He was the host and narrator.

The show was about fairy tales and old stories shown in animation (both traditional and stop motion puppetry). It's open up with him on screen like how Levar Burton was on Reading Rainbow.

**How to achieve forced buyback?**  
1. Share recall  
2. Margin call  
3. Small raw buying pressure to push unhedged new options ITM so that hedging provides 'free' upward movement on TACTICAL MOMENTS ONLY.
4. Forced liquidation by DTCC  
5. Hard intervention by the SEC  


Unless one of these happens, the price can go anywhere.... and it doesn't matter if it's $200 or $40 a share...  

**Red days dont mean the squeeze is off, green days dont mean the squeeze is on. The price is fucking irrelevant (unless you're buying, then big red days are something to celebrate)**

You should stop caring. We've been saying this for months, but everytime we have a green day you guys want to celebrate and cheer because ""where lambo"" like a bunch of spoiled children.  And on red days you freak out way too much.


**Get fucking patient**  
For those 5 catalysts that I listed there are many things 'in the works'.  
The DTCC is spewing new regulations like a toddler that ate too much icecream.  
There is a shareholder vote 9th of June, GME hasn't released what we'll be voting on however.  
SEC just got a new head that is known to be anti hedgefund bullshit.  


**What is important?**  
\- Buy if you can. This determines how much exposure you have once we moon. More shares is more tendies.  
\- HOLD. Seriously. Don't daytrade, don't sell. Just hold. Doesn't matter if we're down 50% or up 40%. Stop giving a shit. This will only moon if there are not enough shares to go around. By holding, you are taking your shares and you're saying ""These are mine now. Less to go around"".   
\- Stop fucking promising yourselves dates. Especially if you're smoothbrained. Don't get excited at all. Stop it. You're setting yourself up for constant dissapointment which will paperhand you and ruin this for yourself. Yesterday I told you not to overcelebrate and I was told to fuck off and not ruin the fun. See where the fun yesterday got you? Totally (and without good reason) totally dissapointed today.

Long whales are going to defend that point to bleed large option owners. You know who owns lots of options? People who needed to buy them to reset FTDs and huge short positions. That's who.

We will hover around 150 all day and that is a good thing for us. ""Red bad, green good"" is such an ape-unworthy simpleminded approach to this. Grow some wrinkles for gods sake. Do you want $200 as a price today if that helps shorts by letting them make a shitload of money on options? If you're saying yes then you're seriously almost a real ape.

The fact is that most great marketing results in recognition of names and that name tells a history, and path. So whats the best way to name it. Well we want the name to not only tell what they are but what they do. This led me to think ok lets just call it the E SPORTS CHANNEL or ESC.

However this is where I figured out the perfect name for their channel and what they are doing. They can pay homage to the APEs that helped saved Gamestop by throwing all their crayons and wendys paychecks at Gamestop. Thus we can combine the two and call this new venture, ESCAPE. This will be the lead for Gamestop's new Esports channel.

So obviously I eat crayons for fun, huff paint, and am the smoothest of brains but I think this tribute to us apes with us being memorialized would be amazing."

**What IS important?**

\- Buy if you can. This determines how much exposure you have once we moon. More shares is more tendies.

\- HOLD. Seriously. Don't daytrade, don't sell. Just hold. Doesn't matter if we're down 50% or up 40%. Stop giving a shit. This will only moon if there are not enough shares to go around. By holding, you are taking your shares and you're saying ""These are mine now. Less to go around"".

\- Stop fucking promising yourselves dates. Especially if you're smoothbrained. Don't get excited at all. Stop it.

**Not fucking advice, go ahead and be stupid if you think that's better**

you dumb apes want to hear a secret? Max pain is at 150 ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Long whales are going to defend that point to bleed large option owners. You know who owns lots of options? People who needed to buy them to reset FTDs and huge short positions. That's who.

We will hover around 150 all day and that is a good thing for us. ""Red bad, green good"" is such an ape-unworthy simpleminded approach to this. Grow some wrinkles for gods sake. Do you want $200 as a price today if that helps shorts by letting them make a shitload of money on options? If you're saying yes then you're seriously almost a real ape.

105% institutional ownership. 

Imagine how stupid it would be to lease a car and then go and sell it. Even stupider to sell it to the same dealership I leased it from. When that lease runs our and I need to return the car I'd be fucked.

Hedge funds apparently did the stock market equivalent with GME shares. At least 5% of the shares outstanding were borrowed from institutions and then sold back to them.... and that 5% number assumes retail doesn't own any shares. It's probably more like 10 - 15% 

Better hope institutions never ask for their shares back..."

(This not financial advice.)"
2021-04-15 10:52:36,wallstreetbets,"# Guys I can't believe some of you still dont understand.This will moon when AND ONLY WHEN there is a forced buyback 

**How to achieve forced buyback?**  
1. Share recall  
2. Margin call  
3. Small raw buying pressure to push unhedged new options ITM so that hedging provides 'free' upward movement on TACTICAL MOMENTS ONLY.
4. Forced liquidation by DTCC  
5. Hard intervention by the SEC  


Unless one of these happens, the price can go anywhere.... and it doesn't matter if it's $200 or $40 a share...  

**Red days dont mean the squeeze is off, green days dont mean the squeeze is on. The price is fucking irrelevant (unless you're buying, then big red days are something to celebrate)**

You should stop caring. We've been saying this for months, but everytime we have a green day you guys want to celebrate and cheer because ""where lambo"" like a bunch of spoiled children.  And on red days you freak out way too much.


**Get fucking patient**  
For those 5 catalysts that I listed there are many things 'in the works'.  
The DTCC is spewing new regulations like a toddler that ate too much icecream.  
There is a shareholder vote 9th of June, GME hasn't released what we'll be voting on however.  
SEC just got a new head that is known to be anti hedgefund bullshit.  


**What is important?**  
\- Buy if you can. This determines how much exposure you have once we moon. More shares is more tendies.  
\- HOLD. Seriously. Don't daytrade, don't sell. Just hold. Doesn't matter if we're down 50% or up 40%. Stop giving a shit. This will only moon if there are not enough shares to go around. By holding, you are taking your shares and you're saying ""These are mine now. Less to go around"".   
\- Stop fucking promising yourselves dates. Especially if you're smoothbrained. Don't get excited at all. Stop it. You're setting yourself up for constant dissapointment which will paperhand you and ruin this for yourself. Yesterday I told you not to overcelebrate and I was told to fuck off and not ruin the fun. See where the fun yesterday got you? Totally (and without good reason) totally dissapointed today.

**Not fucking advice, go ahead and be stupid if you think that's better**

# you dumb apes want to hear a secret? Max pain is at 150 ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

2021-04-15 09:29:37,wallstreetbets,"This won't apply to the vast majority of you, but I think this will be both helpful and encouraging to some. I had all my shares in Robinhood ( I know, I know, spare me the ridicule), but I was always hesitant to transfer because I was worried the squeeze would take place while my shares were in limbo sitting between brokerages. However, I decided to transfer half of my shares to Fidelity, that way, if this thing pops off during the extended transfer time, I could still theoretically have control of the remaining half still in Robinhood (assuming they don't pull fuckery again). All that being said, I initiated the transfer of half my shares yesterday morning before market open, and I'm thrilled to say that the transfer completed a few hours ago, and I woke up to the wonderful email informing me of such.   


So, if you feel stuck with Robinhood like I was, I encourage you to use the method that I did, and you should be good to go regardless, and you'll hopefully find that the transfer will take place much faster than expected.   


Godspeed, retards!"

Long whales are going to defend that point to bleed large option owners. You know who owns lots of options? People who needed to buy them to reset FTDs and huge short positions. That's who.

We will hover around 150 all day and that is a good thing for us. ""Red bad, green good"" is such an ape-unworthy simpleminded approach to this. Grow some wrinkles for gods sake. Do you want $200 as a price today if that helps shorts by letting them make a shitload of money on options? If you're saying yes then you're seriously almost a real ape.

So when we moon, I want to try and buy an apartment there, or at least have enough for a down payment. And then I was thinking- why not have an Apes Anonymous meetup at like Universal Studios or something? Nice and public, so you could escape from potential incels, but also: We're going to need some serious coaster action to make up for our GME-adrenalin loss afterwards. What do you guys/girls/attack helicopters/gorillas think?"

Whenever I see people say ""interest rates are going up"" it's portrayed as this cement wall where if it goes up at all it will end home buying. It's been going down over the last 40 years and when it ticks up it inevitably goes down again."
2021-04-15 17:57:43,wallstreetbets,"This is literally it.   The winning YOLOs I've seen are the ones who stick around on great DD and got in way early while others say it's shit.

2021-04-15 12:02:13,wallstreetbets,"Any increase in interest rates will slow down refi's and purchases. It's usually not a big decrease till around 6% though.

Another possibility is that the market prices itself too high and purchasing stagnates. UWMC/RKT will make money on refi's, but not as much on purchases."
2021-04-15 18:58:45,wallstreetbets,It's going down because the US is pushing itself further and further into the abiss that is national debt....
2021-04-15 13:10:38,wallstreetbets,"Housing inventory is down on rising rates. Although housing prices are up because of the exact same reason, (lots of speculators but few houses) it still doesn't change the fact this company buys and packages mortgages, for it to make profit it requires high sales volume and not so much higher housing prices on lower volume. Owning the packaged security is worth more than the guy packaging them. This company is worth more on a rates drop and high volume opposed to a rates rise on lower volume."

2021-04-15 09:14:11,wallstreetbets,"**Daily Stock Market Forecast**

Things are looking bright and sunny today.

* Companies are smashing earnings expectations across the board
* Unemployment is dropping faster than expected. [Initial jobless claims](https://www.dol.gov/ui/data.pdf) were were 576,000, the lowest in more than a year, and well below the forecast of 710,000.
* [Retail sales](https://www.census.gov/retail/marts/www/marts_current.pdf) are booming, up 9.8% compared to a forecast 6.1%.

I'm forecasting a **green day** with a NASDAQ **high of 14,102** and a **low of 13,996**. 

That would put us just a little shy of ATH at today's peak.

*[I try to predict the NASDAQ every day. See past prediction results and visualizations here.](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/944799e4-93a3-4aa3-9a1a-68059d06c4a2/page/yEPBC)*"

It‚Äôs all about earnings today. This a day after Goldman, JPMorgan, and Wells Fargo beat estimates. As I write this, Bank of America, PepsiCo, and UnitedHealth all came in and all beat on EPS and revenues. BlackRock also just reported and was the one outlier, beating on revenues but falling slightly short on EPS.

Still waiting on Charles Schwab, Citigroup, and U.S. Bancorp to round out the banks, but it looks like those ambitious earnings estimates were not misplaced.

Delta Air will report during market hours. That should be interesting where the reopening trend is concerned.

On the data front, we have retail sales and industrial production out this morning. And of course initial jobless claims seeing how it‚Äôs Thursday.

Bottom line: Things are looking pretty good for risk assets. Concerns about JNJ‚Äôs vaccine have faded. The reopening trend remains in force, at least in the U.S."

Red.  Red.  Red.  His hysterical wife screamed at him, her bf whipped him over and over with his belt.  Each day his madness grew but he refused to sell.   Eventually he believed so much that he was right, he stole the bf's car, and drove as far as he could.  He parked it under a bridge and kept updating ""Yahoo Finance"" on his phone.  The car ran out of gas, and the bitter cold of the night took over.  He should have froze to death but no one found his body.  Just a cracked phone with 0 battery.

They say whenever you refuse to sell a weekly call option with no hope, if you feel a chill on your back it might be the hand of the ol' ASO call holder coming to feast on your soul."

2021-04-15 12:49:09,wallstreetbets,"I'm officially out for 90 days after being really stupid yesterday and taking 30k to 15k by FUD around tesla and constantly paperhanding stuff and switching calls/puts.

I am actually going to a therapist about my trading because it got so bad this last month.  Scheduled for 2 weeks from now.


I was up bigly (over 100k - I managed to be someone who had bought GME below 30).  Made money on PLUG, AAL, CCIV, apha, sndl (all the things.)

Then I bought into some other meme stocks (sndl, zom, ocgn, pltr) and this last month had me feeling like I needed to ""make it back"".

I had originally just made patient plays starting last March and that the reason I was up at all. Got lucky on some stuff but didn't fuck with day trades.

This last month I epically fucked myself feeling like I had to get back what I lost.  It became an addiction.  Constantly on Ameritrade, wsb, reading news around my stocks.  Not working, feeling sick, not eating, not working out, not spending time productive or relaxing at all.

As soon as insaw any red in my portfolio I'd freak out feeling like ""oh no I have to fix that."" Even though there was no emergency.  

The worst part is I effectively had 2 stupid days where if I had done nothing I still would have been green on the week. But between just those two days I day traded myself to 40k losses.  I consistently chose fear and emotion over the plan I had set out and couldn't control myself.

I constantly feel like I have to fix it and the only way to fix it is to trade. 

It was really fucking with all aspects of my life.  I'd be happy some days, and completely void of emotion others.  

Since I began trading I'm now down 10k overall.  

Hopefully I can work through my shit- this has been all I do every day for months now.  Stare at the chart.  Get emotional. Have no desire to do anything else.  Make bad emotional decisions after making good logical ones only to erase all gains made over weeks in a matter of minutes.


I consider myself lucky I didn't use the margin available and really fuck myself.  -10k suck, but I know others are worse off.

Maybe I'll never return to trading but I'll keep lurking and commenting.  I love this community, even the gay bears, for all the simultaneous support and shifting on people like me fir their terrible decisions."

Options trading may be the black sheep of taking on leverage according to mainstream schools of thought because of its higher risk, but every extra unit of risk comes with an extra unit of reward. 

If you are young or make too little to have retirement prospects, trading options is no worse an ‚Äúinvestment‚Äù than taking on leverage in any other form. You are in the right place friend"

Take care of your mental health, don‚Äôt invest what you can‚Äôt afford to lose, and keep looking for new opportunities. Don‚Äôt keep holding on to the old thing unless you genuinely want long holds on a stock you truly think has long term value. 

If you‚Äôre just looking to be risky and try new things, once again, DO NOT INVEST WHAT YOU CANT AFFORD TO LOSE.

Sinopec Chairman Zhang Yuzhuo said the company will have 5,000 charging stations and battery swap stations by 2025.

The Chinese EV market has around 85 different EV brands and is super competitive. So at this point there seems to be little reason to get excited that just one of these brands has reached agreement to secure swap facilities with just one line of filling stations, however huge Sinopec is.

2021-04-15 02:03:04,wallstreetbets,"Damn... should‚Äôve sold at least a few! I sold one call then lol 


I feel like the hedgies try to make us get used to the one-two days pop, now we regret not selling right away so next time we see a pop we‚Äôll sell instead of hold. 

But I have a feeling it‚Äôll started to make move by the end of first week of May"

2021-04-15 11:37:44,wallstreetbets,I'm hoping it drops down to like $5 before it goes way up so I can buy enough shares to actually make money.

2021-04-15 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"The most logical APHA/TLRY Merger Play that know one is talking about Okay so long story short, merger date is coming up.  This may sound stupid but it‚Äôs actually the most logical play that know one is thinking or talking about. So TLRY is buying out APHA and therefore your APHA shares will convert to TLRY shares. TLRY is the bigger more valuable company. If you have 500 dollars in APHA it will be converted to TLRY regardless of the share price.  

Here‚Äôs where the hidden logic comes in. The best play is to accumulate as much APHA and drive the price up as high as possible, squeeze out the rest of the shorts and hold.

On the other end of the spectrum sell all of your TLRY shares and beat this ticker to the curb. The lower this goes the better. TLRY actually has a high short interest but trust me let the gay bears have this one.

If the APHA shares can surpass the price of the TLRY shares it will be bigger than the original moon landing.  

Once the merger happens those who have üíéüëê‚Äôs will be rewarded with more TLRY shares than they had APHA shares.  TLRY will then way undervalued and everyone will start to pile in.

If you still don‚Äôt get it, imagine TSLA buying out NKLA, you‚Äôd want NKLA to be as high as possible at the merger and TSLA as low as possible.

I‚Äôve been buying this APHA dip and ready to watch it rip while hoping to see TLRY plummetüöÄüöÄüöÄüåïüíéüëê‚Äòs"
2021-04-15 01:31:45,wallstreetbets,Wut
2021-04-15 02:18:09,wallstreetbets,"I think the flaw in the logic is thinking that at merger all your Aphria money will be used to acquire Tilray stock.
Regardless of price for either stock, at merger each of your Aphria stocks will be converted to Tilray stocks at .8381 to 1. So if you own 1000 shares of Aphria at merger they will be converted to 838 shares of Tilray. Therefore, it makes more sense to want Tilray to be trading higher in price than Aphria, not lower."
2021-04-15 01:41:32,wallstreetbets,"It makes more sense for APHA to tank so people can buy more shares. Those shares will get converted to TLRY shares. If TLRY goes up, APHA people would make more money from the arbitrage difference.

I hope this will make sense in the morning. I‚Äôve had a long day."
2021-04-15 01:46:33,wallstreetbets,So no....you will get .8382 shares of TLRY for every 1 APHA....so not a 1 for 1
2021-04-15 02:03:42,wallstreetbets,This seems.. backwards?
2021-04-15 03:02:43,wallstreetbets,I thought Aphria was acquiring Tilray? It wouldn‚Äôt change anything but I thought I read that Aphria was changing their name to Tilray as it has more brand recognition.

2021-04-15 07:23:27,wallstreetbets,When the merger (possibility) was announced I sold all my TLRY and bought APHA. I think I doubled the amount of shares I had given the price differences - TLRY was rocking at that time and APHA was rocking a little less. I figured with the .83 conversion I was buying future TLRY at a discount. So yeah I hope this merger goes through.
2021-04-15 13:00:20,wallstreetbets,As far as I've seen you'll be getting . 8381 shares of TLRY for every share of APHA you have regardless of price per share... So if TLRY is less then APHA when the merge happens you loose twice... or is my smooth brain missing something?
2021-04-15 01:45:12,wallstreetbets,"As an $APHA bag holder, buy $APHA if you enjoy watching your money disappear.  I would have had more fun setting paper money on fire than buying into $APHA."
2021-04-15 08:03:24,wallstreetbets,I hope you‚Äôre not serious because it doesn‚Äôt matter what the price of Tilray is... the ratio is what matters so if tilray drops to a dollar... an APHA share would only be worth .83 or whatever the exchange ratio is. That‚Äôs what will happen.
2021-04-15 08:22:34,wallstreetbets,The merger dare was pushed from 16th to 30th
2021-04-15 11:36:30,wallstreetbets,Someone smoking too much weed
2021-04-15 17:40:55,wallstreetbets,Tilray coming down to meet Aphria in price is not looking good. The only reason people bought into Aphria even though they would only get .8381 of Tilray was the higher Tilray price making it a wash and the idea of the combined company would be good for all.

2021-04-15 08:30:41,wallstreetbets,How is 50-100 percent gains per year in all her funds (except Israeli fund) not a good enough track record? You‚Äôre clearly not an autist. Tard

2021-04-15 10:18:47,wallstreetbets,Look at the 1 YTD of the ARK invest ETF. In this bull market üòÇüòÇüòÇ now look at any other ETF. Fuck off

2021-04-15 10:10:38,wallstreetbets,Several of her funds are up 400 percent over past five years. Tesla is only 10-12% of each fund. all the growth isn‚Äôt from Tesla.
2021-04-15 10:27:39,wallstreetbets,150 percent YTD is bad?
2021-04-15 10:28:50,wallstreetbets,SPY etf is 50 percent YTD. so you‚Äôre telling me 50 percent returns are better than 150 percent returns?
2021-04-15 10:58:51,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, and my trading account is up that much too, mostly from tesla and my other tech stocks."

I think the risk of the CCP interfering further in the business is extremely low. The only unknown that I am concerned about depressing short-term growth is news about ANT's IPO, but I think even with worst case scenario the news of no IPO comes out, BABA can still hit 300 by year end on its own merit. If positive news about ANT comes out, I think BABA will moon."

Can anyone give me a decent explanation why NOK doesn‚Äôt make large moves? I mean I get that ‚Äúreally really wanting it too‚Äù isn‚Äôt going to get it to move. 

The company legit seems to be making large strides to become relevant again, scoring an AT&T contract, making announcements about cutting costs and working with the EU to push 5G forward across the pond.... 

All of this has brought a windfall of 12 cents. 

Facebook announces they screwed over the majority of its users and the stock goes up 5%. 

I am but a lowly ape and don‚Äôt pretend to understand the workings of the stock market. In fact, can someone point me towards the craps table?

Update: My absolute favorite thing I have learned so far is this. A vast majority of you are like ‚Äústay away. It‚Äôs garbage! Nothing but heartache, yeah I am holding like 500 shares!‚Äù  
This is why I joined this sub! Love you beautiful apes!"
2021-04-14 23:36:49,wallstreetbets,"Because there‚Äôs 5.6 billion outstanding shares and a market cap of $23 billion. So it takes fuckload of buying to move that whale.

TL;DR: supply and demand"

2021-04-15 15:15:43,wallstreetbets,"Nokia stock price doesn‚Äôt make large moves because Nokia hasn‚Äôt proved itself to be successful yet.

Share price being stagnant has nothing to do with how many shares are outstanding. Nokia has 5.6 billion shares outstanding. So what? What does that mean? Do you think if in 2023 Nokia earns .50 Euros per share, the price will still be around $4? Of course not.

Problem is the performance. Previous CEO over-promised and under-delivered. It‚Äôs that simple.
It‚Äôs biggest competitor Ericsson has been managed much better than Nokia.
Ericsson has higher revenues and lower operating expenses resulting in better margins.

HOWEVER, 2021 is a turning point for Nokia and the share price will get to high single digits / low double digits within couple years.

I am heavily invested in Nokia and started a few topics about it. If interested please read what I had to say about it on the last one where I talked about their CMD presentation.

I highly recommend Nokia investors to watch that presentation."

2021-04-15 13:15:18,wallstreetbets,"That $0.12 change in share price corresponds with a $676,680,000 increase in market cap. NOK has a lot of shares outstanding, nearly 6 billion. That's a lot of inertia"

Bell is planning on using Nokia equipment but to what extent?"

2021-04-15 07:34:48,wallstreetbets,Yesterday morning the bid/ask was 1.2 mil bid to 200k ask and it sat stagnant for several minutes then went down to the bid price..... that doesn‚Äôt seem right to me in regards to supply and demand
2021-04-14 23:37:20,wallstreetbets,I can follow that logic... but doesn‚Äôt it benefit the company to have the option of a decent stock price? Or do they honestly not care at the point?
2021-04-15 09:16:13,wallstreetbets,"I like that range, first bought in at $4 even. It teetered between 4-4.01. DAYS! The anticipation was killing me!

2021-04-15 10:28:34,wallstreetbets,"Facebook's model of buisiness is amazing. Same with a lot of other social media. Its a very cheap way to advertise yourself to the world.

Think about how hard it was 10-20 years ago to advertise your company worldwide. Now its easier and way cheaper."
2021-04-15 09:18:03,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôll play as long as there‚Äôs green. Just because it doesn‚Äôt move a lot doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt make money. Just takes more time.
2021-04-15 09:23:56,wallstreetbets,Valid point. I appreciate the input!
2021-04-14 23:32:25,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the info! Don‚Äôt know you but I seriously hope upon hope you survive the upcoming layoffs. Been through it with a different corp that I had 10 years with.

2021-04-15 09:27:25,wallstreetbets,I get the point you are trying to make. However it totally reminded me that you can literally mail animal poo to your enemies. I would once again like to thank the internet in all its glory!
2021-04-15 05:49:14,wallstreetbets,It just did. (4.130 last nights close)
2021-04-15 09:21:42,wallstreetbets,Well since you put it that way with all your factual based information to back up your very emotional comment. I get it now.

Also if they start the dividend again next quarter Wall St will really take notice and it will rise again"
2021-04-15 00:56:43,wallstreetbets,Yes. And DFV being right
2021-04-15 10:37:37,wallstreetbets,That was the catalyst. The reason for the giant  upward move was the short squeeze

2021-04-14 23:39:49,wallstreetbets,Banana trees don't set the price of the banana..it's up for all the apes to decide on the price of banana..

2021-04-15 00:13:09,wallstreetbets,Premiums on Nokia are dogshit.
2021-04-15 07:45:57,wallstreetbets,"I have no clue what goes on with these things... I completely agree with you that it takes a lot more to move the strike price.  However, when I see a bid of 1.2 million at 4.12 and 200 thousand asks at 4.13 I would think it would go to the 4.13  based on the demand for that stock.  I‚Äôve only been watching stocks for a few years though"

2021-04-15 00:18:02,wallstreetbets,If you sell them 1 at a time...
2021-04-15 11:38:40,wallstreetbets,More people trying to buy @ 4.12 than people trying to sell for 4.13
2021-04-15 08:09:04,wallstreetbets,"*‚ÄùI have no clue what goes on with these things‚Äù*

Nuff said."
2021-04-14 23:47:47,wallstreetbets,"Yes, but it's not really in their best interest. Right now so many apes own bananas that even with low banana price, banana Factory is worth 23 billion...banana Factory is happy and has no real need to do anything drastic until they are in deep poo"
2021-04-15 07:01:25,wallstreetbets,"Lol premium as a percentage of capital. Doesn‚Äôt matter how many you sell, the percentage remains fixed."
2021-04-14 23:50:05,wallstreetbets,So if I‚Äôm following you.... apes need to burn down banana factory?!?
2021-04-14 23:55:03,wallstreetbets,"Pretty much. All banana aside...NOK is a good company that I owned a ton of shares in back when they were worth $10 a share. But since then, they released a bunch more shares into the wild...and now because of how available it is...it takes huuuuge amounts of buying demand in order to move the price significantly. The only reason it was moving around a bunch a few months ago was due to meme stock madness.  Typically, it's not a very volatile stock."
2021-04-14 23:58:43,wallstreetbets,"I truly appreciate the info! I mean, stocks that don‚Äôt do much still have their place. I am still trying to figure out the ways of r/thetagang"

2021-04-14 23:52:17,wallstreetbets,"for the special people -- share dilution means the stock price go downsy. guy says no share dilution. any bounce amc gets off this will be because greedy ass wall street priced in their assumptions of amc's greed and amc said fuck right off they're with the apes. 

take how you will.

i love amc. that's where i got my first hand job."
2021-04-14 23:18:44,wallstreetbets,What's the potential outcome of this?

2021-04-14 23:20:38,wallstreetbets,What does this mean for those of us who are holding AMC?

2021-04-15 01:39:14,wallstreetbets,Have more shares in gme than amc but will still buy will my leftover $. Stocks are connected in sentiment and likely shorters at this point

2021-04-14 23:19:32,wallstreetbets,(Borat voice) Vary niiiiice!
2021-04-14 23:41:00,wallstreetbets,"Shorts have to cover at some point. I'd say this is about the time I'd start covering if I was shorting. Mating season for AMC bears is approaching, because they are headed for an inevitable and slippery fucking."
2021-04-14 23:18:39,wallstreetbets,Aron really impressed me
2021-04-15 01:04:43,wallstreetbets,"I mean people that followed AMC knew this, like why would the CEO help the hedge funds thats literally trying to run them to the ground

But newfound respect for the CEO to say this"
2021-04-15 00:28:55,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôve never wished I had more money available to me than right now so I could buy more stock!   FML...I need to find more money.

2021-04-15 01:46:53,wallstreetbets,The stock is going to take off 2moro! I expect at least 10% green!
2021-04-15 00:22:31,wallstreetbets,So my 6/18 $11 calls  won‚Äôt rot on the vine? Well that‚Äôs fun.
2021-04-15 04:20:43,wallstreetbets,"i know WSB was always against AMC. but i hope with this CEO redeemed himself.
most of you still don't realize the fact the the fucking CEO agreed to talk to Trey (promoted the interview on twitter) and to reddit about the company and actually answer all the important questions, spread the FUD, and officially delaying the dilution just for apes. this is huge"
2021-04-14 23:44:54,wallstreetbets,IS WSB CHANGING THE FUCKING WORLD?!?!
2021-04-14 23:47:33,wallstreetbets,So panic hold till 2022 ?
2021-04-15 06:44:05,wallstreetbets,I must say I've never been a fan of AMC but this was actually really fucking nice of him. Makes me wonder.
2021-04-15 06:14:10,wallstreetbets,Thank you AMC
2021-04-15 16:30:25,wallstreetbets,You deserve to eat shit if you short AMC. Cinemas are a part of our lives so fuck off you dirty scumbags. Cinemas are here to stay and keep our sanity.

Generosity rapes greed. AMC forfeits greed to fuck the greedy suits who shorted this lovely company.

Goddamn I love America (-n multi cinemas)"
2021-04-15 07:12:58,wallstreetbets, lets hope this hurts the HFs badly in the short term who are mostly likely the same HFs that also shorted GME to the wahzoo

2021-04-15 01:20:11,wallstreetbets,"So if they are pledging not to use any of the shares they are asking for then why ask for them at all?   

They should resend the request and then resubmit it for shareholders to vote on at a later date.

Also even if they file this they can always change their minds and file a revised filing allowing them to sell the shares when they want which is what they were wanting in the first place."

So, legally, they can still sell them. Things they couldn't do: Use them.

What does that mean? It means absolutely nothing, and the statement is meant to mean absolutely nothing. It is very, very carefully worded."

2021-04-15 10:47:34,wallstreetbets,What it really means is that AMC CEO sold off all their shares to HF's when the price went up. Now they want us to give them more shares so when this Rocket üöÄ takes off they can laugh at US all the way to the bank. I say FUCK THEM!!  OFFER US TOP $$$ FOR OUR SHARE WHEN WE MOOOOON
2021-04-15 04:16:17,wallstreetbets,"""We like what you did to the GME stock price, please make these 500m shares we're sitting on more valuable for us, we have no other path to survive"""
2021-04-15 01:31:37,wallstreetbets,If you can afford AMC you can afford GME. Instead of X shares you just have x shares and instead of moving x it will move X. If both stocks are going to do well at the same rate then it would be smarter to have the stock with the most potential right?
2021-04-15 02:21:10,wallstreetbets,"There are 450.16M outstanding shares on AMC. 500M new shares is OVER a 100% share dilution. If you're a long-time holder of AMC this is poison.

Compare this to GME, which has ~100M outstanding and is only issuing 3.5 million, about a 3.5% dilution.

These aren't nearly the same fucking thing. I could see a 15M share issue, or even maybe justifying a 45M share issue. But anything over 10% share dilution in one fucking year is just fleecing the shareholders.

The fact they're promising not to sell this year means little if you believe in this company's future."
2021-04-15 05:55:46,wallstreetbets,"I WILL VOTE YES AFTER THE SQUEEZE. What all you apes fail to realize is Adam is on his own side. If he states they won‚Äôt dilute until 2022 he wins because he is a shareholder. If the squeeze doesn‚Äôt happen this year and happens in 2022 he wins because he then can dilute. I‚Äôm in this with you guys but you all lack the cut throat ability to say ‚ÄúFuck you I‚Äôm for myself‚Äù. Just watch, someone is going to slip good old DTC some money to keep this shit going until AMC can cash out and guess what? Hedgies win, AMC wins and you all go run and cry to daddy Adam while you buy tickets on Wednesday because you lost all your money. All due to your lack of ability to say ‚ÄúNO, PAY ME FIRST THEN I VOTE FOR YOU‚Äù. Don‚Äôt forget to wipe the cum off your wife‚Äôs stomach when her boyfriend finishes. PAPER HANDED YES VOTING CUCK SACKS"
2021-04-15 06:17:08,wallstreetbets,Wow AMC holders are the dumbest people on the planet.
2021-04-15 01:58:00,wallstreetbets,Trust a CEO on a Wallstreet company where they all are part of the same social club... hard pass
2021-04-15 01:14:44,wallstreetbets,"Is that in writing?  Can he just make another pledge that he changed his mind and 100 million shares were sold on such and such a date, etc.  It's an interview, not some formal  prospectus  or something filed to the SEC.   That's a pledge by a CEO that gave himself a 100 percent raise during a pandemic and near bankruptcy of the company.

With Wanda selling their controlling voting shares, no one is minding the store.   He wouldn't have made this type of request if they were in control of the voting shares.  'Hey can you let the company have half your value in equity by giving us this blank check'.  Because if he did that the next thing they'd be voting on is a new CEO.

But that's the right thing to say by the CEO about this outrageous IMHO proposal, and I'm sure he probably means it at the time of saying it.  But his he really going to have access to 500 million shares, with the stock price high, with a chance at 4 billion in the coffers, or risk it going back down to a dollar in 2022.

Frankly if they do get 500 million shares, it probably would be better for their share holders if they sell it as quickly as possible.  Not having it be a Damocles' sword over the share price.  We've seen what it can do with these  Archegos fiasco stock dumps, shares of VIAC can go up a buck, and then mass selling happens has these banks take advantage of the stock price to unload more of these shares they repossessed."
2021-04-15 07:08:25,wallstreetbets,"This is the same dude who took a huge bonus for doing fuck all when WSB saved his company in the middle of a pandemic? Doubt [x]. 

They‚Äôll dilute the shares when it makes them the most money. This ‚Äúpromise‚Äù is meaningless. This level of dilution will drop the price in half when they decide to drop it."
2021-04-15 04:18:45,wallstreetbets,"From 12/31/2019 they had about 100M shares outstanding and now they have 400M outstanding (might be more). So a 4X increase in shares.

This stock traded at a little over $7 per share at 12/31/2019. Basically, as long as the fundamentals in the company are not improved, how we get to a current share price of $9.5 is beyond me. Just based on stock dilution alone we should be under $2 a share. $9.5 a share now is equivalent to $38 a share prior to dilution. In 2016 the share price hit around $35 before declining.

AMC during 2020 increased their debts (not sure if they paid it back with the shares sales in 2021) as well. Per the cash flow they generated $740M from debt financing in 2020.

Now I am not suggesting that bankruptcy is necessarily a current concern as there is a decent chance that some high demand to watch movies in theaters will help them short-term, but unless something improves on a massive scale about their business I don't understand the optimism about their share price.

In any case, no kidding he is promising not to sell those shares. As it is, this stock is insanely overvalued. Wanda America saw this and dropped the stock. Barring a miracle this stock is eventually headed to sub $2 territory sooner or later."

2021-04-15 01:41:03,wallstreetbets,"Does he say anywhere what he will do to get the debt cleared off slowly over the next 5 years?  There is a reported 10+ Billion dollar of debt currently.  About 200+ Mil in NCD matures next year. About 1.8B gets called off in 2024 and 6B matures in 2026.  Apart from all this there is some convertible debt also.  If we need this company to survive, to do more acquisitions, they will have to make use of the squeeze to sell off some and clear the debt or raise cash. How will he clear the debt if he doesn't sell?"

2021-04-15 11:33:24,wallstreetbets,I Thought someone made a post about AMC trying to get these shares just to sell the company
2021-04-15 11:35:39,wallstreetbets,Just going to use it in 2022 then... duh. When they expect to run out of the money they've got.
2021-04-15 12:03:07,wallstreetbets,That seems stupid of them.

Now the hedge funds will work on a plan to counter that! If he keeps it a secret, the hedge funds can't properly prepare their attacks. Investors are going to buy and hold in any event, your blabbering is only giving away the plan! Fucking moron...this ceo."
2021-04-15 08:19:07,wallstreetbets,God I really wanna root for you amc folks but if you guys haven't figured it out by now I don't know if you ever will.

2021-04-15 00:02:17,wallstreetbets,What use of these if not to sell them for remaining 8 months of the year?
2021-04-15 00:31:19,wallstreetbets,"Wait......no one wants to know if he say ""I would be shittin myself if you believe that! Bwahaha"" after the video is cut? Do we have the full video interview somewhere?"

He wants ‚Äúlong term healthy growth of the stock‚Äù paraphrasing, but he was very clear on this. Translation; I hope you are willing to hold this for 5 years because we are going to use the shares at our discretion over time. Another words, you ain‚Äôt going to be seeing any squeeze on amc. Now we could see a squeeze soon based on the DD I keep seeing. However are HF jacked with cash to ride this out all summer, or possibly until early 2022? Idk, how many months did gme take for that first run up? Anyway, who knows maybe it‚Äôs a great long term hold and one day Amazon will grab them. My vote is still no."

2021-04-15 04:13:56,wallstreetbets,Love those theater rub and tugs
2021-04-15 04:25:40,wallstreetbets,From 12/31/2019 to current they already diluted the shares 4X+. So multiply the current share price by 4 (gets you $38) and look at the historical chart for AMC and let me know the last time they traded at that price. Spoiler... It never ever reached that price. In the end of 2016 it came close before declining the next few years.
2021-04-15 05:05:28,wallstreetbets,"Wow, I just realized AMC is the place I felt my first pussy"
2021-04-15 05:17:46,wallstreetbets,Did it pay well?
2021-04-15 05:18:50,wallstreetbets,"Sir, this is an AMC!"
2021-04-15 05:30:26,wallstreetbets,Was it during a showing of Coraline?
2021-04-15 10:27:35,wallstreetbets,"selling those shares isn't greed, it's funding them from going bankrupt LOL he said 2021 because he thinks they can survive 7 months. 

It's actually greedy for him to assume the company will be at a better stock price next year when they may be closer to bankruptcy, or the market might be in a less favorable place. If that were to happen it would be much worse than if they sold now at a quite favorable $10 share price."
2021-04-15 14:02:10,wallstreetbets,I like the stock.
2021-04-15 16:42:11,wallstreetbets,They might issue 43m shares this year to stay alive until the end of the year. Then maybe 500m in 8 months.
2021-04-14 23:20:36,wallstreetbets,"It is essentially saying ‚Äúhey, we appreciate you so much that we will in no way hinder you in this fight for the entire rest of the year.‚Äù"
2021-04-14 23:48:27,wallstreetbets,AMC $13 tomorrow
2021-04-14 23:22:18,wallstreetbets,no share dilution this year.
2021-04-15 05:27:37,wallstreetbets,I think many shorts had already priced in this share dilution. He just reversed uno them with a bear trap. It's a good time to buy.
2021-04-15 04:43:29,wallstreetbets,"It might go up, or down."
2021-04-15 00:04:13,wallstreetbets,that when the squeeze hapens it doesnt brick the stock and amc gets fked
2021-04-14 23:25:37,wallstreetbets,We don‚Äôt have to worry about possible share dilution until calendar year 2022
2021-04-15 01:17:35,wallstreetbets,"Keep holding, then hold some more"
2021-04-14 23:26:51,wallstreetbets,"Keep holding its good news, but still vote against the dilution."
2021-04-15 06:23:29,wallstreetbets,The stock will go down naturally instead of due to share dilution.
2021-04-15 14:09:10,wallstreetbets,Cant wait to go over Papa Apes for dinner
2021-04-15 07:37:48,wallstreetbets,Finally someone gets it. AMC and GME were movin on in unison before January. People trashing AMC while holding GME are literally hoping the hedgefunds shorting GME recoup money off AMC.
2021-04-15 00:24:48,wallstreetbets,i go to short the AMC! (pause) NOT!
2021-04-14 23:44:02,wallstreetbets,This guy fucks
2021-04-15 01:16:14,wallstreetbets,What shorts? Amc had 71% SI back in Jan and then amc issued 44 mill shares. Price fell after that. Now there's barely any SI on amc..
2021-04-15 08:03:02,wallstreetbets,"No they don‚Äôt. As long as AMC stays in a trough, they can roll those positions until they get to a exit point."
2021-04-15 04:44:14,wallstreetbets,I entirely agree.
2021-04-15 05:52:39,wallstreetbets,"Hedge funds can't run a company down.   
They only can bet on a company being run down by themselves retard."
2021-04-15 02:12:40,wallstreetbets,Same boat.
2021-04-15 02:20:04,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-04-15 07:43:24,wallstreetbets,Correct and this is just delaying dilution for 8 months. Apes don‚Äôt understand this
2021-04-15 00:34:45,wallstreetbets,I have $12 strikes for the same expiry üò©. Hoping they cash in.

2021-04-15 00:00:09,wallstreetbets,Wsb has pretty much only shit on amc..
2021-04-15 09:26:46,wallstreetbets,No. WSB has actively and relentlessly blocked all discussion of AMC and should take no praise for any of the impending good outcomes.

2021-04-15 04:29:27,wallstreetbets,I like to imagine the AMC hate is really just prayers from people already in GME for AMC to wait till after GME squeeze so they can double dip with all the extra buying power.  What's better than 5-10x'ing your investment? being able to dump half that into another 5-10x for a net 10-50x
2021-04-15 01:47:18,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm doubly autistic and hold both stonks
2021-04-15 02:01:01,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm sure they still are, we separated from the pack and doubters of WSB"
2021-04-15 02:32:09,wallstreetbets,25% of these comments are people begging us to buy GME instead of AMC lol
2021-04-15 01:57:42,wallstreetbets,"other, equally as greedy hedgefunds who are riding the wave of longs on AMC, GME, ect. We are only soaking up the leftovers from the big guys slugging it out to the tune of billions of dollars."
2021-04-15 00:15:30,wallstreetbets,"That is the buy job true when you likely see. Furthermore things are said undone with this move. Shoot numbers will, but up or otherwise this will be the game. To the end."
2021-04-15 06:16:15,wallstreetbets,True numbers for AMC about $2
2021-04-15 13:11:41,wallstreetbets,No AA will not flood the market with millions of sharesüíéü¶çüíéü¶ç
2021-04-15 16:48:57,wallstreetbets,"Yep, that‚Äôs what it mean. You will own less % of the company every time they dilute. They already diluted a lot just to stay alive."
2021-04-15 02:23:08,wallstreetbets,I think percent returns on $AMC would be better than $GME whether its a gamma swueeze or a mcsqueeze. But i hold both ü¶çü¶ç
2021-04-15 01:45:42,wallstreetbets,"For some apes, their love for AMC is greater than GME. Many first times have happened in AMC theaters and apes want to preserve that. Also, some may see AMC as less risky than GME and the smaller price/share is attractive to the simpler apes. I personally hold both stonks. Don‚Äôt listen to me tho, I do not give financial advice as I dropped out of business school after my freshman to join the Kin program since they had more attractive lady apes"
2021-04-15 05:30:44,wallstreetbets,"There have only been a few short squeezes in the history of the stock market. There‚Äôs no concrete formula to determine how high either could go so percentages are not really a factor. Why buy one share of GME when you can buy ten AMC shares? Both are clearly being manipulated right now but if there isn‚Äôt a squeeze, which would you rather be bag-holding - AMC at +25% since covid or GME AT +4000%?"
2021-04-15 05:25:24,wallstreetbets,"Same reason he increased his salary by 11 million$ during Covid, while employees were getting fucked: he likes money.

I judge a person by their actions not words. Let's see what he does once he gets his 500 million shares. I don't trust him... He's a greedy boomer."
2021-04-15 01:42:40,wallstreetbets,Why do it later when they can do it now?
2021-04-15 05:35:48,wallstreetbets,"i think they want to buy cineworld (trading at 1‚Ç¨ )

but they delayed this for the apes satisfaction"
2021-04-15 15:31:44,wallstreetbets,"I'm crimxxx, I didn't watch the interview."
2021-04-15 03:41:41,wallstreetbets,"No, that's a split. If a $100 stock splits 2 to 1, you get 2 shares worth $50 each. A dilution is just them adding more available total shares which makes existing ones worth less.   
   
Imagine there is a company worth $1000 and it has 4 shares. You own one, so it's worth $250. Now the company says it wants to issue 4 more shares. The company itself didn't go up in value, so now you own 1/8th of the company instead of 1/4th. Your share is worth only $125 now."
2021-04-15 05:45:21,wallstreetbets,üÜô
2021-04-15 13:40:50,wallstreetbets,"This is the thing. Has anybody even watched the whole video? AMC has had shares since 2013 when they were issued. They waited THREE YEARS to use any of them, and then used more FOUR YEARS LATER in 2020. A A-Ron said they want to have the shares handy, like a tool in their kit in case they are needed. They have 43millions still plus more if it gets voted through. Clearly they don‚Äôt want they stock to be diluted, he even points out the two times they used their shares the stock ROSE. All these may-saying hoes that ain‚Äôt even watched the whole video spreading FUD"
2021-04-15 16:46:07,wallstreetbets,"AMC won‚Äôt dilute any new shares in 2021. Basically saying, ‚Äúwe‚Äôve done this before, trust us, any future dilution will be beneficial for all‚Äù"
2021-04-14 23:58:22,wallstreetbets,"Maybe, but the interest rate to borrow shares to short is starting to skyrocket, jumping around 5% just this week. No way they can survive till the end of the year at the current rate. However you do have a point; I could see them allowing a small squeeze, followed by a big dump (price shoot to $30, then back down to like $10) to try to use FOMO to get some shareholders to relinquish shares so they can try to survive till 2022. But no way can they keep price suppressed under $10 until 2022."
2021-04-14 23:26:52,wallstreetbets,"But this also puts AMC apes at ease since they won‚Äôt have to worry about share dilution this year. That‚Äôs also if the new 500 million shares are voted to pass to begin with, which we do not yet"
2021-04-15 05:33:53,wallstreetbets,"maybe but with no additional shares retail will gobble all the remaining float until end of the year in worst case scenario.
best case scenario if we follow the numbers:fee is going up again, utilization is at 97%, no institution dumps, new sec rules coming in, we could see the squeeze in 3 months tops. i know calling dates is bad, but ..."
2021-04-15 07:47:40,wallstreetbets,Amc apes dont pay interest.
2021-04-15 08:10:54,wallstreetbets,"I think it was the exact opposite, I think they just came to the conclusion they were on the wrong side and they are quickly trying to be on the side that won't crush them afterwards... That might be no sides now though..."
2021-04-15 05:01:25,wallstreetbets,If you haven‚Äôt watched the full interview you should. He explains they don‚Äôt just dump it on the market all at once. Each time they do use those shares the stock price has went up in the past 8 years.

2021-04-15 07:17:58,wallstreetbets,"Why are you voting yes other than, because CEO says to vote yes?"
2021-04-15 07:59:06,wallstreetbets,For future. They have shares still in reserves now (30m) that is more then enough for this year. He mentioned he wants to use the shares to buy another cinema chain or possibly cut out some debts which would contribute to longevity of AMC and possibly bring in profits.
2021-04-15 13:10:57,wallstreetbets,No it‚Äôs for possible acquisition or mergers. Also to pay off debt(rent etc.)using shares üíéü¶çüíéü¶çüíé
2021-04-15 05:47:06,wallstreetbets,squeeze will happen by the time dilution hits
2021-04-15 07:55:03,wallstreetbets,Misleading? For the entire year is still long af.
2021-04-15 04:59:07,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs not what I got from the interview at all.
2021-04-15 02:28:07,wallstreetbets,"If people paper hand at 1000, id like to be in $AMC to 1000 than $GME to 1000. I think they have similar squeeze potential. And im an indecisive autist so i hold both"
2021-04-15 01:42:30,wallstreetbets,"Agree, I buy gme first and leftover money after goes to amc just because my autist brain likes whole share #'s. Have nearly x10 gme shares though"
2021-04-15 04:05:36,wallstreetbets,"The fact that he asking for 500 million shares to double the float is disgusting and greedy.  First off, that's the thanks that retail investors get when they have been propping the stock up from the dumpster fires it was.  He wants all their sh*t.  It's not,  'Hey if you give me a quarter share, it will help us, and in the end your investment will be worth more in the long run'.   No, he wants all the current market capitalization and then some because he thinks you're unsophisticated investors and can take advantage of that fact.  

And now who knows when he'll sell those shares, so it adds unpredictability for all of 2022, at best.   Definitely no upside when those shares are being sold, price will go down.  And man that's a lot of shares to sell.  They're still selling those Archegos shares on some stocks and it's been weeks later, and it's tanking stocks, and it sure wasn't over 100 percent of the existing shares."
2021-04-15 08:09:27,wallstreetbets,"I think more likely that they see that even though they dumped a bunch of shares already the dilution was pretty small and maybe got the shorts in a worse position thinking everyone was going to bail. I bought more..... AMC has been slowly following GME's lead, I expect they announce that they buy back debt bonds early or something now too."
2021-04-15 02:21:47,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, he sounded too retarded to be in the same club. For someone who has a Harvard MBA and been an executive for half his life, he sounds like the rich guy who doesn‚Äôt fit in in Caddyshack.

Made him more likable."
2021-04-15 03:26:58,wallstreetbets,"This is a binding argument, they have to file this if it goes through"
2021-04-15 05:43:12,wallstreetbets, but you trust cohen?
2021-04-15 01:42:06,wallstreetbets,"He stated that they pledge and will also FILE, so we just gotta keep an eye on the filing to see if they follow through which I see no reason as to why they wouldn‚Äôt. 
As far as Wanda, the CEO talks about them during the interview. I forget around what time so I apologize. 
I‚Äôm personally voting for no increase in shares, but even if it passes it‚Äôs not the end of the world. They won‚Äôt dump on us all at once and they don‚Äôt want to have to sell those shares. But with the COVID situation still developing, they need security in case they get in trouble. 
Here‚Äôs the link to the inter view, he starts talking about the 500m shares at 53:57

2021-04-15 07:17:45,wallstreetbets,Can‚Äôt be legal can it ? üëÄ
2021-04-15 07:45:04,wallstreetbets,"How dumb are you? CEO promises 90% of the share holders something and lies? Guess what happens if those retailers jump ship? Nevermind the 50% drop from 500m issuance, another 80% drop on top of that. Its also a binding agreement Adam made. He would open up so much legal recourse for lying to share holders and would end up in jail."
2021-04-14 23:56:43,wallstreetbets,At that point it's not fucking us. They desperately need the money but promised not to fuck with the squeeze. Bullish af
2021-04-15 00:49:25,wallstreetbets,"Bruh....no shit people only care about their own company. The mans job is to be the CEO of the damn company, if he‚Äôs not putting his best foot forward he‚Äôs going to get fucking axed. Like this is the mans career on the line, what the hell do you expect the man to do? Pick you over himself and his family? You don‚Äôt get into the stock market expecting people to be utopian and fair, use the tools at your disposal ti make the best financial decisions possible. You need to remove your emotions from stock market trading, this is an extremely dirty game with no room for emotions."
2021-04-15 00:47:32,wallstreetbets,"Nope, they currently have around 45 million shares available to dump if they wished to do so but they‚Äôre not. They want the 500 million shares as a security in case they need the emergency cash. Check out the interview, he further talks about their plans with the new shares. Time ticker 53:57 for when he talks about the shares

https://youtu.be/XjqCaNKsSbc"
2021-04-15 00:51:55,wallstreetbets,"No, they still have over 40m of shares from the last addition of shares in 2013. He isn't going to dump 500mil at an exact day. He's slowly going to add the shares in three years time and we'll already have your squeeze."
2021-04-14 23:22:41,wallstreetbets,Speculation.  He specifically brought up two previous events where they weren‚Äôt used for years.  And in all cases resulted in share price increases
2021-04-14 23:26:34,wallstreetbets,Explain why you think they will ‚Äúprobably‚Äù use the shares in 2022.
2021-04-15 00:57:04,wallstreetbets,I doubt he will leave this year.
2021-04-15 04:25:43,wallstreetbets,Or short squeezed
2021-04-15 03:30:30,wallstreetbets,"Guy got the company through a pandemic, prevented  two times a bancruptcy, I dont think this will impact his role as CEO. Movies open up a gain and cashflow picks up, sit back and watch"
2021-04-14 23:30:06,wallstreetbets,"He stated that they will file, so as long as they do then we got nothing to worry about for this year"
2021-04-15 12:01:53,wallstreetbets,$20 a month for 3 movies a week isn't affordable enough for you? Food though yeah...
2021-04-15 07:57:36,wallstreetbets,"Watch the interview. He said the last time they approved 300m shares, they didnt use any for 3yeafs. When they did the made a purchase and the shares jumped to 30$. He said multiple times, he will use those shares responsibly. AMC didnt survive 100years by bullshitting its share holders."
2021-04-15 07:58:46,wallstreetbets,becuase its out the money?
2021-04-15 08:06:34,wallstreetbets,"How would this do anything but put $1 in someone else's pocket? That's the definition of ""just giving away money""."
2021-04-15 02:11:49,wallstreetbets,They filed it officially
2021-04-14 23:57:44,wallstreetbets,"It means there will be a short squeeze before they dilute everyone. Meaning, profit from squeeze then sell the stock forever"
2021-04-15 00:09:59,wallstreetbets,"That‚Äôs if they exercise selling ALL 500 million shares. They do not want to do that, they want them available in case they need to raise funds for an emergency"
2021-04-14 23:57:43,wallstreetbets,"Even if the 500 millions new issued shares did come to pass, they would not saturate the stock all at once. Maybe a a few tens of millions at a time at different time periods after 2021. They would only be there for emergency use."
2021-04-15 05:24:30,wallstreetbets,Amc is more shorted than GME
2021-04-15 01:37:49,wallstreetbets,They have enough cash to last them the rest of the year. They also have an available 43 million shares they can choose to sell from previously raised shares
2021-04-15 02:10:48,wallstreetbets,No more fud
2021-04-15 02:12:11,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs filed officially
2021-04-15 01:13:53,wallstreetbets,I'm going to believe the guy who has 3 million shares in the company more than the guy who has been on reddit for 3 months
2021-04-15 02:12:16,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs filed officially
2021-04-15 00:45:15,wallstreetbets,"Basically so if something bad happened, like covid for example, they'll be able to come up with money to bail themselves out"
2021-04-15 00:45:22,wallstreetbets,"He goes on to further explain why they want to issue the 500 million new shares and how they would be used if they needed to use them. Here‚Äôs a link to the interview, time ticker when he talks about the shares is 53:57

2021-04-15 14:15:09,wallstreetbets,He meant his mom blew on his pop corn because the butter was too hot. He was seconds away from screaming.

2021-04-15 08:32:22,wallstreetbets,"He said that even then, he still doesn't plan on issuing the shares unless it makes sense for the company to do so once 2022 rolls around. 

The hedges were planning that Adam dilute his stock at the worst possible moment for some dumb reason, which is no longer true even if he does receive approval to issue more shares."
2021-04-15 06:04:17,wallstreetbets,"Yep, why give them a timeline .. vote NO still I reckon"

2021-04-15 01:56:46,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôve been beating this drum for a while now. Everything AMC is doing is to ready itself for a buyout. Amazon & Disney are out there sharpening their knives.
2021-04-15 06:45:04,wallstreetbets,I really hope you're joking but I can't tell.

2021-04-15 00:23:19,wallstreetbets,"this would make my April 16th options very happy

&#x200B;

edit: I think. not really sure as I am of clan tard."
2021-04-15 04:23:17,wallstreetbets,"They already diluted the shares a massive amount this year. Just no new share dilution. They raised enough money to cover paying their bills for the rest of the year already. The question is what happens next year. In any case the share price is detached from reality so is bound to go down a significant amount sooner or later, barring some miraculous turnaround that would boost the company higher in value then it has ever been.

To put this in perspective, AMC is trading compared to the years pre-COVID at above its all-time highs, when you factor in share dilution. So to justify the current share price the company would not only need to meet its former high-marks (from back in 2016) it would have to exceed that.

In other words, AMC is a terrible investment."
2021-04-15 12:45:34,wallstreetbets,Good time to buy trading at the equivalent of its ATH after dilution? Hmm...
2021-04-15 00:08:10,wallstreetbets,Regardless of him saying this.. I voted against both mentions of the further stock issuance.
2021-04-15 00:30:35,wallstreetbets,"That isn't exactly true, they still have around 43mil shares they can issue from 2013 that they can use in this year if they want to."
2021-04-14 23:52:32,wallstreetbets,"Be careful about that shit getting priced in early though. This is the kind of CEO that would do it Jan 1st,2022 to ‚Äúkeep his word‚Äù. Or just straight do it in 2021 cause they need the money to pay off loans. Please don‚Äôt interpret this as a CEO actually giving a fuck about the retail investor. They don‚Äôt and never will"

2021-04-15 13:04:52,wallstreetbets,The shares will be used next year for possible acquisitions or mergers.. AMC may also use shares to pay landlords or other debt. AA will not dilute the market with millions of shares. üíéü¶çüíéü¶çüíéü¶çüíéü¶çüíé
2021-04-15 15:26:53,wallstreetbets,You obviously didn't watch the video.
2021-04-15 02:19:49,wallstreetbets,You can bet on it
2021-04-15 04:52:25,wallstreetbets,Ooh ooh ahh ahh
2021-04-15 04:45:02,wallstreetbets,"There is literally no rationale for the optimism here with AMC. GME is much better off. Here are a couple of comparisons.

AMC - Since 2019 diluted their shares 4X. In 2020 they also took on more debt.

GME - No share dilution (yet) and recently just announced they are paying back some debt.

AMC - In midst of a multi-year decline with nothing that I am aware of to turn it around.

GME - Ryan Cohen came in and is assembling a great team in order to transform the business (I have no idea if they succeed or not, but the fact is they are out to make changes).

IMO, they are both trading way too high, but at least GME has a plan to turn around the business that if it works out might actually justify the share price. I don't think the gamble is worth it there and personally think the share price should be sub $60 (I would not buy at least until it falls under $40, if that ever happens). In any case, AMC, literally has nothing going for it and will probably in a matter of time fall to under $2 per share."
2021-04-15 01:01:19,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs only the ‚ÄúGME only‚Äù crowd. WSB is how I heard of AMC‚Äôs stock and got into investing in it in the first place
2021-04-15 00:59:55,wallstreetbets,They hate it cause it's not gme...
2021-04-15 10:07:31,wallstreetbets,They‚Äôre gonna hate us DOUBLE when the AMC üöÄüöÄüöÄ happens before GME.
2021-04-15 00:55:43,wallstreetbets,Sounds like you're first on their list.
2021-04-15 06:50:30,wallstreetbets,Nah its gme holders at 200 and 300 waiting to unload their bags when more people comes in. I have both and I've averaged down my gme. I feel amc has much more potential tbh.

changed my tactic with gme, shorting it via CFD (not affecting the price, just betting on price action, don't scream), taking my profits and going long into amc since movies will never die"

2021-04-15 05:41:31,wallstreetbets,Hopefully enough shareholders voted against.  I did before I sold my position.
2021-04-15 01:55:00,wallstreetbets,"Because it sends the wrong signal to shareholders specially when CEO has to go so far to make a statement that they won't use them.  

Say to me they don't need them now. so why ask for them now?"
2021-04-15 05:47:30,wallstreetbets,"That would be pretty risky move with how things are going overseas with the up tick in covid cases.  Some areas may end up back in lock downs again if they continue increasing in cases.  We still have new hot spots popping up in some states that opened up earlier than others and now they are spiking in cases.  

Plus the major films got pushed back again for release dates so that isn't favorable for any movie theater company."
2021-04-15 05:15:08,wallstreetbets,"If that is so then great but share price increases could be due to many other reasons, share dilution is never something to be hyped about, I tend to never trusts suits but I remain cautiously optimistic."
2021-04-15 07:22:13,wallstreetbets,"Because the CEO knows what the fuck he is talking about, if you dont see that then no amount of reason will get through to you. I don't have to explain shit dipshit."
2021-04-15 09:18:31,wallstreetbets,Bro the earth is like billions of years old.
2021-04-15 02:23:53,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-04-15 04:45:55,wallstreetbets,"He needs to give us more. There are worlds I could see 100% increase in outstanding being justified.

For example, if the company changed its executive compensation model to something like holding half the outstanding and paying dividends. The executives wouldn't own those shares, the company would. But executives would be compensated via dividends earned from those shares.

Or if AMC had a real long-term plan to enhance its value. Movie theaters are always going to exist. Home streaming is about as much of an existential threat as HBO was. People go to the movies for the experience of the big screen. But to justify such a new issuing, there needs to be some type of transformation.

Or if AMC had SUCH bad debt, if they don't raise the money they'll go bankrupt. Well, 100% dilution is better than bankruptcy for the shareholders. This might be the case, as AMC does have roughly 5 billion in debt. But throwing all the debt at the shareholders at once is a bit unnecessary. 

Either way, shareholders should get value from the existence of those new shares. But this is not a ""Trust us"" situation, like I said it's poison for the stock price."

They are implementing all sorts of innovative new ways for people to enjoy the movies during covid and with kong vs zilla they proved that people still want to go to the movies even when they could watch it at home and are only at 60% capacity. Plus the share price is staying up do to massive shorting that is at an all time high thanks to all the diamond handed apes and just recently passed GME. Also Adam just delivered a gut punch to short seller's by guaranteeing that no new shares would be issued this calender year and would only be issued in the future to the benefit of the company and its share holders..

2021-04-15 08:47:51,wallstreetbets,"Again, why would it matter if Adam himself shows how AMC used dilution to help raise the price of the stock back then?

Your only reason to vote against it is because you don't trust the company in wanting to keep the price up, which is a detriment to Adam and the executives within AMC if they were to lower the stock price due to dilution. 

Not suggesting you vote yes/no, I'm just saying unless you have any solid DD that shows AMC can't be trusted with the 500 mill, then I dunno what to say other than claiming hedges can keep playing leverage with banks/brokers for the remainder of this year (which is also not true unless Adam will issue more shares out of nowhere) seems unlikely."

2021-04-15 07:30:57,wallstreetbets,"You don't need to issue new shares in order to make an acquisition. Just becuase you do buy another company doesn't mean it's a guaranteed success. # of outstanding shares has quadrupled in 2 years. Issuing new shares to raise some capital isn't horrendous. But issuing 4x the amount of shares is wildly horrible. And now they want to vote to issue even more for 2022??? And people are cheering st this video?? That's legit retardation, not the good fun autist thinking employed here. 

So I think you're joking. Becuase you don't need to dilute stock in order to merge or buyout another company. And just becuase you do buyout another company, doesn't mean it always works out and ""double or triples""  the stock price.

2021-04-15 06:56:58,wallstreetbets,An actual different story. It may have started as a meme but real moves are being made and the brand recognition is at an all time high.
2021-04-15 07:38:44,wallstreetbets,"I have spent more time looking at GME and my takeaway is that while I think it is valued too high (I would not consider buying shares unless it went under $40) they are in a very different situation. 

For one, they did not need to raise funds to remain operational, in fact they recently announced they are paying back some debt. If they are raising funds (via any share sales... I am not sure the status of that though) it would be part of their plan to turn around the business.

They also recently had the whole top level of the business turned over and you have people with the experience now and drive to change this business in place. If they are successful, I think it is not hard to come up with valuations that justify the current price (but this is a big if).

I do remain skeptical that they will be able to change around the business and drive enough future profitability/cash flow to justify the current price (i.e. I think a value of essentially $10B+ on a nonexistent online business is a bit much, even with the brand recognition and great team in place) so remain bearish on them but would not advise anyone to bet against them (based on both the future prospects and the nature of the retail investors in it).

Interesting, could be the whole short-squeeze thing and the interest it is driving is a text book case in reflexivity. Shareholder support in this case allows or causes the business to turn around which in turn can make the business into a fundamentally valuable enterprise."
2021-04-15 09:13:25,wallstreetbets,Yes both will make us rich
2021-04-15 05:44:51,wallstreetbets,"All time high I think is about $34 back in 2016.

Considering the shares have been diluted over 4X since 12/31/2019 a current shares price of $9.5 is at least equivalent to a share price at 12/31/2019 of $38. That is higher then it ever traded in the years before COVID.

This is math and facts, not opinion."

2021-04-15 05:39:37,wallstreetbets,You clearly don‚Äôt like money
2021-04-15 14:32:30,wallstreetbets,"Per their 10-K filed with the SEC on 3/12/2021 the shares outstanding at 3/11/2021 are:

Class A = 450M

Class B = 0

&#x200B;

On that 10-K on the balance sheet as of 12/31/2020 the outstanding shares are:

Class A = 173M

Class B = 52M

&#x200B;

On that 10-K on the balance sheet as of 12/31/2019 the outstanding shares are:

Class A = 52M

Class B = 52M

&#x200B;

Per that filing the Class A and Class B shares have equal economic interests. The Class B shares were owned by Wanda America and had special voting rights (Wanda since year end closed their position).

So some basic math... At 12/31/2019 there were 104M shares outstanding. At 12/31/2020 there were 173+52= 225M shares outstanding and as of 3/11/2021 there were 450M shares outstanding.

So from 12/31/2019 to 12/31/2020 they increased the shares by 116% (2.16X)

From 12/31/2019 to 3/11/2021 they increased the shares by 332% (4.32X)

In 2021 alone they increased the shares by 225M or 100% from 12/31/2020.

This is all info reported on their 10-K and you are welcome to go look it up yourself. Either AMC is lying in their filings to the SEC or they diluted their shares in 2021 as described above.

So current stock price of $9.74 at 4.32X is $41.08 equivalent share price as of 12/31/2019."
2021-04-15 09:30:43,wallstreetbets,Over 4X dilution that is $9.5 x 4 = $38 pre-COVID price. Highest price was in 2016 at around $34 per share.
2021-04-15 12:43:52,wallstreetbets,Why is it a $20 stock after covid? I‚Äôm honestly dying to hear your explanation of that given that prices it more than double over it‚Äôs all time high.

2021-04-15 09:50:03,wallstreetbets,"There are 450 million shares outstanding for AMC. 500 million new shares are over a 100% dilution. If you do want to hold AMC for the short term and long term, such dilution is massive and poison for the stock price.

Even if the company doesn't sell, it affects the share price. Because institutions and ETFs value companies with their market cap, not the share price. Overnight the market cap is doubled from the new shares. Companies looking at this will see the company as even more overvalued causing institutions and ETFs holding the stock to sell off to rebalance their portfolios. Causing a drop in the share price in the short term.

Down the road, when the company does go to sell, be it two years from now, the shares will dilute the price even more, as rallies get sold off.

And for attracting new investors, why not just wait until after the dilution so I can buy the stock for half price?"

I do wonder though if you're so sure about this assessment have you shorted amc?"
2021-04-15 07:25:25,wallstreetbets,Its almost like fundamentals dont matter for a squeeze. Also Tesla has 1b shares and trades for more then every other auto maker stock combined. Please dont come into the argument about share count when retail owns 90%.
2021-04-15 05:56:45,wallstreetbets,Well do you know why it hit that all time high? Its because they issued more shares to finance the acquisition of several struggling movie chains. Saving them and their shareholders from bankruptcy. Why would they purposely dilute the shares of their company if it wasn't in the best interest of their shareholders and the company itself nc you have to remember that the AMC board of directors are all shareholders themselves. Right now AMC is set to come out of the pandemic as one of the top movie chains in the world and they are primed for a short squeeze right now if you look at all the data on ortex combined with the fact that their ceo just legally pledged to not issue anymore share in 2021. All that being said I fail to see how AMC is a bad investment like you said in your first comment.
2021-04-15 07:04:06,wallstreetbets,"As someone invested (in a very small part) in AMC, I not only enjoy, but appreciate research like OP. It‚Äôs important to take in as much information as possible about stocks and come to your own conclusion. I‚Äôm happy to hear about no new dilution for year, and will continue holding, but love reading hear cases as well, as they ultimately inform my decision process, which again, has landed me on holding my position Strong for now."

Your math doesn't mean a thing if AMC decides to issue only an additional 20 million, 30 million, 10 million, or no new shares. And as Adam demonstrated and said, AMC doesn't plan to dilute the price unless they see an attractive opportunity to do so (which has caused a price increase in the stock itself if you seen past events).

The only reason why the number is that high for the requested share amount is because Adam wanted to get that amount all at once instead of issuing smaller amounts of stock over time.

In order for a SS to happen, bothing instituitional and insider holdings need to be high %. Becuase if retail owns shares they will be paperhanded easily. Look at GME or VW, you need insider ownership to be high bevuase they don't sell. 

GME insider ownership is above 100% I believe. AMC is 2%. Also shares outstanding is multitudes lower. Way to big of a float, shorts will be able to cover. And what is SI anyway, pretty sure it's way lower than what it once was."

You really think the memestock wave is going to push gamestops nonexistent online platform ahead of steam quickly? In my opinion that's highly delusional"
2021-04-15 09:27:09,wallstreetbets,"Institutional ownership figures are almost certainly overstated. The issue is most don't have to file till Jan 2022 when they sell, so there is no reliable way to know this data now.

Share recall is likely nothing. Passive funds (Blackrock and Vanguard for example) lend their shares to make the fund company money. As they are passive funds they don't buy or sell based on the price movements and they don't care to vote (recalling shares to vote would prevent them from earning interest, so it runs against their interest to recall them). Just to be clear, the shareholders can recall shares, not the company.

As to the rest, like I said, I remain skeptical on their ability to build up their online business, but definitely if it works out then perhaps it is a great investment."
2021-04-15 09:29:49,wallstreetbets,"Like I said, my bearish view is on the price to pay to hope they turn around the business. Without successfully building a cloud business the company is worth a lot less then they are trading at now. The fundamentals, in terms of operating, are great, but based on that you probably get some share price in the range of $20-$60. You need the transformation to justify the higher price it trades at."
2021-04-15 06:04:17,wallstreetbets,"I agree that there is always the possibility the business can turn around and go up in value. I am pretty much just going based on the dilution math and looking at the history that this company was in decline in the years leading up to COVID.

As to being short, I bought a little while back a few puts. Nothing significant (I really don't feel like taking the time to dig extensively into the company as the money I have involved here is not sufficient to justify spending much effort). I would not recommend anyone to short or buy puts as I think there is way too much a chance that retail investors keep on buying AMC and propping the price up for a while to come. My puts are a small lottery ticket that will only pay off if retail finally loses interest in propping up the share price. Given the announcement now that they are not diluting anymore, seems more likely then before that the price can remain propped up for a while still."
2021-04-15 06:33:11,wallstreetbets,"haven't read future comments, but so far I have to agree with aka0007.  If you've watched the way AMC has been trading since January, it's not like GME.  I wouldn't expect anything big happening from it in the likes of GME.  I haven't done any research, but from simple observation, I'm expecting it to dip, probably as low as $7, maybe even $6, then I can buy, then it should come back up to about $12 or so.

People wanting to go to the movies will be there.  I want to go, but last I remembered, they've added commercials, raised their prices for food, and a whole other lot of things I found unnecessary.  Which is why I no longer go.  They need to find a way to make the older generation want to go back.  The newer generation will always go because it's a new experience for them.  This is like the revolving door theory with mobile games and microtransactions, if you know what I mean.  They could try building a restaurant within, like Dave and Buster's.  They can try bringing back the arcades.  They need to try something instead of jacking up the price of popcorn and banning people from brining in their own food and making us pay $5 for a bag of gummy bears."
2021-04-15 07:43:32,wallstreetbets,What does Tesla have to do with this? The price of Tesla is not the result of a short squeeze. If a short squeeze played a role in the past in its price increase it is no longer that relevant (short interest is pretty stable the last 6 months).
2021-04-15 06:19:03,wallstreetbets,"The short squeeze seems pretty unlikely. On 3/31 the short shares were at 73.8M, against, I think, 450M shares outstanding (so about 16.5% short interest).

As to why they issued shares, I am not questioning that. They issued shares as they were facing bankruptcy due to being unable to get financing. Then retail jumped on AMC and drove the price up, making raising funds via share sales much easier. There is no mystery here. The end result is you still have the dilution. Dilution is a necessary evil for companies, not a benefit for shareholders.

As to coming out of the pandemic... No idea what to expect. I did not do much analysis on that aspect."
2021-04-15 06:37:22,wallstreetbets,Literal nonsense.
2021-04-15 15:51:31,wallstreetbets,"Float just deducts the restricted shares from the Outstanding shares. In AMC's case the shares sold in 2020 and 2021 were, I believe, sold on the open market and would be added to the float."

2021-04-15 14:14:32,wallstreetbets,"The all time high was $35. Since then they‚Äôve quadrupled their shares.

The reason we hate it is that nobody who looks at the graph accounts for the quadruple float. Past price is irrelevant when you factor in dilution.

For them to justify $35 they need to have an EPS of 4x what they did when they were $35."

I also have some AMC. Not much. I'd have more if I could because I like it. I just don't have the cash to buy more. Frankly, I feel better about it than GME (don't rag on me! I am just not a gamer!) I could never afford GME and never did have a good feeling about it. Not the feeling I need to buy a stock. I do very well on the stocks I have because I listen to my gut. I didn't get that gut feeling with GME. It wasn't for me. Besides, I found WSB too late to get in on it.

Even if the events of covid were out of the CEO's control, they also can't take credit for the rise in stock price. Now the company is still billions in debt and needs the shareholders to bail them out.

In the long run, I guess another 100% dilution (on top of the 300% AMC has had this year alone) is better than bankruptcy. But pretending this doesn't have an effect on the share price is naive at best."

I dont know any other squeeze besides VW but I can say with some certainty tgat 100s of squeezes happen per month in the world markets and many of them probably happen without high insider shares. I think the fact woth AMC is that we have a massie SI and AMC is currently being shorted way higher than GME. There's these yellow lines every amc streamer is showing above the graph that indicate how heavily shorted s stock is and its the highest its ever been all this past week. Gme is way lower.

2021-04-15 17:45:03,wallstreetbets,"What good will a cloud business do? The mistake with all of the game counsels was making their games downloadable direct to the counsels. It made the actual games unnecessary. 

The only place they're really necessary now are in rural areas like mine that have crappy internet connections. My son can't even do updates unless he takes his game counsel next door  (which for some reason can get AT&T, but I can't). My neighbor is on the corner, on the main road. I'm the first house on the side street when you turn. The big internet companies service them, but not me. Apparently I face the wrong way and have too many trees (even though I have an AT&T cable in my yard & running into my house). 

So, I'm stuck with Hughesnet which is WORTHLESS & limits my GB's monthly. I can watch MAYBE one and a half movies & I'm slowed way down. After that, I'm using my mobile connection.

Seems to me, if GME wants to continue selling the actual games, they need to change their marketing and direct it towards the rural areas and start directing their brick & mortar stores there, too, if they'll let them (we don't like big stores - we're mom & pop, neighborhood store people)."

On top of that, the stockholders will be pulling out before their stock values drop to worthless, & they'll have nobody waiting in the wings to buy up any more because of shady practices such as these - not to mention the total disregard for their shareholders' pockets.

From a fundamental point of view, AMC is garbage. Sure there is hope, but for what upside? A 200% gain. If you're in it hoping for a short squeeze I think you're blind. 

""Hundred of squeezes in WORLD markets per month"". Lets keep in mind this is one of the most regulated markets WE are in with regards to AMC. 
Show me a squeeze with similar metrics to AMC, and I'll say I'm wrong. But there is nothing. 

So basically we have a lot of risk for a pretty limited upside gain. And the hopes of a SS should not even be mentioned becuase statistically you're prob more likely to win lotto."

I lack that confidence, you seem to have, that they will successfully create an online business that justifies the share price."
2021-04-15 08:31:55,wallstreetbets,"Tesla was not squeezed. Short interest increased over the last year with the stock price increasing. Maybe there may have been a few short periods were people had to force cover before new shorts came in, but that does not explain the price.

GME on the other hand saw a massive reduction in short interest and accordingly, even without any squeeze, the equilibrium price for it would increase due to reduced supply. Pretty simple, short interest goes up it means more supply of the stock, hence the stock price should go lower and vice versa.

As to comparing GME and AMC in terms of value. I went through this in some other comments already so will not repeat myself, but suffice the two companies have many significant differences."

2021-04-15 17:24:48,wallstreetbets,"well, buying coin the only way shell get any is running people over for them"
2021-04-15 18:58:10,wallstreetbets,there are some people's mama that WOULD do that though.
2021-04-15 11:28:00,wallstreetbets,"That is a hilarious burn -- ya got me thinking, isn't this exactly the kind of innovation Coinbase opens up? It seems like it would be really straightforward to use the combination of fractional shares and being able to reference the ledger to make totally verifiable artificial nano ETFs so that apes could gain instant exposure to fellow apes bets (I say artificial because the way I'm imagining it there would be no starting pool of shares to sell off, rather they would be created as a result of a widget that purchases fractional shares on behalf of followers to maintain parity with the referenced portfolio...

So. Lets do this. Lets start doing puts on each other's portfolios."

2021-04-15 09:46:59,wallstreetbets,I'm not sure if you're talking about the preferred price rating given by Nasdaq but the stock opened at $381. The brokerages listed it's % change based off the $250 preferred price but since it was never available at that price the stock actually lost money from the opening and is still $41 down.
2021-04-15 03:11:44,wallstreetbets,Anyone who gets a company before IPO is finessing people buying the IPO on the open market.
2021-04-15 07:29:57,wallstreetbets,"Based on a business model that is purely speculative with no federal adoption and/or governance? 

If the crypto market collapses, care to work out those numbers? Or let‚Äôs base the simple math off the previous collapse of the crypto market.

I bet on companies that are tried and true, not speculative companies early in the adoption phase with no proven business model in real world application.

Also... look at CRCT, they doubled their revenue in a single year in a continuing growing market yet their IPO crashed. I‚Äôm not buying it and it‚Äôs alright to have different option. What do I know? I‚Äôm only 8.5 years into my crypto journey."

2021-04-15 02:34:32,wallstreetbets,"These are all concerns but it really seems that $COIN is priced for mediocrity, so you get all the upside for free. Even if $COIN profits drop to $350M per quarter the rest of the year, it will still have a p/e of 50. Very reasonable. Coinbase is going to have $750M profit quarters every now and then off of sheer volatility alone, so I‚Äôm not too concerned if profits drop every now and then. The bull case however is
1) they grow (not a far stretch since they grew 700% yoy
2) they get into online and in person payments. It‚Äôd be awesome if you could pay your groceries by pulling out your Coinbase wallet. (I understand there are transaction time and volatility issues with c0rn)
3) c0rn goes to $100+
4) they get into other fintech stuff"

2021-04-15 10:29:38,wallstreetbets,Pretty dumb take. They won't make as much money on a bear market. And once that's over they will make even less.

2021-04-15 10:37:56,wallstreetbets,It's a hedge against inflation.   There is a reason more institutions have started buying in.   If these numbers you see floating around about 40% of all us currency being printed in the last year are true its very possible we are about to be in a big ol heep of shit.
2021-04-15 10:39:53,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs not a hedge against inflation... go check the correlation between Crypto/USD/Gold... the thought of it being a hedge is wrong. I initially thought this and was taught a very good lesson.

Yes we are headed to inflation... that I won‚Äôt argue. The numbers I saw were 27% of our entire currency. Politics aside... economics don‚Äôt lie and I‚Äôll agree there."
2021-04-15 10:49:45,wallstreetbets,"I personally hate crypto and think it's goofy as fuck,  maybe it's not a hedge though it appears on the surface the primary use of the only one that really matters,  the big boy on the block is a store of value,  idk,  it's a really really hard market to speculate about,  high risk,  high reward if you play it right buy I stay away from it because no matter how many times I have had it explained to me I still don't understand why its value is what it is and I don't really invest in things I don't understand or know."

2021-04-15 11:03:41,wallstreetbets,You and I both... can't just print money and expect no repercussions. We ALL will be paying for it in the end.
2021-04-15 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$COIN = MOON POTENTIAL Have been seeing a lot of negativity around Coinbase so wanted to provide an echo chamber for us bulls who FOMO'd in near the open.

First off, Coinbase should not be valued as an exchange, it makes no sense to compare it to Nasdaq or NYSE. COIN is rapidly growing, has a vastly different transaction structure, and is beginning to expand into the services market.

Now let's get into some numbers. 2020 Revenue was 1.28 B which is 140% growth over 2019, that is ridiculous. The really crazy number, 1.8 B in revenue for Q1 2021. They had 50% more revenue in Q1 2021 than the entirety of 2020. Let that sink in for a minute. Net Income for Q1 2021 was also around 750 M. If they were to sustain this net income for the rest of the year, that would put them at a 28 P/E ratio... for a company growing this quick? It's important to keep in mind that this was a record quarter for COIN and likely not sustainable near term but it still shows what they are capable of. 

Additionally, they announced that they are up to 56 million users with 6.1 of those being Monthly Transacting Users (MTUs) in Q1 2021. This is a massive jump over the previous quarter and COIN explains that the rise in MTUs is largely due to the increase in price and volatility around virtual currencies. For some reference, Robinhood has 13 million monthly users but get nowhere near the revenue per user that COIN does. These ""virtual currencies"" have continued increasing so far in Q2 2021 so I am expecting another knockout quarter in both revenue and MTUs. Expect the Q2 earnings report to blow past expectations (think massive tendie spike).

Speaking of those beefy transaction fees that COIN gets, there's no way that's sustainable right? It's going to be a race to the bottom, just like the stock trading fees? Well, not exactly. Investors love how simple Coinbase makes trading and are willing to pay a small premium for this ease of use. Currently, fees are massive percentagewise for small trades but become pretty reasonable at a large scale. I could see them lowering rates significantly for these small trades once they build up some more consistent institutional trading revenue and service revenue. 

There's probably some reason to worry about declining margins in the transaction side of the business, however, that's not why COIN deserves to hit $500+. Coinbase's services platform is massively undervalued and is something the mainstream media largely ignores. This segment of the business is growing very quickly and should not be overlooked. If you look at what Cathie Wood says about digital wallets, it should be clear how much potential Coinbase has to monetize it's users. It's creating an entire financial ecosystem built around Coinbase that's designed to keep users around. 

Position: Shares of $COIN

Price Targets: $550 by EOY, $800 by end of 2022"
2021-04-15 00:59:47,wallstreetbets,">$COIN = MOON POTENTIAL

It's going to tank hard, isn't it."
2021-04-14 23:19:17,wallstreetbets,I too am bullish on Coin. I trade/buy crypto and use coinbase pro all the time. I see it as the Tesla of crypto. It's clearly the leader for an exchange. I use others as well but coinbase leads the pack for sure. Bought a couple today @395. I could be fucked but I do think it will be a valuable stock. The FD's are pretty great. Thx for the post! If it dips I'll buy more.
2021-04-15 09:40:14,wallstreetbets,"Regardless of how I feel about $COIN, I'm expecting to see a trend towards the higher highs by the end of this week. Moreover, I think it's going to be huge in the long haul."
2021-04-15 10:39:32,wallstreetbets,The endless stream of 100 share sell offs from employees is why people got butcher yesterday (it's still happening today). It won't last though.
2021-04-14 22:54:23,wallstreetbets,$COIN will be irrelevant when crypto is 100% mainstream and it's integrated into every other trading platform. Would you rather trade crypto on Coinbase or trade everything on some other platform?

Which is where I'd enter if it happens. Right now it might be rewarding... but there's a little too much risk to the reward for my tastes."
2021-04-14 22:38:21,wallstreetbets,"The only negative comments I've read (I'm off work today, have no life other than watching stonks otherwise) is that they released at ~400 despite the 250 estimate.

Do you have any sort of a
evidence or research outside of the anti-FOMO? Can you provide any link to reports of said evidence?

I would be amazed by even one piece of support aside from the ""Employees got paid bonuses with some stock"" argument


Also, prove a position or BAN"
2021-04-14 22:41:29,wallstreetbets,I buy what I can afford to throw out the window. No interest in coin
2021-04-15 00:28:13,wallstreetbets,if coinbase isn't going to get regulated out of existence then kraken will also ipo down the road.  probably much better risk / reward on that play.
2021-04-15 01:01:02,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôll buy leaps when they are ready
2021-04-15 04:32:12,wallstreetbets,Why don‚Äôt you just buy crypto? lol

2021-04-15 00:28:24,wallstreetbets,I was in at opening too.
2021-04-15 09:16:02,wallstreetbets,Have you realized the volume of trading across all the sectors are decresing month by month after the pandemic high ? By this rate I predict the revenew of COIN will cut to half by next 2 quarter. Mark my work .
2021-04-15 00:51:16,wallstreetbets,You have to keep in mind that crypto is in a big big bullrun atm like in 2017... it probably will have their up and downs a lot
2021-04-14 23:12:29,wallstreetbets,I know most of Coinbase's profit comes from their exchange and fees they get from routing transactions through their system. I can't go further into  the ecoins per subreddits rule. What Coinbase's offers on their service is what dictates the type of users who sign up for the service. Only 53 ecoins they have.
2021-04-15 00:28:23,wallstreetbets,Thier success all depends on the value of crypto. Massive regulation could derail.
2021-04-15 08:39:10,wallstreetbets,"My feeling is that the reference price was set there for a reason, the run up felt too hyped.  I‚Äôm leaving my reference price limit order where it‚Äôs at"
2021-04-15 18:36:07,wallstreetbets,"96% of it's revenue is solely from transaction fees, plus custodial baked in. That said, I am YOLOIng this mofo right heeeere!!!!"
2021-04-15 08:28:59,wallstreetbets,Yes.. That was always the plan.
2021-04-14 23:24:41,wallstreetbets,Always happy to provide an echo chamber. Now we just have to hope that we are right.
2021-04-15 08:29:44,wallstreetbets,whats the difference between coinbase and coinbase pro? extra feature?
2021-04-15 01:32:50,wallstreetbets,Ever heard of Kraken?
2021-04-15 06:41:52,wallstreetbets,The tesla of crypto? How does it make sense
2021-04-14 23:00:04,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I think that's a pretty fair critique. I've got two arguments against that, if crypto is 100% mainstream, then you can use your Coinbase account like a savings account, no need for stocks in your savings/checking account. Also, for example, if you buy crypto on Robinhood, you don't actually get access to the underlying coin, so it's not integrated quite yet."
2021-04-14 23:13:42,wallstreetbets,"Bro you think coin doesn't own any crypto? If crypto goes mainstream coin will get fat with even bigger commissions.
Also imo crypto can go mainstream until the boomers die

Edit: n't. (Can't)"
2021-04-15 05:31:23,wallstreetbets,"This is my take - there will be lots of new players entering the market.

Paypal is going live soon."

2021-04-14 22:45:45,wallstreetbets,Took 3 months to get a reply the other day which was just an acknowledgment of me sending them a message and then asking me again what the issue was. I honestly had forgot I even sent it as I had to troubleshoot myself and figure it out.
2021-04-15 00:19:24,wallstreetbets,Legit went to do my taxes and some of my transactions from last year were just gone poof. Depending on which statement I looked up I found some not all like month of November statement had them but not in the statement the whole of 2020. This is pretty important tax time and made it awful. Support didn‚Äôt respond until 3 weeks later with how to check you statement for ffs
2021-04-15 00:22:06,wallstreetbets,Seconded. I've genuinely never been less impressed with any companies cx that I've ever interacted with. Kinda hammers home the fact that coinbase solely exists as an on-ramp to other unbanked exchanges that actually let you do fun shit lol.
2021-04-14 22:44:53,wallstreetbets,"Hmm, I haven't had any issues with their customer service but that's good to know. It's hard to trust companies long term that don't have good customer service."
2021-04-15 03:36:06,wallstreetbets,Cathie Woods bought $COIN.
2021-04-14 22:43:54,wallstreetbets,I mean they were trading at \~350 in the private market right before the IPO so the initial price really wasn't surprising at all. Essentially all numbers I got in my post are from SEC website.

They have good services and it‚Äôs all a hell of a lot more trustworthy than some Chinese platform registered in St Kitts or whatever."
2021-04-15 02:23:56,wallstreetbets,It won't get there again

2021-04-14 23:50:35,wallstreetbets,Is 400 covered calls bearish?  Seems like a calculated bull move.  How do you play this bullish?
2021-04-14 22:55:00,wallstreetbets,"Fair enough. 

I would exercise regardless of Theta; it has the same cost against your calls either way....

If you sell vs Theta, you make a buck

If you exercise, Theta doesn't matter any more, and we all make 2 bucks.

You'd be surprised at how much price movement is generated at your diamond balls level of interest"
2021-04-15 03:53:16,wallstreetbets,">Not sure if they'd be in the money by tomorrow. My calls are long dated calls expiring next year. Didn't want to pay the higher IV premium on the short dated calls.

2021-04-14 21:55:46,wallstreetbets,I know I was talking about the puts. But he says when or if he gets paid on them he‚Äôll buy more
2021-04-14 23:29:39,wallstreetbets,Oh - they are covered call options - I didn‚Äôt see that!
2021-04-15 00:37:42,wallstreetbets,I guess so
2021-04-15 02:48:11,wallstreetbets,"To reply to your original question:

You've spent more than 100 shares cost for the permission to buy shares at a higher price than now, less than a year from now.

I think it's smarter to buy 100 shares and sell covered calls against it. I'm not expecting rockets, just swings, so high short term IV.

I guess with what you have, what could do is sell $200 calls against your position and if/when GME gets that high just roll them up and out a week to like 220, then 240, etc until the time cost isn't worth it or they expire worthless.

I kept rolling a 110 call for a credit to 240 over a month so I'm sure you can keep doing that here as well."
2021-04-15 13:55:00,wallstreetbets,"Sweet thank you for the assistance, I will save it on a playlist; give it a little listen


I‚Äôll just be honest though I feel like the jokes of everyone being retarded hits home with me. Left handed, addhd, like pictures, I prefer colored pencils but that‚Äôs because my mom said I‚Äôm special."
2021-04-14 22:06:19,wallstreetbets,im sticking with the shares.  the premiums on the options are too wide in my retarded opinion.
2021-04-15 00:00:15,wallstreetbets,"Someone wanted to make a bet that GME would fall below 100 and 40 by those 2 expiry dates. I took the other side of those bets and collected a premium for it. If GME doesn't fall below 100, I get to keep the premiums on both puts.

I risk 14,000 because I'd have to buy 200 shares of GME if it falls below 40. 100 shares @ $40/share and 100 shares @ $100/share. 

Hope that helps."
2021-04-15 00:00:09,wallstreetbets,"I mean if the stock goes above $400 you lose money so it is by definition bearish on the stock. You're hoping it moves sideways or goes up to like $399 and then expires worthless, not that it explodes to $1,000 and you get fucked.

A bullish play is buying calls or selling puts. Bearish is buying puts or selling calls."
2021-04-15 00:39:24,wallstreetbets,Literally selling any calls is bearish. Think about it.
2021-04-15 00:33:18,wallstreetbets,"Many people try to skirt the line and collect the premium with strikes closer to the underlying. The goal is to never get called away, and instead collect the premium."
2021-04-15 00:37:33,wallstreetbets,"Its a bear move right now for a couple of reasons. The first, he's anticipating the price will never reach 400. Two, if a market maker sells a call, they hedge it by  buying delta \* number of call contracts \* 100 = number of shares of GME. Therefore, when retail sells covered calls, they're undercutting the gamma squeeze."
2021-04-14 23:04:08,wallstreetbets,"That makes a lot of sense. Exercise calls that are in the money. 

When you say ""how much price movement generated"", that makes sense with how little shares outstanding there are. Is there a quantifiable way to measure price sensitivity aside from stock beta? 

Anyway, let's see what happens tomorrow and Friday."
2021-04-15 14:04:58,wallstreetbets,he sold the puts & the weeklies are sells of covered calls
2021-04-15 03:10:28,wallstreetbets,Ya guess I could do that. I dunno. I was just trying to kinda copy DFV with long dated calls. That's as complex as a strategy my retard smooth brain can handle.
2021-04-15 02:07:12,wallstreetbets,"That's why you would sell puts......to capitalize on the massively inflated premiums. Assuming you were confident that GME would not go down and stay down.  This is not financial advice, i believe GME is doomed to fall, i would advise against selling puts."
2021-04-15 00:20:07,wallstreetbets,So you get paid in advance to buy stocks you‚Äôd want to buy anyways!?!
2021-04-15 03:27:03,wallstreetbets,"Sound like a method I used to use in roulette. I would do a couple of side bets for example $100 each on 1 -13 & 14 - 24. Each spot would pay 3√ó, so if it hit anything 1 - 24 I would lose a 100, but win 200 plus my 100 back. The odd's were on my side because I covered a lot of territory on the table... but there was always that risk I could get a bad streak and land on 0 or 25 and above and lose all $300. This is how I can comprehend what's happening here, but it's still a little sophisticated for my skill-set."
2021-04-15 06:19:13,wallstreetbets,"Did you write all the calls/putts in this screenshot? Im learning option trading, and wonder, as a buyer you have the right to excersise at the strike price, as a seller of the option contracts, you have to wait till expiration always?"
2021-04-15 00:05:07,wallstreetbets,Ok you lose opportunity but you could buy the call back?  I don‚Äôt see how you lose money?
2021-04-15 00:45:24,wallstreetbets,"Short term bear, long term Bull, all markets with a chain ;)"

2021-04-15 06:18:30,wallstreetbets,For the love of god don‚Äôt exercise an option with 9 months to expiration.  Look at how much extrinsic value is left in them.  You‚Äôd lose all of that.
2021-04-15 00:31:43,wallstreetbets,It's called a cash secured put.

2021-04-15 05:24:12,wallstreetbets,welcome to r/thetagang
2021-04-15 06:13:59,wallstreetbets,Yeah basically the way I see it is if you want to own stock you should sell puts and collect premium until the price falls and you can own it. If you want to sell a stock pick your PT and sell covered calls and if it rises to that price you get to sell your stock if not you collect premium until you can.
2021-04-15 08:59:21,wallstreetbets,The odds were never on your side in roulette
2021-04-15 11:41:09,wallstreetbets,"Haha I use this same technique on roulette. Black, then pick a third of the board then a few splits or corners in the 3rd of the board I bet. Last trip to Vegas was completely paid for and then some doing that for 3 days"
2021-04-15 11:09:56,wallstreetbets,"  
Skill set? You were making a bet with a negative expected value (-EV)

And none of your numbers add up btw.   
and no. The odds were not on your side. Lol!"
2021-04-15 06:30:33,wallstreetbets,"Row 2, 3, 4, 5, I wrote calls and puts. The bottom 3 calls, I bought.

As a call buyer, I'm buying the right to buy at my chosen strike price at a future date.

As a put writer, I'm obligating myself to buy shares if the stock falls below the put's strike price."
2021-04-15 00:09:53,wallstreetbets,You'd be buying it back at a major loss if it went in the money due to the underlying stock increasing in value.
2021-04-15 15:33:15,wallstreetbets,"You dont lose money if you bought the stock at 200 and sold at 400 but now its at 800.  You miss out on the value of the 400+premium-800 move but you dont LOSE money.  If youve been selling those calls for weeks you might actually be selling for ~450 in reality instead of 400.  

To call that bearish is a hell of a stretch"
2021-04-14 23:14:15,wallstreetbets,Thank you kind sir!
2021-04-15 08:06:11,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I don‚Äôt know what the other guy is playing at, if you want the shares, buy the shares at market and sell the calls to reduce the cost basis cashing in on extrinsic."
2021-04-15 01:38:44,wallstreetbets,"I don‚Äôt know what any of this means but I bought my first couple calls today. Finally venturing in just getting my feet wet. 

I feel like forest gump when he meets Nixon. Don‚Äôt even know why I‚Äôm posting this, oh yeah I remember. I like the call and put thing; I had similar ideas and I bet you‚Äôre doing the finer tuned version"
2021-04-15 07:56:48,wallstreetbets,"Great if you can afford to buy shares in 100 lots.

For GME that can be a bit cost prohibitive."
2021-04-15 11:58:27,wallstreetbets,"Thank you, finally some one that gets it : )"
2021-04-15 06:37:07,wallstreetbets,"Awesome thanks, nice hand then btw dude! How do I spot those lower 3, i guess that‚Äôs based on the profit those contracts have got you so far? Last last question(s), bottom 3 have a lot of time left, 2 are in the strike.. the seller of those contracts dont need to buy 100 shares at (hypothetically) 400 if you would wait to exercise at that price right? You only exercise the strikeprice?"
2021-04-15 01:01:07,wallstreetbets,"I've been doing much the same as OP, yeah but that's why you watch it daily, a few days to execute if it looks like things are getting closer to itm or if there's a rumor that could act as a catalyst that I think could hit my strike price I either roll to a later date or buy to close, I've built up 100 shares of GME and 1200 amc pretty much on house money at this point by selling cash covered puts and covered calls weekly.  Biggest threat to me is if starts climbing and couldn't get out of my call I'd have to just leave it and buy 100 more shares, not like I'd lose money, it's still way more than I bought them for, could just use my margin to get more back while waiting for the sale to clear."
2021-04-15 01:57:25,wallstreetbets,"Do you understand what buying a call implies? Just to touch up on it.

You have the right, but not the obligation, to buy 100 shares of a stock at a strike price and a date  that you chose. You pay a premium for that right. Remember! You think the stock is going up!

Now consider who SOLD that option.

Me. I sold you the right to buy 100 shares (that I own) of the stock. You pay me a price to have the right to buy those shares if the stock reaches that strike price before the expiry. Now this is BEARISH BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THE PRICE WILL GET THERE. I just want to collect that premium and ultimately keep my shares when your contract expires worthless (cause it didn't get to the strike of your choosing).

There are some scenarios where you want to have your shares called away for the premium, but those are pretty few.

Tell me what else you need, I'll be happy to help."
2021-04-15 07:27:52,wallstreetbets,"What expiration? Biggest mistake new option buyers make is not understanding theta decay and getting IV crushed, even if the stock is moving in the direction you want."
2021-04-15 06:45:42,wallstreetbets,"Are you referring to the 350 call and 400 call when you say ""2 are in the strike""? I'm the one who sold those 350 and 400 calls. So I would be the one who has to sell my shares to the buyers of the 350 and 400 calls if GME ends up above 400 end of week."
2021-04-15 01:15:32,wallstreetbets,"Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I write covered calls all the time. Lots of good reasons to do so. It‚Äôs still by definition a bearish position."
2021-04-15 07:00:53,wallstreetbets,Can you explain why you would want your shares to get called away?
2021-04-15 13:17:02,wallstreetbets,"Yo thank you so much, this is awesome.   I thought it was funny because I was trying to explain to the Mrs. about how I saw green earlier and she was looking up the call and the price is more pricey now.   Is she buying that call from me or she buying that call from the same person I bought it from i.e. you

EDIt: This is pretty cool though because when I did a quick check this moring it seems like I could have sold all my calls, they had ""buys"" and I would have pulled a quick couple 100.

\- My question is that I did this on Robinhood for the ease of access and pretty pictures, when I was looking at selling it had mentioned a different word then money.   It almost sounded like I was selling it for like gift card not cash.   maybe it just said credit.

\-I vaguely remember reading about call/put fees.  Is this something that I'm going to need to factor into cost average?

\-Once again mush love and thanks so much.   If you ever want any mushroom spores for ""microscopy use only"" hit me up man!"
2021-04-15 07:54:51,wallstreetbets,"I sold 7 shares of GME and bought 12 options. Sold some yesterday abd bought 9 shares back, plus still have half of my options left. Second time doing options isnt too bad!"
2021-04-15 13:01:34,wallstreetbets,"Finally, do you want to explains to me with pictures The Greeks, don't understand that at all and what's with being able to sell before the call date.

Also I'd have the option of Exercise and choose to buy the contracts.

I'll be smart and do my own homework, but I always need to get a first hand talk with someone.  Usually they make better pictures for my mind"
2021-04-15 10:36:52,wallstreetbets,"Im sorry, I meant the 150/170 calls, they are what they call ‚Äúin the money‚Äù currently? (I mistakenly used in the strike price)

Would the person who is on the sellside of those bets hypothetically speaking need to buy the 100 shares at 400 a piece if you would wait untill the price moved into that zone before expiration?

Edit; the 150 currently only.. wasnt paying attention to the value today, thought it was above 170 still"
2021-04-15 01:39:52,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, true, it's just one of those things where the definition doesn't really work well with how high the IV is, with high IV you can sell deep OTM pretty safely and still make good money, and you hold the shares in margin so if the price does start to skyrocket you can quickly buy duplicate shares.  I don't have any covered calls open this week personally for gme, only been selling them when it looks like I can get a good price and there should be a good dip coming soon."
2021-04-15 08:42:30,wallstreetbets,"Isn't it a neutral position? You don't actually want the stock to go down, just trade sideways. Your overall delta is still positive, since it's 100 (for the 100 shares) - (short call delta x 100). If the underlying tanks hardcore, you lose money overall on the position since you lose on the underlying, and now if you want to sell CCs and be profitable you will need to either sell them FAR OTM or sell them below your cost basis for the underlying (which is a losing position)."
2021-04-15 08:56:48,wallstreetbets,"Say you sell a cash secured put, and you end up getting assigned the shares (Oops!). Maybe you're not really stoked about owning that specific company, and you want to sell those shares. But you want to make some extra cash, so you sell a covered call slightly out of the money in hopes they get called away cause you never wanted them in the first place."
2021-04-15 12:39:13,wallstreetbets,"Say you own MSFT and want to sell some. You think the current price is a good deal. Do you sell at market? Do you set a limit for $260? 
Or maybe you sell a call for 260 strike. Now you still sell @ 260 but you also collect $80 for selling the call. You've essentially sold at $260.8 even if the price never went above 260.01."
2021-04-15 13:30:06,wallstreetbets,"The cost of your contract is determined mostly by IV (implied volatility). Volatility is just that, a measurement of how much the stock moves up and down. When IV is higher, contract cost is higher because there is a greater change of the stock moving either way towards strike prices.

Stocks that have low IV are usually stocks that don't move a lot.

This is why GME IV is quite high (actually low right now but I digress), because GME has moved a TON lately."
2021-04-15 14:17:01,wallstreetbets,Nicceee
2021-04-15 10:51:00,wallstreetbets,"If the sellers of those 150, 170 calls don't have 200 shares handy at the time I exercise my right to buy them, and the price of the stock on the open market is 400+ a piece, then yes they'll have to pay 400+ or whatever price GME is selling for on the open market to deliver my 200 shares."
2021-04-15 11:30:55,wallstreetbets,It's not a neutral position because you are betting against the stock going up.
2021-04-15 09:36:49,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the explanation!

So it's basically a way to earn a little more on ""selling"" a stock you don't want."
2021-04-15 14:18:11,wallstreetbets,I went retard and bought 60 contracts expiring tomorrow. Gonna commit.
2021-04-15 14:33:52,wallstreetbets,"You're really not. You own stock. Your delta is not negative. If you sold naked or uncovered calls then yeah, that's bearish. 

If you own a pile of 100 shares, your delta is 1 (or 100 depending on how you count it). If you sell a covered call against those shares, let's say the call has a delta of 0.3, your new delta is 0.7. You capped your gains and collected premium; the best thing for you is if it just trades sideways. If the stock tanks straight into the earth's core, you lose money overall on the position. 


If you then sell covered calls against your now cheaper shares and they're called away for a lower strike than what you bought them for, you realize a loss on those shares (assuming what you collected in premium doesn't make up for what you lose on those shares)."
2021-04-15 10:15:22,wallstreetbets,"You're welcome, and yes. Mind you I've only explained the positive sides of these trades. There are also the negative sides, which aren't pretty. Glad I could help!"

2021-04-15 02:31:40,wallstreetbets,"For the QQQ trades :  
1. S/He was already holding 400 QQQ shares (which was bought at a LOWER price than $336)  
2. S/He then SOLD 4 Put Option contracts at an expiry date of April 16 for a sell price of $336  
3. By virtue of SELLING Options, s/he RECEIVED money!   
4. Price of the Put option was hit - so s/he was FORCED to sell the shares at $336 - luckily, s/he ALREADY had 400 QQQ shares before selling the PUT options so the broker will just automatically sell the shares at $336 - if s/he DIDN'T have shares, the broker will BUY the shares at market price and sell immediately at $336 - in this case, looks like it doesn't matter as the share price closed pretty much at the option strike price - but imagine if the share price went down to $200 - the broker would BUY at $200 and SELL at $336!  
5. S/he collected the following tendies:  
Premium from SELLING the put options +  
Profit from selling shares at $336

For the SQ trades:  
1. Again, s/he was already holding some SQ shares  
2. Sold 15 put options at a strike price of 250  
3. Sold 300 shares of SQ at $259.35  
4. BOUGHT 30 contracts of Put options at strike price of 260 expiry date of 7-May  
5. The following tendies were made :  
Premium for selling put options +  
Profit from selling 300 shares -  
Premiums paid for 30 put options   
6. Looks like s/he is still holding on to the 30 put options as they are in the money (strike price is greater than market price) - if s/he sells now, will make more tendies - if s/he holds, will make or lose tendies depending if share price goes up or down (s/he is hoping it goes down below $260"

So I would like to start by saying that this thread was born as a reply to a user but, since it has become quite long and I think that some users might like to read it, I thought to post it directly. The discussion comes from a user who sends me 2 links, respectively

Black Rock Fund Advisor [https://www.sec.gov/edgar/browse/?CIK=0001006249](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/browse/?CIK=0001006249)

I answered pragmatically indicating 2 links of response (I know I was wrong to paste only 2 links without explaining why but I thought that those who understood my post, would understand immediately)

&#x200B;

Well now let's read the comment that disputes my thread:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wtzq228jw7t61.png?width=858&format=png&auto=webp&s=b4208ab78e36d1541bb5585b0b96311bd65aa001

1 - ""You directly linked to a position of BR-FA ownership in GME, and now it is useless? Come on dude, do better""

The reason I pasted the 2 links, as a response to the post was to show that there are no updated positions as of 3/31/2021 from Black Rock Fund Advisors. There are no updates since 2017!

&#x200B;

2- ""That 13F-HR is the most recent holdings report. Can you show me where BR-FA sold?""

This is where it gets interesting. You can see that just after that date of the most recent 13F-HR (Filed 2017-02-10), Black Rock Fund Advisors has not submitted any more 13F-HR forms to note their positions. You can check it out for yourself:

[https://www.sec.gov/edgar/search/?r=el#/dateRange=custom&ciks=0001006249&entityName=BlackRock%2520Fund%2520Advisors%2520(CIK%25200001006249)&startdt=2016-02-01&enddt=2020-02-01](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/search/?r=el#/dateRange=custom&ciks=0001006249&entityName=BlackRock%2520Fund%2520Advisors%2520(CIK%25200001006249)&startdt=2016-02-01&enddt=2020-02-01)

In lieu of submitting the 13F-HR, Black Rock Fund Advisor has begun submitting a 13F-NT form. What's different? Just open the Form to find out:

[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1006249/000108636417000052/xslForm13F\_X01/primary\_doc.xml](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1006249/000108636417000052/xslForm13F_X01/primary_doc.xml)

You can tell right away what is written there:

13F NOTICE. (Check here if no holdings reported are in this report, and all holdings are reported by other reporting manager(s).)

and

List of Other Managers Reporting for this Manager:

If there are no entries in this list, omit this section.

    	Form 13F File Number Name
    
    028-12019 BlackRock Inc.

&#x200B;

Look who is taking all the trouble to post the positions of their subsidiaries, but it is BLACK ROCK INC!!!!!!!

With this 13F- NT Black Rock Fund Advisor is basically saying: from today on, my daddy Black Rock Inc will take charge of everything I have!

From here on Black Rock Fund Advisor presented only 13F-NT form (and bought only 4-5 stocks to date).

But let's see what was happening to Black Rock Inc in the meantime....

These are the positions of BlackRock Inc on 2017-02-10 taken from 13F-HR:

&#x200B;

What do you notice? Black Rock Inc had very few GME shares.

&#x200B;

But let's analyze the next 13F-HR submitted by Black Rock Inc on 2017-05-12:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/j8wprt8kx7t61.png?width=1149&format=png&auto=webp&s=9582010b2ef6a34535c4180c3019a183a3257b01

But it's magic!!!! Black Rock Inc owns as many as 14 positions!!! But how is that possible!!!! Oh my god!!! Burn the witch!!!!

But let's analyze the front page of this Form 13F-HR from 2017-05-12:

Source: [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1364742/000108636417000069/xslForm13F\_X01/primary\_doc.xml](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1364742/000108636417000069/xslForm13F_X01/primary_doc.xml)

&#x200B;

Let's analyze the most important passages:

13F COMBINATION REPORT. (Check here if a portion of the holdings for this reporting manager are reported in this report and a portion are reported by other reporting manager(s).)

and

Provide a numbered list of the name(s) and Form 13F file number(s) of all institutional investment managers with respect to which this report is filed, other than the manager filing this report.

If there are no entries in this list, state ""NONE"" and omit the column headings and list entries.

[Look who is on the list, but it is indeed BLACK ROCK FUND ADVISOR!!!](https://preview.redd.it/4a8h3z6nx7t61.png?width=1408&format=png&auto=webp&s=7c29fb4eb43a2117bd7732eed42c953b2f764285)

&#x200B;

With that I have shown you how from 2017-05-12 onwards Black Rock Inc has taken over the position of all their subsidiaries. The evolutions of those GME positions over time you can check for yourself.

Also check out opening Black Rock Inc's position on the bloomberg terminal what comes up:

&#x200B;

Let's come to the other point made by the user

""Also, in your Fidelity sale filing, pay attention to section 7. They moved the securities to another company.

""Item 7. Identification and Classification of the Subsidiary Which Acquired the Security Being Reported on By the Parent Holding Company.

See attached Exhibit A.""

Here he is referring to an old post that came out at the time of the Fidelity GME sale posted on the GME forum. I have already replied to this kind of comment and I paste one of my answers:

I've already been shown the thread you mean ( you can find it in the comments on my post on s u p e r s t o n k ). The author of the post is simply wrong because:

&#x200B;

1 - There is no reference whatsoever to a transfer of shares

2- But let's say for sure that the author is right, where is the new SEC filing? Why on bloomberg terminal has disappeared fidelity from January 29 onwards?

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/i0dkml8u1qt61.png?width=1918&format=png&auto=webp&s=ef36a26be1aa1cc524a8d18f2e530ab66a323a45

3- If there had been a real transfer there would be SEC filings with different C    I      K's

4- For those who want to believe the fairy tale of the transfer of ownership through ITEM 7 I just say go check out the other 13Gs

EXAMPLE:

[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0000315066/000031506619001099/filing.txt](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0000315066/000031506619001099/filing.txt)

I took 2 at random, they all have the fucking wording : ""

Item 7. Identification and Classification of the Subsidiary Which

Acquired the Security Being Reported on By the Parent Holding Company.

"" and

""Exhibit A

Pursuant to the instructions in Item 7 of Schedule 13G,

the following table lists the identity and Item 3 classification, if

applicable, of each relevant entity that beneficially owns shares of the

security class being reported on this Schedule 13G.""

Opening every 13G there is this wording, following the reasoning Fidelity likes to pass shares in every fucking 13G xD.

&#x200B;

I would like to add that after reading what I have written here, it should be clearer why Fidelity has SOLD and not moved shares.

&#x200B;

I want to conclude by saying that after posting my GME counter DD, I received many positive comments that understood what I was talking about but also many others that did not understand. It's okay to not understand some things, I didn't understand them when I started either. But I get annoyed by those who try to counter what I have written with really meaningless arguments that only show that they have not understood anything about the subject and have little knowledge on the subject. This is why I sometimes respond badly.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

EDIT: since so many people ask for it here is a TLDR

TLDR: Fidelity does not own any GME stock, all the positions you see on the finra site ie: Fidelity Management & Research Company LLC, FMR Inc and Fidelity Management and Research Company are an error. Fidelity sold in January.  Instead the position of Black Rock Inc which owns 9,217,335 is confirmed. The other Black Rock Fund Advisors which owns 10m shares is wrong.

There is only 100% shares outstanding. It's really that simple. You can not have more than 100% (or less than, for that matter) owned. All, no more, no less, are held by somebody. Anybody trying to suggest otherwise is just the typical motley fool, ihub, yahoo finance message board stock expert trying to sound like they know what they are talking about. I bet they also think gme is going to recall their shares next week to fix the 192% ownership problem (that isnt even real). Again, companies cannot recall their shares. They can (and do periodically) reconcile exact ownership of all of their shares to determine things like dividend rights, warrant rights, splits, etc. They cannot recall their shares. That is done by brokers who have lent shares to shorts. Gme cannot force brokers to do it. Gme can ask nicely, and brokers and decide whether or not to do it."

- Fidelity ""transferred"" a fuck ton of GME, except nothing confirms transfer, so probably sold, therefore Fidelity doesn't really have much GME.

- When squeeze happens, there's less chance 5M-15M shares of GME will get dumped by BlackRock and Fidelity because, as stated above, they don't have that many shares."

The second link of the that you posted regarding the discussion is totally uninformative because:

1- It takes into account data on the Nasdaq site which is not up to date.

2- It uses this link [https://fundresearch.fidelity.com/mutual-funds/composition/316345305](https://fundresearch.fidelity.com/mutual-funds/composition/316345305)

which takes morningstar data!!! the ones I made 2 whole posts about to say they are wrong.

&#x200B;

By the way this user also unknowingly proved that Fidelity sold...through SEC Filings.

&#x200B;

I repeat for the millionth time: If Fidelity had not sold, where are the SEC Filings showing ownership of these shares? Did the shares after the Fabulous handoff go into a black hole and disappear? (Or is it more logical that they were sold?) Why is there no mention of Fidelity on the Bllomberg Terminal among the institutions that own GME? These are very stupid questions that have only one logical answer (and it should be after I've written 2 entire posts on the reason why)"

In other words, if things are poppin off and both BlackRock and Fidelity have far fewer shares than we thought they did, there's that much less of a chance they'll cash out massive positions during the squeeze which means more shares are in the hands of Apes than previously thought.

In other *OTHER* words, ape really do set the price.

2021-04-15 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$COIN: $150B ($570/share) Price Target TLDR:

* $COIN collects revenue on trading USD VOLUME not asset prices. More trading, buying, *and* selling = more revenue
* Each cycle has introduced a new volume range
* Paypal's and Square's (and Affirm's) valuation indicate the markets are willing to price fintech at large multiples

We can readily compare $COIN against Paypal and Square: they all offer peer-to-peer payment solutions, are involved in the currency space, and offer exchange services. While, PYPL and SQ both offer more established merchant solutions that's not to discredit $COIN's efforts in enabling businesses to accept currency via its 'commerce' service, which could become popular as opinions and usage continue to increase favorably.

$COIN's [Q1 Numbers](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/06/coinbase-reports-estimated-q1-revenue-of-1point8-billion-up-nine-fold.html)

* $1.8 Billion Revenue
* $800 Million Profit
* 56 Million users

Using these numbers, we can approximate the annual numbers:

* $7.2 Billion Annual Revenue
* $3.2 Billion Annual Profit

**This is making 2 quite large assumptions:**

1. Quarterly revenue is not seasonal -- revenues from Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4 are approximately equivalent
2. Revenue is *sustained* \-- revenue is not dependent on asset prices, but rather trading volume. More on this later

# Comparison

^(1) $COIN numbers assuming $340/share

^(2) While a 20.8 PS ratio may seem rich, this would be within reason of Affirm's [25.7 PS Ratio](https://ycharts.com/companies/AFRM/ps_ratio)

# ^ Assuming that revenue streams are sustainable and continue to grow, there's no reason why $COIN can't trade at $150B, when compared to Paypal and Square multiples

# 

# Argument for Sustained Revenue

* **$COIN** collects fees on buying *and* selling. If the assets were to suddenly correct, $COIN will still collect fees on the sell side. **We can make a strong claim that $COIN's revenues are primarily dependent on volume, not asset prices**

* **Despite huge volatile corrections, trading volume has entered new ranges with each cycle.**
* **This observation also applies to other assets**

2021-04-15 05:41:34,wallstreetbets," $COIN collects revenue on trading VOLUME not asset prices. 

Not entirely correct - they collect revenue on trading VALUE so they do require crypto high.  There is a reason they only started being seriously profitable last year."
2021-04-15 11:15:33,wallstreetbets,"> $COIN collects revenue on trading VOLUME not asset prices. More trading, buying, and selling = more revenue

This is NOT TRUE. The fee is a percentage of the value sold. If I sell one coin for 60k, Coinbase makes twice as much as if I sell 1 coin for 30k.

Also, volume decreases with price of the assets. During a crash, the numbers will be fine, but there is typically an extended bear market after a crash, where the numbers will be shit. 

That said, their q2 numbers will be stellar, and I believe volume will be up through q3 even if the crash happens early q3, so q3 numbers should be fine as well (though the price will still probably suffer)

EDIT: Please see this chart for any doubts: 

https://data.bitcoinity.org/markets/price_volume/5y/USD/coinbase?t=lb&vu=curr

Trade volume (in $B) by price. There is a clear correlation between dollar volume and price. Buying $COIN is a bet the bull market for coins is going to continue. It is not independent."

2021-04-14 22:59:19,wallstreetbets,"So we should still be able to see revenue streams even during a bear market, however it might be within a time frame. During the end of each cycle, volume decreases, even after hitting a new floor in the asset. Now that would be for one asset and I believe COIN has about 30 different assets tied to USD and stable coins. With the cycle we are currently in, it is possible that this time around revenue stream could be sustainable and this particular cycle may be different compared to the last two cycles in which the sell offs might be of a lesser degree where the biggest crypto asset in the world might just drop to 50% instead of the 80% the asset is use to during a huge sell off or at the end of a bull cycle.

Tbh, I'm probably going to keep an eye on COIN for a couple of weeks and use it's volume and trend to trade it with volatility, especially when options are available."

2021-04-15 00:30:07,wallstreetbets,"Yeah. It's a *really* big deal. The whole 'programmable money' thing becomes real there. You're not exactly buying a weird piece of money or stock as much as you're buying an actual functional piece of the network they've built.

Smart contracts can enable impossible sounding things- by say, letting strangers collectively loan another stranger $100 million USD in funds to make arbitrage trades with no collateral, no ID, and all parties 100% guaranteed all agreed terms will be met or the contract doesn't execute, and no funds move. Any penalties or exit clauses are written in from the start, and the network itself holds the funds in escrow and disperses according to the terms.

If all contract terms are met, then the contract executes all trades as a single unit, and hundreds of millions can effectively 'teleport' in a single transaction between parties who do not need to trust one another to feel safe entering the contract if they like the terms written in the public code.

That's just one thing they've been used for (that's AAVE's ""Flash Loans"" service- anyone who can come up with a 'good' trade has access to hundreds of millions).

The thing with ETH is that smart contracts must be paid for using the ETH tokens. No ETH, no smart contract executions. They're like cellphone minutes for a weird super computer."

I plan to hold til I die (then pass them in my will), while I use the value as collateral *today* to fund my IRL investments/stuffing my retirement accounts with tax free, crypto-secured cash.

When you sell 'em, you get taxed out the ass. On the other hand, it's tax free to use the rising value as collateral with savings/loan places like /r/Nexo (who pay in-coin interest in the 5%+ range when you're not using the coins as collateral).

$COIN is starting to get into overcollateralized loans fully secured by crypto game too, and that is an *insane* money maker. Nexo has given out over $50 billion in loans in the last 2 years or so (99% of that being this last year). Google 'NexoStatistics' and check out that insane graph. 

I thought it was an error, but it's not. I remember being impressed by their January 2021 numbers of $1.4 billion USDC lent out- but that was *nothing* compared to what's been going on lately."

2021-04-15 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$APHA discount, $TLRY merger soon Hey ladies and gents, consider this post your friendly reminder that the thing we've all been waiting for (the APHA/TLRY merger) is just weeks away. Of course, this is a wendy's, not a financial consultancy, so this is not advice, but APHA's slide as of late is quite contrary to future market expectations with NY legalization and VA speeding things along. Schumer and the Dems have indicated legalization is a priority. Biden will probably(?) sign it.

APHA is at a large discount following this week's slide. (Roughly a 14% discount to be exact.) Consider that an APHA share = .83 TLRY shares and you have a pretty substantial gain to be made if you buy APHA at this price and it converts to TLRY at the current price of $17.40. My crayon-napkin math indicates a gain of about 2-3% using current prices.

On top of that, the combined entity TLRY (following the merger) will be the largest weed company by revenue, meaning they'll likely be able to swallow a lot of market share in the US and EU following U.S. legalization, the EU thing is already ongoing.

APHA as a discounted TLRY share is pretty good right now, especially because they move in parallel with TLRY always being more valuable. From there, seems like a hold on TLRY, which most actual advisors seem to agree with."

If they do some good M&A the share price should go up and so the shorts may have to cover their short positions. This could result in an epic short squeeze!! With good M&A they may gain more market share and can grow to become one of the industry leaders in the long run!

2021-04-14 23:46:39,wallstreetbets,"Buckle up tards. You need to learn about arbitrage.  Someone saying to buy apha because tlry is higher completely misses the point. They could both drop to $5 tomorrow and youd be screwed. To take advantage of the price mismatch you need arbitrage.


Here is how it works.  If apha is going to convert to tlry at 0.83x then 100 shares of apha today will become 83 shares of tlry whenever it goes through. So essentially right now you could say 100apha=83tlry.  But right now the price might not reflect that. What do you do?

Well, if apha is too low you buy apha of course. But tryhardfit, you just said that was dumb. It is! If you dont also sell tlry. You buy 100 shares of apha and sell short 83 shares of tlry. This should result in a net positive cash position if tlry is overpriced and apha is underpriced (sell the expensive one, buy the cheap one). 

When you do the trade you will be left with 100 shares of apha, -83 shares of tlry and some extra cash.


When they merge, the 100 shares of apha become 83 shares of tlry. The 83 shares gets added to your negative 83 shares resulting in net 0 shares. The only thing left over is cash. Boom. You just arbitraged.


Warning, if the deal falls through you could be fucked. See westjet and air canada for a very recent example."

The minute the USA legalizes TLRY is going to open up shop in the USA (so is Canopy the largest Marijuana company in the world right now). They likely even have the office space and manufacturing facilities picked out at this point.

I just can‚Äôt see Marijuana not being international across a NAFTA negotiated boarder when these companies are already positioning for that elsewhere with countries Canada doesn‚Äôt have a Free Trade Agreement with. That‚Äôs like saying Budweiser would never sell beer in Canada (they‚Äôre the number one selling beer in Canada by the way). British Tobacco wouldn‚Äôt have bought a stake in Organigram if they didn‚Äôt think Marijuana was going to be an international thing. HEXO also has a deal with Coors Brewing an American company to produce CBD Drinks, you think they don‚Äôt plan on selling those drinks in the USA? All Tilray or Canopy will do is buyout small American operations to gain access to the USA market, but I doubt that will even be necessary."

Also our beer is better, ergo the transitive property, and so on...."
2021-04-14 20:24:40,wallstreetbets,"I like your strategy very much. If they exercise, you essentially sell shares at 0.95$ each when the current price is 0.90$."
2021-04-14 20:47:49,wallstreetbets,I bought it at $1.60 averaged down to $1.28 I‚Äôm holding 7000 shares don‚Äôt care whatever happens it‚Äôs fun money anyways üòú üöÄ

2021-04-15 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"'COIN' gifted $25,000 in stocks to all 1700 employees ahead of IPO "
2021-04-14 21:15:41,wallstreetbets,When I was looking for jobs out of college I found spots with startups and thought they had a decent product but went with a large company because of the benefits that the startups couldn‚Äôt offer. Been thinking recently that I might of missed out on a big pay day. Went back and looked and most of them are out of business and none of them have ipo‚Äôd.
2021-04-14 20:40:50,wallstreetbets,"I loaned my buddy $500 to buy a pool. He told me he‚Äôd work off the money at my business. Whenever I asked him to work, he said he was busy swimming. 5 months later ha gave me a $50 Harvey‚Äôs gift card and told me that he named his pool after me."
2021-04-14 20:24:35,wallstreetbets,Honestly their employees were probably being given many times that amount in stock options each year as part of their compensation package. The early employees who stuck it out will be sitting on potentially millions of dollars worth of ISOs and NSOs.
2021-04-14 21:40:48,wallstreetbets,"Worked for Zappos when it was bought by Amazon.  Many people, not me unfortunately, received 10-20 (maybe more for upper management) shares in Amazon stock.  It was about $250 a share back then.  Most people sold right away.  10 shares is worth about $31,000 now."
2021-04-14 20:07:07,wallstreetbets,One time I got a nice letter from my boss saying that they are letting me go
2021-04-14 20:00:51,wallstreetbets,"Must suck to be the employees who left because Coinbase doesn‚Äôt get involved in politics.

2021-04-14 20:51:48,wallstreetbets,My boss once gave me two free drink tickets at the company Xmas party.
2021-04-14 23:53:16,wallstreetbets,No they didn‚Äôt. I work for Coinbase. Only seasoned employees. Many new employees quit because of disputes over equity.
2021-04-14 20:39:59,wallstreetbets,I was promoted to customer.
2021-04-14 21:22:50,wallstreetbets,I was given more responsibility (staff shortage) and a temporary 20% salary decrease as a medical professional
2021-04-14 21:01:39,wallstreetbets,One time at christmas my boss declared that there was going to be a drawing for a big cash prize for one employee rather than everyone getting a christmas bonus. It was $5 he thought it was real funny. When he announced a couple months later that he was going out of business but had sold the company. I started clapping and everyone joined in lol. He than cried.
2021-04-15 01:51:25,wallstreetbets,Okay now I really am having flashbacks to the dotcom bubble
2021-04-14 20:26:55,wallstreetbets,I got a 120k bonus once while working at a crypt oh company once. Best day of my life
2021-04-14 21:12:30,wallstreetbets,And they sold it the second the market opened lmao if they were smart.
2021-04-14 20:32:55,wallstreetbets,And after 6 months they're still verifying my passport
2021-04-14 20:53:43,wallstreetbets,I used to get holidays off now I get time and a half.
2021-04-14 21:14:45,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm still hoping I can convince warrens buffet to start serving alpha
2021-04-14 23:07:28,wallstreetbets,it's a big club and you aint invited
2021-04-14 23:20:26,wallstreetbets,Worth over 50 billion USD with only 1700 employees lmfao
2021-04-15 01:25:36,wallstreetbets,In other news 1700 employees get to learn the nuances of AMT.
2021-04-15 02:50:06,wallstreetbets,I bet the drop in price was the employees selling
2021-04-15 05:17:48,wallstreetbets,I got a head nod once. I took that as a good thing.
2021-04-15 05:25:04,wallstreetbets,My boss gave out coupons for angry handy Js in the back office
2021-04-15 05:46:55,wallstreetbets,These guys live in SF tho right? So this is like 2 months rent and a hot dog...
2021-04-15 06:07:30,wallstreetbets,why didn‚Äôt i receive mine
2021-04-14 20:26:40,wallstreetbets,I once got assaulted by my boss and then blackmailed and fired simultaneously
2021-04-14 21:32:31,wallstreetbets,So they lost money on their first day on the job?
2021-04-14 21:32:30,wallstreetbets,I would dump all my shares at 429 because in my opinion the company would thrive and I would want someone else to have a chance at that success like chiamato did with that one spac
2021-04-14 22:46:54,wallstreetbets,"If they sold at the top it wouldve been 42,000. That's a meme right there"
2021-04-15 04:09:41,wallstreetbets,Bout to go be the janitor at coinbase
2021-04-15 05:24:50,wallstreetbets,I get to do other peoples work...
2021-04-15 07:23:55,wallstreetbets,"So, they gave 100 shares to their employees.

Whoop see doo."
2021-04-15 09:43:51,wallstreetbets,If COIN finds it's way back up near $400 there is going to be a massive sell off of people trying to recoup their purchase on the open yesterday...
2021-04-15 10:59:53,wallstreetbets,Coinbase is gonna be interesting on this sub if it's talked about.  Seeing as your comments will get removed for talking about what it does.
2021-04-15 13:43:20,wallstreetbets,"Coinbase has about 5% of the market cap of Google. I‚Äôd bet Google could build a better version of Coinbase if they devoted 5% of their effort to it. I like Coinbase, but the valuation is hard to justify."
2021-04-15 14:20:45,wallstreetbets,Good for them. Minor dilution not even worth mentioning but means a lot to most employees.
2021-04-15 15:33:04,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs why being in a union in my opinion is much better..
2021-04-15 16:52:17,wallstreetbets,I got to work at half salary for 2 months this year.
2021-04-14 22:55:54,wallstreetbets,"And that‚Äôs why the price tanked...

I worked for a company that offered to buy employee stock options a few months before a planned IPO. I was amazed how many people wanted their marshmallow right then instead of waiting a few months for three marshmallows. The majority of them took the buy back offer."
2021-04-14 21:11:48,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm so sick of their YouTube ads I hope they go bust
2021-04-14 20:48:05,wallstreetbets,How the fuck does coinbase have 1700 employees?
2021-04-14 20:56:10,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôve been stealing sheets of paper towels from my work. Not all at once, in staggered random amount amounts to avoid arising suspicion. Samesies I guess"
2021-04-15 03:10:00,wallstreetbets,"Those employees may want to sell before people realize Paypal is the future of Crypto, not Coinbase."
2021-04-14 20:52:11,wallstreetbets,"Oooh that's a bold play. They don't want their guys going to compete anywhere. From what I remember in corporate training, you HAVE to disclose any monetary investments you have that are over 25k. At that point the company can decide whether you have too much of a vested interest in a competitor to have on.   
They are not only incentivizing their employees to build a good company, they're giving them a difficult out with that large of a gift. It's also an open bonus of several thousands depending on whether they want to dip quick or stay on to see if multiply."
2021-04-14 22:39:54,wallstreetbets,So I was out hunting COIN epmloyees the other daayy....
2021-04-15 03:08:17,wallstreetbets,I guess now i know why the stock dropped
2021-04-15 03:49:38,wallstreetbets,1700 Employees?  What in the actual fuck do the do with 1700 employees?
2021-04-15 01:37:25,wallstreetbets,"I am sorry, but why is COIN worth even more than a billion? They have an app, a website, and some basic trading features. 

It's not like they are unique or anything."
2021-04-14 22:45:45,wallstreetbets,The stock is worth it more in the long run. Coinbase's value is worth $600 within 24 months considering it's position in the industry for ecoins.
2021-04-14 23:39:42,wallstreetbets,"Then the US government stole three quarters of it in tax to fund their evil, corrupt, incompetent, mafia system where you are forced to give money to them and receive virtually nothing back."
2021-04-15 01:49:11,wallstreetbets,Cool they gave everyone 15$? LMAO
2021-04-14 20:04:44,wallstreetbets,"I think it opened at like $381, so it would actually be $38,100. Wonder how many sold at open. Really awesome of Coinbase regardless."
2021-04-14 20:04:46,wallstreetbets,If it‚Äôs before DPO what was price?
2021-04-14 20:06:20,wallstreetbets,I got a $5 bday coupon for our in-house Cafe once. I‚Äôve been working at home since last March and can‚Äôt redeem it...
2021-04-14 20:19:46,wallstreetbets,They can afford it.
2021-04-14 20:33:29,wallstreetbets,My boss and I were walking for a coffee once. We saw a quarter on the floor. He let me keep it.
2021-04-14 20:34:03,wallstreetbets,Had orders in this morning and then jumped out at 10am because paper hands feels aids man.
2021-04-14 20:42:51,wallstreetbets,thats very nice of them
2021-04-14 20:45:55,wallstreetbets,"That‚Äôs very nice of them, I contributed to that, where‚Äôs my thank you ?? Hahaha"
2021-04-14 20:46:47,wallstreetbets,Based
2021-04-14 20:47:36,wallstreetbets,What was the strike price?
2021-04-14 20:53:54,wallstreetbets,I think my US Saving Bond is worth more!  Thanks Robinhood!
2021-04-14 20:54:04,wallstreetbets,"100 stocks actually, which today was 340-420 five or take. Quite the gift"
2021-04-14 21:15:38,wallstreetbets,That explains the dip
2021-04-14 21:17:50,wallstreetbets,and they all dumped it at open on us
2021-04-14 21:36:40,wallstreetbets,They suck regardless
2021-04-14 21:39:14,wallstreetbets,noice! I like companies which offer stocks and options to employees!
2021-04-14 21:47:51,wallstreetbets,Not even a vowl of mints at muh jerb
2021-04-14 21:50:16,wallstreetbets,I got  .60 cent raise.  Fml
2021-04-14 21:53:04,wallstreetbets,Who the funk cares?
2021-04-14 21:56:04,wallstreetbets,So that‚Äôs who dumped it
2021-04-14 21:57:45,wallstreetbets,"That's awesome, wish I worked at Coinbase"
2021-04-14 21:59:30,wallstreetbets,My company did 10k
2021-04-14 22:06:39,wallstreetbets,Definitely not the reason for the drop. Employees shares are mostly restricted from selling until the lockup is over.
2021-04-14 22:10:19,wallstreetbets,$25k / 1700? Cheap bastards
2021-04-14 22:16:06,wallstreetbets,So get out before they can sell? Whats the term? 6 month?
2021-04-14 22:26:23,wallstreetbets,I got sexual favors from my manager once
2021-04-14 22:26:49,wallstreetbets,I got in trouble for not making an finance server open to the public. He wanted to make it accessible through the internet around the world.
2021-04-14 22:29:40,wallstreetbets,I get yelled at...every single day by my boss
2021-04-14 22:55:54,wallstreetbets,My boss stole 22 grand from his employees
2021-04-14 23:01:54,wallstreetbets,Any day now I‚Äôm going to get that email about working so hard for my company I get the promotion over that guy brown nosing the boss all day doing nothing! Gonna be SWEET!
2021-04-14 23:10:53,wallstreetbets,"That's great for those employees who have put in little or no overtime, but talk to folks on their engineering teams.  There are some there, who even with this are technically still in the hole for going above and beyond by putting in all those extra hours, i.e., working for free. I wonder if they feel like chumps?"
2021-04-14 23:13:29,wallstreetbets,That is some ones's loss porn
2021-04-14 23:40:49,wallstreetbets,Now this is how you get my business
2021-04-15 00:07:28,wallstreetbets,'COIN'? What happened to... ALL YOUR BASE?
2021-04-15 00:12:51,wallstreetbets,And this is why I should have never gotten into government work and should have chosen more wisely.
2021-04-15 00:28:28,wallstreetbets,i got fired for taking a covid quarantine from amazon
2021-04-15 00:28:30,wallstreetbets,"Uniswap gifted $13,500 to everyone who ever used the app once."
2021-04-15 00:30:38,wallstreetbets,One time...I got fired...on my day off....
2021-04-15 00:31:28,wallstreetbets,"My ex company would give gift cards as incentive to perform above standards to their own shop and classify them as a taxable benefit , so u would essentially get double taxed on it and be forced to spend it at their shop. #loblaws"

2021-04-15 00:38:14,wallstreetbets,"Clownbase, too incompetent to hide that they are frontrunning their customers."
2021-04-15 01:03:38,wallstreetbets,"Is that averaged? Like $10 to 1699 employees and ~$10,000 to the boss? (Smooth brain math tiem)"
2021-04-15 01:18:24,wallstreetbets,One time I got to get 10 minutes lunch break
2021-04-15 01:25:32,wallstreetbets,We got our shifts shortened by 10+ hours a fortnight and we got a 15 dollar gift card for the same store we worked in...
2021-04-15 01:27:29,wallstreetbets,I guess that explain the dumping going on today.
2021-04-15 01:30:43,wallstreetbets,It's over 33k now.  The pre ipo price tag was $250 the beginning of today.  It peaked around 420 then backed down to $338.
2021-04-15 01:34:11,wallstreetbets,Those were sold immediately
2021-04-15 01:41:07,wallstreetbets,It was 100 shares so more like 38k on open today
2021-04-15 01:48:15,wallstreetbets,I worked 28 hours straight to compete an audit for a legal client while working for a big 4 accounting firm. The partner (lower case on purpose) said thank you for getting the job over the line and gave me a can of Diet Coke.
2021-04-15 01:49:27,wallstreetbets,Good on COIN - Absolutely justified!!
2021-04-15 01:53:48,wallstreetbets,One time I got a 40% paycut from my employer when they moved me stores and didn't tell me. I didn't know until I saw it on my paycheck. Needless to say they're not out of business lol
2021-04-15 01:56:45,wallstreetbets,"Before Covid, we used to have Coffee, Doughnuts and Bagels about 4 times a year.

Life is Grand!"
2021-04-15 02:20:08,wallstreetbets,My boss once fired me
2021-04-15 02:20:45,wallstreetbets,One time I got laughed at when asking for a raise even though the managers got a bonus.

2021-04-15 02:30:08,wallstreetbets,"I interviewed there a couple years ago. My Sketchmeter(TM) kept going off during the interview, they didn‚Äôt want to answer what I thought were simple questions about the company. 

Hopefully they aren‚Äôt screwing over their employees somehow. Those ‚Äúgifts‚Äù are often something else."
2021-04-15 02:40:15,wallstreetbets,"They forget the support team apparently. 

When they cover that mishap its going to shoot up 1701 employees."
2021-04-15 03:12:53,wallstreetbets,This one time my work gave us a pizza party

2021-04-15 06:28:23,wallstreetbets,It will drop below 150.  It is not worth what it's priced at.

2021-04-15 09:23:10,wallstreetbets,What are your realistic $COIN predictions this week? It was supposed to start at $250 but ended up being $400 something and a lot of people complained it‚Äôs a wealth transfer from retail to insiders. What does future look like ?

2021-04-15 11:50:20,wallstreetbets,"Ok $25000 Devided by 1700 = $14

They gave me a raise of $11 BUT only when I was the only manager on the site (which was usually only 1 out of the 10 hours of my daily shift). They didn't tell me this until I got my first check after the raise... I also realized they LOWERED my pay rate to $7/hr whenever i had to take the position of an ""insider"" (someone who just makes pizzas inside the store).

My work never changed between any of these ""positions"" but they insisted because I wasn't the ""head manager"" on the site i couldnt be payed like one.. even though I was doing management work the entire time."

2021-04-15 01:25:57,wallstreetbets,Many more need to be accustomed to seeing this. It‚Äôs always a numbers game. Sure there may have been some incredible opportunities in hindsight but they‚Äôre not the norm.

In fact big tech doesn‚Äôt even pay the most. Certain unicorns pay more than the equivalent at  FAANG. HFs like JS pay their new grads $400k, which is double or more than double most FAANG new grads"

2021-04-15 05:03:19,wallstreetbets,"Had a job offer from one of the big tech company a few years ago. The compensation I would have received in stocks for my first four years would be worth a little over 200k cad now, I went with a company paying 8k/y cad more instead lol, i am retarded."
2021-04-15 15:47:04,wallstreetbets,Just because they were no longer operating doesn't always mean they went broke and out of business. Lots of smaller start ups get aquired privately and the employees with stock can make an okay chunk of change that way.

2021-04-14 22:26:32,wallstreetbets,"Wait, you can buy a pool for $500? One you can swim in?"
2021-04-14 23:19:53,wallstreetbets,The guy couldn't scrape together $500 and thought he needed to buy a pool?

2021-04-14 20:47:30,wallstreetbets,The reason it dropped is because IPOs are fucking traps for insiders to sell their stock at absurd prices and have someone else hold the bag.
2021-04-14 20:16:42,wallstreetbets,"Im sure the $25000 worth weren't the only shares available for the employees to sell...

The only way pre-IPO companies are able to find any employees is by offering equity to them long before the IPO."
2021-04-14 22:46:38,wallstreetbets,"Its 100 shares. The IPO was priced at $250 a share. So $25,000. This is before it can be traded in the market.

Also, other employees (you know founders, early investors, any employee with additional equity) and the bank (Goldman Sachs perhaps?) that helped the company go public also own shares and likely sold a lot of shares today."
2021-04-14 20:48:08,wallstreetbets,I think I read yesterday it was 100 per employee
2021-04-14 20:42:25,wallstreetbets,You'd be surprised what a free 85million dollar giveaway will do to people/markets.

2021-04-15 12:38:56,wallstreetbets,It's literally workers owning the means of production. It's usually not done because it isn't stable cash flow. Most people actually need that first before they start owning capital.

I think you are overestimating what it means to be an accredited investor. For example, for some companies the amount you need to be able to invest is so large that only a really tiny percentage of accredited investors can do something. Most deals are done before individuals get to see any deals, which means that those were deals that weren't good enough for the institutions.

I don't think it matters if someone offers an unattractive investment. You just should not burn your money on companies that don't really have a lot of value.

Buy low, sell high. 

I made an investment in a public company that developed a method to make cheap graphene (the wonder material) and also has specialized process knowledge which makes them inevitable for certain high quality electronic components. The graphene capability was not priced in by the market appropriately (IMHO), so I bought. 

Guess what happened? They have grown their business and stock price went up more than the rest of the market. 

I made a low risk, high reward bet and it paid of. That's how investing works. 

Buying a new listing, because ""stocks go up"" is not a strategy."

The best way to get a raise these days is to job hop. Loyalty went out the window back in the late 80s and became even more self evident after 2008. It's better to be a mercenary in the job sector timing the business cycle to your advantage than it is to wage slave 9-5 until lay off periods."

To actually get a good company to take your money is a different story.  Generally they want quality investors who bring something to the table.  This usually means big, well known PE firms who will add useful board members.  A good CFO and CEO will negotiate for a good valuation but it's more important to get investors who will help put them on a path to success.

There were cuts depending on your salary range. They knew basically nobody could leave because the economy stunk at that time.   


So some people were kinda pissed, some were super pissed but everyone then interpreted that the higher paid people were more pissed. It was like a case study on what NOT to do for a bad news roll-out. It was basically the equivalent of emailing out if everyone was above or below X annual salary.   


Now I work in a place that actually has decently above market salaries, annual bonuses, merit increases, a good 401k match,  promotes internally, a good health plan and a 0% employee contribution and some people actually still complain. Oh and some random Amazon gift cards periodically. Not that I'd actually mention that I'm pretty damn happy with the setup to them."

WHAT THE FUCK.jpg   I had been there for 5 or 6 years, and that had never been the case. I was irate. Called in sick the next day, decided to contact the manager's boss, got the same run around.

I don't see how your ""HFs pay $$$$ for quant!"" insight is supposed to relate to OP saying he opted for stability and benefits from a well-established company over startups like Coinbase that came with risk, nor how it provides generalizable advice for others. 

OP's observation was that while the $25k IPO bonus from Coinbase may sound great to some of you, many of the prospective startups he was comparing with Coinbase failed already, something to keep in mind when feeling FOMO from your secure job at a bigger company. You basically just said the equivalent of ""Instead, consider getting one of the 25 available jobs as a rockstar rocket scientist at a space mining company!"""

2021-04-14 21:00:28,wallstreetbets,"ah well you hit ITM with only a few DTE... basically betting it breaks above the long ~3400 level instead of below. sorry it keeps doing that, one of these times it's going to break through that and sky's the limit"
2021-04-15 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,UPDATE: PLTR YOLO. Sold shares to buy 70 x 4/16 $25c and added more today 
2021-04-14 23:22:11,wallstreetbets,I am happy to see this I was up 293 percent off the bell sold then were. We bottomed out at close I took all 300% and trippled down on calls again for 4/16 at 24 call for .59 bought 12 so please wsb let's squeeze this bitch
2021-04-14 21:06:41,wallstreetbets,Considering averaging down my FDs tomorrow at open.
2021-04-14 21:31:10,wallstreetbets,"Gl bro, I have a single 25.5 4/23c  let's make this bank"
2021-04-15 10:22:04,wallstreetbets,Im in the same boat. I bought 27 C - 4/16 at the very top and im down 88% rn :(
2021-04-14 22:10:27,wallstreetbets,This hurt my brain
2021-04-15 10:33:56,wallstreetbets,"Ugh I was up by some hundreds yesterday, but I didn‚Äôt sell at peak cause I thought it would go up more. I wanna cry ):"
2021-04-14 22:04:33,wallstreetbets,Sleep with my wife
2021-04-14 21:08:08,wallstreetbets,Why not.  Which ones do you have?
2021-04-14 20:59:53,wallstreetbets,"sure. the market manipulators set a trap buy making a wild move from 23.12 all the way up to 26, then crashed it all the way down to 23.75, just to get a few grand from wsb. sure"
2021-04-14 22:47:10,wallstreetbets,So you don‚Äôt think I should‚Äôve added today up to 120 x $25 4/16??
2021-04-15 12:33:56,wallstreetbets,"See you in Valhalla, my friend.  Might as well wait for expiry tomorrow as they're essentially worthless today."
2021-04-15 11:01:20,wallstreetbets,"26,26.5,27"
2021-04-14 21:40:28,wallstreetbets,I tried looking for info around 2-3pm before I went to work and found nothing. Was the event still going?  I wanted to read impressions. I understand the board picture of what they do but specifics are way over my head.
2021-04-14 21:58:58,wallstreetbets,Because I expected it to add at least 10B to PLTR's market cap
2021-04-14 21:32:18,wallstreetbets,What makes u so bullish for eow out of curiosity? Im in 4/16 25C and in the red now :(
2021-04-15 10:45:57,wallstreetbets,Feeling this lol. You think it‚Äôs due some growth today? First hour has been bleh
2021-04-14 23:25:14,wallstreetbets,This! It did this last time we will be ok
2021-04-14 22:54:02,wallstreetbets,I think my options game is weak. Holding an AMC 9.50 call until 16th
2021-04-14 20:06:16,wallstreetbets,This guy's post history is filled with shitting on PLTR. Sorry your puts burned buddy
2021-04-14 20:09:30,wallstreetbets,My man!
2021-04-15 03:32:57,wallstreetbets,Why not threesome?
2021-04-15 11:03:31,wallstreetbets,scooped up some 24.5s though
2021-04-14 23:13:20,wallstreetbets,Lol. Never once traded it because it‚Äôs a shit stock.
2021-04-15 13:54:05,wallstreetbets,YIKES. My puts today are fire! How you doing?
2021-04-15 15:01:48,wallstreetbets,Win some. Lose some.
2021-04-14 20:39:55,wallstreetbets,"Have diamonds hands when everyone has paper hands. Have paper hands when everyone else has diamond hands.

Maybe that's the secret to success? 

I don't know, just speculating."
2021-04-14 23:23:25,wallstreetbets,It's to confusing for a tard like u
2021-04-14 20:42:55,wallstreetbets,Yeah should probably ask someone who is success haha
2021-04-14 23:26:41,wallstreetbets,"LOL. Considering I‚Äôve been using Palantir for a decade or so I think I understand it. Also, the charts don‚Äôt lie."
2021-04-15 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"What happened today with PLTR is completely normal  

I know that some of you are very mad, cuz you bought into the wsb hype, but what happened tha last 2 days is absolutely normal and actually should be expected. Despite the fact that some retail investors think that those kind of events are some huge catalysts, they are just events that are intended to show investors and potential customers the capabilities of the company's products.

However, retail investors hype themselves up and buy the stock just before the event, cuz they either think that others will follow suite or that they will show some ridiculous, innovative technology or product. This of course does not happen, so they immediatly sell their shares, cuz they were in for the short-term anyway. At battery day Elon showed the huge progress that Tesla have made on potentially world-changing battery technology, but shares dumped by more than 15 percent the next day for the following reasons - 1- Tesla did not show an electric jet or a flying car 2. They did not understand anything about what was said and found the event boring 3.They were short-term traders that just played the catalyst. The same thing happened on the day that Apple showed the new Iphone- runup before the event and dump after. Both stocks are up big today.

Now before you ask why didn't you sell your shares if you expected the share price to decrease, I will tell you. Most successful investors will tell you that if you actually believe in the long-term growth of the company, you should not try to time the market. I bought PLTR's CFD's (certificates for difference) at DPO and almost convinced myslef to sell at 15, cuz I throught that the rally will be unsustainable in the short-term, but I am glad that I did not do that and instead I sold at 30. I bought shares this time at 24 average price. Of course I know that even if you are a long-term investor you will still want the share price to increase in the short-term ( there is something called opportunity cost) and I personally would like it better if the company was more transparent with the media and investors, but it is what it is. Just remember that the share price will definitely increase only if PLTR accelerates its revenue growth and customer acquisitions, everything else is speculation.

This is not a financial advice and I promise you that Peter Thiel is not funding my posts."
2021-04-14 20:55:08,wallstreetbets,"lol... I hate PLTR and I still find this post obnoxious. 

first you ignore the previous event that PLTR had, that caused a huge run up. 

then you give advice of not trying to time the market by using a story where you timed the market pretty successfully.

thanks though"
2021-04-14 20:10:03,wallstreetbets,"I've been long but getting a little tired of buying the dip.  It's a bit baffling why institutional investment isnt pouring into PLTR with all the budget commitments to investing in AI for defense in the coming years.  

Thought it was finally getting some momentum but looks like it was tied to the event after the run up evaporated.  

I'm still expecting at least a 300% return from here over the next 4 years."
2021-04-14 21:18:06,wallstreetbets,Wsb needs to grasp that PLTR is a excellent long term play but the attention spans here are too short for that shit
2021-04-14 21:35:29,wallstreetbets,"Dislamer I am no techy data guy so take my opinion with a grain of salt. I think double click was very impressive. Working for a nuclear powr company I see how Foundary would help us in quite a few areas. The connectivity to information which becomes observable data to a consumer is impressive. This could be the new MC Access & exl in the workplace. The market is huge, im not to worried about the retail investors hyping it up because big money will move in when they realize the value."
2021-04-14 20:32:57,wallstreetbets,"you have a point. however. another key takeaway is that short-term betting apes (like myself) need to get used to buy the rumor and sell the news. i cashed in my profits yesterday early, was mad af because i could've made so much more throughout the day, but after seeing today's outcome i'm glad i erred on the paperhanded side of things‚Äîtoo often i've been on the other side but am slowly learning."
2021-04-14 22:07:04,wallstreetbets,"As a long term pltr holder and been riding this absolute shit wave the last 3 months, I can now say without 100% of the doubt, I‚Äôm buying puts the day before the event to hedge against drops. If I lose money on the put, I‚Äôm good, I own enough shares that it won‚Äôt matter. If it goes down, atleast I can take the profit and buy more shares"
2021-04-14 21:17:02,wallstreetbets,Thanks to whoever bought my short term covered calls to help bring down my cost basis
2021-04-14 20:47:06,wallstreetbets,"Who invented the phrase ""buy the rumor sell the news""?

2021-04-14 21:54:19,wallstreetbets,"This has nothing to do with it. All of tech shit, because data is indicating inflation is on the move."

2021-04-15 01:18:45,wallstreetbets,I bought at $9.75. Go eat another banana and stop grunting.
2021-04-15 03:43:12,wallstreetbets,buy the rumor sell the news! and 10% profit is still profit.
2021-04-15 05:11:07,wallstreetbets,"It hit $25 plus today that‚Äôs a big jump it‚Äôll rectrace this momentum next week once it‚Äôs gapped back up $23 to $25

PLTr is a long game set limit buys sub $23 and sell $28 plus if you want out 

$24-$26 calls are bread and butter if you buy months out on a red day just wait it doesn‚Äôt take much momentum to flip and $28-$40 has already been covered"

2021-04-15 07:27:09,wallstreetbets,Well done op for getting it at dpo. I got it on 2nd day at 9.83.

2021-04-15 08:29:10,wallstreetbets,"A few things happened: demo day hype sellers, coin base launch and spy dip. It will go back up. Actually  thought it would be worse!"
2021-04-15 13:41:58,wallstreetbets,"Long term I think it shows promise with emerging A.I technologies in the coming years, so I will hold for a while and continue to buy every week.  People didn't understand double click day and want to thank you for your post. It wasn't what people thought it would be because they were just hearing the news about this and such day. It was a little showcase about what the company does and how it implements itself. That alone makes me feel pretty okay about it long term. They are getting there product out there and seen for people and companies to make a decision on whether or not they want to get it. Not every company that had bought the software liked it either and that is okay, it is being tried, used ,and implemented in many different sectors."

2021-04-15 03:44:02,wallstreetbets,Pltr is not worth its price today. You are buying anticipates growth. If my 17000$ investment drops by half I will be happy that I get an opportunity to add more to my position at a lower price point
2021-04-15 07:51:50,wallstreetbets,"I don't see their software making predictions that humans aren't already making.

The difference is if humans fuck it up they are generally held accountable.

If this software screws.up theyll just claim user error.

2021-04-15 15:34:17,wallstreetbets,Take one for the team plz
2021-04-14 20:13:38,wallstreetbets,If they could have someone do what they do for data to their PR they would be golden. They should have Gary Vaynerchuk get on that.
2021-04-14 21:26:39,wallstreetbets,I agree. I've been a big data developer for 15 years and I have no idea what they actually offer.  Of course that hasnt stopped me from buying nearly 2k shares!
2021-04-15 07:14:20,wallstreetbets,They should hire ja'

2021-04-14 20:46:11,wallstreetbets,"Not even... the last demo it didn't start spiking until two days after demo day... the guy who posted the original dd even said that.

These big institutional investors send their analyst to watch the conference. The analyst goes home afterwards, does some research, writes a report, and then a committee makes a decision. 

If we get some spy red days might even take to next week, but I don't know why people thought instutions would commit vast sums of money instantaneously."

2021-04-14 22:59:02,wallstreetbets,How much premium was it? The IV must have spiked quite a bit. I'm not going to lie; my 26.5cc that I got pennies on was scared of the momentum last night.

2021-04-15 13:57:32,wallstreetbets,THANK YOU! Congratulations on your gains too! Yes after a year of doing this I have learned to have an exit strategy and stick to it. Gains are gains. Welcome to the TSM train. I am hoping they creep up to 120 by EOM so I can lock in 20% gains again. Chip earnings at EOM should help it get there.
2021-04-15 03:23:05,wallstreetbets,Share
2021-04-15 13:24:51,wallstreetbets,I also wanna get in but my cash isn‚Äôt settled!! Should have signed up for margin a long time ago! Anyways what are you buying?
2021-04-15 12:04:52,wallstreetbets,"Yes I cashed in too early, still made 20% profit. Thank you for the info."
2021-04-15 14:21:59,wallstreetbets,Thank you!!!

Nvidia 20% in 1 month.

AMD 12% top 6% rn in one month.

ON 20% on the decline in one month.

AVGO 20% in one month.

TXN 20% in a month.

MU 12% in a month.

Intel 15% on the decline in one month.

LRCX  30% on the decline in a month.

TSMC is probably the stock that will tank the least due to its seat on the table of semis and the fact it wasn't overbought 5 weeks ago."

On a serious note, I was amped up for COIN going public and ready to take the plunge, but something about it didn‚Äôt feel right. Pretty lucky escape"
2021-04-15 03:57:25,wallstreetbets,I think if you hold it it might hit 500. But that's only if qrepto keeps going up. Coinbase is basically going to be controlled by it when it's down coinbase will go down when it's up coinbase will go up

Next time set a limit sell price your comfortable getting out on and never look back unless for round 2. Highest bag holder was $429, and that was less then 30 second transaction. IPO this huge max pop is about 10-15%, which you should have set your price at $410-415."
2021-04-15 01:46:13,wallstreetbets,I just bought 2. That's all I had in my account.

Most people on this sub will make 20k in some dumb options play then turn around and blow 25k in a dumb options play. Fun to watch but 98% of the people in this sub are net net negative in overall trading. Don't worry you are doing just fine. Go buy an index fund and you'll be ahead lmfao. or actually risk reward your trades and yolo 2-5% of your account at a time. That's how you make money long term without luck."
2021-04-14 21:59:11,wallstreetbets,hint: most of then are lying
2021-04-14 22:52:50,wallstreetbets,"Seriously what were you doing that you couldn't buy in at 380ish. What made you think ""I'll let it run up 40 dollars and then get in"" lol. Would have made a clean 10% if you just bought when it started trading. It'll bounce back. Market is about to be WILD rest of 2021 haha."
2021-04-15 08:33:46,wallstreetbets,Bro same. My shitty 401k broker filled my order at $423. When I checked the price seconds later it was in the $380's. Oh well eh? It's just money I guess :P
2021-04-15 16:55:01,wallstreetbets,how many shares?
2021-04-14 21:07:50,wallstreetbets,Not for OP lol

2021-04-14 22:27:22,wallstreetbets,Future contracts at $700 sold yesterday. True apes.
2021-04-14 23:28:09,wallstreetbets,This is the way.
2021-04-15 03:42:03,wallstreetbets,No that‚Äôs the middle. Completing the cycle is buying back in when it goes high again. Been there done that lol

2021-04-15 09:07:21,wallstreetbets,What do you mean? Do stocks that start this high rebound quickly?

2021-04-14 22:55:33,wallstreetbets,exactly. I got in at 380ish and sold right before peak. Easy money. My friend got in after it peaked and pulled back and rode it down. like wtf???
2021-04-15 04:32:39,wallstreetbets,E-Trade if I'm not mistaken.
2021-04-14 22:57:30,wallstreetbets,dude GME is done. Stop losing money on that stinker and make some real money. Gotta learn how to let stuff go
2021-04-14 22:48:24,wallstreetbets,$275? Before the open the Bid was $381. You we‚Äôre dreaming...
2021-04-14 20:17:40,wallstreetbets,ipo is a misnomer really. You are buying an ipo holder's nut sack sweat on the secondary market.
2021-04-15 01:48:00,wallstreetbets,Guess if u keep trying to call the bottom u eventually get it right... hopefully
2021-04-15 15:58:43,wallstreetbets,Just hold buddy or buy more if ya can on the dips .  With the amount of money they taking in on transaction there is no reason the stock won't take off

2021-04-14 21:57:10,wallstreetbets,I wanted to ride the wave and exit close to EOD after a huge run up that never really happened.  Set a stop order one dollar above what I paid at open.  Ended up making 30 bucks on the deal.  Yay me.
2021-04-14 23:59:20,wallstreetbets,"I was going to buy BYND on the day of IPO but it opened at $55 instead of the expected $25. It proceeded to close the week in the $70 range and has never dropped below it's opening price (aside from maybe a couple days during the covid crash).

I was really thinking about getting on that quick action myself, but I have all my money invested elsewhere. So it wasn't really that dumb from OP. He was just slow and timed it poorly."
2021-04-15 08:21:11,wallstreetbets,IPOs have been better off as non-offerings these last few.

2021-04-15 09:02:42,wallstreetbets,Does it mostly always drop same day or later?
2021-04-15 09:22:41,wallstreetbets,Yes. I held off on SNOW at IPO. I'm so glad I did.
2021-04-15 10:34:09,wallstreetbets,agreed.....the only stock that I bought on debut day (rather etf) was arkx but that investment is a bit more safe

2021-04-14 20:35:01,wallstreetbets,"nice. I got in at 390, watched it climb, then freaked out when it dropped and broke even. Waiting for a good entry point, hopefully below 300."
2021-04-15 01:48:33,wallstreetbets,You are right. I should of purchased GME or AMC. I might even take an 80 loss and buy GME.

2021-04-15 15:34:41,wallstreetbets,I think it was 10k min at 250$ which is fair when you can sell them off like this. Thats why it was hundreds of thousands shares on ask orders to sell but even at low price like 260 280 300 saw this level 2 order book before going it live

2021-04-15 09:14:32,wallstreetbets,IPOs and new listings seem to have the price quickly inflated because they are overbought.

2021-04-14 20:36:52,wallstreetbets,"same, but only 4 shares :("

There are worse cases domestically like [Wish.com](https://Wish.com) (it's only like $10 now - it's exactly the business as Amazon)... Others are like POSH...

2021-04-15 13:08:54,wallstreetbets,Ouuuuuch
2021-04-14 21:56:18,wallstreetbets,"Good rule of thumb.  IPOs of smaller unknown companies are priced to pop a little so wary investors don't feel scammed.

Big, hyped and highly anticipated companies are almost always priced poorly.

Obviously there's always exceptions but honestly you'll come out much better if you follow this."
2021-04-15 03:07:11,wallstreetbets,"Not worth it. With my entire budget if bought at what my open price was and sold at the absolute highest price, all i would have made was 300$. Should have spent the money on gamestop like i wanted to."

2021-04-14 22:59:38,wallstreetbets,"Yeah it was only $420 for literally minutes, and my data was fucked up too. I bought @ $381 at the open and my broker site said I was down 30% even as I watched the price going up on Bloomberg."

2021-04-15 08:53:15,wallstreetbets,These are facts realized by government and think tanks and economists etc. It is well known....that is why when there was the pandemic government gave people so much money and STILL tens of millions of Americans are behind on rent. Most Americans are paycheck to paycheck and 1 month if no work means no food. That equates to literally just 1-3k in bank and no safety net. Honestly just Google it. Very well studied.
2021-04-14 23:05:50,wallstreetbets,Yeah thats what happened to my friend. If i'm not in within the first minute of new listings I don't play it til it hits bottom usually.
2021-04-15 06:35:29,wallstreetbets,I have a lot of personal experience with this cycle!
2021-04-15 12:34:09,wallstreetbets,"I think that most people have a yolo account just for dumb shit like this. I know I do, but it sure isn't funded this well."
2021-04-14 20:18:03,wallstreetbets,Can confirm....still feeling the effects of the hopium.  Anxiously awaiting the Euro/Asian markets reaction.
2021-04-15 00:55:12,wallstreetbets,I FOMO‚Äôd 3 shares of FB the day it IPO‚Äôd.
2021-04-15 02:11:48,wallstreetbets,I've heard a lot about this coin
2021-04-15 03:16:41,wallstreetbets,its 2021 why are there still fomophobic people?
2021-04-14 22:07:44,wallstreetbets,Which is worse.
2021-04-15 01:05:25,wallstreetbets,Exactly where I entered. 100 @ $330 almost timed the bottom perfect. I wanted to be in this long term as I hold crypto as well but I wanted a good entry point.
2021-04-14 20:00:22,wallstreetbets,20% gain in a month is bad?  You forget the /s?
2021-04-14 21:07:38,wallstreetbets,"20% a month is roughly 790% profit after just one year, you must have small pockets if that's not retirement money"
2021-04-15 00:09:01,wallstreetbets,My son told me about em. Thought I would buy some for him. First time to try and buy an IPO. Put in my request at the beginning of the day only to find out that it opened $20 higher than the $45 asking price. Needless to say I didn‚Äôt get them. Kept watching to see if it would ever come down.
2021-04-15 06:15:54,wallstreetbets,">Easy, but also very little.

Why you gotta do the entire sub like that man."
2021-04-15 04:20:03,wallstreetbets,5%? Pretty sure it popped like 50 dollars
2021-04-15 10:51:50,wallstreetbets,Closer to 10%.  I bought for 381 at open and sold for 420.69.
2021-04-15 17:54:33,wallstreetbets,">ntire budget if bought at what my open price was and sold at the absolute highest price, all i would have made was 300$. Sh

It depend on how much people is throwing in at open for that 380/381 price. I made 10% of what I thrown in, some people throw in 100K-200K that's easy 10K right there."
2021-04-14 21:51:22,wallstreetbets,This is the Way!
2021-04-14 22:05:21,wallstreetbets,It usually updates live but it might because it was new? Is it a particular form you have to fill?
2021-04-15 10:46:33,wallstreetbets,"You may be right. I ended up getting back in at 330 this morning. If we see a significant drop, I'll buy more"
2021-04-15 04:23:41,wallstreetbets,Also guns are an ultra hedge against a depression or economic collapse. There's literally no conceivable disaster that could cause the price of guns to drop.
2021-04-14 20:58:25,wallstreetbets,"I felt like a kid on Christmas morning again, waking up all psyched, just to have my hopes and dreams crushed."
2021-04-14 20:15:18,wallstreetbets,"Dude, go get your loot boxes on video games or whatever."
2021-04-14 20:26:04,wallstreetbets,Well I hope you're still holding otherwise you're truly retarded.
2021-04-15 12:50:22,wallstreetbets,I just use a portion of my IRA for yolos
2021-04-14 23:14:00,wallstreetbets,Mmmm 100% pure Afghan hopium ü•¥
2021-04-15 03:03:41,wallstreetbets,It went public in the evening for Europe. Anyone who wanted in waited half a day and got in. There's nobody left in the world who wants in at 400. 310$ was a good price to get in though.
2021-04-15 01:43:39,wallstreetbets,Hope you held!
2021-04-15 08:20:25,wallstreetbets,Hahahahahahaha
2021-04-15 06:57:45,wallstreetbets,"No, it isn‚Äôt. Not a single external investor bought shares below the opening price. That is not the case with IPOs where all institutional investors get access to the shares directly from the underwriters at a significantly lower price than the opening.

In other words... NOBODY got to buy shares at the $250 reference price before trading started."
2021-04-15 02:14:11,wallstreetbets,"The price is set @ 250, do you really have big hopes for it staying above 330? COIN is one of its kind but only in this time, pretty sure there are better ones like blockfi which charges or would charge fewer fees"
2021-04-14 20:17:45,wallstreetbets,"GME got people‚Äôs brains all scrambled, man."
2021-04-14 20:17:15,wallstreetbets,"Do. You. Understand. What. Sub. You. Are. In?
  
This is WSB. People here want 20% in *an hour*. 
  
Take that fucking boomer mindset somewhere fucking else. It's not welcome here."
2021-04-14 22:09:27,wallstreetbets,"Yeah most of the sub has small pockets lol. I mean I could yolo 50k tomorrow into Rblx if I wanted but, nah."
2021-04-15 01:04:11,wallstreetbets,I have never seen an IPO / DPO opening at their listed price; it's always been higher.
2021-04-15 00:33:45,wallstreetbets,I bet itll drop a bit more at some point.. not sure about under 70.. but who knows
2021-04-15 03:05:39,wallstreetbets,"> First time to try and buy an IPO.

DPO not IPO. 45$ wasn't asking price, it was valuation. And it did come down. It went up real fast in the short period of time after opening then pulled back to below 70. Wait a couple of weeks and it's above 80 now."
2021-04-15 06:59:21,wallstreetbets,"Hey, if you wanna mass donate to gorillas and coinbase employees, all power to you."
2021-04-15 05:57:20,wallstreetbets,"It as good as opened at 400, and it went only up to 425, for seconds at that."
2021-04-14 22:06:31,wallstreetbets,This is indeed the way!!!

2021-04-15 10:13:32,wallstreetbets,"Oh okay, but doesn‚Äôt that mean it has no institutional backing as well? So, the price they opened at is just Meh. Definitely overvalued for something like coinbase in my opinion."
2021-04-15 09:25:43,wallstreetbets,Price isnt set at anything
2021-04-14 20:22:53,wallstreetbets,"Nah we got moon brains, can't scramble a moon now can you?  Checkmate atheists."

As soon as it hits the market it's really high,or could go low. You never know. I would rather see what the actual prices before I buy it rather than just taking a blind bid. It makes no sense it's like a shot in the dark. Pre IPO sounds like the ticket"

You have incredibly annoying spreads on your calls and the way you go up and down confuses me greatly. But you gave me a 4 bagger so I‚Äôll probably continue buying calls until it eats me alive. You also have outstanding financials and if your p/e becomes industry standard you could easily still go up 33%. Please forgive me for not rolling all my calls up and out immediately but you have to dip at some point. Amen

2021-04-15 04:58:22,wallstreetbets,"I'm holding AMZN $3040c 04/16 

Based on premarket, I'm expecting some gains tomorrow. 

I'm nervous about holding till expiration but I also feel like if tomorrow and Friday are green we could potentially see $3400+ by end of week (about 2% increase). 

I held amzn calls last week as well and sold when I was up and was happy, but realized I missed out on roughly $7,000 of potential profit on calls I owned at one point (not theoretical or what-if I bought). 

I'm chasing losses here, burned my account from 18k to 2k and have made my way back to 9k on calls (I just can't bring myself to buy puts). 

I'd really like to see green in my account for once, it has been nothing but red in my all-time chart since I started. 

I'm wondering, let's say I double my money at open and my call is worth around $5000 (bought in 2500), would it be smarter to sell it, and just buy a different one worth ~ $2000, securing the initial investment and some small profit and limiting potential downside risk of holding? Is this a strategy people use?"

As I was walking along the beach with my penis.
Across the dark sky flashed scenes from my penis.
For each penis, I noticed two sets of penis in the sand,
One belonging to me and one to my penis.
After the last scene of my penis flashed before me,
I looked back at the penis in the sand.
I noticed that at many times along the penis of my life,
especially at the very lowest and saddest penis,
there was only one set of penis.
This really troubled me, so I asked the Penis about it.
""Penis, you said once I decided to follow you,
You'd cum with me all the way.
But I noticed that during the saddest and most penis times of my life,
there was only one set of penis.
I don't understand why, when I needed Penis the most, You would leave me.""
Penis whispered, ""My precious penis, I love you and will never leave you
Never, ever, during your penis and testes.
When you saw only one set of penis,
It was then that I penised you."""

2021-04-15 01:08:36,wallstreetbets,"My April 15 Gameplan:  
Take winnings from my GS MS calls this week and move them to Masco (MAS) for my next earnings boom play.

Masco had great earnings last quarter and in the details shared a backlog of demand in the ‚ÄúHot Tub‚Äù business due to Mexico Covid working conditions.

Since then Stimmy boom has increased hot tub demand at the store.  MAS has a market leading position with NAFTA production.  Competitors have already reported risks in their business due to logistics backup in shipping channels from Asia.

BOOM!

Masco also appears somehow under-analyzed and sometimes miscategorized as a company.  Core business of home improvement products with market leading positions will also contribute to a strong earnings beat.

TL;DR: MAS long until after April 28 Earnings.

BTO MAS May21 $70c FDs"

I""ll have to circle back and touch base, for now it is what it is and we don't know what we don't know. I like to thing of the sub as a family, a team (we play had, we work hard), always going the extra mile so sometimes we get that synergetic flow going and curate the occasional oddities.

I appreciate you reaching out to start a dialogue for us to bounce ideas off of eachother and drill down to the root of the low hanging fruit phrases, a real pig in lipstick fiasco. I'll be out of pocket going forward, but it's on my radar and we'll have all hands on deck leveraged in the backend to do a deep dive while I recharge my bandwidth & ensure the liquor cabinet is stocked. Hopefully we'll manage the optics, see the big picture, get all our ducks in a row and unravel the proverbial pandora's box where the rubber meets the road to take it offline as this is really in our wheelhouse... Bottom line, when you get down to the nuts & bolts we don't need to re-invent the wheel at the end of the day.

Volume and open interest tend to follow.  Retail writes a lot of calls, and institutions may have written varying amounts that would make them wish that the close was at a different price than other institutions who may have an entirely different composition of short calls and puts.  In the end it's reading tea leaves with some possibility of truth which may actually turn out to be a bias (we likely discount the times when a stock closed out the week far from Max Pain).  Also, the 'self-fulfilling prophecy aspect', if enough people believed in it they'd obviously base their trades around it and actively change the outcome by buying it up if it's below Max Pain or shorting if it's above."

2021-04-14 22:38:25,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, no such thing as diamond hands on options you're holding IMO (well, except for DFV's 4/16 $12 calls, what a legend). If IV expands relative to where you bought it AND it goes the direction you wanted, just sell to close and be done with it. Buy a LEAPS or stocks if you wanna keep holding for a long time, or just sell your current call and buy another lottery ticket if that's your thing (although should probably wait for IV to crush in that case)."
2021-04-14 20:09:34,wallstreetbets,Wealth is acquired when you hold. Just ask DFV AND WARREN BUFFET. Fym ?

2021-04-14 21:26:25,wallstreetbets,Any chance TSLA $1000 by May 7?!?

2021-04-14 20:41:06,wallstreetbets,Is TSLA a squeeze?

2021-04-14 21:35:52,wallstreetbets,yes.
2021-04-14 20:54:10,wallstreetbets,Was. Slow squeeze now maybe. Also idk what I'm talking about
2021-04-14 22:50:32,wallstreetbets,Gatsby
2021-04-14 21:35:24,wallstreetbets,youre missing the point entirely. when your trade is down 50% do you sell? or trust your price target and hold with 2 days til expiration? Diamond hands.
2021-04-15 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôve averaged down all that I can. Either this pays off big in long run or I‚Äôll be down huge. Come on Chen... 
2021-04-14 20:51:21,wallstreetbets,"LMAO. I thought this was GME for a minute, and I was like, now how the fuck did this guy manage that. And wouldn't buying at $150 bring his avg wayyy up??"

2021-04-15 02:45:12,wallstreetbets,This thing will be 100 in 2 months and it will stay put. Overvalued and extremely overpriced for the consumer to use on a daily basis. No legs. Buying puts as soon as I can

if you look at other direct listings like SPOT, PLTR, they went down (although not as much as COIN) after open.

Direct listings are more or less a coin flip it seems"
2021-04-14 22:07:07,wallstreetbets,now you're getting it!
2021-04-14 20:25:54,wallstreetbets,Exactly this. Hope some momentum gets going and can unload these COIN bags in the coming year. Before the next crypto winter and halvening and it all goes nuts again. But next time they won't be able to charge absurd fees (1% on large transactions? No thanks).
2021-04-15 10:55:30,wallstreetbets,How much revenue did coin generate in Q1?
2021-04-15 01:42:25,wallstreetbets,Lol I skimmed the S-1 for it and misread the 6 month holding period for rule 144 as the 6 month lock up. So the shares have to have been held by the insiders since before 6 months ago.
2021-04-14 20:17:01,wallstreetbets,It was for the best lol heavily overpriced
2021-04-14 22:36:42,wallstreetbets,Coinbase is not trustworthy. Their subreddit is full of people calling them out for locking their accounts and scamming them. Just look at the top posts over the last month. Somehow their customer support is even worse than Robinhood‚Äôs. They are on par with the most shady financial institutions we have today. I would not trust them to hold my pocket change.
2021-04-14 22:05:16,wallstreetbets,it's not a horrible deal but it's still pretty bad. I'm sure it will one day be worth more

I dont see the US government allowing the dollar to collapse, or the economy to come screeching to a half, just to protect a few market makers.

So, again, your proof that you don't need money to win an election post-Citizens United is Clinton winning an election against a candidate that was superior in every respect except for the lack of money

N.B. I voted for Bernie Sanders in both the 2016 and 2020 primaries and donated money to his campaign. The only difference between you and me is that I'm realistic about how important cash is in elections. See: https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/money-and-elections-a-complicated-love-story/

tl;dr Money isn't the most important thing, but the candidate with more money wins an overwhelming majority of the time.

>and then she lost to another guy who spent less money than her.

Trump had less money in his official campaign account, but nine digits of dark money and the Russian government on his side.

>If you make yourself beholden to a tiny financial elite to win the election, you've already lost, even if you win.

Cool, I'm sure the 500,000 people that died due to the horrid Republican response to COVID are super pleased that Clinton got what was coming to her."

He has certainly made mistakes and CFMA isn't the only one but he fixed CFMA's biggest problem when he took over CFTC and got SOX passed among many other things that shows he has the public interest at heart."

2021-04-14 20:23:51,wallstreetbets,"Yes, that's called making markets. They don't profit off of the direction of those indices, they profit off of fees and commissions and the premium they get on the bid ask spread (which partially offsets their credit risk). 

As a tangible example, let's say some huge corporation sells bonds and wants to offset interest rate risk so they enter into an interest rate swap. It's highly unlikely they are going to find a counter party to enter a bi lateral agreement with, and if they did they would have to take on the credit risk of the counter party. Instead they go to GS. GS writes them a contract and then immediately tries to offer/create a bunch of opposing IR swaps to remain market neutral. That's what market making is."

2021-04-15 08:26:53,wallstreetbets,"It does, when you sell (write) a call option, your putting up your stocks as collateral. So, if the stock price doesn‚Äôt go below the strike price or break even, you would then have to sell your shares at the strike price of the contract if the buyer of your call option exercises the contract. If it‚Äôs below the strike price or at break even typically the stock is worthless and you get to keep the whole premium as a gain.

Now, selling a put option is different. You don‚Äôt actually have to own the shares. Writing a put option means you contractually agree that if the price goes below the strike price you have to buy the shares at that strike price of the contract. Technically, selling (writing) a put option has unlimited risk. Well unlimited being in the sense that if stock ABC is valued at $50, and you write a put contract for $45 priced at $2, if the price were to crash to zero, you‚Äôd have to pay the buyer of your contract 100 shares of $45 = $4,500. The max gain you could have got from writing the put option was only $200. So, you have to be very careful with selling (writing) put options. They‚Äôre typically used to hedge a short position or ‚Äúcover‚Äù a short. 

Writing a call option, the loss can be the difference between the stock price when the buyer exercise versus the value of the stock. So, let‚Äôs say I write a call option for $55 at a cost of $2 per share which is the premium, if the stock drops to 25$, you have a loss of $30 per share or $3000.00 because now you have to sell your shares at the strike price to the buyer of your contract. If let‚Äôs say the price goes above $53 that‚Äôs the break even point or profit point for call sellers because the contract would be deemed worthless. Break even point is $53 because the premium is at $2 per share.

Now, buying options whether a call or put is fairly simple and the potential loss is limited to your premium price, but selling (writing) contracts are a little more complex and for selling (writing) a put, it can carry unlimited loss (If the stock price goes to zero for example). So, for writing options, definitely take the time you really understand it before writing them. Especially for a put as the loss can be big.

Writing a call option - Your putting your stock up as collateral, as a call option seller, you hope the price goes down from the strike price.

Writing a put option - You contractually agree to buy the shares at the strike price if the contract you wrote is out of the money for you as a seller. As a put seller, you hope the price goes up from the strike price.

Ex: I sell a put option with a strike price of $50. If the stock price drops to $10 a share, the buyer of my contract can and will exercise it, once they do that I now have to buy 100 shares at $50 for the buyer when the stock is valued only at $10."

2021-04-15 18:55:17,wallstreetbets,"You have to buy the shares at a higher price than what the stock is worth if you sell puts. 

buying GME at $400 when it is worth $165 currently isn't the smart thing to do."
2021-04-14 20:49:44,wallstreetbets,"And that‚Äôs the magic of options. With the right conditions you can make enormous gains when a stock makes big moves towards being In The Money. Or more frequently, you get bent over and your contracts expire worthless. Fun!"
2021-04-15 00:58:03,wallstreetbets,I saw that you had asked about specific good/bad IV targets when buying options. I look to usually buy at <70% IV. Anything over 100% and you‚Äôre usually overpaying bigly for the options.

2021-04-14 22:05:55,wallstreetbets,"I also wanted to add something after reading your question over again. You can sell your options contract whenever you‚Äôd like as long as it‚Äôs before the end of the expiration date. An example to provide, you buy a call option valued at $1200.00. The actual stock share price is $90, but your contract strike price is $100. In this case the scenario is not exactly %10 of the stock share price per contract share price. Let‚Äôs say your brokers/markets price is priced at $12 per share. So an option contract which is 100 shares is valued at $1,200. You pay $1200 for 1x call option contract with a strike price of $100 and the expiration date is April 30th and we‚Äôre currently April 14th in this example.

Now your holding 1x call option contract valued at $1,200 expiring on April 30th. Two days in the future, April 16th, the stock price jumps from $90 to $180. The stock has now gained %100 gain and now your broker values your $100 strike price call option at $48 per share. Your call option contract has just made a %400 gain and now your $1200.00 call option is now worth $4800.00, with a gain profit of 400% and now you can sell your contract 2 days after buying it and get a return on investment of %400.

Obviously this example is quite extreme but this is a good example of how options contracts can leverage more shares for higher gain at a cheaper price.

FD or CFD that you see in the WSB subreddit beside the amount of people who joined WSB are apes buying last minute call or put options that are so far OTM (Out the money) and is considered such a retarded play with very low odds of success, but if they hit they make stupid gains. üòÇ You can‚Äôt do nothing but respect it you know üòÇ, but this is definitely not financially appropriate and is not suggested, but to each their own right."

2021-04-14 22:30:42,wallstreetbets,"Awesome info, again thank you. I actually just asked the question earlier in another thread about selling the contract before the shares reach your strike price. Didn't think you could do that, and didn't understand you could still make a profit even if it didn't hit your strike.

And ya, these crazy yolo calls with dumb gains are just that, serious bets with the potential for huge losses...but hey it IS WSB amirite?"
2021-04-15 04:02:35,wallstreetbets,"Why does the contract value/call option per share value quadruple here if the value of the stock has only doubled, where does the second factor of 2 come in?"

It‚Äôd be easier if I had $25k in my TD account to meet the day trading minimum. I‚Äôve been burned a couple times by not wanting to get dinged for too many round trip trades in a 5 day period."

2021-04-15 08:45:01,wallstreetbets,"IV - implied volatility. The stock is gaining momentum and positive sentiment and is pushing resistance lines, so the odds let‚Äôs say of the stock to continue increasing is probably high so the call option contract initially bought in my example is valued more. Now, what I wrote was just an example to explain it. There‚Äôs a lot of factors MM use to appraise the value of an options contract."
2021-04-14 23:39:34,wallstreetbets,Yup
2021-04-15 06:11:47,wallstreetbets,you mean that you would prefer daytrade directly rather than doing call?
2021-04-15 14:53:23,wallstreetbets,Appreciate the response yo
2021-04-15 11:31:54,wallstreetbets,"No. Unless you have $25,000 in your trading account you can't have 4 or more round trip day trades in a rolling 5 day period. What that means is you can't open and close a position in the same trading day more than three times in a rolling five day period. If you get flagged for day trading after that 4th day trade without the required equity ($25,000) you can have your account suspended so you can't make any trades at all for 90 days (except closing out existing positions).

With the volatility of options trading you can open a position in the morning and be up 200+% later that day. If you sold those contracts that's one hit against your rolling limit. If you're already close to your limit and you can't sell without getting flagged then by the next trading day those options could be worthless depending on what the price of the stock does.

Same applies for regular stock trading as well, it's just easier to avoid when there's rarely swings of 20% or more on a stock that you bought the same day."

I've known at some point that /r/wallstreetbets will have to find a place for it.  As much as some of us hate it, there are just as many that love it and the way I've always tried to shape the sub is to never gatekeep, allow everyone to feel welcome, and always be able to adapt.  I don't see the point in delaying the inevitable anymore as crypto is here to stay.

2021-04-15 17:55:26,wallstreetbets,Well. That went swimmingly.
2021-04-14 20:38:39,wallstreetbets,WHERE MY ETHBROS AT
2021-04-15 07:38:45,wallstreetbets,Doge is going to be put on the moon by papa Elon. Aliens will think our king is a dog! Yee haw
2021-04-15 07:07:55,wallstreetbets,Doge+ coin + stonk = üöÄ
2021-04-15 09:38:36,wallstreetbets,There should be a new sub reddit called crypto bets or some shit.
2021-04-14 20:54:31,wallstreetbets,The gain porn will be MASSIVE.
2021-04-14 22:54:59,wallstreetbets,"No Highs no Lows, only DOGE"
2021-04-14 23:44:22,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm ready for the crypto thread! Dogecoin to $1 or bust !
2021-04-14 23:53:09,wallstreetbets,Crypto is what us addicts do on weekends and holidays.
2021-04-15 00:50:22,wallstreetbets,I love doge
2021-04-15 07:18:47,wallstreetbets,Everyone just buy doge everyone everyday
2021-04-15 07:23:31,wallstreetbets,This forum just went to the Doge‚Äôs.
2021-04-15 15:20:09,wallstreetbets,This decision aged well
2021-04-15 15:38:12,wallstreetbets,Milk lasts longer
2021-04-14 20:03:13,wallstreetbets,"As a DOGE owner, I appreciate this!"
2021-04-14 20:06:00,wallstreetbets,I've been holding 4k doge since 2015 when I was just in highschool why the fuck would I sell at 12 cent
2021-04-14 20:08:00,wallstreetbets,I like how DOGE is allowed over other ticker names that actually have meaning.
2021-04-14 20:08:03,wallstreetbets,Hell yeaah! GO DOGE!!!
2021-04-14 20:14:32,wallstreetbets,"Haha so this sub is gunna be GME and DOGE. 

Welcome to hell, the sequel."
2021-04-14 21:25:01,wallstreetbets,Where my diamond paws at?
2021-04-14 22:14:17,wallstreetbets,Thank you for finally accepting Dogecoin <3
2021-04-14 22:43:41,wallstreetbets,"Everyone losing there damn minds about the inclusion of doge, a meme coin on a meme sub. FFS half the posts here are gifs about about apes and shit. 

There‚Äôs an entire crypto sub if people want to talk about obscure cryptos 20 other people have heard of that have better tech, smart contracts and are going to blow up any day now. WSB is just as a delusional, but at least has some level of self awareness about it, and doge fits here imo."
2021-04-15 06:53:36,wallstreetbets,"Thanks finally can say something about $COIN, and DOGE üòÅüòÅüòÅ"
2021-04-15 10:21:07,wallstreetbets,Well this aged poorly.

2021-04-14 21:00:07,wallstreetbets,Sir for the third time THIS IS A FUCKING WENDYS
2021-04-14 23:20:21,wallstreetbets,Not litecoin? Seems weird to leave that out
2021-04-14 23:38:29,wallstreetbets,Weird it‚Äôs limited to 3 cryptos and not other strong long term holds like BCH. Seems like a lot of self interest involved picking these names....
2021-04-15 00:43:21,wallstreetbets,Wait...I thought this was a GME only sub?
2021-04-15 00:50:07,wallstreetbets,Wait till the apes realize you can buy ETH options.
2021-04-15 02:08:24,wallstreetbets,Ethereum is the way to go
2021-04-15 03:31:57,wallstreetbets,"I was holding about $20 of DOGE I got as a joke because I'm a dog person(plus it's fun to buy a lot of something), everyone got excited about it so I upped my buy-in to $40... And then I sold when it hit $0.08 the first time so I could pay the water bill. Learn from my tragedy, keep your diamond hands strong üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠"
2021-04-15 09:41:40,wallstreetbets,There's always crypto in the banana stand.
2021-04-14 20:42:53,wallstreetbets,I jumped on the DOGE train and it's been hauling ass!

2021-04-15 08:30:49,wallstreetbets,"Dogecoin all the way. 

They said it‚Äôll never get to $0.10. It got there days ago. 

Now they saying $1.00 will never happen. Just you wait."
2021-04-14 20:54:21,wallstreetbets,DOGE. Ahhhh that feels good to say here :)
2021-04-14 21:54:47,wallstreetbets,"Wth is everyone bitching because they allowed doge instead of another coin?  Quit crying!  Doge is trending all the time with a bigger support community than most others ..maybe even every other!

2021-04-14 22:12:52,wallstreetbets,"I very much look forward to the stonky boys yoloing into everything not understanding the basic blockchain tech or freaking out at the 20, 40, 80% crashes."
2021-04-14 22:15:16,wallstreetbets,Very good. Much crypto. Wow
2021-04-14 22:37:06,wallstreetbets,Fuck you. Algo is better than Eth. $50 transaction fees my ass.
2021-04-14 22:55:00,wallstreetbets,"Bruh, bring on the fucking doge talk. My body is ready"
2021-04-14 23:28:33,wallstreetbets,"It's too late for life changing gains.. This should have been allowed here long ago which may have convinced some of you to 20x or 100x your investment from last May. 11 months ago.

There's probably a lesson here.

The crypto subreddits all have hard on's for crypto and just want good news. People here seem to be smart and analytical. This is exactly where crypto should have been discussed."
2021-04-14 23:45:28,wallstreetbets,BTC/ETH are the future pillars of the global economy
2021-04-15 00:11:21,wallstreetbets,This is the way! DOGEcoin to the moon!
2021-04-15 00:11:35,wallstreetbets,People here would be less poor if we did this a long time ago.
2021-04-15 00:16:20,wallstreetbets,"All I know is, I‚Äôve lost a shit ton of money on the stock market but made it all back and then some with crypto. I don‚Äôt even really like stocks anymore, unless you get super lucky with an option, you‚Äôre not going to be making crypto money."
2021-04-15 00:17:06,wallstreetbets,So I won't get banned anymore?
2021-04-15 00:21:01,wallstreetbets,"I'm more into crypto than Wallstreet, but when I got a post deleted here because it was about crypto, I honestly respected this sub even more.  Cheers to you guys for doing you."
2021-04-15 00:26:25,wallstreetbets,Eth will be a trillion dollar market cap coin by the end of this year! So about 8.5k per ETH.
2021-04-15 00:38:46,wallstreetbets,2days later: everyone on this thread permabanned
2021-04-15 00:42:05,wallstreetbets,"Fuck it, I‚Äôve got almost everything I have riding on crypto, let it crash I don‚Äôt give a fuck, if it pays off, maybe I won‚Äôt be on here, I just want to go places"
2021-04-15 01:02:19,wallstreetbets,You‚Äôre going to limit it to 3 coins? Here I thought this was progress for the sub.
2021-04-15 01:03:31,wallstreetbets,"So, who sold their DOGE right before it went up, I know I did."
2021-04-15 01:34:52,wallstreetbets,This is the end
2021-04-15 01:53:08,wallstreetbets,Crypto in WSB? Even bigger news than COIN listing!
2021-04-15 01:56:22,wallstreetbets,"Doge. Bitcoin. Crypto. 


Will this comment stay?"
2021-04-15 02:13:08,wallstreetbets,No love for ADA? Sad.
2021-04-15 02:17:53,wallstreetbets,You are allowing doge but not alts with actual potential and much larger market caps? Why?
2021-04-15 02:34:26,wallstreetbets,Why the fuck would you allow doge.
2021-04-15 04:53:43,wallstreetbets,Now i can say this: Eth
2021-04-15 05:54:00,wallstreetbets,The crypto market has been so dogish lately
2021-04-15 06:06:37,wallstreetbets,everyone here thinking if they throw a couple of thousands into $COIN that they'll double their money but fail to see that investing in Ethereum alone would eclipse any gains you would ever make in COIN by eoy. eth to the moon
2021-04-15 07:18:28,wallstreetbets,WOw thank you mods! I don't post much because I really don't know shit. But I do hodl a position in crypto. I have felt nervous even commenting on the COIN posts due to the hatred of crypto. Thanks for this!
2021-04-15 08:34:55,wallstreetbets,"In retrospect, it was inevitable."
2021-04-15 09:16:46,wallstreetbets,HODL HODL HODL
2021-04-15 09:29:10,wallstreetbets,"If mods were smart they would have realized this long ago.

What makes you jokers think you are worthy of bitcoin?"
2021-04-15 12:13:56,wallstreetbets,Wow.. This a great opportunity from the moderators.. This will really help in enlightening the ideas of new investors in the crypto market.. Wallstreetbet has always been the sub for entrepreneur's..

2021-04-14 21:48:33,wallstreetbets,Doge
2021-04-15 05:31:58,wallstreetbets,Ethereum does everything Bitcoin does but MORE.
2021-04-15 09:39:41,wallstreetbets,"Bitcoin, Etherium, and Doge

That‚Äôs like saying Babe Ruth, Mickey Mantle, and the retarted boy down the street."
2021-04-14 20:47:02,wallstreetbets,Dodge.... the meme continues.
2021-04-14 23:00:28,wallstreetbets,You had me at ‚ÄúDOGE‚Äù.
2021-04-14 23:24:39,wallstreetbets,If they want to talk about DOGE they really don‚Äôt know anything about crypto
2021-04-15 00:17:30,wallstreetbets,I made $20 of doge into $170. I am still very confused. I thought money was supposed to be thrown in the trash.
2021-04-15 01:31:01,wallstreetbets,DOGE is going to make me debt free üöÄü§ë
2021-04-15 04:23:55,wallstreetbets,The day doge hits double digits is the day I retire
2021-04-14 20:41:13,wallstreetbets,"Y‚Äôall better buy doge now before your not just talking shit, but you actively talk shit and lost a huge opportunity to make tendies. Take doge serious."
2021-04-14 22:39:17,wallstreetbets,Doge on the move..
2021-04-15 01:15:29,wallstreetbets,Why buy coin and not just buy Doge?
2021-04-15 07:18:47,wallstreetbets,"HEY, r/wallstreetbets, wanna get rich? Buy doge you fuckin retards or be poor forever."
2021-04-14 20:02:13,wallstreetbets,"Lets take doge to a buck, thats what any poor ape will have enough too.. we can only dreamüêµüêµ"
2021-04-14 20:04:22,wallstreetbets,Join Coinbase! Where you can see the cryptos that are making mad money... aren't supported by coinbase.
2021-04-14 20:04:27,wallstreetbets,COIN is the new SNOW
2021-04-14 20:06:24,wallstreetbets,Duharara Doggy coin gud!
2021-04-14 20:08:21,wallstreetbets,I really like this new floor for Doge. I can easily see it going to $1 in a few years or less.
2021-04-14 20:11:11,wallstreetbets,"Oh how I love all of you fucking apes.  I don't know my ass from my elbow when it comes to stocks or crypto but I just love how everyone in this sub bags on each other, says extremely offensive things to each other, and nobody gets offended.  This is the only place you can find this on reddit.  Now go suck your wife's boyfriend's peepee."
2021-04-14 20:19:49,wallstreetbets,What do you think the legitimate price target for DOGE is?
2021-04-14 20:23:10,wallstreetbets,"Are we booking ""If BTC/ETH/DOGE hits __ I'll do ___"" comments?"
2021-04-14 20:24:13,wallstreetbets,Damn crypto about to go crazy now. Apes together & strong!!!
2021-04-14 20:29:25,wallstreetbets,Much praise for including DOGE. üòä
2021-04-14 20:32:53,wallstreetbets,"Missed out on GME. Got in at an okay time with AMC. Got in on DOGE.

2021-04-14 20:34:50,wallstreetbets,"You and the other moderators should be ashamed of yourselves for selling out, but I doubt you have the capability."
2021-04-14 20:35:19,wallstreetbets,You could not live with your own failure. Where did that bring you? Back to me.

While I‚Äôm here though, all I‚Äôll say is that I‚Äôve lost my shirt in the stock market since joining this group, but BTC has been holding it down so I‚Äôm happy I can come back here without getting depressed üòÇ"
2021-04-14 20:59:54,wallstreetbets,"Good now remove my ban

Edit: wow okay it‚Äôs gone."
2021-04-14 21:46:47,wallstreetbets,So is this the Doge thread? Or it somewhere else?
2021-04-14 21:55:42,wallstreetbets,Yeah this is the top
2021-04-14 22:03:45,wallstreetbets,This is way worse than banning Crypto discussion. Algorand is the future.
2021-04-14 22:08:20,wallstreetbets,"years of failed attempts to get my parents to look into BTC. Today my dad calls telling me he saw something on Fox about this BiT Coin, now he thinks it may be something after all! Same day wsb comes around. Nice seeing the world catch up"
2021-04-14 23:03:34,wallstreetbets,Just an FYI: DOGE has an unlimited supply. Tread carefully.
2021-04-14 23:06:53,wallstreetbets,"How the fuck did doge make the list?? Don't get me wrong, I'm doge pack but like... What?!"
2021-04-14 23:21:58,wallstreetbets,This sub sucks so much now. We were retarded before ape.
2021-04-14 23:22:50,wallstreetbets,yay thank you was tired of getting my messages removed. people in here need to know the joys of day trading crypto. so much more action as crypto never sleeps. I tripled my money in the last 3 weeks with crypto and may be moving away from fiat stocks entitely soon once I reap my pandemic recovery profits.
2021-04-14 23:29:08,wallstreetbets,What a great idea. Let‚Äôs go!

2021-04-15 00:07:31,wallstreetbets,Finally. Ether gang rise up
2021-04-15 00:09:28,wallstreetbets,"To all the haters, it is 10x easier to make money with crypto than with WSB. I dabbled in WSB before it was mainstream. Burned 5k. Hurt. It felt stupid the whole time. For a brief moment I was sold a play from someone but really it felt idiotic. It felt like gambling. And I know crypto should feel like gambling but it just doesn‚Äôt. A lot of people really believe in their crypto. Hodling isn‚Äôt just a meme it‚Äôs a lifestyle. Made 40% on half my life savings with crypto in less than a month and only lost money with WSB a community that prides itself in losing money. Crypto is the future. I feel comfortable holding cause I believe in it. Fuck all y‚Äôall."
2021-04-15 00:11:54,wallstreetbets,YOLO DOGE...oh good god lol
2021-04-15 00:39:02,wallstreetbets,as an ETH holder and OG wsber I am very happy.

All because I lost my magical internet currency."

2021-04-15 01:05:22,wallstreetbets,"Doge? Why? That is a joke coin. 

Theta is a sleeping giant that will take the market by surprise. It is the only one doing what it is doing. Decentralization of streaming service with involvement from sony, samsung, lions gate, google and counting. With advisors like youtube and twitch founders. Want to make money yolo theta. I dont even own bitcoin or eth because the growth potential is huge with theta. Read more at thetatoken.org and thank me later.

Also, i only started to invest in crypto when i read about theta and was quickly sold."
2021-04-15 01:07:27,wallstreetbets,Comparing it to penny stocks makes me think you don't understand the technology.

2021-04-15 01:53:23,wallstreetbets,Well done! Does this start tomorrow?
2021-04-15 03:04:54,wallstreetbets,Why only btc eth doge? There sre a lot of good crypto projects out there ( and even more scams). Maybe limiting discussion to the top 50 crypto would be better.
2021-04-15 03:10:14,wallstreetbets,I can‚Äôt wait to buy COIN below $200

Money printer, federal reserve,  ect.  It does not matter,  because I can't walk into the supermarket and pay with crypto.  So it isn't a currency,  its something else. A bond speculative investment in the hope that the value rises so you can sell it on to some chump who will pay $50k, $80k or $100k on it? 

Fuck off."

2021-04-15 00:21:19,wallstreetbets,"Lmfao DOGE COIN?? This post coincides with Coinbase IPO, and DOGE isn't even on CB. Why not permit discussion of all crypto listed on CB? I imagine they all have an impact on the price of COIN"

2021-04-14 22:42:05,wallstreetbets,"Bitcoin and Etherium, sure.  I don't understand why would you allow discussing DOGE, but not actual legitimate altcoins?  What's the logic there?  Are the mods who decided this just disconnected from crypto?"

2021-04-15 05:05:21,wallstreetbets,Wait why doge? Of all the altcoins we pick a meme coin that has no new technology and no future? Thats not going to be the one that overtakes bitcoin or eth or does any kind of serious business.
2021-04-15 06:48:16,wallstreetbets,"This is welcome, but I wonder what's the reasoning for limiting only to BTC, ETH, and DOGE? Surely that's completely against the spirit of this sub, which is about finding opportunities, DD in obscure stocks, etc. Why not just open it up to all crypto?"

2021-04-15 01:34:00,wallstreetbets,"Of the 100s of altcoins and shitcoins to choose from, how is DOGE one of the only 3 coins you picked..?"
2021-04-15 02:01:34,wallstreetbets,Thanks for embracing and opening up to crypto. You will definitely profit from this development
2021-04-15 02:49:47,wallstreetbets,Good choice.

2021-04-15 10:50:26,wallstreetbets,Nonsense
2021-04-14 20:11:07,wallstreetbets,Doge isn't on Coinbase.
2021-04-14 21:50:38,wallstreetbets,Yup. Which is total trash because I had been told and laughed at so many times when I spoke about DOGE here and there back in November (on an old account). Now they wanna allow it when it‚Äôs flying. I‚Äôm quite happy with my 900% return that‚Äôs so ‚Äúunstable‚Äù. Ive lost more on stocks and I‚Äôm NEVER turning back. I‚Äôm sticking to crypto.
2021-04-14 20:11:17,wallstreetbets,They must hold Doge
2021-04-14 20:24:15,wallstreetbets,No ripple?!!

Gonna be fortune 500 one day watch it happen. Hopefully it dips hard so I can jump in without having to borrow money from my wife's second cousin.
2021-04-15 07:58:40,wallstreetbets,Right now they allow it since it affects them now how convenient. After all those time they told me not to post about crypto.

We shall see if the stock market casino crony BS will lead people here to understand how bitcoin solves the problems in society, or if a skeumorphic perspective will be taken, looking for the next casino section.

2021-04-15 04:16:01,wallstreetbets,I've made more in crypto in the last three weeks than in stocks in the last three years. It's insane and the stock market sucks balls.

2021-04-14 21:33:35,wallstreetbets,"The problem with you stonk boys is youre thinking of crypto like stocks.

There are zero fundamentals or earnings in crypto.

Crypto is more akin to land, either it has resources, or location, or bothn

Crypto are traded on two things: tech and hype.

That's it.


What does the coin or token do better than other coins, and is it popular?


They are popular for different reasons, but they need to be popular first, and have good tech second.


In doge's case, unlike ether, you can exchange it for goods and services essentially free, like money.

That's its tech.  Free exchange, so great case use.

Then its got a meme dog on it.  So popular.

Perfect storm.


Now in my personal opinion, litecoin is better for this type of tech and faster, which is why paypal uses it, but it isnt as flashy, so it lacks the hype.  It also IS limited in coins issued, so i do see this becoming the digital silver."
2021-04-14 20:43:47,wallstreetbets,They have a lot of power here so I think it will be a wild ride whatever happens.

All the extra potential was explored a little later as people considered what a blockchain might be capable of.

The more common use cases you describe were the disappointing ""hey, the real world called"".

Bitcoin is a currency.. it‚Äôs not supposed to constantly change on a fundamental level... just improve as a network. Why don‚Äôt you go take a look at the hash rate over time and let me know if network security has improved. 

Bitcoin‚Äôs integration into our financial infrastructure is deliberately gradual. That is why it will take over 120 years for all Bitcoin to be mined. It has been what 12 years since the genesis block? 

Plus, what kind of argument is that? If you had invested in 2011 you‚Äôd be up hand over fist right now. They‚Äôre called ‚Äòmarket cycles‚Äô not hype bubbles, and if you were half as intelligent as you think you‚Äôd be rich right now because they are easy as fuck to predict. 

The fact that people are even still trying to make these arguments is assurance that Satoshi knew what he was doing when he wrote the halving into the Bitcoin protocol. People need time to palate these types of changes. It‚Äôs a decentralized peer-to-peer network - it‚Äôs the future. Wake up."

If someone buys an out of the money call when the volatility is low and am instant later the volatility increases sharply (just to try to keep all other things equal) you'll see a corresponding price increase. The option can then be sold for profit. In this case you are only trading volatility.

Why would someone buy the call? As you said because they expect it to be in the money, or, they expect volatility to jump and still be able to sell the call for profit. Or they need to hedge."
2021-04-14 20:04:29,wallstreetbets,The gains come from the premiums rising and falling (i.e. the likelihood of the strike price being met or exceeded)

*You must see all the images to understand my DD, I don't know why reddit messed up my formatting*

# Bear points:

1. The moat is not necessarily the strongest, management has to continually deliver to keep on growing. I am fairly confident that they can do it. But you may not be.

2. Too conservative management. You can easily see this from their non-existent debt and huge cash position.

3. Too low volume. Float is also only 18M. Options bid-ask spread is wild.

**Common question: Why did the stock drop so much in 2019 and stuff?**

Answer: They had an exclusivity deal with USPS where they got a lot of money for that deal. But management intentionally dropped it as USPS couldn't make 2 day delivery or the fast delivery requirements that is necessary to compete.

The market reacted very badly for this short-term bump in the road. But COVID-19 has proved that management was right all along and it was absolutely necessary to drop that deal to grow the company.

**Conclusion:** I think the stock will pretty reliably beat the upcoming earning and the stock will jump heavily before the earnings only to dump a little or a lot after the earnings. Basically, buy the rumour, sell... However, the stock is also a pretty decent one for long term holdings too.

**TL;DR: STMP will at least reach $270+ before earnings come out. My crystal ball says so.**"
2021-04-15 06:04:47,wallstreetbets,I think you are right but the premiums are fking high and the spread is disgusting on calls. Might jump if the stock drops a bit. But the puts for later is a for sure.

2021-04-15 07:34:14,wallstreetbets,"A simplified way to think about this:

Selling a covered call is like setting a limit sell on your shares that you own. The strike price is basically the limit sell price. The difference is, when you sell a covered call, you get paid a ‚Äúpremium‚Äù up front that puts extra money in your pocket.

OP is bummed because (1) the ‚Äúvalue‚Äù of the covered call has gone down - that‚Äôs actually fine, it means they sold it at a higher value than it is now worth. (2) they think the ‚Äúlimit sell‚Äù (or strike price) may be hit, forcing them to sell these shares and they actually want to hold on to the shares."
2021-04-15 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"New SEC filing from IEX seeking to overhaul and improve fairness in executing trades for retail investors. Unpublished and scheduled to drop tomorrow. This will close several loopholes that market makers and HF have over retail investors for all trades routed to IEX.

[https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2021-07676.pdf](https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2021-07676.pdf)

The purpose of the proposed rule change is to enhance the Exchange‚Äôs Retail Price Improvement Program for the **benefit of retail investors.** Specifically, the Exchange proposes to make the following four changes: (i) revise the definition of Retail order in IEX Rule 11.190(b)(15) to **apply only to the trading interest of a natural person that does not place more than 390 equity orders per day** on average during a calendar month for its own beneficial account(s);7 (ii) **provide Order Book8 priority to Retail Liquidity Provider (‚ÄúRLP‚Äù) orders9 at the Midpoint Price10 ahead of other non-displayed orders priced to execute at the Midpoint Price;** (iii) disseminate a ‚ÄúRetail Liquidity Identifier‚Äù through the Exchange‚Äôs proprietary market data feeds and the appropriate securities information processor (‚ÄúSIP‚Äù) when RLP order interest aggregated to form at least one round lot for a particular security is available in the System,11 provided that the RLP order interest is resting at the Midpoint Price and is **priced at least $0.001 better than the NBB12 or NBO13**; and (iv) amend the definition of RLP orders so **such orders can only be midpoint peg orders**,14 cannot be Discretionary Peg orders,15 and cannot include a minimum quantity restriction.16 The proposed changes are designed to further support and enhance the ability of non-professional retail investors to obtain meaningful price improvement by incentivizing market participants to compete to provide such price improvement.

Retail Liquidity Provider means a broker that routes retail orders through the IEX. You can call your broker and see if they are an RLP for IEX.

Read some of the DD to learn a bit on how **non displayed orders** are likely being used by citadel and friends to manipulate the price.

Overall, it seems like a major step in the right direction to help level the playing field. It looks like it has to go through the traditional comment period before approval. (Not an advance notice).

TL;DR: This completely negates the ability for other firms to see retail orders before execution and then act accordingly to manipulate the price. This would give retail orders **Priority over other non-displayed orders. It would also force the broker to enter the trade at the midpoint price (Ie between ask and bid). Previously, this could be manipulated to decrease the price by consistently filling orders at lower and lower prices so that even though people are buying, the price drops.**

Still reading will add more as needed.

Edit: moved some things around and added TL;DR"

2021-04-14 21:32:53,wallstreetbets,"Yes exactly, you are right about when your get fill.  That's adverse selection.

This helps avoid adverse selection.   If you did it yourself with a script, you would still get your standing limit orders picked off because they are displayed.  Also you would just be way too slow; this is why the HFTs pay the big bucks to have a  direct connection to the exchange (except IEX).  They want to pick your order off before you can change it.

You should also look into the D-peg order if you are concerned about adverse selection.

By the way, neither of these order types are new.  You can use them with IBKR Pro, and probably several other brokers as well (though I don't know which ones)"

I _specifically_ avoided any theories as to _how_ they might drive down the price. But you ignored that condition, went on a rant, and implied that I'm stupid. Poor show man.

I will say it again - In the case where a MM is shorted on a stock, and there exists _some method_, legal or illegal, which might allow them to theoretically lower the price, they have an incentive to do so because the gains from driving the price down _could be_ orders of magnitude more than they'd make by fleecing you a bit more."

2021-04-14 23:02:12,wallstreetbets,"Just because a trade executes at a certain price didn't mean that there's any more liquidity at that price.  What your are suggesting just wouldn't work.

This doesn't require a market maker.  Anyone with money can plow through the order book and bid up the price of a stock, taking out all the asks.  It's not even hard to do; it just takes money.  But that doesn't mean that they will be able to turn around and sell all their shares at that new elevated price, because the only person willing to pay that much is them.

You see this all the time.  There is a large order in some stock and the price spikes (up or down) on relativity high volume.  And then a minute later it's back to where it was before.

""Lowering the price"" does not help them because ""the price"" is just the last price that it was traded at, not the next price that it will trade at.  In order for them to be able to buy back at that new, lower price there has to be a seller (other than them) at that price.  And if there is such a seller, then they didn't need to ""lower the price"" in the first place.

This idea that taking the wrong side of a trade is somehow profitable is just insane.  It's the exact opposite of how MMs make money."

If a MM wants to print lower prices that's easy enough to do.  Any MM who pays for order flow can fill your bids at as low as a price as they want.  Their only regulatory restriction is that they not go above the best published ask.  There is no rule about how low they can go because, well, that would be a stupid rule.

Filling your buy orders at a lower price than the current bid is not illegal.  It's just really, really stupid, so they don't do it."

Then they usually sell a few days later once things stop being exciting and everyone screams hedge fund attack when its just people taking profits.

This is similar to the behavior in March where the earnings dip recovered on mass buying of calls into April at strikes priced $50 apart all the way up to 800c. Market makers got reloaded today, and will happily be willing to play out May like April - slow bleeds on IV to get the premiums, and slow sell off of shares at a profit."

2021-04-15 10:26:47,wallstreetbets,"He could have, and then the stock could have dropped back to $4 and he would lose a lot of money.  
  
Or he buys the option contract, and if the price goes up, he exercises and gains the stock for cheap compared to the current price. If the price goes down, he doesn't have to exercise (buy the shares) and only loses the amount of money he paid for the options contracts.  
  
It's basically a risk management sorta thing. Are you willing to YOLO it all into the stock now, uncertain of the future, or are you willing to take out an options contract in the hope that the stock price will rise?   
  
AFAIK, he paid about $8k for the options contracts. And now he bought 4200 $160 shares for $25 a piece because of those contracts.
  
So basically, risk $8k for potential profits in the future, or YOLO all you have right now for potential profits in the future. He made a smart decision. And it paid off big time."

2021-04-14 21:27:35,wallstreetbets,"I've got 80 shares left but wish I kept 100 to do this. Was considering buying another 20 to have enough, but price spiked today. Cost avg is $50"

What?"
2021-04-14 20:07:49,wallstreetbets,U have 300 shares? Holy shit
2021-04-15 01:27:16,wallstreetbets,500 ? what strike?
2021-04-14 22:16:38,wallstreetbets,"Even if the counter-party has the shares, they‚Äôre lent out. If I was the counter-party, delusionally expecting this to work out in my favor, I wouldn‚Äôt buy the shares until the last possible second. I‚Äôd be hoping the price drops 80% tomorrow and I save all that money."
2021-04-15 10:38:39,wallstreetbets,"You‚Äôre right I should‚Äôve worded it better. The hedged shares are probably lent, so exercise still results in buying pressure, assuming that means they call shares from borrower to pass to buyer (unless they‚Äôre honoring contracts w foofoo thin air shares)"
2021-04-14 20:08:56,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, that's why I sold today and planned on exercising on Friday.  But immediately after the sale it was in the available cash category not in the unsettled funds so I used it"
2021-04-14 20:10:10,wallstreetbets,A margin account will soak up the GF violation as well.
2021-04-14 20:01:15,wallstreetbets,"nothing, youre spot on. I think he said he bought these in October 2020, The share price would have been about $11 at the time. He bet GME would more than double which makes those calls WAY otm at the time.  (not to mention he was betting itd hit a 5 year high @ $25) during a pandemic, with terrible fundamentals, mass layoffs, and while closing down shops left and right. 

Its almost like if you bought $2000.00 TSLA calls tomorrow that expire in 6 months, only the GME play was alot more farfetched because TSLA is in alot better shape as a company than GME was. It was a ridiculous play. GME is the furthest thing from normal you can possibly imagine, and by regular standards one wouldnt expect calls like that to have printed in a gazillion years.

We are used to seeing wild price action NOW since memestocks went mainstream, but normal stocks dont go up 150% in 6 months. like ever. Let alone the shit GME has been up to."
2021-04-15 00:28:56,wallstreetbets,"If you‚Äôre just buying a put or call option outright, which I believe OP did, your buying power isn‚Äôt affected by how much the option is out of the money on day to day basis. You‚Äôre only out the $8,400, meaning that‚Äôs how much you‚Äôll lose if the option expires worthless."
2021-04-14 23:32:20,wallstreetbets,"First off, great explanatory post. Upvoted. I wish I had run into your post breaking options down before sinking 2h into it. Thanks for the reply 

I meant I was surprised for such a good run down your post didn't go into the concept of potentially selling the contract for higher profits, with the right timing, rather than exercising the contract to obtain the shares. Unless I missed that part!"
2021-04-15 07:40:14,wallstreetbets,"Oh yeah, I forgot. Stonks only go up."
2021-04-15 07:46:03,wallstreetbets,I started out with only only three. I wasn't smart enough to know better and somehow wound up with 300.
2021-04-15 07:44:23,wallstreetbets,Currently  they are April 16th @ $195. This is just above my cost basis. If my GME shares survive this week I will sell new calls on Monday morning. Each week I do this it effectively drives down my cost basis.
2021-04-14 20:02:27,wallstreetbets,"FUCK YEA, I want him to be right!"
2021-04-14 23:35:42,wallstreetbets,Yeah I got a margin account
2021-04-15 15:36:17,wallstreetbets,I think he's talking about the money needed to exercise them.

2021-04-14 22:57:36,wallstreetbets,Options. Each contract is worth 100 shares. The ‚Äúpremium price‚Äù listed - 7 and 14 are per share in the contract so he bought these for approx. 70k and he doubled his money as the premium for these appreciated due to decrease in value of the stock.

2021-04-15 11:11:23,wallstreetbets,Yes!!! Now only if more people would read this. HYLN is going to be a winner and the manipulation needs to be stopped. This price level and pessimism is completely unwarranted
2021-04-15 11:17:50,wallstreetbets,In for 100 @ $9.37 and coming weekend I will figure out why.....
2021-04-15 12:58:05,wallstreetbets,"I have been invested in HYLN since July last year when it was SHLL and trading for $23. I averaged in down to $19 before it shot to the moon a few weeks later and hit $58. I didn‚Äôt sell most of my shares but since I was averaging in, I had a significant portion on the sidelines. So I put most of that in at 45 and rode it through the merger. After it started its free fall I bought even more at 29, more at 19, more at 17, 16 and 12 and 11, now 10 and 9. This is the story of how I keep averaging into this great company in hopes that investors will return in a year or two and pay me back for my faith. 

My shares, 15,522 shares average of $30.45.... what hurt me the most is having over 5,500 shares at 45 and 46.50. This company will go on to be successful and the share price will reflect that. I can wait. I don‚Äôt need any of this money any time soon. It does still hurt to see such a bloody ugly mess though."

Today we do things on the internet by means of social influencing. 
This maybe needs a more older world solution. 

Select key persons in key trucking networks to receive a promotional truck mod for a year or 3 with warranty. If that‚Äôs too expensive have a raffle to help mitigate some of the expense. They‚Äôll spend much more money in advertising and high powered sales pitches than doing this. Let end user experiences told at meetings and rest stops be your salesforce .

Produce a trucker reality tv show (not on ice roads) using only hyliion gear. Make sure there are plenty of scenes showing how far they travel and how easy and fast it is to ‚Äúgas up.‚Äù"

2021-04-14 22:28:51,wallstreetbets,"Your quotation marks in addition to the anon monikers seem to imply that you do not believe either of those examples to exist.

The phenomena of the so called short ladder attacks are officially termed as ""Wash Trades,"" and these Wash Trades have been historically used to manipulate the prices of securities: 

investopediacom/terms/w/washtrading.asp 

wikipediaorg/wiki/Wash\_trade

Whether or not Wash Trades are being used to manipulate GME's price is yet to be proven with concrete evidence, but currently the majority of GME's transactions seem to be handled by Citadel Securities, a Market Maker which has has in the past been fined for engaging in Wash Trading on top of a history of regulatory violations:

files.brokercheck.finraorg/firm/firm\_116797.pdf

This particular document contains accounts of 59 separate violations which have resulted in fines, an amount that implies Citadel Securities doesn't seem to be particularly concerned with strict adherence to regulations.

As far as ""hiding their shorts"" is concerned, there have been numerous documented accounts of unusual call-option trading activity where a thus far unidentified entity has been purchasing tens of millions of dollars worth of deep ITM call contracts on a weekly basis; personally, I doubt anyone with such large amounts of capital would engage in these unnecessarily costly transactions for earnest investing purposes, but you are free to disagree, I'm sure that if you do you'll have some convincing reason(s) to do so and I hope to see these reason(s) presented if you continue to insist on this rhetoric of conspiratorial lunacy.

I am by no means attempting to claim that these or other *potentially* *fraudulent* activities occuring in relation to GME securities are definitive proof of illegal stock-price manipulation, but as it stands, the fact that there *are* numerous highly unusual activities taking place in relation to GME securities creates legitimate room for discussion as to whether or not these activities may be fraudulent in nature, and I do not believe that it is unreasonable, nor a sign of paranoid madness to engage in these discussions.

I cannot attest as to whether or not HYLN securities are involved in potential securities fraud as OP seems to imply, but I'll say that it seems somewhat hypocritical to dismiss a high amount of unusual trading activity in relation to GME securities as ""conspiracy theories,"" and then go on to attempting to claim that securities fraud is occuring due to a potential miss-valuation, along with evidence of someone telling people that HYLN stock is bad, especially when considering that the latter has been observed on numerous occasions on several different GME discussing platforms."

Haha, okay well go ask the majority of the colonised world how they feel about this, lol.

You're asking me if men were 'strictly' the hunters? I don't even know what to say to that. It's a level of ignorance here that is astounding. Science shows women are higher in empathy and men have better stamina, tracking skills, and sense of direction. This is from a hormonal mix that goes back millions of years and serves the same purpose in all animals. You are asking woke 19-year-old questions. There's a normal curve of human capability. Women could hunt, but it's a waste of their talents.

Lastly, the coup de grace - do you think Native Americans lacked psychopaths? It's borderline racist that you are imagining them as some sort of happy-go-lucky tribe people that were destroyed by capitalism. They would raid and slaughter each other. And just like in Europeans, being able to control who and what they were empathic towards served them in intertribal relationships. Given a tech advantage, they would have brutally subjugated and enslaved the Europeans.

As I stated previously, it is quite obvious that capitalism was won through sheer militarised force and to characterise it as winning because it most 'adequately satisfied the demands of most people' is categorically false. Hence, the need to take the majority of the colonised world into the equation. Did capitalism meet their demands? Well no, and that's why they fought so vehemently against it and why the US has staged countless overthrows of democratically-elected governments across the world and continues to prop-up foreign backed dictators.

This is an edited academic volume that challenges the notion that ""women could hunt but it wasn't their primary role evolutionarily,"" and it's published by a scholarly press. Every article is written by a different expert that use different approaches from across a variety of disciplines to dismantle the dated view that you continue to proffer.

Basically, these academics from across disciplines have determined that your dated view of 'evolutionary gender roles' is erreronous and have formed a new scholarly consensus. Now if you want to link evidence that supports your own assertion you can go right ahead; however, I've noticed to date that you've only chosen to present your personal opinions without supporting evidence; that's just not good enough in the real world. 

I also included popular articles that take these academic findings and write them in a way that's more understandable to a layperson's perspective. I enjoyed reading both varieties.

Sounds like you decided not to read anything posted though. Nothing I can do about that and I'm pretty sure the world will continue to move on as normal whether you understand these issues or not."

No response about Bezos, Musk, Carnegie, Rockefeller, or the abundance of scientific lit on psychopaths as CEOs. Harping on this woman thing because women have a lower rate of psychopathy but you think because a woman once gutted a rabbit in history you are correct. Why are more men CEOs than women?

This all stemmed from your initial statement:

>Being a psychopath/sociopath has served and continues to serve an important evolutionary purpose.

This is the crux of the issue so please focus on this. Yeah I agree that psychopaths can rise to the top of the capitalist/corporate order (never denied that), but the crux of the issue which you have not supported is whether you can *prove that psychopathic tendencies serve evolutionary purposes.*

Can you provide links to academic data that supports this statement directly?

2021-04-15 11:47:34,wallstreetbets,"The fact that they continue to exist proves the point, though. Otherwise natural selection would have gotten rid of the trait. What's obvious is that psychopaths are useful. You think they are simply mentally ill, which to me implies you think we are at the end point of evolution.

2021-04-15 12:02:15,wallstreetbets,"These are interesting papers, particularly the first one. Unfortunately none of them support your statement:

>Being a psychopath/sociopath has served and continues to serve an important evolutionary purpose.

Correct me if I'm wrong and just cite the specific paragraphs/lines that support this statement from the papers; however, I did not find them. I can move on with the supposition that your statement is true because it also raises interesting points.

For the sake of argument let's pretend that in the past psychopathy could serve an evolutionary purpose. How would that 'purpose' differ within kin-based modes of production (First Nations) that were less binary and more web-like, versus the 'purpose' of a capital-driven mode of production that at its core depends on the harsh exploitation of human labour?

Given the above questions, you can see how I am coming at this from a sociological perspective after all, since it seems prudent to analyse how different societies (based on different mode of production) promote or inhibit the proliferation of psychopathic trends. At this point, it's perfectly reasonable to accept that kin-ordered societies used cultural means to limit psychopathic tendencies, whereas state-centered/capitalist-ordered societies promote them.

In terms of slums, it's not a red herring because slum creation does not exist beside capitalism but is an integral component of it; in this vein, as we proceed into a late-stage capitalism the proliferation of slums across the world (and now seeping into the heartland of the American Empire) are a core component of the capital-accumulation process that is reaching more and more crisis points."
2021-04-15 12:09:21,wallstreetbets,"> Science shows women are higher in empathy and men have better stamina, tracking skills, and sense of direction.

>There's a normal curve of human capability. 

Can you provide supporting evidence for these statements?

You did mention that you're not interested in reading my sources, and to be fair the sources go into rich detail explaining why your 'hormonal mix determines gender roles in prehistory' argument is just not valid.

But like I said, I'm willing to look at the supporting evidence that supports your above two assertations.

Can you provide that?"
2021-04-15 12:06:59,wallstreetbets,"In the real work we don't just google a bunch of terms and use the search engine results as support evidence.

Obviously it's important to read the results, analyse them and them point to specific paragraphs/arguments that support the statement.

You made the statement and if you cannot provide the supporting evidence that's fine."
2021-04-15 12:07:54,wallstreetbets,"Do you have any proof there were less psychopaths in kin-ordered societies? Surely there were plenty of venues for them to express psychopathy everyday, especially in tribal warfare. The assumption that psychopaths don't have lasting family kin bonds is off base too. https://www.intechopen.com/books/psychopathy-new-updates-on-an-old-phenomenon/the-impact-of-psychopathy-on-the-family

2021-04-15 12:12:39,wallstreetbets,"> Do you have any proof there were less psychopaths in kin-ordered societies?

I think the line of thinking is that the societies were more redistributive than capitalism, and therefore it would be interesting to know how psychopathic tendencies (or even just hoarding tendencies) were limited by cultural means.

This is a great place to start: https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780865476387

We do have a fairly good understanding of the cultural means used to promote redistribution vs accumulation that leaders to the formation of social classes (and rigid inequality).

>Psychopaths occur in every society throughout human history and any belief otherwise is incorrect. They usually rise to leadership positions.

Yes I'm sure they do; hence the question: why do some kin-ordered societies have the ability to limit this individual behaviour whereas capitalism seems to encourage it? 

It's a supremely interesting question, and I appreciate your dialogue for helping me think through them."
2021-04-15 12:16:54,wallstreetbets,"> I don't see how you can debate empirical neuroscience with pottery but here we are.

That's a reductionism and if you want to make this claim then you need to explain why it's valid. Obviously it's not, and overlooks the richness of my examples (which you don't really engage with but still dismiss).

>Brody lauds hunter-gatherers' values, generosity, mutual respect, and use of language. For example, Inuktitut people make no distinctions according to gender and have grammars in which male or female is irrelevant. Brody, and this reviewer, are fascinated by the hunter-gatherers' ability to live for and in present time and their apparent ""porosity,"" that is, the ability to traverse mentally between natural and supernatural realms (e.g., shamanism) while hunting game, gathering plants, and telling stories with a purpose (e.g. creation myth). These peoples seek not to change the world, but to know the signs, cycles, transformations, and implicit rules in their world.

From the review: https://www.curledup.com/eden.htm

Look to page 31 for this in the author's own words about the 'anti-authoritarian' nature of Inuit society:

https://books.google.ca/books?id=rXCqBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false

We don't need to agree, we just need to dialogue ‚Äì and we did that.

Thanks for the back-and-forth and enjoy the rest of your day."

This is more exhaustive and sourced then I can be, to how psychopathy evolved, how feelings and instincts evolved, what purpose they serve, the triune brain, fight-flight and threat detection, reptilian brain structures, amygdala regulation, epigenetic maternal influence, phobic triggers for anger and fear that have ancient roots in a negative affect regulation system, different biological strategies, risk taking behavior, etc. I'm reading it at work and it's truly fascinating and I appreciate you making me do a little digging for this.

>Several authors argue that some toxic
experiences in early childhood (with recurrent and intense SRS activation - signaling extrinsic
morbidity‚Äìmortality and environmental unpredictability) may trigger a shifting toward a faster life
history strategy, facilitating the emergence of psychopathic traits (Del Giudice et al., 2013; Ellis et
al., 2013; Glenn et al, 2011). In fact, in severely harsh social contexts, engaging in high levels of
risk taking (e.g., antagonistic competition, impulsivity) can be the more adaptive response (i.e.,
fitness-maximizing) from an evolutionary perspective. Low stress responsivity may also help
individuals to reinforce their resilience to internalizing disorders in stressful environments and to maintain calm and vigilance during hostile interactions. These strategies require an unresponsive
SRS, or a higher threshold to threats, dangers, and social feedback, which is an advantage for the
extreme risk-taker and for an exploitative person (Del Guidice et al., 2011; Ellis et al., 2013)
>To some extent, these data point toward a potential evolutionary root for psychopathy, i.e.,
the development and maintenance of psychopathic traits, and the low stress responsivity behind
those traits could be seen as a possible adaptive strategy to deal with highly threatening
environments. Nevertheless, as stated, an adaptive response and reproductive success is not
equivalent to psychological well-being or socially valued outcomes. Furthermore, although
psychopathy could have some benefits to the individual itself, it is indeed a condition with many
societal and individual costs that, therefore, signals a need for intervention."

Assuming they sustain a revenue growth of 126% (meaning they get to \~2.9 billion revenue), and expenses stay where they are right now (roughly 800mill), we're looking at a very optimistic PE ratio of approximately \~50 for the year.

But then again, Tesla had 1k+ PE ratio and it didn't stop anyone. Just depends where people see Coinbase's business model going I guess"

You: wha....

2021-04-14 21:05:33,wallstreetbets,"At expiration they will automatically exercise. Depending on the brokerage, they may immediately sell those shares at market and you get the difference, probably minus some interest. They may put it on margin, wherein he gets charged interest until he covers the margin. As far as I'm aware, an expired in the money contract must be exercised at close. 

This is why cash covered calls/puts exist. The potential purchase cost is held in escrow during the life of the contract, that way no margin is needed."
2021-04-14 22:34:55,wallstreetbets,"Thank you for the detailed answer! 

Is there a way to tell which brokerage takes the approach of immediately selling those shares, when the option is exercised due to lack of buyers, and then you get the difference versus the brokers that put it on margin? It seems to me the former scenario is less risky, from my beginner perspective (as someone that doesnt know much about margin)."

2021-04-14 22:31:15,wallstreetbets,"yea ok keep believing that then while the other guy leverages what he has, works harder than you, and goes much farther.   good luck with the other crabs down there in the barrel"
2021-04-15 07:19:43,wallstreetbets,"I'd imagine you'd have to dig through their terms of service. Most big brokerages require you to apply for options trading so this isn't a problem, since you need to be approved for margin and without it they require the option to be cash covered. This might actually be a use for reading Robinhoods ToS since they will automatically attempt to sell the contract if you can't cover. 

I only have level 2 options trading through etrade, so I simply cannot make trades without collateral."
2021-04-14 23:31:12,wallstreetbets,I understand your point and agree some of us will never become multi-millionaires no matter how hard we work due to our lack of connections or pedigree. I will never be able to have FU money or be able to pick out the color of my lambo but that's okay. My parents started over with practically nothing and thanks to them I'll be able to semi-retire by 40 if I choose to. This is something I never imagined possible and I only hope that my kids can become even more successful than I am.
2021-04-14 23:09:56,wallstreetbets,"Lmao ok, I probably work harder then most of you. 14-16 hours days growing my business by thousands a month and evenings at a warehouse $20 an hour to get my ass in shape and get paid to do it.

I‚Äôll stay here living in it."
2021-04-14 21:58:23,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm not trying to trivialize anything. I‚Äôve been working the better part of my life now and have seen my family members struggle my whole life. 

And yeah sorry but my solution to injustices is the solution that‚Äôs been used throughout history. Air them out. They damn sure don‚Äôt get fixed by ignoring them. Why is it an issue to point out injustices? If everyone knows then what‚Äôs the issue in pointing it out so others don‚Äôt feel like shit when they don‚Äôt win?  Of course we could talk about material solutions like taxing wealthy people and advocating for more social safety nets so more people do actually get opportunities, but like you said this is wsb and even just bringing up the injustices upsets people like you.

If telling a subreddit full of gamblers that they deserve more out of life than wishing to one day be rich is a scary crusade that upsets you then I think you have some self reflection to do. How are you going to act surprised and upset when kids in a gambling subreddit start getting tired of being told they can all be millionaires, when you guys keep admitting, life‚Äôs not fair and we won‚Äôt all be millionaires?

Talking about how ‚Äúyou‚Äôre just toxic‚Äù when someone is trying to rationalize why some on this sub win big while others never get a chance is like getting surprised when other people at the casino are a bit jealous you just got a blackjack on a $10,000 hand.

Not everyone consents your ‚Äúcrusade‚Äù of coming in here and convincing everyone they can work hard and invest into a millionaire. Some of us just wanna gamble and bitch."

But in the same year those 200,000 people got richer from their savings, 20 million others lost their jobs.

2021-04-14 21:08:18,wallstreetbets,Yeah I just respectfully think this is bullshit. I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything inherently better about rich humans.
2021-04-14 23:56:08,wallstreetbets,"This recession and its subsequent recovery have impacted different people very differently. Everyone knows it basically decimated those making less than $40K/year especially in the hospitality and restaurant business but barely touched those in the tech sector. While the initial impact differs from 2008 recession its recovery is eerily similar in that the rich got richer and the poor stayed the same.

In 2008, the upper class that was heavily invested in the market saw the most loss but also the most gain subsequently when the economy rebounded. Their income rose significantly compared to the bottom 99%, something like 31% vs 0.4% from 2009 to 2012, along with their assets. This is essentially where we are at now. It sucks for those that was negatively impacted the most but this isn't without precedence. The world has never been fair and will never be.

Also, the gain porn on this sub unfortunately bring about a lot of envy and cause people to take on huge risks. I've paid more than my share of options tuition as have others. Some of them didn't have to work for their money but I'd wager a large number of degenerate gamblers here actually did."

Best case scenario... you‚Äôre a multimillionaire.  

Worst case scenario... your downside risk is $165 and you own a share of a company in the early stages of an e-commerce transformation with name brand recognition, top tier executives, and a established market position in a growing industry.  Nothing else in the market (which is increasingly looking like a bubble) offers even remotely the same upside.  And GME‚Äôs negative beta position in relation to the rest of the market could allow you to consider it as a hedge.  Buy it as a lottery ticket on the bet it‚Äôll squeeze, an investment in fundamentals, a ‚Äúfuck you‚Äù towards the system, etc.  Whatever your reason, why would you NOT buy at least 1 share at this point?

Imagine you're at the casino playing your favorite table. You love this table. You never lose at this table. At least you've never lost before. But now you are losing, at your favorite table, losing bad. This can't be. Your running out of on hand money but you NEED to double down.
So you reach for a note pad and start drawing money shapes on a napkin. The casino takes your napkin and lets you keep playing but you still keep losing but now you're out of napkins and nobody lets you borrow their pen anymore. You still refuse to pack up so you start writing notes in fecal matter on tattered shreds of clothes you're removing. The casino takes your shitty notes because they like money but you're starting to run out of clothes and fecal matter.  Sure you could have settled your debts and gone home but you NEVER lose. It's your casino and you control the cash flow but still you're naked and coverd in shit.  The casino isn't actually yours and you still have to honor the shitty notes you've literally pulled out of your ass.

I went to the [SEC.gov](https://SEC.gov) site and checked the EDGAR filings on GME.... it has just shy of 70M shares out... without the POSSIBLE 3.5M....

For simple calcs, I did some rounding.....

70M - 21.25% for the insiders (14.875M) = 55.125M is the float.

55.125M \* 140% of the float owned by institutions = 77M shares

So.... from there... if every ape on here owns just 1 share... that's 87M shares and there's only supposed to be 55.125M

So... there's almost 58% shares out there that shouldn't be. :)"

If the strike price is lower than the current stock price, the person selling the call would need to own 100 shares to cover each call. So every time you buy a call, some HF buys up 100 shares to cover, thus driving the price higher.

If you‚Äôre buying calls that are like $200 strike or way OTM, the person selling doesn‚Äôt need to own the underlying shares until stock price moves above $200. As long as they keep the price below, they profit off your purchase.

Now there are some nuances and shitty rules like some big MM have 6 days to cover, but I don‚Äôt really know enough to explain so I‚Äôll keep it simple"

Ok.... so... I did a happy little check on things....

I went to the [SEC.gov](https://sec.gov/) site and checked the EDGAR filings on GME.... it has just shy of 70M shares out... without the POSSIBLE 3.5M....

For simple calcs, I did some rounding.....

70M - 21.25% for the insiders (14.875M) = 55.125M is the float.

55.125M \* 140% of the float owned by institutions = 77M shares

So.... from there... if every ape on here owns just 1 share... that's 87M shares and there's only supposed to be 55.125M

So... there's almost 58% shares out there that shouldn't be. :)

Here's an interesting thing on top of the above:  That's not including Options!!!!  There's going to be a lot of angst at the Griffin home in the future."

2021-04-15 00:01:07,wallstreetbets,"So you blew up 8.5k. Comes with the territory. What matters is what you do from here.

I blew up 35k after making 40k off GME. Learned a lot, I'm not giving up. Just make 1 call at time, make sure its the one you want, maybe try a long term one. (Pltr?)

Anyways, sorry you feel down. Others, including myself - have lost much more and have still managed to be happy and sometimes redeemed!\~

I, personally, am waiting for redemption financially after blowing money on calls, like you. But I'm still happy since I'm 100 days sober today, never knew about investing 6 months ago, and see so much opportunity. Do longer, safer calls or shares. Impatience may be the biggest threat to investors. I made 40k from 2.5k and blew it all trying to turn it into 100k by a date and borrowing other's $ to try and help them. (So overambitious / impatient of me, and I paid back everyone(Cause I said i'd cover them, and I ain't a liar.) -And am more keen to not let others in on my riches, thought it was fine, I had it, and I'd never be broke again. Wrong.)

I've learned a lot about risk management, the value of a dollar... maybe try having only 1 call on a stock at a time. As long as you have some action there, you're covered. No need to double/triple down with 1-3 calls that could all expire worthless. I've learned a lot about what sharing financial information with others, etc. So much, we've all learned so much these past few months!\~

Give money more respect, for you to be able to blow this kind of money shows you can get more money. Do better, workout to these losses.(I do this.) Learn spreads.(I need to do this / am saving up 2k for margin account and advanced options trading.)

Budget better to prevent fomo. Start keeping some cash and add to it when you win so you just don't keep re-yolo'ing everything until you lose it..."

All she had to do was literally nothing. Had she done nothing when she noticed an obvious error of receiving 1.2 million dollars when she only expected $80, they would have corrected the error and her life would have gone on as normal. 

Instead the retard took the money and bought a house and a new car with it as if the bank if just gonna be like ""oh damn you spent it already i guess its your money now oh well you got us!""

How the fuck did her retard brain think this was gonna play out? The level of retard you have to achieve to do what this woman did is something wsb members could only dream of."

2021-04-14 21:21:36,wallstreetbets,Bought a model Y (check my Reddit profile name). Also ordered a cybertruck
2021-04-14 21:23:46,wallstreetbets,I've been buying since 2013 I got in pre split at $30 and kept buying from there.
2021-04-15 17:29:45,wallstreetbets,"Back in 2013 I was unemployed, little to no savings (<$10K).  My roommate (who was an engineer) was really excited about Elon Musk.  I put $1K in when it was $30 per share (pre split).   Followed the TSLA reddit community, the youtubers, listened to the earnings call, and it helped me keep strong conviction as the stock oscillated up and down.  I started to progress in software sales, and the company I was working at (which was publicly traded) tripled in value, so my equity went from $30K to \~$100K.  I also made some bets on Square and other stocks, and reinvested all my savings into tech stocks, and bet on margin.  I ended up with about a total life savings of $300K after about 4 years.  From there, my sales manager was a total dick and was verbally abusive, and I thought to myself, I'd rather risk all my money to never be in this position again. As they say, diversification is a rich mans game, and you concentrate on high conviction stocks to build wealth.  As I saw TSLA drop in value, I became convinced more then ever that this was it, and I bet my entire life savings on the company.  At the time it was at $300 pre split, I put $300,000 in, and when it hit $1,000, at which point I became a millionaire.  I was in utter shock and disbelief.  There's significant psychological issues that come up when your wealth increases by that much, that quickly, it was like winning the lottery.  I felt the urge to diversify, but continued to hold on.  I ended up buying call options, and also did covered calls.  The stock continued to go up, and I rolled those covered calls out.  I'm now at the point where I feel good diversifying in to real estate and a mix of index/growth funds,  but I plan to keep 20-40% in TESLA long term."

2021-04-15 13:17:43,wallstreetbets,"Certainly can be part of a good strategy. But if you're just selling calls without thinking, its going to force you into holding onto losers and selling winners early, something most retail investors already do way too much.

Not saying never do it, but the idea that cc are free money is proven wrong. Like most things with options, unless you know what you are doing and have a specific plan your returns are better just buying and holding the stock."

2021-04-15 05:09:18,wallstreetbets,"You have no idea what you are talking about.

2021-04-15 05:16:47,wallstreetbets,"It did trade sideways for years with some ups and downs along the way but it won't trade sideways within the next 1-2 years. 

If you watched the CMD presentation, you would have known that is simply not possible. Unless, you for sure know this new conservative CEO and his colleagues are lying to us. I don't think that is the case as he has been very conservative with his guidance so far."
2021-04-15 13:49:24,wallstreetbets,hahahahaha
2021-04-15 05:22:41,wallstreetbets,"Nokia stock staying flat has nothing to do with too many shares outstanding.

It has everything to do with its performance.

The previous CEO over-promised and way under-achieved. It's competitor Ericsson stole a decent chunk of the 5G market from Nokia. Nokia also lost a giant Verizon contract to Samsung. Additionally, Ericsson has higher revenues and lower operating expenses therefore much better margins.

All these things make the market approach carefully to this stock.

The new CEO is doing everything right. He is conservative, he is taking the right steps for recovery and increasing the R&D for industry leadership. The market now wants to see if he will succeed before believing in this stock.

I do, therefore I am all in.

For this stock to get to $9-12 range, it will need couple good quarters and a positive guidance by the CEO. 

Based on my spreadsheet/calculations, with Pekka's conservative outlook, Nokia still should reach about $8 by sometime in late 2022."

2021-04-15 06:02:54,wallstreetbets,"TRD and MDD have a TAM of 18.9 billion. Compass has received patents on using psilocybin to treat both and has phase two FDA trials for additional disorders including manic depressive disorder and anorexia. 

CMPS has a market cap of only 1.5-2 billion...

Critics claimed CMPS was ‚Äúoverpriced‚Äù at 400 million. Just wait for the ATAI IPO. ;-)"
2021-04-15 06:48:13,wallstreetbets,"I included two valuations posted to SA that are a lot more robust than anything I would replicate in a post on Reddit. Successfully going to market and getting nearly any market capture whatsoever would make this company undervalued at present. 

TAM here can also be indirectly estimated by looking at mental health trends, especially for TRD and MDD. Linked those stats as well."
2021-04-15 05:50:13,wallstreetbets,You need synthetic to pass fda trials. Must meet ‚Äúcurrent good manufacturing processes‚Äù. Shrooms grown in cow shit will not work - sorry.
2021-04-15 05:54:41,wallstreetbets,Probably in May? It will meet the one year seasoning rule then.
2021-04-14 21:18:25,wallstreetbets,But why develop something new when something already exists?  Because you can‚Äôt make money off shrooms unless you are an illegal drug dealer.  Except Denver and Portland now.

2021-04-15 15:58:19,wallstreetbets,">Lawsuits and SEC Inquiry. Basically, there are a couple of lawsuits and an SEC probe that are looking into $RIDE‚Äôs pre-orders. $RIDE claimed to have 100,000 non-binding reservations, and there are now questions about whether or not these pre-orders are legit.

This seems like trouble. Making false claims about pre-orders and pre-sales and how entire first year of production is already sold out, then come out and say *""I don't think anybody thought that we had actual orders""* Ummmmmmm... *WHAT?*

>This does not concern me. Like I mentioned earlier $RIDE Director of Government Relations & Corporate Affairs, Chris Kerzich, already made it clear that demand is robust, and it will take them ‚Äúa couple of years‚Äù to fulfill the current demand.

Obviously what drew me to Reddit was seeing the GameStop shit on the news, but I didn‚Äôt buy any. I didn‚Äôt know shit about shit. Just started reading the posts and enjoyed the humor here. Started poking around on other subs and learning more and more....the reason I stick up for this stock isn‚Äôt because I‚Äôm some kind of covert worker for the company, or a boy, or any other kind of conspiracy...is just out of principal!

2021-04-15 09:42:03,wallstreetbets,"I see. I don't want to sound conspirational, it's just that if you pause to look at it these posts seem pretty one sided. I am sure there's some true retard here, but non all 800 posts.

As I said I have shares myself, so hope everything it works out. If Baja(where they have no competitor, just need to finish the race) makes them pick up good press I am willing to keep the stock, see if they actually have something coming."

Lol IV is 400% + on some and there‚Äôs next to nobody buying them.  When I placed an order for the 19.5 RH asked if I was sure I wanted them lol ! And I bought immediately after reading this fantastic report ! If I could have sold at peak today it would of been 570-4800$ swing on the calls alone."
2021-04-15 18:03:07,wallstreetbets,Many of them went up 4 digit percents today. If only I could post screenshots lol

If your options moon and don‚Äôt sell (happens cuz it‚Äôs robinhood) just lower ur price by one or two dollars and it will sell immediately to bots. Sometimes the price they display is a bit fake so just lower one dollar at a time till it sells. Usually once ur $1 before fate price is when bots auto buy it"
2021-04-15 13:30:04,wallstreetbets,"No, I'm quoting the CEO. He says they have NO ORDERS, because they have NO PRODUCT.

2021-04-15 18:29:22,wallstreetbets,"Yea if u lower it enough it‚Äôll sell even if volume is zero once ur $1 below the genuine fare price. Bots are literally trained to sniff out the ‚Äúfree money‚Äù then they‚Äôll try to sell it for fare value and get stuck bagholding instead lol. 

Usually when a bot slurps it up the contract will sell instantly"
2021-04-15 18:34:06,wallstreetbets,"Yea careful with robinhood, it‚Äôs the worst platform. Other platforms charge 65cents for options contracts and super fast execution while robinhood charges arguably $1 or u get a really shitty execution. Also other platforms get u the best price unlike robinhood who gets u the worst price so it might seem like the fees are cheaper but ur also getting cheaper contracts most likely."

2021-04-15 19:19:17,wallstreetbets,"Take a breath, count to 10 and make a winning strategy !  Before I buy (most) of my options I use an app called optionstrat that shows me exactly how much I‚Äôll make or break by each day for each option. Been very helpful at deciding the risk/reward of deciding to hold or sell."
2021-04-15 18:36:42,wallstreetbets,"Well generally it shouldn‚Äôt cost more than the contract that‚Äôs ahead of it so ur contract should not be worth than the $24 or $22 contract. My contract is $12 and shit is barely worth anything at this point I ain‚Äôt looking at my port it‚Äôs bloody lol. 

In ur case with a spread that wide I‚Äôd look at the contract ahead and list a few dollars cheaper if u want a bot to slurp it up. If we moon next week you‚Äôll prolly see those gains for reals"
2021-04-15 18:38:15,wallstreetbets,"That‚Äôs good, idk abt webull but other genuine platforms offer stocks free as well if that‚Äôs what ur mostly gonna do. But a heads up for next time u should avoid wide spread and low open interest especially on robinhood. I bet they sold u those contracts for way more than what they worth rather than providing best price like other dealers would have"
2021-04-15 13:21:12,wallstreetbets,"SDC and Invisalign aren't the same.

The use of Invisalign can be both cosmetic and medical in nature. Smile Direct Club is purely cosmetic with no applicable medical uses.

Also, SDC is significantly cheaper because you're missing a lot of what comes along with Invisalign, mainly the care factor.

Lastly, Invisalign is directly marketed by local, trusted, neighborhood orthodontists. SDC is marketed just by SDC.

These companies are vastly different and SDC will never catch up.

This DD is like saying Dollar Tree will eventually be where Dollar General is at. They may appear similar to the uninformed but they are not the same."
2021-04-15 13:06:42,wallstreetbets,"Lol, I used SDC. 

I only opted in for a top aligner because I have a permanent bottom wire retainer on my bottom front teeth from previous orthodontics work. 

My back top left and back bottom left teeth don't align after the process of using SDC so I had to cut the back left tooth off the retainer so it would sit more in line with my bottom tooth. 

Kinda frustrating."

2021-04-14 23:14:06,wallstreetbets,May 14 59/70 debit spread. Entered for $315 a spread.
2021-04-15 00:08:49,wallstreetbets,How is that diff than a call option?
2021-04-15 00:25:06,wallstreetbets,"It's a call debit spread. You buy an ATM or ITM call and sell a further out call for the same expiration for a credit to reduce your risk and limit your profit. The idea is that you are being realistic with your expectations while also reducing your risk and breakeven. 

For example, if I just bought the 59 call for 5.50, I'm essentially saying DKNG has no limit by May 14 and it could go to infinity which is a stupid thing to think. By selling a call at a price where I think it can reach that also returns me a decent credit back, in this case the 70 strike for 2.35, I am now being realistic with where I believe the stock can reach and am lowering my risk from a max of $550 to $315 and limiting my profit from ""infinite"" to (70-59)-3.15 = $785. 

There is hardly ever a reason to buy a long call by itself over a debit spread. Be reasonable with the stocks potential and reduce your risk. It's an much smarter and safer play."

This stock is poised to grow from Covid-19. There market share is continually getting bigger with JNJ and Astra Zen now receiving halts and negative press.

BioNtech reported there recent earnings... who partners with PFE on vaccine. BioNtech blew earnings out of the water. 

Expected loss of -$0.99 to $0.64 they reported $1.85


PFE also filed for adolescent vaccination authorization in America and Europe.

With dwindling trust in the other vaccines and more people to give vaccines too with potential boosters. 

Im surprised this isn't in $50. Boomer stock or not... boom boom. Im in.

I hold 23 May 21st C $37.

I had 47 at one point but cashed out for some other plays. I'm holding now to upper 40s. Earnings should be great based off BioNtech bump."

2021-04-15 02:46:35,wallstreetbets,I have a condition that puts me in the high risk category. I got the JnJ. You're rolling your dice with covid or the shot. Chances are you'll survive both. So make the decision that's best for you.
2021-04-14 20:05:52,wallstreetbets,"No, I think there never should have been a lockdown to begin with."
2021-04-14 23:38:06,wallstreetbets,Other people can get vaccinated if they want and then they‚Äôre literally immune. My decision doesn‚Äôt effect them at all. And I‚Äôll continue my life normally because I‚Äôm not even remotely worried about COVID.
2021-04-15 09:16:26,wallstreetbets,"So what would you have recommended, we do instead? 500,000 people have died in the United States, and you're opposed to both vaccines and lockdowns. The only other strategy was to let it burn through the population until everyone has been infected, but that would have been an estimated death toll of 6 million."
2021-04-15 09:31:37,wallstreetbets,"But that's the problem your decision does affect us all. Currently 30% of the population is refusing to get vaccinated. At that level we will never achieve herd immunity, let alone eradicating it as we did with smallpox and polio.

Vaccines save lives. Anyone fit enough to be vaccinated needs to do their part for those that cant.  This isn't a personal liberty decision, its a collective responsibility and choosing not to get the virus is actively prolonging the pandemic.

So vaccine or pandemic, pick one."

2021-04-15 02:51:36,wallstreetbets,"There's a difference between being anti-vax and having legitimate questions about the safety concerns surrounding emergency approved vaccines with trial sizes well below the size needed to determine all side effects. The lack of nuance doesn't help vaccine acceptance and helps give those Karen's more ammunition.

And I have the vaccine because I'm in a risk group. It's an expiramental drug tho. And pharmaceutical companies have an abysmal track record at fucking people."
2021-04-15 09:30:15,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm not a troll and I‚Äôm not knocking herd immunity. But if you think that getting vaccinated somehow stops you from transmitting a virus from one person to another, you‚Äôre wrong."
2021-04-15 11:13:42,wallstreetbets,"It drastically reduces the likelihood, obviously. Are you claiming that a reducing transmission likelihood from ""somewhat likely"" when unvaccinated to ""really really unlikely"" when vaccinated doesn't matter?

Yeah, if a vaccinated person touches a surface riddled with the virus they can probably pass it to another person that day. But they don't have an active infection where they are breathing it on everyone around them.

You're basically saying that since people with umbrellas still get kinda wet on really rainy days that umbrellas aren't valuable."

https://insideevs.com/reviews/494548/ford-mache-tesla-model-y-range-war/

The Mach-E has the 7500 dollar tax credit making it cheaper than the Model Y.

The Mach-E has Android Auto and Apple Carplay, Tesla does not.

2021-04-14 20:28:23,wallstreetbets,"So I am very confused by the movement of these options today.  I didn't see the delta on the 36c drop below 0.11, and the stock shot up in the morning by half a dollar, and yet the value of the option didn't move. I doubt very much the time decay was eating away at the same rate as the increase due to the underlying's move, but I am fairly new to options so maybe this explains it?  Bottom line, the thesis of large movement was dead on, yet the play failed to deliver.  I doubt very much tmw. will make this trade profitable, but we'll see.  Thoughts?"
2021-04-15 01:17:40,wallstreetbets,"JPM killed us. Maybe BAC killing it tomorrow (next largest XLF holding) will help move the group. 

The 36C did move up to a high of 0.06 with the highs today. 

TOS thinks there's a 10% chance we close outside 34/36. Seems reasonable to me. This is a super long shot bet, but I think the value vs risk is worth it. I am going to hold it all the way through Friday. Commissions are too high to be worth recouping."

2021-04-14 22:28:47,wallstreetbets,"Damn guys, 
I forgot C++ and therefore I can‚Äôt activate balls drain and cum recycling protocol. 
Im gonna need my technician to take a look at my cock massager chamber tomorrow since I can‚Äôt reach back there 

But my mouth feature usually works, however one of you forgot to turn on cum recycler after finishing in my  mouth cum storage 

Don‚Äôt forget to empty the cum storage or I malfunction! How many times I gotta fucking tell you WSB!"

2021-04-15 07:39:19,wallstreetbets,I'm very excited my buying opportunity came to fruition. Alex karp practically confirmed the demo would be for customers not investors. I'm proud they stuck to their guns of long term focus... stock price means nothing today or tomorrow. Thinking 3-5yrs out
2021-04-14 22:53:25,wallstreetbets,Sitting on a large VXX position for way too long with paper losses that perfectly match all my profits for the past year (slightly above after costs). Needed a quick hedge back in Mar-20 and doubled down several times. Loss aversion is what kills ya.
2021-04-14 23:45:56,wallstreetbets,"Not long ago,  you folk said the vaccine wasn‚Äôt necessary because only 1 out of 300 people seemed to have a negative reaction to the virus.
Now one in a million have a reaction to one out of three leading brands, and it‚Äôs something we should avoid?
I think you might need to have a solid look at your mathematics skills as something seems to have gone wrong."
2021-04-15 00:19:34,wallstreetbets,"Sorry friend I‚Äôm not you folk, I‚Äôm a unique individual just like you. I have traveled my own path in life just like you. We all have our own experiences that guide us. After my 1st child got his 1st and only MMR shot he got a sudden fever of 106. What do you do? I put him in a tub of cold water and all the ice I had and gave him a fever reducer. It was a few weeks before we saw the Dr again. When she listened to his chest her eyes got as big as a silver dollar and she said he had a heart murmur and we needed to go see a specialists. He said my child would live a normal life till about 45 and he would need a heart valve transplant. I had heard about mercury and aluminum being in shots and thought there must be more to that than this. It was to me. Until the new mRNA all shots were cell based. That means cells were used from aborted baby, monkey, dog.... The idea repulsed me. So I had a talk with the creator and said I‚Äôd make wiser choices. You see, that was a self inflicted wound to me. I didn‚Äôt happen by natural means. Whether you believe in a creator or not we have an immune system and we have a competing force; bacteria and viruses. We have a beginning and end. If you work out your bones and muscles they get stronger don‚Äôt they?  It‚Äôs the same for your immune system. It needs a workout to stay strong and that‚Äôs where white blood cells, T and B cells come in. So all the people say the survivability is 99.97% , well the shot is 95% or did they back it down today to 90% effective. Either way our own immunity is better than the experimental shot that‚Äôs not FDA approved and which you can not sue for damages. But ask your self a question, why are they so dang determined to give you a shot? The monoclonal antibodies are the bomb! I would refuse treatment for that myself personally but they are dynamite. We have a cheap prophylaxis already with Ivermectin for early treatment. If the government(S) really wanted to help they‚Äôd tell people to exercise, get sunshine, stop eating sugar and maybe go on Keto diet or whatever and lose weight. The government(S) are addressing nothing but roll your sleeve up. There‚Äôs Regeneron and Ivermectin why? But I‚Äôm telling you if you read the trial studies Pfizer and Moderna had more side effects than the other 2. BMJ even wrote an article on it and questioned the amount of data they left out. I wouldn‚Äôt want to be a bag holder if the media ever gives that scrutiny. By the way, if I did want to synthetically enhance my immune system for flu I‚Äôd use flu mist , it only has dead flu virus and amino acids. It goes up your nose like a normal human/virus normally happens. 

It‚Äôs a good chance some really old and feeble people may have lived longer if they hadn‚Äôt got a flu shot but they didn‚Äôt know know better and just blindly trusted people

But I guess 7% server market is touching AMD with a 10-foot pole, right?"
2021-04-15 18:51:46,wallstreetbets,So you're wrong. Thank you for admitting it.
2021-04-15 07:48:02,wallstreetbets,You are retarded. The market has already collapsed then FED changed the rules and started printing money like crazy.
2021-04-15 12:59:25,wallstreetbets,"And where is the market now dumbass?   Like I said, the Fed is propping the bond bubble up, and easy money policy is flowing into markets.  Ooh, the market was down for a month or two and right back to new ATHs by EOY...wow such Armageddon.

Also, yes the Fed started ""printing money"" by lowering overnight rates and buying Treasuries (propping down bond yields).  They didn't print money fast enough for a 3mo rebound, though.  Most of the bounce back was  wealth buying the dip in a big way."
2021-04-15 15:49:17,wallstreetbets,"I like this trade and bought a contract at 5.40 today. If it takes a huge dip I'll buy another.

LEAPs like this are where the money is IMO."
2021-04-15 16:33:39,wallstreetbets,agreed.

2021-04-15 14:36:05,wallstreetbets,Those $80C are about to be ITM. I wonder if we‚Äôre going to see much more for movement on the 19th?
2021-04-15 17:41:09,wallstreetbets,"I brought this up last night in AllDatDalton's DD last night but haven't gotten much feedback. If this thesis is mostly based on inclusion in the new index and Blackrock buying in then why would NEE be a better move than XEL? If you go in that spreadsheet he linked it shows that NEE and XEL are the only two stocks that are weighted at 4%, the heaviest in the ETF. But XEL has a quarter the market cap of NEE. Wouldn't that make it a much better play, 4x better that NEE? Or am I missing something here?

One con I can think of is that NEE is a bigger and better known company so any rise there might attract more subsequent from buying from elsewhere than XEL would. Other than that I know nothing about Xcel Energy, maybe they're a total piece of shit company.

Some of the other factors you listed apply to XEL too - a ways from ATH, a big boring utility thats unlikely to take a hard downturn, they're also wanting to build new solar plants, etc.

Any thoughts?"
2021-04-15 14:36:51,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm debating on holding those $80 calls longer.
2021-04-15 02:19:46,wallstreetbets,"Not sure where you are seeing that.

2021-04-15 16:07:01,wallstreetbets,I stumbled into some 80c last week and I‚Äôm up about 50% already. Is the recent price flux due to the effects of the rebalance or some other catalyst?
