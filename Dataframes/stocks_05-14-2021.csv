2021-05-14 19:35:12,stocks,If there's low volume then you'll have to sell for a lower price.  In order to sell a stock somebody needs to be willing to buy it for whatever price you're asking. If there's low volume there's not many people wanting to buy that stock so in order to sell it you're going to have to sell it for less than what it's currently worth.
2021-05-14 19:37:59,stocks,Can’t sell at a price if no one is buying.
2021-05-14 19:41:23,stocks,That ETF has low daily volume.  Volume is one of the things you should check before buying.  Low Vol = low liquidity.  That means it can be hard to sell.  You wil have to lower you ask price.
2021-05-14 19:37:30,stocks,Supply demand. If there is no demand then your supply doesn’t move.
2021-05-14 19:37:08,stocks,Gotta wait for bid price to rise if your Adamant on that price

2021-05-14 19:48:28,stocks,Thank you
2021-05-14 19:48:13,stocks,Ok thanks. Is it usually instant if the stock has a high volume?
2021-05-14 19:42:26,stocks,"Just FYI i look for a min vol of 400,00 daily."
2021-05-14 19:52:33,stocks,Yep! This is only once it sells though.
2021-05-14 19:49:35,stocks,You're welcome.  When I first started investing I got screwed not knowing this.  It's even worse if the stock is losing value while you try to sell it.
2021-05-14 19:51:30,stocks,"Yes if it's just a market order, or if the price you're asking is about the current price"
2021-05-14 19:01:06,stocks,I see your post and noticed that your Reddit account is pretty new.  Welcome to Reddit.
2021-05-14 19:06:42,stocks," Whoa hot take, a meme stock will result in bag holders"
2021-05-14 19:11:14,stocks,Good analysis. Zero sources. Very convincing. Gosh guys I guess I should sell all my amc now while it's going up.
2021-05-14 19:59:37,stocks,"We will never know, because any bag holder will just claim it's a long term investment, so just like every other opinion on here, tacos."
2021-05-14 18:54:58,stocks,Every stock has bag holders.  Why would AMC be any different?
2021-05-14 19:10:38,stocks,"Good post, people use the term short squeeze way too liberally. I’ve heard people unironically think AMC will hit 100"
2021-05-14 19:55:43,stocks,I keep seeing people genuinely believe the price is cheap compared to pre covid because the share price is lower. That’s all that needs to be said
2021-05-14 19:08:55,stocks,There is still nostalgia for the theater. Everyones been locked down and now the movies are going open up. Summer is here!
2021-05-14 19:15:08,stocks,If you think that then Don’t buy it and move on . No one is forcing you .
2021-05-14 18:53:01,stocks,ex AMC bag holder here. made back my losses and up $1 for the year. still making back my 2020 quarantine losses though
2021-05-14 19:12:17,stocks,"Well said.  I think everyone knows, even the 'we like the stock' crowd.  They just don't care.  This is all one big get rich lottery play.  New retail investors ARE ponzi investors.  That is the type of play they are looking for.  They do not care about fundamentals, valuations or, hell, any facts at all. They hope they can drive up the price and when they do they will secretly play musical bag holders hoping they are the one to get out before the bubble bursts.

Also, AMC leadership is not investors buddy.  Insiders have sold 14mil shares the last 3 months compared to buying 120k.  They love this squeeze talk because they are unloading at 2-3x the normal price.  Once they feel the free ride is over they will find a way to extract some big money before the big pop."
2021-05-14 19:16:44,stocks,"I’m starting to think the next squeeze will never happen because every time this bitch hits $14-$14.50 everyone sells, except the few diamond hands on Reddit, or so they say... yea any investor knows it is way overvalued right now, but they aren’t here for fundamentals, just the community and hope for a squeeze. I’ll probably paper hand if it hits $14 again and never look at it again. Although if I was smart I’d buy some put options on it."
2021-05-14 19:30:16,stocks,"Not if you sell covered calls and average down to 0.

Source: am pretty much there. Started avg price of 3.45, probably down to under 2 bucks now!"
2021-05-14 19:55:31,stocks,"One sentence take is...

They've proven twice they will keep issuing stock if you keep pushing the price up over its value."
2021-05-14 19:39:59,stocks,Consensus disagrees!
2021-05-14 19:50:27,stocks,"All you gotta do is say “to the moon” or “tendies” or “ima ape or autist” and you can make thousands (even millions!) just by buying a couple terrible stocks   Oh yeah and you gotta join the wsb reddit sub 
Duhh"
2021-05-14 19:29:08,stocks,If only people realized there’s no such thing as a short squeeze 😂 these kids crack me up!
2021-05-14 19:26:00,stocks,I think its funny he had all this data and complex shit when the real reason it will be shit is that less and less people are going to the movies and movies have been released successfully strait to streaming services and produces by said services as well- the end of going to the movies era is coming - however that is my take - people could be much dumber than I think and like going to the movies still.
2021-05-14 19:16:15,stocks,He must've missed the last time AMC spiked and left a bunch of bagholders.
2021-05-14 18:56:37,stocks,"Not if the stock rises overall?  For instance, I don't think AAPL will have any bagholders from this year 3 years from now.  Can't say the same for AMC.  Also, talking short-term timeframe here."
2021-05-14 19:10:42,stocks,"No doubt, no doubt.  But as mentioned above, it’s still overvalued even assuming a complete recovery!"
2021-05-14 19:27:37,stocks,I disagree I think streaming services being able to make their own content and also stream new movie content will be a giant hunk of revenue that will not be reclaimable no matter how they try and pivot.
2021-05-14 19:15:56,stocks,No one is forcing you to read this either :) just sharing my thoughts on the situation
2021-05-14 19:24:36,stocks,Holy shit how did you have losses during that bull market lol unless you mean you invested before the dump
2021-05-14 19:17:41,stocks,IV is too high for put options :( probably better to do a bear spread IMO
2021-05-14 19:37:28,stocks,Or a short hedge fund that doesnt want it to go higher starts shorting it around there. Doesnt mean people are selling
2021-05-14 19:40:49,stocks,$3 was the time to get in :P
2021-05-14 19:29:15,stocks,People love going to the movies. It is a tradition. I hate it because they have the sound cranked up too high.
2021-05-14 19:29:15,stocks,"I think AAPL will also have bag holders in 3 years, but they won't be down as much as AMC bag holders."
2021-05-14 19:26:20,stocks,"Hedgers have already gotten smacked by WSB for going after AMC. There is no reason to keep trying to take AMC down when there are tons of other vulnerable companies to short. AMC and Gamestop are forever legends. They are favorites to own. That being said, I don't have any AMC or GME stock. I'm just watching. I agree with you that someday AMC is going to leave bag holders, but for many that was the point. To show your love and power. The big guys got rocked. It was a historical event. For that reason, owning them is a matter of pride. That's why I left WSB. It was ""TO THE MOON"" on every post."
2021-05-14 19:58:00,stocks,I’m going to believe what an idiot from the web is saying about AMC being overpriced while neutral experts upgraded AMC from $13 to $16 value and said it is underpriced at the price is trading[B.

2021-05-14 19:25:06,stocks,"no, got introduced to options. nuff said"
2021-05-14 19:11:49,stocks,"I own NET as well and believe in the tech. It still has nosebleed financial ratios though.

IMO, they don’t charge enough for their product. I suppose they will steadily eat market share instead. Can’t be upset at a steady 50% YOY revenue growth."
2021-05-14 19:21:20,stocks,"If you’re gonna own a company priced at 40x sales, it is inherently going to be very volatile. NET has incredible growth ahead of it but it also has a ton growth already priced in to the stock. It has nothing to do with the company itself, but the higher a valuation is, the longer the duration that asset is. That means small changes in things like interest rates have magnified impacts on the stock. In other words, Cloudflare volatility isn’t going anywhere."
2021-05-14 19:38:16,stocks,"Fsly is the example for net, if net slows down , it will be shorted as bad."
2021-05-14 19:22:00,stocks,"Nobody knows what they are planning. Maybe they already bought their positions and are trying to pump their holdings. Have to ask yourself why financial institutions, whose entire business model is built around screwing retail investors, would give out such valuable information to us for free."

2021-05-14 18:02:27,stocks,"I work at an airport and have been for 20 years. At about 6am, I walk by the Delta ticket counter and it's the longest line I've ever seen. Later in the day about 11am, I'm walking the concourse and I overhear a gate agent say, ""...the flight is full and and overhead compartment space is limited.... please gate check your carry on...."" spiel. I look over and it's a Delta flight to Vegas. It is Friday though. 🤷‍♂️"
2021-05-14 17:22:05,stocks,"Most of the companies I think your talking about have dropped right along with tech (at least the ones I’m holding). MAR, UAL, AAL, NCLH, CCL, MGM, WYNN, and even OXY as a reopening trade on oil demand. I hold all of these and they’ve been getting clobbered the past 2 months right along with tech. Most of them are down nearly 20%, some more from their highs.

My biggest winners have been banks and retail surprisingly (banks not so surprising given inflation fears)."
2021-05-14 19:44:03,stocks,"Entertainment will be back but you do need to be careful. For example, all the cruise lines diluted to high hell during COVID and issued some pretty bad bonds, some which are convertible which will dilute even more going forward. And they are foreign business and run by really nasty folks. Look up the history of cruise lines and be in awe of all the bankruptcies and how they are still controlled by the same circle of people. Basically they let their companies go bankrupt, then have their buddies buy the boats for pennies on the dollar. Then take more investor money and relist. Rinse and repeat. A lot of REITs do something like this too so be careful.

Many Hotels are up to pre-covid levels already on speculation of return to norm. The ones that arent, were not so great fundamentally even before COVID and in general, hotels are volatile and casinos have been on a down trend for a while too. Basically Macau ate a huge portion of their market (the Chinese love gambling) when it became big and now online gambling is competing with them... 

Im sure there will always be a place for Vegas but the old days arent coming back. It used to be all about gambling, porn and parties. Gambling has shrunk, porn went online but they still have parties I guess."
2021-05-14 17:41:23,stocks,I like AHT. Upscale Hotel REIT. Cheap right now. Huge potential to return back to pre-covid prices. Just my opinion.
2021-05-14 17:43:15,stocks,"Biggest casino companies (Wynn,MGM)are moving to online betting,hopes are high for this sector. Look forward to see those who have physical casinos in Macao to pick up the pace,even if licenses are to be reviewed in 2022. While the cruise ship business that’s going to be some tough times for a while. I’m holding my gaming stocks anyway,I’m in for the long run with them."
2021-05-14 18:57:42,stocks,Boats hotels and banks could leave you crying but when things get bad people love to gamble wynn resorts will do well imo
2021-05-14 19:15:40,stocks,"Cruise lines will be back in operations end of this year with how the vaccines are being rolled out, they set a timetable for end of July. CCL has  mentioned that they’re being booked for cruises next year already, the pent up demand is there."
2021-05-14 18:23:38,stocks,"As someone who's also worked in aviation for 13 years,  these low yield, budget conscious tourist are not the airlines money makers. The business travelers with expense accounts, full fare-refundable tickets and corporate contratcs for 1st class seats are who they need. They still haven't returned in the numbers anyone would like to see. And the whole switch to work from home and zoom meetings has people wondering of business will forgo the travel budgets from here on out. Only time will tell. Long story short, full planes doesn't equal profit."
2021-05-14 18:46:44,stocks,"Yes, you are right. Private business has no incentive for spending money when they can just zoom meetings and the travel industry will adapt because they will have to. As they can't rely on those fat business accounts. However, they make a pretty penny on the government. The prices the governments pay to the airlines are far higher than what the consumer pays. There has also been a high uptick in DOD and Federal LEO travel. I'm speculating other parts of the government have increased their travel. Anyways, more people are traveling and earnings should not be as bad as they have been for the past year. So, it's not about plane full airlines good..... that was just an off hand remark to my bullish sentiment."
2021-05-14 17:50:35,stocks,"TSLA seems to run on hype. Obviously the company has a lot of potential for the next 5-10 years.. but yes I think the stock is overpriced. 

How soon it will correct itself, I’m not sure, but it probably will at some point. Or it won’t, idk it seems like anything Elon does pushes it up so who knows"
2021-05-14 17:33:18,stocks,"Tbh for me Tesla is a gimmick. It's price can never be justified but people still worship Tesla because of Elon Musk. 

Tesla as a car company is nothing super special. Yes, they are currently leaders in EV but for how long? Every major brand is catching up. Also Tesla for me lacks a certain character. 

F.e. Daimler (Mercedes-Benz) is known for it's AMG brand (just look at that sexy EQS), Porsche is known for sports cars, Asian manufacturers are known for cheap but good products, VW is known for German engineering etc. 

Tesla is not a bad company but the valuation is the problem. It should not be higher valued than f.e. BMW or Daimler (atleast not right now), let alone be more expensive than all car manufacturers together."
2021-05-14 17:47:46,stocks,You can hate on Elon but Idk why people still doubt his companies. Tesla is so far ahead with their gigafactories and self driving tech. Doubting Elon is like doubting Steve Jobs in 2008 when the iPhone came out.
2021-05-14 19:01:34,stocks,"The whole EV market is down. Between the chip shortage and inflation, it’s a blood bath. Keep your eye on Nio. Good buy right now."
2021-05-14 17:16:44,stocks,Tesla might be a turd on the sidewalk.  You dont need to try and value it.  Just step over it and go on with life
2021-05-14 19:13:54,stocks,"Tesla is a little cultish. it's a bit like Apple was 20 years ago with the worship of Steve Jobs. Tesla and Apple both make good products, but it's more than that ... almost a religious element to the hardcore fans, it's not just a product but a lifestyle and philosophy of the world. 

any other company, Elon would have been forced out by now after the Thai pedo tweets, the ambien tweets, the dogecoin stuff ... he's more than a little erratic. 

the valuation is still crazy. they sell 1% of cars globally but are more valuable that all the rest put together: GM, Toyota, etc. it's sheer insanity."
2021-05-14 18:06:46,stocks,"Not sure if it's related but Tesla started it's slip almost at the same time as VW stated it's gain. Couple of weeks before VW online event the price started to move up from 160 to 190, and after the event toped at 240 eur. Tesla were going sideways since then.

Could be not realated, but VW claimed that will be leaders in EV by 2025. And that may well be true knowing it's capacity for engineering and production.

Anyways major competition and narrative around Tesla's and other tech bubble may be the reasons of the stock losing it's momentum."
2021-05-14 17:29:36,stocks,"The stock market runs on feelings, not facts.  The only thing that matters about a stock's value is how much people think it's worth.

TSLA is over valued by all logical reasoning, as are many other stocks.  

The only thing that matters for stocks is how much marketing buzz can be created, increasing investor interest and confidence.

Look at all the meme stocks for another example.  They're only valuable because enough apes buy them, which then causes institutional investors or computer trading systems at big brokerages to buy them.

I've made a decent amount of money off of stocks, but I make no illusions that it's just gambling based on feelings, not any kind of intrinsic or real value."

>The competition is heating up as well, if there was no semiconductor shortage, the new e-mustang would eat into Tesla sales much more than it did. Same with other manufacturers.

The rally is probably more from the good cdc news about mask wearing. That's good for business."

Keep in mind, Indonesia is a very corrupt place. Maybe an opportunity to buy low, but Uber really isn't doing well anywhere. With that, it'll probably moon."
2021-05-14 18:18:10,stocks,"I'd chalk the price not going up to broader sentiment towards SPAC's. The market isn't feeling SPAC's right now. Profitability is generally a concern with businesses in the ride sharing space like Uber, and they tend to run into regulatory issues as well. 

&#x200B;

This company interests me too because they've diversified beyond just ride sharing and delivering food, and Grab Pay gives them exposure to emerging market fintech. I recommend reading into the regulatory climate of the different countries they're in since that could spike legal expenses and hamper revenue. Definitely an interesting business."

Buying options in belief that the price will move your way is ok, buying options to force gamma squeeze is not- nobody can know your intentions so this one is hard to prove, but if you start talking people into it it is illegal to coordinate actions that aim to move the stock price.

But there's absolutely no reason to say ""you should buy this stock. this is not financial advice"".

2021-05-14 16:06:05,stocks,"It also has to do with your positions, say, Elon musk hyping d-o-g- e to tank B - T -C then selling off his D to buy B at the bottom, that is manipulation because of his social following and positions within the stock. Or say, roaring kitty, a financial specialist, hyping another stock and cashing out his profit from the hype, would also be manipulation had he remained in his financial position.

If you’re a no body then you have nothing to worry about as it’s unlikely anything you say will influence a stock or it’s buyers, but a social media entity with millions of followers is a different story and lawsuits would be easily leveraged."

2021-05-14 15:40:49,stocks,"There’s likely a few different catalysts for this but the two simplest: (1) Low volume is causing a very wide bid-ask spread so the price isn’t moving with the theoretical price, (2) Theta is large enough to counteract delta/underlying price given the option is still OTM

Edit 1: The above assumes you purchased the options at a fair value. If you overpaid, this might be null, and what you are seeing is mean reversion to the fair option value.

Edit 2: We would need more information about the specific position you took in order to give a more precise answer."
2021-05-14 19:08:11,stocks,"For an option with a date that short and that far OTM, you are talking about serious theta decay. You can't measure it in days, it is more like hours or maybe even minutes. Your probability of profit is in the single digits for this contract.

Play around with this tool to see how much the underlying has to move per day just to break even on a contract like that:

The market isn't stupid. If you think you've found a fool proof way to make money then you won't be posting about it on Reddit or you're wrong and will find out soon enough.

If you actually want to be smart with options use them as a hedge or buy an ATM/slightly ITM play with at least 30-45 DTE. Even then, if you don't have a good sense of direction for how the stock is going to move, you will get eaten alive. There is a reason selling options is always >50% success vs buying.

Leverage works in both directions. I avoid speculating with options. It's a good way to see your money disappear."
2021-05-14 19:22:28,stocks,"The slightest decrease in IV will obliterate any OTM options which are close to expiring. This is probably what happened - price changes due to vega and theta beat changes due to delta.

Well lesson learnt, just cuz and underlying spikes doesn’t mean you can go buy a put for when it drops and make money. Even the ITM puts I noticed at the end of the day decreased in value."

Closed at $12.97 and I lost 44% lol. Maybe it will tank Monday and I’ll still be alright but I was hoping maybe there was an indicator that maybe I should have looked for that stood out that said don’t buy this put!

Edit: also keep in mind, theta is day to day decay, so I thought, right? This happened today, bought the puts at peak today, underlying price went down 10%, put premium went down 44%..."
2021-05-14 19:10:15,stocks,It’s hard to arbitrage American options with substantial volume because you can exercise whenever you want (unless the volume is high yet the options are mostly held by retail investors in small blocks as exercising is expensive relative to small positions). My guess is the day over day loss is being driven by theta if what you’re saying about the underlying price and volatility is correct. I highly doubt interest rates (dividends excluded) caused this. There are no other inputs into pricing.
2021-05-14 18:34:58,stocks,"What was the value of your option?  How much did you pay for it?  Let’s say you paid 5% for it (just an assumption based on OTM-ness), so roughly $.5 for an option. If your theta is .058, then by the end of the day you lost about 11.6% even if it is theta. And that’s not including gain on delta...

Hmmmm... this doesn’t look right. 35% is really high."
2021-05-14 18:50:56,stocks,what was the gamma for that option?
2021-05-14 17:00:26,stocks,AMC? Puts I bought at peak today printed pretty good.
2021-05-14 19:27:26,stocks,"i mean looking at the greeks, sounds about right.

EDIT: i misread. thought you Sold to open a put. then im not sure.

but are you sure IV stayed constant at 180 throughout the day? it looks like its 148ish rn. if so, it would make sense.

lastly, theta ticks every second of the day. not just end of business day."
2021-05-14 16:48:37,stocks,Oh apologize about that that you been trading options since November. I guess you can answer your question then since you had the experience. Good luck
2021-05-14 17:47:41,stocks,Theta depends on time to expiry. It has nothing to do with days in particular; you could measure time in seconds if you want.
2021-05-14 17:46:26,stocks,"I guess a better way to put it would be “time decay” rather than theta, if you prefer. I don’t know if theta is recalculated on a daily basis (I’m still learning options, too), but every minute that goes by where your next week OTM option is looking less likely to print (or, even tho AMC went down it’s not going down so much that 10.50 looks likely), I’d expect the market makers to be pricing that in in real time, not waiting till tomorrow to subtract the theta from your premium price. 

But again, I’m still learning, so I could be completely wrong!"
2021-05-14 19:04:06,stocks,"I actually ended the day at a 44% loss, see lower in comment thread for full details of what I paid."

2021-05-14 19:57:07,stocks,"Yeah I just learned that lol, I thought it was day to day, I think I’ve figured it out. When I made the post iv was at 176, I just looked and it did drop to 166 right before close. Looks like a combo of a few things but a lot of the comments here have helped me wrap my head around it, kind of a snowball of an effect from theta, iv, and expectation of price stabilization due to the price dropping (iv again I guess lol). Anyways lesson learnt, thanks for the insight.👊🏻"

2021-05-14 18:23:43,stocks,"Ok, that’s news to me, I thought theta was a day to day decay."
2021-05-14 19:16:36,stocks,"I was thinking more - it might be the second order derivative of your theta. You started out at .058. It is possible that in one day it increased quite a bit and ended higher. Theta is a continuous function, not discrete at the end of the day. And you are very close - just a week away. And so so OTM...  the closer you get to expiry while being OTM, the more you lose."

2021-05-14 16:54:23,stocks,"I bought 100 shares of AAPL for $14/share circa 2002/2003. Sold about a year later in the mid-$20 range thinking ""hey, I nearly doubled my money in about a year. Moving on...""

That was before iPod money starting filtering to the bottom line, and obviously several years before the iPhone even came out.

Had I held the entire time from purchase until now, I'd have 5,600 shares (after splits) worth about $713,000 at today's closing prices.

So, yeah, I'd say I sold ***way*** too soon on that one. Though I tell myself that I probably would have sold after the first 2-for-1 split and it ticked back up to around $80/share and I would have had around $16,000. But, I think I just tell myself that to make me feel better."

Edit: I forgot about the rule-breaking 5.9% dividend yield. I'm worried it might be too hot though, they're a legacy stock but most of their future growth is based in tech. Apparently IRM stock doesn't care about the tech losses though, so far, hence ""I only wish I'd bought more."""

Waste Management (WM) - I expected it to be a stable, boring position that just diversified my portfolio, but it shot up as tech stocks struggled. Another stock that's low volatility, but can have significant gains over time.

XAR (Aerospace & Defense index) - Passive ETF in the industrials sector. Low expenses and nice returns since I bought it in 2020. Teledyne, Lockheed Martin and General Dynamics are some of the top holdings.

2021-05-14 19:43:19,stocks,"My definition of 'best' will be companies I think will vastly outperform the S&P 500 over the next 3 to 5 years -

1) $CRWD - Endpoint security demand will only increase as we move towards a more mobile and connected society. Combined with my belief that AI will position companies to position themselves as 'winner take all' in their industries due to a flywheel effect. Flywheel - subscribers expose AI to cyber threats -> AI learns to deal proficiently with these threats -> more subscribers come to the platform -> AI models further improve -> more subscribers come to platform -> etc.

2) $TDOC - Telemedicine will not replace 'retail' medicine, if you will. But it's use cases will expand and the pandemic has only accelerated that trend. TDOC's moat is in its 55,000 physicians and 450 sub-specialties on it's platform, not the actual videoconferencing software (anyone can do that). Also the AI component that Livongo provides. TDOC contracts directly with payers who pay a flat fee for their employees/members to use TDOC. What payers seek is better health outcomes aka increased utilization and less hospitalizations which are costly for the payers. $TDOC, utilizing their leading market share to have access to more data than competitors can better train Livongo's models and better assist with chronic care management (diabetes, high blood pressure, etc.) which improves patient's outcomes keeping them away from costly hospital admissions.

3) $TTCF - Plant-based frozen food company that is vertically integrated and rapidly expanding into major retailers. Just recently acquired two mexican food companies to expand product lines and gain access to additional production capacity because they literally can't keep up with demand. Every time I go to Target to purchase their product they are out of stock of many of the options. Sam Galleti (CEO) said on the most recent conference call that it is the most successful launch of a frozen food product in Target's history. They have many new foods that will be coming to Target and will be expanding to thousands of more stores over the coming year outside of their base of Walmart/Sam's club, Costco, and Target.

2021-05-14 19:11:41,stocks,"Mostly correct. Some minor edits.

They almost went under because of Steve to begin with. The proprietary nature of MAC was his game plan and he actively attacked clone makers. This is why they lost the PC war. This is why he was removed. Yes we had MAC clones too but Steve went out of his way to sue them and shut them down.

The MAC was not all roses. It was riddled with problems the biggest being that by the time each was released, it was already obsolete. Back then CPU and Mem advancement was insanely fast so being behind in hardware just 1 year made you obsolete and to add salt to the wound, Steve always wanted to charge a surplus for his machines. Back then they were very expensive so paying a premium for a obsolete machine was not going to end well. Today this is less of an issue because even something obsolete can pretty much do what most people need. Not so back then.

The MAC had major design issues. Due to being traditional RISC, it was insanely hard to code for and slow as hell at multitasking thus making it a pain to program for and not fun to use. It was good at very specific things like certain vector calculations when implemented correctly (though not for long... MMX killed it). But if you tried to use, say photoshop and listen to a mp3... lol good luck. Browser + Application? Hope you have a lot of patience... Windows on the other hand with a CISC processor handled such things seamlessly and was a lot easier to program.

Steves return didnt save Apple. He just happened to be around when MS screwed up with Windows ME. That was a disaster and MAC was around to take market share as the disaster transpired. If MS had simply moved straight to Win2k, Apple would be nothing today. But MS released ME and it was a not very usable especially in any sort of professional or educational capacity. It simply crashed too much and cost too much to maintain. If we had any other alternatives at the time, they would have taken market share too."

2021-05-14 19:01:32,stocks,"depending on her reaction to a steep drop, might want to look into a low-volatility ETF or fund to replace the S&P 500. look in the fundamentals  for a fund/stock for the 'beta', which measures volatility relative to the market. the S&P 500 or a total market index will have a 'beta' of about 1. the ARK funds will have a beta of about 1.6 or 60% sharper ups & downs than the market. a low-volatility fund might have a beta of only 0.5 or 0.7, so the ups & downs will be less dramatic. low volatility stocks are more likely to be value stocks, big boring established companies, so will often pay a relatively large dividend. 

SPLV has a beta of .7 and has a yield of 1.7% https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SPLV plus there are global low volatility funds to add some international exposure https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239605/ishares-msci-all-country-world-minimum-volatility-etf




also look at beta for the bond fund, they can be almost as volatile as the market which kinda defeats the purpose of adding stability. Peter Lynch of Fidelity said somewhere that bond funds can give a false sense of security. 

if longevity counts for something to her, look at DODBX, the Dodge & Cox balanced fund. established in the early 1930s it's one of the oldest mutual funds still in existence, and IIRC the oldest that's still following its original mandate: ~70% blue chips, the remainder in quality bonds. fees are reasonable, and Dodge & Cox has an absolutely spotless reputation (Jack Boggle was a fan, saying they were one of the few active managers he'd recommend due to their long-term mindset, low turnover, and high ethical standards)."

2021-05-14 19:39:00,stocks,"> Currently SQ has a PE ratio of about 250. Net income is expected to grow around 45% a year. Lets say net income consistently increases by 50% each year and the price stays flat at $200. Then it would still take 7 whole years for it to reach a reasonable PE below 20.

Trust in your own research and findings."

At some point the fundamentals don’t matter as much as whether something is going to go up long term or not and without taking a position specifically on square I tend to think as long as they keep printing money via quantitative easing that entrenched well capitalized players will continue to increase in value due to a perception (even if misplaced) that its a safe place to put money"

You could can come up with a very elaborate algorithm that could correctly value a company's future growth/risks and current assets/liabilities. But if 99% of the money in the market don't agree, it doesn't matter (outside of bankruptcy). Look at the expanding multiples in today's market. Not trying to sound like an ass, but multiples tend to increase over time. Why is 30 times earnings acceptable or average today? Why not 10? Why not 1000? I relate it to the USD leaving the gold standard. Fundamentals are only as relevant as the market sees fit (outside of bankruptcy). Good post 9/10. Full disclosure I'm long SQ. Not financial advice.

TLDR: It's worth what someone will pay for it. Forecasting demand is a bitch. This is not financial advice."
2021-05-14 14:49:53,stocks,"You are holding for a long time. Just throw  like 80%  into stuff like VGT, QQQ and throw the remaining 20% in riskier etfs like QQQj and maybe some small cap etfs."
2021-05-14 19:44:09,stocks,"VTI has all the stocks in SCHD, so IMO no need to have both. if you want to keep SCHD, I'd add something with more small/mid cap because VTI has ~20% those stocks and SCHD is all large companies. (ignore the haters, there's research showing dividend paying stocks tend to outperform non-dividend stocks www.csinvesting.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/high-dividends-research-by-tweedy-browne.pdf)

>What advice do you have for adding a little more risk? 

do you mean ""more risk"" or ""more growth potential""? not always the same thing. there's tons of data showing small and mid-size company stocks tend to outperform everything else, over long periods. I'd ramp up the small and mid exposure https://contrarianoutlook.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SPY-Midcap-Smallcap-20yr-Chart.png

there's also plenty of data showing value stocks tend to outperform over long periods (EDIT: this might be a better link: https://thebamalliance.com/blog/is-the-value-premium-really-dead/). value can under-perform for years, but over the long haul has always beaten any other strategy. EDIT: I lean towards value stocks, but you always want a mix of everything ... I have some growth stocks too. 

low-volatility stocks also tend to do very well (https://www.invesco.com/us2/factor-investing/low-volatility-factor-101/) 

I would not recommend too much in any industry-specific things like QQQ, those are overheated and IMO will not continue to outperform. 

for international, the scandanavian/nordic nations tend to be very strong performers internationally so might want to allocate a bit to them (https://novelinvestor.com/international-stock-market-performance/). the emerging markets ETF is a good choice, emerging markets are so cheap right now that they'll do very well few years (according to Jeremy Grantham)."
2021-05-14 14:24:40,stocks,"If you're not concerned about dividends, why have so much SCHD? Or, any?

It's a fairly conservative portfolio for how young you are. Consider QQQM, QQQJ, IWO for more growth-oriented options. 

I'm of the opinion that VXUS and VWO are trash - it's a global economy, so they follow more or less the same trendline (with perhaps less volatility) as US markets for the privilege of higher expenses and lower returns. Someone can disillusion me on that if I'm wrong, though."

2021-05-14 14:40:20,stocks,Why have schd?  Maybe because I'm up 21% on it from when I bought in months ago.

By far my best performance stock and I'm relatively young and trend towards more growth related buys.

2021-05-14 14:57:38,stocks,"They are pretty much the same afaik. VGT might have a lower expense ratio though, which does matter in the long run. Other good long run vanguard etfs are things like VOT, VBK, VOOG, VUG. Any of those funds are going to likely do well in a long term hold."
2021-05-14 14:43:33,stocks,"SCHD has been doing particularly well lately because of a rotation out of technology into value-oriented companies. It's focused on dividend-paying, generally large cap stocks, which during more normal times aren't going to grow as strongly.

It's a great fund, don't get me wrong - just that you're 20, with a long time horizon, so the defensive nature of dividend payers isn't as useful."
2021-05-14 15:12:26,stocks,"Do you consider VTI in that last as well? 

And as far as my other positions would you keep them and just put new investments into other funds or liquidate my current holdings to reallocate? Thanks again!"

2021-05-14 15:20:28,stocks,VTI is good. Etfs like VGT and QQQ are just more aggressive and have done exceedingly well compared to VTI in the last 5 years.If you are already holding the etfs in your post in your portfolio i would just continue to hold them.
2021-05-14 14:57:02,stocks,"I can only speak for myself, but if I was 20 again and newly investing, I would focus more on growth.

HOWEVER

If you like the defensive nature of dividends - of getting some return, even in bad times - then keep some or all of your SCHD.

And, the immediate future is uncertain right now with fears around interest rates and inflation and SCHD may continue to outperform if so. No one can really say for certain."

2021-05-14 15:10:39,stocks,"I would like to focus more on growth. When you invest in growth based funds what are metrics you use to compare? 

Also do you recommend have a percentage of individual stocks? I want to once I understand how to valuate companies."
2021-05-14 15:45:25,stocks,"Usually when I'm looking at ETFs, I consider market cap, sector/theme, its returns on the 1/3/5/10 year & lifetime basis, and the company offering them. 

Small and mid cap stocks will usually outperform large caps, with the caveat of higher volatility. Sector or thematic ETFs (like ICLN) allow room for speculation on things you think are going to outperform in the future, but can be vulnerable to crashing (like ICLN over the last few months).

I would hold off on individual stocks until you feel like you've got your feet under you better and do not have any specific recommendation on allocation.

I'm not an expert by any means, mind, so definitely don't take my word as gospel."

2021-05-14 14:12:26,stocks,There is no universally accepted answer and it entirely depends on your unique situation and what tax bracket you fall under.  Usually it's better to wait to be taxed under long term investments but in some cases it may be better to fall under short term.  The information on the percentage of taxes you'll pay either way is readily available and there's nothing better than being informed on your own financial choices.
2021-05-14 14:11:19,stocks,"Yes I’d wait. As a matter of fact that’s exactly what I’m doing. Getting to a year, selling for long term gains, then moving into a ROTH because I should have done that in the first place."

40 years you’ll have ~$2.4 million
30 years you’ll have ~$1.1 million
20 years you’ll have ~$500,000

Same as above with $100 will result in:

20 years ~$50,000
30 years ~$110,000
40 years ~$240,000

In OPs post of $100 a week (calling it $400 a month) with the same criteria as above:

40 years ~$1,000,000
30 years ~$450,000
20 years ~$200,000

2021-05-14 13:54:03,stocks,it's $100/week so roughly $433/mo which is close to the max contribution for an IRA. Still not enough to get you rich in a 30-year time horizon though.

7% sort of allows for some down years and is a more realistic number to reach consistently. There was no rhyme or reason except I think it’s a fair estimate that errors in the side of being conservative.

I asked 4 questions, that I thought were pretty simple for people in the business, but you're the only one in the comments actually trying to answer any of them. Do you know anything about investing groups and you'd be able to give me a better insight into how they work?"
2021-05-14 14:24:57,stocks,"Well the 7% return is based on the S&P 500 Index. A grouping of 500 of the largest companies in the US.

That tends to be considered safe. It’s also not likely to go up 70% in a year like some handpicked stocks might. It also won’t go down 70% like some individual stocks might.

Another index is the NASDAQ - which is 100 tech stocks

The DJIA is 30 companies.

S&P - being 500 companies - tends to be the most “safe” of the three. But generally speaking - if you’re in an ETF that follows any of those three - you’re being fairly conservative.

There are ETF’s that mirror those indices. You’ll see SPY and VOO (S&P), QQQ (NASDAQ), and j honestly don’t know any ETF’s that track the DOW. They exist - but I’m in S&Ps and NASDAQ. 

Again - generally speaking - if you’re in an ETF that mirrors one of these three - you’re being fairly safe and conservative. Check the link I posted to give you an idea of what SPY or VOO might return year over year."
2021-05-14 14:38:18,stocks,"The reason people aren't answering your questions is because it is clear from your post that you essentially know nothing about investing, there's nothing wrong with that you're just getting started. But the answers to those questions aren't as straight forward as you think they are and you're essentially asking us to explain the entire industry of investing to you and then get mad when we don't. But as a good faith effort I will give you direct answers to those questions:

>1) is such a strategy really worth it?

Yes, it is the most basic strategy basically everyone uses to save for retirement.

>2) if so what companies are worth putting your money into long term?

Ones that will give you good long term returns, identifying which ones those are is literally a billion dollar question. If you don't want to have to worry about if the companies you picked are the right ones then buy index funds.

>3) should I go on the market alone [via robinhood] or perhaps use some investment groups?

I don't know what you mean by investment groups, maybe a financial advisor? In which case it depends on the level of your assets, do you have $1 million? In your case yes your should probably talk to a financial advisor. Are you literally just gonna do $100/week like you say in the post? Do it on your own, but don't use robinhood. Use Fidelity, Schwab, or Vanguard.

>4) side question, how investment groups actually work? Are they giving you any warranties such as 'if you lose, you'll get back 80% of your deposits back?""

Again I don't know what you mean by investment groups but absolutely no one will give you a warranty when it comes to investing in stocks. The risk is the reason it gives better returns than say a savings account.

2021-05-14 14:34:23,stocks,"My personal advice is unless you’re going to be actively researching things and reading earnings reports and stuff - stick it in an ETF and keep adding to it.

ETF= Exchange Traded Fund. It’s a basket of stocks that you invest in the basket, not individual stocks. That basket holds things like Apple, Microsoft, Target, Walmart, Pepsi, MMM, Home Depot, etc - think the biggest companies and brands you see and use regularly. But you aren’t picking and choosing individual stocks. You’re capping your upside, but you’re also heavily limiting your downside. Generally when someone says “the market is up” they’re talking about the S&P.

I am pretty heavy in QQQM - which mirrors the NASDAQ (tech heavy - biggest holdings are: Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Facebook, Tesla, NVidia, PayPal, and Comcast). I think tech is the future and will continue to grow exponentially over the next 30 years.

Of course - the S&P holds those stocks as well - but at a lower percentage of their holdings.

QQQM has 11.2% of their holdings are Apple (their largest holding), VOO meanwhile has 5.74% of their holdings in Apple (their largest holding)."

So yea, if you're looking for long term hold, general consensus is AMD will perform. Buying as a short term trend looks dangerous since the stock has been on a drastic downtrend for a while.

It rhymes with bripto furrency.  The semiconductor manufacturers are selling all of their capacity to the miners, because it is profitable to mine right now, and they are paying top dollar for the chips.  For that reason supply will be constrained limiting the growth of companies that have not already secured manufacturing time in the foundries.  

In the past this has been the case with CPU's and GPU's but with the growth of ARM as a general purpose ISA,it is affecting Electric vehicles, regular vehicles, and even the companies that make semiconductor manufacturing equipment.

I've even heard Intel are switching to TSMC for their chips.  Its really a weird situation, where Intel is teetering on brink of removing the small number of advantages they have left, in order to stay competitive with AMD.

Its gearing up for a very dirty fight with OEM/Fabs, a price war, and you have cloud giants in the background slowly shifting to SaaS and using non-x86 architecture.  Google saw the future of the office a decade ago with Chromebooks and GSuite."
2021-05-14 15:50:07,stocks,"AMD has been supplying the chips for consoles for a while now not just this generation, so it's priced in. Beware ""they're doing better than Intel > they'll dominate down the line"" if you're looking for a long term hold. They've been better than Intel before, and proceeded to shit the bed right after for almost a decade. The same could have been said of Intel a couple years ago and look where they are now.

What I'm wary of with AMD and Intel anyways is ARM. All the big players in the servers are making their own ARM designs, Apple just made one for consumers, Microsoft is making one. If Nvidia manages to buy ARM imo it's game over for Intel and AMD in the server and consumer chip market."

I would say Intel is a better stock right now then AMD because Intel has product, and AMD product is hard to find.  I still think Intel has problems as a company, for example, why is intel not all over this shortage and designing drop in replacements using their fabs to build hurry up replacement product, and still looking at the industry like everything is a PC running x86?

Markets are not rational so logic might not apply to the stock price.

Who buys the product doesn't affect how much they can make (other than semi manufacturing equipment companies). Companies affected by the shortage, like GM or Dell should be losing out on profits, but AMD, Intel, Nvidia, Texas Instruments, etc should be solid imo."
2021-05-14 14:09:29,stocks,"Your logic doesn't make sense when talking about major chip companies. 

There is no way that a brypto chip manufacturer is going to outcompete AMD or Apple for production time (apple sold 200+million iphones alone last year with several custom chips in each).  It is also highly unlikely any of them are going to be at the same node size as high end chips due to shear expense, meaning production would not even be in the same foundry.

No one mines with cpus alone and while I wish people would mine with ARM chips for the power efficiency, no one is going to mine with arm either unless you're talking about some random teen at home trying it out for the first time on an M1 Mac."

[https://blog.bitmain.com/en/category/cryptocurrency-news/](https://blog.bitmain.com/en/category/cryptocurrency-news/)

`Foundry: Hardware Becomes the Focus of Bitcoin Mining Race`  
  
`Michael Colyer, CEO of Foundry, the cryptocurrency mining subsidiary of Digital Currency Group (DCG), shared his observations and predictions on the current mining market. He said that due to the continuous advancement of Bitcoin mining technology, the mining industry’s demand for chips is competing with other cutting-edge technology companies such as Samsung and Apple, resulting in insufficient global chip supply and a situation of grabbing chip resources. Meanwhile, institutional miners have entered the game, making it harder for people to get miners, and resulting in more competition as intuitions have strong access to investments.`"
2021-05-14 16:02:21,stocks,"You completely missed the point.  The fabs only have so many hours a year to build the processors, it doesn't matter what type of processors they are building.  Right now a huge amount of that time is taken up building chips for the miners, because the miners are paying top dollar for the time.  The high price of block chain is why they are able to do this.  This situation will not change until the price of block chain comes down."

2021-05-14 16:45:02,stocks,"Are they? They started work on one a while back but it was abandoned last news I heard. They'll still have the rights yes but if Nvidia owns ARM and puts their insane resources and engineers behind making ARM chips anyways, in parallel to Apple, MS and co already building their OS to work on ARM, why wouldn't they enter the desktop, laptop and server markets? They'd be the best positioned for ARM SoCs."

2021-05-14 17:51:03,stocks,"Again makes no sense when talking about major chip companies.  There are two things brypto mining businesses can do, buy chips or make chips.

Mining is overwhelmingly GPU based. The higher the demand for brypto, the higher the demand for GPUs which, although AMD's aren't great will lead to more buyership for AMD + Nvidia's GPUs.  You can see this reflected in history when brypto soared in 2017 and Nvidia followed suit.

In terms of making chips, yes this will take up fab time from other companies, but it's not going to take it away from major semiconductor companies.  If you can show me a brypto asic that's producing over 50mil units then sure it'll compete with the likes of AMD fab volume, but I've never heard of such a company.   Instead, it's going to be competing with similar product size groups like other small startups for fab time.  Creating a mask design and going through multiple rounds of tapeout and debug is extremely expensive and time consuming on the fab's side (several millions in investment), so they will always prioritize large scale customers over small scale to maximize profit."
2021-05-14 17:13:59,stocks,"Same as all the Nvidia complaints, people love to boo hoo about unavailable awesome top of the line just launched product availability and how it means the company must be trash.

My 3060Ti is a better value than the 970 I also bought at launch and had to wait for the backorder then too! 

If 2 weeks waiting is to much delayed gratification for some, it definitely doesn't bode well for their ""investment"" planning.

2021-05-14 13:05:32,stocks,A lot of the money doesn't go anywhere.  It just disappears.  One day the collective assessment of the market is a stock is worth $100.  The next day the belief is it is worth $90.  10% of the money in the stock can disappear overnight with only a few trades to mark its evaporation.
2021-05-14 13:14:36,stocks,"There is no actual money in the market itself - a stock with 100M shares at $10 each doesn't have a billion in cash in it - it just means the last exchange took place at $10.  We value it at 1B, but as economists say the value of something is not what was paid for it but what the owner is willing to accept to part with it.  


A bearish market means a drop in confidence, not a disappearance of money."
2021-05-14 13:19:26,stocks,"I think a lot of people are reading your title without reading your post. They're assuming you're asking what happens to all the money when the stock market as a whole loses value, when it sounds like what you're really asking is what do people put their money in after they sell their stocks in this current market environment.

My personal opinion is that we are currently seeing a lot of money chasing too few opportunities. In general, companies don't need investor money as much as they used to. It used to be (30+ years ago) that for a company to make money they had to have a bunch of factories, equipment, and personnel. That all took a lot of capital which they would raise from investors. Nowadays you have companies like Facebook and Google, which still require capital, but nowhere near the degree to which companies of their size would have 50 years ago. As a result, you have companies requiring less investment, and people with boatloads of money looking to invest. That is generally driving the price of all investments higher and higher, personally I think we're gonna see some really meh returns in the coming decades."

2021-05-14 19:21:21,stocks,">So where does the money go when the market turns bearish?

imagine you bought two assets. doesn't matter what, as long as it's a physical item for the example. 2 paintings, 2 cars, 2 houses, etc. you buy them and hope to resell for a profit. 

one item you can sell for double your purchase price. you earned a 100% profit. but the other item, you can't sell. nobody wants it. 

where did your money go? well, your money went to the purchase of assets. one of the assets gained in value, the other lost its value. it's not like your money vanished into thin air. you traded your money for something else. but because a stock isn't like a diamond ring, you make a false mental connection that it somehow is like money in a bank account."
2021-05-14 12:56:54,stocks,"When you buy a stock, someone else is selling it. If a stock loses value, that's because there are more people trying to sell it then buy it, which drives the price lower. The only time money changes hands is when a transaction happens. If your portfolio is red, and you don't sell, there is no change of money. If you sell at a loss, then you simply paid more for your stock then you sold it for. The person you bought it from got your money, and the person you sold it to gave you their money."

This is a perfect articulation of what I was trying to drive at. Thank you! I'm certainly learning a lot from the thread and people's interpretations of what I meant. 

I agree with your analysis. I remember thinking something along those lines when I learned Apple was sitting on $50 B in cash and didn't know what to do with it (I could have lent them some ideas). It's going to be an interesting ride into (what I hope will be) the post-scarcity world."

2021-05-14 13:51:32,stocks,"This isn’t accurate. When you buy a stock, you buy it from a brokerage/market maker. When you sell, you sell to a brokerage/market maker. That’s why there is a difference in the bid and ask—that’s one of the primary means of profit for the brokerage/market maker."
2021-05-14 15:50:17,stocks,"I'm not interested in where ""my"" money goes when my specific portfolio loses value. Looking at it in the aggregate, there is a flow of value in and out of certain products that is reflective of the price of those products. When the total value of the stock market goes down it is because there has been a transfer of money at lower valuations of the underlying asset than previously. More selling pressure. That decrease in value is equal to the money transacted that did not then flow back into another stock asset. After-all, the DOW doesn't move at all if I sell $1000 CVX and buy $1000 XOM (Note: This requires some assumptions about price discovery and liquidity, but I think the assumptions are fair).

So, if the total value of all stocks goes down that value extraction must go somewhere. Immediately it is deposited in the accounts of investors in the form of money, but then ... is it put right back in the market, or does it go into other assets like commodities, real estate, commercial products paid for by that money? 

That's my question. Sorry if I wasn't clear enough in the post, but the question is really fascinating to me. In a bear market, the value is displaced from the market for a long period of time. I'm curious to know if any meta analyses exists on where that money is put. It's certainly still true that in times of volatility precious metals increase in value as a decent value capture mechanism, but not nearly all the money goes there."

2021-05-14 17:36:47,stocks,"Not an option for a lot of people who may be on low incomes. In some cases, people might have lived in the area their whole lives because it was ""The affordable area"" - then ya boi Kev came along,  bought houses (constraining supply and boosting prices) and made it unviable for them to live there. In some cities, there just isn't an affordable area. 

And with regards to maintenance etc, getting my landlord to do repairs and maintenance was an absolute nightmare when I rented as a student. I have no idea who you've met who doesn't eventually want to own a home that they can pass on to children/have as an emergency asset. 

If you rent your whole life, you're basically going to end up paying some parasite about as much as it would cost to buy a house - what idiot wants that? Only the person who gets paid to sit there and earn ""passive income"" benefits. Its not ""entitlement"" to not want to be a serf to a landlord"
2021-05-14 17:59:20,stocks,"Many people are happy to rent and pile money into the market that would otherwise go to a down payment or repairs. There's been studies done that show in far more cases than we'd think it's better to rent than own based purely on the numbers. 

Oftentimes they're not in one place long enough to even break even as I mentioned, which is roughly 5 + years before owning versus renting makes financial sense. 

I completely understand the notion of wanting to stay near family and where you grew up. I grew up in the bay area and had to move an hour inland to afford housing. I don't blame anyone for it, it's just the mechanics of capitalism and suppy and demand. I don't believe I'm owed the ability to live where I want. 

Would be great if they allowed more housing without making it expensive or outright not worth the time for builders to run through all the tape California has. I love the state but there's a lot that needs to be fixed. It should start with trying to meet the growing needs of people and not just limiting who's buying existing inventory. 

That said, I wouldn't mind seeing a limit on rentals, such as no out of state landlords or large fund investments. I have no problem with mom and pop rentals though."

2021-05-14 16:22:32,stocks,"Its ""potential"" is a decade away from being realized. Hard to say the market doesnt agree with you when none of the things its supposed to do have happened yet.

Dont worry about short term fluctuations in price, if you bought the stock hoping to become a trillionaire overnight, you bought it for the wrong reasons. Anyone buying this stock should do so with the intention of holding it for at least 5 years, maybe 15, maybe even 20 before it become the trillion dollar juggernaut people think it will.

The same holds true if it DOES rip upward in the short term. If it quadrupled in price next week you have to have the conviction not to sell.

Theres a lot of original amazon investors who got in at $50 and sold at $150 after 3x'ing  their money. If they had the wherewithal to hang on to it long term they would  be up 60x. Even if you bought at $50 and held till now i think you would be crazy to sell. Amazon still has another decade of strong growth with everything theyre getting into. Wait till wide adoption of drone deliveries and the full power of AWS is unleashed, not to mention the potential of their streaming video, and amazon brand items. Still has a TON more growth to realize over the next 10 years.

The big questions will be how well they can break into the commercial sector and scale down for mid size businesses. If they pull that off this will be a monster.

Needless to say, it’s still an insanely great buy. Right now it’s at such a steal. It’s just gonna take some time before it takes off. It’s ridiculously innovative, has no competitors, and is snatching up contracts left and right. It has demonstrated growth.

Do not listen to the people talking about it not making a profit. It’s been around for a while and guess what? Data has never been as big as it is now. And it will only get more and more important. The company will continue to grow, numbers will continue to improve, and this stock will continue to grow and grow. When? Who knows. 

I think it’s a bit strange that everyone suddenly is focusing on its valuation. Meanwhile there’s plenty of overvalued stocks people love to pump and pump. Tesla is the perfect example. Give it time. It’s a solid buy."

2021-05-14 14:33:31,stocks,"1st of all separate the hype from reality. The hype the last 20 years is every ipo wants to somehow be a tech company. So everyone is calling themselves tech. Its semantics and not reflective of reality.

2nd, understand that AI is not really AI. It was redefined the last 10 years or so to include things that traditional were not considered AI. They are simply statistics. Thats all. We analyze stats then program a computer to do something specific. There is absolutely no intelligence involved. ML is not AI and never will be. It can lead to AI one day but on its own it isnt. Think about the cells of your body. They have functions. They are important. Are they intelligent? No they arent. Will they ever be intelligent? Nope. So why do companies go out of their way to claim AI? See #1 above.

3rd, if you dont work in tech, you really shouldnt be talking about tech. All software companies work with data. Size of data isnt really as big of a deal as people make it out to be. ""Big Data"" is just marketing hype and has been for at least a decade now. There was a time when processing large data was hard. That was 20-50 years ago... big data means nothing now. Its literally trivial to do and cheap especially when we are talking non-science researchy stuff.

Last, know your industry. What exactly do you think all the other defense contractors do these days? Manufacture weapons? Nope. Mostly software services... aka they put a GUI on data. Exactly the same thing these guys are doing. I was doing similar work for Raytheon more than 10 years ago at Irwin.

Summary: They are a plain old defense contractor. Nothing wrong with that, but they are not really a tech company unless you count all the other defense contractors as ""tech."" Semantics... See #1 above."

I wouldn't use a commission free based brokerage simply because I'm Canadian and if I'm buying American stocks, the conversation to USD is horrible.

Outside of that, nothing to worry about really."
2021-05-14 11:56:20,stocks,">i dont understand why I know something happend a little while back correct?

It's happened since the GME event as well.  Basically, you are the product with Robinhood.  They sell your data (ie: what you research, what you are interested in buying, what you buy) back to hedge funds that use that to make market moves.

Additionally, they have halted buying/selling in extreme situations in favor of big money over their customers."

They are partially owned by hedge funds that had a large short position in GME. They also had a liquidity issue that was a part of it (because they are a shit company) and their CEO went around on TV lying saying they didn’t. You are not their main main customer, you are their product. They make the vast majority of their money from selling your transaction data to hedge funds. Basically they fucking suck and protect hedge funds over their users"
2021-05-14 16:18:43,stocks,"the backlash against robinhood by in large is just typical internet circlejerk where it's trendy to hate on something, most of it coming from people who couldn't even explain why they don't like it.

robinhood does have some issues they need to sort out, but the hatred people have for it stems from when gamestop blew up and the clearing houses told robinhood ""if you want to allow trading of this stock, we're requiring you to have a larger collateral than you do, and you aren't allowed to use money in customer accounts towards that figure"".

robinhood didn't have the absurd amount of money that was being asked of them, so they had to suspend trading on the stocks.

as far as robinhood goes,

the good:

* it has a nice beginner interface for people learning
* it has EXTREMELY low margin rates (not to mention it's a flat rate, so you don't need to have hundreds of thousands of dollars of margin to get the best rate)
* no commissions on options


the bad:

* their signup bonus is kind of crap
* they have a lot to desire in terms of peak uptime. they have had some server outages at the worst possible times. (that being said, outages can happen to any brokerage, so the right answer to so simply use a few different ones)

personally, schwab is my favorite (and what i started out with), but robinhood is fine."
2021-05-14 12:27:52,stocks,"I’m also very new to this and in a similar situation.

When you sign up for RobinHood it says, ""I understand that Robinhood may, at any time, in its sole discretion and without any prior notice to me, prohibit or restrict my ability to trade securities.""

I’m not putting my time, efforts and money into a stock knowing RobinHood could basically deactivate  my sell button as they please. 

I just opened both a fidelity and Ameritrade TD account to try out. 

Think or Swim app is the same as AmeritradeTD so your portfolios are the same in both apps, one is just more suited of options. (You have to buy full shares here, I think, no partial stocks) Same log in for both apps as well. 

I initiated a full account transfer through Ameritrade TD and it will take 4-5 business days to complete. I started yesterday and my RobinHood account is already deactivated. I got emails from both stating transfer is in process. 

RobinHood charges $75 for this, a lot of places will comp or reimburse it though. 

I haven’t explored or deposited on fidelity yet but I hear good things

Anyways hope this helps"

That fine was levied in part on how they receive their revenue- payment for order flow. Their order flow is fulfilled by market makers like Citadel, and every execution of a trade has a buy/sell spread. Robinhood not executing at the best price meant tiny profits were siphoned from each order that should have instead lowered their customers' cost basis."

MX is being bought out and going private. Shareholders will receive 29/share. Current price is 22.xx. The board approved the buyout in march. All that is left is a shareholder vote and standard regulatory approvals. Supposed to occur in the latter half of 2021.

I recently put 5k (35% of portfolio) into this with an average cost of 23.76. And now it’s dipped even lower to where returns are approaching 30% at the current price. 

I’m still fairly new so I’ve not seen this happen yet with stocks I’m I hold. How unlikely is this not to go through? I can’t imagine shareholders would vote against free money. Is it common such buyout is not approved by the SEC? It seems like this is a pretty good investment now."

2021-05-14 00:00:00,stocks,"Helpful Sources for Understanding the Lumber Industry and the Value of Lumber Companies Based on questions I've been getting the last couple weeks, I want to share all the various sources I’ve used to keep myself educated on the industry and get my “feel” for long term exit strategies.

This post isn’t about doing EPS or IV projections.  It’s simply about how you can keep doing ongoing research about the general direction and prices of lumber the commodity, as well as any major news/opinions out there that could affect the commodity’s future direction.  

I find it **very** helpful, because on weeks like this one where everyone lost their fucking minds because the price of used cars went up a bit, I held strong because in the end I knew the CPI report and the panic selling that followed didn’t change the market fundamentals driving the lumber industry’s record profits.  I didn’t panic when futures went red the last few days, because I know how well these companies will do even if lumber prices drops another 30% and I knew that the cash markets were doing just fine.  So this “market feel” research helps you have confidence in your investment so you can ignore the daily noise.

**Basic Links for understanding the Current State of Lumber Industry**

I think it will be helpful for people to know exactly why lumber is surging and the market dynamics that caused it, because you can then use that to make educated guesses at whether your various companies still have long term value and have confidence in your investment when the fundamentals are still there.

Here are two excellent podcasts from two industry insiders discussing the current state of the industry:

[Odd Lots Podcast with Deacon Lumber CEO Stinson Dean](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/why-the-price-of-lumber-has-soared-day-after-day-after-day/id1056200096?i=1000518629853)

[Building Optimal Podcast with Dustin Jalbert; Fastmarkets RISI Senior Economist; Episode #71]( https://buildingoptimal.com/episodes/)

Both are great podcasts to help you understand what’s causing the surge from the people that know.  Hint: it’s not due to an industry-wide conspiracy.  This will help you start to figure out whether you should stick with your investment when lumber dips from it’s high after the summer.


**Apparently Social Media Actually has a Positive Use**

I don’t use social media, but I got a twitter account for work related reconnaissance and then found out that a handful of extremely knowledge people in the lumber industry are tweeting at each other non-stop about things going on in the cash markets / futures, as well as the occasional opinions.  These people often post articles on the area or new podcasts.  So it’s a great way to keep yourself educated.  Also, they are just good people and it can be entertaining to see what’s going on with them any particular day.

It can be insightful (and calming on red days), especially since normal members of the public can’t see what’s happening in the cash markets real time, but sometimes these guys will let you know.  The other day, when all the futures were nose diving, cash markets were still up, meaning the immediate price of lumber was doing just fine and it the red was really from the speculators jumping ship (which is a good thing!).

[Deacon Lumber CEO Stinson Dean](https://twitter.com/LumberTrading?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) – The King of Lumber Twitter.  Nice guy and great insights.  Don’t ask him what the price of lumber will be in Q4.  No one fucking knows.  

[RISI Senior Economist Dustin Jalbert](https://twitter.com/2x4caster) – Also a very prolific poster in Lumber Twitter and will share great insights.

[Forestry Insider Bryan Davis](https://twitter.com/bryandav1z) – Another knowledgeable insider who likes to share insights on the industry and some of the main lumber stocks.

[Housing expert/Chief Economist Ali Wolf](https://twitter.com/AliWolfEcon) – The housing market is driving this surge.  The lumber industry uses housing demand/data as the canary in the coal mind.  You probably should too.  If housing demand is still going bananas, then lumber will do so as well.

[Madison’s Lumber Prices](https://twitter.com/LumberNews?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) – They post Lumber Cash Prices, typically about 2 weeks behind, but that’s still way ahead of whenever the company’s next earnings statements, and provides a break down by the major types of lumber.  Sometimes you even get a video interview/update.

[RISI Analyst Bryan Smith](https://twitter.com/bryansmithrisi?lang=en) – He tweets out when some of these forestry companies declare wood pulp price increases (which extra is a significant source of income for a lot of these companies).  I find it a helpful data point.

Those are main ones.  But if you follow these people enough, you will see them talking to other insightful people as well and sharing informative content.

**Publicly Open Websites That Help You get a Sense of Market Direction**

Here’s the link for lumber futures: [CME Lumber Futures](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/agricultural/lumber-and-pulp/random-length-lumber.html#) - This is the closest thing to a general market gauge of the lumber industry.  But this isn’t an exact predictor and this price is pegged to the Western SPF KD 2x4 #2&Btr.  There are many different types of dimensional lumber, some cost more (like Eastern SPF) and some cost less (like Southern Yellow Pine – SYP).  But this can help you get a sense what the future outlook may look like generally.  But remember, these prices can change.  They can go up or down, these aren’t guarantees of the future price of lumber.  Just because January futures trading at 1100 doesn’t mean it will stay that way.

[Nasdaq Lumber futures Graph](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/commodities/lbs) – a nice little graph showing the general price of lumber futures at the time of each expiration.  Helps you get an idea for where we are historically.  Why is this important?  Because you can look at the 2018 levels, see how well these companies did then.  If our current price is HIGHER than the 2018 peak, then you really don’t need to panic.  

The industry’s breakeven price is generally around $400 mfbm.  2018 hit $600 for three weeks and it was a great year for them.  So maybe you don’t need to panic sell when the futures dip below **$1200** from their $1600/1700 peak.  What matters is where it settles.  Also, you can see that in 2020, the Price dropped hard and came right back up because demand was still booming like crazy.

[Madison’s Lumber Reports]( https://madisonsreport.com/) If you hate twitter, here’s another way to look at cash prices for the main types of lumber.  Again, the free stuff is typically about 1.5-2 weeks old.

[US Housing Data Releases](https://www.census.gov/construction/nrc/pdf/newresconst.pdf) – US Census release new data typically the third week of every month, posting the data from the prior month.  This is a HUGE stat in the lumber industry.  It helps you see what home construction rates will look like now and in the coming months (due to housing permit numbers which precede starts by 2-3 months).  When the number drops month after month, don’t panic. Make sure you consider other sources for context.  But a large drop over time, that’s when you know the party is over.

[Shanghai Pulp futures](https://www.barchart.com/futures/quotes/VLH21/futures-prices) – This isn’t lumber.  But most of the lumber companies also produce wood pulp and it makes up a large part of their income when doing well.  This is the closest thing to a price indicator for the general wood pulp market.  There are many different types of wood pulps, of varying price, but this is turning into a decent gauge of the general direction of the wood pulp market.  [Here’s a recent publication praising it and giving you more info on the current pulp market.](https://www.fastmarkets.com/Media/Files/PRA/FMV2/pdfs/Promotional%20materials/The_future_of_China_pulp_futures.pdf)

**Non-Lumber Specific Tools**

[Open Insider](http://openinsider.com/) is a website that lets you look up the insider buying/selling of any stock.  

[Whale wisdom](https://whalewisdom.com/) is another excellent website that lets you look and see which hedge funds own the stock your looking at.  Lets you know are they buying or selling en masse, calls or puts.  It gets their data from 13-F’s so it isn’t real time but it is a helpful data point nonetheless.

Overall, there is a lot of publicly available information that you can use to inform yourself on how the industry is going and if the immediate future is looking good or bad.  It may be a good idea to look at prior earnings presentations in whatever company your invested during the periods lumber was up, and see how they did at those prices.  That will help you gauge whether these companies will still do great even when lumber prices drop below $1K, because at some point they will.  Monetary policy/QE is not causing this.

If there is one place you *shouldn’t* go for insights on lumber stocks/industry, it’s Motley Fool / CNBC or frankly any of the tops results from google.  That free content is dogshit.  You can look at my post history to see how horribly off the mark these free websites are in recommending “lumber stocks.”  You are not the customer in their eyes, you are the product.  Keep that in mind.

**TLDR:** there is a lot of simple, free stuff out there to help you evaluate your investments or whether you should invest in lumber companies.  I am not a financial analyst or an industry insider.  Do your own research and make your own decisions.  Don’t panic sell because some internet dipshits who know nothing of this industry are calling the peak (but not backing that talk up with puts).  Don’t FOMO buy just because “the sucker’s going up.”

**Disclosure:** most of the stock I hold is in RFP, but I also hold some WFG and LPX.  Anyone have thoughts on what they like more LPX vs WFG long term (the next 6-18 months), please share and why.  I can’t decide which I want to buy more of.  For the Canfor/Interfor Bros out there, I don’t need to hear how cheap your otc stock is. :p"
2021-05-14 17:17:43,stocks,"Great post thanks dude. 

I'll be honest. You are my primary conduit into all these resources. I Saw your DD on RFP and liked the thesis made a lot of sense. I ended up buying in the day before earnings lol. Not once thought about selling though. I will double check what you have linked above occasionally and will definitely  listen to those podcasts. But for me when the market is down the 1st place I look to see what's going on interims of wood market is your post history. Don't feel any pressure now I am not in over my head at all, I will be fine if you or RFP vanish tomorrow. I just say that to say you are part of the cycle (at least for me) thank you. People are watching and appreciating your regular updates on wood in general and RFP in particular."
2021-05-14 12:50:20,stocks,"WY is missing from your list, otherwise I agree there is limited upside on all these stocks now unless you're hoping for special dividend announcements."
2021-05-14 18:15:59,stocks,"You just shared plenty of new resources for the millions of people on r/stocks, yet no one's interested because lumber isn't as sexy as tech. I appreciate this post, you're an asset to this community. 

Sucked to see RFP red on such a green day like today, hopefully we see a boost this summer. With such a low PE (if they hit their estimated earnings) I'm hopeful that we see this break into the 20s by the end of the summer, assuming the futures move in our favor."
2021-05-14 19:28:00,stocks,"Thank you. I appreciate that. :) 

It probably will be a bumpy summer, but if housing construction stays strong like it is projected to and pulp stays strong as well, the market can’t ignore the cash flow forever. They tried to February and march, and then came April and the market couldn’t ignore the economic indicators anymore."
2021-05-14 13:07:30,stocks,"I didnt buy any WY because a large part of its value is from its land and Timber. Also, by the time i started investing in these cyclicals, WY had the highest valuation ratios because CNBC has been spamming the stock non stop. I’m glad I didn’t because It has had the worse price performance of all the forestries.

I agree there is limited upside. The easy money has been made. The future upside depends on what lumber prices are looking like in the fall and 2022. Im cautiously bullish because the demand will still out pace supply, but not enough to buy any new calls. Need to see what the price settles on after July."
2021-05-14 19:23:00,stocks,"RFP had a rough week. All the forestries struggling with futures going red from that ridiculous spike up. It’s stupid because The random length composites are up for next week. Pulp is up and will have a much bigger impact on Q2 earnings, but that’s even more boring than lumber. In the end, the cash will win out. Patience is a virtue. :)"
2021-05-14 13:36:14,stocks,"> what lumber prices are looking like in the fall and 2022

I expect they'll still be high, but we're probably already priced in with that assumption.

Pine Beatle's are a huge problem in the PNW

Lots of land has been burnt in the seasonal forest fires, I'd expect we'll have another burn unless this is a very wet summer...

Gloabal supply can't meet the NA demands, we're usually a net exporter and they suffer similar problems with land rights, pests, and fires.

There's also some neat opportunities for using cellulose as raw material in environmentally friendly ways that I see as a huge opportunity for future growth.

Keep a close eye on lumber futures, you're probably right by July it'll be a clear signal to get out or double down."
2021-05-14 14:22:49,stocks,"I agree higher for longer is likely given the housing demand situation. But i don’t think it’s priced in. The projections on the forestries’ EPS for Q3, Q4, and 2022 are extremely low compared to Q1, which had average lumber transaction prices around 850-875. So the current surge is priced in, and i think the big money in the market doesn’t care about Q2’s insane surge which is likely seen as a single windfall. But higher for longer (meaning over 600$) isn’t priced in to analyst projections."
2021-05-14 00:00:00,stocks,"Similar fund holdings in 401k vs. taxable account? Hey folks, here’s my question. My 401k is 100% in FXAIX, but I also hold 60% VTI in my taxable account. Should my taxable be more focused toward other funds since I already contribute regularly to FXAIX in my 401k and the funds are similar? I've had my 401k for about 7 years but my taxable is only about 6 months old, and I'm just curious if the money I’m regularly putting into VTI would be better utilized elsewhere or if people commonly have two different accounts with similar funds. Perhaps sell my VTI & buy VT instead, since FXAIX has no international exposure?"
2021-05-14 11:25:42,stocks,I leaned slightly harder on reits on my non taxable account since it benefits the most from tax treatment.
2021-05-14 11:41:18,stocks,"Some international exposure is probably a good idea if you don't hold any in your 401k, looks like VT is 45% foreign?

General recommendations for foreign stock holdings range around  15-25% of your portfolio  


instead of VT you could hold more in VTI has it has a lower expense ratio and buy a vanguard fund specifically intended for international stocks such as VXUS

This way you can control the allocation % in foreign stocks and reduce your expense ratio for holding US stock"
2021-05-14 11:56:54,stocks,"I actually have VXUS in taxable (very little, I add to it as I can but my cash reserves are low at the moment) so I'm not completely devoid of international exposure. My thoughts are though, that I already have 100% US-based S&P holdings in my 401k, so VTI feels redundant in my taxable account. I imagine I would save a little on expense ratios by only holding VT though, no?"
2021-05-14 12:17:34,stocks,"if you were to take your VTI holdings ( .03% expense ratio), sell 45% and buy VXUS ( .08% expense ratio)

you would have very similar allocations to selling all of your VTI and buying all VT ( .08% expense ratio) except your US holdings would only have .03 expense ratio in VTI vs .08 in VT

In other words you end up paying .08 instead of .03 for vanguard to hold US stocks for you"

As a small investor, I feel that time arbitrage is one of my only advantages over the big guys, so I don't believe I would benefit much from daily stock news or briefs.

For my research, I do read the free SA articles among many other sources of writeups and ideas, but I don't really read as much about stocks that I already own. I'll rather invest that time in looking for new, possibly better ideas.

I'm not saying just buy and forget, but most ideas take time to play out and at that point it might even be better to restrict your intake to actual information such as 10Ks from the company itself and/or significant, obvious developments in the stock price. The problem with analyst ratings and reports etc is that stuff can influence your conviction but it could turn out to be just other people's opinions i.e. noise."

Honestly it's pretty much tea leaves anyways though, any ticker will have a bull and a bear, sometimes the same guy posting 3 or 4 bull/bear articles.

You should be allowed to flip the money as many times as you want but you can't hold more than $100k at any given time - and that can fluctuate if you held positions overnight and Tastyworks doesn't do intraday release on those funds. 

Either way, the brokers system should track your buying power and not allow you to go over. It's possible that the call isn't legit. It's worth talking to them to see if they can lift it. You may be stuck on the sidelines for a day or two while they sort it out but it's better than going through the process of changing brokers.

If it is legit - you should simply change brokers. Tastyworks has to either restrict your account or you have to meet the call, but if you change brokers all that gets wiped away. r/daytrading will have good insight on good brokers for day traders."

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

2021-05-14 16:03:44,stocks,The people who paper handed yesterday probably feel really good today 😂
2021-05-14 11:14:07,stocks,was down 9% now down 5%. progress!
2021-05-14 13:17:17,stocks,Surprised at how well DIS is recovering from this mornings sell off.
2021-05-14 05:40:48,stocks,green day to end the week come on 🙏
2021-05-14 10:51:58,stocks,"Index funds portfolio up 13%, individual stocks portfolio -11%."

2021-05-14 11:53:01,stocks,"Anyone who spend some time looking at the actual inflation figures and understanding them knew the last few days of red were completely fake and unwarranted. The 4.2% inflation figure is a complete farce, since comparing to last April during the depths of the coronvirus panic is just stupid. Also the overshoot was mostly on used vehicles due to people going back to work.

The fed isn't going to do a surprise rate hike with that data."
2021-05-14 06:14:14,stocks,"Buy COIN today, I sold it yesterday. It may go down since i told you to buy today"
2021-05-14 07:16:17,stocks,Looks suspiciously green. Is anyone speaking or is there a report that's supposed to be released today that could change it?
2021-05-14 18:43:22,stocks,Does anyone think its good time to load BABA
2021-05-14 12:17:24,stocks,"Whoever sold your entire portfolio at low yesterday, thank you for your sacrifice. You da real mvp"
2021-05-14 07:33:17,stocks,PLUG just reinstated their previous financial statements were ACCURATE hence the 66% drop from ATH could be held hugely overreacted.
2021-05-14 08:34:58,stocks,"I bought into Tesla at 725(my b) heavy.   Do I let it ride or average down?  My thought process is that averaging down any real amount would just have me too risky with so much percent into it.   
Anyone else similar?"
2021-05-14 10:35:04,stocks,Getting absolutely creamed by DIS lmao.
2021-05-14 14:52:03,stocks,You know I really miss January/early Feb where we got days like this many days in a row and not only after we got suplexed for 2-3 days in a row first lol.
2021-05-14 12:59:43,stocks,Clown market randomly decides to fuck over my portfolio over the past week. All of a sudden inflation doesn't matter today. Efficient market my fucking ass.
2021-05-14 06:59:41,stocks,[deleted]
2021-05-14 08:00:05,stocks,What happened to all the inflation FUD? Are we supposed to forget that happened despite US opening back up sooner will probably cause more demand for goods and our supply chain issues still haven't been fixed. Like the chip shortage.
2021-05-14 13:45:53,stocks,"i'm kinda afraid to hold SQ. 

At one point i was up to 270. now it's around 200, but it's considered a growth stock, and this market hates growth stocks from here on out"
2021-05-14 15:11:49,stocks,"so do we think the 2 green days to end the week is just simply ""it can't be red forever"", or do we think this is the result of the CDC's announcement yesterday that people can go back to their normal lives once vaccinated?"
2021-05-14 08:50:48,stocks,"Almost guaranteed that today is the usual pathetically minor green Friday after a blood red week...

These past two weeks have been utterly horrific - came so close to breaking even at the start of it, followed by a plummet so bad that I'm now down twice as much as my previous low. So low that repositioning would just be locking in horrendous losses.

I guess it's time to look away for a month or two"
2021-05-14 10:31:55,stocks,People celebrating being up a few percent on stocks that are down like 30 or more lmao.
2021-05-14 10:10:27,stocks,Tired of schizo tech stocks so I went 100% bank gang.
2021-05-14 10:39:10,stocks,DKNG  lets get to 50
2021-05-14 15:55:36,stocks,Closed my SPY call position just now at 3:20pm before the inevitable end of Friday dump. Hold on to your pants boys. Monday is going to be a wild ride.
2021-05-14 16:18:47,stocks,No offence intended to technical traders but when you hear them talk about stocks is like listening to people talk about horoscope. I believe technicals is effective to find an entry/exit point and you can kinda guess the short term movements. But when they talk about it past 5-6 days is when they sound crazy. Like candlelight patterns determine if something is going to do well? But not the general financials or growth of the company
2021-05-14 08:34:14,stocks,"MoM retail sales 0% vs 1% forcast and 9.7% last month. Arguably it seems bullish for the Nasdaq, but evidently it looks like Nasdaq is unsure what to think.

Edit: Nasdaq doesn't seem to like it."
2021-05-14 09:06:23,stocks,DIS dippers: what’s your entry price today?
2021-05-14 09:24:05,stocks,"Ah yes, I shorted BLNK last night and at this rate I'm only going to break even after EPS misses by 125%. I forgot companies only dump on good earnings in this market"
2021-05-14 09:47:13,stocks,What is wrong with AMD?
2021-05-14 10:03:20,stocks,Seems like a speculative day
2021-05-14 10:05:41,stocks,Happy to see my tickers in green but was also hoping for a good buying opportunity since today is pay day.
2021-05-14 10:09:46,stocks,You guys think DKNG found it's bottom or is there another dip in it's future?
2021-05-14 10:15:00,stocks,"Welp, my DIS calls are basically worthless."
2021-05-14 11:03:30,stocks,"For the past couple weeks every day has been red except Friday, any explanation for this?"
2021-05-14 11:19:44,stocks,"Ive never used margin and frankly think 99% of people shouldnt either... but my question is this. 

Some people have like 100k in margin and ive seen recently more and more people getting margin called. What do these people do? Like what do you do with a 100k margin call? 

Clearly if you are using margin you dont have 100k sitting around. Do they do a payment plan? Do you take a loan out? Bankrupt?"
2021-05-14 11:54:59,stocks,Thinking of buying more DIS. I bought pretty high at 193. Thinking of buying on the dip knowing it’ll likely go up by next year
2021-05-14 12:09:11,stocks,I’ve come to terms that some of my stocks will never be at its ATH which is where I bought. My only solace is that I bought with my stimmy checks so I’ll just pretend I never got the money at all 🙂
2021-05-14 12:34:42,stocks,"Jesus Christ, what happened on DASH?"
2021-05-14 13:30:30,stocks,Gah do I sell my Carnival shares or wait for the return of cruises for a big final boost.  Up 70%.
2021-05-14 15:41:19,stocks,Very low volume(based on their average) on some of the prominent green tickers today. Maybe it doesn't mean anything.
2021-05-14 15:46:53,stocks,"Picked up some DIS @ 173.20, fingers crossed folks. This is a long one for me."
2021-05-14 19:49:01,stocks,About freaking time green day
2021-05-14 13:46:31,stocks,"Everybody else's speculative tech: up 15% today

My speculative tech: best I can do is 5%, and I'm gonna bleed at least half of it away by close."
2021-05-14 08:50:23,stocks,DIS blew up my portfolio. Bought it in 2021. So my entry was 190. This sucks so much I started investing 1 year too late and missed out on the gains. Because I keep seeing people say with every single stock they bought it in 2020 and can ride out this FUD going on right now.
2021-05-14 08:22:24,stocks,"My rebalancing is pretty much done for now and I got a solid cash position to go with it to boot. 

Ready to ride this market come what may. I now have a more grounded outlook and am perfectly ready to not break even for a while but I am confident in my remaining picks after consolidating and just got give it time."
2021-05-14 08:31:29,stocks,Dont celebrate too early
2021-05-14 09:19:38,stocks,Will have a little scalp at PLUG on market open considering their finances are not a mess.
2021-05-14 09:22:47,stocks,How we looking today across the market? I’m scared to check
2021-05-14 10:00:12,stocks,"Fuck yes. Sold my MGM and CZRs

....and CZR went up 2$ immediately...oh well.

Hit my long term gains Today and tired of the rollercoaster.

Bought SCHD and OKE and SCHY with it....feels good.

45% ETF now. All I got left to sell is cruises when they resume"
2021-05-14 10:22:49,stocks,Travel and leisure stocks really seem to be liking that updated mask guidance (and pipeline reopening).
2021-05-14 10:35:03,stocks,SHOULD I SELL TO BREAK EVEN TODAY? /s
2021-05-14 10:38:26,stocks,Ain't seen a rollercoaster like beam yet

2021-05-14 11:52:27,stocks,"Any thoughts on $VIAC? It’s just been sleeping and slowly declining despite having beat earnings. SPY was falling earlier this week and Viacom hardly took a hit, but it’s like the market doesn’t care that the market is moving back up..."

2021-05-14 14:39:54,stocks,"GGB (Gerdau) looks like a decent buy, down today, with good long term potential as steel circles back within the production sector."
2021-05-14 14:40:04,stocks,now... do I sell my AAPL 5/21 125 calls to cut my loss or let it ride  into next week to see if I can break even or maybe even turn a little profit (is that how you spell it?)
2021-05-14 14:45:43,stocks,I bought CRM yesterday.  So far so good.  Near very important turn around prices off a historical support level.
2021-05-14 15:18:19,stocks,Best buys going into next week?
2021-05-14 16:03:55,stocks,Ready for a Monday PM rip and bleed for the rest of the week until friday
2021-05-14 14:49:43,stocks,bears are just taking the day off so they have energy to maul the market on monday
2021-05-14 10:52:54,stocks,Smells like a sweaty bull trap
2021-05-14 12:11:13,stocks,"Some people are calling this the end of the tech wreck, but I don't know. NASDAQ enjoyed some extremely green days out of nowhere in the past few months and the relief I felt then soon turned to disappointment when the sell-off resumed. This feels like one of those days--indiscriminate rises across the board suggests to me that shorters are taking their profits and forcing others to liquidate rather than a genuine buying frenzy."
2021-05-14 12:23:48,stocks,"Wow I'm looking forward to +5% Today only to go down 10% on Monday, like I have for the past 3 months"
2021-05-14 16:24:11,stocks,Nice little bounce up by DKNG. Can't wait for Monday and Tuesday when it drops back down 6-8%.
2021-05-14 14:43:42,stocks,Congrats to anybody that had money left and bought the dip this week
2021-05-14 15:05:00,stocks,I bet we won’t see a Green Day like this for awhile
2021-05-14 16:48:20,stocks,"I was looking at dot-com bubble history and noticed something sort of interesting. When you compare some of the biggest tech companies back then against some of the most hyped up companies today, you can find pretty similar patterns in the price action. 

[For instance, here are two charts of price history (taken from Macrotrends).](https://imgur.com/a/coW0mAd) One is Tesla since just before the pandemic crash. One is Cisco since near the start of the rapid growth of the dot-com bubble until just before the crash. I've removed the axes. Can you tell which is which?"
2021-05-14 11:34:03,stocks,"One thing I'll say is that the past 3 weeks have really taught me a lot about how crucial consolidation is. Most fundamentally sound things go up in the long haul but when you have a ton of positions at once, you're just giving yourself a bigger workload. It's fun when everything soars but when things start going down, you then start panicking wondering what's going on and you don't have as much resources to comfortably average down cause you're spread so thin. 

Discipline is a virtue in this game and a lot of it entails properly assessing a stock and truly being confident to ride it out. And this confidence just seems to reward you more, the less things you got to split your attention between. 

Accordingly I've spent the past few weeks carefully lobbing off things here and there and have just about streamlined my holdings to things I have the greatest confidence in to pan out. Not only will it help me be more steadfast on the next dark day but it'll be that much easier to allocate cash into my various holds the next time I feel comfortable doing so since less holdings make balancing so much easier. 

Yes I am well aware many of the things I parted with will rise long term but I think i'll be better off having to carefully track less things sooner than later. This earnings season was quite an eye opener in that regard. Don't have all your eggs in one basket but don't fill your house with baskets either."
2021-05-14 11:52:21,stocks,"I bought DIS high, used this earnings dip to average down."
2021-05-14 14:45:01,stocks,Mr Market is one bipolar SOB.
2021-05-14 07:31:10,stocks,Going to look to lock in some gains today instead of trying to be greedy if pre-market is any indication of today's action.
2021-05-14 08:22:59,stocks,What’s better if I want to invest in the s&p 500 with vanguard an index fund or their equivalent etf?
2021-05-14 08:58:59,stocks,Spy 400 puts
2021-05-14 10:01:12,stocks,Thoughts on using something like Apple as a cash substitute in my Roth to buy dips? I don’t want to have to sell my vti position again to take advantage of red days.
2021-05-14 11:22:28,stocks,let's end the week on a green note! keep it up!
2021-05-14 11:28:00,stocks,Anyone know what’s happened to MX?

2021-05-14 12:54:50,stocks,"Can someone give me advice on BlackBerry? I bought 200 shares at an average of 14.46CAD(currently it's at 10.16CAD), and it seems to be dropping every day. Should I take the loss and sell?"
2021-05-14 13:35:40,stocks,"Have an XLE aug20 50$ call 5.65$ . Hedged it with a 5/14 55 short call last week and looks like it's expiring OTM. 55$ credit. Still down 30ish bucks on my long. Might roll this long out to December . Or buy shares close to divvie date. Other than that my portfolio is basically 85% vti  15% VXUS. I'm having fun with the market and I feel very comfortable with my portfolio . Looking to hedge this inflation with some long dated SLV calls for fun . If it pans out great, if it doesn't , oh well. Not very stock related but that's where I'm at currently. Only bought in more VTI on this last big dip on my IRA still holding decent amount of cash in both ira and brokerage. Wouldn't mind holding XLE shares for the rest of the year. Think it has some ability to go up , market weighted, pays a good divvie. Do think the market in general has more downside pressure than upside despite today's green-ness though."
2021-05-14 13:48:36,stocks,CZR has been ok through the dip the last few weeks really exciting as they start the William Hill deal in the states

2021-05-14 09:12:51,stocks,"I’ve never seen such ADHD. “I bought X this year and now I’m down, I’m going to liquidate my position”. Stop trying to make short plays and just buy things you understand & like."
2021-05-14 14:51:36,stocks,This is gonna be a repeat of March isn’t it. 1 fantastic day followed by 3 brutal days.
2021-05-14 10:06:29,stocks,I don't think  BABA has a bottom
2021-05-14 10:34:33,stocks,"It's funny the amount of bearish sentiment going through here. A lot of these people will look at everything but the facts. CPI numbers were carried by used car sales, and that showed when PPI numbers came out, with no change from the previous month. Retail sales showed no change from last month, implying that people aren't buying more, and even looking into the numbers, a lot of sectors were down 3-5% within retail sales from last month."
2021-05-14 16:30:27,stocks,"a nice comfy day, hopefully, the good vibes extend into Monday"
2021-05-14 18:22:12,stocks,$COIN at current price: yay or nay?

Looking for tips and opinions on which one might be better. I am also not locked into either of these, I like them because of the high dividend yield and decent growth that I could DRIP."

2021-05-14 11:06:28,stocks,"This could by all means be a bull trap but the problem with that stance is what we've seen happen from late October on in the market, need to keep an open mind because of that.

No, what followed the last week of January for the first part of February isn't normal (one of the market selloff then major bounce back fast examples). But until seen otherwise we have to assume it's possible that this is still the regime.

It's definitely a regime that is nuts, I won't disagree there."
2021-05-14 12:58:25,stocks,"My current strategy in broad lines:

Long on stocks which have been butchered and I think will recover nicely long term (no hyperspeculative crap) like BA and BABA. Short on others I think will keep falling back to earth (put crap here), as NIO and FCEL.

I know mentioning of being short NIO will earn some hate, but hey …

The long positions I tend to hold steady, short ones to go in and out as they swing. Crazy times."

There is no reason for these companies to move because their money is set in stone. They aren't the sexy fun contractors that Congress cares about. They're the people under desks setting up computers. They have their government contracts, for better or worse, set years in advance. It just is what it is unless they whiff on a contract completely.

Problem with this take though is that pretty much all other indicators say that a market top is not in right now even if you do correct a bit more than what's been seen.

I suppose you could say that everything but tech could rally, but I doubt it. It's likely to give it a shot."

2021-05-14 11:06:52,stocks,Nice of hedge funds to make us feel good going into the weekend.
2021-05-14 11:10:45,stocks,"Outside of speculation and tech to an extent this was not really the case last week. 

Only day that the SPX was red was Tuesday last week, although it was essentially unchanged the day after.

I know I'll get hate for the next take, but it's possible that the reason that speculation has had their best days on Friday arguably (although this Tuesday was secretly nice for some there), could very well just be shorts booking profits."
2021-05-14 11:43:32,stocks,"Top up cash or broker initiate selling of your holdings to reduce leverage. You don’t need to top up the full 100k, just enough to meet the margin requirement to avoid the forced sell."
2021-05-14 11:22:42,stocks,Margin is fine if you either have the funds to cover it or keep it around 25%. The people here who get margin called are most likely over leveraging their account
2021-05-14 11:39:28,stocks,"I don’t know because I wouldn’t touch it, but I heard that there is a 5% interest rate on margin. So you can just pay interest?  Maybe?  Curious if this is the case."
2021-05-14 13:08:55,stocks,"Massive margin calls like that only happen if a single position you a heavy in either tanks hard, or (more likely) they change the margin requirements on it making it so you can no longer use margin to purchase/hold it. This immediately changes the margin balance from maybe 5-20% to (depending on your position size) up to 50-70% which will be an immediate margin call."
2021-05-14 18:17:18,stocks,I have a margin account of 60K. It's about 30% of my portfolio. When the market is red I get calls for a few hundred or up to 2K. Not fun . But these calls usually fall on a day like today . This is one of the reasons I keep calling IRS cuz they owe me 75K.
2021-05-14 11:24:44,stocks,They get margin called way before they are bankrupt and they force them to sell. They will still have money just not very much.
2021-05-14 12:02:39,stocks,"Just bought more at 170, going to be very strong post-COVID"
2021-05-14 13:44:24,stocks,"Sell now imo, people have been buying cruise stocks since it crashed last year bc people knew it would be an opening play. I’d imagine opening up would be a sell the news situation."

Cruises returning will be a classic sell the news event."
2021-05-14 13:36:11,stocks,I'd sell now. If attendance misses when they can actually sail the stocks are gonna crater. Cruise industry wasn't exactly on great footing Pre pandemic

2021-05-14 16:44:39,stocks,I'm waiting for a much lower number . Got in at 192 and nada so I sold

2021-05-14 09:41:07,stocks,Just hold it mate.  You ever seen Mickey on South Park?  That dude has a plan.
2021-05-14 09:35:27,stocks,I've sold DIS at a loss before. Do not make that mistake. Wait until parks and cruises open and watch their earnings go through the roof with all that pent up demand + disney+ sales on top of it.

2021-05-14 08:55:02,stocks,Average down. I bought in at $170 at the end of 2020 and look where we are now. The price shot up from $140 due to the announcement of the Marvel/Star Wars tv shows they are producing plus the expected user count for Disney+
2021-05-14 08:57:14,stocks,DIS is a long term hold. Give it time.

2021-05-14 11:40:09,stocks,"You pay tax on dividends. Is company buys back stock instead, you get an equal amount of unrealised gains in the form of stock price increase, which you can sell whenever you want and pay the tax whenever you want. 

Also, growth companies generally return a lot more than dividend companies even with dividends reinvested. Of course, growth companies are also, generally, a lot riskier and trade a higher valuations."
2021-05-14 11:19:22,stocks,Would you rather have them give you the profits or reinvest profits to make the company even bigger.
2021-05-14 11:18:55,stocks,Because dividend stocks never go up
2021-05-14 11:32:41,stocks,No
2021-05-14 11:40:25,stocks,I've got it on a list. Might turn into a bargain.

2021-05-14 12:31:19,stocks,Yup. All the experts are predicting further downside. Today is a dead cat bounce and is a good day to sell (build up dry powder).

2021-05-14 17:28:01,stocks,"Sure we could debate that Tesla is overvalued and you might win the debate for sure. But you need a lot more than that to cause a crash. Dot com bubble, the name says it, was caused by a lot of extremely overvalued ""dot.com"" companies that made 0 profits and no real growth potential.



Here is a few differences we have today:


* The feds are far more dovish than they were in 2000


* Interests rates are far lower than in 2000.


* Most of the SP500 companies are unstoppable growth machines. Especially when looking at fang, they are money printers. Totally different from these 2000 .com companies.



A correction is still very possible but i think a crash is very unlikely."

Sometimes is good to wait for an opportunity.
I always have the feeling that i need to buy some stuff cause i got a lot of cash waiting to be invested but everything is running so high.
Wait for pullback or find different sector.

2021-05-14 08:28:27,stocks,an index fund will have lower fees
2021-05-14 08:29:04,stocks,ETFs will give you slightly smaller returns (very slight) because of expenses but they give you better purchasing/selling ability so you could quickly buy more at the beginning of a green day if you wanted.

If you're willing to hold for 5 years, the price you bought it in at might be cheap (or who knows they might be bankrupt). Do your research on the company, their plans for the future and what they have in the pipeline.

It may keep dropping in which case you can DCA. Or you can sell and if it drops enough, buy back in.

But no matter what you do, you should do a ton of research on the company and decide if you think it's a good long-term investment because there is nothing short-term about a $BB play."
2021-05-14 13:21:06,stocks,It doesn’t seem like BB will be making much addtl revenue until 2023 at the earliest. How long did you plan to hold it for when you first bought in?

2021-05-14 10:41:34,stocks,You can set it to deposit into your cash/core account or reinvest the dividend back into the stock (at least for most stocks). The longer-term your investment window is the better dividend reinvestment (a.k.a. DRIP) is compared to taking the cash since it allows your investment to compound.

The odd time, I'll sell a share and try to buy it back at a lower price to realise some profit, but I won't ever sell more than 10% of my holding in a company with this strategy, and I aim to only do it when I think the stock is selling a bit too high in the short term."

2021-05-14 12:49:10,stocks,"Sell a small percent of your holding today, and immediately convert it to TQQQ, then either continue doing the same, or only average down into your holding is an idea. Saying that, QQQ is just coming out of somewhat of a dip, so now might be a good idea to throw in 30%, and use what's left in QQQ to average down, assuming you know the risks of holding a leveraged ETF."

2021-05-14 09:28:23,stocks,"Possibly not. Retail sales numbers were pretty bad, falling below estimates, signalling that people may not be spending as much as people originally expected, which throws most recent inflation concerns out the window when you combine it with PPI numbers."

Once these companies settle at whatever price is deemed reasonable, we will be back on track to more “normal” market.

Inflation matters! Until it doesn’t...
Bonds! Meh they’re not correlated anymore...
Dollar value! Has an almost negative correlation...

2021-05-14 14:24:30,stocks,"I sold all of mine and bought the big PLTR dip to try to recoup. Step 1 and 2 of losing all of my money, but I am tired of watching ARKK drop like a single stock with what seems to be a very low probability of spiking like a single stock is able to. I just hope to get back to break even and move it over to VTI."
2021-05-14 10:31:30,stocks,"By your logic, any green day is a pump. You're clearly a victim of confirmation bias."
2021-05-14 10:58:32,stocks,I completely agree with you. Total trap. Absolutely nothing has changed from Wednesday’s news. I expect Apple to dip to 120 or below along with the rest of the market for the next couple weeks at least. Yesterday and today are merely small gifts to make you think it’s ok to bust out the wallet.
2021-05-14 14:05:00,stocks,Sounds like a good opportunity to do some of your own and share the findings!
2021-05-14 07:31:11,stocks,More likely based off what I saw related to Tuesday that shorts are booking profits instead of this being totally organic.
2021-05-14 10:36:25,stocks,"Yeah, I have seen this take a lot on these forums but I just can’t agree. As you say, there are a lot of variables but I don’t see things at least in the short term correcting much more, especially in the Nasdaq. 

Hard to say though, and moving into the 2nd half of May we could also see weakness through Tech especially, exactly like the play book from the last 6 months.

Speaking of which actually, I think that post this correction (if it has played out like the previous two) we should see a big snap back in the index, which I think may be seen today, but could be too early to tell."
2021-05-14 13:21:38,stocks,It's a bounce - but not really that good of one. It's barely breaking even from yesterday's open.

This isn't even shorted much anymore now that this is an SPX stock, if they didn't cover before it was added, most of them all covered during its parabolic move from December 22nd to January 8th where it rocketed up 37.4%. Ironically, it being an SPX stock both protects it some at times and also makes it a heck of a lot more difficult for the games that are played here from time to time to work now (which is, and yes, I know this will get hate, trying to gamma squeeze it up)."
2021-05-14 16:30:58,stocks,I'm super bearish on TSLA mid- to long-term but I feel like betting against them on shorts with how much hype they have behind them is just dumb unless you're a short-selling legend. It's asking for trouble imo.

DIS aimed to have 100M subscribers by 2024, they achieved that in March. For some reason, this growth was not enough and analyst expectations was 110M for this Q. 

D+ has only been around for less than 1.5 year so I feel the subscriber expectations was fairly high. 

D+ has now doubled their estimates to 230-240M by 2024."
2021-05-14 10:59:34,stocks,Subscriber count was a huge miss

2021-05-14 08:43:12,stocks,It's no conspiracy. A relatively small number of big players really do dictate market direction. If they can sell for a nice profit and consequently lower the price enough to push out weak hands then why wouldn't they? It's easy money for them.
2021-05-14 08:20:24,stocks,lol right after the media's constant FUD on growth too. That they wont work in an inflationary environment. That is crazy how quick things can change. On Wednesday media made it seem like the next crash was coming let alone a correction and now it all forgotten.

2021-05-14 13:15:11,stocks,There is interest charged but if you're ratio of margin value to non-marginable value crosses a predetermined threshold then you are required to correct it by either selling something or depositing into your account. Depending on how big the overage is they can choose to liquidate some or all of a position in order to take you out of a a margin call. They have this right since it's their money that you are now overspending. This usually happens when the margin requirements on a certain stock change and it becomes no longer a stock you can use margin to hold or purchase. That instantly shifts your ratio since you previously had that on margin.
2021-05-14 16:59:39,stocks,I don’t know what a much lower number is but that may or may not come.

2021-05-14 13:27:39,stocks,"Streaming growth and international expansion with the possibility of major M&A activity somewhere along the way. The genres they're strong in (kids and sports) are relatively sticky so I think they have decent odds of keeping churn under control as they grow.

Analysts seem to think the subscriber adds from last Q are mostly free trials though. They need a major acquisition or a couple more Qs of strong subscriber growth to convince them IMO."
2021-05-14 14:15:23,stocks,"Honestly yes I am hoping for another pump, but a pump towards what I believe is their fair value, about $60. In my opinion they’re significantly undervalued in comparison to some of their competition ie. Comcast, Discovery, Fox. ViacomCBS together offer so much in terms of content via cable and especially through streaming with Paramount+ which should start to grow revenue from subscribers. Pluto.tv is also another strong way to generate revenue from advertisements along with the many strong brands ViacomCBS own including Nickelodeon(top domestic cable channel for young children), MTV, and Comedy Central. That’s not even mentioning CBS’s exclusive sports rights. Sports definitely suffered for sometime through the pandemic, but as recovery continues people will get hyped again about being able to hangout with friends and family to watch sports together. There’s so much to remain bullish about with this media company. In the short term I’m hoping it starts making strong moves up to break through the 20 DMA as there’s clearly been resistance at around $40. Even so, I can’t see Viacom falling even lower than $38 in the short term unless the market tanks further. I’m long $50 9/16 calls."

This describes much more of the tech industry than we like to admit. Most of the ""unicorns"" are barely horses."
2021-05-14 18:06:19,stocks,"Every time is different, of course. The dot-com bubble had nothing to do with the Japanese asset bubble.  And the housing bubble in '06 had nothing to do with the dot-com bubble.  And the way things look now have nothing to do with what happened in '07/'08.

I haven't studied the dot-com or Japanese bubbles enough to really know, but I have studied the '07/'08 financial crisis, and I would say it's accurate to say that right now is quite different from that.

But I think it's fair to say that you can always say ""well this time is different"".  That's always said, every single time.

What do I see that's similar, though?  I see irrational exuberance.  I see a lot of debt and margin.  I see a stock market that lives and dies by the mere words of the central bank.  I see an economy that's been crippled by Covid and somehow still thinking it's business as usual.

So, I'm skeptical, and I've got my retirement riding still but my ""funny money"" is out and waiting for a better entry point.  It will come.  It always does."
2021-05-14 17:50:15,stocks,I agree with you for the most part. I just thought it was striking comparing the old dotcom bubble giants against today's speculative kings. Some patterns are barely distinguishable aside from the timescale. The similarities are definitely there but the circumstances are different.

CSCO's PE was actually not that crazy back then, by current standards, about 142. Ok the interest rates in 2000 was more than 6%, so I don't know how much this PE will translate to in the current almost 0 interest rate scenario....

QCOM's PE seem to have been higher, about 175 according to this article

I was late to beef up my plays after the March rally and thought earnings was a great chance to make it up so I rushed and bought many of my positions earlier this month. But then earnings erased all the gains and inflation beat me down 2 more pegs for good measure. 

If I had more patience, I coulda doubled down once the inflation fears came back but I blew my gunpowder too soon being jumpy and earnings was a bust anyway. I’ll never yoink all my money out of even my conviction holds cause that’s how you totally miss out on a day like this but I also now see that keeping your cool will often reward you sooner or later."

I think as retail investors trying to time the market is generally unwise, because robots/pros will generally beat us at this game.



That being said, this is why its so important to only invest in businesses you really believe in, and to have good diversification. If in February you only invested in random hyper growth stock you don't believe in, then yea i agree you were forced to rotate some of it to reduce your risk."

Jeanine Wai -- Barclays -- Analyst

Hi, good afternoon everyone. Thanks for taking our questions. My first question probably maybe for Rob. I just want to make sure I heard your comments right in the prepared remarks.

So getting down to the mid-20 billion range on gross debt, that's where you think you need to be to hit IG status at mid-cycle prices. And I think ultimately, that's an important goal for you all. So about 10 billion more to go from there. Can you just remind us what your view of mid-cycle prices are at this point? And how does this jive with your prior target of three times leverage as the trigger for growth, which I think was also at mid-cycle prices?

Rob Peterson -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer

Yes. It's around the $50 range. And if you look at the price decks that are being used by a lot of rate agencies, they're in the high 40s right now to look to close to $50. They're not -- so they don't move their price decks with the current environment of being in the mid- to high -- low 60s.

And so that makes a significant difference on where that breakeven location is at. And so is it exactly 20 -- $10 billion? Obviously, there's a lot of different things to factor, as I indicated in my remarks, but it's somewhere in the neighborhood of that. It's somewhere -- other things will go into that. It could mitigate it to be a little higher than that would be possible or even a little lower than that.

But obviously, there's a lot of things that go into it, but it's somewhere in that range. So even though that you can probably move forward and get pretty close to that or lower that three times in your model for the second half of the year. But by the end of the year, based on -- if current oil prices were to continue, it's not that price deck that we're going to be considered for investment-grade."""

2021-05-14 00:00:00,stocks,"Deflation - how to play? Hi all!


*Current situation*: everyone appears to be convinced that we will be plagued by crazy inflation in the near future

https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/10/americans-fear-highest-inflation-in-nearly-a-decade.html

https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/may/13/top-bank-of-england-economist-warns-of-1970s-style-price-inflation

https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/13/upshot/inflation-is-here-what-now.html

*Idea*: I believe inflation will be short lived and we will revert to a deflationary environment in less than two years. Briefly, the rationale behind that is (1) stimulus checks/helicopter money programs will end, (2) the supply chain will go back to full capacity and demand will be met by offer, (3) no countries have implemented long standing relief programs, (4) demographics are going down and labor cost is going up, (5) globalization is increasing competition between companies, keeping prices down, (6) technological advancements push prices down.

You can agree or disagree with such an idea, but we are not here to assess whether I’m a moron or not.


*Question*: how do I bet on deflation? The idea I had was to take the short side of some of the inflation assets, but a short play is not sustainable for a retail investor on the long term due to daily fees. 

So, how do I play deflation?"
2021-05-14 06:28:23,stocks,"Deflation has never happened since the great depression. Even the last 20 years there wasn't really deflation. We just had prices falling in tech, and a gradual decline in quality in everything else, so you could kinda pretend there wasn't inflation because the CPI could be rigged to show 0-2%, or whatever the government wanted.

So even if you think ""deflation"" like we've seen recently you're still getting poorer, in real terms, if you're not returning around 10%/year. Bonds are still horrible value."
2021-05-14 04:17:33,stocks,"You buy bonds.

I made a promise to never touch options again. I know stocks have the potential to give me financial freedom by retirement given how young I am now. Now, I’m really debating whether should I leaves stocks entirely because I feel like I’m fucking myself over more even if I just put money into safer things rather than saving it for myself. 

I’ve lost a good amount and would hate to feel like I’m doing more damage but again the potential lures me back.

Any opinions and advice would be greatly appreciated. 

My thought process now is if I do decide to stay in the market then take a few month break, create a savings account for me THEN invest a different portion, and switch to a web-based broker so I’m less attempted to take any action through my phone during the day. And play ETFs long term only.

Other “option” is just to leave entirely.

Thoughts? Advice? How to get over losses, move forward and how to do so responsibly and intelligently?

Many thanks if you could provide any insight because it’s an embarrassing topic to talk about with people."

---Get that book.  Read it.  And read it again.
---It goes with the IBD.  They have an free app.  Use the book and the charts on the app to study.  They also have a digital subscription to the app for pay areas and a weekly newspaper.  I get the newspaper and use the app to stay on top of the stocks I like from the paper.  Probably better to get the digital..but I like the paper..old fashioned.  You can get by without paying but the paper or digital subscription will highlight stocks for you to watch and give you BUY POINTS.
---Follow the rulea in the book.  Do not deviate.
I was doing well and jumped into some really bad plays by NOT following the system.  Sounds like we are in the same boat.  Finally started seeing green again..gonna be a long slog up but very doable.  Most important thing in the book is using buyouts and cutting losses ruthlessly.
---There is a ton of online resources for IBD and on YouTube.
---I don't have my book at the moment..it's loaned out...but you can get by with studying like only 5 chapters from the book at first.
---Take a few weeks off.  Read it.  Read the 'canslim' section.  Read about the buyouts and cutting losses.  Learn the chart patterns.
---IBD has free trials also and I believe you can buy a single issue of the paper...i recommend that.
---Then when you are ready..follow the rules, get in on the buy points and be methodical.  10% a month is very doable.  Compounded that is an annual 300% return.  5% is 200%.
Don't chase a big win.  Protect your remaining capital with stop losses.  Follow the system in the book and the gains will come.  Hang in there."
2021-05-14 06:42:46,stocks,Get the IBD free app.  Go to it today and search the tickers... MS.    CAT.   NTR.

Most of their patterns are done on the weekly chart...you can click between that and the day and intraday chart.  It's real time.

I believe real estate will provide the highest, and possibly safest, returns on your capital if you’re not already wealthy (which if you’re not able to retire sounds like you’re an average joe like the rest of us). 

If you’re set on stocks then I would recommend an etf that tracks the sp500 as a safer long term investment that you consistently add to over your lifetime. Picking individual stocks can be fun, and very rewarding if done right but given you’ve played with options before this may be too close and too risky for you."
2021-05-14 00:00:00,stocks,"fundamental conflict between cyclicals and long term capital gains This rotation away from tech has me thinking.  Investors are encouraged to hold stocks for at least a year before selling on a lower rated capital gains tax.   Yet, by the nature of cyclical trends (\~6-8 months from what I am seeing), it is very difficult not to sell before the rotation.   Its also very hard to tell if you have a unicorn or not because ALL stocks seem to withdraw due to the cyclical rotation and its a crapshoot where you will end up (see 3 examples below).   That seems to be the hardest part of investing.

$CRSP:  Bought at $35 March 2021.   High was $200ish.   Fell under $100 recently

$DNMR:  Bought at $19 around October 2021 I think.   High was $63.  Now at $16.   I dumped my DNMR at $20.

$NIO:  Bought at $10.   High was 55 I think?   Now at 30 and possibly headed down to 27.

My point is that its very challenging to hold for a year bc you dont know what the cyclical rotation will do to your stock and the cyclical rotation seems to last quite a long time.   Will you still be up?   Will you be back to square one?   Will you be approaching a loss?

It seems to me that this whole cyclical rotation makes it a real challenge to hold for a year for long term capital gains.

Am I overthinking this?   Does anyone else struggle with the same issue?  Its something that I am only now beginning to understand and really need to think about.   I was very naaive thinking I could keep everything in my portfolio when everything was up 4 months ago.   I thought I curated the perfect portfolio for a 1-year hold.  Maybe I will go buy some bank stocks so they can be down in a year

2021-05-14 00:00:00,stocks,"Analyst forecasts of 109 million Disney+ forecast subscribers was a guaranteed miss, and its stupid they forecasted it For Q1 results, as of January 2, 2021, Disney stated they had 94 million subscribers.

During the annual shareholders meeting on March 9, Disney announced 100 million D+ subscribers.

Q2 ended April 3. Disney reports 103.6 million D+ subscribers. This growth of 3.6 million over a month is pretty on pace with the 3 million per month between January and March.

The average forecast from analysts was 109 million D+ subscribers. Are these analysts completely ignoring data provided directly by Disney? This estimate miss is by far the biggest narrative from Disney's earnings and is in every headline. I don’t get how they can be so off, and the market selling off in response. 

I can only assume these analysts looked at Q4 2020 to Q1 2020 (73.7 to 94 million subscribers) and based something off that. But analysts not only should know better, they do. I researched bearish analysts on Disney after their Q1 results, and they were all aware this large bump for Q1 came from Disney’s purchasing of Hotstar in India. So a growth of 20+ million per quarter, per analyst knowledge, shouldn’t have been typical. 

I’m sure the answer is that analysts and the market can be quite dumb. Wish I realized this so I could have loaded up on puts, as this was a 100% guaranteed miss on forecasts."
2021-05-13 22:08:04,stocks,"Additionally... One important note that was brought up in the call - March saw greater new subscriber numbers than what was seen in Jan or Feb. And they're still on track to reach 230-260 million subs by 2024.

Unless fed wants these plebs going bankrupt, they’ll keep printing and massaging inflation rates.

Either that or people start getting meaningful raises again, lol."
2021-05-13 22:13:05,stocks,It sounds crazy but I think a lot of these stocks are pricing in the rates being raised. I’m optimistic we won’t see this massive drop once the fed takes away the punch bowl.
2021-05-13 22:18:59,stocks,"https://etfdb.com/etf/AGG/#holdings

I see a lot of 30 year in there. Short is where the trade is."
2021-05-14 05:08:50,stocks,Inflation is a concern but the panic is overdone (and artificially pumped by the media). It won't be nearly as bad as the doomsayers preach.
2021-05-14 09:28:54,stocks,"A bond fund will drill if rates go up. Let me explain. A bond is typically issued at (or near) $1,000 face value (par). Say you buy a 30 year bond today with a 3% yield. Now say in a month yields double to 6%. The market value of the bond will have to adjust down so that the bond trades in the open market with a 6% yield. Conversely, if yields were to fall to 1%, the market value of the bond would rise so that it would trade with a 1% yield just like everything else in the fixed income market. 

People don't understand this, but that second phenomenon has been greatly at work for 10+ years. Say you bought into a long bond fund in 2006. That thing has a bunch of paper yielding 7% in it. The market value of the underlying bonds has gone up drastically because interest rates have fallen so much. So if you bought into the fund for hypothetically $10 a share, it might now be trading at $13 and you pocketed 70 cents a share for years along the way. A pretty good deal for those with low risk tolerance. 

Here's the problem. The people buying that bond fund today are buying at a big premium to par on a bunch of the assets inside the fund. When those mature, the fund only gets par back. If your bet is that rates will go up, a bond fund is seriously a terrible investment. If you feel the stock market is frothy and you want to get into fixed income, I strongly recommend individual bonds (US Treasury or agencies) or CDs. You can make a laddered portfolio where you stagger maturity dates. The longer bonds will have a higher yield, but they are subject to massive price swings if rates go up. If you hold to maturity you'll still get your $1000 face back per bond, but you might get absolutely hammered during the holding period while the bond tanks to bring its yield up to market levels and you could come out way behind in ""real"" terms if you buy it at a 3% yield and inflation is 5%."

2021-05-13 22:16:51,stocks,"They’ve been trying to raise rates after dumping them for their 2008 recovery, but we’ve gone full circle are on the edge of another collapse with no financial tools left in the locker.

Best way to reduce debt/stimulate economy right now is to devalue, and keep printing.

When this ride ends, it’ll be a big one. I’m guessing it’ll coincide with an election handover year where one party throws the next under the bus.

Even during these conditions, I’d be more confident in holding a solid/required company than timing a dip, with 25% funds in dry power or just blow margin on when we bottom out. I’d stick with essential services like data/cloud/energy/banking. Materials might be susceptible to mass layoffs during temporary cost cutting.

I think rotating to bonds would be smart if we had competent long term leadership that tried to ween the economy off the current method, but currently we have a system that works around short term promises to win elections, where no one wants to make the hard choices."

2021-05-14 00:00:00,stocks,"What did I do wrong investing in commodities during the inflation? Hey guys, I’m trying to figure out what I did wrong here. Are commodities something we shouldn’t invest in during an inflation?

FYI, I’m new to this, just started last week. When I was looking into what stocks to invest in, I kept reading news about the fear of inflation, which eventually was confirmed yesterday with the CPI report. 

But prior to this, while doing my research and reading about the fear of inflation, I looked up what kind of stocks to invest in during an inflation, and 'commodities' seemed to be a very common answer. 

So looking at companies dealing in commodities, I narrowed my list down to $CLF, $FCX, and $WY. I did see that they were trading at their all time highs at the time, so I read into their outlook, which basically said that given the rise in demand in the commodities they deal in and the bottleneck in supply, these stocks should continue their trend this year. So I got a few call options- 1xCLF 5/21 $20C, 2xCLF 5/28 $22.5C, 1xFCX 5/28 $43C, 1xWY 5/28 $39.5C- all by Monday morning. 

Well… yesterday I got destroyed, but I chalked that up to the overall market being down. Today however, was also a blood bath. Why? Like where did I go wrong? That's what I'm trying to figure out."

Energy Transfer (ticker: ET) is the people behind the Dakota Access Pipeline. Yes that's the same pipeline that the Standing Rock Sioux tribe is/was protesting because they were worried the project could contaminate their drinking water/the environment among other concerns. The tribe has an ongoing legal case against ET and is seeking to have the pipeline shut down. The U.S. District Court for D.C. ordered the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to conduct an environmental review of the project. There was a chance the the pipeline would be shutdown while the review happened and could last until 2022, but recently the USACE determined that the pipeline did not need to be shut down while the review was conducted. On top of that they had excellent Q1 earnings summarized below, and have had strong, recent insider buying. Overall the fundamentals look strong, the pipeline will probably not be shut down, and it's not too late to hop on board this rocket.

2. Shit load of insider buying in March and April. See link in #1
3. [Recent price targets](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ET) between 12 - 14 a share. Currently below 10.
4. Very [Strong Q1 Earnings](https://ir.energytransfer.com/news-releases/news-release-details/energy-transfer-reports-first-quarter-2021-results) and forward guidance

2021-05-14 08:51:22,stocks,">Make sure not to wash sale bad trades so you can get those losses to offset gains.

Just to clarify, you can always offset losses, even from wash sales. A wash sale just increases your cost basis, so you can still deduct the loss, you just have to make sure to sell again (and not rebuy within 30 days). Ultimately, this is only a really big deal if you sell in December and rebuy within 30 days in January. In that case, you can't deduct the loss for that year's taxes.

There was a guy here that did this. He had over $200k in realized gains. Lost almost all of it and sold to deduct losses, but then bought back in within 30 days in January. Despite not having any money, he still owed taxes on the $200k in gains because he couldn't deduct the loss until the next year. Ouch."

I think u got the opposite"
2021-05-14 09:13:44,stocks,"Yeah guess I shoulda elaborated. If you really want to lock in the loss, don’t buy back in for 30 days. That way when you do buy back in you’ll be able to hold that stock into the next tax year without being disallowed of the previous loss. You never loss those losses (unless the stock turns profitable on the new basis) but locking them in sooner than later is often ideal for tax loss harvesting unless you really need to buy the stock back fast."

2021-05-13 20:12:44,stocks,"Idk all of the tickers you have picked out, but on first glance I'm not overly concerned about your portfolio's long-term performance. I see people with most of their portfolio in a single growth-centric industry (i.e. TSLA, NIO) and I can only imagine how heavy the bags are getting.  
  
Will things keep getting worse over the next few months? Quite possibly, yes. If that concerns you, perhaps sell your weakest convictions and store it in a broad-market index fund to ride it out.  
  
The one thing I'd warn you is to try and not catch a falling knife and overcompensate by putting more and more into a falling stock. Be mindful of your diversification and be patient. If you haven't already, do more research on your current stocks and build confidence in a target price of yours.  
  
Good luck!

2021-05-13 21:36:11,stocks,"Same. It seems silly to me to sell at a loss, especially if it's something like AAPL or MSFT that will obviously go up eventually. I have one stock that is a total loser but I STILL hold onto it because it will probably go up on a fluke at some point. It's already a loss to me and if I don't get it all back, I don't care, but I keep it because I know I could sell it at LESS of a loss if I just wait. 

I think a lot of people selling off are people with limited funds to invest and aren't able to keep buying the dip that just keeps dipping. If they don't sell, they don't have much more to invest with and are just losing more of their investment in the short term. I'm kind of excited for a big dip so I can really start throwing more money in that I'm saving for such an occasion."

2021-05-14 01:30:48,stocks,"Yes. We are in a weird time in stock history. You have great companies meeting and beating quarterly estimates. Having billion dollar profits and then the stock price tanks. It makes no sense, especially coming out of a pandemic and doing great numbers. This is only my uneducated 2 cents. I have been heavily invested in stocks since 1991. Seen or tried every investing pattern and tried to learn all that I could during this time. The only thing I can see that is different today than future years is the giant sums of money not going in and out of markets. There are Millions of new investors with covid licking everyone down and now free or close enough to it trading apps. Take all the money in Bitcoin, that use to would be flowing in stocks. Now take all the crypto trillions and it’s now night going in the market. This has trades and volume down instead of increasing per the size of money in crypto. Now you have meme stocks where people have dug in their heels to prove a point and they aren’t selling and buying but rather holding for crazy highs on a couple stocks. Crypto or meme strokes aren’t bad but they have altered the market and taken a lot of money that would be trading into stocks and funds and put that investment elsewhere. I don’t know what happens or where we go from here but I know stocks that are getting killed should be going up if your going off their sales and figures."

2021-05-14 03:06:55,stocks,Why is everyone so jittery when we are still so close to ATHs. Looked like the kinda dump that happened when Hwang's fund was liquidated or when GME happened i.e possible margin calls. Because the market dumped violently and then bounced back hard. I'm still bullish for a bit longer I'd guess and I'm someone who sold everything at SPY 350 because it felt like we had run too far
2021-05-14 08:50:05,stocks,"I ain't selling shit.   


Its funny how when things were all green, people were thinking how easy it is just to buy the dip. But then when the dip happens, peoples reaction is ""IM SELLING ALL MY STOCKS THAT ARE DOWN AND PUTTING THEM IN MORE SAFE SPACE.""  


I mean, cool, I don't have anything against ETFs, but for me that means that the person doing that went into investing with the wrong strategy in the first place.   


I got like -20% portfolio atm (started invisting 4 months ago). And I would love to panic about it, but the fact that I will invest for next 20 years, sometimes take profit, makes me relaxed because I know 4 months are not that much of a time period to make conclusions.   


Tbh I fell more bad because of last 3 months profit in crypto (100%+),  witch is only 30% of my portfolio, and the 70% in stocks are down 20%. So It makes me think about how I could have made lots of money by throwing all in the crypto market. But the fact that you can't predict the future makes me think that its more important to have a long term diversification, rather than short term profit."

I have this theory that Wall St are punishing retail. They see the huge influx of retail in 2021, and know the average hold time is 100 days. 

Using the cover of inflation and FUD they short the fuck out of everything retail oriented (notice all the biggest hit stocks are Reddit and YouTube's favourites, including Ark?)

For who has a sensible portfolio, like you seem to, and not on margin, holding can work fine.

Stocks eventually recovering is no excuse to just obstinately hold onto a ticker you made a bad call on and don’t even like. Opportunity cost exists. Obviously you can’t be green all the time but money taken by a ticker you now hate/misjudged is money that can’t be applied somewhere else.


Frankly I’ve taken the midground of dumping picks that upon reevaluation I now realize I never knew anything about and shouldn’t have bought to start with. All the while I am building a cash reserve to give myself a buffer while also consolidating into the things I personally have the most confidence. It’s helped my portfolio stay steady all things considered and will just make me more and more confident with time.

2021-05-14 02:12:55,stocks,I’m holding. By the time I need the money it’ll be decades. 🤷‍♂️
2021-05-14 02:18:41,stocks,I’m holding. I decided for my sanity though I’m not opening my chase app until fall
2021-05-14 02:19:09,stocks,"Just buying a few bits here and there every few days. Just chipping away with any spare cash. For me, tech and clean energy aren't going anywhere and I don't believe the companies I'm invested in will either.
I have sold a few things at a loss to buy the dip on my highest conviction stocks."
2021-05-14 02:19:30,stocks,Lol dude we're u not here March of 2020 ?
2021-05-14 02:19:31,stocks,Kinda stupid human behavior to sell when it becomes cheaper.

2021-05-14 02:43:31,stocks,Your portfolio is zero diversified. You will lose..
2021-05-14 02:48:50,stocks,I have not sold
2021-05-14 02:50:48,stocks,I bought a little bit of AMD the other day and now I'm just gonna sit and wait. Won't even check my account for a while. All but one risky stock are guaranteed to be around for a very long time so I'm just going to let the market do what the market do.
2021-05-14 03:33:43,stocks,"Buying a stock just because it goes up is just as bad as selling a stock just because it goes down. If you did your DD on the stock and nothing changed with the company, why sell it? If you can not handle swings might aswell move to World ETF."
2021-05-14 03:42:56,stocks,"Yep. Took out enough for an incoming kitchen remodel, but the rest stays."
2021-05-14 03:54:22,stocks,Quality stocks like FAAMG going down after stellar earnings and guidance is a strong buy signal if you ask me.
2021-05-14 03:57:01,stocks,Meh. I'll check the market next February. Threw out my sell button a while back.
2021-05-14 03:58:42,stocks,"Yep totally following your game plan man. Averaging down my highest conviction stocks where I can and just holding and riding it out. All my investments I'm happy to hold for a couple of years if I have to, although if they reach my PTs before that then it's sell time. If you're holding for a while then most stuff is just on sale rn."
2021-05-14 04:03:07,stocks,Not much of a storm if you avoided memes and unprofitable companies.

Nothing to panic or worry about. Stocks will just bounce back up eventually."
2021-05-14 04:45:12,stocks,"I don’t need the money right now, so I’ll be holding. It’s been a bitch though, I entered the market on Feb. and made some stupid decisions. 
I have TSLA, COIN, ENPH, TDOC, NIO hurting me the most. 

I also have APPL, MSFT, DIS and some ETFs. 

For the next months while I’m not selling, I also have found it hard to buy the dip on riskier bets and think I’ll just invest in ETFs for a while."
2021-05-14 04:53:28,stocks,Ive always regretted selling more than buying.
2021-05-14 05:01:34,stocks,"Most of these stocks have barely fallen 3,4,5,6 %!! What is the hullabaloo about!??"
2021-05-14 05:06:24,stocks,"A lot of people will disagree but sometimes is good to cut loses on some stock clearly going down. Better to lose 5% on a trade than 20%.

Also there is something called opportunity cost. You can wait 10 years to recoup your losses or make money faster with better investment.

However if you have solid stocks with good fundamentals I wouldn't sell at the bottom."
2021-05-14 05:18:32,stocks,"Your holdings seem sensible. You'd be panicking more of you were in meme stocks. My gains reduced by 5% last week, so like you I'm not worried. Others are seeing their portfolios halve in value."
2021-05-14 05:38:19,stocks,"Lol Im holding. Im 30% down from February, but apart from one or two gambling choices, Im pretty confident that it will be back on track - especially in the vaccine industry, where I think the fact that there will be booster shots perpetually is not priced into the market cap of those two companies.   


Big holdings: NVAX, MRNA, AAPL, PLTR 

Btw NVAX is fabulous: [https://www.politico.com/news/2021/04/27/novavax-coronavirus-vaccine-484731](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/04/27/novavax-coronavirus-vaccine-484731)  


Their drop is basically due to shortage of 2,000-litre bags in which the vaccine cells are grown.  And guess what - this is something that will be solved soon enough, and then... sky is the limit."
2021-05-14 05:46:10,stocks,"Any particular stocks to buy for cheap? Maybe at fair value or undervalued, went down a lot?"
2021-05-14 05:58:38,stocks,I hold some of those. Can’t see myself selling within the next five years unless my shit really blows up. Ride or die.
2021-05-14 06:12:53,stocks,"

When pandemic hit in March 2020, my account was 25% down. I bought whatever I could and then stopped looking at the price action. Everything is back to normal within a couple of months. 

Just buy whatever you can and then go hide in the bunker.."
2021-05-14 06:46:22,stocks,"Honestly, I have been doing the same, just holding and, if anything buying more stocks of the few companies I remain bullish with. You should look into Shift Technologies (SFT), Awesome growth, massively undervalued, and exactly a service people are looking for when buying selling a car. BUT considering the high inflation in the used car sector (march 10%), I guess it was not that hard to beat? Bullish on Shift."
2021-05-14 06:46:42,stocks,Holding. I’m only down in my high risk portfolio which is a very small fraction of my overall portfolio. That said I am down about 40% and that does hurt but I’m still confident in most of my plays. I invested money I don’t need any time soon so I’m going to give it time to recover.
2021-05-14 06:51:07,stocks,"Don't sell unless you need the money for something else. Ever. Just buy more if the market take a dive. 

Of course, I'm not saying you cannot adjust your holdings if you feel like something has risen too much, or you lost confidence in a stock. But find something else to put it into. Never leave the market. And also, you should never sell stock just because it fell 50%. It is why it fell that can give you a reason to act."
2021-05-14 07:09:35,stocks,What is the point of telling stupid donkeys who dont know how to do research and value companies properly to just hold and dca?
2021-05-14 07:10:10,stocks,Picking up some OT to load up on my high conviction stocks and options.

2021-05-14 07:15:27,stocks,People selling out right now are learning about risk tolerance. Hopefully they keep their money and ETFs and didn't sell the bottom to go back and buy the top.
2021-05-14 07:17:15,stocks,I'm riding out the storm with you. The companies I invested in I feel confident that they will bounce back. No need to sell since I don't need the money tomorrow.
2021-05-14 07:20:36,stocks,"I might just be weird, but being active worked for me during Covid and its working for me now. Selling last year's tech as it becomes long-term for value pullbacks (e.g. the home builders and financials a couple days ago). Basically every tech>value move since February is paying off, and based on the size of the value spread still, this trend could potentially continue for awhile.

Disclosures: This is with a small % of my portfolio - most of my holdings are long term. Also, I can't statistically prove its anything but dumb luck."
2021-05-14 07:20:44,stocks,"As soon as we knew the Fed wasn't going to up the interest rates, I sold off a few positions (tech mostly) for commodities.  I still hold my blockchain positions, as the miner I invest in has a pretty large stake in Ethereum.

I'd love to get more of my money out and into the CC market, but taking an average 40% loss right now is not appealing whatsoever."
2021-05-14 07:21:04,stocks,Im holding too. Stocks always bounce. Might be awhile but Im not sweating.
2021-05-14 07:24:19,stocks,I sold everything with over 10% gains but I am holding on everything else.  I figured I can use that money to buy low.
2021-05-14 07:25:55,stocks,I am holding and buying consistently. Tends to be the only strategy that works. No one knows the market better than the market knows the market.

2021-05-14 07:50:09,stocks,"I sure hope so. We all know that making decisions based on what the market is doing in the short term is a terrible idea, but not everyone has the emotional fortitude to do what's right.

Personally I moved all my main accounts to bonds about a month ago bc everything was so expensive. I plan to hide out there for a bit. I figured something was going to happen and if it didn’t I’d just miss out on a few months of gains. I told myself I’d go back in after summer. Very scientific.

Nope. In fact, you've unlocked the secret to winning in the stock market: never sell."

There is an aspect of truth to ""you don't lose till you sell"", if your stock is simple experiencing a correction, a long term hold with something promising has a good chance of paying off. Remember, usually these companies have pretty good incentive to have a higher valued stock. 

Just hold and wait. Let noobs panic when they don't see 400% increases in a week."

Now I have some cash on hand (luckily I sold my Corona related investments just a few days before the current correction began) and can't wait to invest them.
In the crisis last year I began by investing into systematically relevant financial institutes (as a proxy for people investing based on the desire to invest in safe stocks), I think I might be building on this strategy. It's nice to have some banks still showing green when everything else is declining (for me, JPM, Citigroup, Barclays and ING Group did the trick last year). The last few days certainly won't make me panic."

2021-05-13 20:35:51,stocks,Best Buy on the OTC right now is GGII. Do your own DD but it’s about to become pink current and announce the reverse merger with Hempacco. Up 21% today but still tons of upward mobility.
2021-05-13 21:32:32,stocks,Maybe get out of tech stocks?
2021-05-13 22:29:36,stocks,What do you think those indexes are made of lol
2021-05-13 23:37:12,stocks,Why are you even posting this question if a circuit breaker hasn’t popped.
2021-05-14 01:54:27,stocks,I’m buying a small amount on the dip to add to my two penny stock holdings. I sold the rest of my penny stocks last week when they were all up. I also got rid of a few dividend stocks I held. Now I’m flush with cash for more day trading or future buying opportunities. Not to mention I already have an index fund and a 401k. I do believe we are going to see a major correction right around the beginning of the third quarter. So I guess it all comes down to market conditions and risk tolerance. Good luck.
2021-05-14 03:23:14,stocks,Sold out of nio and ark G. Bought Twitter. I have no idea what I’m doing lol
2021-05-14 03:34:26,stocks,I moved everything over to gamestop because of its negative beta.
2021-05-14 09:21:39,stocks,"i keep saying this, but Fidelity did a study years ago that showed that the best performing Fidelity accounts were accounts where the user either forgot they had an account or forgot the password. Basically, making good stock choices in terms of buying, and just holding and ignoring what happens. 

People joke (or not joke lol) about ""stocks always going up"", but in all seriousness, when we consider much longer timeframes it's almost a certainty (once again, provided you made a sound, logical choice in what you picked in the first place). So yeah, if you bought something you planned on holding for 10+ years, then if you hold it for 10+ years, you are very likely to win."
2021-05-14 07:15:31,stocks,It's so funny that they tell you not to invest with your emotion but that seems like what most of the stock market does anyhow
2021-05-14 01:17:28,stocks,I hope you’re right buddy I’m at the point where I’m not even checking my portfolio lmao. Kinda what I get for having almost only tech stocks tho
2021-05-14 05:35:31,stocks,This is the way
2021-05-14 06:52:13,stocks,"I am right there with you and that's kind of why I just contribute weekly to the few companies I remain bullish on and, usually just hold till I can sell for a profit always."
2021-05-14 07:37:43,stocks,"100% agree with this. Predicting the market short term is basically impossible, even investment professionals have very little idea about the very short term. Just hold and average down and ride the recovery back up"
2021-05-14 08:33:06,stocks,What does DCA mean

2021-05-14 12:17:12,stocks,I would also prefer to hold than sell at a loss.  So far today I’ve had a +5% turnaround.
2021-05-13 20:14:24,stocks,"I mean it depends on what they invested in and what their goals are.

We know from all the white papers looking at actively managed fund performance that very few are able to beat the S&P 500 Index over long periods of time.

2021-05-14 07:40:51,stocks,"100% this. I think this happens to most new investors. It's part of the learning experience, and paper trading doesn't brace you on how to deal with a real loss because the emotion isn't involved yet. 

I took some big losses this way - thinking I must have been wrong. I went back and did the math on my picks recently, and I would have made over $150,000 on those trades had I held. Instead I sold them at a loss. 

You just have to remind yourself that it's all part of the learning process, but sometimes those mistakes can lead to further mistakes if you lose confidence in yourself."
2021-05-14 05:03:07,stocks,Yeah. I started with small amount and slowly adding up as I gain more confidence in my trades. I may have missed on some gains but my lessons when I lost money were cheap.
2021-05-13 21:25:03,stocks,"Same here. I'm fairly confident I've been correct in the intermediate-term close to 100%...maybe 90% of the time. Every time I think if I had waited one more week I wouldn't have locked in thousands in losses.

The other side of me thinks of the opportunity cost though. I think if I had dumped quickly after the first big down day (maybe 3-4% down) I could have shifted into a winning sector for all the time I had to wait and I would have been making gains during that time. It's a fine line and quite honestly can be one hell of a tug of war. Oh well. Err on the side of caution they say."
2021-05-13 20:31:25,stocks,"Same, been adding."
2021-05-13 20:41:30,stocks,Once could say.... We like the stock

2021-05-14 14:49:24,stocks,"Same, but I sure fucked the timing.

My biggest bag atm is PBW, clean energy etf. I originally bought in last year at like 30, sold just before the election at 70, bought back in December at 90 and a few buys from there up to 120 in the end of January. Downhill like a rock since then, 75 atm, but yeah no real plans to pull it."
2021-05-14 01:17:44,stocks,I wish I was this smart
2021-05-14 02:17:13,stocks,This is the best reply. So true.
2021-05-13 23:38:29,stocks,Actually tho.
2021-05-14 03:33:35,stocks,That's actually a good point.  VTSAX is often recommended over VTI because it makes it easier to sleep at night and discourages bad behavior.

Your TDOC, ROKU, DKNG, PLTR, PINS they are not pulling back “minorly”. If you bought in february or so, you very well may be down 20-40%. 

Been trying to tell people that 20x+ price to sales is NOT okay if analysts are predicting stagnating or even FALLING qoq sales as a result of reopening. The growth is priced into to the moon, but we’re not getting out of this atmosphere in earnings."
2021-05-13 21:06:27,stocks,You’d think a 5% pullback is literally Ragnarok from the reactions.
2021-05-13 20:18:17,stocks,"If you look at correction only from ATH, it looks fine. But if you consider 1. the run the entire market had from low of March 2020 2. the fact that most of these companies reported earnings which they had to anyway (i.e. even if Covid hadn't happened), then it can be serious.

The market is blown up basically. And blown up things either fly or bust. The floor for this market is very, very low from current levels. If it does fall, corporate America has once again made a fool out of all the tax payers. They got their BIG stimi checks."

There are thousands of companies that do the exact same thing they do and all of them have workers with clearances and such.

These guys are trading at about 30x rev... and why are they negative on earnings? Its not like they are developing something new here. Their software is a high school project... so whats the deal? I assume its customer acquisition costs right? Thats the problem with defense contractors. Costs a lot of money to land contracts.

Apple is losing market share in mobile and is about to make a huge mistake with PC's though I guess thats still so small that its not a big deal. But the mobile decay is real especially overseas. Though app store rev is still great I would think that the shrinking install base will eventually come back to the app store too. So with apple its all about how they use the horde of cash.

Pretty sure people will still be drinking Coke 20 years from now though... doubt that will change in even 100 years and there really isnt a lot of space for many more competitors. They already tried and some did ok but for the most part, KO is entrenched."

2021-05-14 00:12:37,stocks,"That this all began almost exactly after the GME debacle kinda raises eyebrows, too

Even if we don't ascribe a sort of conspiracy to the powers that be that rule the market (I do think a handful of tutes and their algos exercise inordinate power over the market using things like order flows gleaned from Robinhood), the fact is that one sector got overbought. Seriously overbought. Rotation happened. 

Reasons were given, parroted endlessly by financial media: inflation, rate hike hysteria, reopening, etc. All kind of after the fact like Cramer shouting at retail.

Now another group of sectors is seriously overbought (look at $SEAS lmao). Rotation back will happen. But only when the prices have gotten cheap enough for big boys to load up. We need full capitulation in the oversold sectors, though. And then we'll see the reasons -- ""oh, it was short term price inflation due to stimulus and reopening and supply shock! inflation not a thing, and Fed reassured us about rates all along!""

It's all silly. DCA into businesses that are solid and reasonably priced (relative, I know). And hold."

2021-05-14 08:27:12,stocks,"But if something else would climb faster, it would have been better to sell, especially if you want to offset gains for taxes. Let's say you are down 30% on a certain position. If you are willing to hold for 5 years to regain that loss, that means any other position that could provide more than a 30% return in 5 years would have been a better position. Even a safe index like VTI would far exceed those returns on average.

Of course, nobody knows if something else will climb faster. I'm just saying that the optimal solution is to have your money where it will climb fastest.

In practice, you're suggestion is still good because of the uncertainty of the market. However, if there is good reason to believe it will take many years for a stock to recover, I would definitely at least consider other options."

They are prepping to hit the NASDAQ and as such will be the first true Retail Cannabis (Not just CBD or Medical) Chain to be on the nasdaq.

A lot of us were touting $1+ eoy (when it wasn't consolidated) they are definitely still on track for that. Do your own DD. Their values are solid, they have their foot in the door in the US market after purchasing FabCBD (80% bought, 3 years to purchase the other 20%) they are one of the biggest online retailers, they are supported by Aphira (now Tilray after their merger) they are opening retail locations in tourist destinations left and right (think 80+ stores right now) and they have passed most of the NASDAQ checks and plan to launch out of otc to mainstream by end of month.

If US goes full legal like everyone thinks the Biden administration will do. This thing will explode. Even if US doesn't they are fucking solid and worth at least $1 a share in my book (or $15 a share under current consolidation) Raj Grover is a fucking mastermind

2021-05-14 10:36:29,stocks,"Just look up IOS vs Android market share on your favorite search engine and find recent data. They have been shrinking for a while now. Though there is some variation, the trend line is definitely down for several years. This is not news.

As for entrenched, hard to say. Phones are not enterprise productivity devices aside from the common communication usage. Further, its not like there is a killer app on the iphone that you cant get on android or any other phone OS. You can argue consumers are entrenched in itunes in many cases so there is definitely some consumer pull with that but question is whether or not that valuable enough. I am not sure. Again its not enterprise. 

I look at it like Facebook. Is it entrenched? I dont think so. I just dont think the stuff I have in there is very valuable at all. The pics are really backups and my friends list is all over my phones anyway. The friends not on my phone arent really friends and I can lose then at any time. So is it really entrenched? I am not sure.

And then you also have to ask, even if the entrenchment lasts, can Apple keep growing and at what pace? Certainly the past 5 years have been much slower than the 5 prior. This is the problem of being consumer heavy. Enterprise, unlike consumer services, happily pays more every year for services as long as the price is less than cost of training for new software. But consumers dont have to worry about that. They dont care. So convincing them to pay more every year is a hard sell.

Still like Apple, but just saying. Its not all roses. Apple can become the next IBM and just go sideways for a long time. It will come down to how they spend that cash."

2021-05-14 00:29:22,stocks,"Sure but it's a strategy that only worked because we were riding a historic run in tech and speculation.

Here goes:

JPow, a god of money from Banklandia, turned on his money printer after the economy crashed because Covid shit in the pool. He used the money to shock the pool (the market) and even used his money printing magic to start running water hoses into the pool, making the pool so damn wet that everyone wanted to swim.

Once you were in the pool, getting wet was so easy. With a life jacket (literally any semblance of a functioning brain and basic understanding of investing) you were pretty much guaranteed not to drown and when you finally got out you were so much wetter (richer) than when you went in.

The specific strategy of buying monthly call options that were reasonably out of the money worked most of last year. There was a guy who made millions on Roku just betting with call options that it would keep going up. It did in fact keep going up.

The issue now is that growth stocks are losing steam because the pool is getting crowded, a few people are getting wrinkled fingers and everyone keeps thinking every warm patch of water they bump into is someone's piss (it probably is).

As a result, companies valued outrageous above their earnings have started seeing big pull backs. Before people were invested in their growth and potential future earnings (or fomo), whereas now people realize the pandemic pump is going to slow down at some point and it's better to start gathering your things and heading for the door before the party officially ends.

Market sentiment for growth sectors and tech is officially in prisoner dilemma/Mexican standoff territory. Everyone still wants to get in the pool, but doesn't want to get stuck mopping up the mess.

Tldr: pandemic market go brrr, still brrr but less brrrr-y and people are getting sus"
2021-05-14 10:53:18,stocks,"I guess my overall argument was how can you agree that, given where both companies are today in terms of profit, growth, and balance sheet, Coke should be trading at a higher multiple than Apple. That's my only question. And that's why I think big tech, in general, is oversold and ripe to buy. 


No one company dominates their market forever. KO has had poor returns for a while now, and if you owned their stock over the last decade, you're likely well behind the market. That's why it's hard to call any stock a forever stock. I'm sure Apple will one day cede its crown, but I can't predict the future of when it will happen."

Apple on the other hand almost went bankrupt not that long ago. If they hadnt removed Steve, they probably would have gone bankrupt the way he was burning cash.

FB is a lot younger and hasnt really been tested yet. Google tried but Google is out of favor and most people view them as the same as FB.

I know a lot about the company and have been involved 4 years or more.

I have made a car off ACB(3K) and Canopy(5K). I reinvested in ACB because of their aggressive growth philosophy. They were the #1 legal producers in the world. Demand was bottle necked in Canada for the ability to buy at the retail level. They didn't allow as many stores to sell as the government proposed. They had a lot of medical throughout the world and bought many companies with stock all along the way.

The thing is, the dilution of stock, managing these companies and direction is hard. Thanks, Terry!!

But, the infrastructure is there and yes they did have to contract because they were making a f\*ck ton of premium weed and discovered that there was the retail side that was either bottle necked or over priced due to taxation vs the local illegal weed guy.

I have about 27K in ACB. Whether good or bad. I like the stock!

2021-05-14 00:00:00,stocks,"Individual stock picking versus an index One of the easiest benchmarks to look for in a stock is to see if a stock has beat VTI/SPY on a 1 year and 5 year chart or not. If the stock hasn't done that, why would you pick an individual stock and introduce more risk to yourself? what are the chances that a stock would beat the index if it hasnt even done that in the past? of course given there are no major catalysts that would launch the earnings/revenue into the stratosphere compared to the past. 

This of course applies to stocks which have been around for a while and havent seen multiples in revenue/income growth. Slowly and gradual revenue/income increases dont matter, because the market also grows slow and steady. Then of course there are other reasons like major changes to market like increasing steel/lumber prices in the economy which benefit steel/lumber industries.

for example, Coca cola (KO) has increased 20% in the past 5 years versus VTI growing 100% - why would anyone buy it? even in a market crash in 2020, it crashed harder than VTI. 

Most people do not beat the index when it comes to stocks. What are other reasons someone would pick individual stocks?"
2021-05-14 00:00:00,stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, May 13, 2021 **PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, May 13, 2021**

The wild swings in the market continue, with three indexes bouncing back after yesterday’s selloff. With the market fluctuating so wildly, it is difficult to pinpoint the reasons behind this price action, but I think there are two main, competing factors contributing to the volatility the market has seen in the last two weeks or so. It seems that fears inflation, marked by high prints in the consumer price index yesterday, are causing concern that the Federal Reserve will tighten monetary policy sooner than expected and is pushing the market down while the April Job Report, which missed analyst estimates and marked a sharp declaration in job growth compared to March, bolsters confidence in the Fed’s claim that it will not consider tightening monetary policy until it sees a “string” of strong labor reports. Again though, with so many factors revolving around the market, it is difficult to see the clear picture.

The S&P 500 (SPY) closed the day 1.17% up after closing 2.09% down yesterday. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) closed 0.77% up after closing 2.54% down yesterday. The Dow Jones (DIA) closed 1.26% up after closing 2% down yesterday. 

Yesterday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the consumer price index (CPI), which measures a basket of goods as well as energy and housing costs, rose 4.2% from a year ago, compared to the Dow Jones estimate for a 3.6% increase. The monthly gain was 0.8%, against the expected 0.2%. Excluding the volatile food and energy prices, the core CPI (this is the main measure of inflation) increased 3% compared to the same period in 2020 and 0.9% on a monthly basis. The respective estimates were 2.3% and 0.3%. 

Today, the producer price index (PPI), which measures the average changes in prices received by domestic producers for their output, rose 6.2% compared to April 2020 and 0.6% monthly increase. The core PPI, which excludes volatile items like food and energy rose 4.6% year over year and 0.7% in April. Economists polled by FactSet were expecting a 0.3% monthly increase in April and 3.8% year over year. This is the biggest jump since 2014. In tandem with the CPI report, this shows prices for both consumers and producers has increased more than expected. 

However, while the readings in inflation definitely are not good, it is important to note that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has consistently reiterated he expects any rise in inflation to be “transitory” as the economy continues to recover from the March and bottom and want to see a “string” of strong labor reports totaling 1 million before. In an April 28 meeting Powell said, “Amid progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened. Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.”

Moreover, the April Job Report, released last Friday, showed the US economy only added 266,000 new jobs last month, missing estimates of more than 1 million jobs gained and marking a sharp deceleration from March’s total of 916,000 new jobs added. As said earlier, members of the Federal Reserve, including Powell, have consistently reiterated they want to see a   
“String” of strong labor reports before considering any changes to the current policy. Talking about the March Job report, Powell said, “We want to see a string of months like that \[like in March\] so we can really begin to show progress toward our goals. We just need to keep reminding ourselves that even though some parts of the economy are starting just great, there’s a very large group of people who are not.” The April Job Report bolsters Powell’s argument that large segments that the Federal Reserve will move slowly in changing policy. 

In addition, at a separate event in April, Powell said that quantitative easing would likely taper “well before” the interest rate is increased. He said, “We will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.” In short, while the inflationary readings are not great, I’m fairly confident fears that the Federal Reserve will tighten policy sooner than expected are overblown. Looking ahead though, I expect the kangaroo market to continue in the near term. Just my two cents.

Third was the deal with Verizon, where you could sign up for free for a year.

2021-05-14 12:05:04,stocks,">Of course, they were going to grow tremendously to start

Yeah that's why there were so many predictions of them reaching this number this soon. Disney originally predicted 60-90 by 2024. Hastings thought they'd get 20m at best in their first full year. Please let's leave hindsight out of this. Absolutely no one expected this kind of growth from the start and before you mention the pandemic again, there was no pandemic in Disney+'s first and most of the second quarter of it's launch.

>But now they are slowing, which I expected all along.

No shit genius. Have anymore shocking insights for us Einstein?

Predicting a slow down is a nothing prediction. It's not a prediction at all - It's just common sense. That's not the problem and that's not what you were saying. You're not just predicting a slow down to the mean, you're predicting a halt - the only result if Disney + really does have a limited audience. And no they won't halt immediately regardless but that hasn't actually happened yet. You're patting yourself on the back on a prediction that hasn't come to pass yet if it ever will.

They haven't even launched in every market yet. They're only in a handful of Asian countries right now with eastern europe left to go"

its because a opening a naked call is dangerous and can balloon out of control.

However, for a short put position, thats not the case.

Assuming (using TOS for example) you are approved for standard options trading and margin, you can open short puts on margin. if you get assigned, simply sell and cover the deficit with cash on hand (whether that be from your bank, left over cash and sweep vehicle funds, or from other positions etc). you will, at most owe the interest rate from your broker for 1 days worth. which will be much less than the long put you have to buy to make it a put spread.

With that, how come the long put becomes necessary? the only thing i can think of is to protect you from the possibility of the underlying dropping massively (i.e. 20%+ ) in the span of couple min."

2021-05-14 00:00:00,stocks,"SQ is trading at an absolute bargain right now I just wanna point this out for people who might be afraid to buy this stock right now. SQ is trading at a 7 PS ratio, that’s more than half of what it was on dec 22nd 2020. 

The only times it’s traded at a lower PS ratio than this post 2017 were Dec 2018, Aug 2019-Jan 2020 and March 2020 - May 2020. If you bought this stock in June 2020 or February 2020 you were buying it at an 8 PS ratio which is a higher valuation than what it is today.

Let’s compare this to PYPL. PYPL is growing at a steady 30% Y/Y and currently trading at a 12 PS ratio. SQs revenue growth Y/Y for the latest quarter is 266% and for the 2 previous ones it was over 100% for both. So SQ is growing revenue this fast yet trading at 2/3 the value of PYPL

Also in June 2020 PYPL reported 5.26 billion in revenue and had a market cap of around 180 billion, last quarter SQ reported 5.06 billion in revenue and has a market cap of 89 billion

With a valuation like this how much more will these growth stocks sell off? and why are people afraid to buy more with bargains like this

Edit: I don’t know where people’s brains are, they don’t understand how fast software as a service can grow, Bitcoin is 9% of their revenue, if they lost all that than ok a 9 PS ratio? That’s the value it was in February of 2020 and still cheaper than PYPL, even if you don’t include their crypto revenue SQ grew over 100% Y/Y and their monthly user base will continue to grow"

2021-05-14 01:58:52,stocks,"Nah I think SQ is mainly using Bitcoin to up its total user base, the more services they provide the larger reach they have, it is odd they do but they’re probably required too"
2021-05-14 01:16:51,stocks,"fintech makes us techies laugh and laugh at the fools who think its tech... next you will tell me that home depot is tech because they have an app. No opinion on SQ honestly, but its not really tech. Its finance and not even as ""tech"" as any ole bank or any other credit card processor or even credit card companies."
2021-05-13 23:29:14,stocks,Wrong...70% of the revenue from the latest quarter was bitcoin. Why don’t you show us how you calculated 7x and 9x and cite the right sources?

2021-05-14 01:59:36,stocks,It’s SAAS and software is tech
2021-05-14 02:24:47,stocks,"I guess SAAS technically isn’t tech you can just classify it as software lol, the only tech square has is their hardware which is used by so many small businesses, chick fil a uses it and every local restaurant I eat at. To your other point they’re expanding what they provide over time, as is PayPal"
2021-05-13 21:16:32,stocks,"This is the dumbest point lol, SQ is the 88th largest company in America by market cap, they aren’t just a speculative startup they’re the second largest fintech company and they’re growing faster than the largest"
2021-05-13 23:32:04,stocks,"7x is for the past year, and 9x is the past year minus the Bitcoin revenue, their Bitcoin revenue has just increased a lot for the past few quarters but so has their other revenue"

2021-05-14 01:44:07,stocks,"Nope its a platform where you have extreme users, but few, and tons of casuals who only click on one link and look at nothing else. Thus rendering advertising moot. It was just a matter of time for people to figure this out. They are trying to find ways to change that but it is what it is and is. Further, its easy to replicate. 

Its actually a wonder that Twitter is a market leader in their segment, which is basically short headline comments. With all the upstarts and kids moving over to things like snapchat and whatever that new one is with the creepy me me videos, I am surprised twitter still has significance.

Practically all CEOs are absentees between the ears... in fact, 99.9% of non-founding CEOs are worthless. They can all be replaced entirely with someone making $200k-$300k and you would get the same result if not better. Like him or not, at the very least, Dorsey created his companies. Always take the founder over a hired bean counter. Always."
2021-05-13 20:04:40,stocks,"I was saying 9% for the past year, it has a grown a lot though, tbf if you wanna use the 15 ps ratio it’s only a little more expensive than PYPL"
2021-05-13 21:58:39,stocks,I’m bad at timing the bottom with dips so I just buy more when I’m comfortable with a stocks valuation
2021-05-14 02:48:55,stocks,"Come on man... All software offers a service. Thats the whole point. Putting your software online makes you no different than any website. SAAS is just a new age marketing designed to put one over on bean counters (including many investors). It works, because bean counters think tech is some sort of growth panacea. Its a hot sector for 20 years running so everyone wants to be tech.

I know its semantics but its also important to note that when all cards are on the table, it will behave more like a bank than a tech company. The real question with SQ is how far can they push their margins? They are not the market leader but then again this is just payment processing... not exactly rocket science. It might end up being like Visa vs Mastercard. Or maybe not... I know my company doesnt use SQ. They prefer using cheaper merchants. Harder to setup initially but saves them a ton long term."
2021-05-14 02:58:32,stocks,Maybe I just dont know how valuable their segment is without major integration with massive companies. Paypal definitely has them on that end.
2021-05-14 08:03:17,stocks,I’m not saying square will go down the drain. I’m saying cherry picking Amazon as an example of stocks working out is bad....
2021-05-14 01:53:14,stocks,"Dorsey takes absentee CEO to a whole new level then because he barely speaks in their earnings calls. Also, you don't have to choose between founder and bean counter, you can choose between founder and someone with an engineering or product background that has an aptitude for the business side of things too. Like Pat Gelsinger or Satya Nadella."
2021-05-13 20:52:15,stocks,"This kind of comparable analysis is pretty dangerous. Especially if it's against a single company. 

Many would argue PayPal is pretty richly priced itself."
2021-05-14 03:21:31,stocks,"On the software side square definitely has the edge, idk how expensive their payment processing hardware is to be fair, I just know a lot of different companies that use it mostly shit like restaurants and food trucks. And yeah in the end SQ is online banking, they’re goal is to basically provide everything you can get from a bank just online, the only reason it’ll be successful is because it’s easier for people to use than traditional banking, and sometimes people will pay a lot of money for easier. The only thing they burn money on is crypto processing besides that I expect them to push their margins pretty far, how far? Idk I’m not an expert lol"
2021-05-14 09:58:44,stocks,"It doesn’t matter the example I used, my point is SQ is a long term winner, they’re expanding their customer base rapidly"
2021-05-14 02:41:45,stocks,"Na I think its fine. Not everyone has to run the business side the same way. History has shown me that stocks will always follow fundamentals. Short term swings due to CEO hype are fleeting nonsense. Better for day trader than actual investors. Frankly I could care less if a CEO spoke. I dont pay them to speak. I pay them to make good decisions. I just want the numbers, what they are doing, and any future projects. I could care less if they used a Siri app to do the presentation.

That said, its not like I am a fan of this dude. Just that he did it himself so if I had to choose between Dorsey, some other engineer who didnt create his own company, or a bean counter who also didn't create anything themselves, ill take Dorsey. Still wont buy SQ or Twitter though lol."
2021-05-14 15:13:28,stocks,"Dollar dollar bill, y’all"
2021-05-13 21:59:47,stocks,"this is true, but it’s because people see fintech as the future of banking with how much cheaper it could be to maintain as opposed to traditional banking"
2021-05-14 03:43:22,stocks,"SQ and Paypal basically charge a premium for processing due to convenience and ease of use. They are however A LOT more expensive than any wholesale processor. Literally more than double than say, Costco merchant services which is not even close to being the cheapest here in the USA. The funny part is you can get similar hardware from practically all the wholesalers today but people just dont know. 

But yea, its all about marketing and integration. Paypal obviously did that and SQ is succeeding too. We will see where they land in time. Not my cup of tea honestly. Rather just buy Costco."
2021-05-14 12:37:51,stocks,"Even with your cherry picked stock...Amazon went from a low triple digit stock, to like $6 before rebounding lol.

Saying squares a good company to buy because it has a large market cap doesn’t make sense. That’s like saying tesla is fairly valued as a good company because it has a high market cap...

Long term winner ? sure. I’ll get behind that. Doesn’t mean it’s valued appropriately in the short term...and it’s overvalued by a lot."
2021-05-13 20:17:27,stocks,"Classic survivorship bias.

Fot every Amazon that did this, there are countless high flying P/S that eventually went into obscurity."
2021-05-14 12:46:05,stocks,"It’s not overvalued near the levels of the dot com bubble, in the dot com bubble AMZN had a PS ratio of around 35 and they weren’t increasing revenue a lot at the time, SQs ps ratio is around 8 and they’re growing at an incredible rate, the rise in their stock price is mostly justified"
2021-05-13 21:18:08,stocks,"Yeah but square is building a platform with an increasing user base to prevent that, they’re increasing the services they provide and increasing their customer base, this isn’t rocket science, people like their services"
2021-05-14 14:44:11,stocks,"Wanna make a friendly bet on this? Nothing drastic or even with money, something funny . Maybe a Reddit song or something lol.

I’m betting from *todays* price, the stock will fall by 25% or more in the next year.  So if the stock were to go up to $300, and drop by 25% from the top, that wouldn’t count as a win for me. From $200, it’ll fall by 25% or more."
2021-05-14 12:05:37,stocks,"Ooh, look at this. In your “analysis” you said they made 5b last quarter. Which yes it true, that’s a forward of 20b. 95/20 is 4.75 foward and a current(made 10b last years) 9.5. Where did you get 7?"
2021-05-14 12:14:06,stocks,https://ycharts.com/companies/SQ/ps_ratio
2021-05-14 12:36:41,stocks,"That is 8 not 7. Also, this is a horrible metric. Where does it demonstrate that they made 32m out of 5BILLION in? This is surely a bargain with a P/E of 280 as of now."
2021-05-14 12:42:04,stocks,"It was 7 yesterday when I posted this kid, and think about the services they provide.. you think payment processing is going to stay at those margins?? They’re spending it on providing crypto payment processing, expanding their hardware, and various other shit. This isn’t rocket science their margins are going to improve"
2021-05-14 17:05:19,stocks,"It’s funny you call me “kid”, since you probably have not been investing before COVID. Since margins are low, revenue per capita is low, management is horrible, and there’s a lot of competition/low institutional sentiment. It isn’t the best stock out there. And you thinking this is a bargain concerns me as a investor, it could be a growth stock but definitely not a bargain. I’d recommend you letting a CFA or a CPA handle your finances since clearly you aren’t competent enough. I would be more than happy to recommend some."
2021-05-14 00:00:00,stocks,"Thoughts about SQ below 200? Good entry point? Been wanting to get in on this stock for a while. Bought some at 208 and then again at 205. I see its dipped below 200 after a long time. I see it rebouncing pretty strongly and making a nice 20 pc return in short run. Thoughts?

Am i missing something that is causing the stock to tank? Probably the fact btc is trending lower is what is putting pressure on the stock, any other issues?"
2021-05-13 22:07:36,stocks,SQ is on my list. My current strategy on entering new tech stocks is 40% off the high with 1/3 of my target allocation. Another 1/3 when it tanks because I bought it. And the final 1/3 when it stagnates at resistance for several weeks. At 40% from the high that’s $170 range.
2021-05-13 21:06:19,stocks,In my opinion it depends on your time frame. If it’s years I think it’s an excellent entry. My cost average is 210 on SQ and I’ve been buying it for about a year. I believe it is a potential 10 bagger over the next 10 years if they continue to execute.
2021-05-13 22:35:07,stocks,"Long SQ but it’s taking a beating, along with all growth and tech stocks.   Maybe open position and then dollar cost average in over the summer."

2021-05-13 21:08:53,stocks,Huh? Facebook was around before Twitter.
2021-05-14 03:53:31,stocks,Buying at 60 will be better yes. Buying 3 weeks ago at 250 makes 199 pretty nice
2021-05-14 08:05:38,stocks,"You can choose to sell now and take your loss, or (what I would do): hold on for longer time. May 2020 SQ was at 76, so SQ knows how to grow but is currently part of a big Tech sale. This will not last forever and if you can hold, that gives you the chance to get profit. Will not be fast though.."

When it goes up to the point that i break even or get close to breaking even, should i jump ship? or is it still a good investment?"
2021-05-14 04:17:34,stocks,"This is a company that has a good cash reserve, and has very promising promising products in their pipeline. Their most prominent one is CTX-001. In their investor update they had ‘a promise to making CRISPR a reality’ and the company has a very decent leadership team too.

CRSP is the only one of the gene-editing companies that I’m invested in right now. I’m currently at 2.5 shares at an average price of ~$120 and I’m planning to increase it to around 3-4 and then see how it plays out for the next couple of years.

I believe they’re planning to have the enrolment for the study completed by next year max, and I believe that they may not need a full Phase 3 study due to the rare nature of the diseases they’re treating.

A market cap of $8B is crazy undervalued to me. I can easily see this becoming valued at $80B within the next couple of years. CRSP is one of the most ahead in the game, and they seem very passionate to follow through and get it completed. I wouldn’t be surprised if it hit $1,000/share in the future."

2021-05-14 00:00:00,stocks,"Ameritrade flagged sale as a wash trade when I never bought back in I’ve done a ton of research and am at a loss, so I’m going to try here.

I bought 50 shares of a stock starting January 11 and then purchased 40 more on February 10, which was my last purchase date.  I sold 40 shares on March 8, which is the only time I ever sold. I technically lost 1,049.80, but the wash sale rule was triggered and that amount was added to my cost basis. 

I called into Ameritrade in March asking for an explanation. The customer service rep said it was a standard wash sale violation and I was confused but figured I was missing something so I took him at his word. 

After doing more research I called back in April and the rep said it was absolutely a mistake by Ameritrade and the wash sale rule should not have been triggered because I never bought back in. He said it would be fixed within 2 weeks. It had not been fixed as of today, so I called back and was told that it actually was a wash sale. The rep said he was not aware prior to looking into it that what I did could trigger the wash sale rule, but it technically was one. I asked if that meant that you can never sell at a loss within 30 days of purchasing a stock without triggering the wash sale rule, and he said yes. I told him I’d do more research and call back if I still thought Ameritrade made a mistake.

At this point I’m not sure what to do. I’m not really concerned about the money but I refuse to believe that buying and selling at a loss, without ever buying back in, is a wash sale. 1 of 3 Ameritrade reps agrees with me. The other says this is the first time he’s ever heard of this rule. Does anyone have any insight on what I’m missing? Any advice is much appreciated."

I am OK to hold until then, but I don't think there will be any significant up in that time frame...I will actually be happy if it doesn't go even lower.

 The rest, like EXPI, OPEN, CRSR, etc., (and I have a lot of other small plays that I have not posted above) I admit I bought them impulsively after reading some stupid seekingA or MF article that said something like ""EXPI is the amazon of real estate companies""... so probably maybe those are the ones I should exit, and consider the loss as a hard earned lesson not to be so reckless with my money again."

It's certainly not bad financial advice to suggest that you know why you get into a trade and evaluate whether that reason is still in play. Don't you think?"
2021-05-14 08:39:31,stocks,Tell the truth. You read some YOLO posts and jumped in. You didn't so DD and now you got hurt. Tell the truth.
2021-05-13 21:18:38,stocks,"If they were bad investments, why did you buy them? The fact that their stock prices have dropped doesn't mean anything has changed about the company."
2021-05-13 22:44:46,stocks,"look, you probably have some breathing room for a little bit, it's not uncertainty of inflation, the reason it tanked was because inflation crystallized, it wasn't just 'rumors' any more, 4% ""officially"" 8% ""realistically,"" certain products like cars, chicken, up double digits.

the fear is that the fed will step in and crank interest rates, which is expected to hammer tech / high p-e stocks. for now, jpow has heavily implied that they won't do that until full-ish employment is reached, which will probably not be until after stimmy expires, which I think is september.

so you have time. I would SERIOUSLY consider shifting some of your holdings out of technology and into boomers. I would go through your stuff, and just take the top 20-30% with the highest price-to-earning ratios and switch them into unexciting stuff with p/e closer to 20 or so. think mega-pharma, defense giants, railroads, construction, power companies, banks, reits, dividenders (some would suggest bonds, I don't know your situation, but I wouldn't). You have time to do this in an orderly fashion over a week or two, and your stuff will probably get a bump over the next days or even weeks after this red day, but your risk level is, in my opinion, quite high and could use some more boring picks.

If you're in a position to lose 100k in a few months, you can probably make a not-too-shabby dividend portfolio that will pay out a reasonable wage and still have growth potential, I would consider this."

2021-05-14 05:57:50,stocks,"That is also what I am thinking. I am not trying to exit all at a loss. I was just trying to see which ones are not worth holding for a long time. Even companies like CISCO, which are greatly profitable companies, have yet to recover from the dot com bubble. So what are the chances that a company like EXPI will recover from this, considering it s still like 450% up from a year ago."
2021-05-14 09:25:35,stocks,"Okay, but my point still stands: why did you invest in these companies in the first place?

If you had good reasons for buying the stocks in the first place, the only important question now is whether those reasons still hold.  But if you're not sure why you invested initially, now you're stuck because you don't have anything to fall back on.  It's an expensive lesson to learn about investing.  I learned that lesson myself at great cost."
2021-05-14 00:00:00,stocks,"Inflation fears Hello, it has been some time now that almost everywhere in the news and on Reddit most stocks are going down due to inflation fears.
I'm quite new to the sector so I haven't managed to cover all the topics, however I still have a couple of questions. 
When they talk of inflations fears, is there a datevor an event during the year where finally the data regarding the inflation is revealed? It has been for at least a couple months now that this is believed to be one of the main reason for the bloodbath

Thank you all 🙂"
2021-05-14 00:00:00,stocks,"Darn I've been doing it all wrong! So I think I figured something out.  VTI is the average stock market return which is ""hard to beat"".

I have a few ideas of stocks and or indexes that may beat VTI, but I shouldn't need 20 or 30 stocks to produce that ""alpha"" right?

I mean like people have been saying.  Are they right that a good percentage of my portfolio should be a strong base in VTI or VOO?  And then above that I can make my ""bets"" on stocks I think will outperform, but they need only be maybe 10 to 20 positions?

This way I'd have less stress instead of constantly looking for stock ideas and not risk more than a certain percentage of my portfolio?

But to me there's no point in adding stock picks that don't beat VTI even as some type of ""stability"" in my portfolio.  For example JNJ.  I see no reason now in owning it versus just VTI, for me at least.

Something like UNH or HD in my research are good picks to actually produce some alpha beyond VTI.  As are maybe MSFT AAPL etc.  Maybe NVDA too.

So I this a good approach?  Make VTI a larger percentage of my portfolio, and then make fewer "" bets"" around that to try and ""beat the market""?"
2021-05-14 08:56:41,stocks,"Yeah thanks.  After thinking about it last night, in not so sure I'll do that much better.  I am slowly upping my Total Market percentage though.  I also have a managed value mutual fund and medical devices fund that has averaged 19% for last 10 years.  They re both by Fidelity.

I still like doing the individual picks though also.  I find it kind of fun even if certain ones go down a little or appreciate slower, etc."
2021-05-14 14:46:21,stocks,Oh yeah! I definitely get you. There's a little bit of a rush putting a portfolio together and watching it.
2021-05-14 00:00:00,stocks,"Just sold everything and went index fund... I just sold all my tech/meme stocks and just went straight to index funds. Over the past few months of ""investing"" I realized volatility is not my friend. Maybe that is the wrong approach but I figured, I'll take the loss as a tax credit and just keep everything in VTI/SCHG and some dividend stocks.

Edit: thanks for the support

An example I’ll use is PLTR.
On March 8th it was at 22$. Analysts were saying buy buy buy. Great. So as of today, it is down 20% from March 8th. Vs VTI, March 8th it was 200, closed at 211 today so you’d be up 6%. Of course, you can wait 5 more years, and maybe PLTR will get to 40-45 again... that is if they don’t have competition, no issues with their business model... whole VTI may go up 30-35% but with less stress of worrying about an individual company... yes less risk, less reward...

Edit:
There have been some messages about ""paper hands"" etc, buy high sell low... valid points perhaps, but, 
I did this for my own self, as I realized that:
 1. I am not a person who can handle the volatility of some of these stocks, I am sure that they will go up in 1,2,3, years etc, but if they do, so will VTI / VOO / SPY.... maybe not to the same level but the road will be less bumpy
 2. This is a way to build a base of my portfolio. I will go back to stocks, but to at a much lower exposure. I do think that inflation will be an issue over the next few years and I think some of the tech stocks will be up / down for the next bit. Especially those companies that are trading at 100x their earnings, so I am sure I will have the opportunity to re-enter (again my opinion). 

In the meantime, I sold, yes I took a loss, but this will be used against any gains I did make this year my offset my taxes a bit (not sure how much, will see in Jan)."

2021-05-13 20:23:54,stocks,"I'm liking CLF. I've flipped it a few times and made a few thousand bucks in day trades. Small potatoes for many of you, but not a bad way to make a buck. It's one of the only stocks that hasn't bit me in the ass. It goes down, I buy, and then it goes up, I sell. I keep a few shares on the long, but it seems like the only slot machine I have found that reliably pays out. But I am definitely a newbie, so please don't take this as sage financial advice. It's just my experience with one stock. I've been burned many times on other stocks and did OK on a few as well, but I am still in the black because of CLF."

2021-05-13 20:30:27,stocks,I'm up 40% on the year because of volatility. You have to really know how to read an option chain to make any trades these days. Stocks or contracts.
2021-05-13 20:31:27,stocks,"Volatility is your friend when you want spikes. 

If you can’t stomach it, you made the right move.

Best of luck on your new positions. :)"

2021-05-13 20:39:03,stocks,stocks = lottery.  If you want a sure thing go with bonds.  If you want to gamble and don’t mind losing it all buy stocks.

2021-05-13 20:48:06,stocks,SFY is a great FREE etf. It’s been gaining since the covid crash.
2021-05-13 20:52:18,stocks,"this is just a really bad 2 weeks for tech stocks really.  lots of ups and downs.  etfs are nice and all, but a good stock can out perform a broad etf.    Take heart to the wise words of Warren Buffet. 

“The stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient”


I make my own rush decisions as well, and often it bites me in the ass, but I have also made long term bets that I was convinced were solid and they have paid off."
2021-05-13 20:57:09,stocks,Nice job. Broad market and pillar sector ETFs will always come back
2021-05-13 21:00:51,stocks,If its money that stresses you out when you see a 20% pullback then equities might be kinda not your style. Just looking at historical prices will tell you pullbacks are more common than we assume them to be. Never too late to do a risk profiling.
2021-05-13 21:10:22,stocks,"If you want memefolio exposure or just a degenerate gambler, go with auntie Cathie over at ARK. That is until she goes all ""ARKegos"" and you can realize them losses"
2021-05-13 21:12:29,stocks,r/bogleheads welcome you
2021-05-13 21:18:18,stocks,Took some hard lumps to learn this.
2021-05-13 21:21:43,stocks,Guess what's about the happen to the indexes.
2021-05-13 21:22:59,stocks,"All the crazy prices you saw like SQ bring 280...thats probably a couple years worth of gains pulled forward. With the interest rates the way they are, in CAPM theory, it benefits growth stocks tremendously. That's because of the way beta is calculated and levered/delevered. Even the slightest showing of interest rates increasing affects growth stocks tremendously...particularly ones with valuations not matching their business. Add in the fact that ETFs have ballooned (biggest worry is cathie wood ARK funds and possible hardcore redemptions), causing these VIOLENT rotations that we have never seen before."
2021-05-13 21:25:54,stocks,Index funds are for the money you don’t want to lose. You should always have a percentage of funds that you take risk with. The risk is where their is opportunity.
2021-05-13 21:32:29,stocks,"I've thought about doing the same thing. I don't think I'm going to beat the market on individual stocks. With ETFs even if I'm right about the industry being the future, it's impossible to say when it will take off, and if only a few companies in the ETF really takeoff I won't profit much. 

That said, I think investing in individual stocks and ETFs is just fun and encourages me to invest more than if I was just investing in index funds. It's cool to own a share of Tesla or Apple or something. I also don't invest significantly in meme stocks. I'll do a $100 here or there knowing I'll probably lose, but I'm not willing to gamble everything on GameStop or AMC or something, lol."
2021-05-13 21:34:40,stocks,Vti and schd. Hold and dca for life. Why find the needle in a haystack if you can buy the whole haystack. Bogleheads know this as a fact
2021-05-13 21:41:56,stocks,PLTR ain’t for the faint of heart. I’ll be on a pacemaker after this POS.

Youre doing it wrong"
2021-05-13 21:49:07,stocks,"I’m going to be shifting to a more ETF strategy but not fully. I’m not selling at loss but once the market picks up, I will sell most of my individual stocks aside from MSFT, AAPL, JNJ, V, and BX and then invest in the likes of VTI, SCHD, QQQJ, VNQ, and VFH.

I don’t have any meme stocks, but I can’t keep up with the volatility of the likes of TSLA and SQ."
2021-05-13 21:53:45,stocks,"I feel your frustration but I also would like to say, being a retail ""investor "" isn't being a day trader and I think a lot of the RI's get this confused. It took me 3 years from the point I bought 1244 shares of CRIS in 2017 at .79 to make some real valid profits. Right now we have a lot of RI's that think stocks go from 0 to 100 overnight all the time. They don't. The GME thing was an insane day that happens once in a blue moon if not ever again. Those of us that bought in almost had a coronary. Trust me, I had no idea what a close heart attack was then the day I put $10000 dollars in margin  in GME and it went to 5, 4, 12, 25 and cashed out at 10300 somehow. It was that fast. Every second was thousands going up and down. Investing means keep it there and let it grow. It's like cookies in the oven. Bake them enough but not too little and not too much."
2021-05-13 21:58:10,stocks,"Out of curiosity, why SCHG, and not some mid cap ETF? A lot of the top holdings of VTI are similar to SCHG."
2021-05-13 22:02:26,stocks,"Yikes, first rule about meme stocks is to buy stock in a company you actually want to buy things from."
2021-05-13 22:02:57,stocks,"I think you’re looking extremely short term. That’s sort of cherry picking, I mean look at pltrs run, how many times has an index doubled in a month. You have to look at the whole picture. It’s still up nice since it listed, 20% is just a good days move for that type of stock. 

And why you’re listening to analyst alone, idk. They’re time frame could be different as well, if it’s 35 in 6 months, that 22 is a buy buy buy. It’s not as if the stock itself is taking a hit, it’s tech wide. Hitting 45 might take 5 years, that could realistically be 5 weeks. It’s just two different ballparks of growth, it’s like decaf coffee and crack.

I mean I get the idea of wanting to be safer, but I don’t think the reasoning behind that is on point. Listening to someone else, they’ll never have your interest at heart first. Anything you’re being told is because they want you to react after they’re already set. Doing your own research will give you more conviction. 

Plus, buying the market is for better or worst. It’s taking in a lot of crap, it’s ignoring all metrics of value outside of the market caps. Don’t get me wrong, I’ve grabbed more too the past couple months to smooth things out and hold more that aren’t correlated. But as a whole, it’s sort of over valued and carries a lot of dead weight. 

I don’t personally get the mindset that goes into a lot of index investing. People say to don’t rely on past performance, but than grab the index’s because of the past performance. Than to diversify and don’t bias anything as you’re risking not getting what the market gives, but than hold various index’s at assorted weights. There’s worry of all these risk, yet it’s buy in, now and sooner than later."
2021-05-13 22:03:52,stocks,Try not to relapse ;)
2021-05-13 22:04:48,stocks,"it doesn't take a big brain to be in the market it takes a big stomach and some people just don't have the stomach for the volatility. It doesn't make their strategy any better or worse just that every investor has their own preference. For example I've become so desensitized to my portfolio that I literally gain or lose 20k a day and it doesn't affect me anymore. Then again, I started small and worked my way up, so I kind of adapted with the price swings over time."
2021-05-13 22:06:22,stocks,"Of all days to dump g/me, now you do it??"
2021-05-13 22:07:12,stocks,"I bought nvidia when it was $43 a share back in 2015 in a retirement acct and it will stay there for next 20 years, did same with apple at an average cost per share of $29, accounting for splits. I would definitely hang on to some individual stocks for sure. Check out Joseph Hogue on YouTube and his core-satellite strategy."
2021-05-13 22:07:52,stocks,Warren buffet definitely approves.
2021-05-13 22:10:57,stocks,"Weird I did something similar. I was doing options and learning so much but not getting anywhere. Decided to just speculatively buy shares in companies I believe in. Life’s way better now

Not as safe as index funds but it’s not my primary investment."
2021-05-13 22:17:06,stocks,"In my 401k, I have s&p 500, 400 and 600 index funds and DWS equally spread at 24% each.  The small remainder is in a Vanguard bond fund. DWS isn't doing well now (mostly tech stuff).  Overall, I am slightly ahead of just s&p 500.

My personal market account and IRA are both more for playing around and no, I am not beating S&P 500.   I am close but no cigar."

You are extremely special, I don't even know which sub to fit you in if you legitimately solely take their advice before making a move."
2021-05-13 22:27:12,stocks,"This is the way. The only twist I might suggest is VTI + RSP vs VTI + VOO. But that’s a personal preference, really. 

I find equal-weight to be much more resistant to downward pressure and much more inclusive of the upswing parts of the 500 for cyclical exposure."

2021-05-13 22:36:21,stocks,"I would’ve kept some of the “meme” stocks, GME and AMC mostly. It was too early to exit in these, however, moving the majority of your investment portfolio into index funds is a safer bet. I also have put 40-50% into these already and plan on more after the MOASS"

I hold ETFs as well, but I’m buying this shit up."

2021-05-13 22:44:48,stocks,"That's the thing about investing... Profits are never guaranteed. Even investing in VTI is not a guarantee that you'll make money. Sure, it typically has gone up over time, but it's certainly possible that a long period of decline may be just around the corner. Nothing about the stock market is certain, ever."
2021-05-13 22:45:13,stocks,"The S&P 500 began in 1926 and has [averaged](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/042415/what-average-annual-return-sp-500.asp) 7% annual return through it's lifespan. That's through the great depression, world war 2, housing crisis, everything. Sure it has good and bad years, but an average of 7% is pretty nuts.

If you had $2 million invested in the S&P 500 and get 7% interest a year that's $140k a year without ever touching the principal. You could live on the interest alone until you die, and still leave your children the $2 million base.

Assuming you can live off of $140k a year that is. I think I could."

2021-05-14 00:09:24,stocks,"Once upon a time, tech was looking expensive and investors were buying industrial, material, metals, etc. Now that tech has been sold off, it's getting cheaper than other sectors. 

Everyday I have to see portfolio flying up/down 4/5%. My hands have been badly itching to click that damn sell button but I think my love for tech is more than money. And then it's been my repeated experience, whenever I lost patience after many days of holding myself and sold off, the very next day, sold stocks starts moving up. Waiting for tech to go more down, as I think panic is in the air now, and load more.

Some of the companies being swept up in the high multiples compression are very very good and will recover once people stop ignoring the money that big tech is printing from earning reports. Its not all about money though and you have to weigh the toll on your emotions when doing risk assessment. Good luck

You have to ask yourself, how many (privileged, connected, in the know) people know the information before you, and how many people are there left to jump in after you to extend the run? 

My general rule of thumb is if you feel like you are missing out (fomo) it's probably too late."

2021-05-13 21:04:21,stocks,"sometimes. my personal best ""win"" is with AMD.  I have been an enthusiast for years, and had followed their price action for a long time as well without buying.  knowing they were slipping i held back.  but when ryzen was on the horizon and the price finally dipped under $2, i went in with everything i could.  which sadly wasnt much.  but ive held it since.  through the pandemic where it lost 20% in a week, (i should have bought more) up to the high in the mid 90s in dec, and even now where its sitting mid 70s.  im still convinced it will go over a hundred at some point.  Most analysts even still say its a buy more so in the mid to low 70s.  


My point though is that if you find that one company that you trust and believe in, that you can understand what they are doing, that makes you exited, then maybe others will be excited as well, and that could cause the price to rise.  That said, this is better for stocks that are going to move, and keep you engaged in it.  a few % a year wont do that, and finding a stock that does what AMD did is hard as hell. For ETFs though, you just find the ones you want, buy, and then its best if you forget about them for 5-10 years then look at them and evaluate if you should change something.  


I also like to tell people if they dont have one already, get a roth IRA, put whatever (up to 6k) in it, and then invest from in there.  a good way start that long term savings an etf is good for."

But movement pays for the options. It's much, much harder to sell premium when volatility is low and the market does nothing but grind up. I'm glad VIX is finally above 20 again.

>So basically getting $75 by risking $350 and that's considered ideal. But if just one spread goes against you and you get that $350 loss, it wipes out almost 5 winning trades.

That's true, but also keep in mind you *don't* have to be directionally correct in order to profit. Collecting 1/3 of the width as you said here means you're hanging around 30 delta, so you're some distance OTM. You can be directionally wrong - the stock moves against you - and still profit. The higher probability of profit is why the payoff is lower. If you want 1 to 1 reward-to-risk, then you'll have probability of profit close to 50%.

If you're unhappy with sticking with max loss, you can always exit at some predetermined loss, such as loss equaling premium received. This brings you back to the 1-to-3 profit-to-loss ratio to get the expected return back in your favour. Also keep in mind that when exiting at 50% profit, you're no longer looking at probability of profit at expiration (about 70% for 30 short delta) - you're looking at probability of *touch*, which is closer to something like 85%."

As opposed to making $800 + the difference between the entry and the price. If you do something that turns $800 into $300, what would you call that? 

>Not sure where you’re getting the $500 loss thing. 

From the fact that selling the call resulted in you having $9,500 instead of $10,000. I intentionally didn't tell you what your starting account value was because it doesn't matter.

>It’s impossible to lose money on out of the money covered call unless the stock drops and you choose to sell it at a loss.

That's because you're comparing the wrong numbers. Like most people who make this claim that CCs can't backfire, you fail to compare the correct two numbers - your profit if you do sell the call and your profit if you don't.

The question before us is whether or not selling an OTM call is a good idea. So you need to compare the profit from selling it to the profit from not selling it. You shouldn't have any reference to the starting value, as that's the same in each scenario. It doesn't change in either choice.

You claimed: 
>the contracts cant really go against you on the call side.

But they can result in you having less money than if you didn't sell that contract. If a contract results in you having less money, it's hard for me to see how that's not going against you."

Netflix was always a worry ever since 10+ streaming services poppped up.

Intel is getting picked up from all sides. Then again did it really came out of nowhere ? People who knew a lot about Intel been waiting for this for years.

On other hand Microsoft is trying to acquire everything that is trending and are making better decisions overall.

Apple just made its best laptop ever which is just scary godly in benchmarks with its chip, had marvelous past earnings.

Amazon is building pharmacy, possibly building supermarkets, absolutely marvelous earnings and will do just about anything to get to the world dominance.

AMD and Nvidia are both trying to acquire some serious companies, overall they are on streak themselves.

That is just realy shortly said, but i just dislike the ''hindsight, hindsight, hindsight you can't predict anything at all, my ears are closed wheeee''

But when i ask do these people actually went through past few earnings reports i get absolute silence, but i guess reddit doesn't want to do any homework, just wants to stick to stupid quotes and then invest at the top and cry for months.

A lot of speculations can be made, and by what i have seen, whatever after homework you believe in FAANG and similar companies now, i can speculate that after those 5 - 10 years some of these stocks will lift up the entire peoples portfolio, like they did before. Or like check the 5 years ago posts on what people think will be great after 5 years, many portfolio there beats the entire market assuming they held.

But yeah tell me how we will never know anything ever about anything that could really perform in future. Its like people here don't even want to try."

Second of all, the valuation is still insane. Tesla is not exactly a leader in the solar space, and if you actually have gone through the process of getting a solar roof from them, it’s pretty bad. Super slow. Certain parts are outsourced to solar companies that actually know what they’re doing. Like, say, one of the biggest solar companies in the world, First Solar. Which has a market cap of 7.4 billion. The reality is Teslas massive run was largely a result of a succession of short squeezes as it was clearly massively overvalued but a ton of teslas investors were retail and loved Elon, loved the hype, and loved what is yes an awesome car company. So they held long and strong and exercised all their ITM calls and held them too. Even if they don’t make any money and need bullshit like bitcoin and regulatory credits to stay up."

2021-05-13 23:02:26,stocks,"Nobody is arguing that selling covered calls has lower potential gains. It’s not a complex concept - selling covered calls is a strategy with less risk. The downside is the same as owning stock outright, and the risk is however much that might drop minus the amount you collect in premiums. Missing out on gains doesn’t mean losses, what an idiotic stance. 

What you’re really implying is that buying Spy is losing money because you could be buying Tsla, which had higher outcomes. But Tsla very obviously has higher risk. Holding spy is not losing money unless you sell below your cost basis, just like any security. 

Selling covered calls is also not losing money, unless you sell below your cost basis, just like any security. 

You may very well get better gains by simply holding the security, or in any other asset. But losing opportunity cost is not a real loss, jeez you sound like an Econ 101 genius."

You can't look at a capped earning potential as a ""loss."" We don't measure opportunity cost when looking at rates of return on investment. Owning the stock and selling a covered call is a strategy that earns a premium for holding the stock (reduced risk of loss) in exchange for lower upside if the stock goes past the strike.  It's a different strategy, a lower delta strategy, than simply owning 100 shares.

When a stock is trading sideways (or growing slightly), selling the covered call will outperform simply owning 100 shares. And if there's a downturn, you outperform as well because of the premium captured.  

If you didn't sell the call and the stock traded sideways for a month, would you say the holder of 100 shares ""lost money"" because they didn't sell a call?

Of course not.  But that's the ridiculous argument you're making."

I personally think, that if from China to the US everybody is on board with changing the energy production to renewables and the strong development of the sector despite the pandemic in 2020, it should be very likely, that we see at least a strong decade for renewable energy stocks.

While researching what stocks are best positioned to profit from Governments trying to make a switch in energy production and at the same time are relatively stable during inflation and rising interest rates, I came to the conclusion, that I wanted to invest in companies that are already profitable an so well financed, that they are able to pay out dividends.

While the US market is relatively small for such companies, countries that are more advanced in their energy production do have some stocks that fit. Europe, Canada and China are clearly ahead in renewables and I would love to get some inspiration on where to look for more companies like this.Also I would be very interested in feedback on the stocks I have come up with doing my own DD. Those are:

Encavis (Germany)

Xinjiang Goldwind (China)

Northland Power (Canada)

TransAlta Renewables (Canada)

ENPH is better for the next 5 years. But if they dont take their head out of their asses and find a better solution for their battery system then over time, they will lose to SEDG. But battery systems arent a big thing yet. They will be in 5-10 years as prices drop.

The ENPH battery system is garbage right now. It sits behind the inverters which means it must be inverted again for storage and then inverted yet again to be usable.... Total trash. What they need to do is put a switch on their micros so that they are pass through (like optimizers) when sending to battery and inverting only when sending to panel. Or if thats too hard, just offer a optimizer system like SEDG... SEDG already works that way and TESLA has designed their system with a central inverter too for that very same reason.

But ENPH is still much better for non-battery installs and will remain market leader until batteries become mainstream. I am hoping that by then, heads will be removed from respective asses."

Sadly SMA once had a micro but they discontinued it. Then they bought TIGO (or just partial buyout?), which is an optimizer. Good move actually because those are better with batteries.

Solar cells are very easy to make. They are literally printed then pressed. Thats the problem. Yes there are ways to make them more efficiency by changing the layouts, materials, etc but generally speaking, they are no more difficult to make than an heat sublimation t-shirt and its all automated. You can buy production machines to make cells readily and they arent very expensive (relatively speaking, for a business).

The other stuff is also not particularly hard to do. Running wires, laminating, framing, securing the glass, etc. Its tedious work, but not really hard from an engineering perspective and most can be done by hand. Though you can also buy manufacturing equipment for that too which you should unless labor is dirt cheap. There is no software to manage nor complex electronics. It has a low barrier of entry. This is why margins are thin.

The hard part of solar panels is actually the logistical costs (transport + storage), and legal side (certs and warranty management)."

F - Because they have a big stake in Rivian. Also, odds are they win the eV truck race long term. Rivian will likely win the urban buyers but F will probably win the business buyers. Its down about 20% from its peak.

Wouldnt say its super cheap but compared to other trash out there... and oh yea, its actually really tech unlike most of the new pretenders calling themselves such.

ENPH - Again, not saying its cheap, but it is off about 50% and they are profitable and the market leader in their segment. They will remain the market leader for another 5 years (minimum) but then all bets are off unless they change a few fundamental things with their new micros+battery tech.

I do have between 10-20k in individual companies right now, and they won’t be held for year until January 2022. I do have some great companies at decent DCA (MSFT, AAPL to name some), so my question is is how should I go about transitioning into ETF’s?

Thought there might be some other stuff I could learn that might help in this specific situation but apparently not."
2021-05-13 22:03:14,stocks,I actually make decent money and am perfectly fine getting assigned SPY. Was only over-leveraged by $37k and after moving some money around got it down to $12k. I'm going to call my broker and get some automatic stop losses set up(it's tricky with puts on TOS). My ROI won't be as high after this but losing a couple $hundred isn't a big deal. Like a half week of profits. It's higher risk but higher profits. I just was wondering if there's some more options that I could take.
2021-05-13 22:12:41,stocks,Yeah that was my conclusion as well. I'm gonna sit on it until the deadline and then take the loss and sell $12k worth of SPY. Good thing it's only a 1.7% loss currently and bouncing back.

2021-05-14 00:00:00,stocks,"Another wash sale rule post... when I didn't sell for a loss? Sorry, another wash sale rule post. 

Over a roughly 2 week period, I bought shares of a stock between $18.85 and $23.50. A week later, I sold all shares (16 in total) for $23.63. 

A few days later, I bought 4 shares of the same stock at $20.60, but Fidelity noted wash sale and put my cost basis as $23.43. I was thinking that maybe part of my sell order filled below $23.50, but I always use limit orders on both buys and sells. 

So, a few questions. Isn't wash sale only applicable on sales for a net loss? Are wash sale-rules bound by volume (ie if I buy more than 16 shares now, will I still have my cost basis be around my previous sell point?), does something seem off here or am I an idiot?"
2021-05-14 00:00:00,stocks,"$DGX Undervalued and now even has a Short Squeeze play I've been posting ongoing analysis for $DGX (Quest Diagnostics) for the past 3 months. Not allowed to link, so see post history for additional **non** short interest related deep dives. Although the returns have already been excellent during this time, I stumbled across some additional data over the past 48hrs that make $DGX Quest Diagnostics even more enticing. Astonishingly, short interest has TRIPLED recently. No, this isn't your 50%+ short **obvious** short squeeze play, but hear me out. This short interest is a suicide play that's flying under the radar.

* $DGX is a relatively low volume stock. Hence this tripling of short interest has resulted in a Days to Cover ratio of 8.6. For perspective, Days to Cover is below 1 for both G.M.E and A.M.C.
* 8.6 Days to Cover is ABSURDLY high for a safe blue chip stock with elite financials and tons of cash on hand. Again, for even more perspective, close competitor $LH Labcorp sits at 1.9.
* Now here's the icing on the cake. The cherry on top. The tug after the massage:
   * **93% of $DGX float is owned by institutions**. After recent buybacks, their float presently sits at 130m shares, 121m of which is owned by institutions.
      * Vanguard is the largest holder. Blackrock recently increased their large stake as well. Safe dividend stock = low churn from institutions. They hold.
   * $DGX recently approved $1.5 billion ASR (accelerated share repurchase), meaning they are GUARANTEED to repurchase nearly 10% of float by Q4: roughly 10 to 11 MILLION shares.

**Napkin crayon math:** Present float of 130m LESS low churn institutional holdings = ""Retail"" is playing with 10m shares. The ASR alone requires the repurchasing of 10 million shares. Now add in that short interest recently spiked to 11 million shares.

**Result (TL;DR):** Assuming institutions continue to mostly hold this safe dividend, blue chip stock with incredibly strong financials and a mountain of cash on hand, the $1.5 billion accelerated share repurchase alone would propel this stock upwards. Throw the massive short interest spike on top and $DGX can run. This is honestly one of the dumbest short positions I've ever come across in the market. It is a suicide mission with high risk, minimal reward ($130 is rock bottom floor for this stock based on their financial position alone). It's so irrational that when I first saw it 2 days ago, I assumed it was a typo. It's also too large to simply be a hedge. **See previous DDs for non short interest related analysis.**

Interested to hear your thoughts.

2021-05-14 00:00:00,stocks,"Looking for reasons why I *should not* go hog wild buying tech right now This is my reasoning below. Would like to hear some counterarguments before I begin to go on a shopping spree; I’m sure many users here know way more about this than me and can provide some great food for thought. Thanks in advance. 

Basically, a lot of growth stocks have been pummeled mainly due to A) sector rotation into reopening plays and B) fears of inflation. The first has no tangible impact on a company’s fundamentals. The inflation hysteria does makes sense, as a lot of growth stocks tend to reinvest excess cash flow and that makes them more vulnerable to interest rate movements. 

But with many of these growth stocks currently being decimated by levels of 50% or more, you have to wonder how much of that is priced in, and should inflation normalize over the coming months, these stocks should see a pretty massive jump in positive sentiment. I’m pretty confident that inflation fears are a nothingburger, making this an excellent entry point for someone like me who has withheld a lot of gunpowder on the sidelines waiting for an opportunity to invest during a tech correction. If inflation does turn out to be a more long-term issue then, again, the stocks are already down 40-50 percent. Don’t see how much more they can reasonably fall. The reward seems to outweight the risk."
2021-05-13 20:43:44,stocks,Hahaha ill never forget buying my first dip. Feels like yesterday. Turns out it was 10% and would then proceed to drop another 40%. Buy a small smorgasbord. Then buy a bit more. Then buy PLTR.

 What was one of the first ""safe"" activities that was OK'd (in my state anyway) was golf for obvious reasons, A lot of those youngsters and other previous non-golfers are now hooked. Golf was way up due to the Tiger hype 20 years ago. It  cratered in the last 6 or 7 years. Covid brought it back, and Callaway is the best play in my opinion."
2021-05-14 15:30:09,stocks,"Maybe, but when?  Theoretically they could pass a law tomorrow making it illegal to sell gasoline,  but those politicians would quickly be replaced by ones that would repeal that law before they even stopped to find their desk.

There are a lot of changes that need to be done before that's realistic and those changes don't happen quickly. 

Even when (if?) that happens,  don't forget about planes, trains,  trucks and ships. 

Even more importantly,  I saw an interesting picture of the flat globe map, where it had the four sections laid out with a circle around the India/China area and it said that 2/3 of the world's population lives in that circle.   They don't have enough electricity to provide the minimum basics for the population (cooking over fire level poor).  They aren't going to be content staying that way and they certainly aren't going to ban the internal combination engine.   They will get richer the same way we did, by burning hydrocarbons.   It would be perfect if we moved away from oil and stopped competing with them on price while they bought more and more getting wealthy.  I don't expect them to stop buying oil until long after I die of old age."
2021-05-14 15:46:04,stocks,"I agree that oil and gas are here to stay. I was just merely pointing out that energy companies who fail to adapt and continue to rely on gas pumps for a big chunk of revenue are fighting an uphill battle. Dont get me wrong i will always have a gas car even if it meant daily driving an ev for work. But i cant be in denial about the push for less emitting cars. 

As for China, they would literally ban gas cars in a heartbeat if their scientists concluded that it’s necessary for the survival of the country. I believe China will come to global dominance in terms of green energy within the next 30 years. Even now they are doing a good job relatively and they are just getting started.

Resolution copper mine just had permission removed to re-evaluate.   Rhyolite Ridge lithium mine isn't going to happen because it might hurt the unusual buckwheat.  If I was conspiracy minded I'd think XOM ran the government and I'd buy a lot more shares!"
2021-05-14 16:42:23,stocks,"Nothing is gonna stop EV adoption. It's exponential share of new cars sold. Last 10 years are only a preview of the next 10. 

It's cheaper for the end user to use electricity for transportation. And the sources have become cheap they can beat coal, gas, oil. And that's now. The other sources are technology based. They will only get cheaper and more efficient. 

$$$$$ can get anything done (see COVID vaccines in less than a year). And we're talking trillions of private investment and government investment pouring into EV/renewables."
2021-05-14 17:05:17,stocks,"I understand the sentiment,  but really,  money unfortunately can't buy faster government approval (unfortunatly bribery is still illegal), nor can it buy faster court schedules.  The lawyers are getting rich and the price of copper and lithium is growing exponentially.   To get BEVs to 50% market share needs 3X the current electrical generation capacity and 6X the amount of lithium mined.  If it takes 10 years to get an offshore wind turbine to get approval to begin thinking about construction and >10 years and counting to get permission to start construction of a copper mine (the one without the special buckwheat) then that exponential rise in EV sales will flatline rapidly."

2021-05-13 23:41:45,stocks,"It still has room to fall in my opinion. Beginning of 2020 it was literally a $4 stock. 

More concerning to me, however, is its market cap is currently pegged at around $51B, which is still more than Ford's (and essentially equal to Honda's) current market cap. 

I would do some research into how many cars Nio is actually producing per quarter and compare that to the rest of the major auto players. Sure, there may be more room for Nio to grow, but you're already paying a premium for that *potential* future growth and then some. 

It's too risky of an investment for my taste."
2021-05-14 03:48:47,stocks,Fuck the CCP
2021-05-13 22:49:53,stocks,"Do you have strong convictions in those stocks and your time horizon is 3+ years?

Hold, it's unlikely in my opinion that Nio is going to remain under 40 dollars in 2024. PLTR is questionable.

I'm in a similar boat as you. the thought part about Jan-Feb is that what seemed like a solid run up is starting to appear more and more like a pump and dump on all growth stocks - i.e. a brief anomaly (spike) that was catalyzed by a unique combination of factors - low interest rates, new retail investors flooding the market, etc.

This though is a little terrifying, as it means that we should ignore the brief spike and consider the price pre-run up and post crash as the basis for the moving average ""baseline"", which means if a market wide correction occurs these stocks will fall potentially another \~30%.

Ergo, baseline Nio valuation would be \~28, PLTR \~15 (based on the first one/two support levels pre-run up in October).

That means if a market correction occurs these could fall to their next support levels of \~21 (Nio) and \~11 (PLTR). This would be about a 80% drop for PLTR from ATH and about 70% for Nio.

This puts Nio about halfway between the market value of nissan and ford, which I'd say is a more comfortable valuation and PLTR at around a similar market cap to Linkedn (which is honestly laughable given their future potential).

but, if you truly believe in these stocks it would be a perfect time to DCA down to reduce your cost basis. Times like these are where money is made. lots of money.

If you have truly believe in the company, have performed your research, and align with their future projection and missions AND understand their subject matter, I would stick to your guns.

I work with massive amounts of data at a F500 health company, and part of our biggest problem is data analysis and insights. PLTR is directly within my ""competence"" and I've seen the need for something like this 5 years ago.  IF they accomplish their mission, it's going to be huge. And what they are trying to accomplish is incredibly, incredibly complex. I have my doubts still.

Here's an analogy: wouldn't it be nice to feed an ""engine"" a massive amount of clinical literature and have it spit out insights on patient outcomes in seconds? rather than having clinical researchers read through hundreds of thousands of articles, compile the data, perform the analysis. Think of google search but for clinical outcomes.

now extrapolate that to any massive complex dataset(s). and think about how many companies DON'T utilize massive datasets. that's right. you can't really think of any can't you."

2021-05-13 20:55:18,stocks,I lost $2k in AMD - bought right after their earnings. Sold at $79. Glad I did.
2021-05-13 21:20:38,stocks,"I think bing and google do the same thing.
In 2009-2010 I used Yahoo for PPC advertising.  Had a 25% conversion ratio.  It was awesome. Then, Bing bought Yahoo.  Overnight the same ad went to maybe 2%.  Hasn’t ever worked since."
2021-05-13 23:57:04,stocks,"Another thing to consider with Nio...

What do you think will happen with the shares outstanding with Nio over the next 2-3 years? I have a strong suspicion that they'll issue more shares to fund their growth, as this is not unusual for a newer business and they have done this in the past (quite significantly as well).

If this assumption holds true, not only is their current market cap speculative on future growth, but you're going to be heavily diluted even if they match/exceed expectations as planned.

Shares outstanding is so important and yet hardly anybody thinks about it when investing in early tech companies.

Edit: [https://ycharts.com/companies/NIO/shares\_outstanding](https://ycharts.com/companies/NIO/shares_outstanding)

Added a link just so you have an idea on the scale in which they've been diluting shareholders. Obviously if they issue some kind of stock buyback program this would be nullified or reduced. But I haven't heard of this happening any time soon."

2021-05-13 21:02:22,stocks,"I had expected them to take back off after the XLNX merger was approved by shareholders, but I'm content waiting longer for them to start hitting my sell prices. 

Both are companies I bought awhile ago, so mentally I'm distinguishing between new investments (almost all decently green) and those as my old ones with a lot of accumulated green (and more verdant futures IMO)."
2021-05-13 22:47:18,stocks,"Ummmm, what in particular about their fantastic, blow-out earnings report didn't you like?"
2021-05-14 00:44:50,stocks,that's nothing. I lost $9000 in BABA because they fucked up earnings.

With the money I had in it, I put it on KMB instead, CCL is making big moves like I predicted as well, but I really rather have 0.5% over 8 days than 4% in a day."

2021-05-14 02:21:22,stocks,The real Tesla killer is when Toyota Camry / Corolla become EVs.
2021-05-14 05:43:42,stocks,Toyota is the one of the last auto to jump on EV. I wouldn’t be surprised if they don’t go full EV until after 2030. Being such a giant and old company they have time to sit on the bench and see how this plays out before heavily investing into EV
2021-05-14 01:47:22,stocks,"What they have considered and you have not is the plug in hybrid. The vast majority of Americans now are unsure of BEVs but many of them are willing to go hybrid.

Plug in Hybrid will probably still outsell BEVs in 2030."
2021-05-14 02:17:13,stocks,"Toyota is the leading car manufacturer globally. They sell 9.5M vehicles globally, so to say 8M will be electrified is a huge move.

Teslas goals of outselling Toyota is kind of outrageous. I like it, but it's outrageous. 

Elon always aims high. That's why he never meets time lines. He wants things done yesterday, and you can't get things done yesterday with reasonable goals. You have to have outrageous goals to keep a fire under the team. Toyota has reasonable expectations.

Toyota is in to rush to transition because they don't have to. Prior will buy whatever they are selling.

Tesla needs to ramp up fast to stay ahead of the technology, and to catch up to the volume."
2021-05-14 05:35:04,stocks,"Well, seems like Tesla doesn't need to worry about that for at least another 10 years... :')"
2021-05-14 01:34:59,stocks,The energy grid can't handle everyone switching to EV right now. That would be too much power draw for the grid.
2021-05-14 01:33:44,stocks,"His point is that our energy grid can't handle the load.

Obviously our gasoline system CAN handle the current load."
2021-05-13 23:06:11,stocks,"If it takes 40 minutes to charge then how does the trip only take 30 minutes longer than in a ICE vehicle which doesn't have to stop at all? And what about freezing cold temperatures where the range and charge time of the batteries are greatly affected?

I'm not saying that EVs are not getting better by the year or that they aren't the future. I'm saying that they are still many years away from being the majority of vehicles on the road."
2021-05-13 23:44:31,stocks,"If you want to make a 400mi trip without going to the bathroom you can shave 10 minutes off that time lol. 

Freezing temps have never been an issue for me but EVs are more efficient in stop and go/slow driving so maybe it's a toss up. Probably don't need to light coals under them to start and you can get your car to the temp you want by scheduling a departure on your phone while the car is plugged in to the grid. 

I agree they're being adopted slowly. Tesla is the only company with a decent way to get around, and I wouldnt buy any other EV at the moment.  Plug in hybrid is a great option for most."
2021-05-14 01:45:26,stocks,"Absolutely not. Unless you know something everyone else doesn’t, this is a shitty emotional gamble. Do yourself a favour and buy some of the on sale names which have a real chance. I read your comments and it seems like you’ve made money so far and are looking to double down. Don’t. Load up on apple shares or spy and thank me later"
2021-05-14 02:18:59,stocks,"I will take your advice on not getting SQQQ then.

I’m actually NOT emotional at all by the way I just asked this question for feedback.

So far I learned that it decays.

My thought process had been just buy some and hold it so if everything else I have tanks something else in my portfolio would go up.

The only reason I’ve made money so far is because I’m putting a ton of research into my decisions and this was just step one of batting an idea around in my head.

I don’t know facts which is what I was hoping to gain.

My thought process is one of explorations. I’ll look in 100 directions, most of them stupid, until I find something that turns out to not be stupid."
2021-05-14 02:24:15,stocks,"You’re looking for positive beta stocks. There’s not many but you can find some which will profit from a downturn. This should fill the SQQQ purpose you’re after.

SQQQ is basically a mechanism for gambling or insider trading IMO."
2021-05-14 02:30:48,stocks,That actually makes a lot of sense thanks for the reply :)
2021-05-14 01:21:35,stocks,"Have a mix of growth and value. When markets at ATH, take profits on growth and go heavy in value. Swing back into growth when things are oversold. 

I wouldn't consider it timing the market because the money is always in the market."
2021-05-13 20:09:19,stocks,"It’s income typical from higher earners. Think about it. Those who make 200k a year make 4K a week, a statistically speaking the wealthy live frugally and have less children so forget expenses. Every pay check is another buying opportunity."
2021-05-13 21:38:38,stocks,I door dash on the side and use it as investment money. 🤷‍♂️
2021-05-13 23:10:49,stocks,"We don’t find the money but simply rebalance. Putting money in other asset class allows you to reallocate those funds to buy the dip. 

Since bond and cash aren’t correlated so when market falls like 10 or 20%, bonds and cash stays steady."
2021-05-13 23:37:48,stocks,Sell some on the way up and you’ll have cash to buy on the way down. Set an amount you wanna sell everyday the market is up big. Then on big down days put it back in. You don’t need to “ Time the market “ but when it feels like your making piles of cash take some off the table and wait. Market has 2-3 decent size pullbacks every year so there will ALWAYS be an opportunity to put it back in. Not heavy cash and don’t close your positions just take some off the top when it feels overextended
2021-05-14 07:18:58,stocks,"invest part of your portfolio in value stocks, that have low P/E and stuff like dividends, and in times of dips, sell part of those stocks, which don't drop much, and buy the dips. When the market rises, start selling part of your gains, and buy value stocks again.Basically like ""buy the dip"" strategies, also have ""sell the rise"" strategies. You don't have to eliminate your position when the market rises of course, just get some cash, for the dips.

Or just invest in value and growth and wait for years, ignoring dips. Or an ETF."
2021-05-14 09:55:09,stocks,I’ve found at least for myself that it is best to let 30% of your money sit in cash. This also heavily depends on whether you’re fine with holding short or in rare circumstance even creating a wash sale. Here lately it has been really tough. Normally I would let a stock dip at least 3 or 4 percent before I’d buy the equivalent percentage and wait until it goes back up to sell and make the 30% whole again. But lately it’s been so bad I went through my 30% in cash and it was still dropping. So I waited until the intraday was high and oversold my position even taking out some of my original position. I didn’t completely exit but pretty damn close. Then I’ve sat and watched all week. It went down and down so I bought back in very slowly. I’m still sitting on 40 % cash but I’ve been able to lower my average considerably. I’ll keep buying only on red days now. Even as stocks climb overall there will still be red days.

2021-05-13 21:48:51,stocks,"You keep a significant portion of your investment funds NOT invested so that they're available when a dip happens or the market crashes. That's how. If you end up with too much invested, just figure out where to pull out"
2021-05-13 21:55:31,stocks,Pay 200-400 a month to strictly savings for stocks. Transfer to broker and sit in cash. I dont actually make choices until I'm sure. But then also sometimes yolo a couple hundred.
2021-05-13 22:31:59,stocks,"I work, I have a savings account and I sell other stocks, hold some for taxes and then use the rest to invest."
2021-05-13 23:11:38,stocks,I get paid every two weeks?
2021-05-13 23:19:52,stocks,"I try to keep a flexible portfolio with a lot of dividends. Never use DRIP. Accumulate the cash.

To stay flexible I try to keep a 50% yearly cash basis. Basically imagine you only have half what you do in the portfolio and just work with that. If you see an opportunity then jump in. Obviously, the basis has to be reset every now and then if you have gains. Problems happen when speculative turn into long term. This is a good problem but hard to re-balance.

For divs I hold a lot of REIT. All healthcare right now but I will diversify to residential after they drop some time this year or early next. Once the eviction moratorium ends we will have several quarters of bad cash flows and they should all dip. Aside from REITs I also have KO, PEP, GIS, PFE, JNJ, LMT. 

The only tech I hold is MSFT, AMZN, QCOM, ENPH. The newer tech stuff is not very good and mind you I am a 20 year IT vet who also taught CS for several years so I know full well what they all do and I still have no faith in them or think they are insanely overvalued. But a lot of newer stuff is marred by shady nonsense. Too many bean counter CEO's who dont know their head from their ass heading companies they cant possibly understand just because its the cool thing to do right now. Everyone says they are tech even when they are more like applied tech rather than tech themselves. Its like saying Nike is a tech company because they use a 3rd printer to make a shoelace tie..."
2021-05-13 23:27:25,stocks,"Today is a good dip for Tesla. When you feel it’s lower than the price it should be, I feel it will go back to 700 easily and maybe 900 by end of year"

2021-05-13 23:52:01,stocks,A lot of people have jobs that pay them decent money
2021-05-13 23:56:24,stocks,"I personally keep around 5-10% of my portfolio in cash specifically for dips like these. I buy them then either rebuild the money I used through my job, or sell the bought stock for short term gains after it goes up 5-10%."
2021-05-14 00:24:36,stocks,I have a paid up mortgage. If there are massive crashes then I just get cash from that. Works quite well for me.
2021-05-14 00:49:43,stocks,"You are trying two different strategies, DCA takes the approach of you cant time the market, and waiting to buy dips and sell peaks is the opposite of that, gambling that you can successfully time the market."
2021-05-14 00:58:02,stocks,"I prefer number 3 with a small spattering of number 2, but here’s some common strategies people use to ensure you can always buy the dip:

1. Save your money and don’t invest it right away, building up a cash position you use solely for buying opportunities In the market

2. Invest your discretionary cash in blue chips, etfs, or bonds so you’re not just sitting in a bunch of cash for no reason. When the market dips, use them as a piggy bank, sell them, with the proceeds going to doubling down on your highest conviction plays.

3. Margin. It’s dangerous but if you are a responsible adult it’s not that hard to stay out of trouble, just don’t be an idiot with it because it will destroy you. If you can’t trust yourself to do that then better not to use margin at all.

4. Hedges. You can constantly Maintain hedged positions using options or inverse etfs or whatever can provide an inverse and levered return against your main account. For example if you’re heavily invested in the S&P, you can buy way out the money cheap puts, or vix calls, or gold calls, or TLT calls etc.. so if something catastrophic happens in the market that will tank your big S&P position, these others will rise enough in value that you have a sudden influx of cash to go shopping with. The trouble is finding cheap enough ways of doing this that it doesn’t bleed your profits on a long term bull run. That’s why I like TLT or UUP options, they’re really cheap and will only pay off in an absolute catastrophe"
2021-05-14 03:46:44,stocks,"Morning all

I usually keep cash a side for dips days 

Not much but enough, if there are no dips it just increases the cash holding

Then I buy like yesterday BABA, C3i,PLTR,INRG, MMND,CCXI

I buy in £25 slots only 

I am in my late 50's earning a min wage working as a carer

I only spend on my shares so that i have a bit in later years

2021-05-13 20:47:09,stocks,That is something I have learned over the past year.  I used to never keep much in cash in my account  often under 100 bucks and being unable to get a couple transfers to clear quick enough cost me far more than keeping a couple grand in cash in my account for opportunities that may arise.  I have already pretty much considered any cash I have into it as gambled on stocks also so I’m not relying on being able to get it back for bills and such.  That being said everyone has their own risk tolerance levels and budgets so in the end you have to do what your comfortable with.

2021-05-13 20:39:06,stocks,I'm terrified of inflation since I have so much cash so I bought $25k in VTIP on 5/11 for $52.22.  It has gone up a little plus 1.3% dividends.  Better than my high yield savings account.

2021-05-13 23:07:54,stocks,So supply and demand isn't a factor? Forgive my ignorance but if everyone had more money all the sudden say handed to them for nothing then everyone can buy more stuff witch intern depletes supply of stuff  and companies need more stuff to make more stuff cause now they all have more demand and since there is only so much stuff it all cost more to make more stuff  and now consumers need to paid more to pay more for the stuff that costs more. A thousand bucks isn't worth as much if everyone has a thousand bucks rite?

I feel like most of the info you are getting is stocks they or their company has already bought and the news just ups the price of their stock. I do take the name and look at the stock I look at the trends and if I like it and it has been going up lately I will wait awhile and see if it comes down to where I like it.  I happen to be watching a show on CNBC when one of the guest started talking of a stock, he stopped talking and said I'm sorry I can't talk about it today we are still buying it, I will talk about it tomorrow. All the other guest started laughing but you know it is usually the case they are not going to promote a stock till they are where they want to be in that stock."

2021-05-13 21:03:13,stocks,"Not to be a dick, but 2008 had nothing to do with hedge funds, it was a result of ""best intentions"" by the Clinton Administration wanting to bring home ownership to everyone, even those who couldn't afford it. 

Effective in January 1993, the 1992 housing bill required Fannie and Freddie to make 30% of their mortgage purchases affordable-housing loans. The quota was raised to 40% in 1996, 42% in 1997, and in 2000 the Department of Housing and Urban Development ordered the quota raised to 50%. The Bush administration continued to raise the affordable-housing goals. Freddie and Fannie dutifully met those goals each and every year until the subprime crisis erupted in 2008."

2021-05-14 10:35:34,stocks,"Well that's because the banking institutions then bought those shitty mortgages packaged up in financial instruments. So there was an additional risk management issue there, but the underlying securities were mortgages that never should have been given in the first place. The government mandated that they be given so financial institutions packaged the junk up and sold them off to try and make the most of the shitty situation."
2021-05-14 17:17:53,stocks,"The common denominator remains: institutions overleveraging.  Doesn't matter if it was MBSs or something else; they were not mandated to overleverage.  Hell, they didn't even bother hedging."

I’m not a financial advisor obviously, but the whole reason you bought long calls was because you thought the stock would exceed the price it was at / the strike you bought within the duration of your contract. 

Don’t bitch on Reddit, hold it.

If you need the money, liquidate, costly lesson.

Otherwise hold."

Whether or not it’s a better life strategy is a separate conversation. It obviously is *for me*, but that’s subjective to my filters (read as: the things which bring me the most joy), and I appreciate that different people may find happiness in their own ways.

As for “normal things”... “normal” is a big bucket. I like spending time with my wife, working out, hiking, etc. These are all normal (common) interests. 

It’s not my place to judge anyone. We all have wonderful and crappy things about us. I don’t think I’m any kind of exception to that rule.

Same with the other way around.  If you want to buy a call option, it's a LOT more affordable to buy one call option."

The companies figures first  seemed erroneous compared to FCX(which has gone 400% last 12M), but seems like SCCO is a company making a lot of money, high dividend and in a favorable cyclical market, so thinking this might be a good long.

2021-05-14 07:03:58,stocks,"Confused...

I tried to buy Global-E (GLBE) yesterday. It IPOd the day before. I believe this IPO went overlooked.

My broker said I can't invest in complex instruments until I fill out a form acknowledging the risk. Then I can buy this stock.

But I am thinking....what risk? It is just a stock, right?

Am I required to cover the position with margin?

Is it that after I buy I won't be able to sell due to a lock up or something? I mean it is already being traded on the market.

Any insights, please?

2021-05-14 07:30:40,stocks,"If you can educate yourself to command AI you can figure out finance and how they interact.

I'm an IT guy familiar with Linux. I'm also a high ranked security guy in my organization. My focus is to discover events and report statistics for security events. So, I have a staff of developers that automate the gather and report part.

In my mind AI can maybe find a home in two areas within finance. The first is as a stock picker. The second is high frequency trading. Maybe there are others.

In either case I imagine an AI would need an environment consisting of historical stock prices, real time prices, key stats,   balance sheets and info on management teams. You probably have the resources to begin gathering the data you probably need.

Some sort of management team ranking system for management teams and sector and market sentiment might be tried.

I wonder how hard it would be to predict the success of a SPAC based on this environment?

Given my own pain, I wonder if an AI can help me with fundamental analysis. Kind of like the ""Quant"" ratings in Seeking Alpha. Seeking Alpha seems to have automated some of that. I wonder how.

I imagine high frequency trading requires very fast access to the action and that costs money. You would need an employer/backer to do this in real life but historical data might mitigate costs during development and could also be used to attract a backer. 

I imagine that the current systems are rules based. Do these calculations really fast and look for patterns. they then take action based on the patterns.

And that would be the plan. Creating an AI that could notice a new pattern, or an improvement of an pattern recognition or maybe a improvement on what actions to take. An actual result, even with test data, and with limited results could be used to find a backer or an employer. 

It is a huge advantage to never respond to a job opening.  Try to show your value and let others figure out what job you should be given. That means put effort to manage your contacts. Almost all my jobs have not been an advertised position.Or, more precisely, I almost never have had to cold call an employer based on a job advertisement.

Your are your business, even if you have a traditional job. Advertise your plan and your accomplishments."
2021-05-14 18:09:40,stocks,Incorrect. The dividend stopped after an activist investor requested they suspend it and invest in streaming. Massive streaming effort went forward slightly after that. Emotional investing? More like actually understanding what's going on with a company before owning it.

2021-05-14 10:20:16,stocks,"Question about ETF creation/redemption mechanisms in general.  
  
**My understanding is that ETF's (let's use ARKK as an example) can choose certain stocks they hold to put in a redemption basket, so when outflows come, they can sell those stocks. And conversely, they can choose which stocks are in the creation basket, so when inflows come, they can buy those stocks. Is that right?**  
  
I'm still learning about ETF structure so it's possible I'm mistaken.  
  
If I'm wrong, presumably that means that when extra capital comes in via redemptions it gets distributed proportionally based on current allocation.  
  
Can someone help me understand how this process works?"
