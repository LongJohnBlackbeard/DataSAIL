2021-06-01 19:51:51,stocks,Your bank will suddenly have a lot more interest in you you and you will likely see more targeted advertising from them. Funny how they see more funds in your account and you’re suddenly a more valuable client!

Taxes well ask your accountant.
But I’m not a financial advisor so what do I know????"

2021-06-01 18:08:36,stocks,Sell at loss reinvest elsewhere make double the $ u know it’s right thing to do ur in to high with T
2021-06-01 17:48:34,stocks,Start selling covered calls on them and use the premium to dollar cost average down or use it to open other positions
2021-06-01 19:23:52,stocks,"I sold my T. I don’t like their management team and was just in it for the dividend and small growth. I sold for a small gain, but didn’t trust their management to do the right thing so I’m out. My money is better used elsewhere."
2021-06-01 18:30:54,stocks,"T seems like it a bond, keeps at a consistent price range and fails to deliver growth.

Keep the stock and collect dividends until you find a better stock to buy."
2021-06-01 18:37:16,stocks,"T’s management is pretty incompetent 

I do agree with you that the Hbo/discovery deal is promising but i’m not sure if it’s enough to justify holding"
2021-06-01 19:07:51,stocks,"Personally I am holding mine, I want to see what the new company looks like and get the rest of the dividends before the cut. After I am not sure, I am hopeful that the reduced debt leads to better growth. Time will tell."
2021-06-01 18:19:03,stocks,Now might be a time to start buying T at the dip. Cutting dividend might be a very healthy thing and lead towards price growth in a longer term.
2021-06-01 19:02:06,stocks,"> Reasons for selling: -T is the only stock I’ve been consistently down money on

That's not a good reason to sell. A good reason would be that you need the dividend or something has changed and you no longer like the company. 

It sounds like you like the direction the company is going in and you also don't need the dividend. Now might be a good time for you to buy more T since it is trading at a discount. 

Don't worry about sitting on a loss as long as your reasoning for holding the stock does not change. Just sit back and collect the smaller dividend. While dividend investors rotate out of the position."
2021-06-01 18:59:24,stocks,If it was me I would sell all of your shares of AT&T take the loss. The only thing AT&T had going for was the dividend they promised they would not touch the dividend and if a dividend was safe and they lied and they cut the dividend and they're going to be a shell of a company now so I would move on. Now what I would do with the money from selling your shares of AT&T is split it between Nio and Sofi
2021-06-01 18:10:50,stocks,"It’s hard to argue against that honestly. I guess it’s sentimental attachment, or maybe I just really don’t want to admit I was wrong buying lol"
2021-06-01 17:51:30,stocks,My issue with selling covered calls is it seems kind of empty at this stage. I have about &1800 in losses which I can use to offset the taxes on my other gains. If I make a few hundred dollars selling T calls all I’ve really done is sold my shares and reduced my tax benefit by the amount of gains I made selling calls. So unless I can make more than $2k it doesn’t seem worth the effort
2021-06-01 19:26:22,stocks,Thank you. I’m seeing a lot more people who did or would have sold. I really do think the company direction has shifted a lot and I like the moves they’re making. But it’s a long journey and I don’t know if I have the confidence or patience
2021-06-01 18:32:11,stocks,"I think my next buy is qqqj, so if I sold T that’s what I would put most of it in"
2021-06-01 18:39:32,stocks,It seems like management has been super incompetent historically and relied on the power of the dividend to hold the stock price firm. But if they are willing to compromise the dividend to me that’s a huge sign of an attitude and culture shift and maybe a return towards healthy growth
2021-06-01 19:10:01,stocks,Nice to see a perspective in favor of holding. Most of the comments are going the other way
2021-06-01 18:20:54,stocks,"I totally agree. The reality is I don’t have extra money I’m comfortable throwing at T, but the idea behind holding is that with the dividend reinvestment I’d pick up ~30 shares a year at these prices which is pretty nice, especially if it takes a few years for the company to really get its footing back"
2021-06-01 17:55:26,stocks,"True, just looking at $T it doesn’t look like they will move back up to $33 anytime soon.  I would just sell at a lost to offset the gains you made this year."
2021-06-01 19:58:43,stocks,You very well may be right; the company may start heading in the right direction. I sold because I see it dipping more before climbing. I will review T again for a possible investment if it drops below $28.20.
2021-06-01 18:35:30,stocks,"Best thing I did over the last year is sell some of my stocks at a loss and invest the money in other stocks.

In short, never get attached to a stock"
2021-06-01 17:58:02,stocks,"Thank you I appreciate that. I kinda feel the same. Logically I’m leaning towards selling it, but for some reason I actually do really like the direction they are going in and kind of want to hold it"
2021-06-01 18:36:23,stocks,Good advice
2021-06-01 19:27:15,stocks,Don't need it yet? Id hold. I only have a fraction of that at 29. Ill likely hold & wait for a bottom to pile in. The dividend dropping means it a growth/value stock? Im not as up to date on the direction they are going..I am interested to see a Netflix /Dis+/amazon rival. But I also feel the streaming space is a little saturated.

2021-06-01 18:24:27,stocks,">that’s 98% loss of continuous data collection

..of continuous data collection *moving forward.* So what? They already have enough data on each user for 1000 lifetimes worth of ads. iOS 14 hurts every company with an ad platform. but it hurts facebook the least, because they have the most data by far. iOS 14 has ensured Snapchat will never come close to the amount of data facebook has, and thus will never have an ad platform as good as facebook's.

>the new IOS update will “hurt” small businesses

this is actually true. I run a small business, and facebook ads are our main source of revenue. If these get more expensive (which they probably will), it does hurt us. I have no idea to what extent. as an advertiser, I'm kind of banking on FB already having enough data to continue to be the best ad platform, regardless of whether they can continue to collect *even more* data."

2021-06-01 18:31:37,stocks,"I’m not saying Facebook will be bankrupt, but this will hurt them and set them back from reaching their 2021 goals. 

As an iPhone user I can’t remember the amount of times I’d see the exact things I searched or talked about on Instagram being advertised to me. If I’m thinking about buying an item and leave it in my shopping cart I see it on Instagram. 

Ever since the update, my adds are still things that interest me… as I expect since they have my data already. But it is a lot less appealing and attractive, and I know my friends also felt this difference. 

Now the only data they can keep collecting is from my usage of their apps which is still good, but not what they were planning for financially in 2021.

Additionally I’d like to make a case that I’m someone who plays both sides. 

Early 2020 before everyone started to see FB’s value during the pandemic I posted about it.
I just recently sold my shares and added some put options.

FB is already 2 days after the peak, worse value."
2021-06-01 18:25:54,stocks,"Somebody is lying.

If it didn't hurt FB they wouldn't care. Hell Zuck has made his brand by buying competition so, if it made that easier I doubt he'd come out against it."
2021-06-01 19:25:25,stocks,">Now the only data they can keep collecting is from my usage of their apps which is still good, but not what they were planning for financially in 2021.

I agree that it's not what they were planning for, but the addition of ""financially"" I disagree with. I think this for a few reasons:

1. [80% of FB mobile users access the app on android](https://blog.hootsuite.com/facebook-statistics/#:~:text=17.,access%20the%20app%20on%20Android). These numbers vary, but it's unanimously well over 50%. Checking my business manager over the last year, about 60-70% of my conversions come from Android. so \~35% of my potential conversions are *maybe* going to suffer a bit? Not worried

2. They make money from advertisers spending money on the platform, not from continually collecting data. Advertisers aren't leaving. if advertising were a basketball game, iOS 14 cut off everybody's legs. But facebook is already up 1000 to nothing. They're just winning so badly, and will continue to do so

3. Facebook has been on a constant tirade of banning ad accounts. Search on youtube and/or reddit: ""what to do if facebook bans your facebook business account."" It's actually a very common problem, and has been for the last year+. They're actually just banning the shit out of every account that is remotely sketchy, or selling shitty products, or just for no apparent reason. Would they be banning advertisers en masse if they were worried about iOS 14? I don't think so

&#x200B;

The only threat I see is if TikTok and Snapchat can both come out with solid platforms  (maybe also etsy/ pinterest/ etc). This is actually a way bigger threat than iOS 14 imo. Nice play on FB last year, and this one might play out. But if it does it'll be tiktok and snapchat that do it I think. I'd keep an eye on youtube, and r/PPC for posts about those ad platforms and see how they're coming along. FWIW I'm also looking into snapchat ads at the moment because everyone is super low on FB/ FB ads. Which tells me calls are the play rn haha"

However if you do that this amount is added to your cost basis so over many years you may have put in $10,000 and had $2500 in dividends paid, your cost basis is now $12,500 since the $2500 was already taxed, thus if you sold for $20,000 only $7500 is taxed as a capital gain, NOT $10,000.

You should though be getting a form each year for these accounts that you use to formulate your tax returns. NOT financial advise nor am I the IRS. Consult your financial advisor or the IRS for more information because like the rest of us here...we like yellow crayons and Elmer's glue. One note....Everyone should open and be funding a ROTH IRA. This is after tax money you fund the ROTH IRA with up to IRS limitations each year. The beauty of these is that all gains and your principal is tax free! Did I say TAX FREE!?

2021-06-01 19:28:19,stocks,If  you put an Roth IRA you will not need to file anything. Dividends will be reinvested and kept in the account and there’s no cap gains so may be a good way to go that route.

I use Almond Milk in my coffee and tea. I use Coconut milk for baking and mostly buy Coconut milk based frozen deserts.

Oatly has done a great job marketing their brand sure. But I do not think it'll replace Dairy as people begin coming off it (they have been globally en masse and its a trend thats not going to stop). But it's almost kinda culty in a way too. 

I tell people who are curious to buy the small cartons and experiment and see what they like best. And tell them that each has different strengths for different purposes."
2021-06-01 16:08:26,stocks,"Curious, as someone who also cares a lot about nutrition and I think plant-based milk is much much healthier than cow milk. My brother who is getting a degree in nutritional science agrees with me that out of all the vegan substitutes, plant-based milk is definitely one of the ones healthier than its non-vegan alternatives. I'm more worried people will continue to eat and McDonalds and Burger King, you know tings that are actually extremely unhealthy and super popular. What is in oatly that is so unhealthy?

Personally I think oatly is healthy and I find it upsetting that they are required to label 7g of 'added sugar' to their nutrition facts when there is no added sweeteners to oatly oatmilk. I think this argument falls in line with the same uneducated things that influencers like Joe Rogan say about Beyond Meat and stuff being unhealthy just because they haven't taken the time to actually research what goes into it. Not understanding something doesn't make it bad."

2021-06-01 15:18:08,stocks,"If they use cheese in several of their products, you know dairy not plant-based, then I have no idea why people consider this a 'plant-based' stock. Also, not bashing TTCF but I really dislike most of their products compared to oatly, I actually really like their oat milk and ice creams. Both are definitely overpriced for the amount you get though. I've tried like 5 ttcf food products and haven't enjoyed any of them."

2021-06-01 16:32:17,stocks,"Let me be clear: plant-based milks are awesome. I prefer almond, soy, and other plant milk alternatives. The second ingredient in oatly is rapeseed oil (canola oil) which surely isn’t too healthy. I can’t get over that."
2021-06-01 14:06:02,stocks,I like almond or coconut milk so I was so excited to try the oat milk but it tasted so almost burnt? Maybe It was a bad batch but I couldn’t even swallow it.

2021-06-01 16:59:41,stocks,"It's an odd one, but if you ever made oat milk at home you'd know why. 

Basically after an hour or so the water and the oats begin to seperate as the oat 'dust' settles at the bottom leaving the water back on top. To stop this happening you'd use a vegetable oil to hold the two together - you absolutely still need to shake to combine, but it's not so offensive if you completely forget.

Seriously unshaken oat milk without oil is the worst!"
2021-06-01 19:39:46,stocks,"The second ingredient in milk is milkfat at 0-4% depending on what you drink. And people eat and drink WAY MORE milk than they do oat milk. It’s in everything, from baked goods to cereals to added protein in processed foods. I think having some canola oil in your diet is perfectly fine because as a milk substitute there is no question that oat milk can be just as healthy just by counting the macronutrients."
2021-06-01 14:44:37,stocks,"It really comes down to how it's steamed/prepared.

Oat milk seems to have a sweet spot in temperature that is lower compared to dairy milk. Most Barista's don't realize this and warm it up to the same temperature as dairy.. which causes oatmilk to lose a lot it's taste and creaminess. One particular brand that seems really bad for this is Minor Figures. Oatly is about the middle, where as Pacifica and Earth Own seem a bit more resistant to overheating. I'm in Canada, so sadly haven't had the chance to taste Califa Farms version.

Any case, I've had some coffee drinks with Minor Figures that frankly, taste terrible (Oatly as well). When properly heated though, it's fantastic and tastes better than dairy (in my opinion)"

2021-06-01 11:56:08,stocks,"I am by no means an expert on this topic but I can add the few things I know: since this company issued stock it supposedly had to be incorporated somewhere. Presumably Pennsylvania. There has to be a record of that. There you can check if the company still exists or has been sold or is defunct or whatever it’s current status is. If the company still exists in some way, you can check with them, since these seem to be registered shares (i. e to someone’s name) any company that has issued shares will keep a record of that ( for various purposes, for example dividends) there is also in general the possibility that at some point in time the shares where declared unclaimed property.  Which in some jurisdictions means they are sold and the money is kept by the state for a predetermined amount of time. In others the shares are just held indefinitely, as far as I am aware. In the US I believe every state has its own unclaimed property system, you need to check those. How you can claim that money if it still exists, I don’t know since you are not a benificiary of any will or something like that, if you find a substantial amount of money that you belief you can and should claim, contact a lawyer at that point, I‘d say."

2021-06-01 00:00:00,stocks,Cloudera buyout not making sense $CLDR They have around 293 million shares outstanding so the deal would be around $4.6 billion dollars at the $16 a share that is being reported yet they announced $5.3 billion for the deal which would be be $18 dollars a share.  So why did they announce they are being bought out at 16 dollars a share but the deal is $5.3 billion in their press release? Anyone have any idea what is going on here? A $2 dollar difference is kind of a big deal so it definitely has me curious on what is occurring.
2021-06-01 11:42:41,stocks,"That 5.3 billion is the enterprise value, not the market cap, as Cloudera has ~700m dollar debt.

When you buy the company completely, as a owner you are responsible to also pay back the debt that Cloudera had borrowed earlier.

So new owners will pay existing shareholders $4.6 billion (market cap) and will pay $700 m to close those open debts. Hence as buyers, they pay $5.3 billion"
2021-06-01 14:20:11,stocks,"Quick question on this too... If CLDR is being bought out, what happens to the ticker when it goes private? Does that mean we have to sell when that happens?"

There is also an “[investigation](https://halpersadeh.com/actions/cloudera-inc-cldr-stock-merger/)” into the price offered for the shares.

2021-06-01 13:47:38,stocks,nothing will happen from the lawsuits. They are standard practice.
2021-06-01 13:28:56,stocks,"Mostly, the buyers will acquire the liability as of now on their balance sheet first, so that whenever the payment comes up in the future, the buyers will be responsible for the payment."
2021-06-01 18:22:02,stocks,"To clarify the buyers actually need to either settle the debt or come to terms with the creditor (usually for the same terms just now with the new debtor) prior to sale.  

It’s like you sell your home, the bank that carries the mortgage isn’t just going to let the new buyer take over the home without the loan either being paid off or the new buyer coming to new terms with the new debtor (not typical for sfr but happens with commercial properties)"

2021-06-01 00:00:00,stocks,"SoFi/IPOE merger went through I am a little confused. I have very little experience investing and that merger was the first one that I have seen. I have IPOE shares, as of today the combined stock should start trading under the ticker SOFI. But I only see SOFIW, which is for warrants that I cannot buy from my country right now. 

I’m guessing I maybe misunderstood something, but shouldn’t my ticker for IPOE shares change to SOFI and SOFI ticker appear?"

2021-06-01 00:00:00,stocks,"[Question] If I think a stock is going to split is there a way I can buy at the split price? Is that just a limit order?

Would a limit order even work for a split since the price jumps drastically. Seems like limit is buy when it hits a certain price. I want “if price is less than $500 buy x amount.”

I was looking at Amazon and I imagine sometime in the next several years they might split and I wanna get in at the split


Last, is there anyway to guess what the split amount might be? Could i assume splits are used to make the price under 100."
2021-06-01 09:57:52,stocks,i mean like just wait for the split to happen...???
2021-06-01 10:10:33,stocks,"You shouldn’t be concerned about buying a stock at its split. It does not change the value of the company.  It only changes the stock price which psychologically makes the company more enticing for people to buy. 

If you truly believe in a company just buy the stock and hold. 

Do some research on how to measure the value of a company."
2021-06-01 09:59:11,stocks,No there is no way to do that before the split.  If you have a limit order today and they split tomorrow your limit order will be adjusted to be the new number of shares at the new price for the same total cost.  So if you set a limit order at the new price ahead of time it will be adjusted down to an even lower price that will never hit.
2021-06-01 14:46:09,stocks,Username checks out.
2021-06-01 17:04:27,stocks,"It’s impossible to know when a company will split, let alone by what ratio, before they announce it.

Why does it even matter? If the stock price is too high, many brokers allow you to buy partial shares. Otherwise, there’s no strategy here that will confer any tangible benefit to you."
2021-06-01 10:07:23,stocks,"Just because a stock price is high doesn’t mean a split is coming. Ie, Berkshire A shares."
2021-06-01 10:30:38,stocks,"If you can’t afford to buy one share, use a broker who allows you to buy partial shares. Otherwise, according to your own thesis, you’re waiting to buy when Amazon will be more expensive."
2021-06-01 13:02:17,stocks,why do you want to get in specifically at the split?
2021-06-01 10:13:14,stocks,[deleted]
2021-06-01 10:15:46,stocks,Yeah. I keep hearing this. Do you know why? Seems kinda odd to me because lower price = more people buy stock = price go up = more benefits for company.
2021-06-01 10:39:29,stocks,I was gonna buy a few who shares now (whenever the hell robinhood deposits my money) but I just thought about how splits usually give a price boost instantly and would allow for more affordable shares.
2021-06-01 17:20:51,stocks,I just noticed when stocks split the price seems to shoot up for the first few hours.
2021-06-01 10:13:46,stocks,so..just buy it now?
2021-06-01 10:17:37,stocks,"Less people can afford stock = tends to be less volatile. Less volatility is attractive to high worth investors.

If you are convinced a company will drop a stock split and that split will also increase the market cap, then just buy now. You're getting in before the event you are expecting to bring the value up anyways."
2021-06-01 10:19:59,stocks,That's not how stocks work.  Your fascination with splits is completely misplaced.  Please learn stock fundamentals before putting money into the market.
2021-06-01 10:32:27,stocks,"You, retail investor who can’t afford one share of amazon, is not the target shareholder of amazon. That’s why they’re not catering to you. 

Retail traders can make a stock a lot more volatile—see G M E as an example. This is not considered a good thing by your typical management."
2021-06-01 10:19:43,stocks,"This artificially inflates the price of the company. 
Yes, some scenarios a stock split to raise capital is a good idea but not always."

2021-06-01 10:42:36,stocks,"I just asked a question about splits and if I can creates an order that buys in the event of a split.

2021-06-01 00:00:00,stocks,"Class action lawsuits, help please. I have a position in Danimer Scientific. DNMR. A Wall Street Journal article came out calling the company out for making errors and fraudulent reports. Needless to say the stock price went down a lot....
Everyday there are new class action lawsuits being filed. Should I join one or do nothing. PS I am hyper aware of the risks of investing. Thanks for any and all information."
2021-06-01 09:57:39,stocks,What happens is a court takes all of the various lawsuits and generally consolidates them into one and then proceeds with the case. The entire process takes a long time so you probably have years to be able to join the lawsuit and be awarded money. In all likelihood you (as a shareholder) would actually be contacted by a law firm. It doesn’t hurt to sign up now but there’s no rush and you won’t benefit from signing up for all of them.
2021-06-01 12:20:35,stocks,"These lawsuits are dime a dozen and a normal part of doing business.  Just look at practically any tech or EV company.  The vast majority of them never see the inside of a courtroom.  The law firms are just trying to see how many people they can get signed up and how much the company is willing to give them to go away.  And as someone else mentioned, your likelihood of getting any meaningful money (or any money) is slim to none."
2021-06-01 10:35:15,stocks,"In these cases, it’s more trouble than it’s worth. You’ll spend more time filling forms and sending your entire brokerage history (perhaps through the mail, as some firms require) then you’ll actually get in money. If you’re a whale with a lot of money on the line you’re not joining a class action; if you’re a retail trader you might see a buck or two while the lawyers make out with a nice payday."
2021-06-01 16:57:41,stocks,Never give these lawsuits any thought . Most of them are filed by people that have huge short positions against that company and they are just trying to drive the price downward.
2021-06-01 17:21:53,stocks,"Yes, they are totally not lawyers behind a firm but a big bad man who shorted the company."
2021-06-01 00:00:00,stocks,"SCR | The Next Great, Canadian, Tech-Enabled Opportunity 🚀🍁 Hear me out on this one as we are on the brink of theScore's BIGGEST catalyst.

The stock is traded on the NASDAQ & TSX under ticker: SCR

**Some context on the company and it’s industries (Sports Media/Sports Betting):**

TheScore mobile is the number 1 most used sports app in Canada with 10 times more users than ESPN. It’s one of the most used sports mobile apps in all of North America citing almost 4 BILLION user sessions over the last year. They have industry leading rates of user engagement at an average of 130 minutes per visitor with each user opening the app an average of 125 times a month.

This engagement is due to the many features in the app including: real-time sports news, live scores, in-game highlights, a social ecosystem where fans can chat and discuss live games, add friends, send private messages, etc. They have original media content, in-game odds, sports betting content and even personalized promos for bettors based on their in-app media interests. They’ve reported close to 4 million unique users per month.

TheScore achieved this success despite being a small company against industry titans. They’re no stranger to being an underdog which now follows them in the mobile sports betting industry. PASPA was repealed in 2018 allowing individual states to offer legalized, regulated sports betting. The North American opportunity for this industry is estimated to represent a $US 22 billion opportunity by 2025.

theScore made the decision in 2019 to enter the market as an operator in [NJ through a partnership with Darby Development](https://mobile.thescore.com/2019/09/introducing-thescore-bet-thescores-mobile-sportsbook-launches-in-new-jersey/) with their Score Bet app. They have since expanded operations to a total of 4 betting states (NJ, CO, IN, IO) and have acquired market access agreements across 14 states via a [partnership with Penn National](https://mobile.thescore.com/2019/07/thescore-and-penn-national-gaming-enter-into-strategic-multi-state-market-access-partnership/) and other market access deals ([CZR deal](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210329005427/en/theScore-Secures-Market-Access-for-Mobile-Sports-Betting-in-Illinois-Through-Agreement-with-Caesars-Entertainment)) which represent more than 30% of the U.S. population and a $US 8.2 billion opportunity for them. The CEO and founder, John Levy, has stated that by next year they will be operating in at least double the amount of states and that they’ll be active in 35 States within 3 to 5 years.

TheScore recently rebuilt their media app completely in-house to increase its performance, stability, and scalability, likely related to continued user growth and future betting integrations. They’ve built their “Fuse” and “Bet Section” as a fully integrated approach to link their gaming and media apps. Users of both apps can now build their bet slip while benefiting from all of theScore’s features. When they’re ready to finalize their bet, they’ll be taken to the [Score Bet app](https://www.thescore.bet/) to place their bet or cash out. This is a defining feature that their highly engaged userbase will remember and one that will lead to higher rates of retention vs competitors that treat the bet as just a transaction. This approach not only increases retention rates but also greatly reduces their customer acquisition costs in an industry that is renowned for not having brand loyalty.

The New Jersey handle (Percentage of the total amount of bets taken in the State) rose 195% versus the prior year, validating that their unique combination of media and betting remains a powerful differentiating factor against competitors in their oldest operating State. Total gaming handle also grew 46% overall compared to the previous quarter. They are the only media company to be operating their own book and they’ve been seeing these early signs of success. Other companies have started to take notice as they’ve been buying or partnering with media companies via expensive deals (ex: [DKNG 1](https://www.sportico.com/business/sports-betting/2021/draftkings-buys-vsin-1234625970/), [DKNG 2](https://www.draftkings.com/about/news/2020/09/draftkings-and-espn-enter-into-co-exclusive-content-integration-agreement/?wpsrc=Organic%20Search&wpaffn=Google&wpkw=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.draftkings.com%2Fabout%2Fnews%2F2020%2F09%2Fdraftkings-and-espn-enter-into-co-exclusive-content-integration-agreement%2F&wpcn=about&wpscn=news%2F2020%2F09%2Fdraftkings-and-espn-enter-into-co-exclusive-content-integration-agreement%2F), [PENN](https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/1/29/21113130/barstool-sports-penn-national-deal-dave-portnoy-chernin), [FOX](https://www.starsgroup.com/press-center/the-stars-group-news/the-stars-group-and-fox-sports-announce-historic-u-s-media-and-sports-wagering-partnership)). However, they have not been able to develop the same seamless approach that theScore has attained internally.

theScore, like all other sports betting companies is currently sitting at a negative EBITDA. They reported a loss of (17.5 M) in the last quarter. This is because we are still in the early days of a high-growth industry. Companies have to get passed all of the free promotions and incentives that are offered, Market entry costs, etc and then they have to retain their users to start seeing profits. They reported a handle of 81,6 million, a 491% YoY increase, with Net gaming revenue being ($2.4M) and a media revenue of $8.0 M, a 17% increase.

theScore is not the loudest nor the flashiest betting operator. You won’t see Score ads like you do with some other companies because they’re targeting their existing userbase in a way that is financially responsible. They aren't aiming to do flashy deals. They won’t win by trying to outspend the big guys, but they already know this, as it’s a situation that they've already been through. Instead they're growing their numbers organically with their customer focus.

**So, what’s this huge catalyst that I spoke of?**

The Legalization of Mobile Sports Betting in Canada, where theScore Media app is a household name will [likely take place](https://nationalpost.com/news/politics/here-are-the-liberal-bills-likely-to-pass-this-spring-and-others-that-could-be-doomed-by-an-election) within the next 3 weeks or earlier.

Last week, bill C-218 passed its 2nd reading in the Senate, this is often where the biggest risk lies.

Tomorrow, it will be studied by a Standing Committee. After passing that stage it will then move to 3rd reading before becoming law.

The bill is supported by provincial bodies, [by every major sports league](https://www.gamblingnews.com/news/cga-major-sports-leagues-support-the-push-for-single-event-wagering/), and even sports broadcast companies as their viewership numbers continue to decline. It just so happens that the [Deputy Chair of the reviewing committee](https://sencanada.ca/en/senators/smith-larry-w/) also served as [Commissioner of the Canadian Football League (CFL)](https://www.tsn.ca/cfl/video/cfl-hopes-for-the-pass-of-bill-c-218-in-order-to-boost-future-revenue~2205144).

The opportunity presented by this bill passing is forecasted to be US$4 to US$5+ billion at maturity. TheScore is actively preparing for this opportunity and extremely well-positioned to benefit long-term as Canada’s leading mobile sports media brand.

10% penetration of the Canadian Market = $US 400 Million15% penetration of the Canadian Market = $US 625 Million20% penetration of the Canadian Market = $US 850 Million

The current market cap is valued at $US 843.647M which indicates that this legalization is not currently priced in, as it wouldn't take into consideration everything else that theScore has built. The stock’s technicals have bottomed out and we can finally see that the trend is reversing. All of this, combined with SCR’s low float will mean an explosive next few weeks.

**Bonus info about eSports:**

\- Gen Z is half as likely as millennials to watch live sports and 2x more likely to never watch

\- 35% of Gen Z identify as eSports fans, a higher percentage than NASCAR, MLB and NHL

\- There’s a potential for \~6 million new bettors with an outsized affinity for eSports over the next five years

\- 495 million people watched eSports online or on television in 2020, worldwide and viewers are projected to grow to 646 million by 2023.

eSports betting will be one of the biggest categories of sports betting over the long term, if not the biggest. theScore eSports has the #1 esports media following with 186.5 million reported video views in their most recent quarter, which represents a 139% YoY growth and an average social media reach of 88 million a month. Guess who’s actively seeking and preparing opportunities to enter this space?

**TLDR:** PEOPLE LIKE GAMBLING ON SPORTS AND ESPORTS. SCR, the #1 Canadian Sports Media app entered Sports Betting and is seeing encouraging results. They’re also the leading eSports media brand and are actively seeking to enter esports betting which will eventually become one of the biggest betting categories.

Legalization of Canadian Sports betting is expected in the next weeks + US Sports betting expansion means that this company is extremely undervalued for its future potential in a $US 22 Billion industry. 🚀"

At least that is my goal. I don't know how she makes 10% off of diviend tho. Most high dividends stocks/etf will offer between 4-6%. And if you want an even safer investment stock (as you should if you are retired) then it will possibly be around 3-4%. So my goal is to transition slowly to that type of investing as I approach retirement.   


In otherwords, its an awesome strategy but it gets better the less time you have until retirement. At first you might wanna start with SP500 and qqq. They are more risky. But over 20-30 years they will be MUCH better than dividend stocks, imo."

It makes more sense for older people who need the income, and for whom growth is less important because they have less time left. 10% dividends in this environment actually carry a fair amount of risk though. That's pretty far in excess of the risk-free rate, and there is always a chance of capital loss. Dividend stocks tend to suffer when interest rates rise because they're competing with a higher risk-free rate, and there's less reason to take on equity risk for dividends when you can get a decent return risk-free."
2021-06-01 11:46:40,stocks,"A company doesnt just print money, it has to come from somewhere (obviously). Companies that pay dividends usually have worse stock appreciation (the value of the actual stock going up) because they are paying money to shareholders instead of buying back shares or reinvesting. 

There's nothing wrong with this, but it also doesnt mean you can't earn more with capital appreciation. Buying back shares is just the new hip way companies are doing things because it's tax free for thier investors until they sell.

Unless you're crazy rich, you will have to take your gains and liquidate at some point and dividends are a great way of doing that."
2021-06-01 10:56:10,stocks,"Given the lack of details, either you or your mom is lying. There are stocks that return 10% dividend, but they almost never last. 

My returns are higher than 10%. Dividends are typically a small part of that."
2021-06-01 12:14:51,stocks,"10% yield is not available in financially sound companies. 

10% off the cost is doable. However 10% actually isn't that good depending on when she started."
2021-06-01 11:11:31,stocks,"Depends how old you are and how much income you already have. I’m 37 and I own a few dividend stocks but honestly I don’t give a shit about income from my portfolio. I’d much rather be in growth until I’m 60 or so and then transition. Even then, I hope I’m in a position to transition only part of it to dividends."
2021-06-01 16:08:12,stocks,"If you're talking a 10% dividend yield, that's likely a very risky dividend."
2021-06-01 19:46:24,stocks,The mistake you're making is assuming that reddit makes up the universe.
2021-06-01 10:21:53,stocks,"Any idea what her portfolio looks like, ie holdings ? Asking for a friend, not future me."
2021-06-01 09:39:33,stocks,She prob has $500K or so. It seems like a lot of money but also not unreasonable for someone in 40s-50s. So she can bring in $50k per year. Even with average expenses thats a livable income.
2021-06-01 09:40:33,stocks,She’s for sure more financial advisor then 99.99% of those reddit users
2021-06-01 10:41:41,stocks,Most likely qyld no growth but steady 10%
2021-06-01 10:44:25,stocks,"Hmm. So you are saying is that her investment has been doing great because of great bull run and, more importantly, very low interest rates for a number of years?"
2021-06-01 10:59:21,stocks,"Lol it’s completely possible, its Reddit after all. I have genuine interest thus the question. Also, she lives in something and I know her approximate expenses so she would need right around that $50k a year. I am going to ask her for statements."
2021-06-01 16:11:08,stocks,"Last year Lumen technologies had a >10% dividend yield @ around $9-10. I bought a bunch because it was clear that they were in an industry that is fairly stable and in a position to survive the pandemic(telecommunications), and the low interest rate market would do them a ton to address their debt concerns. Based on my analysis it was very unlikely they would cut the dividend as free cash flow easily covered it with plenty leftover, but they were in a position to continuously reduce their interest expense by paying down their debt or securing better financing.

I ended up selling at around $14-15, buying back in around $12, then selling again at $14. Made a huge profit. If the price didn't go back up, I'd have happily held for the dividend."
2021-06-01 11:14:12,stocks,Well thats the common age-based methodology that we know.  But with like for like returns wouldn’t you invest with less riskier assets?
2021-06-01 19:56:00,stocks,No assumption here. Just want to get some feedback
2021-06-01 10:31:14,stocks,I never took much interest in her investments since she is doing ok and never asked for any assistance. Buy now I am more curious and will ask for a couple of statements. I will post here once I see her positions.
2021-06-01 09:44:00,stocks,"Ya, for sure. To live off a div payment you’d need at least 500k. Congrats to her, that is a difficult thing to do for most people."
2021-06-01 10:10:52,stocks,"Not even considering herself any kind of professional. She is retired and only does income investments. I am sure finding these investments is basic research. 10% is a great return. In 2020 she made more money because these investments supposedly pay more when market is in recession, even a temporary one. In bull markets they pay a bit less but % is more consistent"
2021-06-01 19:40:51,stocks,I came here to say she's probably qyld gang member
2021-06-01 11:47:48,stocks,"She is probably making 10% off her initial investment and current yields are likely way lower because stocks have appreciated so much. There are basically two ways to get 10% return on dividends. One is to invest in companies with continually increasing dividends. You buy in and the dividend is maybe 5%, but over a few decades, it might become 10% or more. The other way is to buy near the bottom when things look horrific. I bought Exxon and Valero when they cratered and have almost a 10% yield off my investment I put into those. Will that dividend hold for another 20 years? Probably not, but it's nice right now."
2021-06-01 11:25:00,stocks,"Agree that your mom's returns are possible. I'm guessing she bought in those high div yield stocks during market crashes and the likes. To answer your question, people have different risk profiles and different portfolio sizes so what might look good for one might not work for the other."
2021-06-01 11:34:09,stocks,"Sorry, he’s right. There is nothing that returns 10% that most people consider safe. Either it is super risky, or in a dying industry and steadily shrinking.

Forget Reddit, In a 0% interest rate environment, good companies yielding 10% would be snapped up by rich investors in a heartbeat and thus bid up and no longer yield 10% anymore for the later investors.

> This seems like a great return so my question is why don’t most investors do this type of investing vs growth or value?

You answered your own question - if it’s too good to be true, it isn’t true. I’m not saying dividend investing is a bad idea, but don’t expect 10% returns."
2021-06-01 18:48:48,stocks,"LUMN is now at around 7%, only confirming that a 10% dividend doesn't last. Either the stock gets more expensive (because who doesn't want 10%) or the dividend is not sustainable."
2021-06-01 11:31:34,stocks,"Yes, absolutely. If the returns are like for like I’ll choose less risk every time. The risk/reward still pays off at this point with growth stocks though."
2021-06-01 19:57:50,stocks,"> why don’t most investors do this type of investing vs growth or value?

This is what you said.  There is an assumption there, gumby."
2021-06-01 15:24:36,stocks,"Fully understand that, not sure why people seem to think there’s a problem with this question.. my apologies if it was rude, thanks for your response tho."
2021-06-01 09:56:01,stocks,"Sure. But someone with 401k would be better of putting most money into such investments that get average 5-6% from stock market, or hope for really excellent year with 10%+ returns."
2021-06-01 10:26:54,stocks,"Me neither, if she got that amount of money to live with those 10% she or your dad did something right in their days before. 
But that’s the goal! Just to live of your passive income."
2021-06-01 11:16:22,stocks,Lolol do you mean the dividend yield goes up every time the stock goes down?
2021-06-01 11:55:12,stocks,"Yeah so some other folks said something similar is that her initial investment was years ago. So I i try same investment today my return would be much smaller. Makes sense. However, I know that she actively manages her account. Not sure how much re-positioning she does though."
2021-06-01 17:34:14,stocks,"There is a third way. Any company can offer 10% dividends, just don't expect them to be in business much longer than 10-12 years. ""Looks like a dividend but is actually return of capital"" is a thing that sometimes happens, often with scams."
2021-06-01 11:41:02,stocks,Right so I agree with you. I kinda feel bad asking my mom for her statements in fear that I might expose that she has not been telling while truth 😔. But I think its worth it to find out.
2021-06-01 12:08:49,stocks,Sure about that? GAB and QYLD come to mind.
2021-06-01 15:35:51,stocks,"No problem. Its all educational, for mw as well."
2021-06-01 10:31:58,stocks,I’m not sure what you’re arguing for lol. 10% Ann is pretty good especially for a div. If you can secure that over long term I don’t see why someone would go for 5-6% div (which is still high) you could easily just compound the div payment if you don’t want to cash it in
2021-06-01 10:28:58,stocks,Yeah she had a business with her ex. Got out with about 800k and then made a bad business investment and lost about half. I would guess she operates now with about 500k
2021-06-01 11:18:54,stocks,"That was her observation from 2020. She was worried that market plunge would impact her income but instead she received higher returns during the month of feb-july, and then it started to go back down as market was recovering."
2021-06-01 11:58:30,stocks,"She can't do much if she's keeping 10% off an initial investment. If you bought something like Southern Company 20 or 30 years ago, you'll be making way over 10% off the initial investment today, but if you rebalance and sell, there's nothing you can buy that is gonna carry anywhere near that return on your original principal today. 

You have to have time on your side to get those returns of capital over time unless you are willing to take huge gambles on asset classes that become ""uninvestable"" in a crisis and the pundits are all wrong."
2021-06-01 10:47:55,stocks,I am not arguing. My question is that why is this not a preferred investment over riskier investments typically recommended to younger investors if historic rate is 8-10% in hood years.
2021-06-01 12:12:04,stocks,"If you get paid $1 dividend and stock is at $20 than you have a 5% payout. Stock crashes and is trading at $10 now you have a 10% payout. Income didn’t go up, your yield did."
2021-06-01 12:02:04,stocks,See my edit to original post.
2021-06-01 11:16:48,stocks,"Dividends can get cut. Check the history on her stocks. Typically REITs have higher dividends but are risky w the market. No dividend is guaranteed and the highest dividend stocks are sacrificing growth to pay that money out, which can hurt in the long run if they hit a downturn.

Imagine the divs are cut in half and you are relying on the 10% to live"
2021-06-01 11:42:45,stocks,"Oh, I think it’s solely for the reason that it’s not as exciting. I have been doing a reit play for a long time. As someone mentioned there is a possibility it could be cut but that’s why you do research. It’s much easier to predict if a div will be cut than speculate a price increase. 

Imo the only reason people aren’t doing an approach like this is because they think only high risk high reward."
2021-06-01 12:22:40,stocks,Hmm. Ok makes sense. I am sure she was commenting on $ return though because thats what would matter t her.
2021-06-01 11:43:38,stocks,That’s not how a reit works.. the div is higher because of a real estate tax break
2021-06-01 11:45:37,stocks,Maybe you are right for retail investors. But wouldn’t big money take advantage of this opportunity?
2021-06-01 12:23:56,stocks,"Yeah this is a common dividend misconception, highly doubt companies start giving out more money when they are struggling."
2021-06-01 11:56:49,stocks,Right and REITs have to pay out a certain % of their income and whatnot. I was trying to cover both high div stocks and REITS
2021-06-01 11:47:45,stocks,"They most certainly do. I forget the exact number but I believe it was more than 80% of the s&p500 investments are recurring dividend payments.

It’s a smart observation, check out portfolio theory. It’s an easy approach to this"
2021-06-01 00:00:00,stocks,"Morning Update for Tuesday, 06/01/21 Good morning everyone.

*This list is geared towards day trading. With the momentum watchlist especially, I am typically in and out very quickly, only occasionally longer than a couple minutes, usually faster scalps.* Always have a plan when you enter a trade (for profit taking and for taking a loss), and use proper risk management for your account.

**Main Watchlist:**

Gapping UP: BABA, NIO, AMD, BA, UAL, CLDR, AMC

Gapping DOWN: ZIM, CVAC, LEDS

**Momentum Watchlist**

* VTNR (+25%): Up on momentum from past couple days of trading, as well as another price target upgrade. Seeing good volume and price action in premarket. Could see more upwards movement today with the momentum, but I'll be cautious, as this could get over-extended. 
* OEG (+45%): Up after announcing its recently acquired subsidiary reached an agreement for a 700-mile construction project in Mississippi. Seeing strong volume and price action at the moment, I'll be watching to see if the momentum continues.
* LCTX (+10%): Up after reporting additional cases of retinal tissue restoration in patients treated with their drug. Seeing okay volume and price action in premarket. Daily chart looks bullish so I'll be keeping an eye on this one. 
* AKBA (+8%): Up after FDA set action date for their anemia drug. Seeing decent price action and volume in premarket. 
* APOP (+13%): Couldn't find a relevant catalyst. Daily chart looks bullish, so I'll be keeping an eye on this one.

**Market Outlook:**

The market is showing strength this morning, and stocks are looking to open higher after the long weekend. SPY is trading just over 422, and we should finally see that push to new ATH. DIA is a bit further off from ATH levels, trading just above 348. Tech stocks are up in premarket, but lagging a bit behind the overall market. Gold and silver are green at the moment, and crude oil is up quite a bit this morning. Bitcoin is currently trading around 36,400, and most cryptos look pretty bearish at the moment. Crypto-related stocks are somewhat mixed in premarket trading. Marijuana stocks are showing some strength in premarket trading and are worth following with some potential upcoming catalysts. HITID (new ticker HITI) is being uplisted to Nasdaq today, so it will be one to watch in the near future. Meme stocks are also showing signs of continued strength, and will be worth following this week.

Remember to use proper risk management, by making sure you size appropriately for your account and have a plan for every trade you enter (both for taking profits and cutting losses). Happy trading everyone :)"

Alibaba is the Amazon of China, that also competes in sectors such as AI, Cloud computing, B2B communications and online/otc transaction services. It has had some fantastic growth over the years, but its share price is currently stagnant.

I am a believer that when a company gets negative press for a sustained period, the market overreacts, and price opportunities occur.

I did the exact same post on FB a few months back before it recovered 😊

The overwhelming majority of analysts consider it a buy

&#x200B;

**Concerns**

\- China is a disaster when it comes to controlling its citizens, unfortunately, Jack Ma is no exception.

\- Alibaba is a massive company and constant government focus/fines will most likely stunt future growth.

\- I do not understand the Chinese economy and probably never will. This makes it almost impossible to predict future demand-side headwinds.

Finally, I want to apologise for how short this is, I am lazy. Also, this is not financial advice only my opinion."
2021-06-01 08:39:56,stocks,"Ah, the Alibaba daily post...

Gotta make sure everyone knows it's such a good buy..."
2021-06-01 17:43:49,stocks,"They make shit load of money, Munger owns a bunch. Yes CCP is a risk, but this thing will go up higher"
2021-06-01 19:26:14,stocks,"Completely agree with you, seems like an obvious buy based on analysts and the munger move plus the fact that it the best (or second best) Chinese company out there based on growth and revenues. The whole CCP distrust out there has no merit in my opinion and it seems like a great discounted stock to buy. Put my entire portfolio in it like a week ago and already at like +5%. Not gonna hold until 300+ if it ever gets there tho, I feel like it’ll hit 250ish very soon then take a while to hit 300+ so I’ll probs cash out for a quick 20%"

2021-06-01 08:26:19,stocks,"Chinese companies will always trade at a discount to fair value because of their government. They would benefit significantly from foreign investing, but until they step off from just doing whatever they want, they won’t ever get the trust of all foreign investors. 

They have a booming economy and would benefit significantly from foreign investing. I do own shares of Alibaba so it might just be a bit of personal bias."
2021-06-01 08:15:05,stocks,Why we see the same post about Alibaba every week :D
2021-06-01 08:29:47,stocks,You could also take a look at Alibaba’s forward P/E. That is 17 which is crazy low considering the growth you just explained there.

Also, I like how you have the comparison right there. One suggestion though: if you have a 4 set like FB, MSFT, Goog, APPL, then you should use the same 4 set in the next comparison. Amazon is more apples to apples."

2021-06-01 08:58:09,stocks,"Two reasons actually: the Chinese Government and just the fact that it’s a Chinese company means you can’t be certain what might happen to them in the future. Second, you don’t even own Alibaba when you buy their stock, you own an off-shore holding company located in the Cayman Islands or something which is in agreement with BABA and the CCP.

If you own 9988, you own a piece of each of the smaller companies like you would with any other security. Why would you buy BABA and not Alibaba?"
2021-06-01 10:58:25,stocks,"So not even actually owning the company you invest in doesn’t concern you? If they “hold” these shares what happens if they get cut off for some reason by the CCP...?

It might not concern you, but it certainly concerns a lot of people which is why this company will always trade at a discount and there’s really no value. If market sentiment is permanently very negative how will it ever become fairly valued?"

I think Blackstone is a differentiator amongst its more conventional banks i.e GS, CS, UBS in the fact that it is much more aggressive in raising capital and deploying for M&A deals.
With the stock constantly pushing its own ATH, what is the consensus on BX? Upwards trend or sideways/downwards."
2021-06-01 07:48:37,stocks,Blackstone is completely different than a bank in a sense that it is Private Equity. I would advise you to do a lot more research.

Especially with the way so many companies are staying private longer and enjoying larger fundraising rounds seems like the PE giants are just going to keep growing, and get more value out of companies that would have once been public already. You just have to follow the fundraising rounds and get a feel for if they're overpaying and getting into bidding wars in the fundraising rounds."

2021-06-01 00:00:00,stocks,"ENX price history It's a question that has been bothering me since it happened, I tried to dig some information, but didn't find anything.

Recently (I believe after the acquisition of Borsa Italiana by Euronext on 29th of April), the sites I know started showing wrong history of this stock's prices. For example, here is the current graph.

[https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/EURONEXT-ENX/](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/EURONEXT-ENX/)

Take a look at points between August 2020 and March 2021: The maximum value, according to this graph, is about 97-98, then it declines and reaches about 86 at the end of February, then falls to about 73 and is currently at 88.25 (at the moment of me writing this).

However, if we take a look at some past screenshots/analytics/predictions (I've seen it with my own eyes, but it is anecdotic evidence, so I'm giving some proofs), so here is a link from the 6th of February

[https://www.tradingview.com/chart/ENX/9d7Sy6RK-ENX-is-in-a-beautiful-uptrend-channel/](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/ENX/9d7Sy6RK-ENX-is-in-a-beautiful-uptrend-channel/)

we clearly see that the graph as a whole was 10 EUR higher.

And it's not just this site's problem - I've just taken this as an example, feel free to look on other platforms.

My question is - what is going on? Is this deliberate or do you think it is a technical error? I find this extremely misleading, false past data may affect decisions on buying/selling stocks. I will go as far as to say that I question legitimacy of all other stocks information available unless verified using other data points."

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

2021-06-01 17:39:01,stocks,I expect another pullback soon but it'll be a good chance to load up if you believe in it. It's a little overpriced for my taste right now so I'm waiting for a bit. It's still a great long term hold though either way.

2021-06-01 11:36:19,stocks,"Average down on this. Even if manchin will trim the tax hike and spending bill there will likely still be quite significant child tax credits being passed. More free money and more kids pumping out means way more rent seekers. Also a lot more homebuyers because landlords will be the ones collecting all the free money by rent Housing and groceries are probably the only beneficiaries to these tax credits. Even without all these free money Zillow hasn’t stop growing, their stock price is volatile but the company is great. Probably one of the safest aggressive fintech growth stock in US you can find now. Zillow isn’t rising because some housing stocks are currently at lower PE. In the long run though the real estate sector should outperform big time under Biden’s reckless spending and vote buying policies."

2021-06-01 14:31:34,stocks,I prefer dividend stocks because they are less volatile. The companies are usually strong and are a bit more reliable in terms of returns. Plus the dividends are passive income/extra returns that I reinvest into more stock when there is a dip.
2021-06-01 14:07:09,stocks,"They're nice to have with the reinvestment and the stock growth. But you can also have a more aggressive approach, and when you are at a point to where you'd like to retire, or simply have added income, you could redistribute your portfolio to dividend dominant areas."

2021-06-01 15:16:24,stocks,"If you think the inflation isn't transitory, the conventional wisdom is to hedge against it with REITs like O."
2021-06-01 18:09:05,stocks,"Dividends are typically in mature companies with good cash flow. They have less potential upside than growth companies, but can provide a solid foundation and consistent growth via dividend reinvestments that growth stocks may or may not be able to provide given the economic conditions. I'm heavily leaning towards dividends in my portfolio because in the event that the market has forwarded a lot of growth, it might end up trading sideways for a long time and the dividends still get growth. If the market has a downturn, the dividends will be even more valuable because they can purchase more of the underlying stock. And also, dividend companies do still grow. 'O' is an REIT which is an income fund. If you get companies like TAP or KO or WMT, they will all still provide dividends (less than O), but the effect is compounded by them potentially growing in the future as well"
2021-06-01 05:50:11,stocks,What about JD?

Only thing I can say that's saving me (barring some decisions like getting into BB in the first place) is trying to approach every choice from the long position exclusively. Doesn't mean I won't sell out of BB today necessarily, but it does help fomo for sure."
2021-06-01 11:05:59,stocks,"Many people can't read the short interest and will buy a stock the second they read it enough times on the internet, so it's a great way to convince as many people to buy as possible, hoping the stock pumps as high as can be, which benefits everyone, since we can all get excited about getting richer, but then for people just a step ahead to quickly gradually exit in silence, before anyone catches on."

2021-06-01 19:16:03,stocks,Congrats we're still in this
2021-06-01 19:07:37,stocks,I bought 30 on Friday with a small amount simply to gamble. Wasn't excited until I just checked and it popped off in AH.
2021-06-01 17:50:18,stocks,Sell half?
2021-06-01 18:06:52,stocks,Do you believe in the company? Do you believe it will go back down in the future? Do you just want to get out of the position? Keep a close eye on it tomorrow. If it goes over $15 I will be happy af.
2021-06-01 08:23:00,stocks,"A general investment rule is don't try and time the market. If you choose not to invest now, you'll probably be looking back in 5 years time and be absolutely kicking yourself seeing all the gains you've missed out on."
2021-06-01 07:43:01,stocks,the massive growth was due to a 30% covid crash
2021-06-01 09:11:41,stocks,"Jpm is the creme of the crop.

Wfc has a good ceo in place, with some catalysts coming down the road. Cost cutting, asset cap lifting, and maybe substantial dividend hikes. Munger still owns it, though brk exited.

Idk anything about bac other than brk has a huge stake in it. Brkn basically cut all other banks to go all in BAC."
2021-06-01 09:29:04,stocks,"BAC is the best if you’re betting on inflation, JPM is the best financially at the moment. Their P/Es are incredibly low.

I have calls on JPM and BAC"
2021-06-01 10:05:09,stocks,CP is great pick but its near its all time high right now. A lot of possible KCS merger might be priced in. It might swing a lot as the story of CP/CN/KCS unravels. I don't know enough about the others to give good insight.
2021-06-01 10:27:53,stocks,Crazy how portfolios can be so different.  Im up almost 10% today and my entire account is finally in the green.
2021-06-01 10:38:37,stocks,When the merger is complete the ticker changes from the SPAC to the new acquired company ticker. Takes like a day sometimes.
2021-06-01 13:20:35,stocks,That NOVA was very cool.

2021-06-01 13:06:23,stocks,Fidelity does
2021-06-01 13:33:22,stocks,Maybe Compass?
2021-06-01 15:58:17,stocks,"I think EV's are doing well, probably trends with them."
2021-06-01 16:39:39,stocks,I've been enjoying that ETF
2021-06-01 12:04:13,stocks,"Why I wouldn't dare take bets on when that class of stocks become rational. Honestly, their management must be the biggest winners of this year by turning a loss making company (for years, mind you) into a cash pile by doing nothing but diluting shares."
2021-06-01 11:40:21,stocks,"I bought puts last week friday, expecting the hype to die over the weekend. I don't see it staying this high for too long."
2021-06-01 12:53:16,stocks,"Now imagine being me, who bought $30 puts Friday with 5/28 expiry expecting them to be closed out automatically at end of day with $3 profit, only to find TD exercised the fucking puts into a negative cash margined short position worth literally 60% of my fucking account value, only to automatically close it from a margin call first thing in the morning.  These motherfuckers wouldn’t let me short 60% negative but they exercise my put into it?  I took a 10% account value loss on options that were literally up 300% on Friday."
2021-06-01 19:43:13,stocks,I wouldn't
2021-06-01 12:44:18,stocks,its VERY low markecap. It moves big based on relatively tiny buys and sells.
2021-06-01 12:15:41,stocks,"Flat?! Everything’s booming! Xpev, Nio, BB, GME.."
2021-06-01 13:11:33,stocks,Like it
2021-06-01 14:12:57,stocks,"For a company losing $5B a year, sure."
2021-06-01 10:06:27,stocks,"You can try. When a bid ask spread is that wide it usually means there is very little volume for that contract, so it might not sell. But you can still set a limit sell for 0.3 and let that sit all day to see if it sells."
2021-06-01 10:33:40,stocks,"That's the price of your first lesson.  Mine was on DBE.  I bought it super cheap before oil started really taking off.  I expected by now to be up to $2 or $3.... the ask is that high.  Unfortunately, the bid is only .20c higher than what I bought it at."
2021-06-01 12:48:30,stocks,The bond story is just dying down. Not enough clicks to be had.
2021-06-01 14:08:37,stocks,I got in a few weeks ago. Up 17%.
2021-06-01 15:13:09,stocks,"Looking at BLK chart history, you could make a case that it's like the S&P 500 plus."
2021-06-01 15:13:21,stocks,I think banks move as a group.  You can't go wrong with XLF or IYF if you don't want to pick and choose.  I think the whole sector is going to continue to melt up.

2021-06-01 14:11:27,stocks,"Personally, Im nervous about bank stocks.  Artificial ZIRP policy, the reverse repo market is flooded with half a trillion dollars, inflation coming, 100,000s of mortgages about to be defaulted on, real estate prices parabolic, and treasuries trending upward without a Fed increased prime rate...... I think short term they are a good play.  3 months from now I'd steer clear.

SeekingAlpha has some really good analysis of bank stock prices vs interest rates in their archives."
2021-06-01 15:08:50,stocks,Now that we’re expecting it and taking some profits they’ll keep it green
2021-06-01 11:24:41,stocks,How the fuck did you manage to buy in last year and be in the red this long.
2021-06-01 10:39:11,stocks,I didn’t hear no bell. - Randy Marsh
2021-06-01 11:10:08,stocks,"what a shitty day. motherfuckin algos went on a selling spree.

I made a few hundred profit in AMD though."
2021-06-01 17:34:24,stocks,What's the merger?
2021-06-01 14:14:56,stocks,OPEC+ guidance was better-than-expected pent up demand and continued output cuts.
2021-06-01 14:45:22,stocks,"It was announced Friday:

Market already reacted to the news."
2021-06-01 15:21:55,stocks,"That's worth like $10 billion in valuation, right?"
2021-06-01 16:33:35,stocks,Bag holding while larping is a unique experience.
2021-06-01 15:05:38,stocks,prrrrryyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyced iNNNN
2021-06-01 15:11:50,stocks,"From 2009 to 2011 there was constant talk of a market correction because many people thought the underlying economics just hadn't rebounded enough post 2008 to justify valuations. Never happened. 

So often the way a lot of people ""feel"" isn't really relevant."
2021-06-01 14:53:03,stocks,qqq up 1.5% from mid Jan levels - we are now 6 months into the year. Not exactly been ripping non stop!
2021-06-01 14:48:10,stocks,"Eventually there will be one, but it’s impossible to predict the timing of it. Just try to be invested in solid companies at decent prices and weather the storm."
2021-06-01 14:54:19,stocks,Do you mean apart from the growth correction since February?
2021-06-01 14:51:01,stocks,Wasn't the DOW losing 600 points and the three big red days a couple weeks ago that breather the market needed?
2021-06-01 16:31:11,stocks,"on one hand, I agree. But on the other, I am starting to get the feeling that we'll rather just be trading sideways for a year. My gains with primarily S&P 500 over the last couple months is about 6% which is nearing a typical year as it is. With the Fed showing no signs of raising rates and the economy recovering, I am thinking we'd need a new catalyst to spur panic selling of crash levels"
2021-06-01 15:00:14,stocks,[deleted]
2021-06-01 14:57:47,stocks,no
2021-06-01 10:38:43,stocks,Always was the play
2021-06-01 13:09:08,stocks,you know there's a reason they banned the ticker... to keep the discussion in the meme thread.
2021-06-01 14:00:56,stocks,"BB is only running because AMC and GME are back to making big moves after significant price suppression. Once the hype phase is over for these two, expect BB to make the same kind of downfall as it did previously as nothing has fundamentally changed about the company to cause this rise."
2021-06-01 14:19:04,stocks,I never bought BB but it should be back to single digits at any moment
2021-06-01 10:23:57,stocks,It’s mostly bad for growth stocks due to a rising discount rate for future cashflows.
2021-06-01 10:25:37,stocks,"It's not that they're afraid of stocks so much as stocks lose some of their value proposition when compared against things like bonds.

At its core, valuation models are about backtracking profits from a future date to today's date.

Let's say you invest 100 bucks in Square. Their forward looking guidance says they want it so they can earn more \~5-7 years from now. Your $100 is buying you a seat to eat a piece of that earnings' future. However it's a small piece, obviously, at that shareprice. And it works out to a $101 piece of that future earnings is a 100 dollars today. The yield is less than 1%.

You won't get that dollar back as a dollar. Square says they'll invest it in growth when that day comes, which is great, but their p/e is sky high and it just is what it is. However, the U.S. government says it'll do the same but net a bit more -- depending on what time frame we're talking about. Right now the 10 Year gets you a bit less than 1.7%. Also it'll just give it back to you as straight cash.

It's not exactly a 1-for-1 comparison but no matter how you slice it the question becomes: why in the world would anyone buy Square? Or any of these stocks? Assuming we're not actually apes.

What ends up happening for a lot of these stocks is that you're essentially just gambling, or making a not-so-educated guess, that either Square is wrong about their own guidance or there's enough price momentum that you get back your investment earlier. However, for a lot of institutional investors, you can't go back to your boss with that."
2021-06-01 11:11:14,stocks,"US is not a manufacturing superpower anymore. Prices are surging in commodities so prices from grocery stores will just keep getting higher. When people are worrying about the surging grocery prices, they will cut back all the non essential spending to make sure they are well prepared for the surging prices in the future. This administration's policies are fueling inflation as well. Tax hike and tax credits basically means there is close to impossible for US to expand domestic supply chain as both cost from taxes and labor will go way up. To cope with all these artificial demand, US will be paying foreign countries that have a robust manufacturing industry to import daily essentials.

Bull market won't end as long as this administration is spending recklessly. What biden wants to do is basically free money for many foreign countries. The bull market won't end but will turn to foreign countries that have a stable and robust supply chain, commodities, housing and likely coins. Some other US stocks that focus on supply chain might benefit as well but certainly not the overall US market. These policies are putting US into massive recession risk in the coming years."
2021-06-01 11:15:21,stocks,"In moderation it's a great thing, but in excess it's bad, because it means everything increases in prices, including the costs as well, esp for growth companies, that may already be running on minimal profit margins. 

Say you run a burger joint, then your supplier increases the prices of burger buns, you have to raise the price of your burgers, but sometimes the cost of prices increases greater than the price you sell your burgers, thus you now make less money. Rising interest rates, will just make it even more difficult, especially since many growth companies may be running on a loan. Additionally, if it gets too expensive, less customers may buy as well. It's much easier for customers to just stop buying burgers or start making their own, than it is for businesses to just walk away, unless they want to close business all together, esp during economic downturns, thus it impacts businesses, but esp really smaller growth companies."
2021-06-01 10:22:23,stocks,Dying
2021-06-01 10:51:31,stocks,It's at ATH.
2021-06-01 10:48:58,stocks,Half and half
2021-06-01 11:33:34,stocks,Neither. I hold amd but current entry point is not great.
2021-06-01 11:23:08,stocks,Both
2021-06-01 12:55:45,stocks,"Both are pretty expensive right now IMO, but if you’re long-term investing then go for it"
2021-06-01 17:02:23,stocks,I knew I was forgetting to buy some shares from somewhere! CCL is going to grow drastically come this second half of the year!
2021-06-01 08:58:15,stocks,Debt.
2021-06-01 13:14:09,stocks,"Check out AWAY. I don’t hold, but considering."
2021-06-01 09:49:29,stocks,I feel more worried about value valutation then growth atm which is weird.
2021-06-01 12:58:03,stocks,Thats really not whats happening right now.
2021-06-01 11:09:58,stocks,"nope

the proxies for that have reversed too today outside of energy even if they don't give up their gains entirely (which are, besides sector specifics, the Dow, RSP, and SPYV)."
2021-06-01 12:05:18,stocks,"Why is their ceo an ass?

Also, oatly is more overvalued in that space fwiw"
2021-06-01 12:02:26,stocks,Their meat is also ass.
2021-06-01 13:13:15,stocks,"Their stock consistently does extreme ups and extreme down. It’s coming off a down so I’m hoping for a good return, regardless of today’s drop."
2021-06-01 10:41:18,stocks,What happened?
2021-06-01 10:44:53,stocks,Holy shit! Their price plummeted. I’m still getting a burrito today.
2021-06-01 11:12:18,stocks,Are you talking about the new drag lunch?
2021-06-01 18:33:14,stocks,Why is everyone here obsessed with wsb ?
2021-06-01 14:17:08,stocks,Let's see you portfolio from today in 3 months.
2021-06-01 14:33:12,stocks,">edit: told y’all despite the downvotes keep em coming

The sector is a mixed bag at best.  Overall, the top 50 over $10 a share, is still down for the day."
2021-06-01 10:36:05,stocks,Loooks like just nother flat day to me.
2021-06-01 09:57:09,stocks,"Take profits. For the past two days it goes up in pre market, and then declines through out the day. I don’t see this getting any “higher” stable wise than $31."
2021-06-01 10:31:16,stocks,"Bro, it's a gambling stock with absolutely no fundamentals to it at all.  Trying to set a price target is like trying to catch a greasy pig or herd 10 kittens.  Take your money, feel lucky about it, and then invest in things worth your time and money."
2021-06-01 09:54:05,stocks,"always take profits, this shit is too volatile to fuck around with."
2021-06-01 13:07:42,stocks,"Love the product, but it’s grossly overvalued. The burrito business is not worth the premium they’re selling at.

Edit: my current indigestion from Chipotle may leave me biased, but I stand by my statement"
2021-06-01 13:04:35,stocks,what do you mean
2021-06-01 13:06:27,stocks,They’re just waiting for you to dip your toes in the market so they can snatch it up from right under you.
2021-06-01 12:03:03,stocks,"Ideally you buy at the bottom of a market crash, right now is very volatile."
2021-06-01 12:05:48,stocks,Usually leveraged are for day or swing traders. I wouldn't want to hold 3x anything long term with almost 1% fee.
2021-06-01 12:30:23,stocks,"forever, or at least until the trend breaks (200 day moving average of qqq)"

2021-06-01 08:27:40,stocks,Dude I haven’t made any money playing non meme stocks. I don’t even know anymore.
2021-06-01 18:49:46,stocks,I regret that I have but one downvote to give
2021-06-01 06:06:02,stocks,Huh? You want them to be sold for 5k a card or something? Then they would be handing the market to scalpers and miners. Would be the worst thing they could do. If they want to be greedy and ruin their reputation then sure.
2021-06-01 06:01:10,stocks,"They are selling their cards at the price they should be going for. Nvidia is supposed to jack up their retail price because scalpers are screwing up the market? Problem 1 are the scalpers, and problem 2 are the idiots buying from the scalpers."
2021-06-01 14:22:49,stocks,It's always the same. Some event is supposed to be the big bomb that triggers the MOASS. Then when nothing significant happens some *other* thing becomes the big event. Not a cult btw.
2021-06-01 14:35:59,stocks,"GME and AMC are the financial equivalent of being a Jim Jones follower.

Just make sure to get out before the kool-aid party."
2021-06-01 14:18:24,stocks,"Means they'll find another excuse for why it didn't happen this time, and eventually find some other date for when it will happen, or in lieu of that say that the companies have still got good long-term fundamentals.

It's been playing out like this for months.  You can make some money and have some fun with it, just like you can in a casino, but that's about it."
2021-06-01 11:42:13,stocks,"VT for world exposure

VOO for S&P

2021-06-01 12:00:21,stocks,"You should not bet everything on the US imo.

2021-06-01 17:50:54,stocks,Thanks! It's been an odd year
2021-06-01 17:50:01,stocks,I've rejoiced and I've despaired over and over without taking any action in that area. Back to the boring shit I go
2021-06-01 12:14:05,stocks,"Probably will be correct but too early...lately the trend has been for tech earnings to get front ran, and I'm starting to no longer expect anything in this world until that begins to get close.

Not everything has to be similar but IF this is the case, do not expect anything until late June."
2021-06-01 12:24:00,stocks,I don’t think that’s gonna happen. Plus their bread and butter is AWS.
2021-06-01 12:11:36,stocks,I rarely use Amazon anymore. It is either extremely cheap Chinese crap or counterfeits.
2021-06-01 15:56:32,stocks,And Google and Amazon

2021-06-01 15:22:59,stocks,Thanks for the suggestion. I'm doing this with PLTR. I finally went above cost basis last week.

Since when do Logitech make SSDs, RAM, cases, liquid coolers, fans, RGB platforms, PSUs and prebuilt gaming PCs?

Personally I own a little stock in both companies for what it's worth, but they only really have competitive overlap within the accessories arena - that is the much smaller part of Corsair's business and the vast majority of Logitech's."
2021-06-01 16:10:29,stocks,JD has never been in the CCP's crosshairs and appear to be actively avoid being so.

2021-06-01 10:45:47,stocks,"Yeah the brand is getting big, tons of girls in their 20s and 30s especially absolutely love it, and it's in Starbucks now."

Chobani is known for their yogurt and that's their big selling product, that's where their high valuation comes from.  They give competition but Oatley still dominates, and is now in Starbucks and lots of coffee shops."
2021-06-01 18:06:41,stocks,I’m getting out as soon as I can. It’s clear that it’s getting caught up in some pump and dump. Investors don’t seem to optimistic about the stock itself. I’d love to break even but I doubt it’ll get that far

2021-06-01 10:02:04,stocks,😂
2021-06-01 18:20:00,stocks,Long term definitely. Short term I think it can make a run- it was $100 a share not that long ago. But I guess we will see how it goes. Already in for $40k worth. I will ride it out as long as I need to.
2021-06-01 14:04:21,stocks,"Haha we shall see, I plan on holding my 300 shares for a while."
2021-06-01 12:20:51,stocks,"Lol I don’t know why this didn’t cross my mind. I may consider, just don’t want my purchase price to increase too much"

I just got more conviction in BABA at current prices, thats why I got no JD, but maybe I add them for some BABA, if BABA makes a good bounce."
2021-06-01 09:38:11,stocks,JD looks great to me. really good value for a growth stock IMO. I must not be seeing something for market to not push it up higher
2021-06-01 10:58:06,stocks,"Gave up some gains, look at the 1Y chart, still a very good buy right now, BABA is my only Chinese stock in the red btw, so you are still buying better than me if that helps you."
2021-06-01 15:33:05,stocks,Bought it at a low when their vaccine was denied by the CDC and only up 5% since then.

The thing is that from 2010 there were a massive growth.. and it would be to easy to say: it will go further like that."
2021-06-01 07:53:56,stocks,"This kind of funds have an average return of almost 10%, which is pretty good imo. 
I'm skeptical because I think that this will not happen in the future.. It would be too good and easy to be true...

An example:  VTI was stagnant between 2001 and 2011. That means 10 years without any kind of return! 
In the last years such funds made good returns and that's why people are using the ""10% return"" statement as marketing to sell this kind ETF... 

I have the feeling that if I start now I will withdraw the same amount of money in 30 years.

Again: those are just feelings.."

2021-06-01 14:55:25,stocks,We've never seen a recovery from a crash happen as fast as after covid. The government has been just pumping money into the economy like it's monopoly money. Feels propped up artificially.

2021-06-01 14:56:10,stocks,"Yes, absolutely. Everyone is ignoring how bad inflation is right now."
2021-06-01 15:39:30,stocks,"I'm wondering how growth stocks will react and where they will be if another correction occurs.

1: if it happens soon, expect another trough and buying opportunity and people people holding growth stock bags even longer. 

2: If it happens later, perhaps growth stocks will have recovered and it will also be another buying opportunity.

1: (pure speculation): nio rebounds to 42-45 (hell already there), then gets slammed back down to low thirties or upper twenties. 

2: nio rebounds full to 55-60, then gets slammed down, but only to the upper thirties."
2021-06-01 14:54:04,stocks,Maybe. I feel like the recovery after covid was super quick and artificial. Now we have inflation like crazy. Many stocks are overvalued like crazy. I think the government was just giving out massive amounts of money and people pumped it into the stock market. It doesn't feel natural.

I don't care about it crushing earnings estimates either, until stocks viewed as COVID plays stop getting stomped on, the STOCK of Zoom is likely to stay in the downtrend it's been in for several months now.

Although looky there, you complained too early. It's up now in the after hours (that doesn't change my opinion though, this stock will remain in a medium term downtrend until they are finished crushing COVID plays, even if it's up tomorrow).

The pandemic really separated between the haves and the have nots.  The already well-off people came out of it with more savings and less debt.  There are a lot of money that is going to be spent once everything opens up.  The companies that survived came out leaner and more efficient.  They trimmed their fat.

Knowing they have pent up demand means they can work on increasing supply, and lowering economies of scale, although they're probably reached a good medium for that a long time ago.

I don't really care who gets a graphics card as long as they get sold and NVDA makes money on it. Which is exactly what's happening. I would not want them to jack up the price to make some short term revenue, and then abandon all their loyal customers who right now, could easily switch to AMD and get similar performance.

Just ignore it and track your cost basis on a separate sheet of paper or a spreadsheet or something.  Wash rule only matters if you take a loss and want to deduct the loss.

I'm building up my VTI to be my stable rock, and start to choose other single stock picks later this year. Looking at building positions in AAPL, COST, and BMO.TO"
2021-06-01 17:28:34,stocks,"QFIN - 38.06%: A Chinese payment connections service with an enormous addressable market, QFIN is by far my favorite stock at the moment. It’s borderline impossible to find a company with margins, ROE, ROCE, and historical earnings CAGRs this high, let alone at a P/E this low (7.2 at its current price). They have a strong brand, the business model is highly scalable, management appears competent, transparent, and experienced, and they performed far better than their competitors during the pandemic, with lower delinquency rates and a lesser earnings loss. They’ve done an incredible job of expanding into new revenue streams and maximizing capital efficiency. I could sing this company’s praises all day long, but suffice to say I’m already up ~80% and plan to ride it higher.

HIFS - 18.50%: This is my newest position, and at the moment my only loser (although it feels unfair to call it a loser after a drop of under 1% in the mere month or so that I’ve owned it). HIFS is a family-operated, regional S&L that operates in the Boston area (with an expansion to D.C. in the works), pursues extremely safe lending practices (loan losses are consistently well below the industry average, and were barely significant even during the Global Financial Crisis), and is by far the most capitally efficient bank I’ve ever seen. Its core net profit margins are well over 40%, and GAAP net profit margins are sitting at 58.7% for the past year. That would be insanely high for even a software company, let alone a bank. The bank’s owner-operators are practically obsessive about cost-cutting to the point where management recently announced that they would no longer issue press releases for the declaration of dividends, instead communicating that through quarterly and annual reports. Why? To cut costs. How many corporate management teams would even think to do that? There are very few certainties in the stock market, but I know of at least one: if you invest in HIFS, your money will be managed responsibly and with the goal of getting the absolute most out of every dollar.

BRK.B - 18.13%: Berkshire Hathaway needs no introduction. Investing in BRK is essentially allowing your money to be managed by the most successful investor in human history. Many think Buffett is “past his prime”, but at the very least, you can trust him to act rationally and with the best interests of his shareholders in mind. It also doesn’t hurt that Berkshire gives me indirect exposure to some of the best businesses on the planet.

INTC - 11.55%: Intel has faced significant criticism in the past for a failure to innovate and stay ahead of technology trends. This is somewhat true. Multiple generations of Intel management sat on their hands as AMD, TSM, and Arm gained significant ground on the technology front. That being said, I believe wholeheartedly in Pat Gelsinger (the new CEO) and his vision for Intel. He has his fair share of critics, but he has at the very least revitalized the company. Whether he is leading them down the right path or not remains to be seen, but he is at least leading them somewhere. The financials still look great, and INTC has the resources to annihilate their competitors so long as they execute well. Mobileye is also a very promising AV subsidiary, and could prove to be the eventual market leader in AV software and hardware.

FL - 11.24%: Foot Locker, to me, exemplifies the term “durable competitive advantage”. There’s a couple of benchmarks I like to use to determine this. Firstly, if the company has sold the same product for the past decade, and is likely to do so for the next decade, it probably has a durable business model. Foot Locker sells shoes. They’ve sold shoes for their entire existence. People will always need shoes. That’s a durable business model. Secondly, to determine brand strength: if you can picture their brand in your head without having to look it up, that’s a strong brand. Everyone knows Foot Locker’s brand. You know the employees’ referee-style uniforms, and the logo with the red lettering and a silhouette of one of those referees. Lastly, think about how much it would cost to effectively compete with the company. Foot Locker has a workforce of about 50,000 employees operating over 3,000 brick-and-mortar stores, not to mention a distribution network to support their e-commerce segment. This translates to repeating operating expenses of about $2.5 billion annually, not including what’s sure to have been countless one-time expenses Foot Locker had to deal with while building this empire, or the amount of time it took to build the brand recognition and brand loyalty it possesses. All of this just to eek out profit margins of about 6.5% on average. No start-up will ever be capable of effectively disrupting or competing with a company like that. They had their fair share of struggles from the pandemic, but responded extremely well and are now back to (and above) pre-pandemic levels of profitability.

UNM - 2.52%: UNM is my oldest position on this list, and was at one point my largest. It hasn’t exactly fallen out of favor with me, but I’ve obviously found some buying opportunities that I liked more. That being said, it still has a place in my portfolio as a defensive position and a deep value play. Life and disability insurance is a very stable business, especially when you have a balance sheet as strong and a management team as cautious as UNM’s. The dividend is nice (and was recently raised), and share buybacks are set to resume in H2 2021.

This portfolio is focused primarily on the quality of the underlying businesses, with a secondary focus on value. Dividend income is low, but the primarily goal for me at this stage is capital appreciation. I may be somewhat under-diversified in the eyes of some, but I believe what I lack in diversification is made up for in certitude. Any input would be appreciated :)"

I transitioned my portfolio into the Uranium Sector around February and I'm sitting on a gain of around 41%. Would definitely recommend giving the sector a look if you're interested. It's volatile, but due to the sector being small and companies not releasing a ton of information, it's very possible to do some DD and catch wind of news before others do, which can lead to some pretty good opportunities.

I closed my CCJ position and reinvested it into FDCFF, since CCJ has been lagging a bit to much for me and FDCFF has had pretty good lake results plus the campaign coming up."

2021-06-01 06:46:24,stocks,Some neoliberals make the argument that scalping is good due to the fact that it is the perfect example of supply vs demand :)!
2021-06-01 16:46:51,stocks,It all depends on how close the retail price is to the market price. The market price is literally the point at which the quantity supplied and demanded are equal (ie. if the price were higher than that there would be a surplus).
2021-06-01 08:57:05,stocks,It is a good example of supply and demand. But the invisible hand of the market can get fucked
2021-06-01 12:59:32,stocks,It's actually a symptom of inefficient market.

2021-06-01 17:47:43,stocks,"Good Question, Would love to answer. It has not been an easy ride.

I had like 5yr work exp back in 2016. Not much of savings too. I was paperhands. Was new to the stock market.

Started with $1000 bucks, bought at $3 sold at $5, Again bought at $7 and sold at $9. Was always afraid to not lose money ( Pretty much all of us go through this phase). Also I realized that 'Quantity' plays an important role in your profit. Higher the quantity, Higher the profit (So is the risk, But risk can be minimized if company has rock solid products, roadmap and is reducing debt, posting good profits)

Then I saved bit of money for few months praying AMD should not rise too much. Took margin, Added some money from my wife's account. Finally bought $55K worth of AMD in 2017. I kind of bought in batches spread across few months (1000, 2500,1000 kind of). I was barely left with $2-$3K in my bank account after the purchse.

BAM, I bought at $14 in 2017 and then AMD got stuck between $10 to $15 whole of 2017-18. Yes one whole f**ing year it was in the same range (Just like it is now). My wife was questioning my decisions, I started questioning my own decisions.

I used to wake up every morning and check my AMD portfolio. At one time I was in red with $14K in negative. I just held on because the company was posting good results.

2019 and 2020 were good for AMD. 2021 could be like 2017 where AMD stayed in same range.

I have paseed the test. 2017-18 were gruesome years for me.

PS: Also own 9100 NIO @ $9 and 3650 PLTR @ $18. I still have the habbit of checking my portfolio every 1 hr. I am not able to get rid of it. AMD got me that habbit."

For example during an accident you would want to disconnect the main battery to prevent any chance of something shorting out and causing a huge fireball. You want something small which can independently power small systems which don't need to run on 375V."

A windshield sensor is inexpensive and accurate. Using a camera and parsing its output with a neural network requires a lot more processing power and returns a less accurate reading.

It’s a complicated way to ineffectively do a simple task that’s better accomplished with old technology."
2021-06-01 14:16:32,stocks,"I misread your question by the way: a regular sensor would just detect rain droplets and turn on accordingly. Neural networks interprets data through layers of nodes (neurons) to form a conclusion about what exactly the data entails (for example: recognizing handwritten numbers based on generalization of outcomes of a predefined trainset, and reapplying to brand new input). This is what is referred to as “training a model” in which the computer determines what links between nodes should carry what cost factor. This is what i ment with y=1/0, it can be anything in between 0 and 1, in which y depicts nodes of outcome. Back to our example, in recognizing handwritten numbers, you’d have 10 nodes (0:9), which is implicit for the outcome of the model. Say, 0 gets assigned a y of .87, the model would output 0 as most likely.

In conclusion, the neural network would be better at predicting the ideal settings for your tesla"
2021-06-01 14:33:51,stocks,"But if they have cameras in the car already, having them detect rain has to be cheaper and use less energy than adding a dedicated sensor to do so.  I'm not commenting on how well that works, just that no additional sensor is likely less power.  I think the cameras are always on and the system is always doing something anyway."

If there is water on the glass, the infrared light is reflected back. Rain detected. The amount of power it takes to operate is negligible, as the cost of the sensor.

On the other hand, from Electrek:

>	Tesla has now started deploying a new software update (v2019.40.1.1) with this new neural net. The automaker wrote in the release notes:

>	“Automatic wipers have been improved to be more likely to activate when it is lightly raining and respond to changes in rain intensity for more environments. The automatic wipers are now employing the first production deep neural network trained with over 1 million images for the detection of water droplets in a windshield and additional weather cues.”

For example, after collecting my driving data for weeks/days, the computer will know what my prefer wiping speed is for a certain rain condition (how hard is the rain), it will fine tune its algorithms to fit my need better (less manual overwrite on my part).  It's the same thing about controlling volume vs speed in the audio system for some luxury auto.

Here's the deal, all AI will be worse than simple manual/semi automatic setup until it gets to know the driver better (or collecting more data).  Just like the Nest themo stat - it's a pain to use when first install but over time, it learns your schedule and does a better job.

If we assume 200W at peak gaming use, the Model S should be able to run an Xbox for about 500 hours.

I don't actually know anything about Telsa batteries, and I assume in real life you wouldn't get the full 100 kWh, but even if you cut that in half to 250 hours of Xbox use, you're still not making much of a dent with a couple hours of gameplay."

There needs to be major mathematical level breakthroughs before deep learning can solve the problem, just throwing more data isn't going to work. 
That's not to say some genius won't make that breakthrough tomorrow and suddenly reposition Tesla at the top but that's not a guarantee. And as of now it's why they fail to make top 10 lists in best SD tech."

Tesla’s approach is instead of lessons just chucking everyone’s kids in the deep end and telling the parents the kids can sort of already swim, but to also keep an eye on them.

I have been trying to find the right balance of dividends and capital gains in a portfolio. I came up with 5 tickers ranging from high yield with poor performance to low yield with strong performance. Would love to hear what you all think. My current account yields 2.5% so this will increase it 2x which I’m happy about.

VTI 25% - Dividend 1.25%, 5yr Change 102%

QYLD 25% - Dividend 11.89%, 5yr Change 1.4%

DIVO 20% - Dividend 5.36%, 5yr Change 43.43%

BSTZ 15% - Dividend 5.41%, Change since inception 81.4%

SCHD 15% - Dividend 2.69%, 5yr Change 88.7%

This gives an overall dividend yield of 5.57%. Together the 5 tickers have had an average return of 60% for share price in the last 5 years. The exception is BSTZ which hasn’t been around for 5 years yet."

More often than not, these heavy dividend paying stocks underperform the market and don't even hold up that well in a market crash."
2021-06-01 03:31:55,stocks,"Right balance of dividends and capital gains in a portfolio is dependent on investment goals.

My thoughts are VT rather than VTI, for international exposure and when combined with SCHD there’s respectable US coverage. I won’t consider QYLD until I’m using the acct for regular income - lack of growth and downward trend keeps me away."
2021-06-01 10:25:35,stocks,I have been watching QYLD and I am not sold on it. In downturn it participates around 80%. In up market it is flat if not a little down. I wouldn’t put 25% in it.

2021-06-01 11:45:35,stocks,"I personally like having 2 sources of revenue with dividends and capital gains. There’s no guarantee for growth stocks so it’s good to have an additional source of revenue. Yes, high yield dividend payers do not perform well for share price so people going after 10%+ dividend yields are typically living off of the dividend payments and not concerned with share price.

It’s not like growth is guaranteed so it’s nice to have a backup. I also see dividend payments as a big benefit. The only way to access profits from capital growth investments is to sell shares so I like that dividends are paid out in cash without affecting your positions. You can then choose to reinvest or use it as income so I see a lot of benefit there. Like you said it depends on the individual’s goals; I like having a good balance of both capital gains and dividend income."
2021-06-01 14:10:41,stocks,"So far I haven’t seen much haha. It seems like when it comes to capital gains vs dividends people are on one side or the other. I like to have a balance of both. From my point of view you can find low yield dividend holdings from 0-2% that have strong growth performance and you can find high yield dividends 7%-10%+ that either trade sideways or slightly negative over time. I want to capture both so I aim for a 5% total dividend payout along with strong performance which is why I chose this blend. Also, I agree VT and VTI are easily interchangeable. Looking at VT again it looks like it’s actually had higher percentage change in price the last 5 years compared to VTI and it’s nice that it’s half the price."
2021-06-01 11:51:48,stocks,"I was hesitant for a long time. I’m more so looking at the blend of the portfolio. QYLD essentially is a dividend booster and adds nothing in terms of share price performance. However, the other 75% of the portfolio has decent growth over time which makes up for it. So overall the portfolio gives strong dividends and growth. If QYLD was constantly going lower I wouldn’t add it but performing flat or slightly down is fine since the other ones will make up for it in terms of growth."
2021-06-01 11:58:30,stocks,I had some REITs in the past as dividend boosters but QYLD beats them for yield. I only need one high yield holding so I went with QYLD; REML isn’t a bad option either. If it can return to pre-covid levels you would get capital gains from it too.
2021-06-01 16:55:00,stocks,Yes growth will be greater than dividends. I like having a mix of both though. I like having two revenue streams instead of one especially since growth is not always guaranteed. I also see value in receiving payments. The only way to access profit from growth holdings is to sell shares. Dividends pay cash without affecting your positions and I see a lot of value in that
2021-06-01 17:27:08,stocks,"I incorporate some dividend funds for different reasons. In the retirement account it’s tax deferred ‘income’ that compounds the overall position. 

In my buy and hold account funds like SCHD can perform similar to VOO or SPY, and DRIP means that even in unforeseen events (job loss, etc) contributions are still being made. 

In my margin trading account I keep some promising dividend funds as shorter term buy and holds that ultimately increase my buying power for writing contracts - sometimes against those same dividend funds, effectively ‘double dipping’.

I’m considering moving some savings over to something like JEPI and/or QYLD to simulate a high-yield savings account.

Dividend funds certainly aren’t a magic bullet, but they help me maintain an overall dynamic investing strategy."
2021-06-01 15:13:19,stocks,"Are you planning on using this fund for income? Your title uses “income”, but you can have a dividend portfolio without any immediate intention for income.

I’m not planning on the income any time soon so I stay away from funds like QYLD and DIVO. They maintain well during major corrections or crashes, but otherwise fail to perform (even including dividends) as well as others like SCHD, VOO, or VT.

In mine, I have a much higher allocation of SCHD - growth and all. In a different and tax deferred account I focus on higher yield funds like REITs, etc"
2021-06-01 17:07:01,stocks,"True! For my case, I only care about the revenue stream 30+ years down the road so I'd prefer the business I am invested in to reinvest it back into it's own entity."
2021-06-01 00:00:00,stocks,"Investments in blue chip stocks. Advice requested and discussion. Should I stop day trading and just invest long term in etfs? I am a new investor in the stock market. I max out my 401k and after that, I have a good amount of money that goes to my bank and just lays there. 2 weeks ago, I started investing a lump sum amount using a Fidelity Brokerage account. I have been trying to day trade with stocks that are not meant for day trading - AAPL, GOOG, VOO, VOOG, AMZN, MSFT and BKSA. However, due to movement in the market, I have been able to earn some amount of money which makes me really happy. Although I know that the market is completely random and I may lose money any day. The reason why I invest in these particular stocks is because I kind of believe in the companies and I use them in my everyday life.

Last week I bought AAPL stocks. Currently, AAPL has gone down. I have been really worried due to that. On Friday, newstreet reduced their Apple rating to Sell saying that the price target of AAPL is now 90$. if AAPL goes to 90$, I will suffer a huge amount of loss and I am scared of that. I am not sure how the ratings of these investment agencies affect the stock price but AAPL reduced a lot on Friday. As I am new to the market, I am not sure what to do and asking from advice for seasoned individuals over here. Should I sell my AAPL stock at a loss and just invest somewhere else? ( I will have around 100$ loss). I asked some friends and everyone is saying - Hold. Its Apple. Still I wanted to ask. Thank you so much."

2021-05-31 23:51:31,stocks,"First, don't pay attention to analyst price targets.  Any one company's target is meaningless.  Go to [CNN Business](https://www.cnn.com/business).  Put in AAPL, then go to the ""Forecasts"" tab.  What you'll see is the high, median, and low analyst forecast.  $90 is the lowest one.  The median - that's the most common value - is $160.  The high is $185.   If you look on the left you'll see that these are Hi/Med/low drawing from the forecasts of 40 analysts.  That's a large sample.  

So, you see lots of analysts have a much higher target.  BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN ANY OF THIS WILL COME TRUE.  OK?  They're just guesses.  

Now I'm going to explain to you the proper basics of charts.  OK?  Go to [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/).  Enter AAPL.  Go to Full Screen.  Set the chart to ""max"".  Go to ""settings"" in the upper right.  Change the Y-axis scale to Logarithmic.  It's a pain but try to rescale the chart so it shows the last 10 years.  OK.  Find the draw tool in the upper right of hte chart.

Draw a line connecting all the lows after 2012.  Then draw another line connecting all the highs after 2012.  The band defined by the two lines is APPLs long term growth trend and trading range.  You can see the current price is \*\*\*way\*\*\* above the long term trading range.  

Now, if you look at the recent and future earnings, you'll see that APPL's earning look kind of like it's price chart - long term trend of steady growth, then rapid growth during the pandemic.  But if you look at the future earnings projections by those same 40 analysts, you'll see that the \*future\* earnings are projected to grow much more slowly than earnings grew during the pandemic.  And \*that\* my friend, is probably why some analysts have a low price target - they predict that slowing growth is going to hold back the stock price.  

My personal opinion is that the short term prospect for the stock is on the low side of the range on Yahoo.  The long term prospect for AAPL is sound as always.  

However, I don't know how much you make, but $100 loss on a stock is like pennies.  If you're not willing to risk $100, don't buy stocks.  

So I can't tell you whether you should buy or sell.  I would not \*buy\* AAPL at the current price.  But selling it to save a $100 is hardly worth the bother in my opinion.  That's ice cream and bubble gum money."
2021-05-31 23:30:16,stocks,"If you're having fun with day trading something like AMZN while also making a bit, then more power to you.  There's very little risk if you're also willing to hold longish-term (the current price is way below the average analyst low which is ~$3,800).

AMZN is my largest position and the only reason I don't mess around with 'day trading' it is that I fear missing out on the day when it finally breaks out of the ruts and starts running (that can happen at almost anytime see GOOG/GOOGL for instance). 

'#BringOnTheSplit ;)'"
2021-06-01 00:02:21,stocks,"The way I see it, you’ll always have that what-if FOMO when it comes to day trading unless you prove to yourself that it actually won’t work. Take some play money, 5-10% of your portfolio, and trade with it for a decent amount of time, a year or two. Carefully track performance, use a spreadsheet. At the end of the experiment, see how you did. If you made money, great. If you made more profit % than your investments, even better. Ideally this would be the case since you spend much more time on your trades day-to-day. If you’re losing money, now you know, and if you continue to trade, you can at least say with evidence that it’s because you find it fun, not because you think it’s profitable. And that’s okay too"
2021-06-01 07:19:35,stocks,"Rule 1 of investing. Never invest money you aren't prepared to lose. ESPECIALLY day trading.

I can't sure with certainty, but it sounds like you may have done that, when you said ""I am really worried"". 

Sure, nobody wants to see their investment go down, ad a little worry is always part of it, but ""really worried"" leads me to believe you aren't following rule 1. 

Of course, I can't truly read your emotion over text, so if you feel okay about it, forget what I said. But I figured I should just let it be known.

Edit: to add to this. If you feel like you're worried too much, pull out. You may be at a 5% loss now, and see that as a had investment, but it's still a net gain over a potential 10% loss. 

Ad it all comes down to DYOR (do your own research). You can read what the analysts are saying, and what Redditors are saying, etc. But ultimately, if you want to make money investing, you need to make your own decisions, and that starts with research. 

Analysts and Redditors can be part of the research, but you should also pay attention to company announcements, earnings reports, dividend history (if applicable), etc. 

For example, I've been back and forth on buying AMD for the past little while. But just this morning I heard about their partnership with tesla, and I believe that could push AMD forward, and I just so happen to have a bit of extra cash right now, so I plan to buy a few shares, all based on my own research and opinion. It could backfire, but I made the decision on my own accord, and believe in it."

Like many have said you just can't take out more than you put in before retirement.

I have one that's about 6 years old. And one day, when the housing market crashes again, I plan on taking out a lot of it to purchase a home. Or at least put a large down payment. That might be years away, but I'm a patient person.

And as far as positions go, be diverse. You want growth but you also want to have some solid blue chips in there too. I prefer dividend stocks because it creates a snowball effect. I'll get $1,200 in dividends this year. So I look at it like I'm putting in $7,200 this year."

2021-05-31 21:15:54,stocks,Yes there can be a situation where there isn’t enough volume and you simply could not buy. But you’ll likely never come across this situation.
2021-05-31 21:15:36,stocks,Simple. Someone’s selling.
2021-06-01 00:29:40,stocks,Where on earth did you get this idea of there being “fake shares” lol
2021-05-31 21:09:12,stocks,https://smallbusiness.chron.com/stock-turnover-vs-volume-36868.html
2021-05-31 22:09:04,stocks,"There are companies called ""market makers"" who constantly hold shares of stock that can be purchased. They also buy them to hold and resell to the next buyer. They make money off the difference between the bid and ask prices (bid/ask spread). When you place an order through your broker, they purchase (or sell) the shares from (or to) one of these companies through one of the stock exchanges."
2021-05-31 21:47:42,stocks,"Just raise your bid. Somebody will be happy to sell you theirs for a few pennies more. That's how the market works prices go up and down to keep the buying and selling moving. There is no increase or issue of shares. The fixed amount of shares held by the people in the market is called the float. Sometimes more shares are issued in an offering. Or bought back, retired, by the company but not very often."
2021-05-31 23:25:32,stocks,"If you place a market order to buy one share and that order goes unfilled that would suggest that nobody has a sell order out there, no matter what the price. That’s pretty much impossible."
2021-05-31 21:10:27,stocks,"You're under the assumption that no one sells. Volume means how many times a share has been traded, so even if the volume is gigantic, the same share can be passed to multiple people several times because people are selling."
2021-06-01 02:20:26,stocks,"When it comes to buying you could always increase the price you are willing to pay. Someone will be willing to sell. For example, someone might be willing to sell their shares at 1 million (an extreme example but one nonetheless). Then, in such case, you’ll have to pay that if you really want the share. The real problem comes when you are trying to sell. If the company is looking like it will collapse at any moment you might not be able to find any buyer.   
As for volume, as I understand it, it means traded shares, but not necessarily the number of shares traded. For example, consider the case where I buy 10 shares @ 100, sell at 102, wait for a drop, and buy again to then sell it again in the day day. The volume here would be like 400 trades shares even though I would only need 100 shares at a time.  Hope that helps."
2021-06-01 02:26:58,stocks,"The stock keeps trading..
It's an auction there will always be shares but at a higher price"
2021-06-01 12:48:29,stocks,">How can I keep buying?

Because there’s always someone selling."
2021-05-31 21:22:51,stocks,While my friend this is called naked shorting!  I believe most stock have 30-50% more shares available than there float allow!  Be careful my friend there's going to be a massive correction coming soon. Put your extra money in gold and silver! PttP
2021-05-31 21:07:31,stocks,u ever heard of google?
2021-05-31 22:38:38,stocks,"You don’t want to use the absolute of “never”, but this would never happen. Someone owns the shares and as we all know “anything is for sale for the right price”. If you are looking to buy a stock, there will be a seller for the right price.

Remember, this is a market and operates as such with a buyer and seller on each end. In times of low liquidity, “Market Makers” will provide liquidity on either the buy or sell side(again, for the right price)."
2021-05-31 21:18:47,stocks,Any idea if it’s ever happened?
2021-05-31 21:18:17,stocks,"Since I’m engaged in this post and not wanting to switch to my browser, we often does it happen where someone wants to buy, but nobody is selling? Never?"
2021-05-31 21:10:00,stocks,Thank you!! Turnover was the keyword I needed!
2021-05-31 22:14:03,stocks,So there’s never a way to tell if you have legitimate shares or not?
2021-05-31 21:30:07,stocks,"Kind of why I’m putting myself out there to ask the question. I appreciate being able to post somewhere to ask!

A friend has been hounding me on some stocks I can’t mention here. I started researching and, I like the increases, but didn’t understand the volume and turnover piece. 

My kind is at a point, of these people apparently hold a bunch of nonexistent shares, with the volume I’m seeing, how are they not replacing them with “real” shares."
2021-05-31 21:08:45,stocks,Yep. Duck duck go too. Haven’t found a great answer that I can understand. Thank you for continuing my streak of striking out.
2021-05-31 21:19:53,stocks,"Rude man.  Google first, ask a community after.  That’s why Reddit exists… for give and take feedback."
2021-05-31 21:21:09,stocks,Not that I’ve experienced. I’m sure its happened to some extremely low volume company out there. Its happens often enough in options contracts - the inability to sell.
2021-05-31 21:47:19,stocks,"Yeah, all the time with penny stocks. You get a company that barely exists and the volume might be a thousand shares on a good day. A lot of them are probably going to disappear when the new FTC rules go into effect this fall."
2021-05-31 21:24:20,stocks,It's happening right now with multiple stocks
2021-05-31 21:31:31,stocks,"Never in the history of free markets in the world. Because someone can always make a profit and someone else who’s buying sees a potential to make profit in the future as well otherwise they wouldn’t buy. When sellers outweigh buyers, price should drop. When buyers outweigh sellers, price should go up."
2021-05-31 21:11:20,stocks,"Welcome, trade carefully, we are entering a period of possible stagnation."
2021-05-31 22:19:59,stocks,"Not exactly sure what you mean. If you purchase the shares through your broker, they buy them through the exchange and put them in your account, so you own them."
2021-05-31 21:17:33,stocks,alright to answer your question - they just run out. Then you can’t buy anymore. Just like you thought. At that point you sell them but no one can buy them since the supply ran out. Let me know if at any point a lightbulb goes off for you.
2021-05-31 21:25:11,stocks,"google *how do stocks work* 

How do stocks work? Companies sell shares in their business to raise money. ... Once a company's stock is on the market, it can be bought and sold among investors. If you decide to buy a stock, you'll often buy it not from the company itself, but from another investor who wants to sell the stock."
2021-05-31 21:49:22,stocks,"There’s a few meme stocks that are constantly pushed on me, but I’m more interested in the penny stocks as in, trying to find something I believe in and jump on it. I figure it’s better than buying lottery tickets. I hope!"
2021-05-31 23:58:44,stocks,What new rules? What if we own one of these stocks?
2021-06-01 00:39:19,stocks,I bet if you offered a million bucks a share you'd find a seller pretty quick.
2021-05-31 21:34:02,stocks,"I think I finally got the lightbulb!

So that’s the theory about, “HODL”. You have “real” shares (still not exactly sure how that’s certain) and when the people with the fake shares need to buy, you set the price of the shares you want to sell."
2021-05-31 21:17:06,stocks,"Thank you! Up until this year, I paid for others to manage my stocks. With all of the interest around stocks (recent for me), I wanted to learn more about what is being done with my money. 

I’m going to take a small percentage of what I normally give them and give it a go for myself. I’m preparing myself for this by saying, “I need to be okay if I lose this money but, need to be smart about trying to be aggressive with it.”

Truly appreciate the advice as I try to be a good lurker!"
2021-05-31 21:33:04,stocks,And by stagnation he means discounts for deep long term value
2021-05-31 22:32:53,stocks,"Just wondering if there’s a possibility that I buy a stock through XYX, how I would know if they are real or not. 

For example, if I use Fidelity, is there a zero chance I’m buying fake shares?"
2021-05-31 22:03:08,stocks,"Be very careful. Low volume cuts both ways. If it's hard to buy, it's equally hard to sell. Low price combined with low volume also makes for volatility. A stock can shoot up 500%, but you won't be able to realize the gain because nobody's buying."
2021-05-31 23:10:06,stocks,"Honest advice. You are trying to learn what they people that you paid to handle your money before are doing. Your best bet is to find profitable trades that you have a high confidence will earn you positive income over the long run.

The people that managed your money before did not do anything nearly as aggressive as you are describing. They had to play it from a conservative standpoint. That means no meme stocks, penny stocks, or high volatility stocks.

Can you produce returns that are much better than they did? Of course you can. But, you are the person who decides what your comfort level is, and you know what risk threshold with which you are comfortable. They don't have that luxury, they have to be erring on the side of preserving your wealth."
2021-06-01 00:31:20,stocks,Man I’m gonna be real honestly you obviously are not nearly knowledgeable enough to be trying to trade penny stocks. You need to buy an index fund and let it sit there.
2021-06-01 01:10:11,stocks,"As I understand it, starting in September if a company isn't up to date on their filings and disclosures, brokerages won't be able to list them for over the counter trading. Legitimate small cap companies should be unaffected, but a lot of dodgy or moribund companies that are targets for pump-and-dumps will become untradeable.

As to what will happen if you own shares in one of those companies, nobody knows, but it'll likely depend on what trading platform you use. Some might freeze your shares, others might liquidate them for you. E-trade at least has sent out notices about what's going on, so you should keep an eye out for notifications."
2021-06-01 17:07:06,stocks,2 weeks ago I had to wait 3 hours for a order of Gamestop to fill
2021-05-31 21:43:28,stocks,"With naked shorting the people that are buying non existent shares are completely at the mercy of people who actually own shares. If they don’t sell, they pretty much get to drive the price up to whatever they want simply because shorts HAVE to cover."
2021-05-31 21:19:26,stocks,you should keep paying for others to do it
2021-05-31 23:06:40,stocks,Get off WSB's and ignore those conspiracy theories
2021-05-31 22:42:14,stocks,Where did you get this idea of fake shares?
2021-05-31 23:15:19,stocks,"Any share you can purchase through your broker will be a legitimate share.

Fake shares, or synthetic shares, or legitimate shares all look the same to the long position holder, and there is not a practical difference for them.

Where it does make a difference is to the party who initially sold those shares, and whether they bought them legitimately, or were manufactured through option trickery, or were the result of naked short selling.

None of these situations affect the holder of the shares in a long position."
2021-05-31 22:50:39,stocks,"No, they aren't going to be fake shares. When a company goes public or raises equity capital, an investment bank underwrites the offering and issues X number of shares and they are traded through the exchanges indefinitely. These shares are controlled digitally by the brokerages so you can't really have someone counterfeiting and putting them into circulation. Similar to when a bank deposits/transfers money into your account, you know whatever is there is real.

Edit: As others have mentioned (and you may have seen idiots in other subs losing their minds over it), naked shorting is sort of like creating ""fake"" shares, but that's an entirely different issue. You would never have to worry about having fake shares in your brokerage account."
2021-06-01 16:23:27,stocks,Yikes. Ok good to know thanks.
2021-06-01 17:17:15,stocks,That's because your bid was low. If you had bid $10 you'd still be waiting.
2021-05-31 21:45:46,stocks,"Is there a way to know if you are buying real shares or not?

Just curious if I want to toss some money at this, if I can confirm if my shares are real."
2021-05-31 21:50:41,stocks,Based on the other responses this is genuinely the best advice here
2021-05-31 21:23:13,stocks,"Is there a point where it would be a decent idea to do it on my own? Like a hobby?

2021-05-31 22:18:57,stocks,There is no such thing as fake shares lol
2021-05-31 22:17:44,stocks,You’re shares are real because you’re buying SHARES. Naked shorting is saying to a buyer “yes I have the shares to sell you (cover) @ this price” when they really don’t therefore making them buy at whatever the current market price demands (covering)
2021-05-31 23:10:31,stocks,"There is no such thing as fake shares, if someone is naked shorting and fails to deliver the shares they sold the broker will deliver the shares to the buyer and go after whomever sold the shares to get those shares back"
2021-05-31 22:19:40,stocks,"- Also, options are contracts between buyer and seller. 
Shares are individual pieces of XYZ company @ XYZ price. 

Many consider options gambling and buying shares much more realistic for an investment portfolio."
2021-06-01 17:36:58,stocks,"Then either it was a sell order, or your broker didn't actually send the order to the market for 3 hours, in which case you need a better broker."

2021-05-31 20:21:23,stocks,We just had a crash last year. Crashes don’t happen often. Usually once every 10 years.
2021-05-31 20:10:21,stocks,Yes I suspect so
2021-05-31 20:29:14,stocks,Pretty sure this week we’ll have one

2021-05-31 21:09:55,stocks,Causation vs correlation etc i know i know.. but we haven’t had a crash since step-sister got stuck in the dryer. Maybe its nothing but just saying it could be propping the market up. As long as she’s stuck we print imo
2021-06-01 00:10:45,stocks,If the fed raises rates to fight this transitory inflation the mortgage lenders start creating whacky loans to make up for lost demand it will cause a crash and we are not that many years away from that. Maybe 2 or so for the whacky loans to take effect. We will have another housing crash. That will once again be our next crash
2021-05-31 20:38:31,stocks,"No crash is identical, we had one LAST YEAR, kind of funny the perma bears/those who lost out don't like to count last year as a market crash. 

Oh well, keep repeating it every day and one of you will be right EVENTUALLY."
2021-05-31 20:51:01,stocks,Of course and it probably won't be long now. They leaned nothing from 2008 and continued doing the same thing. Now with the covid Era protections and forbearance expiring a lot of mortgages are going to default. Just look at the feds  reverse repos going on the last few weeks. The most in history. Not a good sign.
2021-05-31 20:20:22,stocks,Black swan event like the dollar crashing causing hyperinflation. Unlikely though as the dollar is still the world’s reserve currency.
2021-05-31 20:25:21,stocks,Yes
2021-05-31 20:34:51,stocks,Yes.
2021-05-31 20:52:15,stocks,I’m more worried about a crash like 1987; 22% ish drop in one day.

2021-05-31 23:22:56,stocks,"We will have a bubble and a pop. When and how they happen are 100% based on sentiment. If you talk to enough people and repeat yourself often enough, you'll convince people that the market will tank, and that will be that. It will tank.

On the other hand, do the same thing with a positive outlook, and you'll extend gains for everyone. In short, it's a confidence game. 

The market will go up when people are confident, and it will go down when people are not confident. It happens on the macro scale for entire markets, and the micro scale for individual companies.

There really isn't any excuse for a market crash/recession/depression other than people lost faith."

2021-06-01 09:33:32,stocks,"Amusingly, if you were right, you'd actually be wrong. The stock market is a chaotic system, which makes it difficult to predict over long time scales, but even worse: it's a chaotic system of type 2, which means it responds to prediction.  

If we assume that there is a 100% chance that you are right, people would sell before 9am in order to avoid the crash, thereby causing the crash to happen before 9am, making you wrong. Even though you were right. This is a contradiction, and therefore it is not possible to predict the movements of the stock market with 100% certainty."

2021-06-01 05:11:41,stocks,"The lenders dont actually make money from holding loans. They cant hold many themselves and there is no point to it due to low returns. They resell them on the secondary market so they can generate more loan fees.

Aside from the government controlled vendors who will not accept non-prime loans, the secondary market is pretty weak right now. mREITs arent all that healthy right now and there is very little appetite for 30 year 3%-4% loans. Money is not in fixed income right now.

The problem right now is housing inflation due to low supply. If we dont raise rates, real estate will continue to inflate at a ridiculous rate."
2021-05-31 22:03:08,stocks,"Try telling them we were in a recession, as per the literal definition. “Nooo it wasn’t exactly!!” 🤣"

2021-06-01 04:57:46,stocks,"The same thing? People are buying homes with zero down and banks are doing no doc loans?

There will be a reckoning at the rent level but thats probably all. What you are seeing right now is a supply problem which is literally the opposite of what we had in 2008 where supply was not an issue and people were buying homes without actually occupying them. It was 100% speculation and anyone could get a loan, even a high schooler working part time minimum wage... cough...."
2021-05-31 22:06:05,stocks,You guys don't have a circuit limit to prevent a crash like this ???
2021-05-31 20:40:30,stocks,"Hehe, that one wasn't enough scary in the end"
2021-05-31 21:03:32,stocks,"The end has been near for many, many years now, and it will be near for many years to come. There's always something to be worried about in the market. If you continue to worry about that, you'll end up sitting on the sidelines while others make money. In the long run, you'll be completely fine if you throw your money into the S&P."
2021-05-31 23:57:23,stocks,"I enjoy the sentiment of this comment, but it’s not completely true. There’s always going to be events or  unknowns the average person can’t account for.

For example, 2008 stock market crash… don’t think confidence would have helped there. Anyone that held  investments in Bear Stearns can attest to that. Multiple companies were essentially pushing bad products, and once the floor dropped out confidence could not save them.

Similarly, last year… if the coronavirus had affected white collar workers more adversely (say, if remote working was not as easy as it is in this day and age) do you think the market would have bounced back as easily? I personally don’t.

As long as you’re long on solid companies (or better, ETFs), I do agree with that it’s not worth worrying about another crash. Especially if you’re not yet living off the money."
2021-06-01 17:09:23,stocks,I agree. The thing is that it is actually logical that the market gets ATH with time. I am only scared with the fact that ATH came so fast after covid crashes. It is really strange. I feel like people start bullying the market because of covid crashes
2021-05-31 22:28:56,stocks,When I buy
2021-06-01 11:02:53,stocks,Jupiter’s stock market is zero. GDP is 0 also. The only direction it’s economy can go is up. We should all be long.
2021-06-01 13:47:21,stocks,I promise you the market isn’t going to respond to this guy’s prediction. It’s completely possible that he could turn out to be right.
2021-06-01 08:31:54,stocks,But what time zone?
2021-05-31 23:12:46,stocks,Just because it recovered quickly doesnt mean the crash didnt happen.
2021-05-31 23:16:03,stocks,"There hasn't been a crash this year, if you consider Feb-April a crash, then you'd pretty much be saying we've have a crash every year.

Typically a crash would be 20% or greater draw down of the main index's from the highs, at which point we'd be in what's called a bear market"
2021-05-31 20:45:48,stocks,"I know that innovative tech has been absolutely destroyed since mid-February but even considering that...the flagship tech index in the end went down...what...11% from its ATH at the peak of that?

A correction, like September, but not even bear market type numbers. 

It's a crash and bear market in many fun names (which I have admitted). It's not an actual one though unless what they've done to the innovative names spreads, which it did in 2000 eventually, but hasn't (yet?) here."
2021-05-31 20:39:45,stocks,"I'm glad you'll be wrong, pretty shitty hoping for a crash when we're all almost getting back to normal. 

You're the type I'm happy to see lose."
2021-05-31 21:00:08,stocks,"If not late June, probably Early July. If not early July, latest will be early August, and if not by then, I'll find a reason to delay my prediction just a few more months into the future until I'm finally right. Then I'll sell a course telling people how they can do the same."
2021-05-31 21:07:46,stocks,I’m thinking early June 😆
2021-05-31 22:07:33,stocks,"We do, it worked last year, most people here don't know shit."
2021-05-31 21:09:28,stocks,The end is near...this time... the last hundred times were just a bait
2021-06-01 00:23:49,stocks,"You're right it isn't completely true. But, it may as well be.

2008 Crash. Everyone was pumped and primed for major catastrophe, long before it actually occurred. If more level-headed philosophies were engaged (i.e. Yes it is a problem, but we can work to find ways to mitigate it.) then we may well have had a much easier time of it. Instead, we got a chicken-little response that turned into a self-fulfilling prophecy(, or that's how it looked from my perspective, anyway).

As far as the Covid response from the market, I'm pleasantly surprised. It could have been a lot worse. That said, if we weren't as agile as we are (working remotely, travelling for business, global diversification, etc.) there's a good chance that the virus may never have left China. It's all hind-sight, and can't be undone, so it doesn't really matter.

What does matter is that people don't get drug down by the nervous Nellies, or the folks who enjoy making others miserable. Stiff upper lip, and all that."
2021-06-01 11:01:17,stocks,Thanks for your sacrifice
2021-06-01 11:03:37,stocks,Sold!
2021-06-01 14:17:03,stocks,"Of course not, I was just illustrating a fun property of the market as a system."
2021-06-01 13:04:50,stocks,Nobody on Wall Street or finance got laid off. Very few white collar layoffs as well
2021-06-01 07:13:21,stocks,Year before last. Not this year.
2021-05-31 20:40:55,stocks,"Ok like bears don't exist. Chill bud, go have a toke. Sorry you lost all your money."
2021-05-31 21:01:26,stocks,Then sell crystal balls
2021-06-01 16:01:45,stocks,"Again that doesnt mean a crash didnt happen.

What you're saying is a we avoided a recession, which is two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth, and yes that is true we did not have a recession, but we definitely had a stock market crash"
2021-05-31 20:46:15,stocks,"I think kitchbitch likes when stocks go on deep discount, nothing personal. Also, there is no difference between someone speculating the market will go up or someone speculating it will go down. It's all the same. Not sure where the us vs them mentality came from in general. People are very confused about what a hedge fund actually is"
2021-05-31 20:45:23,stocks,"I am very frustrated that I took my 401k out of the stock market back in April last year because I thought Covid was going to destroy all of business.  My 401k today is still sitting as cash at $180,000"
2021-05-31 20:42:41,stocks,"Lol it's you who clearly lost, that is the only logic for WANTING a crash, clown. Like please explain how I 'lost all my money' based on the fact I don't want the market to crash lololol?

I've become a millionaire thanks to covid recovery and cannabis plays and I'm happy the market recovered for everyone else who held through. A lot of people were very worried their retirements would be wiped out, just imagine that if you were in their shoes you selfish bear. 

Bears like you are evil imo, selfish and greedy because you didn't have the balls to buy last year."
2021-05-31 21:04:55,stocks,Can't go wrong with a business model like that!
2021-05-31 20:47:00,stocks,This guy gets it.
2021-05-31 20:49:15,stocks,I mean that's just smart. You saw the potential for a huge loss and ran. That's good looking out.
2021-05-31 20:45:32,stocks,A millionaire that’s spends your free time getting into arguments on Reddit SAD
2021-05-31 20:45:32,stocks,"First off. I'm not a bear big guy. I'm just hoping to see the big reset again. And if you really made millions you wouldn't be butt hurt in a subreddit. Get bent loser. 😂

Edit. Lololololol loser"
2021-05-31 22:03:48,stocks,Maybe even launch an IPO
2021-05-31 20:50:04,stocks,"Lol that's literally the purpose of reddit, and we all are here no?

Plus a million-ish isn't that much in 2021. 600k in 2000 is approximately the equivalent of 1M today, inflations a bitch. We all need at least 1 million in retirement to be relatively comfortable."
2021-05-31 20:53:49,stocks,"Anybody who made millions on the first dip would be drooling over the next one. 

Still running the day-trade acct....Still maxing employer retirement...

But I’m sitting on a big pile while I wait. 

An actual correction 3 months ago would have avoided this yo-yo market we’ve had. Would have been better."
2021-05-31 20:54:27,stocks,"Lol OH OK you're only a bear if it benefits you lolol and then you flip bull, got it that sure makes sense. 

Tons of you on Stock Twits always losing, always desperate for another crash."
2021-05-31 20:57:55,stocks,Hey Mr millionaire. I'm not a bear. I'm never a bear. I don't take profits on markets downs Wich is what a Bear is. I just want to see a giant dip and hopefully clowns like you lose everything. But...cool man. Do you boo boo.
2021-06-01 00:00:00,stocks,"CHWY- What is their moat? I see people on this subreddit hype Chewy a lot. I just don't understand what's so special about e-commerce for animals. Aside from brick-and-mortar competitors like Petsmart and Petco getting into the online businesses, Amazon and Walmart and probably use their scale to have lower prices and faster delivery than a smaller competitor like CHWY.

What am I missing?"
2021-05-31 20:19:15,stocks,They really do have great customer service. We ordered a sweater for one of our dogs and it was too big so we processed an exchange. They contacted us and told us to keep it and suggested we donate it to a shelter.
2021-05-31 21:04:07,stocks,"Their customer service is phenomenal. I cancelled my specialty cat food subscription when my cat passed away, and they sent a card with their condolences and flowers. Best prices on pretty much everything, especially if you do a subscription for the everyday stuff like cat litter, food, medicine. Shows up when it should and I've never had something go out of stock. They carry hard to find brands and better quality than most of the crap on Amazon these days. Great with returns and exchanges also! I don't care if it takes an extra day (it usually doesn't) but I'll always shop with them first."
2021-05-31 20:35:03,stocks,"I use it for my 1 dog and 2 assholes/cats. 

Prices are better than brick and mortar & what I saw on Amazon. Quick shipping and good customer service. My 2c."
2021-05-31 21:43:48,stocks,"From what I hear, their customer service it top tier and they're reasonably priced with just a good experience using them."
2021-05-31 23:37:17,stocks,"Customer service is the moat. It’s like Publix vs other grocery stores...that grocery chain provides a customer service level which draws loyalty and fandom. Chewy does that as well for their market.

You know why Zappos is so successful? The same reason Chewy is... their customer service. Do you see the trend?"
2021-05-31 20:53:43,stocks,"Amazon tried to beat them and lost. 

There’s something to be said about specialization especially when it comes to people and their pets. Amazon prices and quality can be all over the place and Chewy hit upon a reliable model for pet necessities before Amazon did."
2021-05-31 21:41:50,stocks,"It’s like nobody in this thread actually owns an animal.  We own 1 dog and get food and treats from Chewy.  Prices are cheaper than brick and mortar and wildly cheaper than Amazon.  We don’t do it for their customer service or any other reason - we get Holistic Select food just for reference.  

Chewy has the best prices, fast shipping, and if we fuck something up they are as easy as Amazon to deal with.  Is it really that hard to see why they’re successful?"
2021-06-01 06:48:03,stocks,"Regarding Chewy’s business model, they do a bit more than just delivering the same old pet food and pet toys imho.

Vets are able to directly input prescriptions for your pets at Chewy, so things like medicine, ointments, special foods & care items are increasingly being bought through Chewy. (Vets typically don’t have a wide variety of stocks on hand, and understandably, many owners prefer things to be shipped to their home rather than having to come back for them in a few days time) This is apparently taking a lot of sales away from local vets, so Chewy is getting a piece of the pie from vets across the country, and aren’t just competing amongst other brick and mortar pet stores. They also recently started free online vet consultations for their autoship subscribers, so I imagine they’ll be taking even more businesses away from vets in the future. My guess is that they’ll venture into pet insurance next (maybe a Lemonade type of insurance service would be doable? Or maybe they’ll just become a sales agency.. Who knows) which is likely lucrative too. With more people not getting married/opting out of having children, the pet industry is going to keep growing.

You’re right that these are all things Amazon or Petco can do too, but I’ve found brand loyalty for pet businesses to be highly emotionally driven, so everyone here gushing about their excellent service and customer experience is quite a significant telltale! BTW They have a great selection of items for all sorts of animals, from horses to chickens to fish to reptiles. You should check out their website when you have a chance, it’s quite fun."
2021-05-31 20:29:20,stocks,"I see so many packages from this company - I guess I just live near pet owners.

Question for anyone who uses them or otherwise knows: do customers typically buy from them as they need it, or through some kind of recurring/subscription based program? If it's the latter, I'd feel like they'd have some more stickiness."
2021-06-01 00:24:29,stocks,"Dog owner. Chewy for life. Own some shares. Every birthday they ship her a card. Whenever some thing breaks, return no questions asked. Diarrhea on food. Refund easily. Heard If pet dies they send you flowers."
2021-06-01 10:56:52,stocks,"I have a dog and had 2 cats. One of my cats was very sick and required prescriptions to be refilled monthly. Chewy delivered those meds reliably along with everything else we needed. Our vet loved them too and specifically asked me to use Chewy instead of a competitor that was a lot more difficult to deal with. My cat has since passed but I've remained a loyal Chewy customer.

What Chewy does right is that they have an ""auto-ship"" situation that is basically a subscription. People need to buy pet products on a regular basis. When Chewy acquires a customer, they have that person locked in for recurring sales for a decade. They're in the perfect spot in a booming pet industry.

But that doesn't mean Chewy is perfect. They are a retailer. They don't offer any proprietary products and they have to maintain a rather sizable inventory. It's tough to be profitable in retail and there are only a handful that are worthwhile investments. They're already booming so it's not like you're getting in early on them either."
2021-05-31 22:44:02,stocks,There is no moat. It's just a better service that people prefer. The responses I've read in this thread so far have shown no definitive moat.
2021-05-31 20:15:46,stocks,"I couldn’t tell you. We got a hamster a few months ago, and like you said, some stuff came from petsmart. Other stuff came from petco, and the rest came from Amazon. I looked at chewys website but I have serious e-commerce site fatigue at this point. Unfortunately for everyone else, Amazon just seems to get my online dollars."
2021-05-31 23:31:21,stocks,"Nah, Chewy has no defensive moat whatsoever. I did an analysis on them last month and recommended shorting the company. 

Their business is highly replicable and their margins suck. Petco is the better long-term bet.

The short recommendation panned out since I posted the article when it was trading at $84.04 with a PT of $65. I recommended selling on 5/12 at $67.72 for a 19%+ gain and the next day, 5/13 it broke below $65 and achieved my price target. 

I'm all for the pet industry but I don't believe that Chewy can command a high multiple like that given the pending onslaught of competition in the online pet delivery space.

If you'd like to read more in-depth on how I came to this conclusion, you can take a look at the post below and also the one I wrote on why I'm long Petco.

2021-05-31 20:35:39,stocks,"E-commerce (in the context of Amazon, Walmart, Chewy, etc) is in a huge bubble right now because while it’s expanding quickly, there’s nothing to differentiate them from one another. The sticking point is that they’re all selling other people’s products. They have private labels that are low cost exclusives, not desirable high value items. There’s no compelling reason to stick with one over the other, except for intangibles that really only scratch at the margins. Yes, Amazon is top dog right now but notice how they’re scraping more and more at the bottom of the barrel with marketplace listings. 

Compare this to the recent rise in specialized products and direct marketing on Facebook and Instagram. You have sites that directly sell to consumers with Square payments or Shopify. These develop a rabid base and you control your profits. You can’t find these products on Amazon or Chewy, so these companies have the real moat."
2021-05-31 22:16:02,stocks,"Never understood either. The only thing Reddit ever says is that they got great customer service, and people here themselves use it. Other than that, thats really it. Don’t know anything about the fundamentals and they seem to be in a lot of competition plus they sell products in a pretty niche field overall doesnt scream anything to me."
2021-05-31 21:09:06,stocks,I don’t think they’ve dug into any one thing aside no brick and mortar.
2021-05-31 23:23:35,stocks,"Petsmart actually purchased Chewy and then split it off a couple of years later... Chewy is definitely less expensive and more convenient than Petsmart, I’m a fan as a customer but their stock is overpriced. I believe last quarter was the first time they saw profitability and they made a whopping $.05 per $70+ share."
2021-06-01 12:45:29,stocks,"Ever noticed how literally every person in the US has at least 1 pet. Dog ownership is like a psychotic craze in this country. 

I've spoken with owners who actually refer to their pets as their children... might even love them more than their own kids. They'll spend whatever... whenever!

With Chewys brand loyalty and connection to pet owners. They will be able to work with customers to identify current/future trends and needs. It's more than dog food. 

I'm long holding 20 shares. Physical pet stores are dying. CHEWY is growing."
2021-06-01 13:38:14,stocks,Amazon's comingling of inventory from third party sellers means even if you purchase from a legit seller you might gets goods from a less than ethical one selling the same product.  This means you have to worry about feeding Fido dog food made from rats or something worse.
2021-05-31 22:20:15,stocks,"Nothing. AMZN has the same stuff & gets it to me quicker. If I give them lip they refund me. 

It’s a tech stock so it’s ‘hot’. It’s dog shit. 


PRTS is the CHWY of auto parts. Going to kill Autozone O’reiley & the others. AMZN won’t touch car parts because there’s too many versions. The want high turnover which is why PRTS can niche into it. I did a DD post. Look through my history if u want the whole thing. 

Imo the only thing CHWY, which is partly owned by Petsmart, is franchise style vet offices which are already inside petsmart. It’s going to free fall when the growth & profit slows. 

Unless AMZN gets TERRIBLE PR somehow to drive all pet owners away, which is very u likely."
2021-05-31 23:03:00,stocks,they have none really.
2021-06-01 10:10:56,stocks,Amazon lost to them plus they have Daddy Cohen
2021-06-01 00:29:53,stocks,"I used Chewy for regular shipments of food for my dog — which was either cheaper than or unavailable on Amazon — and when he died, I forgot to cancel the auto-renewal a day or two later. The customer service rep gave me his condolences, refunded the charge, and suggested I donate the food to a local shelter in my dog’s name. It meant a lot to me."
2021-06-01 08:57:01,stocks,"This - Amazon and Walmart sucks when you need to talk to someone.  Chewy actively makes your day better regardless of why you call.  Send flowers to people who they know lost a pet to death, etc."
2021-06-01 14:22:46,stocks,"I can attest to this as well. Ordered a dog gate that didn't work and they were so polite and understanding and told me to donate to a shelter or rescue service. I've been a customer since then. Also, prices are competitive and they ship for free."
2021-05-31 20:21:14,stocks,"Customer service is really tricky to nail down though. All it takes is one bad employee to ruin someone’s experience, and they won’t recommended the service to who they know. 

I’ve used Amazon before and the service was fine too."
2021-05-31 21:31:36,stocks,"I agree with all this.  They sent us a hand panted little picture of one of our cats, based on his Chewy profile pic, on his birthday.  That’s some serious effort to build brand loyalty."
2021-06-01 10:43:19,stocks,"It's a big stretch to say that Amazon tried to beat them and lost. Amazon never built out their pet section in any meaningful way (no specialty, no prescriptions). That's not their business model. Amazon is like Wal-Mart, they have everything but don't specialize in anything. They don't care about anything in particular and that's why specialty e-commerce still have room to thrive.

Chewy destroyed PetSmart and PetCo. B&M retailers that never bothered creating an e-commerce platform and Chewy came in with their stellar marketing and ate into them."
2021-05-31 23:23:34,stocks,"this is why GME is worth 500-1000 a share without a squeeze, Ryan knows what he is doing and GME has 55 Million email subscribers, huge head start from Chewy going from the ground up."
2021-05-31 23:39:00,stocks,"Man, I wonder what the guy who started chewy is doing now. Seems like he created a stellar company in chewy."
2021-05-31 21:09:22,stocks,"They offer subscription/recurring with tons of options, and I can say I've always had flawless delivery. It's fantastic if you're a multi-pet household."
2021-05-31 22:22:26,stocks,You’d think so but customers aren’t really too loyal to e-commerce. If I can get the same thing elsewhere cheaper or quick why wouldn’t i
2021-05-31 20:16:28,stocks,Thanks for the feedback.
2021-05-31 23:33:35,stocks,I’ll look into CHWY puts but I’m not the biggest fan of Petco either. I see future price wars between e commerce for animals.
2021-05-31 23:33:01,stocks,"Also, if you subscribe, I'm also releasing a new LONG article for a pet company tomorrow :) 

Stay tuned!"
2021-05-31 22:24:41,stocks,Nah man. AMZN advertising?  A whole other level than FB & there’s not really a ‘Snapchat’ to Amazon. Who’s the legitimate competition? People will pay a lot to have their product on page 1 of a search. Then AMZN bangs them with every few possible. Listing. Shipping. Returns?  Sellers problem. They’re paying.
2021-05-31 21:34:40,stocks,CRM investment and analysis. It’s in their S1
2021-06-01 10:16:59,stocks,To early to say that. Judging from the comments on this thread they have no moat
2021-05-31 20:58:11,stocks,"I’ve had the same experience. We were on a vacation and I forgot to change back our address. Next order went to the wrong place. I called them, explained the situation and asked them if I could return it and they said the same thing. Donate and we will ship another box of dog food to your address for free.

Best customer service I have seen in a long time."
2021-05-31 20:22:58,stocks,Agreed but I think this instance was an above and beyond example. Leads me to believe it’s in their culture. We’ve continued to use them since that purchase.
2021-05-31 22:10:23,stocks,"OP, you seem to be missing that **Ryan Cohen started Chewy.**"
2021-06-01 00:44:40,stocks,Yep! I got one of my dog too. Bullish
2021-06-01 00:17:10,stocks,Don’t know about $500-$1000 but GME is far from dead and the current price won’t look so nuts if he pulls off what he pulled off with Chewy. Will it happen? He’s got believers.
2021-06-01 00:20:52,stocks,If gme captures enough of the computer and gaming sector I can see this happening. Bullish on gme.

2021-05-31 23:47:10,stocks,"Petco is a good LT hold. I priced them at $30 a share and their most recent earnings (last week) they best top line and bottom line (adjusted) and raised full year forecast.

2021-05-31 21:07:32,stocks,It's their culture. Bought pricey dog stairs that my dog ended up refusing to use. Impractical to ship back because they couldn't be taken apart once assembled. They told me to donate to a shelter or pet family in need and refunded no problem!

2021-05-31 23:50:06,stocks,"To each their own. Your article on Petco is great, but how would you address the worries that because all these animal commerce companies often sell the same items, people will just shop around online for the lowest price and hurt margins?"
2021-06-01 01:39:21,stocks,"Well their management is paid millions despite their businesses failing so taking workers from other companies isn’t something to be excited about.

$550M is peanuts for all the R&D and CapEx they will have to be doing for their magical new profitable businesses model. Microsoft, an already well established company with little innovation happening in big areas like Windows, LinkedIn, and Microsoft 365  spends $16 BILLION annually in R&D. The only way GME can raise that kind of capital is diluting shareholders to hell, which is terrible for those long on GME.

Edit: They burned through 673 million in 2019, good luck to then with half a billion in cash lol"
2021-06-01 00:35:24,stocks,Lol advertise their sales for what? New games they can drive half an hour to a game stop to haggle for with a depressed employee and get an old game at a mark up?
2021-06-01 09:55:00,stocks,Chewy is not unique in  pretty much any way. I don’t think they’ll last long
2021-06-01 07:35:28,stocks,So that makes two who don’t understand sarcasm.
2021-06-01 00:04:43,stocks,"I'm glad you brought this up and I touch upon in in my articles.

There's 3 key points that I think makes for a good pet company to invest in.

* How many growth avenues do they have for revenue
* How defensible are their moats
* How fast can they get it to you

These three reasons are why I chose PETCO for the long haul

But as per your question, it's a combination of price/durability.

Many of these companies carry a lot of brands but many of them are either exclusive to them or are private label.

Exclusivity keeps customers loyal to their platform while private label offers way higher margins that can be used as leverage during price wars.

I believe about 70% of Petco's products are exclusive to them. 

So even if many companies offer the same stuff, not all are created equal.

Chewy was the first to do DTC pet food/supplies and deliver it very quickly, but it's not proprietary.

Now (explained in my article), Petco has their retail stores as distribution channels, buy online and pickup in store, same day delivery through DoorDash (which is free), grooming, training, vet clinics, vet hospitals and a subscription service and subscription box.

They're crushing it and Chewy doesn't really have much besides scale and first mover advantage (which won't last long).

Even their ultra fast delivery of 1-2 business days can't beat same day.

It's a hot space and I'm glad I was able to drive in deeper into these two companies."

2019 they had no e-commerce plans in the works and none of the current board members were involved. They shut down a bunch of locations and did share buybacks in 2020. Then did everything else I mentioned in the first 5 months of 2021.

NFT platform changes that with the ability to sell your digital games and countless other things like selling your actual game files. It’s going to be a gamer exchange essentially.

2021-06-01 09:53:54,stocks,It’s far to early to see if Chewy can take on Amazon. They have no moat so it’s likely only a matter of time.
2021-06-01 02:29:56,stocks,"Chewy has not nearly came close enough to beating Amazon. Amazon is still miles ahead in every metric like revenue. And Chewy had first mover advantage unlike GME.

So people would sell their old games to GameStop? What would GameStop do with all those old games no one wants? This sounds like an easily to replicate system where the only way to differ from competitors is offering more money for peoples old games, which surely sounds like a profitable businesses model.

If people want to trade games with each other, god damn Reddit has a sub for that r/gametrade. Why would people trade through GameStop’s platform for them to take a cut? You mentioned game progress and saves being included, but that already happens when people sell accounts to others. Besides, if a random Redditor like you or me can know this information, you’d think Microsoft devs would write a few lines of code to make that an optional feature of gifting games and eliminate the need for a middleman like GameStop, again!

Are you really going to say GameStop will have lower prices then AMAZON? Amazon is the king of cutting prices and driving others out of businesses. Do you think 12B GameStop with half a billion in cash can take on Amazon in e commerce? People use Amazon because prices are low, it’s the dominant e commerce market place, and it has big scale and companies it works with. I can refund my Amazon packages at the local Kohl’s. Does GameStop have the leverage to do that? Nope. And there’s much more to Amazon then games, too."

I can buy used games on the exchange from a gamer in China, it’s not being sold to GameStop dude. You and I can buy each other’s used games, get it? A famous streamer can now sell his game files to his fans.

People already trade stuff? Yes of course, now it will all be streamlined on one place, right on my PlayStation. And like I said, currently once you buy games online you’re stuck with them. Who in their right mind wouldn’t take advantage of being able to get back some of their money for a game they already beat and will never play again? 

Like really? You think people would rather buy physical games and trade them on reddit or buy from the systems store and never get value back instead of just buying online through GameStop’s exchange knowing you’ll be able to sell it once you don’t want it? Why sell an entire account on some website when you can just sell specific game files right from your system? GameStops brick and mortar issue was only convenience, that’s no longer an issue when I can buy and sell anything on my system with a few clicks and I can buy a system, controller, gamer chair with same day delivery from my smartphone. Stop it.

People kept pointing up e-commerce, but no one is giving specifics on what specifically they will do in that field. E commerce is decently saturated and I find it hard to believe GameStop and their half a billion in cash can compete with Amazon and Walmart"
2021-06-01 10:12:14,stocks,"You can trade digital games online like on Reddit, where it is already streamlined into one place r/Gametrade. In order for you to get your money back, you’d have to sell old games to other people. People don’t want your old games likely, and like I said there are already placed for people to do this trading. There is no reassurance you can sell your old games because they are old and hardly anyone wants them. Pretty niche market too.

Your point about trading files is well taken, but it’s such a niche market and game consoles like the Xbox can easily integrate it in their platforms so I don’t see the usefulness of GameStop there.

Chewy from my understanding has no unique products unlike competitors such as Petco. They’re selling the same products as others online so price wars will likely eat into margins. Customer service is not a good moat in of itself because all it takes is one moody employee for some and everyone they know to stop using the products. I’ve used Amazon in the past and have had to get refunded multiple times and it was a breeze so Chewy is not alone in this category"

This company is called WAITR Holdings WTRH and actually has been around longer then Door Dash Post Mates or GrubHub… Unfortunately, years ago the company had many issues…. Luckily we are here when they have turned it around!

**WAITR Joins forces with Red Robin to offer delivery to 50 locations**

**WAITR signs deal with Flynn Restaurant group one of the nation’s largest franchisee which has Applbee’s, Pizza hut, Wendy’s, Taco Bell, Panera and Arbys!**

**WAITR Partners with BJ’s Restaurant and brewery**

**These are just the last 30 days!!!**

Also note that the market cap is just 235 million. Sales have increased greatly. First I will note that in November/December there were insider buys around $2.75. Tilman Fertita owns 5%+ of the company. The billionaire casino/restauranteur

2021-06-01 04:10:14,stocks,"SQ all the way. If we assume that AI/ML is an upcoming gold rush, the companies with the most data to train will, in my opinion, likely be the victors. SQ’s blend of eCommerce (Weebly) and physical POS give them unbelievably granular data at the per-transaction and per-customer level, ie they can see the cost and items sold for both physical and virtual storefronts and create customer profiles across both media. Facebook/Google know your identity and when you click an ad, but don’t always know whether or not that click resulted in a completed transaction, and almost certainly don’t know the exact items purchased and total cart value. They have to infer while Square knows.

As an example, they’ve started to monetize this data with their commercial loan offerings. They know a company’s SKUs, sales, and unique customers and tailor loan packages based on that. The rate and length are, I assume, likely calculated based on the transaction history for the company and the results for loans made to similar companies. Square can use data to define their default risk at a level most banks cannot. Square has mentioned in previous calls how low their default rate is compared to industry. The loans are repaid on a fixed amount, per-item basis instead of with traditional amortization. Business owners I’ve chatted with love it because it helps stabilize their cashflow while using the loan to grow business. That is, for a $1,000 loan: “pay Square 50 cents per cup of coffee until you’ve repaid $1,032” vs “pay Chase $86.07 per month for one year”. Square knows the company will likely sell 2,064 cups of coffee in a year based on the individual transaction history for that vendor. I know the loans are currently a small portion of revenue, but I think represent where the company is headed as far as monetizing their treasure trove of data to create entirely new products or reimagine traditional financial products.

That said, I can’t wrap my head around the valuation right now. 20x revenue multiple is too rich for me. Full disclosure, I recently sold for some other opportunities and hope to buy in when the prices return to planet earth."

Just knowing whatever happens to SQ, any buyer today is at 3x the risk for 1/3 of the profit than someone who bought just 1 year ago.

2021-06-01 02:57:15,stocks,What’s the ticker now ?
2021-06-01 00:39:33,stocks,It's not going to kill the stock market. It's going to kill the return on long term holders. You'll essentially need any long term stock price to appreciate 20% more than it is currently in order to get the same return you get RIGHT NOW without doing ANYTHING because long term tax rate going up no matter what. Whether it is what's proposed currently or not is a big question. But what's for certain is what I have in my bank currently.
2021-05-31 23:25:42,stocks,"It's the tax reason dude. Biden tax plan will essentially double my tax if it passes in its current form. The $170 is where I think it should be valued and would probably be my re-entry point should I get back into SQ. I'm not worried about it getting down to $170 at all. I can care less. I already sold bruv. At $200-$225 prices unfortunately. 

There was a lot of reasons for me to sell SQ right now. Top reason: securing the bag. Second reason: taxes. Those are easy to understand. But my biggest concern outside those two is the market pressure put on $SQ. I don't think there is anything fundamentally wrong with it. It's just the fundamentals are completely overblown in the stock price. It's $100B company with less than $10B revenue and less than $200M profit. Talk about future earnings getting pulled back. It was even more looney when you realize it's price was almost $300 a share. 

Another precarious situation is cathie wood and her ARK funds. If shit get bad and redemptions happen to her fund, you're going to see another Archegos situation all over again...only this time it will be BAD. 

Anyway, I'm on the Michael burry train of inflation. I went from a lot of tech to massive diversification in things like KR, BP, and WFC. I'm no longer playing offense to grow my portfolio. It's already grown. I'm playing defense to try and maintain my gains. So I can figure out what I want to do moving forward. If that doesn't make sense to you it's probably because we are at different stages of the game. Or maybe playing for something different. Younger me though would definitely call present me a wuss lol."
2021-05-31 22:51:35,stocks,"Currently pulled it out of my tda account and it's sitting in the bank. I don't want to trade it because I lost a lot in march being dumb. I'd much rather hodl it and figure out what I want to do with it. Feel completely stupid for not selling some when it was almost $300. But when you hold something for so long, you think you will never sell. But a good chunk was in my IRA and a lot of that is in AMC puts ending august because that's when their ER is. I've been averaging into that position for the last week. This AMC shit will blow over by then and I will get an absolutely positive return. Whether it's big or not is questionable because IV is so high."
2021-06-01 01:06:15,stocks,I don't plan on it hitting 170. I'm saying I would for sure  buy again if it's hits $170

2021-06-01 00:47:56,stocks,It's literally what was proposed. And this isn't progressive tax because it's not ordinary income. It's long term capital gains.
2021-06-01 00:55:30,stocks,"Well the proposal is to tax long-term gains over $1m as ordinary income... so no, it would only apply to the long-term gains that occur beyond the first $1m. As I said, I’m pretty sure you don’t understand the proposal."
2021-06-01 00:57:40,stocks,I don't think you understand my tax situation.
2021-06-01 01:18:48,stocks,"Well if you’re making more than $1m in long-term capital gains a year, you’re probably going to be just fine, increased tax or not. It’s going to be okay."
2021-06-01 09:39:29,stocks,"I think the original comment needed context. The original comment makes it sound like it will effect everyone, when I think a lot of people here fall under the 1 mil category.

2021-06-01 01:26:03,stocks,"Cool? If you’re rolling the dice and continuing to hold just so you can hopefully pay less in taxes, it seems like you’re gonna cost yourself way more than whatever the tax increase might be. But good luck."
2021-06-01 01:47:30,stocks,"It's more about bag secured than anything. If interest rates go up, which they will, it hurts growth stock because of how beta is calculated in CAPM theory. When that happens, you should expect growth stocks to dip. When I say $170 as entry point, it's what I am 100% willing to get in. I don't actually expect it to get there but in march it showed evidence of dipping to $180 or lower."
2021-06-01 02:20:51,stocks,That has.. no relevance to anything I just said. Good luck man. You sound like you need it.

2021-06-01 00:00:00,stocks,"Went against general sentiment here and purchased 20K worth of APPL This is my first stock purchase ever. I'm 27, I've had money tied up in a house for the past several years, and have idly sat on the sidelines as certain stocks I flirted with in 2016 went up exponentially (AMD, I see u).

I am a layman when it comes to Stocks, and ETFs, and Calls/Puts etc. I opened a Schwab account a couple of weeks back and bought 20K of APPL @ around 127.00 (I was scared it would jump, if I sat around waiting for a targeted stock price). I posted here prior to making that move, and was generally pointed towards ETFs like VTI, VT, and the like. But Idk, APPL's trendy and seems, almost criminally, underrated. I plan to @ least hold this investment for 5 years, maybe longer.

Part of me did want to go the tranquil route of ETFs and Mutual Funds, but I do not know. Chalk up to being a desperate millennial looking for a safe alternative to Meme Stocks/Crypto, or long term speculation. Regardless, I sit comfortably positioned and as confident on APPL as I would on any ETF.

Again, I'm a novice. Help me find da way. I do have another 10-15K or so (not my emergency fund, I promise) just sitting around in a savings account. I am tempted to double DWN if APPL dips."

2021-05-31 21:45:08,stocks,I am wondering if I shouldn’t own more GLD myself. I think AAPL will trade sideways for a while and then IDK. I lean towards thinking it will dip more before it has another good run. A long term position should not worry much though. And holding cash waiting for a killer purchase is a grand idea.

2021-05-31 23:38:06,stocks,I think you made a solid choice. I did the EXAT same move back in 2014. Right after the split I bought two companies. Netflix and Apple. I bought more every chance I could and never looked back. People here will say index funds but apple is the heart of almost every single one.  For your next right now I suggest MSFT GOOG or even FB. I’m a huge fan of MSFT right now and think they’re in a big position to rip very soon and clear 300 to bring them into the 2 trillion club. This will also help Apple as they won’t be so shiny at the top. Best of luck to you!!!

It’s hard to hold this company down at at anytime in history.

They charge so much for thier stuff, and then render it useless in a few years. Forcing anyone who loves thier things to get newer at those ridiculous prices.

Any one stock, no matter how strong of a company, is a risky investment. I would take a look at how the great companies of the past have fared in the long term. Plenty of once great companies have fallen from grace, and there is no warning to tell you when it’s time to get off the train.

Diversify. It’s one of the few things that is truly a “free lunch” in investing. You don’t get any extra expected return from refusing to diversify away from company risk. A single blue chip stock is not an adequately stable investment, no matter how strong the company may seem."

2021-06-01 01:55:14,stocks,"Did this guy/girl just say that 2nd biggest company in the world is undervalued????? How do you drop 20K with that little research or understand of valuation. OP the value of a stock is not the price it trades for, Amazon which trades for idk 12x the cost of Apple is valued at 2/3rd of Apple. You did buy an overall good stock just may wanna research some more first. And trust me Apple is highly “regulated” by big money, they will always control the value of Apple hence why it moves so little and on many days controls the S&P 500. I think this lack of understanding may have been why people suggested an ETF. Also the investor who DCA’s their money will be more successful 9/10 times. Also good to train your brain to be happy when the market or asset goes down for a reason that won’t affect the long term, because investors are buyers and buyers want things cheaper - this is a lesson that took me a couple months to wire my brain to. Green Day’s are nice, but I almost never buy on green days. Would you rather buy your coffee for 3$ or buy the same coffee for 5$? That’s the mentality of a long term investor. I wish the best of luck to you OP, you did pick well even though your not diversified. Just please learn more before throwing around what sounds like a lot of money to you. And ALWAYS REMEMBER if it’s a good company and it’s down from where you bought it than in the long run it will eventually surpass where you bought it, which I’m not wizard but I bet Apple will surpass 130 again easily.

You can also check on how to create a covered call(with stocks you own) and make money out of premium while holding the stock but the risk is you will lose the share if the stock hits the strike price(some times even if they dont if the buyer exercise the option which I dont think anyone do), in which case you will also land a short term profit.

You bought for $127. You can create a covered call monthly or weekly for $130 or even $140(the premium will get lower as you increase the strike price). 

So lets say you sell a covered call for $140. You need 100 shares of a company to sell one call option. I dont know how much monthly premium goes for but lets say its at 0.50 so the premium you get would be $50(minus commission fee if there is any) for selling one covered call. At any time the buyer of the call can exercise the option. He would have to exercise at $140 so you will be making $13 per share or another $1300 for the one call option you sold but when they exercise you lose your share."
2021-05-31 21:59:48,stocks,"AAPL is a solid stock pick, but the price is currently being held down by a number of factors -- not the least of which is that it's a victim of the company's success: it's the highest market capitalized company in the world, which means it is also one of the most widely held, too. Thus, whenever any fund needs some money to cover losses elsewhere, they sell off Apple stock.

On the plus side, Apple has expanded its buyback program to $90B *this year* which means that your shares will be inherently (in 2020, they bought back $50B) Additionally, they are increasing the dividend yield.

If you want to make more money on AAPL, look at writing (selling) way out of the money covered-calls."

If you find a great company that’s fairly valued or better, invest in. You could assign as much weight to it as you can. Warren Buffet’s portfolio i believe is about 40% Apple. 

Apple’s ecosystem is amazing. Everyone who uses it loves it. It’s a premium product but people pay for it. New iPhone should be coming out soon. They’re coming out with different products such as air tag. And their M chips seem to be very promising.

2021-05-31 22:39:33,stocks,"I like your conviction. Plenty of fund managers and ETFS are heavily weighted towards AAPL. History shows AAPL has been constantly underrated with bears talking about how their best is behind them, yet they are consistently proven wrong. 

If you want to throw your other 15k on top, go for it. My advice is to figure out if that stresses you out. You shouldn't be checking the ticker every couple of hours or even every day with a longer term view like what you have. If you do decide to invest elsewhere, don't choose another similar tech stock as they will both rise and fall together. 

Again, nothing wrong with only having one, two or three stocks. Just try to keep those few diversified also, or prepare to set and forget over the short term.

Some will say ""get in quickly before it goes up further"", but given the state of the market and monetary policy right now IMO it's much more likely to see a major pullback than a major push forward. 

It may creep up steadily but a leap forward is highly unlikely IMO.  If you had saved some cash you could build your position slowly whether or not there's a big pullback.  And if there is one then that's the moment to go all in. 

If you're going to be dumping the same amount in every year as this year then it's not really a big deal, but if not you'll get much better returns if you're able to buy low instead of just buying immediately at any price.  Definitely keep your cash on hand IMO!"

There is no harm in only buying single stocks with a couple hundred bucks at a time, instead of all in one one, to learn and have fun with while growing the rest in a diversified index fund. But your single stocks should almost be more 'play money' especially since you're new to this.

I have a financial advisor from a separate company completely but I also dabble in stocks with some expendables and I bought a ton of apple then decided to compare my picks with my FA and saw she also bought a shit ton of apple for my retirement portfolio. I genuinely believe in Apple as a company and think they're also undervalued as they stand. This is definitely a longterm hold for me as well. I'm also like 5 years older than you with not much trading experience so take what I say w/ a grain of salt but I trust my FA. She consistently beats the S&P returns the pasty 6 years.

Edit: also wanted to point out, my expendable account that I play with was nowhere near the 20K you procured. My FA, however, bought well over the $20k in early may. I fully intend to dump more expendable income into apple during this sale (as I view it). I, like you, do believe the company is undervalued right now and view a lot of growth potential in the next 5-10 years (not just consumer goods and services, but the company's encroachment onto the crypto market). I really don't have a great grasp on market fundamentals (I'm in healthcare and my profession is notoriously shitty with money management) so I guess take whatever I disclose with grain of salt.

If Apple doesn’t innovate more and stop banking on people buying overpriced phones with minor improvements every year, I actually see them declining over the next 10 years. They need to innovate more into the streaming service arena or the gaming arena or the music arena or something. Without innovation they will get overtaken by someone else (Google? Facebook? Amazon?

Moreover, at the end of the year Diablo 2 resurrected comes out, which should also be a tremendous success.

However, I did not trust my instinct, as I am new and just purchased, like you, shares of AAPL @ 127 (tho I bought 2 shares not shares worth of 20k, so I guess we are not in the same boat but maybe I am in a canoe, next to your boat).

The Wall St analysts always explain this away by saying that AAPL is always ""overvalued"" therefore no matter how much profit they make or what new technology they come out with, there's going to be very little correlation between performance and stock price.

Not to sound like a shill, but to be fair to them they offer software updates on phones & tablets for a longer period of time (at least five years) than most competitors, which only get two or three years of Android updates, and Apple devices hold their value much better. That means if you upgrade whenever updates stop, you're buying a $1000 phone or whatever every five years & getting a bigger chunk of the money back. I feel like they're cheaper in the longer term, which is the main reason I buy them.

Honestly not too sure that they'll do much in video conferencing other than incrementally improving things like Facetime which is more geared towards personal use, they almost definitely won't be looking to compete with  the likes of Zoom & MS Teams for corporate & enterprise use. Don't think they'll really grow *too* much in that space, but yeah they'll definitely focus more on health with the watch & what that enables them to do, and I'm half expecting *something* official about their push into EVs within the next 5-10 years."

2021-05-31 21:31:44,stocks,yes covered calls are a good way to exit or if you think that it will go down in short term. if you’re trying to sell you can choose an option that’s likely to expire in the money and sell when it’s exercised.
2021-05-31 21:34:14,stocks,"Ideally, you want to sell covered calls at X% higher than the price you bought and the price slowly increases or trades sideways. This way, you keep your shares when the calls expire and then you can toss them back in for another run."
2021-05-31 21:41:46,stocks,You can make about $100 a month per contract (100 shares)  at a 0.2 delta range with very little risk of getting your shares called away or missing out on gains. I would probably sell at 0.3 for about $160. AAPL tends to move slowly. If it does go over you could roll or just take the profit and buy the shares back. It really helps during the dips and delivers About 10% to 15% annual return. It looks like you would be selling 1 contract so probably best to trade on the monthly vs the weeklies as there tends to be tighter spreads. It's the week that has the 3rd Friday of each month.
2021-06-01 02:40:50,stocks,"Wow this thread is weird, lots of bad information going around.    
    
Ideally, when you buy a stock, you don’t just yolo buy it. You should have assessed its value, and in order to buy it, you must think it’s worth more than what it’s currently trading at (otherwise why would you buy it?).    
Now, having a general value of the stock in mind de facto implies that you also have a stock price that you think is “too much”. At this price, you would sell right now either way, because the price is too high, and it makes no sense.    
    
Replace right now with your expiration date, and give a similar value estimate for the stock for that time. That’s why you use covered calls.    
    
E.g.: AAPL is trading at 124. If through YOUR analysis, AAPL is worth 150 today, and taking everything into account, you modeled the growth and the cf of the company, and you came to the conclusion that it’s going to be worth 170 in a year, you might sell covered calls at 180-190 at an expiration date of next year.    
Remember, you think the stock will be worth 170. Why would you not sell when it’s more than you think it’s worth? If you’re right, it will get back to its intrinsic value and you can buy back into it. Until then, you can begin selling puts at your desired value strike price (but that’s a different topic)."

Funds are so popular they don’t get trashed so hard in a downturn but they don’t profit as much in the upswing either.  Nothing has changed about the companies she holds in my opinion, Palantir may be the next unicorn in her portfolio it has unlimited potential, it’s risky but that’s the price you pay for potential big gains.

>It just depends on the Android company. Most keep software updates for about the same period

I've always owned Android devices until I switched last year, and I honestly haven't owned a single one that offered at least five years of updates. Most usually offer 2-3 years. Even Pixel devices generally don't get more than 3 years. By comparison, the iPhone 6s (from 2015) is running the latest version of iOS (14.6).

>Coupled with the fact that they're by and large cheaper than an Apple, there's no way Apples are cheaper in the long run in most cases

If you're solely buying cheap budget phones, then maybe. But Apple has the SE line which offers the same 5+ years of updates but with slightly lower end specs & price. The Pixel 5 is \~US$700 if you buy from Google. The base iPhone 12 is \~US$800 (or $830 if you get it SIM free for some reason). The Pixel 5 will get updates until October 2023. The iPhone 12 will (based on [past trends](https://www.statista.com/chart/5824/ios-iphone-compatibility/)) probably get six OS updates and then ongoing bugfixes and whatnot once the OS updates stop coming like the 5s did once it stopped getting proper OS updates. If you only ever upgrade when you stop getting security updates, of course it'll be cheaper in the long run."

Market inefficiencies do exist. However, there is no reason to think they persist forever, or that they occur systematically, or with any specific directional bias. Pick a dividend paying stock at random and I have no more reason to think it's undervalued than that it is overvalued without concretely investigating the balance sheet and doing DD.

But that's the domain of value investing.

In the end, dividend investors are just stock pickers. Maybe you're a good stock picker (unlikely) or maybe you're not (more likely). Dividends don't figure into this.

>The religious belief is far more exemplified thinking stock prices are the closest measure of company insight or potential for total returns--that shit is far more liable to irrational swings than any dividend policy.

If you're buying a stock with dividends thinking the dividends are just free money, then there is no reason to think those ""irrational swings"" are in your favor than there is to think they're against your interests. You can't make those kind of sweeping, a priori generalizations.

If you buy a *specific* stock thinking it's *specifically* undervalued when looking at *total returns*, which includes stock price and dividend yield, then you may or may not be right depending on how good you are at appraising intrinsic company value.

To make things more topical, though, we're talking about Apple here. It's much less likely such a huge company with massive amounts of trading volume is undervalued than some random stock few people are actually looking at. It is much more likely the EMH does hold for Apple on even short time frames."

OK, let's recap how this conversation began. The person I was replying to said:

>AAPL dividends blow. You’ll get about 1 share a year with 20k worth.

I pointed out that you really shouldn't care about Apple's low dividend yield because that should just mean greater stock appreciation instead.

Now, are you saying that Apple, the most valuable publicly traded company in the world, is so fundamentally misvalued that it could support a significantly higher dividend without a corresponding decrease in its share price?

If no, you agree with me.

If yes, why? What evidence do you have to believe this is the case?

But I'm sure it's skill and ability in your case. Obviously you have a ton of skill as an investor if you yolo into a stock and make a lot of money. It's a tried and true investment strategy. 

Unfortunately, I was talking about 2021.

Don't worry. You're right. Just only look at good news that confirms your bias and you'll always be right, champ."
2021-06-01 15:00:38,stocks,"I'm sorry I didn't break that down simply enough. Some investors are driven by dividends and the idea of ""dividend kings"" as you might have learned by googling ""dividends""at some point in your life. That is a market force driving the price. The valuation is also a market force driving the price. Dividends are functionally marketing and loyalty programs, and no one has as yet managed to quantify and separate that out as a price impact. 

You can claim only the valuation matters, but if you ever meet a human you'll find they are emotional creatures who do not make market decisions purely based on math. Stop paying a dividend and your price will not simply rise. If you want to know more about that effect you can ask the American USO about charging for coffee.

Money can be exchanged for goods and services!"
2021-06-01 02:55:13,stocks,"Completely misframing what I said and doing it on purpose. You wrote dividends necessarily decrease stock price when that simply isn't true. 

Anywho people can read the posts you actually throw onto the internet. It's clear you're leaning hard into fool's good and are any anything but someone who cares about company fundamentals or even the long term solvency of market trends, much less the efficiency of the market.

You post about meme stocks, and that looks to be about all you do. Don't mischaracterize dividend investing because of your own insights into the market. A great deal of the total return of broad market investing comes from and has come from dividends, for a century, and you really wrote dividends are irrelevant.

No, short squeeze bullshit is irrelevant. Overwhelmingly dividend paying stocks create more wealth over time than other stocks, with a few exceptions which are mostly in the tech sector, and more power to them for refusing to pay their own investors back, ever.

2021-06-01 00:00:00,stocks,"The Investor's Skills and Knowledge Must-Haves Lately, I have been browsing the new sections of a few investing subreddits, and I came to the conclusion that a lot of us are in need of education on basic concepts that don't relate solely to stocks. 

I strongly believe that everyone that owns stocks should have at least a basic understanding of the following: 

&#x200B;

\- Statistics 101 and optional Bayesian Statistics, Correlation vs Causality and Nicolas Cage

\- Macro and Microeconomics: most importantly Behavioral Economics, Biases, Preferences, Supply and Demand, Interest rates, Money supply, Monetary Policy, Market Cycles, a bit of Game Theory, Unemployment, Inflation

\- Financial Reporting / Accounting: Financial Statements and their most important elements, a bit about the IFRS and/or US GAAP frameworks

\- Financial History: Black Friday, 2008 housing crash

\- Financial Institutions: Hedge Funds, Mutual Funds, Investment Banks, Commercial Banks

\- Psychology: The Big 5 Traits of Personality, Freud's Iceberg model and the Id, Ego and Super-Ego

\- Stock Valuation: P/E Ratio, P/B Ratio, CAGR, Margins and Ratios, ROE, ROA, Liquidity, EY, and their interpretations

\- Optional: Learn from the greats: Buffett, Munger, Lynch, Simons, Fisher, Graham

&#x200B;

You don't need to take any college courses for those. YouTube is your best friend for this. Fear is the product of not knowing what to expect and the respective odds. A basic understanding of these topics will most likely reduce FOMO, help you make more sound decisions, and maybe increase your returns in the long run. 

The best investment against inflation is in yourself. Happy learning!"

2021-06-01 00:45:19,stocks,"Great Post!

It might be worthwhile mentioning the Industrial Organization sub-field of economics. Go a bit beyond Game Theory.

This sub-field essentially studies all of the imperfections that can prevent a perfectly competitive market when analyzing how a particular marketplace is organized by different firms and what advantages some firms have.

This is often key, because it can provide many theories and details how some firms can take advantage of markets that are not perfectly competitive. By understanding where companies are able to find new advantages (or are losing advantages) you consider if the firm is able to make profits above what a perfectly competitive market place would be... and more profits to shareholders.

It can also has many ideas and theories that can help point out why one firm might have an upper-hand in a negotiation with another firm, which might lead to them taking a larger share of profits.

I find too many people understand the basic ideals of competition, but then incorrectly assume the marketplace is perfectly competitive.  By accepting they aren't and researching where they aren't, you can look at which firm has an upper-hand advantage to make more profits."

2021-05-31 23:16:46,stocks,"John Bogle's Little Red Book on Common Sense Investing should be a must read. He invented the index fund. He covers money managers and all sorts of topics that are really applicable today. He covers the concept of ""reversion to the mean"" and IMO takes the panic out of things for me. After reading this book I do a mix of index investing and equity investing. It also helped me put investing into perspective."

Psychology is generally just obvious stuff given new vocab (and people patting themselves on the back for it) and everything else is totally unreliable or plain wrong. Learn a science outside of math instead to get a leg up on at least some tech sectors. I highly recommend CS to cut past the BS peddled by many tech execs. 

Otherwise, the rest of your list is correct. The more you know, the better you will be able at projecting the future. This is obviously very valuable when it comes to stocks.

Youtube may not be enough to actually improve your problem solving skills. Just because one reads a math book does not mean they can solve a problem. Its better than nothing however."
2021-05-31 20:55:58,stocks,"Investing taught me a lot about macroeconomics, and just in general about separating signal (i.e. consequential news) from noise.

The idea behind understanding psychology is to get to know your own personality a bit better. Knowing what influences you and how your actions are shaped by the influences that you come in contact with can help. It helped me a lot personally so I thought it would be a nice addition. 

I find it important to actually think about your personality and to come to terms with it. All three concepts deal with these issues so I think they are also good life advice.

2021-06-01 00:00:00,stocks,Vanguard Stop vs. Stop Limit I'm confused by the stop vs stop limit option in vanguard. If I have a stock that the current price is $12 and I want to set up an order to sell once IF it ever goes down to $7. What order do I need to submit?
2021-05-31 23:10:49,stocks,"Just realize that when you see “stop” in the order name, it’s saying “don’t do anything until you reach this point”, like a stop sign, you stay put in your position until it’s time to go.

So a “stop loss buy” would be placed above the current stock price; you’d use this when you don’t want to miss out on a breakout of the stock.

A “stop loss sell” is what it says in its name, you want to stop your loss. Maybe you bought the stock and it jumped and now you want to capture some gains.

Both of the above orders will execute at whatever price the stock jumps to after the amount you set. But if the stock volume is crazy, it might go from a stop price of say “$10” to suddenly “$20”; conversely if you wanted to stop your losses at”$8” but it gapped down to “$5” where you bought it, the order would execute at the market price.

To avoid this, you set a “stop limit” which means “don’t do anything until the stop is reached, but don’t do anything beyond the limit”. So if you set a “stop limit sell”, supposing the stock is at “$9” and you bought at “$5”, you’d set a stop at “$8” and a limit of “$7”. If the stop is met but suddenly jumps to “$6” before your order is filled, it doesn’t execute. But if it creeps back up inside the limit, it will execute.

The big take away is how the orders execute, one is limit guaranteed and the other is at market."
2021-06-01 00:00:00,stocks,"ELI5: I just receive a packet in the mail of an “offer to purchase for cash” by a stock I own I own some MPC (Marathon Petroleum Corporation) and received a packet in the mail that says 

“Offer to purchase for cash by marathon petroleum corporation of up to 4,000,000,000 of its common shares at a purchase price not greater than 63 per share and not less than 56 per share”

Stock is currently at 61.80 for reference and has had a steady incline over the past year to about its pre-covid numbers 

It mentions something about tendering shares whatever that means.

So it seems they want to buy my stocks back? Why? Is this a good thing or a bad thing if you own said shares. Do you have to go through with it?"
2021-05-31 20:36:52,stocks,"Always read the offer carefully, but buried in there is usually a clause that essentially says market price, so long as it is within a range between A and B. Sometimes there is the slightest upside in the offer.

You need to do nothing, but it is an option if you wanted to sell. Companies do this to reduce shares, which increases the value of all stocks a little bit. I usually don’t participate, because to respond through my broker there is a small fee. They also like to reduce the number of total shareholders to reduce costs, so sometimes they send offers to smaller shareholders.

Another unique situation that can occur in rare cases, is it might be a good way to get out of a stock. A while back I owned yahoo. Yahoo went out of business and sold off various assets one at a time. They were left with a large stake in BABA, but there was no method to convert those to BABA shares and there were tax implications. It also wasn’t there only holding, just their largest. So the company became an investing holding company, but it wasn’t intended to be. They really wanted to close out the fund and the fund was delisted. So one of the first things they did was send out various offers to close out shares in this fun for properties they could readily sell. I still own some and the tiny amount that is left is held up pending find out about costs from something. There is really no good way to sell it, so if you had any your left waiting it out. Those situations are worth paying attention so, as it’s far easier to get the cash and not be stuck waiting on an unknown timeline to get the value from your holdings as the close up operations."
2021-05-31 23:34:48,stocks,"These offers used to be a lot more common for shareholders who owned less than 100 shares of a company, but that had largely disappeared.

Losses aren't either, but that isn't an issue, as in Ireland, you can't really reclaim losses. On gains, anything over €1.3k is taxed 33%. If I bought and held, I pay about 3% interest per year. My idea is simply to buy SPY. I have the ability to leverage myself somewhat as well, and in the event of a crash, I can very easily leverage myself. My question is, is it worth it?

If the spread isn’t fixed, my impression is that the broker can widen it which will get you margin called. And you pay a commission in form of the initial spread.

If the purpose is gambling, sure. But if you want to invest real money and for the long term, get a reputable broker and avoid sketchy products."
2021-06-01 06:17:19,stocks,"I know betting in the name gives it them grounds, but I've messed around with paper accounts, and you can easily lower your leverage to 1x on almost all stocks. Sure, I don't hold physical shares, but I'm not really limited in how long I can hold for, nor am I charged capital gains. Assuming I invest in the likes of SPY, I would consider the risk to be relatively low, in comparison to normal trading."

The other Canadian banks have also performed quite well, and still seem attractive, and all have good dividends ranging from 3 to almost 5%.

Similarly, if you look at BMO's US Banks ETF, ZWK (Covered Call US Banks) had a 1 y return of 57.27% compared to 65.01% from ZBK. 

The benefit for covered calls is that it can ensure you're still getting a yield when the markets drop or stays flat. I like it in retirement, but not worth it if you've got time for it to grow."

2021-06-01 00:25:07,stocks,"As a participant in the 1999/2000 tech boom/crash what I can say is - we all knew that the internet would change the world and were thus very keen to invest in it, but ... nobody could guess exactly how the transformation would work, and which technologies would take off and which would fail. The idea that a 'phone' would do more that carry voice was stupid. We'd hardly got used to the idea that a phone didn't need a cord.

So investors put money into everything, every crazy idea - some as stupid as watching a movie on a phone. The core firms survived the crash and thrived but a lot didn't. It was very hard to distinguish survivors and the dead before the crash and very easy for people today to look back today and say 'wasn't it obvious that a small online book shop would destroy large retail giants?' 'Wasn't it obvious that you would be able to get information without going to a library?'

Every transformational stock is priced based on its future cash flows (not current), and those cash flows involve a lot of heroic assumptions. Small changes to those assumptions create huge changes in the PV of those future cash flows. What would you have paid for that small online book shop in 1998 which had its office next to a strip club?"
2021-06-01 06:19:17,stocks,"Just look at the Buffett indicator to see if the markets overvalued. 

https://www.currentmarketvaluation.com/models/buffett-indicator.php

Currently it’s more overvalued than in the dot com bubble. Buffett was warning of the bubble before it popped but everyone dismissed him because they didn’t want to believe in the end of a bull run that’s making everyone money. Basically the indicator looks at the price of the entire stock market, as in the cost to buy every stock out there and compares it to the national GDP, the total dollar amount of all goods and services produced. Think about it. The more the ratio diverges the more overvalued the stock market has become. The best case is that stock prices stall as the actual economy catches up, worst case there’s a crash. The market is a voting machine for the price of a stock but at the end of the day how much dividends, real profits, the company can afford to pay you is the investment part and the rest is just noise from the crowd."
2021-06-01 10:38:11,stocks,"Back then, no one cared about earnings. It was the ""new economy"" versus the ""old economy"" and people felt the internet would change the world. In retrospect it looked insane, but that was a sign of the times. Today's market is not like 1999, and it irks me when people claim it's the same thing. In 1999, we didn't have tech companies making $100B+ a quarter and raking in tens of billion in profit per quarter.

2021-05-31 21:31:41,stocks,"If you know what created the dot com bubble it explains why people could not tell they were in a bubble at the time:

In the late 90s was the first time a large chunk of the US / world population had started investing due to online brokers popping up, like E*TRADE.  Before online brokers you had to physically go into a place and then call your broker to issue a trade.  It was not just inconvenient it was intimidating.  Online brokers brought investing to the masses for the first time.  This created a flood of people buying stock for their first time.  They did not know what an index fund was.  They just knew they could throw a dart at a news paper list of IPOs and would be guaranteed to make money.  They chose companies to invest in based on IPO listings and company names in the news.  No due diligence was had.  No paying attention to how high or low the market was, just noobs, noobs everywhere.  (Or should I say n00bs to represent the time period better?  XD)

The dot com bubble is actually the closest bubble to 1929 we've had in our life time and probably will be the closest we will have in our life time.  In the 1920s people learned their money was losing value and they were told the only way to combat this is not to save in a bank but to invest it.  From this the 1920s had a similar wave of first time investors.  None of them knew what they were doing in the same way very few people in the 1990s knew what they were doing.  Ignorance creates the largest bubbles.

In short, they did not know tech was overvalued in the late 1990s for the reason listed above."

It's because chess is very abstract and has very few moving pieces, 32 to be exact, with  very few strict rules compared to the real world. Can we instead of trying to fit AI to the current world, instead make current world more abstract with fewer moving parts? Yes, we can. We can destroy and remove all the other parts until we are left with 32 pieces, which AI can then control and maneuver in eternity way better than a human could. We could even have multitude of those boards and pieces, which many AI instances will play each other and eventually get even better. For evidence of AI's superiority, we could in some manner still leave few people whose only goal in life would be to practice and play chess, they would be confined to do just that, and everything else should be automatised.

The most challenging part to achieve that of course will be legal hurdles and many folks wouldn't accept a world like that which requires tremendous amounts of public convincing and eventually may even be impossible due to public being against such a thing."

Again, overall I know the glaring recommendation is stop messing with what I'm not familiar with, but would really like to get back $10k before exiting.  If you have the time and patience to listen to my buffoonery...

I was lucky owning AMC before the initial short squeeze. Gained $16k and sold!  I was only looking to buy and hold at that time but once something like that happens as a newbie it kind of sticks on your radar.  I attributed this gain to luck not just for myself but for most involved really combined with some greed being exploited. So after that and reading it was very unlikely to happen again as hedge funds would be more prepared... well that made a lot of sense to me. Then there were 2 quicks runs from around $9-12 range then back down  and I made about $650 each time in a just a couple days (shorting after $11.5 and covering around $9.50).

This third instance I was just going to to the same, was just looking for a little profit.. but it clearly hasn't worked out the same. And kept buying a little more as it went up. Then all of a sudden the price went from $18 a share to over $30 and I got nervous thinking of these claims of it going up over $100/share... so I cover 800 of the 1700 shares I was short at $34 last week on the spike up to $36 ...only to see it crash quick. Where then I was pissed I let fear set in as I'm never like that. I compared the price trends/graph on other squeezes and it looked to match other reversals... so then it made me think I was going no be missing out on all the continued prices drops that were to come and I was an idiot of paying $34 to cover and I should get those shorts back to at least recoup some of what I would have otherwise.... so re-shorted the 800 around $26..... only to go back over $32 shortly after, maximizing current losses in a few steps for nothing.

So now I've lost all my previous gains I made from owning on the first squeeze and a couple shorts a I did after... plus another $10k+. Maybe be even closer to $15k right now.  My idea was if I could just skip out on all this volatility and possibility of getting squeezed to oblivion and purchase 1000 shares to hedge if it keeps climbing... I can hold and let things play out and then when we're in a reversal downtrend then close out. 

My reason for not simply closing it is because I'd lose my short position and I do believe it's going to go down (although I know Reddit is probably not the best place to voice such thoughts without vitriol coming my way). The two previous other instances I shorted I'd say only 10% of my orders went though and I would have to sit there repeatedly trying to get an order to short to go through. If I close my shorts I could very well be not getting them back if everyone else sees its a reversal and want to short as well at that time... I would lose my ability to gain back what I'm down by just closing out now. 

No I don't have the ability to place options and looking at the application on Merrill Lunch it doesn't seem like I would qualify. 

IDK... I was even thinking of just closing everything out and hoping to regain some loses if there's still room to run, closing and buying 1000 perhaps... but boy would that suck if it went down... taking the loses only to buy and it turn out to be a downtrend. Seeing as I don't mind holding on to for awhile it seems the odds of the price going down are more likely than up. At least at some point where i can exit and reduce some of the loses. 

I do appreciate you taking the time to read and any advice. No this isn't my life savings or immediate funds I need to make ends meet, but part of it was vacation money. And I'm fine by missing vacation myself, but this is really making me feel like shit as it was more been taking about taking my gf somewhere for our two year anniversary and I've already done tons of planning... just haven't finalize bc of COIVD concerns. She's single mom whose deadbeat ex hasn't paid child support in the last year and serves a vaca too. Really upsets me the idea of not going after talking it up in the past few months... and although I'm sure I still will book the trip as a matter of principle.... I really shouldn't if I don't get back $10k on these 1700 shares. $7 drop would be a blessing. I was looking to so if there was some consult option on Merrill but it looks like on ongoing advisory service not a consult option. 

Anyway, thanks for listening and and or anyone who may have something helpful to offer, not simply pointing out the obvious fact I clearly made errors and shouldn't be messing with shorting."

First of all, you'll always have risk investing.  The way to minimize your downside is through education and research.  Use those methods to maximize the upside and lessen potential losses.

I'm sure you realize the strategy you describe has been tried by tens of thousands of people before you.  If it worked, we'd all be doing it.  Not intending to be negative or talk down, ( hell look at some of my recent posts on crappy trades I've made)  But if you want to give your idea a try.. do what some have suggested, and either do it on paper or play trade, or at least just use a handful of stocks to start.

I don't disagree fundementally with a lot of what you say(Mainly just the intensity tbh it's way too fatalistic, especially when concerning debt-gdp, people have been talking about that since I was in like the 5th grade and some 15 years later it has failed to make the ground fall out from beneath us.) but believe you are definitely blowing it out of proportion. It's unlikely any of what you say is going to knock the US off it's most influential spot in our lifetimes and honestly, pretty much impossible to completely knock the US down the similar influence of Japan. 

The UK for instance hasn't been the major world power in decades but are still absolutely a significant player on the world economic stage. 

>I'm not necessarily saying that there's going to be a permanent US market crash.

I don't think so either. 

All I'm saying is that **if** there is one you are fucked as will I and the entire world. Your international stocks are not going to help you as those are 110% going to crash too and we are all in for some **DEEP** shit if this does happen. Even if some of them make it alive the odds of you, a US citizen, keeping your job in the short term and being able to keep holding those stocks will be up in the air. High odds you will need to sell your shares possibly at a loss just to survive. It will be Great Depression Part 2 and the entire world will be significantly hurt by this most of all US citizens. You are fooling yourself if you believe having your money in international stocks is going to allow you to dodge this.

*If* this happens in our lifetimes I'm sorry to tell you that nothing except for maybe having a high 6-7 figure net worth being held between bonds and property and lots of comodities, and not entirely needing an active income to get by is going to help you get through it unscathed. In other words you want to pretty much have already made it and be done with needing to take significant risk in the volatility of the stock market international or not. Otherwise it's better to just accept you're going to have to pull up your pants, stare at some red and avg the fuck down, possibly move out of the country if it gets that bad, and accept you're going to be living rough for a while.

Which is again why I say that it's silly to even consider a scenario where the US stock market and economy does not recover as you will be in such deep shit that the markets are probably going to be the least of your concerns and there was nothing you really could have done differently."
2021-06-01 16:31:53,stocks,"You may be right, obviously if the US takes a hit that's not a good sign for the world, generally speaking. But I don't think you have to necessarily be apocalyptic to imagine a scenario in which other economies might come out ahead of the US.

2021-06-01 16:50:01,stocks,">  But I don't think you have to necessarily be apocalyptic to imagine a scenario in which other economies might come out ahead of the US.

After some time, sure, it's a given actually, but it would be completely unprecedented to have a situation where a major world power sees an economic collapse and the rest of the world doesn't in the short term.

However, the upside would not be felt by most *Americans* which is the important bit for you and I. As an American if this happens, unless you've already made it and don't have significant skin in the markets and no longer entirely need an active income you are screwed more than likely. A country's average populace is only as well off as the country itself, for instance, China was at one point the premier world power, and most of it's citizens did not enjoy the coming booms in other countries."
