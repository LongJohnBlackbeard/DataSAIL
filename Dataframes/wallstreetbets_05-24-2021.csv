2021-05-24 18:21:49,wallstreetbets,Risking 9k to make a sketchy 1k doesn’t seem like a great idea
2021-05-24 18:38:06,wallstreetbets,Try again when you diamond hand to gains that meet the rules. Or they expire worthless.
2021-05-24 18:38:37,wallstreetbets,Congrats on the gainz bro

2021-05-24 18:23:40,wallstreetbets,"9k is the equity but with that he should be atleast at 40% - 4K for the week. Debit spreads are the way to go, minimize loss but get bigger profits"

2021-05-24 18:27:29,wallstreetbets,So you’d rather risk 10k to make 1k vs take advice and risk 5k to make atleast 3k just using the 5k...
2021-05-24 18:28:52,wallstreetbets,Look buddy do your own thing i dont need advice from you o do this shit with ease

2021-05-24 18:29:22,wallstreetbets,Q3 EPS projected to be almost 4x what last quarters earnings were. From .03 to .11- I'm just going a little longer at a little higher of a strike than you.
2021-05-24 18:37:19,wallstreetbets,"Hey man

2021-05-24 18:38:49,wallstreetbets,"Thanks! I’m not too worried this thing moves slow, I’m out of the money, and no matter what good news comes out, it doesn’t move. So I’m fucked either way."
2021-05-24 18:55:01,wallstreetbets,That’s nice.
2021-05-24 18:32:55,wallstreetbets,"Same same, but different."
2021-05-24 18:36:58,wallstreetbets,"Don’t forget the deleveraging and paying off of debt, the wind farm contract, the aviation contract, the pick up in airline travel, the 5G contract, the new engine, there’s a lot of new upside."
2021-05-24 18:47:02,wallstreetbets,"Don't forget? I didn't know until you just told me. I've never even seen GEs stock price until this post. I typed in GE stock price, clicked on MarketWatch, saw current and projected EPS and decided to follow you to bankruptcy.

My brain is quite smooth as well.

Moratorium on Covid protected mortgages expires on June 30th. I'm considering opening up a 10% portfolio short yolo on that as well. Spy at 420 rn I think it'll hit sub 400 on fear/uncertainty."
2021-05-24 18:41:23,wallstreetbets,Get off RH. They'll fuck you like they did everyone else in Jan.
2021-05-24 18:45:23,wallstreetbets,If you liked the stock you wouldn't be buying it on robinghood 🙄
2021-05-24 18:36:45,wallstreetbets,"Honestly

I hate it

But the GME chart is starting to look bullish AF right now

2021-05-24 19:24:11,wallstreetbets,For everyone concerned about me buying on RH...I know but I’ll for sure leave after this whole gme fiasco....don’t forget RH wasn’t the only one who restricted GME buy during Jan :) have a good day young kings/queens
2021-05-24 19:32:12,wallstreetbets,"Sure, but you don't see me recommending those brokers either. RH has a track record:

March 2020: RH ""crashed"" and failed many users who had bought SPY Puts.

May 2021: RH ""crashed"" virtual coin trading during the doggy run and dip TWICE, preventing both buying and selling.

Finally, the PFOF business model ensures you will never buy low and you will never sell high.

But hey, commission free! At least they're using lube."
2021-05-24 19:35:34,wallstreetbets,"Lmao good point, I like that they go in with lube at least...they seem very caring"
2021-05-24 19:38:07,wallstreetbets,They're pretty too. Best UI of the bunch.
2021-05-24 18:29:45,wallstreetbets,"Looking good. I thought we see some pullback as well tomorrow possibly.

Made a killing on a 406C I closed, opened a 415C earlier in the day.

Cheers dude"
2021-05-24 19:39:10,wallstreetbets,"I love it when you talk bullish like that jd. A retest at 418 tomorrow would be great, imo, give us a strong start going into June."

Play I got

selling my 420 Put tomorrow and buying a 420 call and waiting for the days ATH and buying the dip, thanks friend!"
2021-05-24 19:51:46,wallstreetbets,Great DD. Closed my calls today up another 14% overall today. Looking for a dip in the morning then thinking we see ATH as well.

2021-05-24 18:04:26,wallstreetbets,"Good stuff as always 🙏🏼
Do have you ask you, how you would play rest of the week? Normally before a holiday weekend, we tend to see a rally in the markets so does it make sense to get Calls for Friday even if we see a dip down to 418 tomorrow?"
2021-05-24 18:05:43,wallstreetbets,"Ty for the TA.  Wish my wife’s boyfriends wife gave me some T&A this good.

2021-05-24 18:03:58,wallstreetbets,"I am slowly building a Jan 2023 NIO position at $55.  Still under $5 per contract on some days, but rising.  Leaps are the ticket for Nio, esp when it is beat up this badly.  

As soon as the chip shortage ends there is going to be an ugly battle for EV dominance imho.  Nio is positioned to be #2 or #3 for EVs in the Chinese market by 2022/2023 and that is good enough for me.  

I'd hold those shares."

2021-05-24 17:02:47,wallstreetbets,Went from 7k to 40k using the ol wheel. Problem is when you get left bag holding a company for 6 months and the premiums get crushed on CC.

2021-05-24 17:03:42,wallstreetbets,I don't mind holding BNGO. Like I said I believe in the company.
2021-05-24 19:22:49,wallstreetbets,Which company was that? Are you still wheeling?
2021-05-24 18:14:39,wallstreetbets,If only I had $1M....

2021-05-24 17:07:48,wallstreetbets,"Yea i know the feeling, been getting bent offer and pounded with a finger in my ass by PLTR the past 3 months. Made atleast 10k on premiums so I’m going down about 25% , if it ever hits $28 and i “break even” I’ll actually be up around 15k off premiums


If i would of just held cash I’d be able to not pay capital gains tax on the premium profit and not be down on the position. So yea I’m all good but the wheel is definitely not a “ win , win” situation"
2021-05-24 17:51:07,wallstreetbets,What’s your timeframe and price target for BNGO? I hold shares as well and have sold my first round of CC which expired worthless last Friday. Will open a new CC position this week. Missed selling the CC this morning when the price peaked early.

I am talking Spy 450 and Nasdaq 14500 being a possibility. One last hurrah before the increasing expected Taper talk in the June FOMC. I think in the June FOMC JPOW finally will come out and say that they will consider tapering months later, when they expect economy to pick up and get back. JPOW talking about tapering will be big deal and the market will react. So far JPOW has been like: yeah, now is not the time to even talk about tapering. But at the back end, they have taking measures to tighten - like increasing Reverse Repo exchanges. Anyway, that's just my theory. And I have been wrong a lot of times. 😅🤠"

This is not just some random speculative boring pre revenue biomed stock that may or may not work. It's the fucking future and VG is one of the first to create and enter a new industry. And I will support them as best I can with the money I have.

He does this through his own personal opinion, but he has a very good track record. I have read his books and I have watched his show. He’s very entertaining to watch but he gets a little on your nerves sometimes. He yells at his guests a lot, but he is very knowledgeable. He is a good guy, and I would say that he is a leader.

The market went green today so naturally, TSLA went green as well. If the market goes red, TSLA will quickly go back down to $590 range. It all depends on if anything scary happens this week such as inflation news or if Powell scares investors again with any updates on interest or inflation news. That guy who shorted TSLA millions last week must be scared when he saw TSLA go up today"

2021-05-24 19:30:49,wallstreetbets,Keep in mind: their definition of a straddle isn’t an options trader’s definition of a straddle.  Basically it’s just about the fact that an entire trade has to be completed or unwound without any wash sales (repurchase of contracts within 30 days) to calculate and claim a loss. It’s actually the same as you’d account in your P&Ls for a trade.

2021-05-24 17:45:03,wallstreetbets,"Because it's hard to see irrational people thinking it's gonna squeeze when the company is in really bad shape and has diluted it's stock over 400% since before covid. And every negative news gets rurned into a positive by holders. Here's the truth: They introduced the vote for 500m new shared because they needed them to survive long term, it wasn't some 4d chess move. The CEO went on youtube to make people change their votes, not to support ""apes"". They removed the proposal and postponed the shareholder meeting because they could see the vote wouldn't go in their favor. Wouldn't surprise me if they reintroduced a new but smaller dilution proposal with the new proxy. The company is in worse condition than ever before yet is trading at all time highs adjusting for dilution yet people keep buying in thinking it will squeeze to 100k or more. It's  a ponzi scheme and it's hard to watch."
2021-05-24 17:36:09,wallstreetbets,Lol I upvoted you. They are mad they missed amc. Qmc traded 4-6 all pandemic. They fell to 2$ on bankrupcy news. 3$ the next day and I took 50 percent profits. Then back to pandemic 6 soon to be 14-22 prepandemic. But then this whole meme stock thing. They mad they saw amc for 2$ in december or january

2021-05-24 17:42:23,wallstreetbets,"wow it looks like OP bought newly offered contracts with barely any open interest (the 12/17's and 7/16's at least). He's 10% of the OI for this one, and half the OI for the 7/16's LOL. He's either UVXY burry or 110% tard."
2021-05-24 17:24:53,wallstreetbets,He made this bet most likely not knowing bout the reverse split. I highly doubt he has an exit strategy.
2021-05-24 15:53:47,wallstreetbets,VALE is the fuck up here. They are the reason why it’s trading at a discount and will keep trading at a discount.
2021-05-24 16:00:24,wallstreetbets,"$VALE has exactly the same pattern. It has tanked since may 13th. Sectorial moves. Unlike $VALE that moves because of hype, $TRQ actually delivers what they actually say they will deliver, thus the change in guidance( which is still 300% mining increase yoy)"

No hard feelings, just it is what it is. I will be seriously amazed if they have some convincing positive info to release or to answer the hard questions they will get. Was originally only going to buy $1K worth of puts, as I was hesitant but intellectually it just makes sense to me that the price will tumble. Maybe I am wrong and all of you make money instead. We will see."

2021-05-24 17:46:41,wallstreetbets,That it's a pipe dream that they'll be profitable.
2021-05-24 15:54:35,wallstreetbets,"I'm not sure how their making money, I could put my house on the market and get 10 offers over list in an hour. You loose money using open door for the convenience factor."
2021-05-24 16:32:21,wallstreetbets,They are hiring like a mofo too
2021-05-24 15:21:23,wallstreetbets,"Rocking and Rolling. I grabbed 30k warrants last week when they touched $4. Analyst consensus is $35 on OPEN, which implies a price point of $22-24 on OPENW. This will be a 4-5 bagger over the next 6-12 months. I'm in for the long haul."
2021-05-24 15:22:51,wallstreetbets,I have been a fan of Opendoor for a while. I do not think they're currently best suited for the housing market as it sits (because people want as much money as they can get for their home) but I believe that they are well suited to dominate the landscape going forward.
2021-05-24 15:31:12,wallstreetbets,They sent me a freaking flyer the other day. I am convinced this is such a shit company that it is puts for days.
2021-05-24 15:22:15,wallstreetbets,What would your stock PT be and when?
2021-05-24 17:05:05,wallstreetbets,"This sounds interesting, will do some more DD on this."
2021-05-24 17:13:20,wallstreetbets,Holy fucking deja vu
2021-05-24 15:17:17,wallstreetbets,$SPCE.
2021-05-24 17:04:42,wallstreetbets,Opendoor has a reputation in the industry for being a garbage company.
2021-05-24 16:52:10,wallstreetbets,$RDFN
2021-05-24 17:46:13,wallstreetbets,"I personally love opendoor. I think they have some tough sledding until the markets cool off since buyers are driving prices right now. I believe real estate is in for a major shake up and they will be well positioned for it. Talk to your realtors and ask them their thoughts on the ibuying model and opendoor, all the details you need"
2021-05-24 16:45:02,wallstreetbets,Yeah current RE market doesn’t bode well for OPEN.
2021-05-24 15:24:39,wallstreetbets,"I’m with you, I have a 3 year time horizon on this, will likely convert warrants to shares if they’d shoot up. Regardless, I think Opendoor is going to digitize the real estate transaction process. Their NPS is just too good, friends who have used really liked the experience"
2021-05-24 15:49:47,wallstreetbets,"I’m not a complete tard but I am retarded, can you just give me the basics of how warrants work?"
2021-05-24 15:29:58,wallstreetbets,"Can you elaborate on this? As a home seller, I would gladly trade off the 10% in fees I would pay for a traditional sale to use Opendoor's hassle free process. I would still net the same amount, but I wouldn't have to haggle over petty terms or deal with apes bringing their poop flinging offspring on a tour of my home every 20 minutes."
2021-05-24 15:58:14,wallstreetbets,"I called them when I sold a home and they were very nice and explained all the fees and the low ball offer and I said no thank you, ill take the over asking cash offer. Bye 👋"
2021-05-24 15:26:42,wallstreetbets,"I mean my PT is 30 within the next year, easy. Even if the market corrects, their CEO Eric Wu has been preparing for a market pullback for years, hence Opendoor’s large cash position. My perspective is they’re set up for success in both a bull or bear market"
2021-05-24 15:25:37,wallstreetbets,"Can you explain to me how market expansion will assist their business that loses money?

""We are going to burn through so much cash, no one home will be safe""

Legitimately how can't you make money in a fixed cost market with variable profit margins in **this** real estate economy?

Why are they losing money on any deal? To gain marketshare? Why would you want to lose on a deal to gain marketshare, how will that ever be profitable in 2-3 years?

""You guys gotta sell to open door, they are literally over paying.""

Adjusted EBITDA for next Q is potentially a loss, so they are going to have to take on more cash to fuel future growth, that is either coming from your wallet or the banks."
2021-05-24 15:30:56,wallstreetbets,"Do you know what the clause is on when / if they can recall the warrants early? I'd hold them until 2025 I possible, but assume they'll be called in at some point."
2021-05-24 16:36:49,wallstreetbets,It is a 5 year option call with a strike price of $11.50. But it trades under its own unique ticker (OPENW).
2021-05-24 15:34:30,wallstreetbets,"At the end of the day, the middle man is going to get paid. Opendoor operates by basically lowballing you. They are definitely not going to make offers beyond asking. In the current market where I live, you may need to 10-20% above asking to get a property. Opendoor is not going to do this. I also went to 1 Opendoor listing. Fucking horrible. The house is empty, that tends to be negative pressure. It was hot. Someone forgot to turn on the air. It smelled because of this. I know this is a trash concept company."
2021-05-24 15:32:57,wallstreetbets,"Because the real estate market is ""hot"" right now with people in some cases offering more than asking price within a week on the market, I don't think people are as receptive to take less to have a quick, no hassle process.

When the real estate market is less hot, and sellers don't have to deal with price negotiations or long on the market times it will be extremely more attractive to use Opendoor.

(I've had prior positions in it, but I don't have any right now)"
2021-05-24 16:10:04,wallstreetbets,What was their reasoning on the low ball offer?
2021-05-24 15:48:28,wallstreetbets,"According to the financials directly from their investor relations presentation from the last ER, the current average contribution margin on a home is +4% of the sale price. With a roadmap to increase this to 7% over the next 12-18 months through additional services. The only loss they are suffering is from expanding into new markets where it takes a few quarters to reach the same levels of maturity. Currently 90% of their markets are CM positive."
2021-05-24 17:11:53,wallstreetbets,So how is it different than an option? Are warrants affected by Greeks as options?
2021-05-24 17:04:54,wallstreetbets,"I think Opendoor will be more attractive, they will also eat more expenses by not being able to turn properties over rapidly. At the end of the day, their offers are going to have to be non-competitively low. Their customer base will likely be the desperate facing foreclosure."
2021-05-24 15:41:11,wallstreetbets,"Every second of the day, there is some dumb ape that yolo's on options and soon thereafter needs cash fast... The market is arguable the hottest seller's market in a decade, and Opendoor's sales numbers are still booming. The market will equalize soon once this pent up pandemic demand subsides and OPEN will continue to crush it."
2021-05-24 16:14:48,wallstreetbets,Not the same person: They need to make money. They basically need to buy low and sell high in sort of quick flip scenario. It is just high throughput home flipping without any of the major renovations. It is not a fancy platform. Everyone who is getting excited about this are basically excited about watching any shitty HGTV show about house flipping minus the drama of actually adding value to the property.
2021-05-24 15:52:03,wallstreetbets,"That's absolutely shocking to hear than 90% of their business is CF+ with a 4% GM, and they lost investors .48 cents per share last quarter. 

Do you understand how backwards that sounds? So their new market expansion just destroyed the entire company's financials?

10% of their entire business is essentially a tumor?"
2021-05-24 15:43:27,wallstreetbets,"Lol I am a fan of Opendoor, what I am saying is that it is attractive now but it will be even more attractive in the future."
2021-05-24 17:02:10,wallstreetbets,"yeah. its a really simple business model - they essentially buy distressed assets quickly and cheaply. Like say your family needs to split an estate or youre in a divorce and need to sell a house to split the assets... or you need cash fast cuz you owe robinhood margin call (lol), they offer fast cash for your property. no contingencies, etc. You accept a lower bid for an easy close. honestly, i expect that AFTER this housing boom and when people are underwater from exorbitantly overpriced mortgages, then they'll really reap the benefits."
2021-05-24 16:35:50,wallstreetbets,"sigh. Try looking a little deeper and you'll see that they are doubling the number of major metro areas by the end of the calendar year. I want to see a company with solid unit economics that reinvests 100% of the profit when they know they are the market leader of a huge disruption. So yeah, it makes total sense to me."
2021-05-24 17:06:59,wallstreetbets,"Even then, short sales are tough. They can't really afford to hold properties for extended periods as this kills their margin on sales. I think there will be an uptick for them, but I am not sure it will yield better returns."
2021-05-24 17:24:47,wallstreetbets,"ay. i hold about 300 shares and am sorta underwater. its a wash right now with all the options premium collected, but its gonna take time to see how this all plays out. any comparison to last year is not realistic though, since they literally shut down for covid and didnt buy or sell shit for a year. 2018 did not look terrible.... i dont expect any profit overall yet, but they are making a margin on a very competitive market with easy credit. ill hold for now."
2021-05-24 15:50:46,wallstreetbets,How does one buy calls on PLTR and profit from them?  Asking for a friend.
2021-05-24 17:58:12,wallstreetbets,"This was a brilliant move no doubt 

He entered the position between 2:03-2:04 pm ET and exited around 3:06-3:07 pm

The highest price of this contract was $0.5 and only 12 contracts were traded at that price. OP sold these between $0.48-0.49.

Congrats OP. This is exactly how I turned 33K into $289K in 4 months and then turned that $289K into $81K in one week! 

Probability is very high that you will blow this account very soon."

2021-05-24 15:11:54,wallstreetbets,"Lmao ""PrIcEd In"". Cries at $25 average."
2021-05-24 15:46:17,wallstreetbets,"Unlikely to happen because PLTR was not an ""interested party"" in the original solicitation nor remained an ""interested party"" (if previously was) at the inital contract award.  You can look up the definition of ""interested party"" in the FAR to understand what it means in the context of Government Contracting.  For PLTR to be in contention and have a piece of ""JEDI"", the DoD would have to cancel the requirement in its entirety and re-solicit the requirement that has to be vastly different from the original to mitiate legal ramification from MSFT & AMZN.  If this is to be the approach, the award will set back possibly at least 2 yrs based on how this procurement is progressing. Personnally, I wouldn't hold PLTR long term on this slim hope. This is a lame attempt to pump and dump your position bro."
2021-05-24 16:10:26,wallstreetbets,This is so fucking wrong on so many levels dawg. Pltr is not going to get anything from Jedi. Stop eating crayons.
2021-05-24 15:44:29,wallstreetbets,Uh nice
2021-05-24 18:40:29,wallstreetbets,"There's always a lawsuit for big contracts like this no matter who wins. It's part of the government contracting game. Usually ends up as a nothing burger. 

While I do believe there is merit in maybe breaking the contract up a bit more, I don't think the majority of these types of contracts are truly a one company gets all. 

Usually when awarded a massive contract, they are required to subcontract out a set amount of it to other companies. So it would be along the lines of msft +3 others. 

That being said, if pltr is to get any slice, it won't be directly. It'll probably be through IBM(if they can get in) They recently signed a true partnership with them for ai cloud stuff. Not like the superficial one they did for aws. 

From what I've seen from news, it's all  unsubstantiated and reads like sports media. Unamed player in the lockeroom rumor type articles. 

Marketing teams and in house lawyers doing business as usual. 

Tbh, if anyone has the clout to do the unlikely and screw msft out of this contract it will be Bezos. New hq in NoVa and owning the Washington post will be huge for him in the decades to come in the land of government contracting and political power. 

Pltr also doesn't have the right clearance for this particular contract if I remember correctly. 

I'm heavy pltr, but been in enough Rosslyn bars to know this is a pipe dream."
2021-05-24 16:59:08,wallstreetbets,Yeah but their employees can not be trusted… they have already turned the screws on their leadership from doing any government or military contracts.

> The deal would mark Amazon’s AMZN 1.57% second-largest acquisition in history, behind its $13.7 billion deal for Whole Foods in 2017, and highlight the premium that content is commanding as streaming wars force consolidation and drive bigger players to bulk up with assets that help them compete."

2021-05-24 14:04:51,wallstreetbets,They won’t be paying those Tesla owners a single penny. They will file an appeal and very likely win it as they were only found guilty by default as of now.

No judge has looked at the case and ""found"" Tesla ""guilty"" based on the merits - Tesla didn't file a defense yet, and this default ruling was automatic."

2021-05-24 19:28:54,wallstreetbets,Oh yeah bro that’s so practical. I think I’ll stick with my Honda because it’ll last longer than 6 years and won’t be throttled in any way to boot. Either you’re a sheep or your post was sarcasm and I sure hope it’s the latter.

As for the report itself I’m tired of seeing posts like this, news outlets seem to get the most clicks from posting bearish news in a never ending cycle"
2021-05-24 19:27:01,wallstreetbets,[removed]
2021-05-24 14:10:44,wallstreetbets,"That's probably the sum the plaintiffs asked for. It's a default judgement - also sometimes called ""automatic judgement"" in the US.

Apparently in Norway there's litigation advantage in filing the defense at the appellate stage."
2021-05-24 14:21:12,wallstreetbets,"Sorry about that, you are right. I edited my comment over to ""Electrek's bear-happy take"", as the title is theirs. 😎"
2021-05-24 18:21:42,wallstreetbets,"Haha edited your comment, toned it down and removed the swearing after I responded, classy."
2021-05-24 19:17:25,wallstreetbets,Wouldn't older batteries need more throttling to prolong their life? So wouldn't what you just said still make sense?
2021-05-24 17:42:19,wallstreetbets,Aren’t you a happy chappy
2021-05-24 18:16:50,wallstreetbets,"I DO NOT CONSENT TO BEING ARRESTED!  
THEREFORE WHAT YOU ARE DOING IS ILLEGAL AND I WILL SUE YOU!"
2021-05-24 19:30:10,wallstreetbets,Lol no it ain't. The fact Breivik is eligible for parole is pissing on the grave of his victims every 5 years.
2021-05-24 14:13:02,wallstreetbets,"Gotcha just curious I don’t know squat about this case other than the update was distributed to add longevity to battery life.
Seems a little steep to me on the fine given reduced range was a consequence of longer battery life overall"
2021-05-24 19:44:05,wallstreetbets,"Good thing we don’t base our legal system on outrage then :) Although he is a disgusting person, if we treated him differently in the eyes of the law then why even bother having a judicial system? 

Every person who is convicted; no matter the crime, should be eligible for parole. Life in prison is an inhumane sentence that shouldn’t exist as long as there’s a chance that a defendant is innocent. In Breivik’s case he’s obviously not innocent, but we should not bend the legal system just for him."
2021-05-24 19:53:14,wallstreetbets,"Eh, well I'm glad that the Oklahoman parents who had to bury their children in the OKC bombing are no longer paying money to keep their son's murderer alive. Can't say the same for someone who had to experience their child being gunned down like an animal by Brevik. 

Good thing the friends and family of the dead are paying taxes to ensue Breivik is well taken care with a nice flatscreen HDTV in his room though! Wouldn't want him to be uncomfortable as he counts down the days to his parole hearing!"
2021-05-24 13:52:49,wallstreetbets,if you want me to read your memes you're gonna have to pick a different weather lady

The reality is, this platform wouldn’t exist for a woman if it didn’t get this kind of attention."

2021-05-24 14:07:12,wallstreetbets,"I listened to an episode of Cramer last week, and yes I said episode because he's become nothing more then a character in a low grade soap opera. He talked about ""others"" lack of accountability when they represent something and then they don't accept responsibility for what they've said... I nearly puked listening to this nonsensically bullshit! He has become the biggest flip-flopper with ZERO degree of accountability with his position on a stock one day, and bashing just days later. It's time to final boycott this tool and pound him into the ground, or better yet, support a push for him being put on his on WALL OF SHAME!!!"

She finds out how much money he's actually making from streaming and sponserships (7+ digits a year) and demands a large cut of it because of her ""promotion"".

He shuts it down, ends the relationship, because fuck that.  To let her save face he claims the relationship ended mutally and he's going to ""focus on his career"".

Queue all the shit slingers claiming ""he dumped a 10/10 to play video games"" and I wouldn't be surprised if he linked the real reason himself.

At least, that's what I heard from a credible source, so take it with a grain of salt if you want."

2021-05-24 17:07:28,wallstreetbets,"Truer words have never been spoken haha.   


Back a few decades (and pounds and beers ago), I dated and fucked the prom queen for a few months. I didn't realize how fucking miserable I was until after we broke up a month or so before graduation.   


To this day, people I knew from back then always talk about how jealous they were of me. I just roll my eyes. No ass, no matter how hot it is, is worth your soul."
2021-05-24 17:14:44,wallstreetbets,Preach.
2021-05-24 16:57:46,wallstreetbets,a *single* girl is. Plenty of happily married hit chicks out there.

2021-05-24 15:44:35,wallstreetbets,Like a German car in more ways than one.
2021-05-24 16:28:50,wallstreetbets,And chances are that a guy who can pull her can also pull other hot girls. So if she was too much makes sense.
2021-05-24 15:03:29,wallstreetbets,There should be textbooks written about the Wisdom Wank.
2021-05-24 17:09:20,wallstreetbets,"Post nut clarity is completely underrated.   


After I banged my wife (GF at the time) for the first time, I realized: She isn't the hottest I've ever dated, but she's smart, wants kids, and the sex seems good. I think I'll marry this broad if we go a year with no major issues."

2021-05-24 16:21:18,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, she seems to be more focused on stock picks than weather."
2021-05-24 19:23:45,wallstreetbets,"Googled her name and the little sidebar bio listed her occupation as ""Mexican weather presenter"" which is probably a tad more accurate"

2021-05-24 18:45:07,wallstreetbets,Celebrated Thanksgiving at Shoney's with a bunch of truckers once after my great grandma forgot to actually cook the turkey. Their crayons were delicious.
2021-05-24 19:53:09,wallstreetbets,"I did a new years eve there once.

Dude shoveled an entire waffle down his gullet at midnight. It was dope."
2021-05-24 19:27:33,wallstreetbets,"Lol, give that with brother last year."

2021-05-24 17:48:47,wallstreetbets,Asking for a friend of course..
2021-05-24 17:05:59,wallstreetbets,This is the way.
2021-05-24 17:17:59,wallstreetbets,"You can do that in the states. Fly to brazil, go to the amazon, and get some uncontacted tribe pussy while tripping dick on ayahuasca"

2021-05-24 15:57:31,wallstreetbets,I’d fuck Doug Censor Martin before I’d fuck Yanet Garcia. Man’s sexy.
2021-05-24 16:49:40,wallstreetbets,Wouldn't be surprised if he just said that so people would stop roasting him on how he broke up with Yanet Garcia
2021-05-24 17:27:21,wallstreetbets,">I just roll my eyes. No ass, no matter how hot it is, is worth your soul.

hah, but you speak from experience, and they will never know that pain, so bear with them a bit.  Only a few men are lucky enough in high school or college to actually get to fuck the hotties and learn their bullshit."
2021-05-24 17:55:02,wallstreetbets,Preach it bro. 10’s come with 10 times the maintenance.
2021-05-24 19:29:57,wallstreetbets,That ass just might be worth my soul.
2021-05-24 16:39:30,wallstreetbets,More like an Italian (car).
2021-05-24 17:37:56,wallstreetbets,"Also like a car, the value depreciates over time."

2021-05-24 18:28:54,wallstreetbets,It’s a bot worth following!
2021-05-24 19:04:18,wallstreetbets,Kinda figured. Girls that hot don't generally do actual porn. They can either do regular modeling or get simps to give them money for what amount to modeling pics. Especially if she still does the weather gig or has a day job in general.
2021-05-24 19:05:02,wallstreetbets,And even if it’s mixed why the hell are so many of you throwing money at that site? You realize porn is free right? Better yet the real thing. Bags of sand
2021-05-24 19:43:31,wallstreetbets,"Oh my gourd.

Edit: I didn't know this was how karma farming worked. Just drop a real crowd pleaser. Should've been obvious!

2021-05-24 18:59:24,wallstreetbets,Taxation is theft. Our Job as people is not to pay any tax. Govt's job is to take my money by force. If someone is smarter than the govt and doesn't pay any tax. I see that as an absolute win.

2021-05-24 17:09:19,wallstreetbets,That’s even worse!
2021-05-24 18:09:28,wallstreetbets,So it’s worse than Bella Thorne’s OF
2021-05-24 19:21:22,wallstreetbets,Yea but they are fakes...
2021-05-24 18:08:57,wallstreetbets,This is the way.
2021-05-24 18:04:47,wallstreetbets,You sound like you know about this first hand. I'll take this advice.
2021-05-24 18:39:56,wallstreetbets,It’d have to be a real quick lay
2021-05-24 17:50:03,wallstreetbets,So THAT's why Mexico is always tinted yellow on TV...
2021-05-24 13:56:47,wallstreetbets,Oh boy. Good luck sir. This stock is has been a bitch lately
2021-05-24 15:06:51,wallstreetbets,BABA seems so undervalued but yet its stock movement has been so frustratingly limp ytd ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|facepalm)
2021-05-24 14:44:19,wallstreetbets,"This could be a great play, but it’s hard to say what positive catalysts there will be in the near-term. No one knows when the ANT IPO will happen, when the China/US tensions will make positive progress, etc...

A lot of upside, but impossible to tell when. I was in calls but sold for a 30% loss to switch into running the wheel since it has found strong support and has high IV.

The earnings reports will likely be bad news for the next few quarters as the anti trust regulations get implemented and compress their margins. JD/BIDU will likely deliver better alpha short-term."
2021-05-24 15:19:58,wallstreetbets,"Did something happen today/over the weekend to crush IV on this?

Just looking at the option chain and a bunch of 7/19 calls are down 15-20% today even though the stock is essentially flat"
2021-05-24 15:55:49,wallstreetbets,I sold my BABA position today after holding it for 2 months. Total position was only down \~10% but didnt feel that something significant was coming to park the money for another 2 months. I will probably be back but only when the cloud of darkness is lifted by the chinese govt
2021-05-24 17:45:03,wallstreetbets,I'm in the same war 80k in CALLS
2021-05-24 13:37:06,wallstreetbets,"Uh... buying two calls doesn't count as a yolo. You must be those stocktwits guys who parade about their 1000% gains, when they bought one contract instead of actually YOLOing."
2021-05-24 14:06:16,wallstreetbets,"Thanks, it’s been getting beat up"
2021-05-24 15:07:14,wallstreetbets,Wish me luck
2021-05-24 15:22:01,wallstreetbets,That’s why I jumped in looking at the IV. I’ve got a stop loss of the stock hits 205 again. I don’t expect that to happen. But I’m ready for the loss.
2021-05-24 18:12:32,wallstreetbets,I entered in Nov last year and sold this March for the same reason. Took at -15% L and just didn’t want to have that much capital in a slow mover.
2021-05-24 18:09:44,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-05-24 13:39:32,wallstreetbets,That’s 61 calls but close

You fucked up"
2021-05-24 14:20:17,wallstreetbets,"No. You’re not doing good because you have a $7 put and no one likes a 🌈 🐻

2021-05-24 14:24:07,wallstreetbets,Cash and some soon to expire options...I sold a call option and made $1100 which I promised I would buy my wife (not her boyfriend) a new phone
2021-05-24 13:27:22,wallstreetbets,No you are not. Are you a 🤡?

2021-05-24 14:24:47,wallstreetbets,Lets just say that 80% of my life's savings is in Richard Branson's hands...the rest is home equity
2021-05-24 15:17:46,wallstreetbets,"Uber acquired Postmates to gain access to the their exclusive merchant agreements. And knock out a competitor in the process. So yea, I would expect them to integrate the app, even if it was just on the back-end. That makes it more efficient than running two separate tech stacks and support, and HUGE cost savings. I am sure they priced in loss revenues from adjusting their delivery distances, but they will most likely make up for it in the cost savings by merging the apps.   


Plus, the value in Uber is the re-opening play. Once their rides business picks up, with a sustained Eats division, expect them to hit profitability by EOY. They shed off a lot of their moon-shots divisions, and have great investments on the balance sheets.   


Place your own bets retards, I am just another retard who is long on Uber."
2021-05-24 13:17:05,wallstreetbets,Is food delivery a fad? I mean when are people going to realize they are wasting a ton of money to be lazy? You could eat out 7 days a week pickin it up yourself for the same price it costs to have it delivered 3 days a week. Plus you don't have to let more strangers handle your food then necessary.

2021-05-24 12:37:50,wallstreetbets,I drive Uber and prices are 3x right now. I'm making bank and Uber is too. Solo yeah ur wrong
2021-05-24 14:15:07,wallstreetbets,"""when are people going to realize they are wasting a ton of money to be lazy?""

 Consumerism is literally founded upon the principle that people will pay to be lazy."

2021-05-24 16:02:43,wallstreetbets,It's also cheaper to make your own food compared to fast foods. Lots of people don't know the prices of things and believe it's the same price.
2021-05-24 13:18:30,wallstreetbets,Uber loses money on every ride. Shit company.
2021-05-24 12:41:40,wallstreetbets,"Yep.  And they lowered their coverage area, didn't announce changes to delivery maps and completely cut off many rural locations.   (For the postmates customers) so what I'm saying is that they (Uber) will not get the revenue they had estimated, in fact I'm assuming they're going to have a down quarter that they explain with ""difficulties of integrating the two customer bases after the merger."""
2021-05-24 12:42:44,wallstreetbets,"That's one revenue stream, I'm talking about Ubereats/Postmates and the merger + price action that's now built into the shareprice.   Postmates was basically turned off for a large portion of ruralites living outside city centers."
2021-05-24 14:36:06,wallstreetbets,"Can confirm, am still lazy and stupid ordering doordash even after being vaccinated."
2021-05-24 14:46:26,wallstreetbets,"Sorry yeah, I assumed this was well known."
2021-05-24 12:43:30,wallstreetbets,That's what happens took out a competitor. So what. More.orders for them
2021-05-24 12:45:50,wallstreetbets,Uber eats does not have the same coverage algorithm it is a subset (smaller group) than Postmates one.  So they have literally decided not to service a huge portion of the customers that were contributing to their revenue numbers.  The numbers they use to sell their company to shareholders... I.. are we really in WSB?
2021-05-24 12:48:55,wallstreetbets,There is high demand 24/7
2021-05-24 12:47:40,wallstreetbets,Who cares uber making bank right now huge demand for food and rides now expanding to packages and convenience stores.
2021-05-24 12:51:00,wallstreetbets,"That's the only thing I mentioned in my DD that might push the numbers up (uplift) so... yeah I agree, but the point is they got shareprice action with the merger based on assumed revenue increases.

I am saying that will not happen since they basically turned the app off for a large portion of their customers for an entire month with no support.  If you're holding Uber shares at the current price, they will probably go down."
2021-05-24 12:53:02,wallstreetbets,"Yes & Thank you

I'm now all in on Ubereats"
2021-05-24 12:59:01,wallstreetbets,"Good luck to you.  I'm just convinced with the opposite given the number of people left without any way to use their service: Postmates gets deleted in a week, and Ubereats is still restricted to a tiny radius.    


Rural Americans I believe won't get serviced for at least another quarter and revenue won't catch up until at least after earnings if that's the case."
2021-05-24 18:16:53,wallstreetbets,So calls on SPY because market is rigged. Got it.

2021-05-24 19:52:06,wallstreetbets,"OP posted the following as a response to the question of how this ends  


""There are different possible scenarios. One is that the economy zooms into a positive spiral of fast-tracked economic growth, other possibilities are not so rosy, like runaway inflation leading into a a rapid economic contraction and eventually a recession. This time though in an abrupt boom and sudden busy manner. Another scenario is multiple bubbles forming in the economy covering different sectors, Eg., real estate, mortgage loans, consumer credit, etc. then default rates accelerating as interest rates spike, followed by a liquidity and credit crunch that would lead the country into a recession as well. Every possible outcome will be greatly exacerbated though proportionally to the gargantuan excess of artificial liquidity we are under right now.""

&#x200B;

Also found another article that tries to explain that the reverse repos are actually a reversal of the QE the Fed is doing with their other hand.

2021-05-24 12:41:25,wallstreetbets,"Meh, we’re fucked. The Fed is backed into a corner. Can’t raise rates. Can’t stop printing. 
Either/or massive inflation and economic implosion seem the likely outcome.
I’m all in cash for the moment until we see what comes of all this."
2021-05-24 16:12:46,wallstreetbets,"When the market first crashes the normie news media will not cover it until it hits its first bottom. At that point they'll start talking about how the apocalypse is upon us. When this first happens, buy the dip and ride the bounce. Once the normie news declares crisis averted, sell everything, watch the carnage unfold in the markets, and prepare your home for zombie attacks.

The stock market is a leading indicator of the real economy, so 6 months after the big crash you can expect to lose your job at wendies. When this happens go full retard, I know you never go full retard, but when you're looking at fully retarded valuations your own retardedness will be perfectly cancelled out. This day only comes around once every 7 years give or take and is usually accompanied by a small breakout to the downside in gold.

You'll be treated like the biggest idiot at first, but when the market is up 300% they'll all just try to change the subject whenever you bring it up. So you need to keep rubbing it in.

This advice is perfect for early 2007."
2021-05-24 13:02:32,wallstreetbets,"Because I see no better choice short of investing it in a business idea, an enterprise or even real estate, all of which are in the entrepreneurial spectrum, a realm where not everyone is willing or even well enough versed to take.    

Two considerations on the entrepreneurial angle:
1) Entrepreneur definition: the one who asumes (takes on) the risks of business.
2) It takes 10,000 man hours (assuming one has the aptitude/talent for it) to master anything in life."

2021-05-24 18:14:05,wallstreetbets,"Why would you want to be holding cash during a period of massive inflation? The fed isn't going to acknowledge it until 6 months after it's at it's worst, either."

2021-05-24 12:59:59,wallstreetbets,"Because I’m undecided on my next move. 
Analysis paralysis. I’m not as much of a degenerate as some of these guys.

2021-05-24 16:11:45,wallstreetbets,"Where are we supposed to go to preserve wealth? 

My concern for equities is if the Fed starts to taper QE, are we going to get another taper tantrum like in 2018? 
Inflation isn’t the only risk right now. There are lots of ways this can play out, and us retail investors will be the last to know"
2021-05-24 13:52:12,wallstreetbets,IMO something nobody is talking about is that the banks are drowning in cash and they’re parking it in... wait for it... 0% yield bonds? WTF? Why not park it in equities? Unless... they see equities as below 0% yield?
2021-05-24 13:12:43,wallstreetbets,"I couldn't agree more.  We are well and truly fucked.  I'm not sure what to do either so I'm trying to do a little bit of everything.
The real question as I see it is; are we fucked 1980 style where the prime rate was 20%. Or are we fucked 2008-9 style where Bank of America went from $60 to $2. I honestly don't know."
2021-05-24 13:56:36,wallstreetbets,Also why tf would banks park their excess cash in 0% bonds unless they felt equities markets were riskier than not making any money. It’s bright as day if you ask me.

At least we aren’t the only country with financial problems. Pretty much everyone is in the same boat.

2021-05-24 15:14:56,wallstreetbets,Banks are restricted in what they can do with their excess funds especially with regard to equity investments .
2021-05-24 15:44:04,wallstreetbets,Surely something is seeing less investment though? The sudden spike in overnight reverse repos at extraordinarily low rates tells me banks are voluntarily taking the guarantee that their money doesn’t depreciate over some alternative investment. Where was the money parked previously?
2021-05-24 15:19:25,wallstreetbets,"But if interest rates go up, inflation would probably go up.  Leading to an insane budget deficit in debt service, SS cost of living adjustments, and a million other things. That's why they are lying to us about the CPI PPI numbers so the COLA doesn't go up."

Right now there is more demand than supply so they are charging premiums to those that want it now.

Also its not the millionaire that buys the ticket, its the millionaire and family. Don't forget corporate purchases, a lot of companies are already buying box seats or season passes for clients as a way to win business.

They're also going to charge 600K per seat for institutional research/astronaut training."

2021-05-24 19:18:11,wallstreetbets,"No not at all. During the earnings call two weeks ago they announced that they would be announcing in the next week if their Eve mothership required preventive maintenance earlier than anticipated (originally slated for the fall). On Thursday last week they announced an all clear and set the Saturday flight date, which saw the stock shoot from it's battered down price of $16 to $21 at EOD Friday.

In other words, if you had a lot of guts or blind faith it was *unbelievably easy* to buy at $16 last week and sell at $27 today. I just wish I'd bought more but I didn't go all in just in case they did delay for maintenance or aborted in flight again.

As far as where it's going, the best idea I've heard is related to the founder. Richard Branson is supposed to take a flight into space this year and somebody on here suggested he might go for his birthday, July 18. It's by no means a guarantee but would make for some huge headlines and a giant leap in stock price"

Don't think a bearish breakout likely considering the increasing cost of housing and the CEOs recent humanitarian awards. Already a bullish pattern today.

RSI close to 50 as welll, which in a steady uptrend has been shown to be a better indicator of the shares being oversold. TMHC just broke out of its pre-covid high of $28, which happens to be near the most recent support level.

Plan to set my stop loss at $26 and a limit sell at $32.50 for the next month.  Very bullish.

Still close to 75% of the rigs and frac spreads in the US are idle and they will ramp up supply like crazy if the price goes over $70.

I’ve been holding HEP for a few years though, the dividends are great. Since it’s a midstream play I don’t think we need oil to get that high for it to get back to $30. But I hate filing taxes on a limited partnership, and it is not a long long term play for me so I’ll sell if it makes it over $30"

2021-05-24 15:17:17,wallstreetbets,"Trust, I remember, I think Buzzfeed may have been my homepage lmao 💀"
2021-05-24 13:35:12,wallstreetbets,I would short squeeze this guys stock in a yolo to the moon.
2021-05-24 16:49:53,wallstreetbets,">Wendy’s tendies out chere

But what DIP??!"
2021-05-24 17:21:04,wallstreetbets,Breadlines or Bentleys
2021-05-24 18:24:15,wallstreetbets,Sir this is an Arby's.
2021-05-24 15:40:32,wallstreetbets,"And then you keep buying the dip, until you buy your wife’s boyfriend and happily marry in Vegas."
2021-05-24 18:52:17,wallstreetbets,"motorboat them crevices, indeed."
2021-05-24 16:16:47,wallstreetbets,Make sure you like the stock though. And why aren't y'all selling calls to buy more on the dip. Need some FUCKING THETA GAINS!
2021-05-24 15:08:53,wallstreetbets,And why not a 3rd or a 4th credit card too!
2021-05-24 15:30:17,wallstreetbets,Fuck ibkr. Worst brokerage I've ever had.
2021-05-24 17:22:21,wallstreetbets,"Have you tried, I dunno, not being poor?"
2021-05-24 18:10:19,wallstreetbets,Maybe just pick your bootstraps from off the ground🤷‍♂️
2021-05-24 14:08:06,wallstreetbets,"Silly robot, how can he be holding the bag of something he never bought into?"
2021-05-24 18:21:23,wallstreetbets,"bro me be millionaire retard.....wife let me bang, even her poop shoot !!! I KING !!!"
2021-05-24 19:07:53,wallstreetbets,The free ketchup (aka tomorrow's breakfast)
2021-05-24 17:02:42,wallstreetbets,Onion mostly.
2021-05-24 16:25:22,wallstreetbets,"I tried that but got docked $5 cash advance fee, 23% interest, and had to pay off my full 2k balance at once or they'll keep charging high interest. :(

Would not recommend."
2021-05-24 16:29:41,wallstreetbets,"Agreed, but you can't beat their margin rates though (as a maple sucker). Questrade charges me 7% for usd loans..."
2021-05-24 15:06:13,wallstreetbets,thank you!
2021-05-24 17:51:50,wallstreetbets,Pfff you totally reject the American way of life!
2021-05-24 16:33:21,wallstreetbets,"Their margin rates are best in the industry. For everything else, they're expensive, slow, crummy, and overly-complex.

Their customer service is absolutely useless too. Five days to respond to a ticket with a non-answer."
2021-05-24 15:52:55,wallstreetbets,You are welcome. I will not stand for people being insulted by robots.
2021-05-24 16:43:17,wallstreetbets,"Haha, that's fast. I got a ticket that took them 3 weeks to respond. At least I learned how to use their portfolio balancer."
2021-05-24 17:52:11,wallstreetbets,"Humans are always right, they're the ones who built the robots."
2021-05-24 19:08:02,wallstreetbets,"A robot is only as right as its programming, and someone has programmed this one to do what is frankly the opposite of the job of a moderator."
2021-05-24 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,Where Do We Go From Here Apes? $SPCE 
2021-05-24 11:27:41,wallstreetbets,"We're going to be back at $60+ before end of June, and if Branson does fly in July we're gonna be in triple digits...."
2021-05-24 11:04:28,wallstreetbets,"Guys, I did not post it for bragging rights? Really where do we go from here?"
2021-05-24 10:54:31,wallstreetbets,More SPCE
2021-05-24 10:59:42,wallstreetbets,if it's good enough for a screenshot....
2021-05-24 10:58:48,wallstreetbets,Hold until July.  More news coming
2021-05-24 11:38:48,wallstreetbets,To the moon 🚀🌜 you retard 🖐️💎🤚
2021-05-24 11:29:18,wallstreetbets,This is what I'm buying until the price gets to $70 after that I'll just sit back and watch it keep rising. Once they land the first successful passenger flight the stock is going to explode.
2021-05-24 12:13:17,wallstreetbets,We Go To the Moon!
2021-05-24 11:01:14,wallstreetbets,To the sell button and buy something nice for your wife’s boyfriend.
2021-05-24 12:18:07,wallstreetbets,"Until end of summer - all test flights are scheduled to be completed by then. Should be minimum 100 bucks if all are successful 

Buy now or regret later"
2021-05-24 15:39:07,wallstreetbets,"Buy more SPCE, hop on the rocket guys!"
2021-05-24 13:20:24,wallstreetbets,to the spce!!!
2021-05-24 15:46:44,wallstreetbets,"Very nice asshole! 
We go to Buy more.
 🤲💎🚀"
2021-05-24 11:52:07,wallstreetbets,Lets go to 27$ and push the squeez
2021-05-24 12:10:16,wallstreetbets,We go to moon - that’s what SPCE does
2021-05-24 11:08:07,wallstreetbets,Yeah congrats and fuck you
2021-05-24 11:05:38,wallstreetbets,Holdddddd
2021-05-24 13:54:22,wallstreetbets,"You have to realize that this is not just for the wealthy.

But don't you think the average person is going to want to do this on their bucket list should they get the 6 months left to live meeting with their doctor?

I know I sure would be tempted."
2021-05-24 17:26:44,wallstreetbets,$30 by Monday....$45 by July......back to $60 by August
2021-05-24 17:58:46,wallstreetbets,If we see follow through of bull trend over the next two days we will see a short squeeze. Shorts are almost out of shares to borrow = no more manipulation ammo. Don't bet against the future.
2021-05-24 11:10:37,wallstreetbets,Spce has a loooooooong history of falling after a peak. I guess it’s why they call it “unrealized gains” lol it may drop but it will rise again. Buy low sell high. Rinse repeat until you’re too rich to post here lol
2021-05-24 11:34:31,wallstreetbets,AMC!!!!
2021-05-24 11:17:21,wallstreetbets,"It looks like a sell here my guy, as someone stated PLTR usually crashes after a successful run up, but your choice GL."
2021-05-24 11:37:26,wallstreetbets,"Sell some.
Then go on a vacation."
2021-05-24 10:56:03,wallstreetbets,Sell the news
2021-05-24 12:45:45,wallstreetbets,AMC. Wonda sold their position so now it’s all up to retailers to hold and repeat what happened to GME.
2021-05-24 10:54:52,wallstreetbets,Down lol. Puts gon print 😎
2021-05-24 11:12:25,wallstreetbets,Why are you posting if you didn’t close?
2021-05-24 16:16:59,wallstreetbets,Hi Kenny
2021-05-24 11:13:14,wallstreetbets,You should be waiting patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose
2021-05-24 12:36:42,wallstreetbets,"I bought in advance of launch last week.  got nice gains and friday bought a bunch of puts with portion of the gains, sold the stock this AM and holding the puts."
2021-05-24 13:46:57,wallstreetbets,Lol
2021-05-24 12:14:50,wallstreetbets,PUTS
2021-05-24 11:43:16,wallstreetbets,Dump it ASAP
2021-05-24 11:16:36,wallstreetbets,then its good enough to buy more! diamond hands!
2021-05-24 11:52:47,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-05-24 10:57:34,wallstreetbets,This. My shorts looking juicy already.
2021-05-24 11:18:05,wallstreetbets,Because I’m retard. I was born one and going to die one.
2021-05-24 12:38:40,wallstreetbets,"Mike, you are more advanced than me. But I think I’m going to get another 2000 S"
2021-05-24 10:59:04,wallstreetbets,Exactly. So the rocket goes up and doesn’t ‘splode......now what? Other than profit taking
2021-05-24 12:46:14,wallstreetbets,"go get ‘em, good luck.

i am a little surprised the reaction to a successful launch isn’t bigger, that was what made me take the $ and run."
2021-05-24 11:13:13,wallstreetbets,"bUt We Can TakE One PerSon To SpaCe!

Yeah, good luck with that. SpaceX do that shit every month and they ain't killed anyone yet.

SPCE is just a plaything for Branson. It's fun to have rockets when you're a billionaire, but it isn't a business at all."
2021-05-24 12:51:44,wallstreetbets,Same here. I was hoping / thinking double the Thursdays values by now.
2021-05-24 11:18:16,wallstreetbets,Y'all gon make me buy more shares
2021-05-24 11:18:17,wallstreetbets,But what if they sell tickets to celebs to go to space? Like an airplane ride but....where the journey is the destination.....? Airlines are super profitable right? Right?
2021-05-24 16:04:43,wallstreetbets,"hope you got that buy order in, i sold too soon... but the old never go broke with a profit mentality hit me."
2021-05-24 11:20:14,wallstreetbets,"But you can look at stars!

Ngl, I'd rather spend my money to go to Russia. You can fly around in their Mig29 fighter jets for a fraction of what a Virgin ticket would cost, and let's face it, it's a fucking fighter jet."
2021-05-24 12:40:05,wallstreetbets,"$250,000 per ticket and they have a few sold. But do the math on how many tickets must be sold to even get $1 a share in revenue (not profit).

Not saying the company doesn’t make it, just a long road to make any profit."
2021-05-24 11:22:29,wallstreetbets,And I bet the Mig is a whole lot safer too
2021-05-24 11:34:07,wallstreetbets,That says something :D
2021-05-24 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,AAPL breakout incoming? 
2021-05-24 10:49:47,wallstreetbets,joined 15m ago to draw a breakout? only on WSB
2021-05-24 11:42:36,wallstreetbets,I love that logic of “it’s at the bottom of the upward band so therefore it must shoot up to the top of that band” (3rd pic)
2021-05-24 10:51:08,wallstreetbets,No
2021-05-24 12:39:47,wallstreetbets,But the last AAPL tea-leaf reader said it was going to down! It's almost as if you guys are just making this shit up.
2021-05-24 10:50:30,wallstreetbets,Long view could see it... I think inflation gonna keep everything down
2021-05-24 10:56:08,wallstreetbets,"I hope for you: bought them at 134 thinking was a solid investment, after an up and down week I sold them at the same price, just in time to avoid losing 10$ per share."
2021-05-24 10:54:32,wallstreetbets,Let’s hope
2021-05-24 10:54:33,wallstreetbets,Yes but up or down?
2021-05-24 15:48:34,wallstreetbets,I see no break out Inc but hey I'd welcome one
2021-05-24 19:13:24,wallstreetbets,Nothing breaks out in 2021 me thinks
2021-05-24 10:56:47,wallstreetbets,RemindMe! 30 Days
2021-05-24 10:54:09,wallstreetbets,Long term inflation is stock market positive. Stocks will only come down if the ten year yield rises. Currently the federal reserve is purchasing $120 billion a month in bonds. Rates will remain low and the stock market will continue to rise.
2021-05-24 11:17:43,wallstreetbets,"Well they’re a solid investment if you were going to hold the shares for x amount of time like most people buying shares. Theyre not an over night get rich quick scheme.

Stocks dont just always go up..."
2021-05-24 10:57:16,wallstreetbets,Up
2021-05-24 15:59:34,wallstreetbets,What moves stock is where the top 10 funds that control 90% of all order flows puts their money in bro. These dumb ass lines don't mean anything.
2021-05-24 11:35:19,wallstreetbets,"I still see them a solid long investment, but I think we are going to face a crash anytime soon, and I think there will be a better entry point for it."
2021-05-24 13:59:03,wallstreetbets,They really aren't. They give a decent return. Best time I've noticed for me to invest is about late winter/early spring and then sell around September or the holiday season. They're a set and forget
2021-05-24 11:41:40,wallstreetbets,"I cant disagree with that. Thats why i never go “all in” 

Need money on hand to splurge amidst a crash"
2021-05-24 14:49:17,wallstreetbets,If you lost money buying apple shares. You’re probably retarded.
2021-05-24 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Update on my YOLO for $SPCE riding this 🚀 to the 🌝, and I'm not coming back down!!! "
2021-05-24 14:31:55,wallstreetbets,Update: Up over 1200 percent now!!
2021-05-24 10:43:12,wallstreetbets,"I'm thinking $30 by Friday is doable, and $45 before next Friday. I really think we will hear next week the next launch day which will be in June, and Branson will fly in July."
2021-05-24 10:44:28,wallstreetbets,"Someone made a good point this weekend that Richard Branson birthday is end of July so that's a really good target day for him to fly. So they need one more flight before he can go up, and that's gonna be sometime in June."
2021-05-24 11:59:01,wallstreetbets,remindme! 1 week
2021-05-24 16:07:15,wallstreetbets,"Up 1750 percent right now so I'm riding this bad boy as long as i can... Sure selling and taking Etsy i got now is okay, but if i sell, and price goes up over 30 a share that's gonna be worst than losing the few thousand i had in to begin with."
2021-05-24 10:34:02,wallstreetbets,How far do think it will go?
2021-05-24 11:59:23,wallstreetbets,I will be there to greet you.
2021-05-24 15:54:02,wallstreetbets,"Update: Up 1,750 percent!!!!"
2021-05-24 16:50:53,wallstreetbets,🌛
2021-05-24 12:12:59,wallstreetbets,Ape Strong Together
2021-05-24 15:38:08,wallstreetbets,Lets moon this thing!
2021-05-24 15:54:10,wallstreetbets,To the moon baby!!!!
2021-05-24 16:17:25,wallstreetbets,Is that you Kenny
2021-05-24 19:27:50,wallstreetbets,Seen this post pop up in my Google feed🥳🥳🥳
2021-05-24 10:50:33,wallstreetbets,Dump to 15$
2021-05-24 11:40:53,wallstreetbets,This is the way 🦍💎🙌
2021-05-24 16:56:42,wallstreetbets,Could be a little short squeeze coming on top on the move we seen today🤞🚀🌝💲
2021-05-24 13:43:19,wallstreetbets,"How much would one contract for 06/04 cost me? Im new to options but i want in on one contract. Where does it say how much i will pay today for the contract?

Im on fidelity btw if that helps"
2021-05-24 14:50:54,wallstreetbets,"I purchased 1 option call at 25.50 today that expires this week, I’ve made back $40 should I sell by  today or wait this week?"
2021-05-24 16:49:49,wallstreetbets,To-The-Moon! I'm up $13K so far....hopefully $30K by June
2021-05-24 19:38:58,wallstreetbets,So is SPCE a good call or will it be dropping soon?
2021-05-24 14:40:33,wallstreetbets,You should take profits and switch to puts.
2021-05-24 10:49:23,wallstreetbets,I agree late next week when all data has been analysed…. Assuming all went well we will get the next flight date.
2021-05-24 11:27:21,wallstreetbets,Richard Branson recently did a interview on Saturday where is said he is already going through the training to go up to Space.
2021-05-24 10:53:14,wallstreetbets,He just said he will be 601 in line he doesn’t want to skip the line
2021-05-24 10:46:19,wallstreetbets,If people understand that in 8 weeks it will rise for Branson's birthday and they don't have to sell immediately a lot
2021-05-24 10:36:40,wallstreetbets,Not very far.
2021-05-24 11:38:04,wallstreetbets,With a knife 🔪🩸
2021-05-24 14:29:15,wallstreetbets,"So it depends on what the current strike price point is when you buy. Let's say you want in at a strike of $2.00 then it will cost you 200 bucks per option you buy, since each contract is for 100 shares of that stock."
2021-05-24 15:55:13,wallstreetbets,The price is over that so kind as it keeps moving that direction you're option will expire in the money so you're gonna be golden holding on to it.
2021-05-24 16:56:07,wallstreetbets,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/virgin-galactic-short-sellers-primed-182058184.html
2021-05-24 15:56:17,wallstreetbets,Is that where the price is going to fall??? Yeah that's not happening unless they have an issue..
2021-05-24 11:55:06,wallstreetbets,"Yep! Really looking to see that happen on his birthday in July. Not sure the exact day, but fuck i can't recall the wife's exact day either😐😐😐 Shit gets me in trouble all the time😂😂"
2021-05-24 14:32:45,wallstreetbets,Ok and in this case the strike price for your 6/04 call was $1.06? Therefore $106 for that one contract? Sorry im just trying to understand
2021-05-24 19:19:06,wallstreetbets,Yeah....read this earlier today... I think this stock will change a lot of our lives forever
2021-05-24 16:02:16,wallstreetbets,"It won't go up forever, just saying"
2021-05-24 12:55:16,wallstreetbets,Think his bday is 7/18 if I remember correctly...(wow I need some more hobbies)
2021-05-24 14:39:36,wallstreetbets,"That's right yes! No worries i just recently started trying to get into options myself so i understand. The whole thing was like a foreign language to me at first, and i was really scared to try it. My first couple times however did not go well, but i just call it a learning curve. Now I'm starting to pick it up a little, and it seems to be going okay. As far as what you can lose goes is the initial investment. So if the option you buy guess to zero what you lose is the $106. If the contract goes up to say $10 though you'll be looking at making $1,000 off that $106... Greater risk, but also greater reward."
2021-05-24 16:31:35,wallstreetbets,"Yeah but i give it another 100% gains that would not be outlandish. It was at this level recently, and people back then were convinced its all a scam and that they would never fly. So this is far from over yer"
2021-05-24 14:31:21,wallstreetbets,His birthday being over the weekend is even more promising though considering they will fly on the weekend.
2021-05-24 14:30:31,wallstreetbets,So buying options that expire on the following week would be ideal so buy in for July 23!!🚀🌝🚀🌝
2021-05-24 14:43:19,wallstreetbets,Hell yea nice! Thats good good for you that youre getting the hang of it🙂 i hope to get there soon. Ok well if its 106 for just one contract i can shell out that much without too much worry 🙂 so on that contract you are betting that the stock price passes $27.5 by 06/04?
2021-05-24 19:10:08,wallstreetbets,"Bro, 1200% gains is where you cash out. Trust me."
2021-05-24 16:00:12,wallstreetbets,"Correct. So when it gets over 27.5 the contract price will go in the money. Let's say it gets to $40 before June 4th that would make my contracts worth about $12.50 each, which would get me about $50k.. I know that's best case scenario, but I'm gonna make money just not sure how much yet 💲💲💲💲💲🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🌝🌝🌝🌝🌝"
2021-05-24 17:14:52,wallstreetbets,"Mmmm i seeeee.. ok i get you. Thank you. I see today it closed out slightly below $27 but it looks promising.. thank you. One last question.. how much you profit, even on that example, depends a lot on the delta correct? And also somewhat dictates the price of the contract it seems"
2021-05-24 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,Big move this morning on USD/CNH 
2021-05-24 12:39:18,wallstreetbets,Which way did it move? To the CNH side?
2021-05-24 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,BACK IN BABY 
2021-05-24 11:56:55,wallstreetbets,Why would anyone ever leave?
2021-05-24 12:54:49,wallstreetbets,Congrats and welcome back and most importantly fuck you!
2021-05-24 12:41:36,wallstreetbets,Beautiful. Now transfer them to fidelity so vlad doesn't snatch your tendies!
2021-05-24 11:06:57,wallstreetbets,🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
2021-05-24 13:24:40,wallstreetbets,"This is the way.

Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in."
2021-05-24 11:26:31,wallstreetbets,They broke two resistance levels today.
2021-05-24 10:21:18,wallstreetbets,But why Robinhood?
2021-05-24 15:13:05,wallstreetbets,Paper handed and still using RH.  Let’s try and get up to retard level.
2021-05-24 12:58:49,wallstreetbets,Robinhood 🤦🏽‍♂️
2021-05-24 15:17:35,wallstreetbets,Back in?
2021-05-24 13:59:01,wallstreetbets,"Lol I did the same, but I’m a buy high sell low kinda guy."
2021-05-24 14:43:02,wallstreetbets,"7:11; 7:11, 7 even back do' lil' Jo....."
2021-05-24 12:32:12,wallstreetbets,Welcome aboard.. we will see $300 in June.
2021-05-24 10:40:28,wallstreetbets,Just finished transferring my position from cash app to jp Morgan chase account. So I can rest easier now... 😉
2021-05-24 13:40:03,wallstreetbets,Get off robinhood
2021-05-24 16:42:59,wallstreetbets,Fuck OP for Selling in the first place!
2021-05-24 14:01:58,wallstreetbets,Retard you are. The way this is 🚀🚀💰
2021-05-24 17:48:06,wallstreetbets,Chanting: Traitor

> **“To reach this objective, we are embarking on a multi-year effort that will lead to flights not once a month, or even once a week – but targets flying 400 flights per year per spaceport,” Colglazier said while discussing the company’s third quarter results on Thursday.**   
>  
>**UBS analyst Myles Walton highlighted that $1 billion in annual revenue and 400 flights per year implies a ticket price of about $400,000 for Virgin Galactic flights.** 

&#x200B;

We're talking about a company that only caters to the ultra wealthy, and has no other long-term prospects for launching anything but their own space tourist vehicle.  
They also currently have a 50% failure rating on achieving space flight.  
Please invest with caution!"
2021-05-24 10:41:00,wallstreetbets,"Did anyone see Space X satellites launch the other night? It was so cool! A train of 60 lights moving all in a row across the sky, thought I was seeing UFOs 🛸"
2021-05-24 10:33:23,wallstreetbets,"I would pay 400,000 to see space and I ain’t even wealthy hahaha"
2021-05-24 10:35:53,wallstreetbets,"It’s niche for now. Just like Tesla roadster gave birth to the model S and from there a full fleet etc. SPCE has to start some where and with tickets being out of reach to many, it makes sense knowing how expensive  the Space industry is. Eventually price should go down once they scale overtime. IMO Future looks good for SPCE… NASA contracts, potential to bring back supersonic flight and who knows maybe even getting into space mining in the future with nasa partnership. 

CERTAINLY AGREE HIGH RISK! High reward since SPACE X & Blue origin not public yet. 

NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE ✌️"

Invest with caution is the only thing that’s meaningful in this DD, and that’s with any company that has yet to generate revenue."

2021-05-24 10:56:54,wallstreetbets,"""But the company’s leadership has had discussions with other countries about setting up more spaceports around the world, including with Abu Dhabi, Italy, the United Kingdom, Australia and Sweden.""  


Well, they did say 400 flights ""per spaceport"" to generate that $1 billion, so the real question is ""How many spaceports are they expecting to have?"" They only have one right now, implying the $400k ticket price, but it would be substantially less per ticket if they're factoring-in 1, 2, or 5 additional spaceports to produce that amount of revenue.  


Regardless, this isn't a theme park where customers will return time and again. Even $67k for a 2- to 3-hour ride is a hefty one-and-done kind of adventure, even for those that can afford it. The novelty will wear off quickly and it only takes one accident to lay waste to the company for years, if not a decade. Nobody cares if Elon blows-up a satellite, but it will be a very different story if/when VG does the same with half a dozen passengers on board."

2021-05-24 15:11:07,wallstreetbets,"While you are right in some assumptions, this isn't their end goal. Their target is to bring down costs for each ticket down to 80 grand, just to compare that to a private jet flight which is roughly 30 grand. Alot of people can clearly afford that.

Their second goal (this is probably many years out though) is point to point travel in a concorde like plane (the tech they have entered a deal with rolls Royce to develop). Which would let you travel from i.e the US to Australia in less then 2 hours I believe?

We'll see where this is headed. But they're more plans on the table than just space tourism. Feel free to correct where I'm wrong. My memory is quite vague. But I red about it before I invested in virgin galactic a year ago"

2021-05-24 15:22:14,wallstreetbets,"Too many SPCE simps in this sub but VG has been promising tourist flights are a year away for over a decade now. If they had followed through with that 10 or even 5 years ago maybe it would have been worthwhile but SpaceX may be offering commercial flights on Starship in as little as 5 years. Why pay a quarter million for a plane flight to space when you can launch and land from a rocket for a few thousand? 

Not to mention the horrible revenue from Virgin over their entire lifetime. People are saying that Tesla had to sell the Roadster for a while before the Model 3, but Tesla wasn't bleeding orders of magnitudes more money than their revenue while they were doing it. IMO SPCE is purely a meme/hype stock and I wouldn't buy it at basically any price."

These guys are rich from the new big things, latest fashoin/trends,  etc. Old money is rich from boaring shit like owning castles and central banks. That's why nobody cares. 

Also it's very impractical to dream of becoming old money. Try starting up a central bank from your garage on pink sheets and see what happens. It's a tough dream to sell to young business entrepreneurs. So no one bothers talking about it."

2021-05-24 10:56:08,wallstreetbets,I believe there is a growth opportunity within the field. All the focus from politicians has been on corona the past year. To me that means that people are walking around at home with undiagnosed problems. Therefore I believe a spike is to come within a year.
2021-05-24 11:12:54,wallstreetbets,"That’s like asking how long is a piece of string?! CLOV is a good company with disrupting technology and strong fundamentals in a market in a downturn. If you believe in the company you buy now and hold regardless of the dips. If you don’t believe in your investment you didn’t do your own DD and bought in for the wrong reasons. I bought MSFT for under $50 5 years ago and held when people said I shouldn’t. I still own it and it has made me a ridiculous amount of money. I am not saying CLOV is MSFT by any means, but if you hold and don’t panic sell you will be rewarded. As for when, my crystal ball is broken, but I would bank on it sooner than later."

2021-05-24 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"BABA is likely to deliver 20% yearly returns for the next decade and beyond. Massively undervalued among tech megacaps, and ready to take off Value investing and long term holding might not be synonimum with wallstreetbets, but I don't care, because I want to get this stock as much attention as I can now that I hold it.

Alibaba is currently worth **$570B or $210 per share** and recently its price dropped after it missed profits in Q1, Jack Ma was lost and the news of the fine broke out. Plus, many people don't trust it because it's chinese, or because of its legal profit funnelling scheme through the Caymans, or simply becaus ethey hate the CCP. But this company has long term prospects that are stellar and financials to die for. Arguably, all the fear might be temporary , and during the last quarter, a lot of successful value investors like Charlie Munger have bought it around the 20-230$ zone. It's sure that it'll encounter competition in the future, but network effects are strong, and you have to understand that Alibaba not only is the ecommerce leader in some of the biggest emerging markets, but it is also the backbone on which the entire ecommerce sector relies. All the crap that you buy off Amazon is rebranded shit from Alibaba sold at a huge markup, and people have started to realize it.

**A 10 year and 20 year DCF intrinsic value analysis**

**Assumptions**: Starting FCF is the one from 2019, so we just out of caution we are not considering the ecommerce boom during the pandemic. The assumptions on FCF growth are based on forecasted CAGR for the ecommerce and the cloud businesses ove rthe next five years, weighted considering how much these sector weigh on Alibaba's revenue. After five years, the growth rates starts to decrese in my model. Terminal value is just $100B out of caution again, I chose this figure based on net cash and tangible assets on the balance sheet, it would likely be much higher. I assume no payout since they currently don't do any, but it shouldn't impact teh valuation massively. The discount rate is 3.63% which corresponds to the current 30 year yield on Chinese government bonds.

**10 year DCF value: roughly $1T or $367 per share**

**20 year DCF value: roughly $2.2T or $809 per share**

As you can see the margin of safety of this play is very large and there is potential for a multibagger in the long run. The forecasted 10 year return looks like it's going to be double the one of the FAANG stocks

**Some technical analysis**

Don't think I need to say anything here. It's pretty obvious that there could be a very sharp rebound from the trendline soon enough

Advice: don't play this short term or you'll get bruned, markets can stay irrational for a long time. Just hold shares, maybe with 2:1 leverage if you are brave. If you need to play options, go LEAPS for this one and it might make you a lot of money. Also: diverisify like an adult, China or the world could still implode tomorrow."
2021-05-24 10:21:52,wallstreetbets,Of course it seems undervalued if you use a bond rate to discount stock cash flows...
2021-05-24 10:20:32,wallstreetbets,"China has become very hard to predict. They did not let the IPO for ANT group take place for AliBaba because they feared it would be too large. Because of that, many investors are nervous to put money into a company that China is purposely making small due to ‘anti-competitiveness’ if Jack Ma dies tomorrow, then it might be ok to invest because Chinese officials hate Jack Ma due to his call out of the CCP. Many companies were allowed to continue growing because they play ball, but not Jack Ma."

2021-05-24 12:18:40,wallstreetbets,You need to do the cost of capital properly. This should include the cost of debt (what the company can borrow at) and the cost of equity (the compensation demanded by investors) bonds are worth a lot less than the market price IMO.
2021-05-24 18:17:14,wallstreetbets,Bro 30 year is not a proper discount rate. You can use a 10 year or 30 year (I prefer 10 year) for the RFR.
2021-05-24 10:42:32,wallstreetbets,"Lmao this\^

OP have you ever done a DCF before this in your life"
2021-05-24 16:08:13,wallstreetbets,"I use the 30 year bond yield because it fits my modelling style better. If you use CAPM you already bake in risk, while I discount at a lower rate but weight different outcomes based on probabilities. And btw, assuming the cashflows I projected were right, even a 20% rate would have made it a fair investment. The reality is that if the company was american the price would be a lot higher and people are baking in lots lf risk because it's chinese."

No, it was because ANT is generating risky loans and passing them onto the books of smaller, local chinese banks incapable of managing said risk.

Ant was  re-creating the conditions for a repeat of the same sort of “sub-prime” credit crisis that triggered the 2008 financial debacle in the U.S.  ala Bear Stearns."

2021-05-24 16:11:16,wallstreetbets,That's why I made a 10 year one. A 10y DCF is realistic
2021-05-24 09:59:12,wallstreetbets,"Yes it still is. The last thing China will do is let the CNY climb too high, they have no interest in doing so, because they don't have an internal service based economy. And besides, the US depends on Asia, exchange rate convenient or not, all the manufacturing of crap comes from there and the US cannot just create a masisve new industry from scratch. And even in the case of  high inflation, with the discount rate I used and with the margin of safety one has, it still is a good investment."

He legally has to hold them for a certain amount of time before he can exercise them.  When you exercise options that have a strike price lower then the current share price, that is a taxable event. Therefore, Karp sells some of his new exercised shares to pay for the tax on his options. Palantir by the way is extremely profitable and this is easily proven by looking at their margins on their q1 2021 report. If you don't count stock based comp then they would be profitable now.

2021-05-24 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"A DD on inflation, how it affects stock prices, and what it means for your investments! **Preamble:** The current jump in US consumer prices has understandably spooked investors. The current CPI numbers stand at 4.2 percent which is the highest they have been since Sep 2008 (the increase was almost 4x of what was expected). 

https://preview.redd.it/rj016ez2k2171.png?width=365&format=png&auto=webp&s=1442c59a2d4c3ec1bac1511e4482602fea7b779b

While it is definitely [questionable](https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/current-inflation-rates/) to showcase the annual inflation rates like how they have done here, the sudden rise in inflation that we are seeing currently can have serious long-term effects. To understand how increasing inflation can have detrimental effects on the market as a whole and the stock prices, first, we have to understand the basics of inflation. 

**What is inflation:** To put it simply, inflation can be considered as the rise in price of goods and services which in turn reduces the purchasing power of each unit of currency. As prices of products inflate, each unit of money undergoes a proportional drop in value. [Zimbabwe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation_in_Zimbabwe) is an extreme example (they had to print banknotes of 100 Billion) of what happens when a country does not control its inflation and goes into hyperinflation. A sudden rise in inflation can have an insidious effect on the economy: The raw material prices increase; consumers can purchase fewer goods, and revenue and profits of companies decline until a new equilibrium is reached.   

**Is it a serious concern among investors?** 

https://preview.redd.it/izi11ho4k2171.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=bcb3937bd948713d0212e5e160997ea135606f54

I analyze mentions and sentiment of various stocks to identify trending ones. I used the same data I collected to see the number of mentions of inflations and how it trends with S&P500. As expected, mentions of inflation have a negative correlation with how the market performs and we can see that it has exploded over the past few days. 

**How does inflation affect stock price?** 

The relationship between inflation and stock prices is not straightforward and no single rule applies. In the long run, shares can act as a hedge against inflation. i.e, the companies had enough time to adapt to the inflation in input prices and adjust their own prices, thereby increasing revenues and passing down the cost to consumers. 

But let’s be real here. None of us are interested in the long-term behavior and want to know the short-term impacts on stock prices. In general, stock prices have an inverse correlation (as can be observed from the chart above) – i.e, as inflation rises, stock prices fall. This can be attributed to multiple factors such as falling short-term revenue and profits, general economic slowdown, and a prospect of lowered real returns. But the single most important factor to consider for short-term stock price swings is interest rates.   

**Interest Rates** 

https://preview.redd.it/r3x8iy46k2171.png?width=594&format=png&auto=webp&s=c25e4c38b82564549d283e0da696d8b8cbe3c2c7

The U.S federal reserve interest rates have been near zero from the time pandemic hit the country. This caused the market to be on a massive bull run over the past year as there are no attractive alternative investments that can generate a respectable return. This, along with the massive Covid economic relief bills, channeled a massive amount into equities (bonds with almost no interest were not an attractive investment anymore)

https://preview.redd.it/zdqrr0u7k2171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=c297c21ae704ea4c8fb07da1d0b5fa57d6cedf8f

”Money printer go brrr” was not just a meme. 1/5th of all US currency in circulation was printed in the last year. Out of this, only a small portion went into the actual paychecks that people received and a vast majority was used for keeping companies afloat. While the Fed still hasn’t announced any concrete plans for an interest rate increase, it certainly is on cards if the inflation continues unabated. 

**What does it mean for my portfolio?**

Historical research indicates that during high inflation periods, growth stocks drop in price. This is predominantly because the valuation of the company is based on future expected cash flows and the increasing inflation rates will reduce the current value of the company, thereby adversely impacting the share price. 

https://preview.redd.it/3vg0lqm9k2171.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=f27c1616ad1560f271ff3a318b4ae301d434a626

Depending on where you believe our current economic cycle is, we have multiple options. If you think that the market is still in a recovery phase, you can still continue to invest in Growth stocks but if you believe that the market is overheated and inflation would be the final trigger for a slowdown then Value stocks, Commodities, and Real estate investment trusts can act as a good hedge against inflationary market changes. 

**Conclusion**

The short-term plays based on inflation entirely depends upon whether you believe the Fed’s explanation that the current jump is transitionary in nature and will settle down, or that the rising prices of consumer goods will finally force the Fed to increase their interest rates leading to the end of the bull run over the last one year. Whatever the case may be, we are in for some wild swings when the next inflation report comes out.

When inflation increases, those companies will see their effective revenue shrinking.

The K shaped recovery means we are currently very fractured: the wealtheir amongst us (most of here including anyone with money in stocks) have access to cheap capital that can handle interest rates going up. However, the poorer amongst us - just look at the median household income - will be hurt by rising interest rates and rising business costs since they're mostly likely those going to be hit by layoffs, etc.


The fed will insist that the inflation is transitory and won't raise rates until is absolutely has to. Politically, there's 0 appetite for doing this since it will hurt retirement funds. I think we'll print another few trillion later this year and kick the can down the road some more. 

One factor in labor positions not being filled is because the unemployment benefits for some people are a better financial situation than working minimum wage. Imo a better solution is raising the floor of minimum wage so employment income becomes attractive again."

What I will say is they have a very large short % and I wouldn’t be surprised to see bigger players trying to push it down to get out of their shorts/take the opposite side of the trade. I could also see them throwing downward pressure at the ticker change date to discourage short-term minded retail traders. They have held very well against those downward pressures the last week though, I could see that only amplifying when the vote is over and the ticker changes. 

All in all, I think the long term result will be the same for me."
2021-05-24 15:30:00,wallstreetbets,Apes would be excited to see the gama squeeze short thats going on right now. Buy GME buy AMC buy ipoe.... kinda has a ring to it
2021-05-24 14:27:39,wallstreetbets,Ohh boy it already took off hard. I'll wait for it to cool off.
2021-05-24 15:35:01,wallstreetbets,I wouldn’t be surprised to see many more mentions of it here and in general once the ticker finally changes. I think SoFi will be a monster in the future and until then I’m just going to keep selling CCs. As for squeezing everything in existence along with this still being a SPAC I think people have soured to that idea. But you’re right there’s still hungry apes out there wanting to eat up anything that has near term moon potential
2021-05-24 14:28:48,wallstreetbets,"Lol you missed the cool off period. It should be closer to 26 pre-merger, but because of the extended delay it has hovered between 15-18 for the last two months. Still huge runaway growth potential."
2021-05-24 14:31:21,wallstreetbets,It's fine. I know it'll cool off eventually at least back to $17 range. It's run too much to get in now. It's high risk to get in now. Low risk for you guys who got.in earlier.
2021-05-24 14:33:11,wallstreetbets,"I have been in since Jan, and it was a little painful through the period of it not merging, and it still feels undervalued rn."
2021-05-24 14:35:29,wallstreetbets,"I've plowed over $12K into pltr, sklz, CLOV, ddd, aone,bfly, iova & acic when the market was red. I don't think I have room to take a loss with ipoe. I wouldn't mind picking it up at $16 or $17 but close to $20?...nah."
2021-05-24 15:28:55,wallstreetbets,Pltr and ipoe/sofi are the best 2 in your list....

2021-05-24 15:12:29,wallstreetbets,What is the realistic value of GME? Does anyone think it will break 1K? Or is it a pipe dream?
2021-05-24 11:15:38,wallstreetbets,Wtf is this made up short ladder bullshit
2021-05-24 13:55:12,wallstreetbets,ape done fked up

2021-05-24 13:05:43,wallstreetbets,If only that mattered you’d be in a great position!
2021-05-24 15:33:34,wallstreetbets,"A short squeeze is totally disconnected from any fundamental value. When you short a stock you have to return the shares. So all the buying pressure will be coming from the hedge funds when they are forced to buy back shares that they borrowed. The problem is you're a hedgefund and you shorted more stocks than are available because you've always been able to do whatever you've wanted to with no consequences. But now the only shares available are owned by apes who are not selling which drives the price to the moon. That's the situation in a nutshell. 

Other short squeezes have occured with 20% short interest but GME is at least 140% but with the way the numbers are being fudged and hidden, I'm thinking it's actually 200-500%. Based on what comparable situations we have, there's no way this isn't touching 100's of thousands per share and I'm betting it goes into the millions. It's not about money anymore, it's about justice for the 2008 crash and other thievery. Apes are dead set on holding until every hedgefund involved in this circus is liquidated. That's why this is on a completely different level than any other squeeze in history."
2021-05-24 14:54:35,wallstreetbets,"Hedge funds don’t have any major regulations. They can do what they want, how they want, when they want short attacks included."
2021-05-24 14:05:08,wallstreetbets,Short ladder attacks are real.
2021-05-24 14:40:28,wallstreetbets,"Yep, apes are the ones getting fucked!"

2021-05-24 15:44:45,wallstreetbets,"I see the risk as very low because the company is transforming very rapidly thanks to Ryan Cohen's leadership. If somehow we are robbed of the squeeze, I still believe Gamestop will be worth current price or much better in the next two years so I will just hold on a little longer."

2021-05-24 15:48:20,wallstreetbets,🤟🏽😎 I am just trying to pick through all the hype and BS on GME and make a sound decision on if it is time to sell and get out or hold. I know all the “Diamond Hands” say hold but; some individuals would like to minimize losses and actually make a profit.
2021-05-24 12:12:53,wallstreetbets,Lemme get my shortest ladder ready 😈
2021-05-24 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,Inflation risks are priced into the market

2021-05-24 08:48:59,wallstreetbets,"“Discounted the worst financial effects by mid March...”. Should read, “Market was headed for great depression 2.0 and then the FED started printing.”.  It’s also funny, because no investor cares about inflation, it just makes stocks go up.  What they really care about is whether the fed will raise rates due to inflation."
2021-05-24 09:13:54,wallstreetbets,If inflation is the biggest risk we should be  very happy
2021-05-24 10:28:04,wallstreetbets,"If they were priced in gold would be 30k and silver 1k. I can't believe people are this blind. Fed can't ever raise rates. They will never unload their balance sheet. This will be the worst inflationary period the US has ever experienced, worse than the 1970s."
2021-05-24 13:28:44,wallstreetbets,"Current risks are always priced.

What will be the future risks are not priced. The risk can increase and that's not priced. Everyone is now talking about 5% inflation for a few years. Maybe in a year we'll talk about 10% inflation and that's not priced."
2021-05-24 09:45:58,wallstreetbets,My broker had the audacity to tell me it'll be fine because everyone has devalued their currency worse than the dollar so we're the best of the worst. Because everyone in the world doing poor financial practices has never ended badly before.

Gamma Index: Increased to 0.09 (future volatility is low.)

Vol Trigger: Increased to 415

Abs Gamma Strike: Unchanged (415) (above this level = lower volatility and a more stable stock price.)

Gamma Notional: Decreased to -367 (large negative gamma position implies higher volatility in the underlying.) (73% increases from 5/13 gamma notional)

Put Wall Support: Unchanged (410)

Call Wall Strike: Unchanged (410)

Gamma Tilt: Decreased to 0.89	(when decreasing it’s a bearish signal.)

Net Delta: Decreased to 185,208 (options market makers have a net decreasing long hedge.)

25d risk reversal: Increased to -0.08 (call demand)

Topp Abs Gamma Strikes: 	\[420, 415, 410, 400\]

From SpotGamma: ""In order for a breakout to manifest, we think that markets must hold that 4150 line and the Call Wall has to roll up to a higher strike from 4200. A break of 4150 likely leads to a quick test of the 4050.""

2021-05-24 10:51:43,wallstreetbets,"Today when I walked into my economics class I saw something I dread every time I close my eyes. Someone had brought their new gaming laptop to class. The Forklift he used to bring it was still running idle at the back. I started sweating as I sat down and gazed over at the 700lb beast that was his laptop. He had already reinforced his desk with steel support beams and was in the process of finding an outlet for a power cable thicker than Amy Schumer's thigh. I start shaking. I keep telling myself I'm going to be alright and that there's nothing to worry about. He somehow finds a fucking outlet. Tears are running down my cheeks as I send my last texts to my family saying I love them. The teacher starts the lecture, and the student turns his laptop on. The colored lights on his RGB Backlit keyboard flare to life like a nuclear flash, and a deep humming fills my ears and shakes my very soul. The entire city power grid goes dark. The classroom begins to shake as the massive fans begin to spin. In mere seconds my world has gone from vibrant life, to a dark, earth shattering void where my body is getting torn apart by the 150mph gale force winds and the 500 decibel groan of the cooling fans. As my body finally surrenders, I weep, as my school and my city go under. I fucking hate gaming laptops."

I have a friend who thinks this is going to moon like GME and is holding for $500. This June 2 shareholder and outstanding share count is not going to do what you expect it to do for you. Shares have quadrupled since the last time it was in the $30 range and they just issued more shares that haven't been accounted for. Save yourself a headache and lower your expectations here.

2021-05-24 11:07:31,wallstreetbets,"Their entire premise is flawed. The short interest on AMC isn't as high as they think it is and short traders have been booking profits lately with the movement. Plus a lot of the short interest is hedges on puts where they already booked the premium. Short sellers are not going to be margin called to buy from retarded retail owners if the stock jumps up to $40 or something for a day.

If retail keeps buying and no one sells they could in theory drive the price up to $40. But the catch is only a few percentage of them would ever get that if sold. And there will be \*a lot\* of bagholders left behind. I've got my popcorn ready for when this thing falls apart. :)"

You can if they have over 100% shorts, but yea obviously its much harder than with GME's low float. The turn over rate (according to ortex) says youre seriously underestimating the movement though"

Premiums are great and the volatility means you can always buy back at some point for less than you paid, or roll for a credit. Today is a great day to sell calls and buy back puts, if it behaves like normal it will probably go back down to $12 in a day or two."
2021-05-24 13:49:56,wallstreetbets,they stopped the GME rocket so we dont know the price it would have reached

2021-05-24 13:16:43,wallstreetbets,Look at op trying to cause did and division between the 2. This guy is blocked. Many of discuss the reason why Wanda did it and why it's good for AMC already. Op trying to remind and fud everyone holding like that rich guy on Twitter .

I think AMC could continue to grow. I do not see it hitting 500 a share just like I do not see GME hitting the 10m floor minimum that is being thrown about. There is extremely unlikely, and then there is unfeasible."
2021-05-24 06:52:03,wallstreetbets,Any time the price moves down a little everyone acts like a bunch of pussies. We had 8 days in row. Goes down 3 percent and we lose half volume.

2021-05-24 15:18:43,wallstreetbets,I’m curious why you think it is undervalued. If you look at the 5 year graph you can see the steady decline in price before the pandemic hit. Not to mention the last stock issuance that devalued it even more.

As with everything Reddit, no reason to be believe me so, no sweat.

The one thing you shouldn't doubt though, since it's provable ... AMC 422M shs float before latest 40M+ issue vs 57M shs float for GME."

2021-05-24 06:51:11,wallstreetbets,Close. He's just the one who pretends he's long on the stock.
2021-05-24 06:48:59,wallstreetbets,Blah blah blah..
2021-05-24 12:16:24,wallstreetbets,"Float # doesn't matter.  A stock's value is determined by how many people buy and hold it.  See: TSLA, which has way more shares than AMC.  (TSLA currently sitting at 774.81M shares and it's been up as high as $900 but currently at $598.)

Look, I don't know where AMC will eventually end up.  Even I doubt it could get to 100k-500k+, but I could see it at least getting up to 1K or higher easily.

If we want to play the numbers game of AMC vs GME, though, GME is currently at $186.52 a share vs. AMC's $13.69

If someone dropped $1000 into GME, they'd have 5.36 shares.  If someone dropped $1000 into AMC, they'd have 73.04 shares.

Let's just say we add the 43M shares into AMC, making it 491.29M shares vs GME's 57M float.    That means AMC has 8.61x shares in comparison to GME.

Let's compare, say if GME went to $10,000 and AMC went to ONLY $1,000.

Your $1000 invested into GME would net you $53,600.

Your $1000 invested into AMC would net you $73,040.

All pre-tax, of course.

Thus, right now, AMC looks to be the better play over GME no matter how you look at it, even if it's final stock value is 10x lower than GME in the end.  (Unless, of course, you got into GME before it went over $40.)"

Anyone who is interested or has a stake in the stock has already seen the Wanda post, though.  No point of linking it here as if the world doesn't already know about it.  Plus, there really is little benefit to anyone to listing someone's exit price other than to plant the seed of doubt to get people out sooner than they would have otherwise got out. Don't we already have multiple daily posts from Motley Fool for that?  Basically, everything about this post only exists to spread FUD.  Full stop.

2021-05-24 10:17:55,wallstreetbets,Whelp I stand corrected...I love the brand and really hope it survives.  But it’s overvalued. Let’s see leadership capitalize on the share price and make some moves.

2021-05-24 14:26:34,wallstreetbets,If you believe the official numbers than amc is looking better than gme right now. They continued to short amc when the ctb average was over 200% to protect their initial position.
2021-05-24 11:47:56,wallstreetbets,The case for the synthetics shares has been made. If you can dismantle it Im all ears. The ceo has said there are 3.2 million voters in the US and Canada alone. At $8-15 a vote its not hard to see how those voters can potentially own the float. One of AMC's biggest shorters and the guy who put a price target of $.01 just got the feds on his ass for naked shorting
2021-05-24 14:08:28,wallstreetbets,"Well done, retard is the way."
2021-05-24 16:21:11,wallstreetbets,"Do they have similar market caps? I'm too lazy to google it myself right now, but remember that if AMC has a larger market cap than Regal, then it might be very reasonable from a valuation perspective that they are not similarly priced.

2021-05-24 17:07:07,wallstreetbets,Amc market cap is currently the higest its ever been from what i can tell. So seeing as its valued higher than ever.... and it was failing pre pandemic.... i would like to know an honest case for why people think its undervalued as well.

2021-05-24 11:51:24,wallstreetbets,The basic problem with a squeeze is there just isn't enough short interest and is way too much volume. Recent AMC stock movement is all retail circle jerk driven.
2021-05-24 18:09:59,wallstreetbets,"From my very limited understanding of stocks, that means that even though Regal might have a higher price per share, it is NOT more valuable. Market cap is basically the companies valuation. So AMC , even at this price, is worth nearly double.

Also I'm not insinuating that amc won't go up, I don't hold either and have no idea how fair or unfair their valuations are :)"

Help him bc they definitely can. Yeah if he was saying that this particular stock isn’t going to squeeze bc it’s not shorted then that is a different more technical conversation. I think it was the first though"
2021-05-24 17:46:09,wallstreetbets,"Selling shares is a capital raise, yes, but at the expense of diluting stockholder equity.

It's *not* a good sign if you need to dilute shares to just simply operate your business."
2021-05-24 12:10:38,wallstreetbets,"Insurance companies have just dumped big money into increasing stock positions in amc by over 500% if that doesn’t tell you something then idkk what will. The fact that amc was basically doomed to fail is direct link to massive shorting because that’s what HF do. They target companies about to fail short them to death and reap the rewards , except this time the internet found out.  Amc  stock holding iisnt a long game hoping it increasing value to 20$ its a hold until share counts happen and the SEC steps in and forces them to cover their asses. Retail positions are huge and have left crumbs for them to recover securing the bag for us essentially. Citadel increased its positions by 163% which can only be assume  as a last minute scramble to try and cover some losses long term or to be used as a future tactic to drive the price down and shake the paper hands. There’s too many signs pointing to the moon to ignore at this point"

2021-05-24 14:34:03,wallstreetbets,"You most certainly did say SOMETHING about a GME squeeze.  You directly compared the possibility of one vs. AMC in the first sentence of your post.  ""Dudes, you can't squeeze a 422M shs float like you can a 57M shs float GME."""
2021-05-24 19:11:47,wallstreetbets,"If true probably means insurance companies are cashing in on the craziness by selling covered calls, something I've been doing for the last two months. :)

I don't think you understand how shorting works. They can't ""short AMC to death"" as a short sale has no effect on the companies financial outlook. The worst they can do is drive the stock price down. AMC is in trouble not because it was ""shorted"" but due to various business fundamentals. You are right in that retail threw them a lifeline by buying their debt in the form of share offerings. If not for retail buyers AMC would be bankrupt already. Now it most likely won't go bankrupt until mid 2022."
2021-05-24 15:51:20,wallstreetbets,"Quoting you:

""*coming on here to try and fake explain how GME* ***will squeeze*** *but not AMC*.""

""*You directly compared* ***the possibility of one...***""

Yes, I spoke about GME and compared why GME's **past** squeeze made sense based on its share float vs an anticipated squeeze for AMC with 8X the float.

I was speaking about the GME squeeze that already occurred and that we're all aware of.

Your comment suggests I'm saying GME *will* squeeze (future tense) again and am promoting that at the expense of AMC.

I am not talking about anything like that happening again for GME. Words matter."

$22.5c 5/28 - sold at open (+1200%)

$26.5c 6/4 - holding to see what happens

I assume that theta and IV would fuck the 5/28 calls from here on out no matter what, especially the OTM calls. Not sure if I should have just also sold the 6/4 call and waited to see about buying back after a drop. Was this a decent strategy?"

2021-05-24 12:10:44,wallstreetbets,"According to the ticker on Google's page, the QQQ launched in spring of 1999 at about $53. It peaked in early 2000 at over $111, and by the fall of 2002 it was under $22.  


If you're a long term investor, it doesn't matter very much at what point in that timeline you bought QQQ shares, because they'd be worth a fucking fortune today regardless.  


If you're a permabear buying puts in 1999 or 2000, it looks at first glance like the shorting opportunity of a lifetime. But you would've run into both psychological and solvency issues trying to short for that length of time. You would have continued to lose lots of money at an alarming rate, right up until the March 2000 peak. Then unless you timed your exit perfectly in mid April 2000, you would've got fucked by the dead cat bounce in September of 2000, and probably ran out of money to buy puts about that time and forced to become a prostitute selling $20 blowjobs in the alley over by Wendy's. But if you somehow held on and continued buying QQQ puts, you would've made a bunch of money on them eventually. Perhaps enough to almost break even on all your losses incurred since 1999.  


I'm not trying to make comparisons between then and now; I do think we're in a bubble, but it's not at all similar to the 2000 or 2008 ones and unlikely to play out in the same way. The takeaway is that speculative bubbles inflate over a long period of time, and when they do pop it can take months. You could be the next Burry, but more likely you will just get buried. So you basically have to wait until a downtrend is confirmed before buying puts. If you try to Nostradamus the market as if there will be a sudden rug pull during a time when the Fed is injecting $125 bil per month, you will have a bad time. And by you I mean me."

> Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard said Monday that the central bank is not yet ready to pull back on its aggressive monetary stimulus, but could be ready soon.

> “We’re not quite there yet, I think we will get there in the months ahead,” Bullard told Yahoo Finance in an exclusive interview.

> Bullard said vaccinations are bringing the economy “closer and closer” to pre-pandemic form, but said policymakers should not be too eager to pull back support yet.

> “I think there will come a time when we can talk more about changing the parameters of monetary policy, **I don’t think we should do it when we’re still in the pandemic,”** Bullard said.

> “We’ll see if the demand really flows through to a lasting increase in inflation or if this is just temporary,” Bullard said. **“I think it's mostly temporary** but then some of it will flow through to inflation expectations.”"

I see so many bears who still talk trash instead of cutting their losses. When you short a stock there is no limit to your losses.  You can lose more then you invested.

A 6.50 jump this morning and damn close to 90 bucks a stock that may 10th was trading for 64 bucks and people were saying it was overvalued THEN.

People need to stop thinking of RBLX as just a game and can't understand why it's so big, RBLX is the current minecraft/youtube/steam of younger kids and if it doesn't screw this is up it will have them locked in for decades.

 It's a platform that 'content' creators and streamers will use to get their stuff out to people who will in turn buy into roblox ingame currency to buy said content that those 'content' creators will cash out that currency but with fee's paid to the company to get paid in real money much like YouTube allowed people to monetize their videos but still got a cut.

Hell there is a video game studio ""Uplift Games"" now making Games just in Roblox after their breakout hit Adopt Me! became so popular that it's ingame numbers rivaled CS:GO and this is before Roblox moves onto even more kid friendly platforms like the Switch. I guess what I'm saying is I like this stock."

anyone got nothing else to do, try some DD.. ? place to start why not?

rare earths take a lot of processing.. that takes a lot of specialist equipment (for instance)   and specialist companies dealing with different products -  all the way along the supply chain from end to end

and without rare earth metals - available refined treated processed and used,  we don't have a civilization. that's the whole **SNEK** right there

got to be some money in that?"

Plus poor performance on automated driving, poor build quality, and higher prices relative to current competition.

I wouldn't expect to make much on it in 2021.

2021-05-24 09:06:27,wallstreetbets,"Are you joking. Weren’t they not gonna use lidar


“According to Tesla and Elon Musk, it's because LiDAR is expensive, redundant, unreliable. Tesla Cameras and its neural net computer can reconstruct a 3D world view around a Tesla vehicle, which makes LiDAR nonessential. Moreover, LiDAR-based autonomy depends on 3D HD maps, which makes scalability very challenging.”

2021-05-24 12:03:31,wallstreetbets,"Start selling covered calls with some of those shares. Ford has traded in like an $8-$15 channel since Jesus was in high school. You can get good premiums right now and there's a good chance that Ford keeps trading sideways because Ford NEVER moons.

I've been looking to spin up a theta wheel recently and F was one of the stocks I was going to play it with, juuuust before the EV announcement spiked the price way up."

2021-05-24 08:32:48,wallstreetbets,"Well... I guess it depends how you look at it. I was lucky enough to have bought in a long while back. Avg $18. Rode it all the way to the top ~$63.

No one is going to pay for a sub-orbital flight on a glorified airplane that can't even do test flights in a single year, when Blue Origin, SpaceX, or Rocket Lab will launch you into orbit for only marginally more money."

2021-05-24 11:20:47,wallstreetbets,I think people see Wanda leaving as a catalyst for no more share selling and also the dilution is now off the table. Wanda was selling all their share at $14-15 bucks last week that’s why the price dropped and the hedge funds covered a small amount at the same time. Regardless AMC is a reopen play with the US opening up again
2021-05-24 11:18:53,wallstreetbets,"Based on when this happened in March, it might hit mid 14, but won't get to 15. No one really knows. I thought it would tank today. 🤡"

2021-05-24 14:01:26,wallstreetbets,"puts definitely, wed maybe not...

try this: whenever spy has a major up/down swing, get a put/call for double the difference for 6 months out.

so spy has a big 3% gain -> get a put for 6% for 6 months out. set a limit sell order for 3x the price you paid. go outside and ride a bike or something"
2021-05-24 13:56:33,wallstreetbets,I thought Puts on thursday was the obvious play. So buy the shit out of some calls.

So, we are all fucked for tomorrow lol"
2021-05-24 10:56:13,wallstreetbets,I don't think that's true. With the volatility we've been seeing it seems likely to me that we'll see a reversal again by the end of the week. Maybe buy with that timescale in mind (or later) but holding to expiry in this environment is an excellent way to turn +100% into -100% instantly.
2021-05-24 07:34:25,wallstreetbets,futures are propaganda!
2021-05-24 12:04:08,wallstreetbets,Is it because x is an empty set?

We’re either very smart or very dumb."
2021-05-24 12:08:36,wallstreetbets,"It’s Russell paradox.  Y is the set of all sets x such that x is not an element of itself, then is y an element of y?  If it is, then it’s not, and if it’s not, then it is, contradiction.

Similar to how you’d show there’s no bijection between the naturals and their power set.  Let f be a map from the naturals to the power set of the naturals, and let A be the set of all natural numbers x such that x is not an element of f(x).  Obviously, A is in the power set.  Then, because f is a bijection, there exists some natural number y such that f(y)=A.  Now we ask, is y an element of A?  If y is not an element of A, then because A is the set of all those elements that are not an element of their image, y must be an element of A.  On the other hand, if y is an element of A, then y must not be an element of its image, and hence y must not be an element of A."
2021-05-24 08:17:31,wallstreetbets,"Awesome, I appreciate it."
2021-05-24 07:28:43,wallstreetbets,"Meh, I've locked in my gains on the options play and (assuming shit doesn't absolutely slam into the fan) my sell orders will still lock in profits for the shares. So either way I'm pretty green and it can't be *too* dumb if you make money on it.

Just like TSLA, they noted it's going to be high at first, and then it will drop as they expand. They are vertically integrated, just like Tesla. They have a plan to scale, go listen to the last earnings call.

Average: $28 for reference so I'm biased."
2021-05-24 07:48:48,wallstreetbets,I don’t think it’ll reach 60 again this year. The reason it got so high was because of the GME short squeeze. Maybe 50 if everything goes to plan and there’s no more delays and they give us more info on when commercial flights will be starting but I doubt that will happen this year. It’s my biggest position but still not convinced it’ll reach 60. 40 by the end of the year is my guess
2021-05-24 13:02:47,wallstreetbets,"Well, fair enough, looks like I have some more research to do on Virgin’s plans.

However I would strongly disagree about the SpaceX comparison. Cost to space is the largest barrier to any space business and SpaceX is leading in reducing that. If you don’t think orbital Starship cruises are a mortal threat to Virgin’s business plans then you need to think again."

2021-05-24 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"The safer Michael Burry play? Alright so I've been thinking of this for a while. I understand Michael Burry has a very large put position on the TLT 20 Year Treasury Bonds and is basically under the impression that interest rates are going to skyrocket sometime soon. However instead of doing that, would it be safer to short the Vanguard High Growth ETF since it is positively correlated with low interest rates? Curious to see if what I just said is complete nonsense 👌"
2021-05-24 05:50:55,wallstreetbets,"When do you honestly expect interest rates to increase?  It won’t happen this year. 

Burry is probably right but he can afford to wait 2-3 years.

They will have to choose between inflation/hyperinflation or a depression. If the first happens (which I think will be the case), your play won't turn out to be as profitable. Keep in mind that in the 70s till 1981 interest rates were as high as 15% and the US Dollar still experienced double digits inflation rates. Not too long ago, the Fed tried to raise rates to 2.5% but they retracted as they feared a crisis they have avoided since 2009 by printing money"

These artificial supply constraints such as processed wood going up 400% while raw wood literally has not moved since 2019 are the biggest clue that there is no real inflation and no real shortage of ""goods.""

But of course Burry was the ONLY ONE TO SEE THE HOUSING BUBBLE IN 2008!  (if one ignores the literal thousands of articles and comments on this topic in the 36 months before then)"
2021-05-24 08:57:44,wallstreetbets,"The Fed won’t be raising rates anytime soon, they literally can’t. The second they raise the federal funds rate this house-of-cards economy is going to collapse in on itself. They are also obligated to keep bond yields down because otherwise we can’t pay the interest on our debt. Since there are no real buyers of treasuries anymore, the Fed has to print money to buy up bonds and keep yields down, but in doing so they have created more inflation. This inflationary cycle will spiral out of control. I would play mining stocks and allocate a small percentage to physical"
2021-05-24 06:43:40,wallstreetbets,"Well like you gotta stick with your thesis alright, 
Like there so many uncertainty if you go shorts stocks
Like 
what if taxes were lowered 🤷
What if import and export laws change 🤷
What if retail sltarders / index wtf people kept it up 🤷
Ya know stuff like that, more risk 
It's better to stick with shorting bond ETFs imo

Also shorting housing would be a good bet too, as we're basically in a bubble in housing, so many refinances, new players and building boom due to low interest rate, shorting housing is much safer bet than shorting growth stock imo

Buy a short treasury etf (there are several with different bond duration and leverage).  This way you avoid the interest payments from shorting a long bond etf.

There is far less supply than demand on lumber. 
Doesn’t mean it isn’t transitory though and doesn’t mean that it applies across the board to drive real inflation through the economy. 
Inflation plays are likely a terrible idea. Targeting specific companies and products like wood and steel that are in high demand are likely a good idea."

2021-05-24 08:50:36,wallstreetbets,"Yeah... I’m just going to pile on here and say that housing prices are up for so many different reasons:

1. They retain value during inflation so the demand is high. Inflation continues to rise and many fear a sudden spike.

2. Interest rates are low which makes houses a lower risk purchase. The Fed committed to keeping interest rates low and there’s plenty of room for US treasuries to go lower and even negative like Germany’s.

3. The price of building materials sky rocketed which hurt the supply of new homes being built. Even once material prices fall or even crash, there will be a healthy buffer before housing prices follow because it takes time to build."

Raising interest rates

YOUR BROKER ISN'T YOUR FRIEND!!!!

Your broker commingles shares. Your uglies are touching your friends uglies are touching your wifes uglies and unless your name is attached to the share. The name on the share is actually your brokers name and there is an asterisk with your name next to it. But remember the float is larger than what retail has purchased. So who knows maybe you have a real share or maybe you have the fake one. 

:)
What this means is that if you have a broker who buys your shares and you pay them for the said shares your name isn't on those shares the brokers name is on those shares. THE ONLY WAY YOUR NAME IS ON A SHARE OF GAMESTOP OR ANY OTHER SHARE OF ANY OTHER COMPANY FOR THAT MATTER IS IF THE TRANSFER AGENT OR THE COMPANY THEMSELVES ISSUE STOCK IN YOUR NAME.

2021-05-24 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Airline sector DD Are airlines undervalued? My analysis

Hello folks, I’ve seen a lot of questions and comments about airline stocks the past couple of weeks, and thought I would give my opinion on which airlines are most likely to be profitable in the future, as well as what I think the future holds for the sector in general.

I am an advisor/analyst for Brighton Jones (a team of money managers, advisors, analysts, and accounts) and have beaten the market 6/8 of the past years, with an average yearly return of +22%. I don’t say this to brag or to seem self important, I just want to make it clear that I’m not some random Joe Schmoe who made money investing during March of last year, made profit during the massive bull market that succeeded it, and now thinks they’re the next Warren Buffet.

The first thing I want to talk about is my opinion in airlines in general. The airline industry was among the hardest hit sectors of the market during Covid 19. As a value investor, what sticks out to me about Airlines is that unlike the vast majority of other sectors (I’m aware Airlines are a sub-category of the transportation sector, and aren’t technically their own sector, but you get the point) many Airlines are trading at a market cap well below their pre-covid price. 

With the Vaccine rollout and easing of legislation in most parts of the world, airlines should soon (in most estimations by mid 2022-2023) be back to pre covid levels. I estimate that certain airlines are bound to increase in price by 30-60% (we’ll get to those in a bit) in the near future, but I also think there are a few airline securities that are completely overvalued and are due for a pullback. The following paragraphs will be my opinion on some of the major airline stocks.

AAL

I think this stock is reasonably priced right now. If you bought in during March of last year you would have profited 117% (the second largest, only behind UAL). AAL has a pretty low net profit 5 year average (compared to other airlines and market cap) at 1.95 Billion, but has a high average revenue (the highest of the major stocks) at 43 Billion. If you’re a net profit guy/gal, you should stay away from this one. If Revenue is more important to you, you could justify a buy right now because AAL’s market cap is the lowest of the major airlines (Delta, Southwest, and United) but the company (at least before covid) generated more revenue than all of them. I just don’t see enough profit here to justify a buy, but I don’t think it’s necessarily a sell either. Sorry for a non-concrete opinion on this one. (It’s the only stock here I don’t think is either completely overvalued or undervalued).

Delta

Delta is a buy in my opinion. Delta is a stock where you get what you pay for. Delta’s 30 Billion $ in market cap is higher than every airline’s besides Southwest, but Delta’s yearly profit is roughly twice as much than the runner up’s (also Southwest) and has the second highest average revenue (about 100 million, not even half a percent less than AAL’s). Delta has the second highest customer satisfaction (a metric I think is overvalued when it comes to security analysis, but still matters somewhat) and has an average leadership staff. Delta should be the most valuable airline on the market, and should be trading around 40-45 Billion market cap (roughly 10 times average profit, less than 1.2 times revenue.) Even if you had a somewhat negative outlook on the airline sector, that isn’t an unfair price.

Southwest

Sell sell sell. Southwest is an awesome company. Their customer satisfaction was the highest of any airline, and they are by far the most respected airline out there. With that being said, there is absolutely no data that justifies LUV being at a market cap of 37 Billion $ (7 Billion $ higher than Delta, a company that is much more profitable). Southwest is at a higher price than it was at directly before covid (yea, you read that right) and there is no justification for it.

United

This is a higher risk - higher reward Delta. UAL has a market cap lower than Delta by about 60%, lower than LUV by about 100%, and only about 15% higher than AAL. But, United is second in average yearly profit, and is barely behind the two neck-and-neck revenue leaders by a small amount (43 vs 40 Billion $). Unlike Delta, there are a few things that worry me about this company. First and foremost, public opinion (again, I think this is overvalued a bit, but is still important. United is the most hated airline in America ; and was voted as a top 20 most hated company in America a year or so ago. Seriously, these guys are the Martin Shkreli of airlines. The second worry I have about UAL is their profit margins. Compared to other airlines, UAL’s has been abysmal. Under new leadership (that I really like) I think that will change. While Delta offers the best value but a below average opportunity for growth, UAL offers the second best value as well as the second best opportunity for growth.

Thanks for taking the time to read this, and I’d love to hear any comments and opinions you guys have. As a disclosure (this isn’t legally necessary, I just include it in good faith) I do own shares and have clients who own Delta shares, and I have clients who own United shares. I do not own any other airlines, and my clients (at least from me) do not either. 

I really enjoyed doing this, and would love to do it again on any stock/security you guys would like it on."

2021-05-24 04:15:50,wallstreetbets,"There’s a lot that goes into airlines that needs to be considered here, and they’re the determinantes behind a lot of the disparities in relative valuations. Some examples:

What is the average utilization of a flight? Some airlines have been filling middle seats while others have kept them free. Pre-covid even, some airlines were much better optimizing their flights than others for higher utilization (e.g. Delta was king of this before the pandemic)

What routes do the airlines cover? Is it mostly cheap Inter-hub destinations with low margins? Or niche vacation spots with higher margins but lower utilization? What percent is international versus domestic, and how does the environment look for international travel? 

Also, a huge part of airlines is where they are in their aircraft cycle — did they just upgrade and already went through the capex spend so they’re well-positioned going forward? Or do they need to buy a new fleet and are going to hemorrhage cash in the next few years?

How are they levered? AAL is over levered relative to peers, hence the discount.

What percentage of their corporate versus consumer? Which demographic is expected to bounce back more quickly post Covid? (Answer: Consumer - this is why Southwest is trading so well while United has lagged.)

These are just some of the questions the smart money is asking — and you should be asking them too before you make any big bets."

I still think we see a much slower recovery than people expect caused by rising fuel costs, rising training costs, and overall slow recovery in business travel. 

I’d guess the industry trades sideways for a while until the COVID dust settles."

2021-05-24 07:34:38,wallstreetbets,"Airlines are overvalued. They all took on new debt. A lot of them had equity raises. They all trade higher than they did precovid by enterprise value. 

At the same time, there’s no guarantee that business travel returns to what it was, and is likely not to. So you end up with an industry that now costs more and has less consumers with a commoditized product. I wouldn’t be surprised if the weaker airlines like American go bankrupt in the next 3-4 years

🐻"
2021-05-24 08:01:29,wallstreetbets,I am short aal.  Business travel is going to be a much slower recovery and they carry so much debt.  If you want an airline stock right now focus on the budget carriers that cater to personal and vacation travel.  Less overhead and much faster bounce back. I hold jetblue.

They've been the most aggressive of the 3 but that's because they need to be. Plus they're relying on Jet Blue and Alaska to supplement their northeast and northwest flying. I don't really see AAL going past $27 or so. Their stock was already tanking before covid hit

I'm personally sticking with Delta, United and Spirit for recovery"

Single type of aircraft means significantly streamlined maintenance, making it easier to store aircraft and put them back in service. Also, figured domestic travel would come back sooner than international. 

Think I got lucky on a couple things too: MAX is back at the perfect time and this is going to generate significant savings for Southwest in terms of per-seat-mile costs, especially as fuel prices continue ticking up. Also, Covid has shown us how unimportant working in person is, as well as meeting in person, and I think this is going to hit the big 3 hard compared to Southwest, which is less reliant on business travel."

2021-05-24 03:11:52,wallstreetbets,I agree with this. The awesome thing about UAL as a recovery play is that even if it’s only at 80% of pre covid metrics by late 2022 it’s still a money maker.

2021-05-24 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$KT - Wait for 2-4x your money while collecting a 4.4% dividend? My third DD update on Korean tech giant KT Corporation! **Disclosure:**

Just a regular investor trying to figure out the value of KT Corporation. I am currently long via shares and July 2021 12.50 and 15.00 call options. 

&#x200B;

**History of my Due Diligence:**

&#x200B;

[First Post on 1/31/2021](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepDueDiligence/comments/l9692t/kt_kt_corporation_top_korean_telecom_below_book/)

[Second Post on 3/15/2021](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepDueDiligence/comments/m5y5yc/six_week_update_on_kt_corporation_stock_up_11/)

[Mind Map Chart I posted on 4/18/2021](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lLS1JWc=/)

&#x200B;

TL;DR - KT Corporation is in the middle of a transformation... from their traditional ""MIT"" businesses (Mobile, Internet and TV) into a digital services company with products and services that compare to Netflix, Spotify, Amazon Web Services, Mint App, AliPay, ... while also being on the cutting edge of Robotics and AI. 

&#x200B;

Stock Price on 1/31/2021 - $10.52

Stock Price as of last close - $13.76 

&#x200B;

**Current price momentum:**

Had a recent high of $14.20 after investors had digested the most recent earnings call about a week ago. On Friday the stock had a decent sell off at roughly 4%. Currently pulling back into previous support lines and the stock has had a recent 3 month upward trajectory. Based on the most recent conference call, I believe that any pullback should be bought and that the price will continue moving upward as we move into 2022.

&#x200B;

**Conference Call Highlight:**

[Full Q1 Earnings PR Transcript and Conference Call](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/05/11/kt-corporation-kt-q1-2021-earnings-call-transcript/)

*""There were much progress in the financial sector as well. K Bank, whose deposit as of end of 2020 was 5 trillion, with customer-base of 1million 720thousand, and by expanding its partnerships and offering differentiated benefits, was able to grow total deposit to 12.1 trillion won, with 5 million 370 thousand customers as of April-end ’21.* ***We plan to further speed up the upward trend through additional capital increase before the end of the year.*** *""*

K Bank is one of two internet banks in Korea and in 4 months, were able to grow from 1.72 million customers to 5.37 million customers. And note that last line- ""SPEED UP the upward trend through additional capital increase"". Speed up more than TRIPLING in 4 months? Unbelievable! The fact that they are saying for sure they can grow if they just put more money into is pretty impressive. I did some digging and it seems to be [because of a partnership with UpBit](https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/biz/2021/05/175_309191.html)... a top korean (censored) exchange.

What is an internet bank, with 10 million customers worth? This new product is quite impressive and going to be a key thing to keep an eye on because [they want to spin-off Kbank and the current estimated value is about $7 billion dollars](https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/biz/2021/05/175_309191.html).

&#x200B;

**Major (to me) News/Updates Since My Last Post, 3/15/2021:**

3/17/2021 - [KT beefs up cloud business](http://m.koreatimes.co.kr/pages/article.asp?newsIdx=305637) (talks about  ""currently generating 400 billion won in cloud sales, but considering our infrastructure, we aim to achieve 1 trillion won by 2023."")

4/09/2021 - [KT to build second ""Genie Music"" in Vietnam](https://m.stock.naver.com/item/main.nhn#/stocks/030200/news/0003895173/office/011) (Genie music is their music streaming platform [which has 4.4 million subscribers](https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/tech/2021/02/129_303991.html). I really like the localized strategy and I believe the investments like this will pay off big in the long run... Vietnam has nearly 100 million people, for your reference.)

5/18/2021 - [KT Corp opens data center in Seoul, in response to increased demand](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/kt-corp-opens-data-center-in-seoul-south-korea/) (this reiterates the growth targets mentioned in the 3/17/2021 article).

5/21/2021 - [Korean Analysts predicting stock will double by 2022](https://www.kedglobal.com/newsView/ked202105210009) (Analysts seem to be digesting all the news and recent earnings postively... which is good to see. I believe Korean analysts are conservative, so to see headlines like this for a major company is interesting).

Ongoing .... [A huge amount of patents being filed this year and last](https://www.quiverquant.com/patentsearch/ticker/KT?searchticker=KT). I haven't done too much research into their patent portfolio, but a couple new ones popped up this week which led me to the linked website. They seem to be protecting their 5G innovations a bunch...

&#x200B;

**Conclusion/Forecast:**

KT is still significantly undervalued in my opinion, while there is significantly less risk than during the first time I posted about it, nearly 4 months ago.

In my first post, I mentioned my personal target of $20-50 per share within 1-4 years. That is mainly based on technical indicators. I'm still not sure exactly how to value all KT's current assets and future growth. There is so much going on in the company with news nearly everyday, but all in Korean, making it a bit hard to follow.

The more I research and follow the company, the more I realize it's setting itself up to be powerhouse not just in Korea, but in all of Southeast Asia... and it's succeeding. With a TTM net income of nearly 700 million dollars, a 50% dividend payout ratio and multiple high growth opportunities, why is it only valued at 7.4 billion dollars? What is fair value for $KT?"

Also another minor maye dumb question, since the dollar seems to be going to shit, is this mostly protected from usd inflation? I dont get exactly know how a stock being listed in another exchange works  yet"

2021-05-24 19:11:46,wallstreetbets,"Oh ive been waiting hours for your reply, but it seems you wrote it the wrong place lol, thankfully i still had this thread open in a tab

i asked some streamer i watch to quickly check it out, and he mentioned that there is basically no volume (prob why it doesnt move with adr like you mentioned, though i still need to research more about what an adr is, but i think i got the gist)

another thing he mentioned was that it trades with its 21 moving day average, so hes guessing a short term dip/correction https://imgur.com/x9vDgRE im not a trader so i dont understand this shit and im not even sure if my screenshot has the right moving average

it might be worth it to pay some randoms $5 to get some outside perspective on this, atleast personally i feel more assured when i know whats potentially the downsides to a stock i like

Another thing about inflation, do we know if this things dividend is ""decided"" in usd or won? As in if the dollar goes down will the dividend go up? or will korean owners dividend go down?

for example so they get 0,61usd which would be less won if the usd tanks, but if we get 600won and next year that is ie 0,70usd. i think thats how that would work right?

ill read up some more, but if it dips like it usually does its about time i get in, at this point if it goes back down to $12 the lost money will hurt less than the regret if it goes to $16"

We can send money or get money on kakaotalk with chats. I think that's the biggest merit, and that's the one K bank cant achieve, since they dont have any well-known messenger app like kakao.

Still, KT looks really good stock. And with 5G boom, it could be uprising this year and so on. If u consider KT as a long term stock, i think you can get some money from here."

However, there are some more negatives including its issues with Ant Financial and competition in both China and outside.

PDD is taking share, with Chinese Tik Tok moving into ecommerce. Outside, Lazada has lost share to Shopee.

But the cash this will generate will be huge for the next few years. It shouldn’t be trading where it is"
2021-05-24 00:36:18,wallstreetbets,Bought in $88 and sold it at $260 this year. Time in the market vs timing the market paid off long term. Personally I think it’s done. With Jack Ma out of the game BABA is done IMHO.

Fundamentals matter probably 10% of the time. 90% of the time it's emotions, speculation, and supply/demand, and as long as the markets of other countries remain stable, there will likely persist a lack of demand for Chinese equities. I'm still holding some exposure through an emerging markets ETF just in case there's a reverse of good fortunes, but the headwinds are strong in the near-term."

2021-05-24 06:27:24,wallstreetbets,In airlines I like IAG. (British Airways and Iberian). Largest cash reserves of European airlines. Still under 50% of pre covid price. The British government will not let it fail. I’m prepared to hold for longer than a year but when the profitable transatlantic routes to get going again it should jump. There may be dips and better opportunities to buy before then if there is bad news about covid but I can’t see it staying so low forever.
2021-05-24 10:47:21,wallstreetbets,">IAG

Thanks for your comment! Just checked them out too and looks like a lot of potential for recovery as well. I will get some of IAG stock as well, I already have Latam but I'm ready to hold for a couple months. People are desperate for travel and with vaccines we should see some upside in airline travel"
2021-05-24 10:51:01,wallstreetbets,"Or try ryanair. They are already pre covid levels and will profit big if travel picks up. Ultra low cost airline, good balance sheet and no bail outs needed. Not invested my self tough."
2021-05-24 11:00:42,wallstreetbets,they just posted their biggest loss in company history and they betting everything on the 737 Max - which is a mistake in my opinion
2021-05-24 11:15:05,wallstreetbets,Which airline doesn't? Approx 600~700 million net loss when excluding fuel hedges are not that much and don't hurt their balance sheet much. But yeah the Max can be mid term a huge problem. Thats why I avoid Ryanair and Boeing stock. If you want safer recovery plays check Airbus or Airports.

Meanwhile, that 300k is losing an average 3% to inflation while they sit on their hands. If you missed that crash, what makes you think you'll get in for the next one. Crashes require a big catalyst.

2021-05-24 13:59:09,wallstreetbets,"Utter Rubbish - Japans economy had already nose dived at the start of the 90's and flat-lined after that - Japan entered a recession in 2015 and the US stock mkt didn't crash, if you read different articles about the dotcom crash and you will get a different cause in each article, the fact is the market was grossly overvalued and it had to tip over at some point"
2021-05-24 01:12:21,wallstreetbets,They are starting to think about tapering now.  But who knows when.  It's all up to jpow and gang.

2021-05-23 23:39:22,wallstreetbets,"Thanks m8, good luck to ya too"
2021-05-24 00:55:35,wallstreetbets,"Seriously, the stocks have not given half a crap during most of the lockdown. Reopening is ongoing (I know - traffic is starting to suck again), so now what? Stocks will just magically crash to maintain the balance in the Force???"
2021-05-23 23:54:13,wallstreetbets,I highly doubt...
2021-05-23 23:53:02,wallstreetbets,"Theres always luck, never know when good or bad news destroys your trading analysis."
2021-05-24 17:12:03,wallstreetbets,"Uhh in TDA it will literally say right there on the stock's page, directly below the price in a massive box, why the stock is moving.  It's usually nonsense that doesn't even make sense, but I mean...yeah I do tend to read things directly in front of me that are a sentence long I suppose.  How unintelligent!"
2021-05-24 11:15:09,wallstreetbets,"thats right, most crashes dont have any specific reason they just snowball downwards"

2021-05-24 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$PRPL is poised to spike (potential 50% upside) purple gang rise up! Tards, our favorite mattress stock is currently positioned for significant upside. It has pulled back to 29 from a high of 41 a few months ago due to a non-dilutive secondary due to original investors selling shares. There has been several secondaries over the past 18 month and the price action has generally been a significant pullback then an aggressive rebound. We are at the bottom of the pullback right now.  See chart link below from the mattress king indicating previous secondaries and subsequent recoveries.

Also the 10 analysts covering PRPL have it as a strong buy and an avg price target of 38 with a high of 45.

https://preview.redd.it/gtst6d9j94071.png?width=1261&format=png&auto=webp&s=912f92864de8b67940ec2988573ebce4c2b4d13c


PRPL also is very nearly oversold and is below rsi 50 (neutral)  so there is good runway to the upside from where we are now.  Article discussion linked below

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nasdaq.com/articles/2-strong-buy-growth-stocks-for-investors-to-add-at-big-discounts-2021-05-21%3famp

My positions between all accounts now total nearly half a million, only one account is the in image (it is the largest) but I have across accounts

https://ibb.co/VTL1Nvk

17,000 shares
6/18 35c
7/16 30, 35,40c
Jan 2023 leaps ITM at 20c and also 40c.
10/15 30c
Also also have several CSPs of varying strikes

They also significantly beat on their recent earnings report and raised guidance for the year.

https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/PRPL/earnings/


I believe that with the back drop of a very positive earnings report, raised guidance, and a non dilutive secondary offering that there is significant catalyst to propel PRPL back to the mid to high 30's and potentially all time high of low 40s. I expect a steep climb over the next few weeks.

For further excellent DD please see our beloved Mattress King u/Dhsmatt2

Tldr: I'm jacked past my tits on prpl, at 29 now gonna be high 30s very soon due to catalysts listed above. 

My recs would be 
July 30s and 35s very good chance of printing

June 30s and 35s if you want more horse power. 

ITM leaps 20s (spreads are wide so be careful) if you want some relatively safe leverage

Shares for boomer fucks,  
safest, will print either now or definitely in the future, prpl is growing and expanding like gang busters and ain't goin anywhere.


Sounds like perfect play for a quick return for u/sir_jack_a_lot, even though he is in clang gang and CLF right now I think.

As always be careful out there, don't do what you don't understand, not financial advice."

2021-05-24 07:15:24,wallstreetbets,My ongoing purple play has been selling CSPs when it drops below $30. It's never let me down. Not once. I also hold shares in my retirement account with a sub \~$20 cost basis. I also bought a pad but I hated it and sent it back. I did buy the $170 sheets tho and I love them.
2021-05-24 08:56:48,wallstreetbets,With inflation on the rise money in the mattress is the worst play.

2021-05-24 00:51:07,wallstreetbets,"Looks like I found my new put

SPCE"
2021-05-23 20:55:38,wallstreetbets,"As someone who knows his shit about SPCE, this is encouraging. Longest awaited catalyst for the stock ever was a huge success with many more to come in the next few months (I expect Branson to fly in July). 

Add to that that it’s dramatically oversold by people who didn’t do their research on Branson selling shares to keep Virgin Atlantic afloat, and Cathie Wood selling because she’s bleeding cash, with respectably high short interest and newfound confidence from institutions and buyers waiting to see that they still had what it takes?

Absolute rocket fuel, in my opinion. My cost average is around $9 for 1000 shares from the original COVID crash, and I have 15 $30 6/4c. I’ve held my shares for over a year through all of the ups and downs because I know the hype from Branson flying will be unlike anything we’ve ever seen before. 

It’s a literal spaceship ffs. I’m so hype for market open tomorrow"
2021-05-24 01:17:18,wallstreetbets,It's already 27.98$ at Russian pre-market

2021-05-24 00:01:41,wallstreetbets,"I agree with holding through to Branson’s flight possibly in July but your call option expires  6/4 (like mine btw). The question is, when do we sell, and buy back in, and for how long?"

2021-05-23 23:02:13,wallstreetbets,"Let me tell you why I will buy puts. 

The Theory of Robinhood and WallStreetBets.

• When people see something on WSB and they read all this dd, the first thing they might do, is buy, and chances are they will buy on RH as they are the dominant player in the retail WSB apes. 

• When you buy on RH, you are on a Margin Account which means you don't technically own the stock. You basically have an 'IOU' from RH and they take your money. 

• RH's goal is to fuck you out of your money. This means, if 10,000 people buy SPCE, they will take 10,000 and short. If they short and can drive the price down, of those 10,000 people who own IOU's half of them will sell back their IOU at the new short price (let's say 50%). This means RH just made 50% FREE MONEY on you AND they made money on the short & rebuy. So it's a win-win because retail sells and cries. They never really purchased SPCE, they just gave you an IOU for those shares. 

• So, when 10,000 apes drop 1,000,000 in cash, here is what happens. Due to ""payment for order flow"", Citadel sees that a million dollars of buys are coming. Price is $38. So, Citadel jumps that line, buying 1M also. So Citadel buys at $38, driving the price to $39, and retail buys drive the price at $39, pushing it to $40. This happens so fast, that retail doesn't get why they bought in at $38 but really paid $39. Then, Citadel sells at $40, making a $2 profit in SECONDS. and the price, literally SECONDS after you buy, at $39, which pushes it to $40, now drops back to $39 and sometimes even less. So you buy after Citadel buys and when you sell, you also sell after citadel, so you get fucked twice. You could hypothetically Buy at what you think is $38, and it processes at $39, and then the second later you sell, you think you are selling at $39 but because you are now BEHIND citadel in the sell too, you are selling at $38, effectively costing you to pay more, and sell less causing you to lose $1 within a second. But that doesn't really happen, so instead, they short. Shorting makes you sell because you panic, and they win. 

So, the news doesn't matter.

The only thing that matters is how much people from WSB buy. The more they buy, the more you bet against."
2021-05-23 22:50:50,wallstreetbets,I'd be surprised if there was a crash considering most people thought they would delay or engine wouldn't start. As a long time holder even I had my doubts. I don't think a flight much less a sucess was actually priced in during the 2 trading days after flight announcement.
2021-05-24 00:52:28,wallstreetbets,A good strategy is to inverse this sub. I’ve made a shit ton doing so.
2021-05-23 23:35:05,wallstreetbets,"Or it’s going to cause a lot of people to go in and buy while it’s low again. Either way, coin makes money on the buying and selling"

2021-05-24 00:02:31,wallstreetbets,You had to do it. This is the way
2021-05-24 10:34:54,wallstreetbets,LMAO they have bots for this shit
2021-05-24 10:34:28,wallstreetbets,oof
2021-05-23 21:21:34,wallstreetbets,the company literally flew to space this weekend and this dude doesn't think it could be actual hype in a subreddit whose brand is rocketship emojis lmao. unbelievable
2021-05-23 22:47:48,wallstreetbets,"Just a heads up, this is their 3rd time to space, first from Spaceport America, first test with cabin fully installed, and last flight needed for FAA certification."

2021-05-24 03:31:18,wallstreetbets,Sorry that's without the S at the end
2021-05-23 23:06:31,wallstreetbets,"I have a friend that made a script that just does the opposite of whatever wsb sentiment is and that makes money, so ya I get that... but at the same time this stock actually has potential. If you short it at what it is rn you’re gonna lose some cash. Plz post when that happens! It would make my day"
2021-05-23 23:15:45,wallstreetbets,Pretty cool break down. Happened to me on a stop loss. Had it at 15$ RH sold it at 14.95.
2021-05-24 00:53:13,wallstreetbets,Inversing this sub is actually brilliant
2021-05-23 22:54:24,wallstreetbets,I agree with you 100%. That’s why I’m so confused why anyone would buy puts. Gotta be a joke
2021-05-23 23:26:43,wallstreetbets,For p/e to be negative then they’d have to be losing money lol
2021-05-23 22:47:07,wallstreetbets,BB has a market cap of $4.82 billion and 2020 revenue was $1.04 billion which is where I got he 4.63x valuation number from. I know that it’s a very simple way to value a company and there are a ton of other factors to consider but I feel like that’s a simple way to see if something is undervalued.
2021-05-24 00:05:56,wallstreetbets,This
2021-05-24 12:36:05,wallstreetbets,Now go tell it..

2021-05-23 21:24:57,wallstreetbets,"My guess is he's just FOMOing he didn't buy Friday. Although I'm sure he'll reply here soon explaining he isnt, with lots of hyperbolic statements proving us wrong."
2021-05-23 22:07:08,wallstreetbets,Remindme! 1 day
2021-05-23 21:32:50,wallstreetbets,It’s also had a 30% run over when it announced. This isn’t the same environment when it ran to 60
2021-05-24 18:22:24,wallstreetbets,hey what did you need the reminder for?
2021-05-23 23:29:32,wallstreetbets,"I am going to bet it will be super strong this week, UNTIL RobinHood posts a news clip ""SPCE is up 59% and everyone is wondering why"" because the moment they do that, be warned, it's coming."
2021-05-24 00:56:55,wallstreetbets,"You wait for it to pop first, then you buy the put. Don’t buy it immediately at open. Gotta wait for that fomo to kick-in. Once it does, you buy puts.

Also, this stock isn’t going to be profitable anytime soon. It’s got a good 10-20 year horizon before it becomes profitable."
2021-05-24 05:20:23,wallstreetbets,Every stock has potential
2021-05-23 23:26:07,wallstreetbets,"Stop losses are a bit different. 

So, let's say that a big whale sells GME on WeBull. Webull reports the new price at $14.95 from $15.95. RH wasn't there to actually see it decline as it was on another person's network, so when they get the information, it's already $14.95 and they weren't able to do anything. Now according to Matt Kohrs (youtuber) unless the price is ON robinhood, AND also HITS YOUR LIMIT EXACTLY it might not execute. Because it could go from $16 to $12 on the open market and by the time it's $12, RH can't react electronically to put you in there as it doesn't actually go step by step but one giant instant drop."
2021-05-23 23:05:33,wallstreetbets,"I buy puts because the news doesn't matter. Only RH shorting matters. If 1M apes drop 1M in cash to push the price up, RH is going to take that M and instead, short. Maybe not today, but very very soon."
2021-05-23 23:12:08,wallstreetbets,Idk bro. It would be funny to see the loss porn but most people just down talk stocks and don't hold positions.
2021-05-24 01:38:16,wallstreetbets,Is

2021-05-23 21:29:24,wallstreetbets,hey while we're talking did you get your conspiracy against GME check from Citadel yet this week? Todd in accounting said it should hit my account on Fridays but mine still hasn't come in
2021-05-24 18:21:46,wallstreetbets,hey was there something you wanted to be reminded of
2021-05-23 22:05:27,wallstreetbets,"Are you implying the pre-runup was pricing in, or that the runup will be larger now?"
2021-05-24 18:48:21,wallstreetbets,"😂😂 I was wrong. I just had a sneaking suspicion that all the SPCE talk has been fuckery, but I was definitely wrong."
2021-05-23 23:32:42,wallstreetbets,"Damn,  thanks for the info 👍"
2021-05-23 23:11:22,wallstreetbets,"I do actually understand what you mean. But the news definitely matters. Institutions will buy, a few shorts will have to cover. The company will pick up the pace and have more tests with more frequency, eventually sending its founder up. Sure, the apes will do what they do, but it’ll be outmatched by actual growth"

2021-05-24 01:10:02,wallstreetbets,I prefer the 5 figure gains/losses. That way you know it was someone's whole yolo and not just a rich kid where 6-7 figures means nothing

2021-05-24 02:24:12,wallstreetbets,"\^ This.  


Seriously dudes and dudettes, this sub is NOT a sub for learning to make money. Very very few lucky SOB's get to make some money, while the rest of us just watch some random guy YOLO his life savings on some veggies and lose all of it faster than China's censorship of its government.  


The only reasonable thing to take from here is to know what NOT to do. Just remove your mind and have fun watching people crash and burn!"

2021-05-24 02:37:00,wallstreetbets,No shit! The “fiancé dumped me” posts have been so cringe! People need to learn how to not share so damn much of their personal lives!

2021-05-24 03:24:09,wallstreetbets,"I see pussies posting unrealized three and four figure losses. Oh woe is me for I have neither the stomach or intelligence required to better my funds. JFC.

We joke about being stupid or whatever but the truth is that it's a way to shed some of the negative head space that occurs with losses. If you would cry about it, laugh about it instead, there will always be someone else with a higher loss.

Shit I took 20k in unrealized losses on the MVIS knife dropping. You know what I did? I sold worthless calls to other tards to the tune of 18k.

So for all you young/new bloods that came in because you saw a rocket on the news and didn't have any sense. Welcome to the casino, where bears make money, bulls make money, and stupid fucking paper handed shaky fear pigs get cut up for breakfast. Figure out which one you want to be and stick to it. If you don't know what to do the market will sort you the fuck out real quick."

2021-05-24 03:55:37,wallstreetbets,This sub has become a parody of itself. Like imagine you replaced everyone in the sub with a person pretending to be an og follower. Thats what we have here. A room full of posers thinking they are the only poser.

2021-05-24 05:55:40,wallstreetbets,This subreddit has the same purpose as market watch. Manipulate the public for the hedgefunds
2021-05-24 05:55:55,wallstreetbets,Moon to the moon🚀
2021-05-24 06:08:09,wallstreetbets,So since I haven’t made 6 figures should I leave or? No but seriously I agree with this sentiment.

Now we have subreddits with people capitalizing from the vacuum their messiah left when he exited stage left.

2021-05-24 01:20:57,wallstreetbets,Therapy has been an important part of this subreddit for many years. People post their six figure losses and we tell them not to go long $ROPE.

2021-05-24 06:45:31,wallstreetbets,"Just take a look at the sub, and it’s very clear that many people are extremely emotionally invested. This has become the cornerstone of many people’s daily lives. The memes and inside jokes promote a sense of camaraderie, and some people don’t get that anywhere else. You’ve made a club for emotionally stunted retards, and now you’re like “wow, why does everyone act like we’re friends and we give a shit about them?”

Don’t get me wrong, I think I know the exact post that inspired this one, and it was pretty embarrassing, but it’s to be expected with the way this sub is. You’re giving hope to a lot of people who never had any, they’re daring to dream about changing their lives, and that’s emotional for them. Who better for them to discuss those things with than others who are in the same boat?

But I guess an echo chamber where everyone just jerks each other off with “GME good, to da moon, diamond hands, apes together strong but don’t talk about anything you’re thinking or feeling unless it’s ‘GME good’” is ok too. It’s not like other Reddit users are actual humans that anyone should care about, right?"

I don't know the details but my friend said I could make a ton by farming them in 50-gallon barrels in my backyard. 

I still have some market research to do but I live in a desert and none of my neighbors are farming eels so I'm pretty sure that means it literally can't go tits up."

He was always ashamed of this, man. And then right after that he's adopted by this man, Tito Liebowitz. He's a small time gun runner and a rottweiler fight promoter. So he puts Killer into training. They see Killer's good. He is damn good. But then he had the fight of his life. They pit him against his brother Nibbles. And Killer said, ""no man that's my brother, I can't fight Nibbles"" but they made him fight anyway, and Killer, he killed Nibbles. Killer said, ""that's it!"" He called off all his fights, and he started doing crack, and he freaked out. Then in a rage, he collapsed, and his heart no longer beat. Wow."

“A golden bait hung temptingly out before the people, and one after the other, they rushed to the tulip-marts, like flies around a honey-pot,” wrote Mackay. “Nobles, citizens, farmers, mechanics, sea-men, footmen, maid-servants, even chimney-sweeps and old clothes-women, dabbled in tulips.”

When the tulip bubble suddenly burst in 1637, Mackay claimed that it wreaked havoc on the Dutch economy.

If you want to sell a call, you need to hold 100 shares, and they will be held as collateral by your broker (you can’t sell them until the contract expires or you buy to close it), or if you want to sell a put, have the cash available to buy 100 shares (the money required will be held as collateral and you can’t spend it or transfer it out until the contract expires or you buy to close it).

Also massive gambling posts, a mixture of everything.  Unfortunately in the last year the sub has expanded and for a while everyone down voted everything that wasn't one of the 4 meme stocks.

This place before was one of the greatest places in the internet,  now it just kind of resembles the rest of reddit.

2021-05-24 01:56:50,wallstreetbets,"I think this is because people use pesticides. And one of them is roundup which might be more of weed killer. but in any case, we're more doomed if we lose bees."

2021-05-24 08:32:51,wallstreetbets,"the local bee population yes. If you live in the USA honey bees are not native and are not in any real danger unless you are a beekeeper then varroa mites and pesticides are a problem but not so much as to kill all the hives which are easily replenished.

native bees though are on the decline. a solution for this is to stop having a mono cultured yard and plant native plants and build solitary bee nests because 90% are solitary in the usa. and for fuck sakes stop using pesticides."

Bees are fine in many areas but once they go to an area with those pesticides they die off. Then the pesticides kill all the other pollenators."

https://preview.redd.it/qa1e6ke91y071.png?width=1482&format=png&auto=webp&s=a294f7df1b76278df88b4a6311188d306f668612

I called out the clear bubble of the Dow Jones Index last month, and all people could say was ""uSe A lOg grapH"" or ""Compare it to gold"". Well I did one better, I compared it to GME. People have always called GME the ""new gold"", and I think it's only fair to view it in the same light. The findings are scary. As you can see above, the ratio follows very close to that of inflation. It then slows late 2019. This can probably be blamed on the Fed saying they were wrong, according to the Guardian. From here, it only gets worse. Covid dropped numbers significantly (No surprise), but the ratio is yet to recover. I don't know how tf you're supposed to deal with deflation, but stop ignoring the signs people. This is a log graph. Now there's nothing to hide."

2021-05-24 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"I believe TELL (Tellurian) will triple by EOY, here’s why I’m “all in” Liquified natural gas, LNG, is one of the world's fastest growing fuel sources. Low cost natural gas supplies in the US have already made the US one of the world's largest LNG exporters with Cheniere Energy (Ticker: LNG) being the largest US one. Cheniere's founder is the founder of Tellurian (Ticker: TELL).

Charif Souki (former CEO of Cheniere) was ousted from there by activist shareholder, Carl Icahn, and started TELL.

I believe he and the team at TELL - he is Executive Chairman - will do better. Unlike Cheniere, TELL has its own natgas production source and will have its own pipeline network to supply from there to its planned liquefaction plant at Lake Charles plus that network will connect with other natgas supply sources available also, as shown below...

Pipeline network: https://ibb.co/2KCHnnj

That owned Haynesville source means their pricing will be lower than Henry Hub prices that dictate Cheniere's and most other US LNG exporters prices. This from the slide show I linked in above shows TELL's price calculation...

LNG pricing: https://ibb.co/yFNbD4B

TELL's opportunity:

Spot LNG prices in Asia are usually double to triple the price of US LNG. Since such commodities win on price TELL has an enormous price advantage as an exporter at a time when demand is likely to exceed supply for a long time.

Recently the company became debt free and is in the process of finalizing commercial deals with buyers.  These deals will be announced within a few weeks according to their CEO. 🚀🚀🚀

2021-05-24 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"ASO DD in preparation for DKS earnings. Alright retards, I'm in here with a little bit of weekend DD. ASO is Academy Sports, a retail store that sells sports clothing, outdoor equipment, guns etc. Sounds boring? Yeah that's okay, I'm sure it's a lot less boring than getting destroyed week after week trying to play tech calls. You buy calls, it craters, you buy puts and it trades sideways. It's a zero sum game out there and they've got you by the balls with a spinning finger in your ass. Retail doesn't get to make money on fun stuff anymore. If you wanna play the game, try playing retarded on some boomer shit.

May 5th a company called Big 5 Sporting Goods popped 30%.

""(MT Newswires) -- Shares of Big 5 Sporting Goods (BGFV) rallied more than 30% in Wednesday afternoon trading, a day after it swung to Q1 profit and raised its quarterly dividend.

Late Tuesday, the retailer reported a Q1 net profit of $0.96 a share, compared with a net loss of $0.22 a share for the same period in 2020. Revenue rose to $272.8 million from $217.7 million.

Big 5 raised its quarterly dividend to $0.18 a share from $0.15 a share, payable June 15 to shareholders of record as of June 1. A special cash dividend of $1 per share was also declared, payable on June 1 to shareholders as of May 17.

Looking ahead, Big 5 said that it is expecting Q2 earnings of $1.05 to $1.25 a share.

Price: 25.20, Change: +6.13, Percent Change: +32.14""

Coincidentally, that same day ASO made a big move upwards as it just announced a 3.2M share buyback. On that day it moved from somewhere around $30 to over $36.

May 5th, UBS adjusts price target of Dick's from $75 up to $90.

I don't know if you are too retarded to see the correlations here but as one store makes moves, expectations in that sector adjust and these companies are moving closely in tandem with each other. March 9th 2021, Dick's increased their quarterly dividend payout by 16%.

I am uncertain about the sanity in this market and believe that 1500 PE ratios aren't going to be around much longer. I speculate that money will be sitting in recovery stocks as we begin to transition out of the pandemic.

5/10/21 JP Morgan raises price target to $40

5/11/21 UBS Adjusts price target from $32 to $40

5/12/21 Credit Suisse raises price target to $39

ASO has a 100% buy rating from 8 different analysts and a price target range from $39-40 while it closed this last Friday at $34.21 in after hours. We don't have ASO earnings until maybe June/July but Dick's is going to report earnings on May 26th. Now I cannot say with 100% certainty that they will beat expectations, but I do think that they will have favorable results. We have the joke about everything being priced in but this is exactly where it happens. If Dick's has a good earnings report, than I absolutely expect that sporting goods stores will see upwards movement in relation to a good report from it's most predominant store in the sector.

Why do I not want calls on Dick's or Big 5? I don't see Dick's expanding or becoming larger. Big 5 already jumped too much with the special cash dividend so I'm already late. Academy Sports on the other hand, is a store mostly in the South and the Midwest with a very appealing inventory and places for growth. They have a P/E ratio less than 10, while DKS is running around with a P/E ratio of 15, and in my opinion, no room to grow. Academy Sports has everything with a larger focus on outdoor products which I think will see high demand as we go into summer on the tail end of lockdowns. Entirely speculation, but I would not be entirely surprised if a special cash dividend was offered by Academy Sports considering their large cash balances and huge profits in the sporting goods sector. I truly hate seeing everything pitched as a short squeeze, which ASO is absolutely not, but I think the short interest is very relevant here.

As of April 30th, 32% of the float was sold short. When that was reported, the price saw a high of $31.08. This month, we have been trading between $36.60 and $33.90. As a whole, with 13,180,000 shares sold short, if those position are held, assuming they shorted at the highest point and could cover at the lowest price of $33.90, they would be down $2.82 a share and for them, that's a best case scenario. That's 37 million dollars down plus borrowing fees on a stock with an average volume of 2M that is heading into the most profitable part of the year, selling products to people at the end of a pandemic that have been cooped up indoors for a year and a half. The actual losses are going to be much higher because short interest increased as the price went up and hasn't gone down signifying that most, if not nearly all shares were shorted at much lower prices. They blew earnings out of the park in March and they will do it again.

If I held a large short position, not only would I be feeling uneasy about analysts targets being moved to $40, I would be paying very close attention to the other earnings calls within that market sector. I believe Dick's is going to serve as a catalyst/warning in determining whether some of these short sellers want to eat the losses now or if they want to risk holding their positions in hopes that they become profitable or can be covered at a smaller loss. If Dick's has a favorable earnings call, ASO movement will start pricing itself in and shorts covering would just be collateral that drives a little extra volume and demand. You actually have to ask yourself why a company is heavily shorted. ""Smart money"" says a stock is overvalued. SI is not supposed to be a reason to invest in something, it's just a bonus when you find out that they are wrong. You are actually retarded if you're looking to buy calls on a company only **because** it's shorted heavily. Something needs to be wrong about their shorting thesis and you have to find it. In this case, their initial stance was reasonable. Academy Sports shouldn't have posted favorable earnings during a pandemic but they did. They blew the fucking roof off and now there's no reason for this stock to come down so they can cover at a profitable price. Sales will increase and those short positions will become heavier and heavier bags until they finally dump them.

ASO is not going to move because of a short squeeze, it's going to move because the company has a solid balance sheet, large cash reserves, is doing a share buyback, exponentially increasing sales and will continue to grow it's market share until it becomes a better Dick's aimed at providing products for outdoor experiences instead of kids sportswear and overpriced yoga pants. At the end of 2020 they reported that Ecommerce sales rose 138% yoy and that they had 337 million dollars in cash and cash equivalents, which is more than double the 149 million they ended with in 2019. Also of note, Academy Sports is well positioned for our political climate with a very large selection of firearms, gun accessories and ammo (when it's not all sold out) especially in comparison to their competitors. Nobody drives gun sales like a party keen on banning them.

I'm sure many of you that are losing your asses and blowing up your portfolios are begging for a ""safe haven"" and I think ASO is the perfect choice. In the spirit of Labor Day weekend approaching, I am going to make a trip over to Academy Sports and go get some camping gear. I've been told it's packed with people and inventory is flying off the shelves so I'm going to go check for myself.

Positions. Yeah I'm sorry to say it but of course shares is obviously the safe bet here, especially with the way the market has been moving. If you are losing and need a break, this is a good place to pause and take a breather. However, I'm retarded and fully loaded up on 35c expiring mid June and will be buying OTM calls for July as well come Monday morning. For the smooth brains that need extra help, here you go.

JUNE 18 35C

JULY 18 35 36 37 38 39 40C

Lastly, if you look at the options chain, you'll notice there is massive open interest at the $40 strike price. A movement anywhere near that price would show drastic changes in the movement and order book because the volume is so low. With IV around 70%, a strong movement upwards would be extremely profitable for call holders that end up ITM. Keep in mind, if Dick's has a good call, the sector is very likely to react on that report alone. Following that, Hibbett will be releasing earnings Friday 28th in pre market that will further demonstrate solid growth in the sporting goods sector. All in all, good luck. I know you like sitting around watching Dicks anyways.

TL;DR, If Dicks show continued growth and demand with strong looking forward guidance, ASO is going to rise heading into Q1 earnings report coming soon, as the price moves towards analyst's target at $40. Everything always gets priced in so this is an opportunity to think forward and start pricing values before the rest of the market does.

Edit: Going to include a comment I made. 

This is what Big 5 did.

Achieves Record First Quarter Sales and Earnings Results

Same Store Sales Increased 31.8% in FY 2021 First Quarter versus Guidance of 20%

EPS of $0.96 for FY 2021 First Quarter versus Guidance Range of $0.47 to $0.53

Ends FY 2021 First Quarter with $100.1 Million in Cash and Cash Equivalents, No Debt

Increases Quarterly Cash Dividend by 20% to $0.18 per Share

Declares Special Cash Dividend of $1.00 per Share

My point is attempting to price in a specific sector. If money is flowing in like that for Big 5, then Dick's, Academy Sports, Hibbett etc. are likely seeing that money as well.

2021-05-24 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Definitions of ""money"" Money is used as a medium of exchange, and as a store of value.

In money supply statistics, central bank money is MB while commercial bank money is divided up into M1-M3 components. Generally, the types of commercial bank money that tend to be valued at lower amounts are classified in the narrow category of M1, while the types of commercial bank money that tend to exist in larger amounts are categorized as M2 and M3.

In general, M1 and M2 money have a much lower return of investment (ROI) in banks than that of M3 and M4.

M1: The total of all physical currency including coinage. Consists of money commonly used for payment. It essentially consists of currency in circulation and checking account balances.
M2: M1 + most savings accounts, money market accounts, retail money market mutual funds, and small deposits (certificates of deposit of under $100,000).
M3: M2 + all other CDs (large deposits, institutional money market mutual fund balances), deposits of eurodollars and repurchase agreements.
M4-: M3 + Commercial Paper
M4: M4- + T-Bills (or M3 + Commercial Paper + T-Bills)
L & Money Multiplier

The United States Federal Reserve published data on three monetary aggregates until 2006, when it ceased publication of M3 data and began to  publish only data on M1 and M2.

Here are three charts that show the changes of money in circulation in the US.

The currency in circulation increased over the years.

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MBCURRCIR

2. M1 money in circulation.

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M1V

3. M2 money in circulation.

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2V


The cause of the changes in money allocation shown is the charts is very simple. M3, M4 and higher components provide a much higher return of investment (ROI) than M1 and M2 components. Banks seek higher ROI, so they diverge money to M3, M4 and higher components, instead of M1 and M2. 

As a result, although there are increasing amount of money in the circulation, the physical currency (M1 money) that people use to buy food and pay rent has dropped substantially, and the money in people’s saving accounts (M2 money) has also dropped sharply.

The solution is quite simple. People are at the core of US economy, and money was created to be a medium of exchange among people.

1. Injecting money directly into the real economy is important. The COVID-1 stimulus package did something good for the US economy.
2. Publication of M3, M4 and higher components data is needed. What people do not see hurts the economy.
3. Require banks to circulate money through M1 and M2 components. People’s deposits and federal money should serve the people first. People can then make their investment decisions when they have extra money.

When people have abundant money to use, the US economy is strong; when people are suffering, the economy is weak. People are at the core of the economy. If we serve the people first, then other things will naturally fall into place.

Must try harder.   


Money is a complex societal and legal construct.   


Complex - many variables and moving parts. Difficult to analyse. That’s why economists. 

Societal - includes a great deal of ‘sentiment’. Political aspects. Government and the fiscus 

Legal - without the law, there is no judgement, no guidance and no enforcement.   


Money has ‘value’ because of all three above, and that value is what all three say it is.   


The absolute basic to read is this:

Trust the Bank of England to spell it out, not the Fed!"
2021-05-24 09:14:59,wallstreetbets,"Very very bad analysis. If the poors get money, it will cause inflation. That’s why the fed traps the money in assets like housing and stocks. 

The problem you are stumbling on is called a liquidity trap. Banks will not lend out money to the poors if there is not a good use for it. If there is a sound use for the money the bank can ensure they get repaid.

Ask yourself: why are there no good uses for money in our economy??? Maybe something to do with the fact that building a bridge used to cost $50,000,000 but today just the environmental impact study costs $200,000,000 and 5 years to complete. 

Regulations and government intervention have strangled our economy to death since 2008 and therefore millennials have been doing very bad. Additionally, why would I risk losing money on your broke ass when the government will let me park unlimited money in government debt? The government literally cannot default 🙄

It’s too bad these same chumps want to elect Bernie sanders and make the problem 10x worse.  

If you want to fix the problem, scale back government by ~80% and watch money get spent like crazy."

2021-05-24 09:24:35,wallstreetbets,Thank you - I think!
2021-05-24 15:57:43,wallstreetbets,"and there we have it... the ""eCoNoM!$t"" believes when you have so much fucking cash that you can afford to dump into M3+/investment tiers then M1/M2 aren't used.  They are; just to a lesser amount of that person's total wealth.  When someone cannot build up M1/M2 to dump into M3+/investment they stagnate fiscally.. this doesn't mean they cannot rise out of it.. but when he says ""people live on M1/m2"" it's accurate for the overwhelming majority that live paycheck to paycheck.  You have to have money going to the small business owner through M2 in order for them to put food on the table and pay for things and move inventory through the system to the consumer....   Literally every boomer on your block is likely trying to stack into M3/investment as they rely upon pension/SS/investments which outpace the F of their expenses....  The ""eat the rich"" motto isn't coming from these boomers!  They are not spending that excess $ they are receiving and instead just stacking higher into M3/investments because they don't need it to live off of.

It's extra for them to pass onto their kids.

honestly I'm not so sure you're an economist... if you are.. you're damn well out of touch with these average spending behaviors.  The real root of the problem might be if the majority of economists hold your same ideals and don't understand these simple basics.

To add to this, when the Government offers freebies constantly to the people whom only know how to live paycheck to paycheck, you start stifling and killing off M2 reliant things like small businesses, which in turn depresses their ability to hire and eventually can lead to liquidation events or outright collapse of their company.  But as an ""eCoNoM!$t"" I'm sure you totally think nothing is wrong with mass welfare and unemployment benefits (because paycheck to paycheck people out # small business owners (votes here majority will always win) which outstrip the pace of those small businesses and what they need to operate/function.  So what you ""eCoNoM!$ts"" have created is a system which only tenders offers to paycheck to paycheck people which in turn serves the upper echelons of M3/investors demands because I can almost grantee the mass welfare recipients aren't going to a small business to purchase that hamburger for 3.50, instead they're headed to Macdee's for that 2.50 burger and fries special."

2021-05-24 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$UWMC Unbiased Technical Analysis - Stuck In A Long Term Downtrend - But There's Room For Near-Term Upside I don't hold a position in $UWMC - but it seems to be buzzing on this subreddit so I thought I would provide you guys with an unbiased look at the chart. There are two charts I want to look at today.

First -

[$UWMC 1 Year 1 Day](https://preview.redd.it/u36jp6jgmx071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ea396bc3ec2c3f3b7e236191eb60acaf472ecc6)

On the 1 year chart - it's clear that we are still in this long term downtrend that began at the end of last December. I know a lot of people have a lot of emotions about this stock - but it's important to keep this in mind. Until we clear it - and that **9.66 key level** that corresponds with the breakout point - the long-term trend is **down.** 

After clearing it - we would look at **10.26, 11.99, 13.60** as resistance/targets.

I will note that in the near-term we did catch a solid reversal - and have key support down at **7.18.** 

Which brings me to my next chart -

[$UWMC 20 Day 2 Hour](https://preview.redd.it/titkhs0fmx071.png?width=2246&format=png&auto=webp&s=142a5763bf0da2864af7776d8e7cdb488607f00a)

Here we actually have a really nice **bull flag** pattern forming. It's goal is likely to clear this key **8.69** resistance - and take another crack at the top end of the long term downtrend. 

The entry point for this is a **2 hour** close above **8.63** \- from which we would target that **9.66** soon after. 

How I would play this - **enter on the bull flag break, scale out at 9.66, scale back in if we can crack that as well.** This would offer the best risk/reward.

***TL;DR -*** UWMC is stuck in a long-term downtrend, but it's forming a nice bull flag setup for a 1-2 day move to try and break that downtrend

Breakout Point: **8.63**  
Price Target: **9.66**

Beyond that -   
Price Targets: **10.26, 11.99, 13.60**

Because of the reliance on these abstract principles, the result is independent of subtler geometric details, so offers little geometric insight into the nature of such a chart. On the other hand, the proof is surprisingly short and clean, and a “hands-on” approach involving the explicit construction of such a chart would be potentially laborious.

2021-05-24 03:49:01,wallstreetbets,"Charts are used for trading.  Buffet is a buy and hold, or take over and fork over cash at a cheap rate from his insurance cash flow.

The charts, rarely lie.  It is the interpretation of the chart that lies.  But the OP was fair.  He gave both the long-term and short-term term chart reads.  I might argue with his pivot points...but not by much.

The take away is it is in a long-term downtrend.  And it will need something big to turn it around.  The buybacks may be the big news.  But, it does not have the juice to break away from the market trend (up Or down).

Chart reading tells you when to buy(or sell).  It does not tell you should buy.  Basically, you find a stock with a good story.    Some traders use charts to patiently pick up the stock they are interested in at a price that has a higher probability of making a profit.  They also use the charts to know when to sell.  It takes the emotional part out of owning out of the equation and keeps traders from falling in love with a stock."

Speed is their calling card which is an advantage in many respects but really serves to payout the brokers promptly.  Wholesale is better for people getting multiple mortgages at once, special cases like self employed income or poor finances.  Having a broker to shop around and do some research in that case is good.  If you are a base income buyer with a credit score above 730 no reason to pay any commission to a mortgage broker.  To think the future of mortgage lending is mainstreaming the usage of a middleman is just not correct in my mind, as I said not needed unless you have a unique situation.  Interest rates won’t be this low forever and once rates climb origination will slow.  Companies like rocket that service loans will be able to rely on their servicing income at that point which becomes more profitable as interest rates climb.

2021-05-24 02:41:22,wallstreetbets,"this actually made me laugh my ass off. Investors don't use that shit but people and hedge funds that constantly trade or use algorithms do to a certain extent. Like i said though long term ""investors"" dont usually in my experience atleast but some traders do.

In the end do what works for you right."
2021-05-24 05:18:22,wallstreetbets,Smart investors and institutions want the price kept low until the buyback is complete.  That way the company takes more shares out with the money.

I'm sure some post their DD on some of these forums. It's just really difficult to differentiate the good from the bad. Also no matter how good you are, trading is probabilistic and you might just get it wrong nomatter how good the entry point seems making it even more difficult to differentiate the good from the bad DD. I've personally been killing it this year trading using simple Bollinger bands, SMAs, support and resistances and looking at some fundamentals."

2021-05-23 21:07:47,wallstreetbets,"So you are not bearish on the sector, just pro Rocket, anti-UWM?
  Selling off the loans lowers their risk.... that seems good to me if your income model is on origination fees and servicing only low risk loans.   I saw that Rocket lowered their guidance, while UWM increased their forward earnings guidance at last earnings call.  I get that there is a big feud between the companies and im not trying to pick sides, just make some $.  I agree that originations will likely play a bigger role for all mortgage companies going forward (compared to refi)  as rates increase and inventory stabilizes.

 I also agree that middle-men draw profit out of the transaction, so ideally eliminating them would improve efficiency for the customers long term (but since when has saving money for a customer been the priority.)  Car companies dont seem to be in a rush to sell direct to consumer, even though im sure most of us would prefer to just pay the price of a car instead of have to haggle- and it would likely increase profit to the car makers. (Tesla was smart to do direct sale but plenty of people still buy Ford through a broker).  
I wouldn't want to be a mortgage broker just starting out as it is a potentially disruptable market, but i see that happening well after the millenials begin to retire and the boomers have all passed away (they seem to really like haggling).  For the next 10 years though i like UWM's profits as a wholesaler, and i like their dividend. 
  Always interested to hear a bear thesis though, because i dont want to accidentally miss something obvious."
2021-05-23 22:25:41,wallstreetbets,"You’re extremely misinformed here

High defect rate on sold loans? UWM services almost all of their loans

Brokers are only for people that need to shop around? Tell that to the hundreds of retail lenders I beat on rate and speed every year.

“No reason to pay any commission to a mortgage broker”…you realize they get paid by the lender right? And any other lender still has an often fatter margin on every deal, meaning more costs passed onto the consumer?

And your last sentence shows you have no clue what you’re talking about. UWM services nearly ALL of their loans.

Piss poor analysis from someone who has no clue what they’re talking about…"
2021-05-24 09:56:55,wallstreetbets,"Yeah - people on this sub somehow don't realize that ""short interest"" and ""options data"" is ALSO technical analysis. Anything that doesn't directly relate to the fundamentals of the company is.

Not to mention the whole charging a penalty if you're with rocket or whoever, which is basically trying to strong-arm which doesn't always work"
2021-05-23 22:30:29,wallstreetbets,"Not really pro Rocket, I just think any retail lender has a better long term business model.  In the next 2 years I don’t think being long UWM will be a bad idea.  Hell I have shares myself.  I just think two important things need to be monitored while you watch the position.  

1.  There is a big push to write software which does the job of a broker at a fraction of the price.  Enter your info into a software package, upload your house’s title, HOI and tax docs and it’ll match that against the AUS (automated underwriting system) that tells lenders whether a loan is eligible for sale to Fannie or Freddie and boom you can see what lender would give you the best rate at that set of criteria.  

2. Rate of origination, since UWM essentially only originates loans any factor that decreases volume is extraordinarily damaging to their bottom line."
2021-05-23 22:27:53,wallstreetbets,"Except that guys wrong on so many fronts. UWM doesn’t sell their loans, they service almost all of them.

Mortgage brokers aren’t any more “middlemen” than any other mortgage lender is. You either pay a mortgage broker or you pay a retail lender that has often bigger margins built in to pay their extensive staff. That’s how brokers can offer better rates than retail lenders."
2021-05-23 22:45:51,wallstreetbets,"I’m sorry my friend but you are the misinformed one.  UWM services almost none of their loans ie they do not collect payments for more than a month or two before selling to Fannie or Freddie.   It seems from your comment you yourself are a broker as you have the intelligence and tenacity of a rapid dog.  And yes I realize that broker commission is paid by the lender, which is pretty obvious... you don’t think that gets rolled into closing costs at all?  It’s bad either way the lender pays all of the commission, which is bad business or the borrower pays some and the lender pays some (which is what actually happens).  It’s funny you can sit there and tell me I don’t know what I’m talking about considering you submit HOI policies with the wrong mortgagee clause for a living."

Watch Rockets wholesale division, I’d bet they shut doors and end up only retail.

If you had to bet on a lender as rates rise, would you bet on Rocket, who mostly focus on refi and have a terrible reputation on purchases, or UWM with brokers who have consistently been more purchase oriented?"
2021-05-23 22:50:11,wallstreetbets,"Bahahahahaha buddy, I know who services the loans I originate

You might be thinking of UWM in years past, but they service nearly ALL of their loans nowadays minus their recent jumbo product they sell off.

You’re probably one of the dumbasses that we laugh about on the origination side because they know nothing about mortgage but got hired as an underwriter II a week ago. You clearly haven’t been in the industry long from your absolute retarded intelligence.

Do you realize that literally every mortgage transaction has a margin? And that those margins tend to be smaller on the broker side? Retail tends to have fat margins to pay for all their levels of management. Trust me, I’ve ran branches on retail side and been on the broker side. Retail is almost always passing more of that cost onto the consumer."
2021-05-23 23:01:05,wallstreetbets,"I have money in UWM but am a bit tired of people with new accounts pushing it when it is not really an options based investment.  It hasn't done anything in the few months its been pushed. 

I dont think strong arming other big swinging dicks like Ishba is doing is smart. 

As a bagholder I hope everyone that bets on it does well, but its been pushed to death here without much movement the last 3 months"

2021-05-24 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Come enjoy the $RIDE 🚀 🚀 🚀 (comparison to $MVIS included) &#x200B;

Disclaimer: this is not financial advice.

I’m big on studying trends and I believe I have found a 2-3 bagger for you retards. I’ve been following $RIDE for about 2 months now, and I noticed the potential for a short squeeze beginning to form last week. I’ve noticed the propensity to squeeze comes from the following criteria:

* Short % of float must be over 20% ([over 28% of $RIDE’s float is short](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/ride); probably closer to 30-32% since it was last updated)
* Small/Mid Cap stocks with considerable growth prospects ($RIDE has a $1.6B market cap) in a hyper-growth EV industry
* Heavily controversial stock, meaning some say it is way overvalued, some say it is undervalued

These stocks tend to be the most volatile. The charts are often comical to even look at (feel free to check out $RIDE’s 6-month chart for reference).

**$MVIS comparison:**

Taking a look at $MVIS, I noticed that Hindenburg research targeted them in a short & distort attack a few months ago.

I actually googled “Hindenburg MVIS” and the second article that popped up was titled “Technically Incompetent Short Seller Hindenburg Makes False Statements About MicroVision.” This bodes very poorly for Hindenburg, as they seem to have started to formulate a lot of their claims out of thin air.

More recently, Hindenburg targeted $RIDE with the same tactics. They called out $RIDE’s pre-orders for their trucks, while almost all EV companies are utilizing pre-orders, this[ has been clear ever since $RIDE went public](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/16/2127140/0/en/Lordstown-Motors-Releases-Business-Updates-Remains-on-Track-to-Begin-Production-of-the-Lordstown-Endurance-in-September-2021.html) last year.

I found a good[ rebuttal post for Hindenburg’s attack on $RIDE](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mkt7qi/the_bullcase_for_lordstown_motors_corporation/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) on this sub from not too long ago as well.

**$RIDE Intro:**

Lordstown Motors ($RIDE) is currently developing their [full-size all electric Endurance truck](https://lordstownmotors.com/pages/endurance). They have an[ experienced management team](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/corporate-governance/management) with multiple execs from companies like Tesla, Volkswagen, GM, Honda, etc; also, GM’s investment in exchange for their [massive 6.2 million square foot facility](https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2020/08/03/gm-invest-ev-maker-lordstown-motors/5571007002/) helped them hit the ground running. They are targeting commercial fleets and government contracts with their truck initially. Their trucks will be $45,000 after tax credits and get a 75mpg equivalent. They also will require very little maintenance as they utilize true 4 wheel drive with hub motors in each wheel.

Discussing their[ full-year 2020 results](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2020) on March 17th, $RIDE management confirmed that “Timeline to Start of Production (SoP) in September 2021 remains on track, with beta prototype build underway and the first beta vehicles to be ready by the end of March; vehicles to be sent for durability, crash, validation, and lighting testing with various partners and to early initial customers for feedback.”

They have[ shown their betas to the public](https://twitter.com/LordstownMotors/status/1377350607518920705?s=20) as well.

**Ohio’s Endorsement of LMC:** 🚀 🚀 🚀

[U.S. Rep. Tim Ryan](https://www.cleveland.com/business/2021/03/is-lordstown-motors-for-real-ohio-is-betting-big-on-the-electric-truck-startup.html), a Democrat who represents the Youngstown, OH area and is running for the senate currently, didn’t mince words about the (Hindenburg) short-seller report. He called it “‘bull\*\*\*\*. I mean it was just to me, it seemed like a hatchet job for (short-sellers) to make money,” he said. “And look, I mean (Lordstown) is threatening the status quo. And a lot of people are going to bet against them, figuratively and literally. It comes with the territory. You don’t get to the top of the mountain without a bunch of people trying to drag you down.”

[Secretary of State Frank LaRose](https://www.vindy.com/news/local-news/2021/03/ceo-extols-positives-of-lordstown-motors-on-heels-of-critical-report/): “I think what this is, is an opportunity to take a challenging circumstance from just a few years ago and turn it into a truly unique and amazing opportunity for not right here in the Youngstown area — Voltage Valley as we like to call it — but all over Ohio.”

[Ohio Governor Mike Dewine:](https://www.cleveland.com/open/2020/06/gov-mike-dewine-said-he-expects-success-from-lordstown-plant-in-first-normal-press-conference-during-pandemic.html) “Really, this is the future,” DeWine said of the truck and the facility, where he got a private tour. “I think this truck has a great competitive advantage over its competitors.”

[Senator Michael Rulli](https://www.cleveland.com/business/2021/03/is-lordstown-motors-for-real-ohio-is-betting-big-on-the-electric-truck-startup.html), the Republican state senator from the area, has introduced several bills in Ohio aimed at helping the electric-vehicle industry, said he’s visited the (Lordstown) plant recently. He said he’s seen the company’s robotic assembly line putting together a series of 57 betas. Based on what he’s seen, Rulli said he thinks Lordstown Motors will be producing thousands of Endurance trucks sometime this year or perhaps early next year. “They’re way way way far along,” he said. “Whoever wrote that article (Hindenburg) has never been in that (Lordstown) plant. That is a fact. Anyone who was in that plant would read that article and think it was garbage.”

**I WILL NOW SCREAM IT FOR ALL OF YOU: ALL OF THESE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TO $RIDE’S**[ **MASSIVE 6.2 MILLION SQUARE FOOT FACILITY**](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/17/lordstown-motors-races-to-revive-shuttered-ohio-gm-plant.html)**. $RIDE IS LEGIT AND WILL BE PRODUCING ELECTRIC PICK-UP TRUCKS FOR COMMERCIAL FLEET CUSTOMERS IN JUST 4 MONTHS.**

They also [recently announced “Lordstown Week”](https://businessjournaldaily.com/lordstown-motors-stock-climbs-14-on-lordstown-week-announcement/) in mid June for analysts, customers, partners, and investors to attend. This will silence all of the short-sellers, lawsuits, and FUD.

$RIDE has an earnings call tomorrow 5/24 where they will be giving updates on crash testing. If they announce they are still on track for mass production in September, this will be HUGE.

**$RIDE Upcoming Catalysts include:**

* [Earnings call tomorrow 5/24](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-announces-timing-first-quarter-2021-financial) to discuss updates on crash testing and timeline to production.
* [Department of energy Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing (ATVM) loan](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1759546/000110465921037690/tm2110022d1_ex99-1.htm), which should be announced by the end of Q2 2021 (literally any day now).
* [Release of ERV in conjunction with Camping World](https://gmauthority.com/blog/2021/01/lordstown-motors-to-reveal-electric-commercial-van-this-summer/), which is expected next month, and the[ Camping World CEO has already leaked a sneak peak](https://twitter.com/marcuslemonis/status/1379433681995984905?s=20) of it.
* Beta production updates and contracts with commercial fleets.

**Summary:**

$MVIS moved from $10 to $27 in just a couple of days, and I believe $RIDE is about to make a similar move from $10 back to $20+ with their earnings call being tomorrow after-hours.

EVs are front and center, and the government is pushing for the adoption of EVs in such a big way that you’d be a fool not to own a piece of the pie.

$RIDE has one of the lowest market caps out of all of the EV plays, and they are the closest to fully automated mass production (this September).

Position: 5 Jan 2023 calls w/ a $40 strike. I’m planning to buy more tomorrow before earnings.

**TL;DR:**

$RIDE stock has incredibly high upside, and I think it’s only a matter of time until it squeezes back up to the $20’s. I have been following the chart for a while now, and I believe institutions are currently loading up before this gets squeezed back up.

A major reason GM basically gave them their factory, which isn’t really talked about much, is Lordstown agreed to give GM their EV credits.  That gives GM a huge financial incentive to ensure LMC is successful.  LMC hired the same man who got Tesla to production.  I’m Bullish on the stock."

2021-05-24 07:22:04,wallstreetbets,When they announce receiving the $200mm government loan this stock will open at $50 a share.
2021-05-23 22:33:43,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the article. I have been investing and tracking RIDE since it was still DPHC. I invested a bit too early and my average is now $17 and I am holding 4200 shares.

I wanted to post here for a few times about RIDE but got rejected by bots. I hope more people can look into this Tesla2.0 .

The sales of Pickup truck in Q4 2020 surpassed Sedans for the first time in US. EV Pickup truck is the future warzone of EV, not supercars, not low cost EVs for your grandma.

Ford spent millions of PR fund on the unveal of F150 Lightning and invited the president to test drive. You can consider it as a candidate of Democrats.

Endurance also got the blessings of GOP. Donald Trump and Pence help promoted Endurance of RIDE while they are still leading the country back to prosperity.

No matter how the county's economy grow under Biden's adminstration, EV Pickup trucks will still be a focus of the country. Fleets especially need a lower running cost and maintenance cost during economy recovery so that they can run their business more efficiently than their competitors. And if economy goes down because of Biden' administration, fleet managers will also need a lower running cost more than before.

And if you look at the ICE Full Size Pickup trucks market, you can see that even the worst performing Full Size pickup trucks as rated by Consumer Reports, they still got tens of thousands of purchases in 2020.
https://www.motorbiscuit.com/2020-pickup-trucks-these-are-the-worst-of-the-year/

According to the current information, RIDE will be the ONLY Full Size EV Pickup Truck on market from Sept 2021 - Q2 2022, which gives it 6-9 months of leading time ahead of Ford F150 Lightning.

RIDE may not be the BEST of the BEST Full Size EV pickup truck in the world, but its Hub Motors Innovation, the bravery and courage of changing the status quo and challenging the giants is the reason for me to invest in this company."
2021-05-23 22:23:58,wallstreetbets,Bunch of BSers in this thread. Plenty of new accounts with shitload of negative karma trying to push this. Buyer beware
2021-05-24 09:14:32,wallstreetbets,250 shares.
2021-05-24 11:06:10,wallstreetbets,"I'm sort of on the same page.   
Been following for 2 months or so and got tempted for 1400 shares at slightly above 11 average.   
Thing is, it went lower than I ever though possible and I have been waiting for the squeeze ever since. Those 3-4 days it went up 70% felt great, but it came back down pretty quick and 8s are now, not far-fetched.   
I think a ""real squeeze"" will only happen when a substantial milestone is achieved and is advertised effectively. Spread far and wide. Word gets out.   
The Hindenburg (or whatever the F they're called) report was a hit-piece. That alone, merits an epic short-squeeze. You reap what you sow.  
It can run like galloping horses for the 3 reasons you state... I'm just wondering when? Lordstown needs to provide the ammo and that is what is missing right now.

Thank you for the audience. It is my first time posting on Reddit. Lot more people here than Yahoo, it seems."
2021-05-24 16:30:27,wallstreetbets,The RIDE that never happened!
2021-05-24 16:45:34,wallstreetbets,That's the cue to sell boys
2021-05-23 23:03:47,wallstreetbets,What’s the value of the squeeze target?
2021-05-24 01:14:58,wallstreetbets,Bots all of you
2021-05-24 01:55:30,wallstreetbets,"so what you're saying is that all of these politicians who have a vested interest in keeping jobs in Ohio have only positive things to say about RIDE

fascinating."
2021-05-24 07:15:49,wallstreetbets,Short interest rate to borrow shares was 57% last friday. Lul RIDE to the moon
2021-05-24 09:19:48,wallstreetbets,"Oh god... another ""squeeze candidate"": A crappy company that faked 99% of pre-orders to create fictional demand, but people will pile into anyways for no reason and ignore that fact. Also, a healthy cult following due to the ""screw the shorts"" campaign of Feb-March since it was the  target of a short report (that was NEVER responded too, FYI, besides a childish ""haters gonna hate"" statement), and generated a massive, massive class of bagholders.

&#x200B;

I made my money shorting this POS well above $14, I'm never touching it again. Good luck tho"
2021-05-24 00:11:23,wallstreetbets,"Yeah hidenburgs statement about mvis is 100% correct there is no distortion or technical incompetence, and everything they said about ride is correct too. They mislead investors into thinking that pre-orders with refundable deposits were real.

BUT, I made a lot of money last week on RIDE and fundamentals matter little in today's markets. Everything is controlled by options activity.

Last week there was significant put decay, can't wait for my gamma indicator to update tomorrow to see what next week looks like.

I'm with you!"
2021-05-24 01:42:52,wallstreetbets,">$RIDE has one of the lowest market caps out of all of the EV plays, and they are the closest to fully automated mass production (this September).

bullshit"
2021-05-24 00:30:37,wallstreetbets,"Ummmmm

This is the company that the CEO lied about orders and their road test prototype caught fire 10 minutes after it rolled out the door earlier this year.  This company is a turd until they can show they aren't just another NKLA.

2021-05-23 21:53:17,wallstreetbets,Mods?? Why was this removed?
2021-05-23 23:55:18,wallstreetbets,Fords going to eat their lunch. Fords vehicle costs 12k cheaper than Endurance. Only thing $RIDE has going for it is hitting the market months in advance.
2021-05-23 20:31:51,wallstreetbets,"no dealerships, showrooms or service centers, bullshit preorders, an ancient 1960's factory and unproven technology (unsprung in-hub motors).  dead already"

2021-05-24 12:02:16,wallstreetbets,Expect that fleets don't pay MSRP. Ford can't survive on fleet sales. And that's where LMC has the advantage.

The Endurance skateboard is new, as told Steve Burns.

2021-05-23 23:18:23,wallstreetbets,"Why does anyone care about the earnings call? They have no revenue. The only thing you find out is their cash burn rate. But it is a no-win. If it is too fast the stock will fall, if it is too slow then questions will abound about them gearing up for production with the significant costs involved. Whatever, they are going to be asked hard questions  about their timeline and what happened at the SF250 and they will not have good answers (as simply put, barring a miracle there are no good answers) and the stock will tank Tuesday."

2021-05-23 23:22:49,wallstreetbets,"Strange amount of bullish posts from usernames that all follow the same generic format (Random Word)(Random Word)(4 numbers)

First thing I noticed.

edit * examples 

ApprehensiveBee4199 - I’m in. Lordstown Motors 🚀🚀🚀🚀


InternetUnusual5940 - Totally we can run this to the moon. I'm getting on board


EveningMind5809 - I’m long on this company I believe they have great long term potential. I also agree with OP this is primed for a short squeeze. I think there’s many folks shorting them that don’t know the real potential and what positive news could result in. Many just read Hindenburgs report and took it at face value.


PureSatisfaction4670 - Let’s go!!! Fingers crossed for moon news Monday!!!


Past-Olive-8732 - The shorts have laid out all their cards and LTM is knocking them down 1 by 1. Shorts will hit them for cash burn as if it’s not expected. But they drove this down so much that it doesn’t make sense. LTM just has to start delivering vehicles this year and it’s SP is going up 3x or more


Superb-Ad-9663 - I am right there with you at 10k shares ⚡️⚡️⚡️💪💪💪"
2021-05-23 20:04:04,wallstreetbets,"The plant can produce 600,000 vehicles per year... literally starting this year (end of September)

All this stock needs is to restore confidence... real orders, real deadlines  being met, real trucks coming off the assembly line... and happy customers.

They will be the first EV pickup to market, this is going to be huge."
2021-05-23 21:29:39,wallstreetbets,"Your first point, it doesn't.  It needs to capture market share, it doesn't need to capture the whole fucking market. if it only sells 200k trucks to Ford's 600k the only one who would consider that a failure would be you and the shorts. As for production, the plant was producing 600k Cruzes at its peak. And that's a vehicle with a full drive train, exhaust, fuel system etc.  The Endurance has about 1/4 of that to install. 

As for pricing.  Ford. Fucking. Lied.  The truck *starts* at 39.9k.  That's without the extended range package, the towing package, and all the little extras that you would need to pay for to get a vehicle with comparable specs to the Endurance.  And that's if you could find a base model Lightning for sale.  According to Ford, the F150 LT starts at 28.9k.  Know anyone who paid less than 40k for a new F150?  Fuck, when I tried to order one with base specs, it quoted me a price of 35k.  Im sure somewhere there's a 2021 F150 selling for under 30k.  But it aint to you, me or damn near anyone who isn't in on that scam.

As for the bagholders being between 8-30.  That's a hell of a fucking spread buddy.  If it hits 30 over the next two weeks, that's a 200% gain. Sure it isn't GameStop, but honestly, what is out there?  I get that  this sub is all about yolo'ing your life savings, your wife's life savings, and whatever your wife's boyfriend gives you as an allowance into a stock you're absolutely convinced is gonna moon, but shitting on 200% is kinda dumb"
2021-05-23 20:06:59,wallstreetbets,So people who bought at 8 are bag holders in your opinion? When was the last time you checked the PPS? Not a very intelligent FUD attempt

2021-05-24 14:30:53,wallstreetbets,"I suspect up to 75% of those pre-orders were not-so-serious (or worse).  That leaves 25k serious orders or $1.3B in revenue to start.   And that was pre-beta, pre GM selling, pre RV, and pre-ability to mfg for other EVs."
2021-05-24 10:59:38,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, when Steve-Boi sang ""Hate Hate Hate"" like Taylor Swift as a counter to the Short-Seller report, i thought that was an early April Fools joke.

But as it turned out, the CEO is a clown anyway, so i guess the style of answer shouldnt have suprised anybody"
2021-05-24 10:05:32,wallstreetbets,Is Ford misleading investors when they allege to have 40K preorders as well? $100 refundable deposits. Same as Tesla and every other EV player

2021-05-24 00:44:04,wallstreetbets,If you had really been paying attention you'd know the report has no merit. Watch the ER tomorrow if you have doubts.
2021-05-24 18:36:35,wallstreetbets,"If you listened to the earnings call there was actually a lot of good stuff. The media spins everything so negatively, I’ve never seen anything like it. They said they have 30,000 purchase agreements. I was very encouraged from the call today and am so long on this company."
2021-05-23 20:01:42,wallstreetbets,"Assuming they start production at the end of September, they only need to produce about 24 trucks a day to meet there production target for 2021.  Very doable, in my opinion."
2021-05-23 23:30:21,wallstreetbets,"Do you know who is the President of $RIDE ?  He was the Director of Manufacturing of Tesla. Do you think your timeline is more reasonable than the one given out by this guy? 

The Endurance chassis's history starts from the days that Steve Burns is still CEO of $WKHS while they are designing W-15. They have been testing the truck for more than 3 years, even longer than the dev time of F150 Lightning. 

Beta truck manufacturing  is NOT used for gauging user's feedback, which should be done at Alpha phase. Beta is a stage used for testing manufacturing capabilities, quality control, final risk discovery and yield predictions. Your comments are based on wrong assumptions of what Beta production stage is used for."
2021-05-23 20:56:29,wallstreetbets,So you have to make a lot of stupid comments to seem more credible? I’m new but everyone starts somewhere.

2021-05-24 00:39:30,wallstreetbets,Ford's cheaper truck does not compare to how the Endurance comes stock. It's a low low profit truck of which very few will be built. Makes for good press though.
2021-05-24 12:14:54,wallstreetbets,"Ford will sell less gas engine f150 for probably a lower profit margin electric f150. Not good. They’re new to EV as well. It’s like cannibalism, no?"
2021-05-23 21:43:13,wallstreetbets,Same as Tesla
2021-05-23 23:40:24,wallstreetbets,"All showrooms and Rep offices of Camping World will be the service centers of $RIDE according the partnership deal. Also most of the preorders are placed by dealers already.

Your comment is just showed your ignorance. Not hard to search for ""Lordstown Service Centers"" on Google right?

2021-05-24 07:53:34,wallstreetbets,Good or bad?
2021-05-24 10:28:32,wallstreetbets,source?
2021-05-24 08:32:44,wallstreetbets,You’re right. Thanks for correction 🙂
2021-05-23 20:35:52,wallstreetbets,"Check this out here https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1alRUqx9UX8 - for your concerns. The company that builds/designed the hub motors is Elaphe. They have tested these motors, and refined them for many years. Some testing has been over 100,000 miles on vehicles. Scroll through the Elaphe videos here - https://m.youtube.com/channel/UCs_sg7uX3UHVGrB7zEoutow. To my knowledge these motors will be built in house at Lordstown Motors... Go $RIDE! 🚀📈🛻"

2021-05-24 07:54:02,wallstreetbets,No good answers so it should already be priced in right?
2021-05-24 07:21:57,wallstreetbets,"It is because if seeing there is a strong competitor supported by Democrats,  Republicans will give more support to RIDE to show that not only Democrats can help the EV industry. 

In Ohio, a Republicans State, has done a lot of publicity for Voltage Valley, which will be promoted as the fulfilled promises of Donald Trump. i.e. bring back Lordstown's  jobs by building a greater car manufacturing plant.

You can see Ford vs Lordstown as a Democrats vs Republicans PR war."
2021-05-24 02:12:16,wallstreetbets,Exactly. Thanks for grouping those. What a shame we have to keep an eye out for shit like that

2021-05-23 20:25:43,wallstreetbets,"I agree they have the facilities but September feels so close considering it looks like the betas still have a decent amount of fine tuning to do. 

If they can get a working product on the market before F and bring down their price point before the Lightning hits market (expected to be priced about 10% cheaper than LTM) I agree they have potential to get back up. It will be a rocky road though with the sharp decline (re - multiple people got burned in the last 6 months).

Depending on their guidance tomorrow I may reconsider opening a small position again"
2021-05-23 23:12:09,wallstreetbets,"Rivian has actually delivered vans to Amazon for testing. That is perhaps just a ""wee"" bit further than what LMC has accomplished."

2021-05-24 18:44:43,wallstreetbets,Why do you think their reports of purchase agreements are any different than the claims they’ve made about those in the past?

don't just bluff"
2021-05-23 20:31:50,wallstreetbets,Hindenburg did an excellent report on this scam.  Everything in that report was true
2021-05-24 12:54:21,wallstreetbets,Not a rumor. They said they will be available soon to order.

2021-05-24 16:22:57,wallstreetbets,wait I think im autistic. Its actually 779 million. My fault
2021-05-24 09:37:17,wallstreetbets,"No worries, I just don't want some cunt heading down to Lordstown next week, seeing nobody there, and shorting the stock to a nickel."
2021-05-23 20:56:32,wallstreetbets,"Of particular interest is the thermal imaging of the motor assembly prior to being dunked in salt water. That test happened after running the motor under load in a previous test which increases the temperature of the unit. Increased temperature means thermal expansion, which means more potential for water ingress.

Elaphe has iterated the design based on very harsh testing conditions. There's a ton of cool engineering in these motors and I'm excited to see how they fare in real world applications. I suspect their durability will be impressive."
2021-05-24 01:45:45,wallstreetbets,Why would you want to put windings or anything in the wheels? That's unsprung weight. Putting motors in the car and connecting with an axle works.
2021-05-24 05:07:01,wallstreetbets,That as well is my understanding.
2021-05-24 09:26:48,wallstreetbets,"They're pre revenue, so I'm not expecting to see a profit. I just want to know if they're still on track to sell some trucks this year. That's what I care about most."
2021-05-23 22:42:20,wallstreetbets,Let’s see it then
2021-05-24 16:51:56,wallstreetbets,Im shocked you can afford the dildo
2021-05-24 07:03:06,wallstreetbets,Haha yea this drinking fountain is for people with only 2 digits. Hey yeah! Lol
2021-05-24 08:55:39,wallstreetbets,I'm not bashing users. I noticed something strange and commented on it. If there is nothing to it then there is nothing to it. I stand by my oberservation that it is strange.
2021-05-23 20:44:09,wallstreetbets,"It's only the base model lightning that is cheaper than the Endurance. And they were very vague on what that was... it's hard to debate a future truck and future price point (without specs) with the current specs and pricing of the Endurance. No doubt Ford will produce a reliable and formidable product, but that will just raise the profile of all EV trucks imo. It legitimizes EVs to even the biggest skeptics (and the hicks, so to speak)"
2021-05-24 19:24:03,wallstreetbets,Appreciate the kind words. I have been invested since the DPHC days. Time will tell if I’m right or wrong!
2021-05-24 18:48:24,wallstreetbets,"You’re right that there’s no way to verify it. I guess only time will tell! Invest or don’t invest, I’m just a big believer in the company and everyone can have their own opinions."
2021-05-23 21:30:31,wallstreetbets,You are already in a very enviable stock position. All the best to you.
2021-05-23 20:25:36,wallstreetbets,IMO once Lordstown week comes around that should get the SP over $10.
2021-05-24 01:17:41,wallstreetbets,"Ford's 40k truck is a lot weaker. But, I agree they'll build good trucks, just not many cheap ones. At best, they'll be going dollar for dollar with LMC on price. Simply too little profit for them to survive as a company otherwise.

There's plenty of room in the market for LMC. They don't automatically go out of business just because Ford showed their truck. Did you somehow think they'd never build one? Like I said, if Ford doesn't sell a lot of high profit vehicles they go under. That's why their stock price has been low for so long. They have a lot of debt and legacy costs to service."
2021-05-24 12:23:02,wallstreetbets,I don’t have to work at Walmart to know they are the king of retail. I don’t work at Krispy Kreme to know the original glazed is da bomb! It’s obvious.
2021-05-23 23:45:11,wallstreetbets,"Sorry it is Ford trying to compete with $RIDE.
They started way earlier than Ford did.

So you are talking about a car company must build high price handbuilt cars when they start right? What an interesting economic theory. So Nio Rivian Li XPEV should all be dead right? They all use robots."
2021-05-23 23:12:20,wallstreetbets,Hindenburg report said ex employee said production was 3 to 4 years away.  They are still on track for Sept 2021.  What proof do you have that “everything Hindenburg said was true”?
2021-05-24 13:33:29,wallstreetbets,Nice!
2021-05-24 14:27:39,wallstreetbets,I spoke with the fleet manager. they are writing purchase orders now for a December delivery.

Last time on this ride I sold DPHC for $30 after buy-in around $10ish. Please let it do that again. If you buy it, it will come. I just like the stock. A lot."

2021-05-23 23:05:51,wallstreetbets,So far the first truck caught on fire after driving 10 miles. The second one drove slowly through sand for 40 miles before calling it quits. Don't be excited. Be terrified if you actually hold any investment in this company.
2021-05-24 04:57:41,wallstreetbets,"Ok, go invest in Tesla than! Do your research about ""unsprung weight"""

2021-05-23 22:52:55,wallstreetbets,Won’t let me attach a photo on a reply.
2021-05-24 07:43:27,wallstreetbets,"I feel like Ford felt the need to undercut the price and put the PR out just prior to LM releasing good news. A way to tell their current fleet owners, hang in a little longer and you can buy an EV truck from your Ford dealer even cheaper. But you know Ford will focus on their high end trucks first as they are more profitable.  And then they will keep telling customers, hang on, just a few more months."
2021-05-24 09:08:18,wallstreetbets,"A lot weaker is an overstatement. It's less than 100 miles diff

&#x200B;

You do realize stock price has 0 relevance. It's the market cap you should be looking at."
2021-05-24 13:02:46,wallstreetbets,"You do need to be working at Wal-mart to know how there profits work on each item though.   


But you're right, you don't need to be at Ford to know that they are one of the top Automotive company and LMC is in big trouble."
2021-05-24 08:52:40,wallstreetbets,"I stand corrected, I forgot how many Rivians I see driving around everyday"
2021-05-24 18:23:03,wallstreetbets,Here's hoping bud. I just want a lil financial independence. I'm already 36 so I don't think I'll be retiring at 38 haha.

Drove 40 miles through the Baja 250 where gasoline trucks get 1-2 MPG.

The user above is actually notorious for seeking out $RIDE threads to post FUD."
2021-05-24 12:56:28,wallstreetbets,"You fanboys are always hilarious. “Wah he noticed the obvious problem, downvote!”"
2021-05-23 21:27:55,wallstreetbets,"I have made a mistake, I am sorry I guess I was thinking about something else."
2021-05-23 22:53:12,wallstreetbets,Use imgur…
2021-05-24 09:51:06,wallstreetbets,"My point is that if Ford builds a 40k truck it won't be competing with LMC for fleet sales. The specs are too weak. The legacy players make their money on higher end trucks sold to consumers. That is the same reason GM and Ford have reduced rental fleet sales. They have tremendous costs to cover.

LMC is in a totally different place. Low overhead and going after a specific market segment. They have a solid plan, but they must execute and sell quality trucks to get a foothold.

Market cap means nothing in this conversation. It's apples to oranges and is nothing more than a talking point.

I own both Ford and GM stock, but not for the same reason I own LMC. They're industry slatwarts. I view $RIDE as a growth stock and accept the inherent additional risk."
2021-05-24 18:28:41,wallstreetbets,Man a couple years of this craziness is all you need. Just have to get lucky a couple times. Good luck my friend. Never dreamed I would be financially independent at this age.
2021-05-24 09:51:37,wallstreetbets,"> apples to oranges

But you can still compare them."
2021-05-24 10:52:12,wallstreetbets,"You keep saying the ford trucks are going to be TOO weak. They are marginally weaker at best but can still perform the same jobs as the endurance at a 12k cheaper price point. 

You also tout that $RIDE is going to short squeeze every week, so I would take everything you say with a grain of salt since you are heavily biased."
2021-05-24 10:52:28,wallstreetbets,Market caps are hard when your blinded by your own bias.
2021-05-24 09:58:57,wallstreetbets,"Sure, but what relevant conclusions can you draw?"
2021-05-24 11:19:46,wallstreetbets,"I'm only saying the specs of Ford's 40k truck are weak when compared to the Endurance. They're 2 different trucks. For a comparable truck from Ford you'll pay as much or more than an Endurance. But it doesn't mean that Ford's cheaper truck won't work for some folks.

I only mention the possibility of a short squeeze because the short interest is significant, and that fact is important to some investors. Other than that, I'm holding long hoping LMC will be a good or great growth stock.

I've already disclosed previously that I have shares, so it shouldn't be too hard to figure out that also means I have a bias."
2021-05-24 11:26:23,wallstreetbets,"You keep using the word ""weak"". Fords 50k truck blows Endurance out of the water in-terms of distance. 

Your bias is very clear."
2021-05-24 11:40:17,wallstreetbets,"You're right, dense is the word I should be using..."
2021-05-24 11:47:43,wallstreetbets,Yes. Dense truck that can travel further than Endurance at the same price point. No-brainer for consumers and fleet owners.

2021-05-23 21:38:14,wallstreetbets,"During my stint as an Uber driver, I had this regular who was a stripper, a black girl who was paying her way through school by dancing at the only topless club in town. One night she told me she’d be taking next week off, so she could go meet her fiancees family. The craziest part of the story, is that her fiancée was an Amish guy who she met while working. She said as soon as he walked into the strip club he walked right over to her and told her she was the most beautiful creature he’d ever seen and they’d been together ever since. She was so nervous about meeting his family, she had to buy new outfits that covered her from the neck down because nothing she owned was modest enough. I guess my point is that if some Amish Chad isn’t afraid to introduce his black stripper girlfriend to his entire family, what the fuck is holding you back from living the life you want to live? Get out there and fuck shit up this week.

They buy the dip, but they over buy it.  They make money until a bear market.  Then they wipe out half their gains chasing a dip that keeps dipping.  Then they get scared, go quiet in the forums and discord, and pull into cash.

It is *exactly* at this moment that you want to go long.  Early in a recovery from a correction moderately OTM leaps are best - good gains on the upside and won't slice your fingers off if the dip keeps dipping.  You can be high IQ and watch order flows to figure out when this is, or you can just wait for fin-twit bulls to go silent."

Meanwhile, I overheard staff mention that all resort inventory is completely booked for the next two weeks solid - not a single room available on property - and that they are having trouble both hiring and ramping people up. There was also speculation on the issue of lack of specialized knowledge surrounding furloughed pyrotechnicians, and some practice events they were doing late at night to get warmed back up.

As for masks, the guests are beginning to flagrantly disregard the rules and many of the staff clearly don’t enjoy the role of “enforcer”, making cynical comments about taking last breaths of freedom before heading indoors.

Make of that what you will, but it makes me so bullish horns are growing out of my forehead."

Sell everything for lunch break

Buy calls at 1:15

Sell calls at 1:30

Buy both calls and puts at 2:27

Buy calls at 3:30

The decay totally takes care of the rest. If you look at a 1 year + chart of UVXY, it's hard to find any 4 month period where if you were get puts in at a peak or even peak-ish moment and then 4 months later there isn't at least a few days where your put would have been well ITM. now, if the VIX settles to neutral as it's asymptotic trend seems to be doing, and/or we head for a consistently down market, this strategy doesn't work. But even in a super choppy up/down market, the decay factor of placing puts on a highly leveraged fund has been working well!

Now TDA interface all day yesterday showed I made like 5.85 or something while think or swim had me losing 40ish dollars on the transaction.

This event enables investors to understand that this is a real business shaping up with real potential. Market cap is just 5 B. It's the event which nndm had with 3d printers and opened at 5x. Dont be surprised if spce does open up at 40 tomorrow. Really dont get surprised.  That's just tomorrow's open. In one month it can go till 80 plus as well..

I remember when I was with Special Forces. Seems a thousand centuries ago. We went into a camp to inoculate the children. We left the camp after we had inoculated the children for Polio, and this old man came running after us and he was crying. He couldn’t see.

We went back there and they had come and hacked off every inoculated arm. There they were in a pile. A pile of little arms.

And I remember… I… I… I cried. I wept like some grandmother. I wanted to tear my teeth out. I didn’t know what I wanted to do.

And I want to remember it. I never want to forget it. I never want to forget. And then I realized… like I was shot… like I was shot with a diamond… a diamond bullet right through my forehead. And I thought:

My God… the genius of that. The genius. The will to do that. Perfect, genuine, complete, crystalline, pure.

Is this not what is happening with the housing market?  People were stuck home and never went out which caused people to save a bunch of money, they invested this money which caused them to acquire more wealth, then stimulus came, and a bunch of people took all this money to buy a house.

2021-05-24 03:00:34,wallstreetbets,"In the early 19th century, Banks across the country struggled to back their paper money with specie reserves. Instead of a national currency like the United States now has in place each Bank could print their own money. This allowed numerous ""wildcat"" banks to pop up as the movement west occured, but problems arose due to the policies on paper money. Paper money was unregulated at the time, which eventually lead to Andrew Jackson's war on the banks of the United States."

2021-05-23 21:49:06,wallstreetbets, I've heard of this before. You bought a put and now you're gay. Have you noticed other symptoms like growing fur and claws?
2021-05-23 21:46:42,wallstreetbets,"You need to buy 100 shares at 415 or $41,500.

If you bought to open you'll be just fine😘"
2021-05-23 22:30:19,wallstreetbets,"SPY closed at $414.94 and your put strike was $415 which means that put was in the money by $0.06/share. TDA was showing that you made $0.06\*100 = $6.00 ($5.85 could be due to fees etc.) based on the closing price of $414.94.

In after market SPY $415.46, now if you (or your broker) needs to buy 100 SPY for assignment they need to buy it from market. Based on the Friday AH price you need $(415.46-415.00)\*100 = $45 above the strike price of $415 to deliver those shares to the put writer, don't worry $415/share will be paid by the put writer, you just need whatever obove that $415 is. That $45 is the loss one broker was showing based on AH price.

When you wrote this comment US 500 future was up by 0.33%. Based on future, current theoretical SPY price is 414.94 + (414.94\*0.0033) = $416.3. Now if your broker needs to buy SPY for assignment, they (ultimately you) need to pay $1.3\*100 = $130 more. This was the reason you were seeing $125 or $105 loss.

If SPY gap up tomorrow by whatever amount your loss will be that gap up difference times 100. Which means opening at $420 and your theoretical loss of $500.

These are only valid if assignment happens which is probably likely. Also, I am assuming that put expiry was on last Friday."
2021-05-23 21:48:13,wallstreetbets,"so the expiration was 0dte

and SPY closed under your strike and you let it go through

so you're short the market $42,000. you are short 100 shares of SPY.

i'm assuming you didn't have any SPY shares for this play.

i think I did that right in my head. to close your new position, just buy to close 100 shares SPY."

2021-05-23 20:16:58,wallstreetbets,"Pretty much no one knows what caused the housing bubble. 

It’s probably a complex combination of a million different factors. That being said, I HIGHLY doubt it had anything to do with the stimulus or saving money by staying at home. 

I think it is a combination of interest rates, foreclosure moratorium, and (probably most importantly) lack of inventory due to people not selling during the pandemic (for a bunch of reasons)."
2021-05-23 20:27:27,wallstreetbets,Housing is up because rates are down. A 1% drop in interest over 30 years is the same as bidding up a house 30% over it's value or some shit.
2021-05-23 20:27:49,wallstreetbets,"This is too political of a discussion to really get into, because the nature of ""wealth inequality"" and how or even whether to address it heavily influences the outcome of a wage increase.

There's more to it than ""wage go up, inflation go up"" but people with political convictions are rather tied to their respective evidence sets."
2021-05-23 20:29:01,wallstreetbets,"The point is to remember that capitalism basically starts with the enclosure of public land, making previously public land private. You mention “landlords” in your post: that is the problem

Now, we must work to live on the very earth and ground we walk. This forces almost every person into wage servitude In order to gain property/rent.

2021-05-24 01:58:39,wallstreetbets,Really bad idea. Are you deliberately trying to mislead people? It spiked from $1 to $30s as part of an extreme anomalous event - the George Floyd riots/protests. It was a push to support black owned businesses. Most obvious short ever - clearly couldn’t maintain that value. To suggest that it’s a value play now cause it once went into the 30’s is the dumbest shit I’ve ever seen on WSB
2021-05-24 01:50:14,wallstreetbets,"
Hello! You have made the mistake of writing ""ect"" instead of ""etc.""

""Ect"" is a common misspelling of ""etc,"" an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase ""et cetera."" Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&c.**, **&c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as ""et"" to ""and"" + ""cetera"" to ""the rest;"" a literal translation to ""and the rest"" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase.

2021-05-23 23:47:53,wallstreetbets,"tqqq's option chain calculus/IV takes into account it's decay. But for 1 or 2 (or heaven forbid, three) days in a row positive, there is no decay and the payoff is better. I've done the math, and for very short plays, or for about 2:1 positive: negative days over time (or3:1 positive/negative % up:down of the daq) it's a slightly better play. for longer than 5 days, for sure qqq is the better play, unless you get like 4:1 or 5:0 good days:bad.

edit: tldr: Tqqq is better if there is no decay, hence for a 1 or 2 day play it's better."

2021-05-23 23:36:58,wallstreetbets,Let’s say GME spikes on the T+x days coming up. How much % gain are you looking to make off this play? I personally believe GME will have a slight dip tomorrow and was planning on getting some weeklies to sell on the IV run up I see coming this week. How much % wise difference would it be if I was to buy a far OTM LEAP like you instead of a closer strike FD? I have the same idea as you in regards to selling off the crazy upcoming IV and you seem to have much more knowledge than me so I’m curious to hear what you have to say
2021-05-23 23:41:56,wallstreetbets,Smart. Wait for the IV to drop because surely it won't drop any further. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|facepalm)

looks like you’re winning right now, I hope you exit with profit👌

Just don’t let the Greeks fk you over 🥺"
2021-05-23 23:40:49,wallstreetbets,Citadel is selling these options. They're making a fortune on idiots. I guess you could trade these options and make money knowing some other idiot will buy them... but the squeeze is over. No one is shorting GME.  There is no potential $950 in sight.

2021-05-24 13:36:49,wallstreetbets,"you, them all of us."
2021-05-24 01:34:25,wallstreetbets,"It’s so when GME is worth millions (far before Jan 2023), OP will be able to unload the contracts at a massive profit to SHFs who will be executing them immediately."
2021-05-24 01:35:54,wallstreetbets,Guessing it’s a pure Vega play.  LEAPS are very sensitive to IV spikes.  Even a mini squeeze to say $250 will spike these calls substantially.
2021-05-24 08:30:21,wallstreetbets,"Nobody buy calls. Only shares and hold. Shortest DD you’ll get. You’ll lose your money buying calls, they have Pay For Order Flow and can see everyone’s calls and puts and you sell limits/buy limits. They know when to crash it. Safest thing to do is just buy shares and hold them to bleed them from liquidity till they are margin called and sends this rocket to Alpha Centauri."
2021-05-24 00:54:46,wallstreetbets,Honestly if you believe in the mooning this is 100x smarter than buying shares. Let the cattle buy shares.

2021-05-24 02:15:27,wallstreetbets,Yeah but near term IV has a little effect on 2 year leaps
2021-05-23 20:44:48,wallstreetbets,They aren’t FD’s so I think you’re good.
2021-05-24 13:56:52,wallstreetbets,can we get a list?? I am very interested.
2021-05-24 04:57:11,wallstreetbets,The stocks that made this sub popular*
2021-05-23 23:47:46,wallstreetbets,"IMO, OP explained it terribly...

To oversimplify, the price of a call option is dictated by how likely an option is going to be above the strike price and by how much...

So the price of OP's option can go up simply by the market deciding that before January 2023 there has been an increase in the chance of GME exceeding $950 than the day OP bought the option.

--- 

And going back to your question, even though GME is at $176 today, the option expiry isnt for almost 2 more years... so that is plenty of time for anything crazy to happen. BUT as we approach the expiry date, then the option value will start to reflect what you stated... the difference between share price and strike price. And that is because with less time left, there is less likelihood for sudden price changes in GME."
2021-05-24 07:16:25,wallstreetbets,No
2021-05-23 23:41:29,wallstreetbets,"Also holding 2,000 shares.

Appreciate the advice, though."
2021-05-23 20:25:37,wallstreetbets,You are probably not wrong since some institution holders won't vote. But any vote numbers exceeding the current float will still be a huge boost and may trigger a new round of fomo since % of institution holders is well documented and all MSM has been saying all shorts have been covered.
2021-05-23 21:00:58,wallstreetbets,"Currently holding 2,000 shares.

And going to buy more with the money from these calls."
2021-05-23 21:33:35,wallstreetbets,"Is 2,000 shares enough for you?"
2021-05-23 23:26:31,wallstreetbets,Yep. And continuing my thesis: using the power of options to amass shares like crazy.
2021-05-23 23:47:16,wallstreetbets,"Weeklies are good for buying if you expect huge price movements. Weeklies are good for selling if you expect IV crush.

If you're expecting IV inflation, longer options with low IV at the point of entry may do better. Since theta and IV are separate factors, you get the theta boost on top of the IV spike.

At one point I believe these 950C were trading around $130/share (January/Feb), two years before expiration and with the stock trading under half of the strike.

I like to sell weeklies when IV is super high (holding shares to do so), and buy LEAPS when IV is low.

Just my 2cents."
2021-05-24 00:30:42,wallstreetbets,"I have 2,000 shares that beg to differ."
2021-05-24 00:32:29,wallstreetbets,Holding thousands of shares as well.
2021-05-24 00:27:47,wallstreetbets,If this is true
2021-05-24 01:26:02,wallstreetbets,"Go for it!

Report back and let us know how it goes."
2021-05-24 08:00:24,wallstreetbets,"Holding thousands of shares, too."
2021-05-24 12:51:54,wallstreetbets,"Haha, nope. Not that ballsy."
2021-05-24 13:37:11,wallstreetbets,Always has still been.

Many people who have done more recent research disagree."

2021-05-24 16:44:40,wallstreetbets,What’s with the downvotes?
2021-05-23 23:00:44,wallstreetbets,"If the next couple of weeks will be wild, then why did you waste so much money paying Jan 2023 premiums?? 😂

Makes absolutely no sense. Last Friday 180 calls for the near term were a fraction of the premiums you're paying...

Edit: they were 1/5 the premium you paid"
2021-05-24 00:14:03,wallstreetbets,2023. These will print.
2021-05-23 20:48:17,wallstreetbets,"If by ""wild ride"" you mean GME trending relatively flat and your calls taking a nose dive, then yes. If you mean anything other than that, then no."
2021-05-24 09:17:33,wallstreetbets,I sincerely hope these pay off for you! For some reason I get so happy anytime GME mints money for folks.
2021-05-24 09:30:31,wallstreetbets,Lol yes they will! Remind me
2021-05-24 10:53:51,wallstreetbets,Hey! Aren’t you that guy who wants to own GameStop? 😉
2021-05-24 12:04:13,wallstreetbets,A wild ride that will end in a fatal crash because you didn't make it over that chasm.
2021-05-24 13:57:31,wallstreetbets,This is so stupid. If you don’t understand options then shut up about them. Just hold your shares and stay quiet.
2021-05-24 13:44:50,wallstreetbets,Moo
2021-05-24 04:48:27,wallstreetbets,How do you find IV?
2021-05-24 13:11:03,wallstreetbets,"Yep, $950 leaps have been out since gme hit $400, same time the $800 weeklies came out"
2021-05-23 23:00:53,wallstreetbets,This is not uncertain.
2021-05-24 09:00:49,wallstreetbets,Now I understand the thought process that made you do this move
2021-05-24 01:39:02,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, that's a good point."
2021-05-24 00:36:07,wallstreetbets,"I expect GME to go up too, but why buy so far out and so high strike? Why not go lower and nearer for the same premium?"
2021-05-24 01:07:06,wallstreetbets,"assuming you’re selling to cash out on premium, do you have any worries you won’t be able to find another buyer?

2021-05-24 08:41:30,wallstreetbets,Yes they were. I picked them up for an average cost of $3.90 before the Feb 24th run up.
2021-05-24 01:39:04,wallstreetbets,Is it possible to have both at the same time? Asking for a friend..

2021-05-24 07:24:12,wallstreetbets,"If your strategy is to make profit to reinvest in GME, why not write calls on your 2,000 shares? I’ve been writing weeklies on my 100 shares since it popped from febs low and basically wiped out my entire basis"

2021-05-23 23:28:50,wallstreetbets,"Was considering picking this up when she was at 130, got called king of the Retards.. wish I would have just thrown that 15k on these leaps instead of tlry, I'd be up 100%"
2021-05-23 20:26:37,wallstreetbets,"I don't believe the buyer in your scenario will have voting rights until the shares are located **and** delivered.   The DTCC tracks every share and they are the ones that handle proxy voting, its not the brokers that do it based on client positions, the DTCC tells the brokerages who gets to vote.

That might make for an unhappy buyer (who can't vote) but that's the reality.   Every share is tracked, if the shares haven't been delivered from the short seller to the buyer then the buyer is not yet listed as registered shareholder and the DTCC will not send that buyer's broker a proxy to vote.    It is all based on the shareholders of record as of the date specified in the voting materials.

I guess we shall see, I suspect it will be a nothing-burger."
2021-05-24 00:35:49,wallstreetbets,all these guys are hating. ignore them. they wish they could do what you are doing
2021-05-24 03:16:51,wallstreetbets,Calls also have capped downside risk. GME could go back down to $20 if their ecommerce transformation fails. In that case you'd lose way more with shares vs a call option. OP's max loss is capped at the premium he paid.
2021-05-23 21:03:49,wallstreetbets,Nice
2021-05-23 21:41:56,wallstreetbets,In addition to your calls?  Cause thems calls you posted.  Not shares.
2021-05-23 23:27:37,wallstreetbets,I like the way you think. I shall watch your career with great interest.
2021-05-24 00:13:08,wallstreetbets,the write up you just gave me was brilliant and helped a lot but i just read your post on Owning GME and honestly don’t know what to think of you anymore
2021-05-24 00:34:14,wallstreetbets,Vote them then
2021-05-24 09:25:57,wallstreetbets,"If u have so many shares why bother buying calls? U can buy shares rn for a good price. U dont have to wait until ur call or whatever hits itm range. U simply only have to hold some shares n jerk off.

2021-05-24 12:50:10,wallstreetbets,"Tbh a longer date will give u better protection, much more ramping in price action on a short move and gme is a long play so take a long play

Take it from someone who doesn’t like to use condoms"
2021-05-24 09:17:07,wallstreetbets,You have to realize that these GME people have no idea what they are talking about regarding pretty much anything about the stock market.

2021-05-24 07:14:07,wallstreetbets,No it's not lmao
2021-05-24 00:39:12,wallstreetbets,"More time to do well, and higher theta multiplier added for when IV jumps."
2021-05-24 01:15:03,wallstreetbets,"I am not concerned about that, no.

Open interest is currently at around 1,500 for this strike at this date.

And that's with the current price suppression / stagnation.

I imagine a whole hell of a lot of people will want these once this thing starts picking up steam."

2021-05-23 22:47:49,wallstreetbets,Righttttt.....
2021-05-23 22:38:05,wallstreetbets,....or do they do that by realizing fat gains at the right time?
2021-05-24 09:26:01,wallstreetbets,"Totally agree. I’ve been thrown off course since joining WSB. Still holding some long term bets, but I could have made more in the short term had I stuck to my pre-wsb strategy.

If I succeed, take a breath and cool off from the trade. If I fail, try to figure out why I failed and how to be on the opposite side of that trade in the future.

Can sometimes find some really good DD on here, or follow suit behind someone making tendies (the trick in that is figuring out when to hop off!)"

Haven't been wrong, just been wierd I guess."

2021-05-24 00:56:07,wallstreetbets,This is absolutely the best way to play a potential GME squeeze. Problem is the dumdums don’t like to see it.
2021-05-24 00:49:01,wallstreetbets,If theta don’t fuck your first lmao 😂
2021-05-24 14:57:41,wallstreetbets,"as someone who thinks GME will have trouble ever breaking $200 again I feel like you just threw away $100k on some stupid shit.  

Hope for your sake that wasn't a true yolo and that you actually have money left over."
2021-05-24 05:39:52,wallstreetbets,He paid 2600$ per contract (he bought 36 of them). If he'd chosen a closer expiry he could've got at the money 180$ calls for about 500$ per contract.
2021-05-24 13:16:32,wallstreetbets,I decided to take profits. Exited with 118% profit since buying them on Friday morning.

2021-05-24 12:31:05,wallstreetbets,Currently up 130%. Bought on Friday.
2021-05-24 09:19:52,wallstreetbets,Have you actually read the GME DD? The data indicating naked shorting is undeniable and has been validated by leading experts about naked short selling.

2021-05-23 22:24:23,wallstreetbets,If they think it'll be flat why would they short?

2021-05-24 08:13:27,wallstreetbets,Can’t short a stock that’s moving sideways.  These “then short it” guys don’t know anything about how shorts work.
2021-05-24 09:18:20,wallstreetbets,Why would you short a stock you think is going to be flat? You people are seriously dumb as rocks.
2021-05-23 21:27:12,wallstreetbets,"I've tried the condor game, GME trades flat until you put one on."
2021-05-23 22:19:36,wallstreetbets,"Oct 15 or December calls are perfect. idk. anything longer than Jan 1 2022 seems like a waste, just buy way more for 2022, or December."
2021-05-24 01:20:10,wallstreetbets,"Wouldn't $500 calls be better? As the stock approaches $500, it's ITM. Then you let it run up to $895 (or before). Then buy $900 calls. This way you can buy more $900 calls because the ITM call is worth more, so there's more conversion. This either sounds genius, or more likely stupid/doesn't work. $900 calls would be better because if you truly think the stock is going to hit 2k-3k, then you'll make more with buying all $900 calls. 

Does this work, or am I too smooth brain here"
2021-05-23 22:20:03,wallstreetbets,You really shouldn’t need to explain this on WSB!

2021-05-23 22:48:11,wallstreetbets,"Well, I sure could have used an explanation or two like this back when I was mostly losing money on options!

Just trying to be the person I needed when I was younger."
2021-05-24 12:43:34,wallstreetbets,This is the alley way.
2021-05-24 16:20:19,wallstreetbets,nice you got me! thats a great pickup.
2021-05-24 01:33:08,wallstreetbets,"Not really, for companies that actually make money, stock ownership entitles you to a share of profits which the company provides through dividends and buybacks.

Of course, companies that make money is foreign territory for this sub nowadays so I understand why you don’t know that"

2021-05-23 21:22:04,wallstreetbets,Was going to be my next reply. It's like a Ponzi scheme it will gain as long as there is another huckleberry there with $1.5 times your investment. $900 call option wtf
2021-05-24 00:19:06,wallstreetbets,"If IV shoots up the bid will still be far higher than what he paid and a market maker will buy it from him. He will only lose on the bid ask spread which as I said, will still be way higher than it is today and this is the worst case scenario. There will be retards buying these."
2021-05-24 08:01:54,wallstreetbets,"And probably making a killing going thetagang and selling CCs.

A big part of me wonders if this is the reason DFV sporadically posts updates and is going silent for awhile. With 200,000 shares, he would be making a mint selling FDs. Even crazy low delta that will never be ITM is gonna bring in tons of cash on GME with that many shares

Edit- and he clearly plays options since he was long so many contracts. This is definitely speculation but I wouldn’t be surprised. It would be the smartest play here but people on the sub wouldn’t like it"
2021-05-24 10:17:01,wallstreetbets,I'll take a fifth of that action

2021-05-24 00:18:22,wallstreetbets,What? So you’re putting it in the same forecasted market cap as TSLA?? You’re on fucking glue.
2021-05-24 00:08:11,wallstreetbets,Lmao how old are you man
2021-05-24 00:44:03,wallstreetbets,Are you high? You realize there aren’t really any dedicated gaming retailers because it’s a dying business right? Anyone with an internet connection doesn’t need GameStop anymore. It’s why they try to push so many damn toys now. I game a lot and I’ve been there maybe twice in the past 6 years. One was because I left my controller at home 7 hours away when I went to visit my parents. The other was to return it 4 days later. The next PlayStation and Xbox probably won’t even have optical drives. They really didn’t need it with this generation.
2021-05-24 08:48:58,wallstreetbets,"all these people hating on you, dont let it get to you. this is the same crowd that i came to and tried to address gme at $4/a share and i got called a retard and europoor relentlessly."

2021-05-24 14:28:20,wallstreetbets,Yeah that's a good play. Jan 2023 just seems way further out then necessary though. Could get something with a decent time frame in say Nov 2021 with a much better strike price.

2021-05-24 04:15:17,wallstreetbets,"He's probably playing the IVs with this one. These call's premiums will increase with a jump of price of GME and then he'll be able to sell them at a profit. Sure, it might not be 100% but a 10-20% gain with his investment is solid.


I've done it a few times before when I bought some PUTs on GME and sold them the next day for a quick 10% gain


**Edit**

Sorry, you asked why Jan 23 was better than Oct 21. That's because of the expiry date giving these longer to play out. If nothing happens in the next year, he still has time for GME to hit his strike price or hopefully the IV on these helps him out and he can sell at a profit. I almost guarantee he won't be holding these in a month."
2021-05-23 23:17:45,wallstreetbets,"I understand what volatility is and especially with this had 250 C early on with like 480 volatility the point I’m making is now wouldn’t you want your IV to explode now… would “guarantee” a large increase or decrease but in this case the former.. in stock price over 100% like with my 250calls   So

You want to know why everyone around GME is burning down? Well... DFV told everyone over a year ago. 

I'm not a dick rider but I mean... He executed at $12 and could've been fine with 150,000 shares. Instead he chose to spend $7.5m more to buy at $155 and that alone is confirmation bias enough for many."

With an option this far out your bigger concerns are Vega and Rho, and even then theta still manages to retain most of the value."
2021-05-24 10:48:05,wallstreetbets,"So if it goes to 950 a share, he can sell at any time, or do you have to wait until the expiry date to exercise the options?"

2021-05-23 23:25:32,wallstreetbets,"Yes, it is an ideal strategy to be holding options *before* volatility skyrockets.

Been holding shares, selling calls, and buying more shares with the money since February (while IV slid down from 1,000%+ to now sub-100%).

Now I'm long on calls again, since the premiums are getting so very affordable. Still intend to pour my earnings from this play into more shares, too."
2021-05-23 20:50:40,wallstreetbets,I mostly trade options in my taxable account because I'd rather be able to take losses on more speculative investments
2021-05-24 02:21:42,wallstreetbets,Well I do be stupid
2021-05-23 20:50:55,wallstreetbets,"Sure thing- open interest is the amount of contracts bought/sold. So for OPs strike price and date there have been almost 1500 bought/sold. Open interest is tracked. If you look at the options chain (depending on your broker) you should be able to see it or adjust your settings to see it. I use TD Ameritrade 

As far as the bid/ask spread. For 1/23 950 call highest bid is 23.45 and lowest ask is 28.30 (these are prices from market close Friday so obviously that will change at market open tomorrow and during regular trading hours it is constantly moving)

So. Say you buy a contract, lowest ask is 28.30 so it will cost you $2,830 for a contract, BUT since the highest bid is only $23.45 it’s already $485 in the hole (if you wanted to sell right away) 28.30-23.45= 4.85 x 100 shares per contract is $485.

Now that’s extremes for bid/ask. Obviously if you put in a limit sell order and your offer is the lowest ask, it will be sold above the highest bid price. So usually with selling you can get a price somewhere in the middle. But, increases in IV or stock price is going to make the value of the option go up which is what OP will need to get his option back in the green because right after buying the option it is automatically worth less than he payed"

2021-05-24 02:02:15,wallstreetbets,Just curious but where did that money come from?
2021-05-24 02:17:13,wallstreetbets,"There’s a massive difference between DFV and this guy and to pretend there’s not is foolish as fuck.

The difference was that DFV found that GME was shorted by more than the stock that even exists. He didn’t try to time it. He just pointed that at one point they’ll need to buy it back.

This guy is trying to time that by NOTHING BASED ON LOGIC. I doubt you realize how stupid that is because Ive needed to write this explaining it."

2021-05-24 01:18:34,wallstreetbets,"You guys are dumb. I’m not saying GameStop will fail. I’m saying you’re being far too optimistic because the industry doesn’t need brick and mortar nearly as much anymore. This whole sub has become this way. GME hasn’t been that profitable of a company for quite some time. I was a manager there over a decade ago and they were already shutting down stores. They don’t care if you buy consoles. Sony doesn’t even make money off consoles. GameStop relies heavily on used games. All the toys and T-shirt’s can be bought at hot topic, Barnes and noble, or tons of other places. They hate PC gaming. They don’t want to deal with those products. They only started selling parts because it’s a last resort to stay relevant. GameStop will not be growing. They won’t go out of business but they are not some bullish company that you think they are. Are you guys even focusing on financial reports? Have you even looked at them. I highly doubt it seeing the comparison you made to iPhones lol."
2021-05-24 08:11:09,wallstreetbets,Lmao yeah I totally buy all that stuff from GameStop.

>The difference was that DFV found that GME was shorted by more than the stock that even exists. He didn’t try to time it. He just pointed that at one point they’ll need to buy it back.

And he's still right and still thinks that which is why he bought at $155 because he thought even at $155 it was a good buy... Just like $4 and $40.

2021-05-23 21:45:11,wallstreetbets,"You do realize that if IV doubles or triples his option will be profitable right? Like the stock could completely collapse and come back to just over 100 and this option could still be profitable. This is not a “stock going up $100” play. Option prices can change simply from VIX. Do some research man.

Edit- OP said IV was under 100, that’s why he bought. Do you know how possible it is for GME IV to go back over 200? Very possible. Especially considering the whole market has been a roller coaster the last few weeks"

2021-05-24 07:43:28,wallstreetbets,The GME cult is delusional that will leave many teenagers out of their pocket money.
2021-05-24 12:36:52,wallstreetbets,"You’re listening to my comments and not reading them? Also I’m not delusional. I said the industry is a dying which is true. It doesn’t mean game stop will crash and burn but they won’t be growing. They rely heavily on used games. That’s where most of their profit comes from. I assure you I worked there for 4 years. I was a manager for 2 1/2. They constantly push you to sell used everything over new because the new products don’t make much money.  It’s just common sense that as video games move further away from using disks then their profit begins to shrink. It’s why over the past 10 years every time you go in there they have more and more stuff cluttering the store like clothes, toys, and now pc parts that they don’t even have room for because their stores are too small. They are looking for new ways to survive and compete. The problem is they end up in a weird place where they have problems competing. Clothing and toys people don’t go there just for that. They go to other places that specialize in that stuff. They just have customers buying it when they come in for games which will shrink over time. 

It’s easy to look at OP or the other people trashing what I’m sayings posts and realize they are almost all GME related. Ever since the squeeze there has been this cult like following of people who quite honestly don’t seem to even understand why or how that happened. They don’t understand fundamentals of trading or investing. They just have this dream of GameStop being 1000+ a share. It’s all rockets and diamond hands. It’s just not realistic."
2021-05-24 13:25:52,wallstreetbets,"Yes. I’ve been saying GameStop’s best bet is to heavily rely on e-commerce. I’ve been saying that for years. The problem is it still doesn’t change the direction that gaming is going. It still doesn’t change their biggest profits come from used gaming which will be diminished in the next 5-10 years. They will just be like newegg, bestbuy, or dozens of other companies just like those. Chewy was a very specialized business. Especially at it’s time of creation. GameStop will have a hard time ever growing like that. It’s not the same type of industry because technology changes it so much where pet products will always be needed and aren’t going to change."
2021-05-24 01:41:51,wallstreetbets,I understand. I’m asking what price do you think it would reach and I also want to know what price do you think it’s actually worth. I think you’re wrong if you think it’s undervalued. I’d say it’s overvalued right now. You loving the company and believing in it doesn’t mean it’s undervalued.

No one is predicting both. Why do you think they are? ""the future"" is pretty open ended. I see no dates do you? If you think sometime in the future AAPL will be worth $10T youre probably right and thats fine to say yea?  

>I’d bet this so and so digital currency will eventually hit 1m. Am I going to try to estimate WHEN? No. Because NOW we’re gambling.

Everything you invest in is a gamble...you are buying a share today hoping tomorrow it will be worth more based on things outside of your control.

Its all a gamble lmao wtf?

I didnt oversimplify it. You asked what would one use. And i gave two solutions. I understand VLOOKUP is not an elegant solution as it searches right to left or left to right. Im sure its right to left lol.

The two solutions provided. Either using a VM db setup, cleaner, shareable. And allows anyone to access it anywhere vs using the array formula from within excel itself was a pretty simple IMO and far better than VLOOKUP. was just trying to help. You see what i did there? Help.

Also VLOOKUP only looks to the right, it doesn't search anything other than the left most column. As in, vertically looking up a value (up and down), and then returning specified column to the right 

That's like the fundamental part of VLOOKUP, it's a vertical search, not left to right or right to left.

2021-05-24 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Market Review: A look at recent trends, performance, and some assumptions on where we go from here Recently I've been trying to put some my thoughts down in writing, instead of just living in my head, as a way to fully think through what's rolling around in my head as I look at charts, read articles, listen to podcasts, etc.  

I attempt here to provide some market context through charts and some conjecture based on the aforementioned media I've consumed lately.
&nbsp;


##Let’s start with a look at overall market performance by sector

I like to use this to establish a point of reference - _what_ kinds of stocks are actually doing well and which are doing poorly?

[Sector Performance, 1y](https://imgur.com/cV2n4du)

[Sector Performance,  2021 YTD](https://imgur.com/LrgETAx)

I’m using ARKK here as a proxy for high-growth, unprofitable companies since that’s a lot of what they own.  
Some notes:  

- Tech, and in particular, unprofitable tech, has underperformed YTD since about mid-Feb.
- Financials, Industrials, and Energy have out-performed and this is very clear on the YTD chart.  

This reflation trade started in about mid-February and is what has been leading these indices higher while last year’s growth trade has lagged and given back.

##Now let’s look at index performance:

[SPY 1y](https://imgur.com/eaDWp9s)

[QQQ 1y](https://imgur.com/iGGKKee)

[IWM 1y](https://imgur.com/57uD3Ue)

I've tried to highlight ranges, pullbacks, and bounces in these.   
**Take-Aways**  

- Last week saw another test of our recent lows and again a bounce, seemingly fueled by panic-buying at the Thursday open.  
- The 21DMA is possibly acting as a level of resistance on these bounces; for SPY the 50DMA has held, QQQ support at 316.  
- Despite the recent volatility, we have no had a significant drawdown; we're still close to ATHs on these indices, and specifically I look at QQQ's chart and this pullback has not been as significant as our previous ones over the last year.
- IWM appears to have formed a range, which I’d say was really established after the pullback towards the end of March. This is possibly due to the divergence between small cap growth and value (shown below) that started around this time. This chart is something to watch - if this breaks out in either direction it could pick up momentum and run. 

[Small Cap Growth vs Small Cap Value, Selected ETFs 1y](https://imgur.com/kkdbTmk)

Comparing two of the most popular small cap growth ETFs against two of the most popular small cap value ETFs showcases the recent outperformance of the value trade in place of the growth trade which did so well post-crash. 

**Conjecture**  

- You can spin two perspectives from the recent chop: we’ve held some established support and bounced nicely so hard to see us really breaking down further, alternatively we’ve tested downside support two times in quick succession without pushing to previous ATHs in between, which could be a sign of weakening  and indication of possible further downside.
- Equities markets have seemingly shrugged off the recent volatility in digital asset markets. With the growing proliferation of the latter, we have to consider what impact and correlation it can have on/with equities (or other) markets. If a bubble is bursting here, does it signal a growing risk-off mentality that could expand pervasively to equities markets as well? 


##Shaping a Narrative into the End of the Year

I'm just gonna throw down some talking points here based on the charts above, market sentiment, and some stuff I've been reading; this is what I have in mind _right now_, but all of this can change in an instant of course: 

**Summer -** expecting the reflation trade (financials, energy, industrials, value) to lead any upward move while growth and tech underperform.

**June FOMC -** There is speculation that we could see the Fed firm up tapering talk starting here… or possibly later in August at the Jackson Hole meeting.

**August Jackson Hole Meetup -** If we haven’t heard anything regarding tapering prior, speculation will be high that this is when the Fed will announce policy change, as that’s what happened last year with inflation targeting. With fear of a taper tantrum, we might see market shifts due to hedging leading up to this.

**Late Summer -** If we haven’t had one by now, I’d expect a meaningful (10%) pullback. 

**Inflation Data -** June will most likely be another high print due to base effects and the current supply chain woes, but if we continue to get high prints into July, August, and later this year, inflation will become a real issue.

**Fall -** We start to get murky here. I’d look for a late-year rally to follow any pullback, but it’s hard to say; too many unknowns. 

**EOY Targets -** CNBC’s median analyst target is 4300 with the low being 3800. Consider we’re already +11%, +%12, +4% YTD on SPY, IWM, and QQQ respectively, and +86%, +119%, +92% since the March 2020 lows, is it not reasonable to ask just how much higher can we go in the near-term?

**Considerations**
- Value over growth is still the trend and looks to remain that way - the ""reflation trade"" is the trend and no reason to fight it.
- Consider seasonality. We’re entering a time period where historically we often see sideways movement or some downside until the fall. It’s something to consider when positioning and planning time horizon on short-term trades going forward.
- Have long exposure, but be careful with positioning and time horizons. I have to echo the same sentiment that many others have: you can have a bearish view on this market given all of the bullshit, but there is no way you can't be long right now. Stay with the trend.
&nbsp;

I think right now if you’re long you need to be long banks, industrials, energy, SPY. I would stay away from growth and tech - until we see these push ATHs e.g. IWM, QQQ break out of their ranges to the upside, stay out or short them. 

## Bonus Charts

**Commodities Performance**

I thought it would be interesting to look at the recent performance of certain commodities in comparison with major indices:

[Select Commodities vs Select Indices, 1y](https://imgur.com/fRAUEyt)

[Select Commodities ETFs vs Select Indices, 1y](https://imgur.com/jH48XtQ)

Lumber’s performance slightly skews the first chart, but in both we can see well enough that a divergence starting to occur in early-mid April - something to continue to watch as it’s a correlation with the inflation narrative but more specifically the supply chain issues we’ve had. 

**Comparing Recent and (Recently) Historical Index Performance**

When considering the EOY Target data and the recent performance of equities, I thought it would be interesting to scale back a little further and do some historical comparisons:

[SPY 5y](https://imgur.com/NL0qgBn)

[QQQ 5y](https://imgur.com/aMIv0Xc)

[IWM 5y](https://imgur.com/LhEheTy)

From a low of 198.65 on 28 Jun 2016 to the pre-covid high of 338.12 on 10 Feb 2020, the SPY went up ~70%.  
We can look at the yearly breakdown:  

[SPY, Yearly % Returns](https://imgur.com/mSTSsLh) ([source](https://www.macrotrends.net/2526/sp-500-historical-annual-returns))  

AS mentioned, in 2021 we’re up ~11% already; from the pre-covid highs just over a year ago the SPY is up 25%. Bonkers."
2021-05-24 17:49:41,wallstreetbets,All these down votes and by the end of the week you’ll have been right 😂
2021-05-23 20:11:10,wallstreetbets,"Well, yes that is correct - about %26 of the current holdings are classified as _Information Technology_ and some of the top holdings include AAPL, FB, MSFT, AMZN. These are technology companies, but they are _profitable_, large cap tech companies, and SPY itself is also composed of a diversified set of large cap companies.   
Alternatively, QQQ is more targeted towards growth (which recently has been technology) and in addition to containing more _unprofitable_ ""growth"" companies, has a larger % allocated to these companies, and is less diversified.  
ARKK is a more extreme example of QQQ; this might help explain why the SPY has been holding up well relative to the other indices, and is capable of pushing towards ATHs again even if the tech trade flounders."
2021-05-23 21:22:03,wallstreetbets,"Spy has Tesla which now has larger trading volume, so weakness on Tesla will drive spy down. So far spy has cycle out of Tesla as best as it can but if Tesla does get more selling pressure probably will drag spy down and turn the market."
2021-05-23 21:40:47,wallstreetbets,"Well, I kinda look at it like this: TSLA's weight in the S&P 500 is only ~1.3% ([source](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/institutional/etfs/funds/spdr-sp-500-etf-trust-spy)), and given that I'd hesitate to suggest that TSLA could pull the SPY down meaningfully.  
Now, could a downslide in TSLA be just one indication of a greater risk-off mentality and market downturn? Sure, but I'm not sure that TSLA going down another %10 is, _by itself_, going to drive SPY lower by a considerable amount. IMO we might be talking a few bps here, not another leg lower; I'll say I could be wrong and just misunderstanding the potential impacts here of course"
2021-05-23 21:47:17,wallstreetbets,"We will see I’m looking at TLT and the 10y bond yield as an indicator now. I’m not going long or short until I see some signs. 

I’m shocked market recovered so fast but that’s a given, with the fed still doing massive repo which is crazy. 

Clearly, the fed has to take the repo off or taxpayers going to be losing trillions when market sinks (of course they can’t sell either cause market will sink). 

I’ll be eyeing consumer confidence and spending in next few months as I see inflation taking bite (consumer spending has slowed yet because of the covid lockdown but that’s coming to an end soon)."

If the price moves more than the expected, any IV crush should be outweighed by the increased value of the option. If the change is less than the expected move, you're generally crushed."

And which banks have the best ratios and most cash?  That's right, Canadian banks.  There are five big ones and they all look *crazy* undervalued.  Absolute bargain prices, real steals.

How could a big bet on Canadian banks possibly go wrong?  I mean, the only way it could go tits up is if a bunch of the assets they have on their books turned out to be toxic garbage.  But that's impossible.  There would have to be a massive real estate bubble or something to make that happen.

2021-05-23 22:12:37,wallstreetbets,Weekly/monthly Csps give you some wiggle room on timing the bottom. If you sell an at the money put while it's on the way down you'll have a lower cost basis than if you bought stock  at the same moment you sold the put. Ie you sell a 6 dollar strike price put for 0.30 premium you're actually buying the stock for 5.70 vs buying it at the 5.80-6.00 that it's trading at the time of selling your put. Now obviously it can tank further before the expiration but you weren't planning on waiting that long to begin with so you'd be holding the bag either way. And if it went up instead? Well you still get to pocket your 30 cents per share so if it only went up to 6.20 you actually ended up ahead without even having to own the stock.
2021-05-23 23:16:23,wallstreetbets,Correct. And just like most instruments there’s a time and place for each but selling puts as a primary strategy won’t yield you the highest return.

So if he said Tesla didn't sell coin but Tesla did, that would misled investors calculating tesla assets in coins.  Doesn't matter if coin is a stock.

2021-05-24 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"New cancer drug on the Horizon - Anktiva from ImmunityBio IBRX  

It's rather shocking to me that most people have never heard of ImmunityBio - IBRX in the biotech space.  They have this new drug called Anktiva could be a new cancer drug for a wide range of cancers. Not just one type but looks to be for mutliple types of cancers based on the study.  Seems like the side-effects are minimal.  Only downside I see from the study is that it's only a phase 2 trial of 140 patients so it's not as wide-ranging as a phase 3 study.  Although, Anktiva got a 71% complete response rate (early remission) for bladder cancer patients in another phase 3 study.  So FDA approval could be on the horizon since a phase 3 was done for bladder cancer. 

But apparently according to the phase 2 study, Anktiva also helps keep other cancers in check too. . Anktiva got a 68% durable disease control in a study for various cancers where patients failed previous checkpoint therapies (like Keytruda).  Could be hope for those who have failed previous treatments for various solid tumors.   If you know of anyone that has cancer and has failed or is failing treatment(s), I would call up IBRX and try to get in a study.

Best outcome I see with AMC stock is a return to the price levels before the pandemic.  Due to the high float on the stock, I don't see it reaching GME price levels.

While encouraging, it doesn't overwhelm as there are other bigger biotechs such as FATE that are getting high numbers for complete responses (CR's) in liquid tumors from their trials.  Nowadays in the competitive field, you have to get high CR's in liquid cancer trials to be competitive.  Imo, liquid cancers are easier to treat than solid tumors due to solid tumors being a mass of cells in a specific area whereas liquid cancers are systemic and free flowing in blood.  IBRX had like 78% CR rate in a trial for indolant non-hodgkin lymphoma with Anktiva and Rituxan.  Most cancer treatments now are going by way of combo therapy."

2021-05-23 23:28:08,wallstreetbets,Thank you. Someone who sees through Elon’s tweets.
2021-05-24 15:42:44,wallstreetbets,Ha wanna hear something even more funny…OP said he’s aiming for $450 lol
2021-05-23 22:07:20,wallstreetbets,his strike is 550?
2021-05-23 23:22:38,wallstreetbets,Unless Elon gives us another split!
2021-05-24 07:43:32,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, it will pass 450, and plumit at 420, all the way down to a (Still incredibly optimistic valuation based on the fundamentals, assuming massive yearly growth) $56 / share.  


If we were to put a value on Tesla based on the pure fundementals, assuming a normal P/E ratio of 25, Tesla would be valued at $17.50. We can agree Tesla is a cool company building cool stuff while still using our fucking brains and seeing how overvalued the shares are."
2021-05-23 20:20:23,wallstreetbets,If it dips below 500 op is gonna bank on these puts as long as he's not greedy

2021-05-23 21:13:45,wallstreetbets,Priced in.
2021-05-24 01:12:40,wallstreetbets,You need to look up a video on options for beginners my friend. He bought puts which means he is banking on the fact that the price per share of TSLA will go down. It doesn’t have to go to $450 but the lower the price goes the more his put will be worth. If he were to exercise his put option he would be required to sell 100 shares of TSLA at $550 regardless of the price per share. If he does nothing before the expiration date the option will expire worthless and he will lose his entire investment.
2021-05-23 21:12:43,wallstreetbets,The stock price goes down my account goes up. Stock price goes up my account goes boom. Simple

2021-05-23 20:54:55,wallstreetbets,I was short TSLA before Michael Burry’s Q1 position announcement. [here’s proof](https://twitter.com/prftrocket/status/1392208949517115392?s=21) I called the play on my Twitter.
2021-05-24 17:30:34,wallstreetbets,"I’m just getting online to mod, so didn’t see - was it as a new post? If so it will need to be sold and posted as a gain/loss, otherwise another yolo update would have to wait a month."
2021-05-23 23:55:56,wallstreetbets,Share price dropping isn't inherently a failure of the company.
2021-05-24 00:43:39,wallstreetbets,"I don't think anyone is betting on tesla failing, just betting on the valuation not being as absurd."
2021-05-24 07:40:15,wallstreetbets,"If we assume that Tesla gains a 90% share of the auto market, it would still be overvalued. That's what the cultists don't realise, Tesla doesn't need to ""fail"" to be overvalued. We're not betting that it goes bankrupt, we're not even betting that it stagnates, we're betting that the hype dies down and it gets an overly optimistic valuation at a P/E ratio of say, 100, that would price the shares around $220.  


All that said, their carbon-credit sales are drying up, there's a lot of things stacking up against Tesla now. I can still acknowledge that I want to buy myself a nice car, even if I think the company selling that car is going to hit a wall soon."
2021-05-23 23:15:33,wallstreetbets,haha I did it with NIO :)
2021-05-24 11:39:46,wallstreetbets,The company is still overvalued under the inflation and interest hike risks we are facing. I think it’s a smart move the multiple is crazy and the cars are dope

2021-05-23 23:29:38,wallstreetbets,"To be clear, he's not shorting Tesla because he thinks the company sucks. He's shorting it because he thinks the economy sucks and Tesla has too many short term paper handed kids.

He's betting on runaway inflation affecting everyone."

2021-05-24 01:17:11,wallstreetbets,No he thinks tesla is overvalued as hell not a bad company but when apple trades at 30 p/e an tesla trades at 580 p/e its kinda hard to not short it
2021-05-24 07:41:41,wallstreetbets,"He's shorting it because he thinks the share price is absurdly high. ""Paper hands"" as you put it, would be the rational actors in his scenario."

2021-05-23 23:41:02,wallstreetbets,"True, however I think even true Teslaheads are seeing the writing on the wall, take profit now or hang on as the stock market goes through this “ correction”. I bet some soon to be liquidated groups own a lot of Tesla, would explain DR. Burry’s play"

2021-05-23 23:21:52,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-05-24 09:07:01,wallstreetbets,"Tesla are not in the energy business, DD over.

Their energy products, solar panels and utilities are actually sold at a loss. They sell them at a loss because it makes their main product, the car, a more attractive purchase.

They don't actually fully manufacture solar panels by the way, they simply assemble them. They ""make solar panels"" the same way gamers ""make a computer"". They're more of a solar panel reseller than manufacturer.

As for batteries, they're still very reliant on upstream suppliers. And they're not the only people in the world working on battery tech. It looks like they have an edge due to the range on their cars compared with competitors, but that's actually an issue of price-to-utility ratio, competitors aren't selling longer-range cars because consumers don't seem to care much about range past the 200km mark.

tl;dr: There is no ""Tesla energy business"", they're just reselling energy products at a loss to boost car sales and generate carbon credits."
2021-05-24 11:19:11,wallstreetbets,True he even tweeted to elon musk saying he should sell some stock at these absurd valuations back when it was 800
2021-05-24 01:16:28,wallstreetbets,"Look you may be right but if 100 people try to time the market, 10 will get it right by chance and think they’re investing geniuses"
2021-05-24 00:15:26,wallstreetbets,Bro Tesla even at the current price is expecting absolute perfection. They are so overvalued regardless of what their all time high is. 450 is 2250 for Tesla pre split. Think about that for a second. They were 200 in 2019.
2021-05-23 20:18:14,wallstreetbets,This is what I would bet on given how he played gme
2021-05-24 07:47:30,wallstreetbets,"If you think that's true, you're retarded. Building fabs requires multi-billion dollar investments, and several years of construction.

Anyone who takes that rumour seriously is genuinely retarded, even if Tesla announced it today."
2021-05-24 00:28:00,wallstreetbets,"This is definitely the right way to think about this. Not the bankruptcy part- Tesla has a market share that will never be taken from Elon’s ape like dead hands, but now that VW, Ford, Mercedes, and Toyota have awoken to the market need, they’re gonna absolutely tear Tesla apart with the small details of car ownership- dealer networks, cost of repairs, diversity of offerings, and probably price point (eventually).

We’re only seeing their second passes at figuring EV’s out, the third and fourth generations will probably surpass Tesla."

2. hold for  a move to \~$23. the chart looks like it could go there and the week before a US holiday is usually bullish.
3. Sell all and take the profit.  While the chart looks bullish, it has found some resistance here and could tank.  Also you don't have all that much time left and are not actually ITM yet.  50% profit at this stage is good, don't lose money on this trade.

But since this is WSB the answer is clearly 'sell and buy even more OTM calls with both the initial capital and the profits - repeat until you are broke.'"

2021-05-23 22:14:41,wallstreetbets,The only thing that sucks is someone has to buy them. And it looks like there’s not many people wanting it.
2021-05-23 22:15:26,wallstreetbets,I’d say sell enough *contracts to fully exercise a few of those contracts and then sell the underlying stock you buy immediately
2021-05-23 22:33:42,wallstreetbets,Buy the rumor sell the news
2021-05-23 22:36:49,wallstreetbets,Sold may hold for a day or 2 may be some good catalysts to spring them gains up a cpl hundred this week

2021-05-23 23:13:10,wallstreetbets,"I would sell up to 75% and let the others ride free. Stay with 20 contracts. If it starts to go against you secure remaining profits. If it still trends up you can sell 5 at a time and scale out. Not a financial advisor, just what I would do if it was me🤷🏻‍♂️"

2021-05-23 23:36:19,wallstreetbets,"I’m going to be laughing when you still hold and lose it all. Remember that time is more valuable than the actual stock. Sell soon, also doesn’t help that the market is at a very scary state"

Treat trading as a business.. There is no honor in holding your positions like an idiot until you go broke.. MAKE MONEY ON YOUR POSITION AND SELL FOR PROFIT.."

2021-05-24 14:46:07,wallstreetbets,if he didn't sell he would've got x4 gains
2021-05-24 16:44:34,wallstreetbets,"Sell it. I held on to BB calls wayy too long thinking I would see a pop at some point that never came. Had calls that were like +1000% and now I'm -50% (because I am an idiot, obviously). No regrets, take the money."
2021-05-23 21:40:15,wallstreetbets,A lesson we all learn after a few times of watching gains disappear 🥲
2021-05-23 23:19:17,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-05-24 02:08:16,wallstreetbets,I wish I'd actually done this with my GME options on the first squeeze. Feels bad man
2021-05-23 22:55:55,wallstreetbets,"This is a Roulette table, Sir.  Good play!"
2021-05-24 08:57:38,wallstreetbets,"Hey bro, time to cash in first thing this morning! Congrats to you on your trade. Sell ASAP and enjoy your awesome profits!"

2021-05-24 08:35:19,wallstreetbets,Keep your finger on that market sell tho could fade at open. Best of luck!

2021-05-24 00:24:41,wallstreetbets,"Aint this the fuckin truth. My first was gme in march when i bought for 1k, watched it climb to 7k but held like a dumbass and watched it all disappear in 30 mins. Take it and run op."
2021-05-23 23:01:13,wallstreetbets,I’d sell enough to cover my investment as well as sell half the remaining to take profits.  Let 1/4 ride for the high.
2021-05-23 23:28:17,wallstreetbets,"This is the thing that tears me up...

I've had multiple 2x, 3x, 5x+ returns on my picks...

I sat on a 20x on BB and a 75x on GME...

I had no perspective at the time. It's sort of surreal and almost cruel to learn that a ""mere"" 100% return is supposedly incredibly rare and fortunate when in the span of a few months after starting trading options I had half a dozen 200%+ gains and I just threw many of them away.

I often wonder if I was just incredibly lucky/stupid and if I'll ever see those kinds of returns again, or if it was all just a fluke."
2021-05-24 00:17:17,wallstreetbets,I do it every week with spy. I also go out and lose most of it the following week so im only down about 20k
2021-05-24 17:18:40,wallstreetbets,Won't matter nearly as much since they're ITM.
2021-05-23 22:19:15,wallstreetbets,Its 99.19 sir
2021-05-24 11:48:45,wallstreetbets,"I’m with you there, really wonder if I just got lucky or I’m just retarded or both. I had a number of 2x, 3xand 4x returns in 2020, and a couple 10x and 20x returns that I closed on. But I probably had an equal number or more slip away out of greed, that I assumed would just go higher.

My initial GME returns in January were as high 42x. I ended up selling at 28x, and bought back in at $46, so sitting around 4x again."
2021-05-23 21:53:06,wallstreetbets,"Huh? Nah they're trivial. They're almost as easy as RH.

It takes a little longer (like a couple of days) for them to process it but other than that it's totally easy."
2021-05-24 00:13:33,wallstreetbets,ok stupid

I started off swapping around the different books for promos in the beginning as well and it actually made me realize how shitty the UI is on every book except FanDuel and DK. I think we see consolidation in the sector as books realize they can’t win over customers long term with shitty $10 promos and a terrible app.  
  
For reference I’ve used Pointsbet, Wynn, TwinSpires, FanDuel, DK, fox bet, Golden Nugget, MGM, William Hill, and 888 Sportsbook"

2021-05-24 00:21:08,wallstreetbets,How'd you get to that?
2021-05-24 08:44:46,wallstreetbets,PENN owns too many Casinos. DKNG is a pure play on online sports betting.
2021-05-24 12:21:15,wallstreetbets,"Closed some at ~47.15, will be closing more at ~48.99 if we get there today. Up huge rn"
2021-05-23 21:07:29,wallstreetbets,"Buying MGM to gain exposure to legalized online  gambling is like buying Nissan in 2012 to gain exposure to electric vehicles....yeah they had the Leaf but Tesla’s singular focus is electric vehicles.  The online gambling market isn’t about getting all of the current gamblers.  It’s about turning those unlikely to step foot in a casino into part time gamblers from the comfort of their home.  Whoever has the best tech will provide the best long-term value.  Think Facebook, DoorDash, Amazon or Twitter....those companies changed our habits by being great at building something easy, enjoyable and infused with AI so it knows what you want to do before you know what you want to do.  That’s the bet here.  If you want to pretend you’re exposed to online gambling you can convince yourself MGM , PENN and WYNN are the plays but what you’re really doing is fooling yourself because you don’t like the risk that comes with something new and unprofitable like DKNG.  The only thing that makes me pause is the price to sales ratio of DKNG.  BUT if the short-term premium for no debt is 20x-35x then pay attention to forward revenue and buy the fucking dips kids.  And if you feel like not putting all your eggs in one basket then get yourself some FanDuel when they launch."

2021-05-24 07:57:15,wallstreetbets,"I d/l’ed the MGM app to see if it would pull me as a user.  What I found was the exact same app format as William Hill, Barstool, FoxBet & FanDuel with a different skin.  They do have one of the better sign up bonuses and hired Jaimie Fox as their mascot but their app is cumbersome and basic. As a gambler I’d use them for the sign up bonus and uninstall after that.  Everyone does have the right to their own DD and I always put my money on the people with the best code for the job, and that is clearly DKNG."

2021-05-24 08:30:16,wallstreetbets,Fuck your puts
2021-05-24 09:07:18,wallstreetbets,This trade is not aging well.
2021-05-24 09:22:17,wallstreetbets,"I write puts against SPY all the time at $360-$380. Make lots of money. 

I read this quickly, and was like “why wish you luck? These will easily expire worthless and you’ll make a fat premiu——oh, you’re long? Shit. Good luck homie. Gotta go.”"
2021-05-24 09:32:30,wallstreetbets,"Ouch. Currently at $1.93, down 51%, or $186,000."

2021-05-24 11:12:54,wallstreetbets,Omg bro. SPY is at $419.20 as of 11:12am Monday.. you’re fucked
2021-05-23 20:08:12,wallstreetbets,I think this is a pretty good bet. Most likely SPY is gonna fall down or trade sideways. Looks like it was just propped up by the big funds while liquidating other stocks. I would probably choose a longer expiration though.
2021-05-23 20:30:13,wallstreetbets,My 5/28 $415 calls wish you the worst of luck..
2021-05-23 21:31:18,wallstreetbets,Futures not looking good for you

2021-05-23 22:22:26,wallstreetbets,"As long as you’re not in a rush to cash in, there is nothing to worry about.

2021-05-23 23:04:19,wallstreetbets,I don't care if I have a zillion dollars. Holding 360k options through the weekend is way to much for my anxiety tolerance
2021-05-24 00:05:29,wallstreetbets,"Holding SPY puts on one of the more bullish weeks of the year.  Seems like a good WSB strategy.  Better hope we drop early in the week.  


'Position type = Long'  is that long the market or long puts?  I assume you bought puts.  


If we do drop get out with a smaller loss.  No way those are ITM by Friday (he says with the confidence of a retard that knows how to lose money)"

2021-05-24 13:02:42,wallstreetbets,Next time Sell some deep OTM puts (for example Put 400 or  Put 405) so your possible loss would be smaller. Also the profit would be smaller as well but it's a good strategy if you don't expect it to fall below a certain level
2021-05-24 13:15:29,wallstreetbets,OP ARE YOU OKAY MY BRUDA

2021-05-23 23:49:21,wallstreetbets,He bought puts though.
2021-05-23 23:48:37,wallstreetbets,Because this is fake.

2021-05-24 01:43:16,wallstreetbets,I too own Upstart puts.  What’s your position on those? You been playing it on its previous run ups?
2021-05-24 16:21:40,wallstreetbets,Ouchies... Hopefully he gives up an update on his planned strategy
2021-05-24 10:53:49,wallstreetbets,"If you are non-margin, you’d need $36k for a $360 put. 

If you do it on margin like a true 🌈🐻 looking for 💎💎💎🚀🚀🚀🔥🔥🔥 then all I can say is my broker requires between $5,800 and $8,500 per contact in cash collateral. 

(Right now I have four SPY puts open that I wrote, with $360-$390 strike prices, June/July expirations, and $1,300 of premiums. There’s a $28,345 margin requirement for these. On that $28,345 that I need to have sit in cash, this translates to an approximate 27% annual return. If S&P falls below that and I get exercised, I can afford to buy more SPY (I have plenty of cash to cover things if needed) and would actually be happy to get some SPY at 360, so I’m good either way.)"
2021-05-23 21:42:32,wallstreetbets,Thanks! Still hope to see green on our investment!
2021-05-24 14:28:53,wallstreetbets,Everything on this sub is suspicious.

2021-05-23 21:00:35,wallstreetbets,Not a gay bear here. Just to wish someone with a huge position on weeklies the best of luck
2021-05-24 10:20:32,wallstreetbets,So far pretty good dude
2021-05-24 14:38:38,wallstreetbets,🤡
2021-05-24 14:08:49,wallstreetbets,Theta doesn't kill you as fast and higher probability of success.
2021-05-24 15:52:32,wallstreetbets,"If I hope spy to find support lets say @ 405, I sell these puts and also collect these premiums so my profit is even bigger. If I am wrong and it keeps rising, I lose less. If it falls below 405 I make fixed profit which consist of buy Put 415 to 405 + premiums sold @ 405. It depends on your strategy. 

Usually I use it when I want to bet on earnings (or volatile market) but premiums are too high. This strategy helps to decrease premiums"
2021-05-23 21:20:34,wallstreetbets,Ah haha ha.
2021-05-23 23:44:07,wallstreetbets,2.98
2021-05-23 22:04:47,wallstreetbets,you don't understand. lots of people made TONS of money last year doing exactly this. someone who bought calls last year and made 8 figures isn't going to invest like a boomer overnight.
2021-05-23 20:12:03,wallstreetbets,This is actually a pretty good bet. But a longer expiration would probably be much safer. But definitely a good bet. If SPY falls down (based on the price-action most likely it will) this guy would be making close to half a mil. Definitely a good bet.
2021-05-23 23:09:20,wallstreetbets,"you don't know what expandable/disposable $ means

2021-05-24 06:28:59,wallstreetbets,Yes unless someone gave it to you
2021-05-24 00:02:07,wallstreetbets,should you trade ES options if you're < $1M?
2021-05-24 04:52:09,wallstreetbets,SPY options are the most liquid contracts there are
2021-05-23 22:47:33,wallstreetbets,I stand corrected. Curious though. Do you have friends such as yourself that would play money like this?
2021-05-24 07:54:42,wallstreetbets,You would vomit from a <1% loss of net worth?
2021-05-23 22:42:41,wallstreetbets,Meh I don’t mind the yolo tag. This is entertaining to 99% of us so let go and enjoy the thrill.
2021-05-24 14:12:04,wallstreetbets,accumulating 300k isn’t hard with a lucky string of consecutive yolo options wins. 6 consecutive double or nothing wins with gains reinvested from $5k gets you over $300k. We’ve had a fair share of 6-day rallies in this market with people gambling with otm calls. it just won’t last long because at some point that strategy will fail and nosedive to 0. this happens all the time in this sub with people who get lucky and gamble all their winnings away

2021-05-24 12:42:16,wallstreetbets,Portfolio margin?

2021-05-24 08:32:02,wallstreetbets,"Remember during Trump election night when the market dropped \~100 handles? ES puts, easy profit. If you had SPY puts you couldn't get out and by the time the market opened they were deep in the red and never recovered. Even SPX you could at least get out at 2am. SPY ain't a winner when it comes to liquidity in globex. On top of that SPY doesn't get preferential cap gains tax treatment and each contract is cheaper which means you'd be paying for more contracts for the same amount of capital. More contracts = more commissions at scale. All these factors combined more than offset any marginal intraday liquidity SPY contracts have."

OG SpaceX engineers that formed SpaceX to what they are today work for Virgin Galactic now. This test flight was a 90% chance of success (IMO) given the delays, it was not going to fail. Why in the flying fuck didn't I go all in on Friday. Drinking this one off because I'm a huge pussy. Scared money don't make money


Edit: And congrats to those that went all in on Friday. You 100% deserve all your gains. Enjoy. I love spaceflight and root for any company in the sector."

This fligh actually generates revenue because they took some nasa instrumets to space.  Now we have another ship, ""imagine"", when they show in march, nonbody cares because people thought not even ""unity"" was able to go to space, now we know we have two ships with the tech to go to space. The richard branson flight could be for his birthday in july, and he is  taking the training to go to space, and now we also have the interest of you guys from wsb.

2021-05-24 02:06:11,wallstreetbets,"Statistics, search analytics, history, etc. People who are willing to buy diamonds have been choosing natural diamonds over lab grown diamonds since the 50s. Only recently have lab grown diamonds become popular mainstream."
2021-05-24 02:07:45,wallstreetbets,Yes but do you have any evidence aside from conjecture? I can say that lab grown diamonds have been popular for a long while and is accurate.
2021-05-24 03:01:50,wallstreetbets,"Took me 2 minutes to google it. I even used google’s analytics tool to figure out that searches for lab grown diamonds barely started increasing in around 2016.

It is conjecture with no evidence. Plus 5 years *is* a long while. It's over 2,628,000,000 minutes. That's quite a bit of time."
2021-05-24 17:57:27,wallstreetbets,"I don’t use Imgur so I’m not going to link screenshots of info I found in the front page of google. 

And lab grown diamonds have been around since the 50s. They’ve only gained a significant increase in attention these past 5 years. I’m not gonna do the math, you obviously can. Figure out the difference in minutes between 70 years and 5 years. 

I did my 5 minutes of research."
2021-05-24 17:58:58,wallstreetbets,"There are other image hosting sites so it's just apathy on your part. I appreciate your non evidence and conjecture still. I didn't do the math earlier. I used a calculator lol. Why wouldn't you?

2021-05-24 03:01:33,wallstreetbets,3 calls at 48 strike for July? Even with a successful test flight you need SPCE to go up almost 300% from 21 to 65 for you to even begin winning $300 for every $1 increase in SPCE stock. OP what was your rationale   for buying the FDs?

2021-05-24 03:09:45,wallstreetbets,I bought this late last year in preparation for the ARKX that came out in April but all futures crashed.
2021-05-24 03:20:40,wallstreetbets,"That explains why you overpaid for the calls, doesn’t explain why you didn’t unload the position at 50% loss or something. Good luck burning the last 150$ of this position. True degenerate"
2021-05-24 03:53:36,wallstreetbets,"tell me what are the chance $SPCE will go above $67.70 by 7/16 ???  you  will need about more than 200% move to the upside in less than 2 months.

and thats going to be a new all time high.

OP probably bought this contract back in February, its already lost almost all of its premium even though there are still almost 2 months left.

next ER is on 8/9 (as per TOS), it may gets a pop for ER run-up... but by that time theta most likely ate most of the premium.

&#x200B;

what if $SPCE moves side ways ? or not high enough ? or moving even lower... 11/25/19 low was $6.90

&#x200B;

sometimes when you are wrong you just have to admit it, but hey if you think you should just let it expires worthless then go ahead, its your money.

&#x200B;

Good luck !"

2021-05-24 02:07:50,wallstreetbets,I think the strike prices aren’t far enough out for me. I only have shares but will start selling covered calls when it gets to $50-60 range and use that for income. If they get taken from me at that price I won’t mind.

2021-05-24 16:21:51,wallstreetbets,Dude that’s really good news for UWMC. That’s a large purchase for how low the float is. Add in a Russell inclusion that’s bad news for shorts.
2021-05-24 00:33:32,wallstreetbets,".40 dividend per year pretty good at $7, at least there is something there."
2021-05-24 09:59:21,wallstreetbets,"I did some research based on a couple of DD’s some time ago. Mainly the dividend, aggressive style of the CEO and their numbers looked promising. I set a buy order and got lucky."
2021-05-24 17:12:35,wallstreetbets,"Because this stock is a snail, will slowly bleed out, regardless of how good it is on paper and your options will expire worthless. (Speaking from experience - multiple times!)"
2021-05-24 10:31:08,wallstreetbets,"Options activity has no impact on supply and demand for shares of the underlying. SP is strictly caused by underlying trading, not by options. But you do you."
2021-05-24 10:54:03,wallstreetbets,"When you buy an option, the market maker who sold it to you has to hedge. They hedge the number of shares = to the options current delta (for calls, they short to the same number for puts) hedging is (theoretically) forced by law or they lose MM status

So Yes, options directly influence share price.

remember GAMMA SQUEEZES?

You literally just had it explained it an earlier post yet you're doubling down on wrong.


Go look at any options scanner for a huge sweep. you'll see a corresponding volume AND price jump on the 1 minute chart at that time as MMs scramble for shares to hedge."
2021-05-24 11:10:58,wallstreetbets,I’ll double and triple down all day. Options have no impact on SP. corporations issue boatloads of options to their employees with zero impact on their SP. what sometimes happens is a correlation (coincidental). That is not a causation. You are wrong to think that if people buy and sell calls it has a direct impact on SP.
2021-05-24 11:36:35,wallstreetbets,"THose are different you ****&***.

They pay those out with shares they already own or just create them out of nothing and dilute. No corporation is giving their employees the equivalent of unhedged calls.

Thatws such dumb business that I'm actually getting kind of worried about you.

well steve, we could buy/issue all these shares now, or we could do it in 5 years and 2x price? Yeah just wait its fibne.

Your employee stock options are closer to covered calls (but still not the same).

I'll be messaging the mods to see if we can get you banned. You're tripling down on idiocy when you have all the info directly in front of your eye."
2021-05-24 12:46:29,wallstreetbets,Let me try and word it differently. Buying options  don’t ever affect SP but exercising options at a single strike price on a huge number of contracts might cause some SP change. Ergo gamma squeeze.
2021-05-24 11:53:02,wallstreetbets,Options have no impact on the underlying SP. Correlation doesn’t mean causation.
2021-05-24 11:58:32,wallstreetbets,"if the option writers don’t own the shares and sell calls, when they expire ITM they have to buy the shares to deliver. Many option writers are selling naked, which results in gamma squeeze. si?"
2021-05-24 12:08:46,wallstreetbets,"Si! When options expire ITM, and said shares are  then bought, SP is affected indeed. 
My point all along. 
Options don’t affect SP. Buying shares affect SP. Happy that we all agree."
2021-05-24 12:48:21,wallstreetbets,Okay now the thing is if it’s likely they’ll expire ITM they will start to cover. It happens earlier than expiration.
2021-05-24 12:54:27,wallstreetbets,"Right. It is pretty basic. SP is only affected by buying/selling shares. If the Option result in a sale transaction (no matter the mechanism), it will affect the SP indeed. 
But you can purchase any option calls if you desire, the underlying SP won’t be affected until a sale transaction of a share occurs. ITM options might trigger the underwriter to purchase shares. It is the purchase of the share that impact its underlying price, not the purchase of a call."
2021-05-24 12:56:19,wallstreetbets,so... options affect the buying and selling of a stock... affecting the stock price.
2021-05-24 13:00:29,wallstreetbets,"Again, technically, only if they get exercised. What you describe is a hypothetical case that could in certain very rare circumstances possibly impact the SP. I’m describing the empirical theory of option trading. The theory is options don’t affect SP until and if they get exercised."

2021-05-23 20:08:15,wallstreetbets,"Those should be ok either way. If it really runs all day then they’d be a nice hit, but I think a sell off of any gains early is what’s more likely to happen."

In response to your #4 point - RKT posted over 2 billion in Net income with over a 200% increase YOY. Thats where you find it. Look at how that stock is turning out.

Figure out whether you’re posting a value play or a short squeeze play because it’s definitely not both. A short squeeze is the only way it’s going to go up and for that reason only I’m considering a position for like a day. Afterwards, it will trade sideways for eight months because it’s new to the market and that’s what happens. Then it’s gonna tank down to $3 a share because no one gives a shit about mortgage company in a rising rate environment. Although most retail here is still bag holding because they read this post and actually we’re motivated to buy a bit too late.  

Anyone with a brain isn’t investing in RKT because of mortgage origination revenue so you posted a mortgage company long term play here then this is truly retarded. If you actually compare the reports you’re essentially comparing apples to oranges. If you remember, you’re actually only on this sub because the company piggybacked off of RKTs publicity during the squeeze in March.

2021-05-24 01:50:28,wallstreetbets,lmao so if rates go up refinances go down home prices fall wouldnt more demand come in to new home loans as more people can now afford new home loans. Who dominates the new home loan market again?

I see a clear rotation out of high p/e multiples/tech into energy, financials, and basic materials - https://imgur.com/a/DRCQTPV.  This was to be expected with massive debt-financed fiscal stimulus packages that aren't stimulative as a consequence of rates being at the zero bound.  While bonds have reacted negatively to these fiscal packages, the short term boost to yields will be short-lived on the macroeconomic scale.  Downward pressure on yields will resume and issuing more debt while rates are near zero is only going to continue to slow the velocity of money - https://imgur.com/a/qFEaIRm and take away from monetary's liquidity spout, driving high P/Es even lower and redirecting passive flows toward value - https://imgur.com/a/ooDcJhc.  We've seen this story before"
2021-05-24 02:08:32,wallstreetbets,The low rates and flood of liquidity to spur aggregate demand are symptoms of a sick system. The low rates are (at least in some part) evidence that the market can't work out where to efficiently put the capital to return a high yield- or at least there are not enough good high yielding places to take up all the spare cheap capital. The flood of liquidity is a cheap substitute for actual supply side economics (productivity) which gives the appearance of health but you can't aggregate demand your way out of  a sick economy without some strong Austrians.
2021-05-24 02:14:30,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, you're right. It is a weird time. But that doesn't go for you or against the argument. It is strange times. You actually have (in part) nationalized debt from the year of lockdowns and a Fed and Gov that have no wiggle room because the Fed can't respond if  inflation moves up because it will have to tighten money supply, which may have impacts on the markets, which may mean the Fed has to provide liquidity to the markets, which would loosen money supply, which would be inflationary. Meanwhile the Fed is pretty much financing the Gov bonds and what happens when Rep and Dems have to negotiate the debt ceiling or if Feds can't finance the Gov bonds because it is inflationary? All the macro levers might be jammed."
2021-05-24 02:19:20,wallstreetbets,Hyperinflation comes during war (especially if losing) whilst productive capacity is blown to shit and aggregate demand is at peak.

2021-05-23 23:22:08,wallstreetbets,"Government spending and inflation are not synonymous. Inflation doesn’t just happen when you foster policy requirements for taking money...i.e infrastructure spending, work programs, higher education-vocational school  spending, ending corporate tax subsidies(at least reform). You cant just go “spending bad” without providing context. Like FDR, Truman, and Eisenhower were massive government spending administrations, but the economy grew for everyone. Yes, when you just print money and don’t incentivize building things...guess what? You got a whole lot of useless money."

2021-05-24 00:02:11,wallstreetbets,Can you give a short summary?
2021-05-24 16:04:41,wallstreetbets,"While I don't want any crash to destroy the economy. I figured I'd pose this as a question.

Is no one else concerned about the idea of everyone, everything being treated equally in our system?

No one bails out the little guy when he fails.

Just figured I'd mention it. But I get the utilitarian argument for preventing the big guys from failing, massive amount of suffering. Result justifies differential treatment of bigger businesses/banks.

Obviously we can't let important things fail, like power grids, and in turn power companies. By the nature of how important something is to us, we can't treat it equally and let some things fail?

Always some weird line of what people consider the greater good. Ideals vs suffering? idk. Something to think about I guess?.

I might be wrong. But it's probably important to not let banks fail with a fiat based currency and a national bank.

Without a national bank and fiat currency, it's much less important if a bank fails. Probably no need to bail them out."
2021-05-24 00:36:04,wallstreetbets,You know this will still cause massive inflation? The only way to stop it is to literally delete the printed money.
2021-05-24 02:11:11,wallstreetbets,"Yup fractional reserve banking means technically they don’t need to have money on hand.. in fact the can lend out ghost dollars or naked dollars aka money they don’t have. 

Sounds familiar?  

This has been a great read; will inflation happen? Sure just not on 3rd country 50% or more status.

The issue is that trickledown eco never worked. In this society the shareholder is first hence why Capitalism sucks, no matter what the rich will horde ..

The best model I’ve heard as of late is thst one you hit a cap net worth wide you should be limited from hoarding more and give the nest guy a chance .. like Mario kart 😂"

2021-05-24 05:04:33,wallstreetbets,If it helps retail investors out there then I am happy
2021-05-24 12:51:57,wallstreetbets,"Sure, when banks receive reserves, it is a double entry on the accounting side. So a little back to accounting 101. a Deposit is both an asset and liability on the books. Asset because you can lend out the money in the future and earn interest. Liability because you have to pay back the money to the depositor plus interest.  There are minimum capital requirements for liabilities. So if you get more cash in the form of deposits or otherwise but not making enough loans on the other side, it means that you have to find other sources of raising liquidity. Failing which, you miss your minimum regulatory requirements."

2021-05-24 09:31:02,wallstreetbets,Government spending of printed money causes inflation. Taxing normal money of course doesn’t cause inflation as there is no change to the money supply but right now the only thing stopping massive inflation is low velocity of the printed money but taxing it and spending it will cause the effects to occur.
2021-05-23 23:47:08,wallstreetbets,"Yes, you totally get it! That is why banks do not want to take on anymore money. And that is the case we make. In 2008 banks happily accepted cash and hoarded it. So a lot of money did not make it into the real economy. This limited supply of money in the real economy and kept inflation from rising. Now the situation is quite the opposite which is alarming."

You know what's even worse about the houses? Destroying *ten* houses and rebuilding *two* houses is seen as economic growth. Especially because the resulting supply shortage allows you to charge exorbitant rent."
2021-05-24 13:23:40,wallstreetbets,"What are the supermarket greeters hired for? I guess, to give people a better feeling. That is useful, even if the usefulness is close to zero. Its still better than doing something complete useless or how you pointed out something which destroys real value instead of creating it. 

Your example with the two houses ( a good example by the way) is a consequence of inflation too. Rich people have assets (stocks, houses, ...) The prices of these assets are rising during inflation while the money at the bank accounts stays the same. So inflation takes money from the poor and the middle class and give it to the rich. It leads to a widening of the wealth gap. Think about all the countries with wide wealth gaps. Think about most of the countries with wide wealth gaps have high inflation. Compare Italy to Germany or the USA to Mexico.  And when your wealth gap has grown it makes sense to replace 10 houses for middle class people against two houses for rich people."
2021-05-24 14:04:49,wallstreetbets,Do you think the usefulness of a supermarket greeter is greater or less than the usefulness of 40 hours/week of leisure time?
2021-05-24 17:25:58,wallstreetbets,You add tariffs to help local goods compete in price with foreign made goods. We are not logging enough. We will have to end up buying Canadian lumber anyways. Open up the logging in the PNW. What a screwed up government we have.
2021-05-24 06:01:44,wallstreetbets,Harvesters are not cutting everything in Oregon. The environmentalists have had the timber industry locked up with lawsuits for 40yrs. Can only log on private land. BLM lands are filled with trees that seldom are allowed to be harvested. Log and replant.

2021-05-24 10:43:43,wallstreetbets,"No, I mean an industry who’s prices have tripled in less than a year as a result of devastating wildfires in California.

I get it, you watched the lumber industry break into your home and kill your family while you watched hiding under the bed as a kid.  However, please don’t allow that to continue to cloud your judgement.

The reason we are running out of industry in the US is because we are so quick to import everything cheap from shithole countries that don’t play by the rules.  Canada subsidizes the fuck out of their lumber industry and it’s been an issue for decades."
2021-05-24 11:36:22,wallstreetbets,Last year it was 35$. High demand for wood (locally and for export) with low supplies.
2021-05-24 06:11:08,wallstreetbets,Where in the PNW is every tree being harvested ? That is a lie. The harvest isn't even close to what it was before the eighties. We have huge stands of timber on the Oregon Coast that need to be harvested and processed. Mills need to reopen and bring back better paying jobs. Trees are being processed off shore in huge factory mills and brought back. No labor regulations.
2021-05-24 11:44:20,wallstreetbets,And we get crap lumber too
2021-05-24 06:24:35,wallstreetbets,"Changed policies forced by the environmentalists. It's really fucked up because all they know is activism not forestry practices. It's all emotions. Don't cut the trees. I have watched it for 42years. We used to have 5 big mills and some small private ones on the Siuslaw River between Eugene and Florence, Oregon. It was booming and now it's not. The trees are still there."
2021-05-24 14:20:01,wallstreetbets,"I find the extreme side of all these passionate good sounding things always go awry and they then leave the pieces for the locals to pick up.  I mean I am more liberal leaning than not but when I hear stories like this it makes me fume... And see why many are driven to the opposite political spectrum.

I recently read about blue line beetle fungus and logging those infected is actually good for the forests.  You don't hear that from the extreme treehuggers.  It must suck to see your local economy devastated because of such extremism, man."
2021-05-24 15:20:03,wallstreetbets,It's never fully recovered. The mills are gone. If they did reopen the logging where will they process. When traveling through Coos Bay on HWY101 on the east side. Thousands of logs are limbed and stacked with the bark still on. They shipped off shore to a processing ship and then brought back as lumber. There are also mountains of chips that will be turned into press board. But won't be done on our soil. Pretty crazy isn't it?
2021-05-24 17:07:17,wallstreetbets,"It certainly sucks .  I actuallly read it takes what, 20-30 years to get mil la fully capacity, which is insane to shut it down for reasons not based in economics and proper environmental science.  Such a shame :-("

2021-05-23 23:09:57,wallstreetbets,"Inflation is always transient because it's always changing. No one thinks that it means that the inflation from the past is suddenly cancelled out. It means that it does not get to a certain point and say hey, I will stay here forever. The US has experienced many ebbs and flows of inflation. It is a tricky thing to handle because deflation is arguably more detrimental than inflation (i.e. your debt becomes more burdensome in a deflationary environment, and in contrast, more manageable in an inflationary environment). 

This is what's been going on in Japan for quite some time and has led to a sort of eternal downward spiral for the buying power of its citizens.

You either have inflation or deflation over time....the magnitudes will vary place to place, country to country, based on what the economy in question is doing at the moment. Hopefully you don't think that socialism in and of itself causes inflation, because the US is awfully good at making inflation happen with capitalism"

Its shitty but if you play differently you can profit from these, on the way up and down. Everything that gets overreaction from the market usually corrects. If it goes very high, you can expect to go lower , if it goes too low it will recover.  

Its like everything is always amplified at first then adjusted to ""normal"" or trending levels."

Can’t complain about 5% gain or higher on a daily basis, and I believe if SP is bouncing this much solely from speculation I can TELL we are going to at least 10 dollars a share when Souki announces FID & the 4 or 5 business partners they have chosen for 10-15 years.

Patience will pay off here; if anyone is going to secure a deal it’s definitely their team. Others may get deals as well, but as Souki has stated recently, “we couldn’t be in a better place right now.”🙌🏻"

[The 15-Stock Diversification Myth ](http://www.efficientfrontier.com/ef/900/15st.htm)

> … **a grossly disproportionate fraction of the total return came from a very few ""superstocks""** like Dell Computer, which increased in value over 550 times. If you didn’t have one of the half-dozen or so of these in your portfolio, then you badly lagged the market. (The **odds of owing one of the 10 superstocks are approximately one in six.**) Of course, by owning only 15 stocks you also increase your chances of becoming fabulously rich. But unfortunately, in investing, it is all too often true that **the same things that maximize your chances of getting rich also maximize your chances of getting poor.**

> …even 100 stocks are not nearly enough to eliminate this very important source of financial risk.

> So, yes, Virginia, you can eliminate nonsytematic portfolio risk, as defined by Modern Portfolio Theory, with a relatively few stocks. It’s just that nonsystematic risk is only a small part of the puzzle. Fifteen stocks is not enough. Thirty is not enough. Even 200 is not enough. **The only way to truly minimize the risks of stock ownership is by owning the whole market.**

2021-05-24 04:15:02,wallstreetbets,"Legacy have and always have been able to scale with proper production. The first mass market bev was the leaf, then came the bolt. All those hit schedule with no issue. 

And no they didn't have to go through production hell and not have to build from a tent.

Right now monthly production of the mach e is from one plant and at about 6k a month. There has been 20k produced and most are still in the pipeline to the dealers. The cuautitlan plant will peak at 11k a month roughly, when the ramp completes.

The first year projected sales is 50k but when it is fully ramped you're looking at maybe 130k or so per year out of one plant. Not much but it is a good start. I really don't know if it will need to produce any faster, depending on the demand I suppose. 

I remember a time in 2017 in which not a car company was supposed to complete ramp in 2nd half, but only made 2.5k in the entire Q4. But anyways, I digress. Producing cars are difficult business, not all companies are suited for it.

Not a car company is truly the hare in the tortoise and the hare story here. Building fast and making mistakes quickly but got complacent."
2021-05-24 07:59:37,wallstreetbets,"Tesla scales a line to 120,000/year within 90 days and max cap of 250,000 within the year.

The very first time was slow?  You mean just like everybody else?

I don't think you realize how insignificant of a volume 50K/year is.   That kind of capital efficiency and ROC means bankruptcy, not competitiveness.

Ford might be the best short idea this year.   Sure, the american banks approve, but many have a PT below 13.    The german banks have a range of 5-7.50.  The algos don't predict the price, but have a trading range from 4 to 13."

2021-05-24 16:19:22,wallstreetbets,"Yes. DeGiro is an “interactive Broker” if I recall correctly. This means that they expect that you yourself will contact them when you want to vote. I don’t know which specific e-mailadres  you need to contact, so I would recommend you to contact their support mail first. For me (as a dutchie) that is “klanten@degiro.nl”. So look out for such an e-mailadres. Include in your mail that you want to vote at the shareholders meeting of GME. Then they will send you an email explaining how you can contact their corporate actions department. Just send me a message if you’ve got further questions!"
2021-05-24 16:29:37,wallstreetbets,Thank you very much! I live in Belgium. I assume you live in the Netherlands? How do I know when the shareholder meeting is from a certain stock?
2021-05-24 16:45:36,wallstreetbets,"I indeed live in the Netherlands yeah :). Companies these days mostly have “investor relations” websites setup to share information with shareholders. Like: https://investor.gamestop.com/home. If you’re actively invested in a stock, I would recommend to search for those pages, so you can always stay up tot date with the recent information. Things like the shareholders meeting announcement can always be found on here first."
2021-05-24 16:55:36,wallstreetbets,Thank you! I just found out there is a meeting tomorrow so I guess I’ll have to wait till next year 🙃.
2021-05-24 17:03:44,wallstreetbets,"Sorry, are you referring to the GameStop meeting? That isn’t until the 9th of June, so could still vote if you’ve bought your shares before 16 April 2021."

Pioneer paid $6.4bn for Permian operator DoublePoint, which comes with about 100,000 boe/d of production and 97,000 net acres adjacent to and overlapping Pioneer's own Midland Basin footprint in the eastern Permian.

On that basis, a back on the envelope calc implies TPL’s 880,000 acreage would be worth $58bn or $7400/share. Even if we assume that Pioneer paid a 50% controlling premium, we are still looking at a TPL valuation of $3700/share, versus $1500/share today."

You set your work week at around 24 hours, part-time, which leaves you in the income bracket to both receive food stamps, medicaid nationally, and never have to file taxes again, since you're exempt from all withholding if you earn below poverty-level wages.
