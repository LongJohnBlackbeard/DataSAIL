2021-05-08 19:34:41,stocks,sounds like a lot of feelings and not a lot of logic.

2021-05-08 19:52:21,stocks,"Whether or not you get rewarded or punished with your stock picks, just realize that correlation and causation are very different things. 

You're summarizing headlines for the past week or so and attempting to rationalize how it's all related or building up to an extreme outlier event in the near future. It's the kind of thinking lazy movie/tv show writers do when they have an ending and clear objectives laid out beforehand and just try and connect the dots as they write the script and develop the plot. 

Please don't leverage your money with this type of thinking. It's not sustainable, and you will eventually get burned for it."

If you have a lot of individual stocks in your portf.

What I didn‚Äôt see mentioned, which will add to your thesis, is how BABA is an open ended market. 87% of the US uses the internet vs about 67% on China using the web. This is NOT a bearish view of China E commerce. Although only 20% more, they don‚Äôt have 300 million people- they have 2 billion. 33% of China is 600 million people that will be future customers.

2021-05-08 18:48:00,stocks,It is my biggest USD holding!  Averaging $261. Holding and probably doubling down shortly as this is a long term play for me.  China will surpass the US economy as #1 globally in my lifetime and Baba is not going anywhere and will be a beneficiary of the growing middle class in China. My only fear is the US becomes irrational and starts a war instead of realizing they are in the twilight of their power.

Chinese company managed by the CCP. I don't screw around with CCP companies. Never know when the CEO may say the wrong thing and need to be ""re-educated"", damaging the companies profit and revenue. Also, you never know what their actual numbers are, which makes it difficult to evaluate a company's performance."

2021-05-08 18:57:01,stocks,"I was simply trying to say that it was short in length, but I guess it came out wrong :D Your point has been duly noted!

That's a very good point actually. I think I mention that China is the fastest growing economy, but you're right, there's a very large untapped segment of the market that could potentially be targeted by Alibaba :)"
2021-05-08 18:43:01,stocks,"I think it'll take a while, but it will pay off. I've got 10% of my portfolio in it, got a -7.5% so far, but I think it will jump after the earnings call next week."

2021-05-08 18:54:37,stocks,People in my home country don't even look at Amazon - they'd rather wait for 1 month to get something cheaper from Alibaba and that tells you everything you need to know :D
2021-05-08 18:58:35,stocks,"Without a doubt, we can already see the US economy slowing down. Well, it's not slowing down in terms of stats, but the only reason behind that is Mr Powell and his favourite money printer :D"
2021-05-08 19:11:37,stocks,"It's a good idea to be skeptic in these cases and I would be ***if*** the company was tiny. Alibaba is huge though - the fact that they've got 2 of the biggest online marketplaces in the world is a fact - it's a statistic taken from Amazon's Alexa! They've got a lot going for them and I think that the stats are correct. Plus, they're an online company, it's much harder to forge those stats. It ain't you mom-and-pop corner shop

Yes, their previous CEO did say the wrong thing, but now he's not involved with the company and there's no reasons why that would be an issue going forward."
2021-05-08 19:27:43,stocks,Couldn't agree more. Learned the hard way chinese companies and their stock price exist only by grace of the govt. Not touching any chinese stocks ever again.

My other fave Stock for China is HUIZ. I‚Äôd say abt 65% of my portfolio is in HUIZ. The Chinese insurance market is skyrocketing. Rest of the world isn‚Äôt even close. 

I have a few FUTU shares too. 

But this was a good anal. It‚Äôs a safe growth stock. Tough to lose $ on it"
2021-05-08 18:53:42,stocks,b Uy more!!
2021-05-08 19:17:09,stocks,"The problem is that as difficult as it might seem the CCP is not an amateur organization. I am not saying the numbers are fake, I am saying more often than nit the CCP falsifies numbers to ensure the success of the companies they choose or to protect their image. Keep in mind that BABA is restricted to doing business in line with China's politics and how they see fit to manage the company. That can shift at any time and BABA could take a hit because of it. 

It is always best to steer clear of Chinese companies when it come to purchasing stocks. You never know when someone might say the wrong thing or the CCP gets pissy because they catch a headline that makes them look like the demons they are.

There are plenty of other options to make money with regular risks not relying on how well a genocidal government gets along with others."
2021-05-08 19:35:45,stocks,"Thanks :) HUYA and DOYU are also two good stocks I'm looking at, but they need more research. The streaming market in China is off the charts though!"
2021-05-08 19:18:50,stocks,"That's a fair comment. I understand where you're coming from and I get the risk, but I still think they are a decent bet especially given the price."

2021-05-08 19:30:53,stocks,Are they container only company or dry shipping too? Dry shipping is very volatile
2021-05-08 19:27:51,stocks,"It peaked around a 12.5 PE. Several ways to read that, I guess."
2021-05-08 17:49:42,stocks,"I think a lot of speculation is already build into the current stockprice. Short term/mid term this could be a good play, but long term I think this will experience a correction due to demand in construction come back to ""normal"". 

To be fair I believe you made some good points. And your DD report sounds good. It's just that with the infrastructure bill all of these construction stocks rose."

But, they also charge $3/month if you have any funds invested on top of whatever the expense ratio is so for now, I‚Äôve just left it alone."
2021-05-08 17:50:00,stocks,"Hubby has HSA Bank though work which invests through TD Ameritrade. No big complaints, works fine to purchase VTI, no fees."
2021-05-08 18:40:04,stocks,HealthEquity. They‚Äôre alright. Investment options are decent. Cost is a little higher.
2021-05-08 17:57:29,stocks,"Fees and investment options could be different if you are coming in directly and not through employer. I think...

Make calls ?"
2021-05-08 19:01:14,stocks,"Does your employer contribute to your HSA? My employer don't, and I just use Fidelity rather than using my employer's. Of course the money doesn't come out directly from my paycheck."
2021-05-08 17:32:31,stocks,"Thank you. No fees, right?  Aside from fund fees obviously"
2021-05-08 18:10:02,stocks,So we have it through employer too. But I thought we could transfer to any bank/provider?  Am I wrong?
2021-05-08 18:39:43,stocks,I do this too. Very satisfied.
2021-05-08 19:04:25,stocks,Same. But I thought I had to use theirs and put it in what they recommend. I now am realizing that I can transfer (I think?)
2021-05-08 18:29:29,stocks,Not 100% sure. Probably depends on how the plan is set up/rules are written for it.
2021-05-08 16:41:05,stocks,There might be a future catalyst that hold potential value. Just because a company has debt on the books doesn‚Äôt mean it holds no value. Maybe they are using that money to build the company which has a high potential of success in the future.

2021-05-08 19:23:39,stocks,"The idea is probably that it won't lose money in perpetuity. 

It costs a lot of money to set a company up for national or even international growth. Negative EPS doesn't mean that a company is a loser."
2021-05-08 18:45:22,stocks,I get that. How is institutional ownership defined? What is an institution? Is it any fund that is not an individual insider?
2021-05-08 19:03:19,stocks,"Be careful, some of the big holding inst with unknown names are the ones who brought the shat companies public. Very deceiving if you're looking for a quality company."
2021-05-08 15:15:14,stocks,"so yeah, barring wash sale issues, this would work, but the main issue is that you don't want to reset your cost basis (most of the time, im sure you can find scenarios where you do). the reasoning behind why you don't want to reset it is because then you have to pay taxes. time value of money says that money today is worth more than money tomorrow, so you would rather pay taxes as far down the road as you possibly can. would you rather pay $100 taxes today or $100 of taxes in 5 years? while resetting this basis definitely could work and then you have a higher basis, why pay money now in taxes to do that, when you could sell in 5 years and just pay the taxes then? on paper it seems like it could be a good idea, but in practice you're just paying the government money now that you could have kept as unrealized gains."
2021-05-08 15:00:58,stocks,"As long as you dont buy 30 days before or after selling for the loss. So in this example, yes it should work as long as you dont buy any until april 1st. Edit: February is less than 30 days so technically i think youd be one or two day off. But if was another month then yes."
2021-05-08 19:42:39,stocks,"What if you BUY more stock simply to LOWER your cost basis, then sell that stock the next day do you get to keep your new lower cost basis? 

I bought TDOC last week on the dip to lower my basis and that‚Äôs all I wanted to do.  Now I want to sell the same amount and move it elsewhere.  Is that ok?"
2021-05-08 15:18:50,stocks,"The issue is that the stock is fairly volatile, had been growing faster than I expected this year and I really wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if it were to fall significantly within the year. I‚Äôm thinking at least with the way that I described it I‚Äôd be able to claim a loss against my initial gain if that were to happen."
2021-05-08 15:55:04,stocks,"The only reason to do it is if it is LT and his LT capital gains bracket is 0% this year.

Doing it for short term doesn‚Äôt make any sense unless you expect a huge change in marginal tax next year. And if you do it, do it in December, where the picture of your rates and gains is clearer."
2021-05-08 15:25:12,stocks,"Yes, but if you just didn‚Äôt sell then the loss would also cancel out your initial gain so it‚Äôs pretty much the same either way."
2021-05-08 15:30:05,stocks,"i guess the question is how long do you want to hold it. is it 1 year? 5 years? 20 years? in your example, if you bought at 10 and sold at 100, you owe the government taxes on $90, let's call $9 tax for simplicity sake. after you sold for a gain, you bought right back in at $100 and the next day the stock tanks and drops to $50 - you sell again (and wait 30 days, no wash sale, etc). you can realize this gain and loss on your tax return and you now owe $4 of tax ($9 gain offset by $5 of loss). if your goal is to hold long term, you owe the government $4 when you file your taxes, but all of the money you made from these transactions are tied up in the stock you bought, so now you need to pay this $4 out of pocket. if instead you never bought or sold, all of the money you invested would still be tied up in this stock, but you wouldn't owe the government anything when you file. the only difference now being that your cost basis is lower if you never sold, compared to if you did sell and buy back. you are correct that you'd be able to take a loss against the gain, but if youre going to hold it for 5 years and then sell, why even take the gain in the first place? if this is a short term play where you expect to be out by year end, wouldn't be horrible to sell and buy back, etc. for fear of loss, but if this is a long long term hold, it isn't extremely tax efficient to try and reset your basis"
2021-05-08 17:07:27,stocks,"yeah yeah youre right, there are definitely situations where its better to sell and take advantage of a step up!"
2021-05-08 15:52:59,stocks,"I see this more as a short term play, which isn‚Äôt usually what I go for (hence the new scenario for me). I imagine I may very well be out by years end. Thank you!"

2021-05-08 19:50:42,stocks,"I got in ET at 7.04. 40% increase so far, which has been absurd. My biggest regret isn't just dumping everything into that. Don't make me sad by letting me know wsb is aware of it."

I just don't understand technology enough to be able to judge if Intel can ""turn it around"" or not. Perhaps their technology and foundries etc. are too obsolete for them to catch up.

2021-05-08 16:42:39,stocks,"I have a lot to say on Intel, a lot of good, a good amount of bad. I already made a long comment about them in another thread, but I probably need to make a longer post.

My biggest concerns aren't AMD, or even ARM, they are if Intel can actually execute their promises for once in the last 5 years, and if the market actually cares, because if you look at Intel, even when they were at the top of their game, when AMD was nearing bankruptcy, and ARM was just for mobile chips, the market didn't care. They are treated like a blue chip, not a tech, and when the market actually shifts to blue chips, they don't shift to Intel. It's like the market hates Intel and just let's it trade sideways.

I'm not sure if I'll go long on Intel, they will either be a hidden gem that will double value in the upcoming years or you'll get your 3% dividend and have no other returns from them."

2021-05-08 13:58:12,stocks,"Hell yeah. All these stock-nationalists are kinda wierd, I'm investing for my future, not to change geopolitics. Baba is killing it and looks cheap right now.  

That said, I'm not expecting the stock price to rise much even after earnings next week. Its a slow burner."
2021-05-08 12:36:44,stocks,"Chinese company managed by the CCP. I don't screw around with CCP companies. Never know when the CEO may say the wrong thing and need to be ""re-educated"", damaging the companies profit and revenue. Also, you never know what their actual numbers are, which makes it difficult to evaluate a company's performance."
2021-05-08 12:48:01,stocks,Sold out of Baba @ 272 and glad I did it's gone straight down since. Put the money in Coupang out of South Korea. Because I wanted more asia e Commerce exposure but find that Chinese stocks are too intertwined to the government.
2021-05-08 12:52:36,stocks,"Nope, I wouldn't touch any Chinese stock with a 10 foot pole.

It may be undervalued, but it is simply not worth the time and stress of having to worry about what is going on in China to me. It is not like there is a shortage of great American companies for me to invest in that are easier for me to keep informed about since they are in the same country as me and won't cause me as much stress of always having to worry about what the CCP is going to do or what other shady things could be happening in China that would screw my investment. My time and peace of mind is too important to me for me to deal with Chinese stocks."
2021-05-08 14:44:53,stocks,"People say invest in Baba and they're probably right. But given it's Chinese and US/Chinese tensions are high, I ethically don't approve of China, and the CCP actively dislikes BABA, I'd rather just throw my money into S&P 500 tickers."
2021-05-08 12:39:32,stocks,Baba is the major winner from the US big stimulus package.
2021-05-08 13:30:17,stocks,"Nope. Not buying into Chinese stocks directly on principle. You don't grow big in China unless you're tolerated by the CCP, and that's where I draw the line."
2021-05-08 12:26:18,stocks,"I just bought for shares of BABA on Friday at $225.50
Also picked up 4 shares of Paypal.
Both should go up nicely from here."
2021-05-08 14:54:39,stocks,No I won't buy BABA. It is at the center of a massive antitrust investigation which could see some of Alibaba's valuable assets like media and browser such as UCBrowser being carved out. Not exactly sure but a lot of ppl in China feel Alibaba is too dominant in every industry and the investigation on Alibaba regarding forcing merchants to only use Alibaba Tmall and Taobao doesn't sit well. I will wait and see and how things go tho.
2021-05-08 14:39:31,stocks,Great idea in diversifying into different sectors. I am very very bullish on BABA and think its extremely undervalued. Their black cloud over its head for the longest time was when/how much the Chineses government was going to fine them for monopoly activities. February and the fine was not nearly as bad as people had planned for it to be. I currently have 9 shares in BABA averaging around $230 and will continuing to keep averaging down until we see a nice climb back to where it belongs. Another thing to note is that there earnings is this week on Thursday so make sure if you're scooping 5 more make sure its before then as I expect a nice little run after earnings.
2021-05-08 18:51:15,stocks,Fools gold.  The CCP gave the world Covid and now a rocket falling to earth.  You trust these losers?
2021-05-08 13:57:21,stocks,"It might look tempting looking at the financials and past growth, but the current anti-monopoly climate in China and the clampdown of the government convinces me to stay as far as possible from these stocks. I mean, antitrust cases in China hit different compared to US or Europe.. The CCP can do literally anything they want with these companies. Might be undervalued based on financials but they are dropping heavily because risks are being priced in. Just my opinion."
2021-05-08 16:07:40,stocks,"Alibaba runs some of the biggest data centers so yes, they own the digital real estate that cloud services run on. EXTREMELY undervalued."
2021-05-08 18:21:28,stocks,"I don't support aggressive regimes that murder people based on ethnicity, so no I don't."
2021-05-08 15:57:29,stocks,"By what metric does it look undervalued? 

Do you understand and believe their financials? Where are their earnings actually coming from?"
2021-05-08 17:04:01,stocks,"I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a bad idea, but I do think there‚Äôs better places to store your money. I think Americans really don‚Äôt understand the basic market fundamentals.

1. China has a rapidly expanding ‚Äúmiddle class‚Äù of people with a disposable income. Now that China is mostly done with its war on poverty, the next stage of government policy is focusing on improving conditions for those living just above the poverty line.

2. China is going to rapidly overtake the US. Compare China and the US growth over the last couple years. C‚Äômon do it, don‚Äôt just take my word for it. That‚Äôs to say nothing of the bananas growth potential the Belt and Road initiative offers."
2021-05-08 17:14:52,stocks,Owned it for a while still very bullish always a lot of noise that comes and goes but the company is a beast and will continue to crush earnings imo. It‚Äôs also diversified into a bunch of great sectors e-commerce fintech cloud
2021-05-08 19:11:46,stocks,Wait until they report. ü§Ø
2021-05-08 15:04:19,stocks,"I think that BABA seems undervalued. If we take a look at BABA's [statistics](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BABA/key-statistics?p=BABA) on Yahoo Finance, it has P/S ratio of 6.25, EV/Sales of 0.87, and EV/EBITDA of 2.97; all of these ratios are at a low point for the past four quarters. Additionally, it has a Beta of 0.8, which makes it less riskier than the general market."
2021-05-08 15:15:09,stocks,ill buy alibaba when it hits a new ATH to make sure it's not gonna hit a sell from the bagholders. only buy stuff in uptrend tbh
2021-05-08 12:45:13,stocks,"Ehh not really. How often do you find a cheap company right now? Not often, and not new cheap where people think 20 times earnings is cheap"
2021-05-08 12:35:30,stocks,"I think oil is not undervalued, but i have a lot of oil with 30% gains already, offcourse there are bargains, but solid us companies tend to be overvalued. Thanks for opinion"
2021-05-08 15:33:23,stocks,"This.

Not worth it when there's other just as good options or better without this risk."
2021-05-08 15:34:49,stocks,Nice this is a great idea!
2021-05-08 15:55:05,stocks,"Exactly. Look up what happened to Khodorkovsky after speaking up against Putin. Been seeing a lot of parallels with him and Jack Ma: 

1. Successful businessman in recently opened up economy

2. Richest man of the country at some point

3. Gets overzealous and speaks out against the government that helped make them rich

4. Look up the rest although I'd say the CCP won't be as nice as Putin."
2021-05-08 14:48:44,stocks,This.
2021-05-08 14:25:46,stocks,"Coupang has been going down since IPO, I wouldn't touch it until we find the bottom"
2021-05-08 14:45:12,stocks,"This. You can't count on numbers with chinese companies. Lot of the books are tinkered with and they have a state funded team to buy stocks to prop up their stockmarket. They ran overtime when covid hit and were buying massive amounts of shares to keep the prices from crashing. Burnt myself once too many, not touching them again."
2021-05-08 15:45:43,stocks,"If you don‚Äôt ethically approve of China, and the CPP dislikes BABA, wouldn‚Äôt you want to own BABA to see it shit in their faces when BABA succeeds?"
2021-05-08 19:13:34,stocks,">Ethically don't approve of China

Lmao what??? China the country?? It's government?? It's people? It's businesses?"
2021-05-08 15:26:03,stocks,What
2021-05-08 15:34:28,stocks,The bagholders be downvoting.
2021-05-08 17:57:03,stocks,Baba and the others are the most capitalistic force in China. And ultimately the government isn‚Äôt going to kill cash cows. I see baba jd and tencent ultimately as forces towards markets and away from totalitarian rule. Will they temporary put them in check? Sure. Chinese people deserve a free developing economy too.
2021-05-08 12:27:02,stocks,You mean 225? I bought also at 225.
2021-05-08 13:46:38,stocks,"The market doesn't work by having loads of easily identifiable undervalued companies.  There's loads of experts who their career is identifying those types of opportunities.  Taking advantage of them takes constant research and tracking and a lot of effort.  

I don't have time to keep up with loads of companies, but I do try to watch a few big sectors in the SP 500.  A couple that I was able to identify recently - 

Banks in general outperformed their pricing in the recent round of earnings.  I picked up Morgan Stanley when it was under 78 after earnings and the P/E was sub-11.

Kimberly Clarke has multi-year support at ~127, and touched it just the other day.  I didn't have any spare cash so didn't add any.

AMD was sub 77 this week, a long term support of them.  Decent PE ratio for a long term growth company that has solid earnings already.

Visa was 205 at the beginning of April, which is the bottom of their consolidation zone dating back to August.

Finding 'cheap' companies is about doing solid DD on sectors in advance, setting entry points on solid companies and then keeping up with them.  Buying at the right time is huge, and there has been plenty of opportunity in the past 3 months.  But saying everything is overpriced IS lazy and also ignores the reality that if something was obviously overpriced, it would be bought up instantly."
2021-05-08 14:34:08,stocks,"Plenty of high growth companies trading well below 20 times sales, some with single digit p/s ratios."
2021-05-08 17:31:58,stocks,"I can name you a few straight away:

Shell

Salesforce

Micron

TSMC

AMD (!!!)

Airbus (duopoly, can print their own money cause they have a bank subsidiary)

Fraport (Frankfurt Airport - it's still low as fuck and state owned)"
2021-05-08 14:55:35,stocks,Your not wrong there...I jump the gun a bit bought at 42 and 39 so in for 40.50. Plan on buying again if it hits 35. Wish I had waited but averaging down doesnt bother me. The loses are less as opposed to if I held Baba. But still bought to soon.
2021-05-08 16:32:17,stocks,I get your reasoning but China buying shares to keep prices from crashing is a good thing for shareholders lol.
2021-05-08 16:30:45,stocks,"Unless op means they don't approve of anything that has to do with China. Chinese food, Chinese people, Chinese Americans..... they are just confused."
2021-05-08 19:36:29,stocks,"I don't approve of the government specifically. I think the conflict between Baba and the CCP is interesting and I suppose supporting Baba doesn't directly support the CCP, but generally strengthens their economy and I imagine that they will eventually (like they have) impose restrictions or gain control/influence over Baba in some way shape or form."
2021-05-08 19:42:17,stocks,"I was referring to the government. I naturally assume it's implied - if it was the people or their food or culture, I would've been more clear. 

I do think a lot of small cap Chinese companies can be scams as I've read stories on this subreddit of fake startup companies that only exist to rake in investors money and never actually do anything. I realize Baba is definitely not that, but the fact that China doesn't allow foreigners to invest in some of their stocks isn't a good sign. The ticker Baba is actually just a shell company that people give their money and is linked to the earnings of Alibaba, but not directly Alibaba. I realize that this is functionally equivalent, but I see this as a danger from the CCP to potential investments. If the CCP starts to gain influence in the company and taking earnings (so far fees), then they can own a lot of BABA. But i have no idea what I'm talking about...which is why i just feel more secure with VTI or something generally

2021-05-08 12:40:04,stocks,"Yes, $225.50. lol sorry typo.  I think the $225 line is support on BABA, & $250 line is support on Paypal.  Both are long term excellent positions."
2021-05-08 19:57:43,stocks,I made the easiest 20% benefit I've ever made thanks to Airbus and I only bought the stock this February. It's still quite a bit below pre-pandemic levels despite the company managing it quite well and having the financial cushion to ride it out.
2021-05-08 17:05:19,stocks,"Very true, just saying that oversold/overbought indication doesn't work if you got a gvt funded team of brokers buying if share prices tank. Neither does price to book or EBITDA if books are tinkered with. Not complaining though, they probably saved us from a much bigger crash in march 2020 cause the whole world was watching china like a hawk lol. And if the company or ceo does something the govt doesn't like it can tank in a heartbeat. Had a couple of those in portfolio, from hero to zero overnight. Wasn't laughing thenüòâ"
2021-05-08 19:43:13,stocks,Lmao AliBABA
2021-05-08 18:28:22,stocks,No moat. Doesn't PayPal have a same type of offering? Would not wanna go against a Goliath like PayPal.
2021-05-08 12:17:57,stocks,"Finally some afrm posts.  Yeah I bought near IPO prices and am bummed out.  Had to average down a few times.  Still bullish on this company.  Who doesn't like but now pay later.  The contract with pelaton is huge for both companies.  Most people can't fork over that kind of money for their products of not for AFRM.  0 percent APR?   Right now according to CNBC the TAM for bnpl transactions is only 2 percent of all sales.  That should be growing.  I'm bullish on AFRM, I can't believe the stock is doing what is doing.   I guess people just are down on growth stocks in general.   Hope they start making inroads into Europe.  Long hold for me, I think this one's gonna be good."
2021-05-08 12:15:09,stocks,Isn‚Äôt Peloton 90% of AFRM business? If their sales slump that could be a large part of it.
2021-05-08 17:27:36,stocks,Nearly 14b market cap with just 500 million in revenues and negative cash flow. What is your thesis that it ever reaches that market cap. Lending has been a historically difficult field and a 20x P/S ratio will be hard to justify for any industry -  let alone an extremly competitive one such as lending.
2021-05-08 13:45:48,stocks,"I feel like ""in the midst of praying for an economic recovery"" is a bad time to be betting on subprime consumer lending."
2021-05-08 17:37:13,stocks,It IPOed not too long ago brah. It is finding its fair value instead of that outrageous price it has been at. It is about to finaly be a buy. I am watching very closely for initial investment. Never buy IPO.
2021-05-08 18:22:24,stocks,"IPOs have been crazy overpriced on the frist day of trading and in general are volatile the first few months.  There is also a lot of competition for those types of services.  I'm sure peleton also hurt business, but really it's finally getting close to a more accurate value imo."
2021-05-08 12:26:09,stocks,I just bought in 375 Shares at $56. I think i‚Äôll hold for bit. Definitely see some good upside potential in the company.
2021-05-08 12:26:23,stocks,It‚Äôs something like 60% I believe
2021-05-08 14:00:24,stocks,"Yes. Explains the drop. Either way, it seems like a great 2-3 year hold."
2021-05-08 12:38:32,stocks,Yeah this is a good point.  IV is somewhat high for this stock right now.   At 56 entry that's great.
2021-05-08 12:28:38,stocks,Bump that up to 400 shares and start selling covered calls
2021-05-08 14:41:23,stocks,">It‚Äôs something like 60% I believe

I doubt it. I recall seeing numbers around \~20 - 25% (still too high). I'm assuming they mention it in their 10K. PLTN has a huge recall going on and it's another reason why AFRM is down. Customers have an option to get a full refund instead of a new/fixed treadmill. I don't think it will affect AFRM long term but short term it's going to hurt their performance."
2021-05-08 12:27:37,stocks,"Right on, I wasn‚Äôt sure I just new it was a high percentage. In all honesty I like AFRM and have used them in the past. Looks like it‚Äôs time to start buying"
2021-05-08 14:25:49,stocks,He can already sell covered calls on the first 300.
2021-05-08 14:27:34,stocks,"Oh I know, but why stop at 375?"
2021-05-08 14:33:10,stocks,"Not sure, probably depends on how much exposure you want in your portfolio."
2021-05-08 00:00:00,stocks,How to buy stocks like Curaleaf? I‚Äôm having difficulty being able to find platforms for certain stocks that are obviously going to take off. Curaleaf is one I think I should throw my money at but what platforms can I purchase it on? Do you have to go to a brokerage firm to get those types of stocks?
2021-05-08 11:48:01,stocks,I bought it on Fidelity
2021-05-08 11:47:11,stocks,"Can't really test out buying, it being the weekend and all, but it at least shows up just fine when searched on Fidelity. CURLF.

Also consider the MSOS ETF if you want exposure to US cannabis. Curaleaf is a big part of it."
2021-05-08 12:16:24,stocks,Uplisting is going to be a nice catalyst for CURLF.
2021-05-08 12:36:27,stocks,Schwab and Fidelity are the best. No OTC fees.
2021-05-08 12:11:20,stocks,Bought on Schwab. Any of the otc cannabis stocks

2021-05-08 14:55:33,stocks,"I have TD Ameritrade who allows it but charges $6.95 a trade for OTC (where curaleaf and other Multi State Operators (MSOs) trade).

2021-05-08 12:01:41,stocks,"Fidelity let you 

Merrill and RH don't

Others I'm not sure"
2021-05-08 12:09:05,stocks,"You can buy all the US weed companies on TD Ameritrade, they are OTC/pink sheet so there is a 6.99 fee per transaction (not a huge deal). Curaleaf, Cresco Labs, Green Thumb Industries, Columbia Care, Jushi...they are all good companies in their own regards. The hope is that they eventually get uplisted to the NASDAQ, maybe with the SAFE banking act. As someone mentioned, the MSOS etf is an easy way to get exposure to many of them, it also holds a lot of other stuff as well though.

2021-05-08 00:00:00,stocks,"Stock certificates A guy who is like a second dad to me lost his wife recently.  While going through her paperwork, he came across some old stock certificates from Arden Farms dated 1957.  I know it was a big dairy company in the 50s and 60s.  I did a quick Google search for him and couldn't find anything, so I thought I'd ask here to see if anyone knew if they had any value or if there were free resources for us to look into it.  Googling Arden Farms came up with several links that I don't think apply to these certificates at all.  This was based in California, but I don't know much more than that.  Any help will be greatly appreciated.  He's in his mid 80s and overwhelmed with everything right now, so I'm just trying to help where I can.

I \*think\* it may have become The Arden Group, trading under ARDNA on NASDAQ, but I could be completely wrong about that.  If so, I would need to figure out how many shares the original certificates are now worth for him.  I don't have them in front of me, but I believe the certificates added up to approx 40 shares back in 1957."

Looks like the Arden Group split 4:1 once, but the hard part is going to be if your shares became Arden group or were part of a buyout or something similar. I don't think Arden farms became Arden group one for one, looks like it was a bunch of mergers and such. You could be left with cash, shares of the new group, or a mixture of both."
2021-05-08 19:43:55,stocks,"Edit:  just spoke with him again and it‚Äôs a total of 100 shares over 4 different certificates. We will try to find a broker who can help figure it all out this coming week.

2021-05-08 12:21:51,stocks,"If he wanted to put them into a Fidelity or Schwab account, or something like that, would he send the certificates to them?  Obviously, we don't have a clue.

2021-05-08 13:01:42,stocks,Didn't even think about contacting the company directly.  Thanks for that suggestion.
2021-05-08 13:03:18,stocks,"The lowest estimate I can come up with is $20k. But that's assuming they became Arden group shares 1:1 with no splits or dividends until 96.

If anything else happened, or they had different terms during a merger or acquisition, it could be different.

You could also try calling the state to see if you have unclaimed dividends."
2021-05-08 13:13:49,stocks,"If the stocks were in her name, would he have a right to those dividends (if there are any, obviously)?  They didn't marry until almost 40 years after those certificates were issued.  For all I know, they're like bearer bonds and whoever is holding them gets the assets."

Personally I despise Facebook and everything they stand for/do. I would never put my money in it eventhough the company will most likely remain to see significant growth for the foreseeable future. Plenty of big tech companies have questionable ethics to put it lightly but for most of them I can see their value to the world and society. Facebook however adds nothing, everything it touches seems to turn to shit.

Are you invested? Do you care about the practices of the company or do prioritize growth?

I'm trying to form an idea of how this stock will perform over the next 20 years when the old garde of investors starts to disappear and be replaced by the new.

Edit: it doesn't matter to me if you have your money in FB and I judge no one for their decision. We are (mostly) regular people trying to make money, if you see an opportunity you should take it.

I still use FB as it‚Äôs a great tool for networking, especially in the music community where people post and obtain info about upcoming performances. Additionally, the video chat aspect of FB is really good too as well as the marketplace. My friends and I hardly post anything on the platform anymore because it‚Äôs become such a garbage heap of human communication. Additionally, I personally don‚Äôt use FB on my mobile devices anymore. I log in on my PC once a day, check to see what‚Äôs up, and peace out. Additionally, with the limitations being placed on tracking by Apple, I think we are going to see a further shift in the way the platform is used. If a less volatile social networking platform were to come to the forefront, I would expect that to amplify this shift.

Playing devils advocate, facebook financially supports to some degree free internet for over 500m people. Why do you hate that? Facebook also uses their profits to build new cables to create a more robust Internet, is this also despicable? 

In many countries that still don‚Äôt have unlimited Messaging or there‚Äôs a WiFi but no cell phone service, applications like fb messenger and WhatsApp can hold together communities. Especially in the developing world.

* Whatsapp was bought out and immediately got it's main appeal (security and encryption) compromised, so  facebook could sell your data.

* SpaceX is providing internet in places that previously had little to no acces to it with Starlink. And the expansion of the internet into poorer areas was bound to happen regardless.

* Oculus was doing groundbreaking work in the space of virtual reality and are arguably the ones that got the current VR boom started. After being bought out by Facebook, costumers couldn't use their devices without a facebook account (despite being promised this wouldn't happen) so they can collect your data and sell it (on a paid device!). Positive public perception of the brand has decreased significantly, there are plenty of serious competitors out there who do not treat their paying costumers like a product. And seeing that 96% of people on IOS devices have opted out of datatracking when given the choice I can't help but see the trajectory of Oculus going down as people do seem to see this as an issue.

* Plenty of e-commerce platform already exist but they get crushed under facebooks enormous weight.

* The reason they build cables is so more people would use facebook and they can turn their users into products. For the benefit of their real costumers, advertisers.

* Facebook has done more to drive communities apart than it has to connect them. There's a direct correlation between the increase of social media and the increase of extremism, conspiracy theories and general missinformation (think anti-vax for example)

* Instagram/facebook has done more harm to the mental health of children than anything we've ever known. The world would be better without this type of social media

Most of the things they do as a company comes with a M A S S I V E  flipside. Everything they do serves ultimately one purpose and one purpose only, harvesting your data. 

I stand by my point, Facebook adds nothing (positive) to the world that wouldn't already exist without them. Except for maybe the ability for small buisnesses to advertise but I would honestly be surprised if a different type of service wouldn't have popped up. And again this only exist so they can monitor your buying behaviour and sell it to other advertisers"

2021-05-08 00:00:00,stocks,"Rebalancing? Long-term strategy Hi all,

I hope I will get some critical feedback on my question on rebalancing:

I don¬¥t wanna write an essay here so I will try to make this quick:

1) I am a super long-term investor 

2) I have around 95% of my money in stocks/crypto

3) I automatically put a lot of money in stocks every month and will continue to do so. Most of the money goes into Tesla, Nasdaq100 and additionally into the individual big tech firms, Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook & Co and some broader, more global ETFs 

Right now I have quite a lot of money (also from one-time investments) in Nasdaq100 and individual stocks like Apple, Amazon & Co. I pretty much see them as my cash equivalent, but I also see them getting bigger and bigger. That¬¥s why I invest into them on a monthly basis.

However, since right now in the current market, high growth potential stocks are getting hammered I see a lot of potential in investing into them, since I see a lot more potential, since fundamentally I think almost nothing has changed but only becuase of markoeconomical reasons, they are getting slaughtered.

Since I don¬¥t have any cash, my idea was to rebalance a little bit.

E.g. Sell Amazon/Apple and buy Teladoc 

I don¬¥t want to argue about Teladoc here, it¬¥s just an example.

In my opinion, Teladoc has a very bright future, it has really good fundamentals, high growth curve and will (again in my opinion) exponentially grow in the next years/decades.

Since e.g. Teladoc is down by 50% from ATH, what do you think about that?

I know, that evaluations in generall with these high growth companies were pretty high (also because of all the FED money pumped into the markets), but a decrease by 50% in that short of a time just seems crazy to me, especially because I think its only happening because of the overall market and not because of fundamentals of that individual company."

Or they had tons of hype dumped into them, they shot up which attracted more people, and now we‚Äôre seeing them fall down to reasonable levels. 


> Since I don¬¥t have any cash, my idea was to rebalance a little bit.


If it‚Äôs done correctly then it can pay off. However the point of rebalancing is to reduce volatility/risk, not to increase gains. You‚Äôre in individual stocks and crypto...that‚Äôs about as risky as it gets and now you‚Äôre wanting to add speculative high growth stocks? Yikes. I‚Äôd step back and figure out why you‚Äôre doing what you‚Äôre doing.

This entire comment isn‚Äôt financial advice....I think it would be better to sell Tesla and buy VTI or VOO.

You don‚Äôt want to argue about teladoc...but then give bad reasons on why you should buy it. 


IMO. There‚Äôs typically reasons why stocks fall 50%. That isn‚Äôt normal for stocks to fall 50% for no reason. You‚Äôre missing information and I think it would be wise to avoid such stocks you don‚Äôt understand.

This right here shows your lack of knowledge. TDOC is not profitable, management has said growth in the company will be very little in 2021, and by some analysts they might experience negative growth. I think it was their Q1 results, analysts set a target of -$0.50 a share and TDOC ended up with -$1.30 something. In other words they lost a lot of money. You‚Äôre also forgetting that TDOC operates in a space with no business moat, what‚Äôs stopping a competitor from doing the same thing they‚Äôre doing? I‚Äôll give you a hint, there are bigger competitors starting to enter the telehealth space. Also what‚Äôs stopping doctor‚Äôs offices from providing their own teladoc like services for cheaper?


Edit: Honestly. To me it seems like you‚Äôre wanting to trim your flowers to plant weeds. You‚Äôre better off ‚Äúrebalancing‚Äù to VTI or VOO imo."

2021-05-08 10:59:44,stocks,"Am I reading correctly that the vast majority of your stock holdings are in tech stocks? For rebalancing purposes, I‚Äôd be looking to move some of that tech into other sectors. I don‚Äôt disagree on the growth potential, however, certain sectors of the market fluctuate at different intervals than others. Having a more diversified portfolio will ensure you have some holdings that are still doing well when one or more other sectors are in a correction/slump. I think you also miss out on growth that can be had in some other sectors as well, for the same reason. I follow the same principal you do in terms of buying and holding very long-term, however, I have a much broader mix of stocks, mutual funds, ETFs, and a small amount of bonds. A case where this diversification came in handy was when I purchased a vacation home using a line of credit on my portfolio. I was able to then sell off some of my stocks that were at their peak, leaving the others to rebound at a later time. The line of credit was just a temporary 1-2 month draw to pay cash on the property while I took the time to work through what I was going to sell to pay off the credit."

Having 95% of your cash in crypto and tech stocks is an easy way to go broke if the market goes tits up, especially say if you need money for an emergency.

As a note, most financial advisors only recommend having up to 5% of your net worth in individual stocks. Some don‚Äôt recommend it at all. Digest this. It really shows how unsound your current strategy is."

2021-05-08 00:00:00,stocks,"LMND - an over valued insurance stock pretending to be a tech stock? I got caught up in LMND during the January hype and I now I'm a bag holder. It's made me look at LMND in more detail and really dissect their financials. Below is a short DD on LMND looking at their 10K annual report in preparation for their Q1 report coming out on Monday.

https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001691421/7d400e55-689a-4fc1-9a55-28ce9601dc6e.pdf

To begin, LMND is an insurance provider that is looking to disrupt the insurance marketplace using AI to handle claims and drive high customer support.

LMND is currently trading at MktCap of 5B with a P/S multiple of 52. Compared to other incumbents in the pure insurance industry:

ALL: P/S - 0.89, MC - 40B

PGR: P/S - 1.39, MC - 62B

TRV: P/S - 1.26, MC - 40B

So obviously LMND is trading at a multiple that treats it more like a tech company than an insurance company. But lots of companies want to be valued at a multiple of a tech company vs insurance company, so lets dig deeper.

LMND made 94BM in revenue in 2020 with a YoY growth of 40%. In their earnings call in March, they stated that they expect greater growth slowdown in 2021...so there's definitely reason to be cautious here given that their mkt cap multiplier is totally based on growth projections.

Here's the troubling part of LMND. Even though their revenue is growing aggressively, their net losses are stacking up too. In 2019 they had net loss of 108M on 67M of revenue, and in 2020 they had net loss of 120M in 94M of revenue. So though their net losses aren't growing at the same rate as their revenue, they're definitely not closing the gap at a great rate. The biggest contribution to their net losses is G&A and technology development. G&A can't be helped as I assume they went on a hiring blitz in 2020. But their investment in ""technology development"" increased 98% from 9.8B to 19.4B. 

While G&A is straight forward as employee compensation, Technology Development is listed as follows:

Technology development - Technology development consists of employee compensation, including stock-based compensation and benefits, and expenses related to vendors engaged in product management, design, development and testing of the Company's websites and products. Technology development also includes allocated occupancy costs and related overhead based on headcount.

Pretty abstract stuff...

Okay, so lets make some projections. The simplest projections is that we're seeing a big shift in the tech market place as a bear market has taken hold the past 3 months. May doesn't look any better, but many of these high flying ""tech stocks"" are now seeing a reduction in multiple. Even if LMND could grow their revenue by 200% this year, if the market starts valuing them like an insurance company and not a tech company (a la RKT), we'll see LMND's price tank into the mid 20's and maybe even lower.

The second projection is if we look at growth of revenue. In their Q4, Lemonade said they are seeing slowdown in a key growth metric:

https://news.futunn.com/en/post/8971338?level=1&data_ticket=1620471675650956

The stock tanked to $113 from $132, and has been on a slide since then, influenced by general tech stock malaise. Even at its current price of $79 it seems over valued in some regards.

Here are the key metrics to look for. LMND is projecting revenue in Q1 to be 22M. That would set it on base to make about $100M in CY2021. Which isn't spectacular growth to justify its valuation, as it slows the growth rate down to 10% YoY.

Overall, LMND stock looks really dicey at the moment. Given this information, I'm probably going to unload half my bags before earnings and see what the news is. If the news is good, then I'll hold the other half and hope to reduce my losses. Otherwise, I plan to immediately unload the remaining half if the growth numbers look bad since this will ensure another 3 month slide in price. If growth numbers are bad, expect LMND to fall below their IPO price.

LMND did an offering at $165/share in January. I feel real bad for anyone who has their cost average that high, because looking at their financial statements and projections, LMND doesn't look like they'll get back up there in 2021.



Last note, I think LMND is aiming for an AI holy grail to do their real disruption. They're hoping that if they can handle all claims using AI (of which, currently AI Jim, their claims AI, handles 95% of all claims), they may be able to drive down their costs of doing business so aggressively that their margins become industry leading. Company's like ALL, TRV and PGR have demonstrated that they are too large and bureaucratic to offer solutions like this. So right now, this is the only saving grace of LMND imho.

2021-05-08 10:57:50,stocks,"Thanks for the write up. Reading that was the most time I‚Äôve spent looking at this company. I also know nothing about the insurance business so I go on gut feelings.  

TBH renters & pet insurance are probably the only things I would ever use them for because of the simplicity of signing up.   But I no longer rent and wouldn‚Äôt bother signing up since they don‚Äôt offer auto/boat/etc.  (auto doesn‚Äôt show up on their site so maybe that was an error?).  Getting a customer in with renters and hoping that they eventually jump to homeowners makes sense but it‚Äôs safe to assume the retention would be limited to people that don‚Äôt own vehicles.  I think the niche for them is in the renters market.  Small and minimal claims seem like an easy way to be successful as an app based insurance provider. 

Alright now watch how dumb i am...Renters insurance is a 3.4B market, lots of players in this game and googling puts them at 7th on the list so even if you give them 1/7th of the market it‚Äôs still a rough P/S ratio.  I honestly would not have heard of LMND if it wasn‚Äôt a hot stock for awhile.

But I have no idea what I‚Äôm talking about and just throwing my opinions at it. The last 3 months in the market have pushed me out of speculative stocks and into companies that make money."

2021-05-08 08:32:00,stocks,"The part I can't make heads or tails is what is driving that growth. Are they growing faster than legacy insurance companies because they're a new player that are offering rates that have driven an initial jump in subscribers. Or do they offer something truly unique that is retaining subscribers, driving down costs which they are then passing on to subscribers? I find that most subscribers will just pick the cheapest option?

If you are PGR, ALL or TRV, and you already own 90% of the market, its very hard to grow new customers. If you're a new player, it makes sense you're growing new subscribers faster than the incumbents. But then again, in their shareholder letter for Q4, they said they hit the same number of subscribers as USAA (1M subscribers) in just 4 years whereas it took USAA 47 years. But this doesn't feel like a fair measurement because USAA is restrictive in their model.

For LMND, I would love to see subscriber growth far outstrip the TAM growth. Their current revenue projections don't align to the subscriber growth that justifies their tech company multiplier does it? I'd love to know more if you believe in their growth numbers.

In there Q4 earnings call they said that they hit 1M subscribers with $213 of premium per subscriber: https://s24.q4cdn.com/139015699/files/doc_downloads/2021/Q4-2020-LMND-Shareholder-Letter_vF.pdf

They're projecting 317M in premium for CY2021. This means they expect either 1.7MM customers at premium of $213 per customer (their 2020 rate) or they need to juice their premium per customer to offset their subscriber growth.

Either way, I think the Q1 numbers will set the story for which direction this is going. If they have to increase their premiums, I could see downward pressure as it becomes harder to maintain their customer base. Insurance is a fungible resource, and I don't know if there is as much customer loyalty in insurance as other markets."

2021-05-08 08:37:32,stocks,"Where I'm really getting caught up is behaviour in the insurance industry by subscribers. LMND is betting that they'll be able to gather and retain customers, specifically younger customers, who want a more personalized and streamlined experience in insurance. Focusing on renter, pet and auto insurance, they're trying to create an ecosystem that is leveraging sell through. But at what point does price start to matter? What does LMND need to do to maintain high subscriber growth because they are already seeing it slow down. And if they see it slow down, will they start increasing premium?

Also, insurance is regulated as it requires the underwriters to be able to pay out claims so they can't be over leveraged. Which fundamentally means that margins tend to be low.

The problem I personally made for myself is that I don't know the insurance industry well enough to know how LMND's AI and customer service can overcome macro factors in subscriber behaviour. I should have swung LMND rather than holding it as a conviction purchase."

Then you get into the fact that they dont keep the extra premiums, they give them back to the community in a way that the community votes on.  Which will slow their growth for sure but will also endear a huge amount of people to their company long term. 

All that said I agree with you that it's extremely overvalued right now. I wouldnt touch it for a couple earnings reports more myself probably.

It consistently outperforms it‚Äôs common comparison being the S&P 500 Index.

A 10,000 dollar investment in QQQ on March 31st 2011 would become 61,493 dollars today, compared to 36,756 dollars from the S&P 500 index.

QQQ is considered a riskier ETF than the S&P because of how technology based it is, meaning more of a capital gains ETF where S&P involves more mature companies.

Many people worry about a crash similar to the dot come crash where it took several years for QQQ to recover. If a crash like this happened, is that not a market wide thing? I don‚Äôt see why QQQ would be affected any worse than other stocks that crash.

Personally, I am looking to put extra monthly income in ETFs such as, ARKK, ARKG, VTI, and VXUS along with QQQ and see what that gets me in the next 3-5 years. I just don‚Äôt know at what % to balance each to have a well diversified portfolio. I would like to have QQQ be the largest percentage among these, is there a reason why that is a bad idea? Are there risks involved with QQQ that I have not found? Is now a bad time to get into ETFs and QQQ specifically?

2021-05-08 00:00:00,stocks,Tired of hearing the word ‚Äúundervalued‚Äù I have been hearing this word too often these days. I am so confused what this really means. Will anyone here with better understandings give me few examples of undervalued stocks? I don‚Äôt think most meme stocks ppl mention are undervalued rather they are way overvalued. Please help me understand
2021-05-08 03:34:20,stocks,"I mean, this is probably of no use because it's obvious, but when someone says a stock is undervalued, it means **they think** that the market price of a company is lower than the company is really worth. If someone says they think Apple is undervalued, it is tantamount to saying that Apple is actually worth more than the $2.17 trillion that the market says its worth (for the record, **I** think such a claim would be patently ridiculous). 

It's up to you to figure out how you determine a company's value. A long time ago people relied on tangible assets and cash equivalents against debts to form the base value of a company (sort of like book value), the idea being that the company is worth at least what its owners would get if they decided to close shop and liquidate everything. But this isn't really a great way to value most companies, at least because no company exists with the intention to close shop and liquidate its assets---it would presumably only do so to end an unprofitable enterprise or by force of insolvency. 

The hot-button issue in valuation is obviously how much a company has earned in the past and, especially, **how much you think it will earn in the future**---this is where the most divergence of opinion on value happens, and unfortunately it's also the point where we're the least confident (or, at least, we should be). If a company earns $1 million this year, the market says it's worth $10 million, and you're confident it will earn $100 million a year in 5 years, then you might say that the market is severely undervaluing the company because it's not thinking about the company's potential appropriately. But this is down to what **you** think, and the result comes down to whether or not you were right. Hint: You'll be wrong almost all of the time, because no one can predict the future, and you're no exception to the rule."

Everyone thinks the stocks they're buying are undervalued compared to their long-term prospects or they wouldn't buy them, but that has little relevance on whether or not they are today."

Huge price increases in materials,  they have some shps to avoid some of the higher shipping costs,  and everyone looks at the iron and doesn't notice that they have Nickel and copper too.  On the earnings call they said they were in the early stages of thinking about maybe spinning those off as a separate company so they would be properly valued.   I don't think they will do that,  most likely just trying to advertise that they have them.

That's my pick for undervalued."

Most meme stocks have dog shit fundamentals.

-upcoming earnings report where they are expected to show a healthy amount of growth and profit

On top of that, there is quite some dilution going on right now, so that is causing some selling pressure aswell, which makes it harder to maintain the current SP. People that work for the company have had their shares vested for years, so makes sense that they take some profit now.

If you bought at ATH, the stupidest course of action is to sell in the weeks after as it follows the corridor down. Just let it sit for a year or two or cost average down.

I bought a bunch shortly after the IPO, then more after the ATH, hoping it wouldn't trade down so consistently. Not doing too many options with ""new"" companies though. Personal rule."

They are my current main plays, and I do detailed DD at 4% or if I see myself increasing my holding to 4%, and are long term hold.

&#x200B;

Feedback / questions / comments welcome. Happy to go into more detail, but for now have just done a very brief rationale for my positions:

&#x200B;

**¬£ Hollywood Bowl:** 8.35%. Love this company, branding, numbers (pre-Covid), great management, solid track record and steady growth (also pre-Covid).

**$ Microsoft:** 6.00%. It's just a great company doing well. Diverse, growing, and hungry. It's a growth and divi growth play.

**$ BMY:** 5.36%. Obviously disappointing results, but the treatments they have I believe will recover, plus solid looking pipeline at fairly advanced stages.

**$ AT&T:** 4.67%. I'm bullish and like what I see, from wireless to HBO. I work in backend telco systems and I delved into the Jan QTR end figures for their wireless division and loved what I saw, so increased my holding materially before the latest very impressive results.

**$ EPD:** 4.56%. Defensive and divi, feels undervalued, I like that it has a significant pipeline network built, port and storage infrastructure, significant LNG exposure, and had pretty robust results consider 2020 (commodity prices, Texan weather and Covid dampening demand.

**¬£ Games Workshop:** 4.52%. Crazy margins, great CEO / management, expansion possibilities, lore on point. It's up 23x over 5 years with divi reinvested, 18x without, it's a beast that'll be in the FTSE100 end of 2023, likely sooner.

**¬£ Sage Group:** 4.23%. Bit un-noticed but does HR / payroll / finance and is geographically well diversified and under loved. Legacy tech but I like it, divi and buybacks. I generally feel CRM systems (Salesforce most notable) get all the attention because obviously they're meant to drive sales, but other internal systems matter and are in desperate need of modernisation. (If you want a sexier but higher risk play if you accept this logic, consider Workday).

**¬£ Fevertree Drinks:** 3.8%. Convinced this company will be a monster, and maybe the next Monster. Originally a tonic specialist for Gin, it's targeting both international and other mixers for expansion. Market hugely over-reacted to decent results considering Covid, and I opened a sizeable position.

**$ CACI International:** 3.77%. Also a bit unnoticed, it's a software meets military intelligence and Gov IT company. No divi, and they are quite clear they have no intention of it (literally a Buffett approach, we can use the money better than you.. :)), but winning contracts and very deeply ingrained with US Gov / military.

**$ HBAN**: 3.76%. Regional US bank digesting an acquisition. I like the direction. Recent numbers were so-so and dipped to $14.50, which is was a chance for me to add 80% to my previous holding.

**$ HUN:** 3.2%. Funny story here, I found this by accident when HBAN dipped to $14.50 as was looking for data to understand that drop and put in ""Hunt"" for Huntington Bancshares (HBAN) and accidently went to Huntsman Corporation (HUN). Lucky for me I guess, as I was curious and liked what I saw. I was frantically buying under $28, and although the shares shot up following good results and a 15% divi increase, I still like it. I see nobody talking about them,  but they have made significant changes to their business over the last couple of years, so although revenue is falling, earnings are looking great. It's become a leaner business with a war chest for suitable acquisitions, seems undervalued and has a respectable and now fast growing divi."
2021-05-08 03:15:42,stocks,Why would you have 43 companies?  That‚Äôs diworseification right there.  Anything passed 30 has been proven to have no affect on safety in diversity.  How can you ever add to your 41st 42nd or 43rd company when you have more conviction in your top 10?  These are criticisms that come directly from Buffet and Peter Lynch.

I would rank them by conviction and sell off the bottom few to increase holdings in the top ideas to be more efficient and increase your chance of outsized returns.  It's hard to pick a good investment and each one you pick statistically drives you closer to the mean. Diversification = dilution.

I think I‚Äôm beating a dead horse here but 43 is a hell of a lot of stocks to hold and or keep track of. 

Also you should be doing detailed DD on all your holdings.....this is why most people hold 15 or less. Charlie Munger held onto 5 I believe when he made his money. He‚Äôs also the guy that coined the term ‚Äúdeworseification.‚Äù Meaning you‚Äôre diversifying but making your portfolio worse. In reality you will only ever find 5-10 good stocks in your lifetime and you may only get 1 or 2 chances to make a lot of money on them.

Dividends are irrelevant to the investor. There‚Äôs no logical basis for an investor to prefer cash from a dividend over cash from selling shares.

As a 40K fan, I'm mixed with Games Workshop's long-term aspects. Here's my bear case:

\- 3D Printing: This is the big disruptor in GW's retail arm. Each year, 3D printing gets cheaper, more accessible, and better quality control. There's already steady cottage market of commissioning models online, and it's not a big step to release those model files for free online. GW has been silent or mildly hostile private 3D printing. I give them a year or two before they have to deal with that bugbear.

\- Brand Dilution: GW's branding has been overall better then it's competitors, with Hasbro (Magic the Gathering, Dungeons & Dragons) having overall better managed branding then GW. GW has books tie-in, IP licensing for videogames, and been playing with other ventures like collectibles. The hurdle for GW is dilution, as GW is willing to pull pieces of IP apart and give them to developers to play with, with little regard to quality control. This gets you duds like 40K Space Hulk: Deathwing or 40K: Regicide, or failing to keep up quality for well regarded series like 40K: Dawn of War."

Diversity doesn‚Äôt come from the number of stocks as much as it does from exposure to different sectors and macroeconomic factors. An ETF like ARKK has plenty of stocks, but is very undiversified because  they‚Äôre all high beta stocks which rely on continued speculation and low interest rates.

Boring is a good thing. Boring means there is no emotional investment and seemingly no time to invest.

(All)World ETFs are the most boring shit ever, but will outperform the majority of stock pickers without investing any valueable time whatsoever meaning you can actually invest the time in meaningful ways instead of watching charts and pick stocks."
2021-05-08 15:16:57,stocks,"I recognise 43 is too many, I'm fairly new to investing (6 months) and got carried away. I initially had 78 and small holdings in many, and am consistently pruning that back. I expect to get under 25 in the next year. But these 11 companies I love enough that I want them to be long term holds. To be fair to myself, I asked for thoughts on the 11, not the other 30+ I still have work to do on. 

&#x200B;

Regarding Games Workshop, although ofc past performance isn't a reflection of future performance, part of the reason why this company has accelerated since 2015 is that they made significant changes to their operating model, they overhauled their internal systems, changed relationships with suppliers and retailers, etc. That good work still sets them apart from many companies, and will continue to have a material benefit for their business. To ignore that doesn't seem right either. I do not expect a further 23x, to be clear. No reasons? Great margin, great management team, good expansion, good product - ""lore on point"", were all mentioned. I suppose I could have added the above but as per my intro, and gone into details about the fan base, but it's a brief summary on each, not a page essay on each.

Regarding dividends, data suggests that divi stocks outperform non-divi stocks, with the former averaging 9.17% return against 4.18% for stocks that didn't pay a divi: [https://advisor.morganstanley.com/christopher.f.poch/documents/field/p/po/poch-christopher-francis/WhyDividendsMatter.pdf](https://advisor.morganstanley.com/christopher.f.poch/documents/field/p/po/poch-christopher-francis/WhyDividendsMatter.pdf). 

This article makes the same point with different data / date periods. [https://www.simplysafedividends.com/intelligent-income/posts/36-5-reasons-to-be-a-dividend-growth-investor](https://www.simplysafedividends.com/intelligent-income/posts/36-5-reasons-to-be-a-dividend-growth-investor).

I did start at 78 and clearly made some mistakes. Since then (Nov 2020) I've been cutting back and hope to eventually have <20 over-all. 

These 11, totaling 52%, is my starting point, and the stuff I personally feel strongly about at this stage, having what I consider good reasons to have these holdings for the long term :)"

It‚Äôs true that ARK stocks are mostly getting crushed in unison right now. It‚Äôs also true that her brand of picks surge together when the market inspires confidence. Given that she speaks consistently about a 5 year time horizon, I have these questions for you: 

1. Do you suppose that growing companies whose stocks are poorly valued at the moment, will be unlikely to improve their valuations? 

2. Do you believe the nervousness in the market now will persist for most of the next five years, preventing surges in Woods‚Äô picks?

3. Does it seem possible that Woods is forecasting business growth -> improved valuation taking place during this rotation and possible upcoming deceleration of the economy, thereby setting up explosive growth when the market rotates again in the future? 

Again, just asking for the sake of conversation. I have 0 overlap with ARK."

If you want diversification then just by an index rather than buying a large collection of companies. There is no point in owning 43 companies... just stick with your high conviction picks then buy an index or ETF with an allocation to hedge the risk."

Smh. You‚Äôre misrepresenting the information or at the very least misunderstanding it. You have a lot to learn. Since you‚Äôre new I‚Äôll offer some help. 


While dividend growth stocks have beaten the market. It is silly to suggest it‚Äôs due to their dividend policy. It‚Äôs often due to other factors that can explain their out performance. Even the article you citied said at the end: 


> We believe dividend investing, **under the framework of stocks with conservative but meaningful payout ratios and yields** ‚Äì with strong track records and future prospects of rising payouts ‚Äì offers potential value in an environment where many assets are at or above fair value. **Low interest rates, strong corporate balance sheets, and investor demand should help this trend continue.**


 In other words: companies with high cash flow, low debt, fast revenue growth, etc are good stocks to pick which would be true regardless of the presence of a dividend. 


As for dividends being irrelevant I‚Äôd suggest you read Dividend Policy, Growth, and the Valuation of Shares (1961). This states that as long as $1=$1 there is no logical basis for an investor to prefer cash from dividends over cash from selling shares. This is due to the fact cash from a dividend is not free and is infact taken out of the balance sheet from the company to which is reflected in the share price on the Ex-Date when the share price drops by the amount of the dividend. 


https://www.jstor.org/stable/2351143?seq=1


I‚Äôd also recommend you read Warren Buffett‚Äôs 2012 Letter to Shareholders where he explains why you can in fact be worse off with a dividend policy in place. 


https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/2012ltr.pdf


And then if you want it broken down in an easy to understand video. This guy is Ben Felix, he‚Äôs a portfolio manager at PWL Capital. He cities research papers which you can read for yourself.

I'll start off by saying that I'm not looking for recommendations for ETFs that have high percentage holdings of these two stocks, I've got a high conviction in these two stocks specifically. However, aside from around their earnings, they've generally moved pretty well in tandem. And so I'm wondering if I would be better off just picking one of the two instead of splitting money between them"
2021-05-07 23:19:16,stocks,"I would personally hold both. They should move together over time as they continue to grow, but say you go all in on one and they end up having some legal issues or something else negative comes up that affects the company, you will be protected against a sell-off as well as already have stock in the other company for when/if they pick up the market share."
2021-05-07 23:55:09,stocks,I was thinking about this and I believe SQ can outpace PYPL with its direct crypto investments and the potential of still expanding its business and reaching Europe (UK right now) and other countries.

Square is more volatile. I like it's potential long term a hell of a lot more and it's a really underrated reopening stock particularly w COVID and it's easy accessibility and use.

I'd pick both up. But wait for a time when tech is having a bad day which seems to be more often than not nowadays.."

For example, with 70k in hand, you can buy FB stock and sell 2 June 18 $325 calls and collect $1,700."

It's also another way to cut losses for a premium instead of being a bagholder.

2021-05-07 23:23:07,stocks,That extremely low profit and the point of covered calls for me is lowering my risk and providing ‚Äúguaranteed‚Äù income since I can sell the security if it goes below strike.

2021-05-08 07:46:29,stocks,"I don‚Äôt really agree with that at all. You own shares of stock because you are hoping it goes up and sell you covered calls to hedge your bet. If the stock goes up you still make money. Yeah if you want to yolo on a stock that you think can go up more then 20% then go ahead but that‚Äôs gambling. 
            I don‚Äôt know I just think selling covered calls is smart and safe easy money if you pick the right security"
2021-05-08 11:24:42,stocks,Clov is where I‚Äôm in Rn.
2021-05-08 00:59:12,stocks,Same. If I don‚Äôt manage to sell off a stock when it drops below strike on time I‚Äôll hang onto it and just sell anther cover for the stock the next expiration
2021-05-08 12:50:22,stocks,"At the most basic level you‚Äôre selling a call against the shares you own. Realistically, the goal is to pick a strike price where you don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll hit before expiration so you keep the premium and keep the shares so you can turn around and do it again.

Worst case is that you collect the premium, the call gets exercised and you have to sell them for the strike price.

Ex: I have 500 BAC shares I bought at $22.50 last March during the COVID tanking. Recently I was going to liquidate some of them to diversify elsewhere but decided just to sell calls against a couple hundred of the shares. Figured I would collect the premium and if they for exercised I was fine with it since I wanted to sell some anyway and I would have made a good profit on them.

What you‚Äôll also find is that the more volatile the stock the higher the premium usually. So BAC‚Äôs premium wasn‚Äôt bad. Better than, for example, T, but definitely not rolling in the dough on the premiums."

""It seems that in the United States, at least, app developers and advertisers who rely on targeted mobile advertising for revenue are seeing their worst fears realized: Analytics data published this week suggests that US users choose to opt out of tracking 96 percent of the time in the wake of iOS 14.5.

When Apple released iOS 14.5 late last month, it began enforcing a policy called App Tracking Transparency. iPhone, iPad, and Apple TV apps are now required to request users' permission to use techniques like IDFA (ID for Advertisers) to track those users' activity across multiple apps for data collection and ad targeting purposes.

The change met fierce resistance from companies like Facebook, whose market advantages and revenue streams are built on leveraging users' data to target the most effective ads at those users. Facebook went so far as to take out full-page newspaper ads claiming that the change would not just hurt Facebook but would destroy small businesses around the world. Shortly after, Apple CEO Tim Cook attended a data privacy conference and delivered a speech that harshly criticized Facebook's business model.

Nonetheless, Facebook and others have complied with Apple's new rule to avoid being rejected from the iPhone's App Store, though some apps present a screen explaining why users should opt in before the Apple-mandated prompt to opt in or out appears.""

2021-05-08 10:39:14,stocks,I'm an android user and This is one of the main reasons i will probably buy an iphone over an android phone for my next device.
2021-05-08 12:00:52,stocks,Why haven‚Äôt I seen a single prompt asking me to opt out?
2021-05-08 12:09:14,stocks,"That's ok. Front end user tracking via cookies is the old way of doing things. All this is now being done in the back end without anyone even knowing its happening.

2021-05-08 16:09:39,stocks,"Good. This is how the free market should work. 

Since we don‚Äôt have a right to privacy, I want a company to honor the precedent of asking me what I prefer as far as data sharing and  targeted marketing. It will build trust and loyalty on a consumer level, and ensure long term patronage."
2021-05-08 18:16:44,stocks,ITS FUCKING ABUSE!!!!!!!
2021-05-08 19:54:20,stocks,"I'm about as anti-apple as you can be, but this is I admire them for. I hope other companies adopt a similar policy."
2021-05-07 23:47:56,stocks,Next step is to get search engines to stop tracking what we are searching online‚Ä¶. It‚Äôs pretty annoying when a single search and we are bombarded with a weeks worth of ads‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm ok with it being a collective search data as a whole. But not at a individual level.
2021-05-08 02:04:40,stocks,This may finally persuade me to switch to Apple after using Android for the past  15 years.
2021-05-08 04:20:53,stocks,"I was a long time Android person, but switched to iPhone recently because of their stance on privacy. Apple is picking the right side of this fight. People are sick of being treated like a commodity."
2021-05-07 22:14:24,stocks,Nonetheless - I'm still a bull on FB (I own).  As analysts have noted this 'handicaps' all advertisers equally... so why not stick with the horse that has a proven 1-Billion+ eyes.
2021-05-08 08:57:42,stocks,"Great, so now we still have ads, but less personalized, and the truth is, Apple are just trying to maximize their power and control over everybody, including small businesses, who are already struggling during the pandemic.... sounds awesome"
2021-05-08 06:39:00,stocks,Samsung has been pushing me away for years now. I was thinking to get a different android but Apple is starting to sound more and more appealing.
2021-05-08 07:30:42,stocks,I don‚Äôt even hate targeted advertising. I opted out just to spite Facebook.
2021-05-08 09:31:30,stocks,Such a scummy money making tactic anyway. Hope anyone involved in tracking data gets burnt.
2021-05-07 23:56:36,stocks,I once had a conversation with my wife on the phone and 30 minutes later I got a text message from an odd number that was a perfect transcript of what I said to her....I had heard stories of this before and thought the person was crazy ironically it was like 2 weeks before the transcript incident.
2021-05-08 03:33:10,stocks,"Fuck, I make a living from advertising."
2021-05-07 23:58:52,stocks,I fail to believe that companies who have infinite resources don‚Äôt know that literally every human doesn‚Äôt give half a shit about whether their ads are targeted... this is no surprise
2021-05-08 09:47:01,stocks," Do not be fooled! 
Apple hasn‚Äôt mysteriously become altruistic. 
Do you think the same company that forces their own devices into obsolescence so you can buy more on a yearly basis is in your corner? Devices mind you that are made with rare earth metals and questionable labor. 
No no no. This is competitive- not charitable-behavior. They have not disallowed tracking on their own App Store and within the iOS platform. 
Facebook played this so badly too. 

I‚Äôve spent actually HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS of dollars on FB ad spend (I‚Äôm a small fish too). Since April of last year, ad inventory has gotten like 5x more expensive. Ads on Facebook get inflated by a lot of factors but the one affecting CPMs (cost per thousand impressions) was VC funded companies that sell things nobody wants. The next was the election. Even with all the sophisticated tracking - people would comment ‚Äúis Facebook reading my mind?‚Äù on our ads every day - ads have already been getting way too expensive. Our performance on ads is unusually good. Still, Facebook has steadily raised the price of ad space. They want you to give them every profit dollar knowing you‚Äôll continue to pay for break-even ‚Äúcustomer acquisition.‚Äù They even say that in their literature  to ad buyers. I‚Äôll search for that link. 

This is actually the perfect smokescreen for Facebook to say, ‚Äúsee it‚Äôs apple hurting your business.‚Äù Facebook serves a warning on the ad console saying something to that effect. Except Facebook sets the CPMs!! This is not some perfect market where there is no centralized influence. Facebook warns me ‚Äúyour ads will be less effective because of... reasons.‚Äù You know what would make ads more effective? LOWER THE COST OF YOUR INCREASINGLY INEFFECTIVE AD SPACE! The iOS14 stuff could not have come at a better time for them. 

I don‚Äôt know why Apple is doing this. Maybe to sell more iPhones? Honestly that seems like the na√Øve explanation. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs something more nefarious. I promise they do not have your best interest in mind. 

You are still going to get ads guys. They will simply be less targeted. Is that good? I don‚Äôt know. If anything the day has been won by VC funded zombies -that only look like businesses but whose charge is to sell their equity not their product. Because they don‚Äôt care if produce a profit on ads. They don‚Äôt care is they ever generate a financial profit. So they spend on ads regardless of return just to drive their topline. So if getting more ads for the next Casper clone sounds good, then you are in luck my friend. 

I support privacy measures. I‚Äôm using them myself on iOS14. I browse with brave when I remember to. The real privacy is not exposing us to marketing images - we all know that Is never happening. 

To put a sharp point on all of this aka TL;DR Apple does not give two turtle shits about your privacy and they actually handed Facebook a badly needed excuse as to why their platform is not performing for advertisers."
2021-05-08 00:00:42,stocks,"I love how they argue that it keeps the service free. It may be true, but not necessarily in the way they imply. If the ad revenue dried up, they could actually offer to pay the users for the ability to track them as a way to bring it back, and that might be a viable business model. We could essentially be cut in on the profits for the ads sold to us. So in other words, enabling ad tracking could be a way to keep the service (information selling) free for them."
2021-05-08 01:22:54,stocks,FB shareholders should be happy. Now advertiser have to spend even more money to get eyeballs on their ads.
2021-05-08 04:20:38,stocks,Wow sucks for them. Anyways‚Ä¶

2021-05-08 07:55:29,stocks,"My opinion on the matter is that the day FB came into the picture, we started to be affected with all sort of social issues within our own country. I think theyre the root of all this divide in politics, in the people, and our infrastructure.   Fuck facebook and twitter hope they get burnt to the ground. This world will be better and start to heal as soon as we get those companies out of here."

It was entertaining to see all these companies crying and essentially begging everyone to let them to keep doing what they‚Äôre doing. Fuck off."
2021-05-08 00:38:16,stocks,"Whoever said we want targeted ads is misinformed. Marketing reaction to this has been ‚Äúyou want better deals on shaving cream .. right .. cause you bought some!?‚Äù 

No . I want zero ads target to my activity. If your platform only exists on the backs of AD revenue then you deserve to shut down or adapt. 

There is no advertisement middle ground, we don‚Äôt want to be sold 24/7/365 !!"
2021-05-08 00:14:51,stocks,"The way forward for Facebook and other players leveraging App tracking will be to pay the users some amount of money to track them.   Surely, they will have to part some of their profits from the users who they are tracking."
2021-05-08 00:19:59,stocks,Brave browser is the future. Check out the BAT project.
2021-05-08 01:47:15,stocks,Oh no but how will I receive personalized ad experiences that are tailored toward my interests as a consumer who exists on a lifestyle rubric dreamed up by some fucking MBA.
2021-05-08 02:49:56,stocks,"Facebook does not have its own smart phone business like Google or Apple. If they do not do anything about it then cash flow will be less and will not be able to invest in future products such as Augmented Reality, they will not not be free to acquire companies, they will not add additional features to their own existing apps.

This is a dick move From Tim Cook towards competition, it looks from the outside Apple is protecting consumers , but in reality the next 10 years will be a total different game , Apple Car, Apple Gaming, Apple AR/V, Apple Music/movies etc, while it may not give the killing blow to competition but at least will slow it down.
If Facebook does not succeed in AR it will disappear."
2021-05-08 03:19:36,stocks,Oh wow people hate being listened too 24/7 and having their info stolen by big companies and stored on a harddrive somewhere to be sold to another big company to bombard you with ads about beds and bidets while they look at dank memes on instagram?

Google I‚Äôm less worried about. Honestly, same with apple. They need my data to make better overall products. Better search engines, better gmail, better hangouts, better Google drive.  Better Siri, better apps and phone settings etc. 

But I think we all know that. I think we all, almost unanimously agree, when we saw this, we all said ‚Äúfuck Facebook and Instagram‚Äù in particular."

I could be wrong on this of course- that's the kind of behavior that would invite anti-trust action being taken against them, but I suspect they feel it's worth the risk."

PAY THE CUSTOMER if they give permission for their AD data to be shared and don't care about ADs i sure dont if they paid me for it i would let them have all the AD data they want!

If you see a pop up for accepting cookies when browsing the web...you're welcome and sorry. When meeting with these companies to discuss how they wanted the implement the software, every company would let their marketing team dictate how it should be run. I mean to the point where legality could be argued. I would literally have to argue with them to help them realize they were wrong and they never wanted accepted the until their legal department got involved and said the exact same thing i would argue.

Each and every company would say in so many words...""We don't want to give the user the option up front or easily. If they have the option to opt out they will without even reading it.""

Take note that functionally or technically tracking and advertising almost never impacts user experience. The rare uses for it could be when content(mostly logins) is shared across platforms for the same user. I do understand that social media is everywhere so it could be seen as a necessary component but why does your local restaurant or car dealer website need to track you for that.

Most other companies, FB, Twitter, Google, provide free to use services first and foremost. They need to make money to keep providing those free services.

2) more subscription based models

3) apps tricking you into sharing data in exchange for premium services

4) Google Play and App Store creating premium stores that don't have ads and allow more access to premium features in apps (features that should have just been included anyways). The app platforms will pay out app creators a small percent."

2021-05-08 01:43:30,stocks,I think Apple might be aiming to replace Facebook as the social media giant that has your real name attached to it.  They setup this privacy fight now and later on down the line they start adding social media features attached to your apple id and start eating into Facebooks market share while it‚Äôs still reeling from trying to make it‚Äôs business profitable again as it loses access to a sizable chunk of it‚Äôs main product.
2021-05-08 02:27:05,stocks,I dog shit on Apple all of the time but I really do have to hand it to these bastards I will probably buy an iPhone instead now just because of this. I really am enjoying how transparent the phone is telling you when apps are doing things. Like a light will turn on to tell you the mic is listening. I have no idea why Apple is doing this for us but I‚Äôm not going to kick a gift horse in the mouth.

2021-05-08 15:04:27,stocks,"If you all want a serious answer I've been a media buyer for a decade and now run an adtech startup. I'm intimately familiar with the space. 

Winners I think will be legacy media companies, Google, and companies that primarily deliver content through mobile apps that require a sign in. (As they have first party data they dont lose as much targeting power) think Spotify, Pandora, YouTube, Hulu, etc.

Losers will most likely be: companies that rely on banner ad sales (mediamath, trade desk, etc). Local publishers, niche blogs, etc. The longtail is going to hurt. Also I would bet shopify takes a beating. The only reason those stores got so popular was on the back of FB ads. 

The death of the cookie is not the death of the ad by a long shot. People will continue to spend more on ads as markets get more competitive. Looks for money to move into sandboxed experiences where they hold first party data (social media), legacy and more intteruptive ads, look for a revival in things like OOH and audio."
2021-05-08 01:23:24,stocks,"Which company as a whole? Facebook --> Twitter --> Google in that order.

2021-05-07 23:40:15,stocks,"I won't say this *isnt* happening right now, but there is another explanation. 

The profiles they build are *scary* accurate. It may *seem* like your phone is listening to you when its off, but the more likely scenario is you're noticing the coincidental moments where you talk about something you're interested in/read about/googled, and you get an ad for it in the same time frame."
2021-05-08 00:41:57,stocks,"> just two of us on the couch talking. Ten minutes later, I pick up my phone and see an ad for the very thing I just mentioned

Facebook doesn't listen to your conversations. It isn't technically feasible and it would be easily detected by anyone with the skills to jailbreak the phone and would be major news. Not only that Apple and Google would be able to detect it and Facebook would be kicked off their platforms so fast. On Apples platform at least if any app is using the microphone in the background you have a red banner on the home screen.

> The next day my wife mentioned an old friend she hadn't heard from in years- also in a private conversation in our house. An hour later, Facebook sent me a friend suggestion for that same person.

Facebook is SCARY good at friend suggestions. If your wife met the friend, they might have known via GPS or noticed using the same wifi hotspot and other clues like mutual friends. They aren't listening to you, though."
2021-05-08 00:04:59,stocks,"Yeah as much as I hate Facebook, they are not listening to your microphone. One thing they do, is show you ads based upon searches from other devices within geographic area or connected to the same wifi. So you and your wife had a conversation about something, then she goes and searches for that thing then you get served an ad for it."
2021-05-08 02:01:04,stocks,"People say they are scared of Facebook listening to them then turn around and use Chrome. Lol 

I‚Äôm just saying, Facebook and other apps don‚Äôt need to listen to you to build a good profile of your behaviour. You volunteer your behaviour by using a browser that tracks your every move, to go on websites that give the data back to Facebook or google. 

It‚Äôs past time we don‚Äôt mention google in the same conversation as we mention Facebook."
2021-05-07 23:50:56,stocks,"Just have more conversations with your wife about killing billionaires, until they get the message."
2021-05-07 23:45:36,stocks,"The thing to know is that everything is connected, your Google searches, your apps, and everything with your digital footprint. While you might think it‚Äôs listening to you and targeting based on this, it most certainly knows enough about you already to make a good guess on Ads that will work for you. There are articles you can find that explain this more in depth."
2021-05-07 23:55:02,stocks,Why do you still have Facebook? Delete that shit
2021-05-08 09:20:29,stocks,Lol. Intrusive? I think that‚Äôs putting it mildly.
2021-05-08 11:48:55,stocks,Sounds like straight up wire tapping since nobody participating in the conversation is giving consent to be overheard.
2021-05-08 12:57:14,stocks,"People out here saying ‚Äúthey don‚Äôt do that, that‚Äôs not how it works‚Äù. Yeah okay sure.

2021-05-08 03:49:29,stocks,They‚Äôre not listening to you. It has been debunked several times before.
2021-05-08 04:56:32,stocks,Only if you are paranoid. everything you do is being monitored. Even your calls on normal phone
2021-05-08 06:03:07,stocks,"The thing is, they can do that without using the microphone. Facebook has ads on a large part of the internet, so they can track which website you visit even if you aren‚Äôt logged on, provided the website has something like a ‚Äúlike this‚Äù Facebook button ‚Äî that shit loads JavaScript code that basically turns on full blast tracking before the button is even shown. Now if Facebook sees that you were nearby x person for say 1h of time (because it tracks your geo positional data when it runs in the background), then it can assume you were probably talking. Now if the person you were with searches anything on google on their phone, then through ad platforms they can guess the fingerprint/person making the request and thus assume you both probably talked about that subject. Guess what you‚Äôll see then? Fucking ads for what the other person you were with googled. Say you talked about a new band you heard on the radio and your friend searches for that band 2-8h after they leave, then good odds are you‚Äôll get ads about that band/item/whatever the next 2-3 days."
2021-05-08 06:13:21,stocks,"This is just confirmation bias, there‚Äôs a much larger number of private conversations you‚Äôve had which they didn‚Äôt show a relevant ad for afterwards, you just only notice the coincidences. Facebook are just very good at profiling people and showing relevant ads, but they‚Äôre not literally using the microphone to record conversations. It would be easy to detect anyway with packet sniffing."
2021-05-08 07:05:57,stocks,"It's also correlation, not causation."
2021-05-08 07:43:37,stocks,You should have deleted FB long ago.  No good can come from that company.
2021-05-08 08:33:44,stocks,I'm having a hard time believing this lol
2021-05-08 08:43:24,stocks,there's no such thing as ads from recording people's conversations. you guys were talking about something you already previously showed some online interest in.
2021-05-08 09:56:53,stocks,Doesn‚Äôt work like that. It‚Äôs purely coincidental and actually based on your actual behavior/interests. But I‚Äôm all for seeing the data that proves otherwise
2021-05-08 10:19:37,stocks,"I've never in my life had this stuff happen to me ^ like what product causes this? I haven't even gone out of my way to avoid it, the only targetted advertising I've ever noticed is Instagram advertising EK products to me after I bought a fuck ton of them and the U.S. military finding out I'm an 18 yo man with a student pilots license and trying to get me to join the air force."
2021-05-08 10:27:09,stocks,The really scary shit is that they aren‚Äôt spying on your conversations. They just already know what you will be talking and thinking about in the next few days.
2021-05-08 10:31:20,stocks,"This implies a falsehood. FB doesn't listen to conversations. Google, Amazon, and Apple do via their home devices, but they've all been very clear that the data is only for analysis of the AI tools, it's not stored long-term, no one can copy it, and it's anonymized. Google has also hinted that it gets chinked so that no one analyst hears more than a sentence or two."
2021-05-08 11:27:07,stocks,"This is just a coincidence. I can guarantee you Facebook is not turning on your mic and listening to what you are saying, unless they ask for permission to do that (which they don't,) they cannot."
2021-05-08 12:43:54,stocks,OK. Seriously. How do they do that? Do they turn on the mics? Someone talks to me about something (over the phone or face to face) and ads show up for something related right after.
2021-05-08 12:50:07,stocks,"Yeah, just because I like basketball doesn't mean I want every FB sponsored page to be some basketball related shit."
2021-05-08 12:57:10,stocks,This has been proven not to happen though
2021-05-08 14:12:39,stocks,"You‚Äôre delusional, sorry.

Facebook is not listening to your active conversations, if you really think that you need to take the tin foil hat off and take your meds."
2021-05-08 14:39:33,stocks,"As others have pointed out, this is with 100% certainty not happening. Nobody has ever been able to prove it - and I‚Äôm sure you understand the fame it would bring to do that. 

On top of that there are so many attack angles if it did exist. Internal documents and employees speaking anonymously, deconstructing apps and phones to test when the mic is activated, checking when information is sent over your router and what that information includes, and more. It is simply impossible that this happens and is undetectable to the smartest and most creative nerds internationally that would love nothing more than to prove a privacy issue as big as this."
2021-05-08 14:43:06,stocks,How does that work? Can you explain. Am I being listened to on my phone?
2021-05-08 15:16:30,stocks,This comment is wildly misleading on an already bad situation
2021-05-07 23:53:52,stocks,"Dude the same happens to me, but with my Samsung Smart TV. My wife and I have a conversation and then a commercial comes up about what we were discussing. At first I thought it was just a coincidence but it‚Äôs happened so frequently, I‚Äôm not so sure anymore."
2021-05-08 01:43:31,stocks,"Yup. Anyone who says it‚Äôs not listening is crazy. Was in the car with my buddy today who happens to bring up a random story about his wife‚Äôs company ordering Hennessy for a party. I‚Äôve never had it, never spoken about it and I don‚Äôt even buy liquor. No less than 20min later on my Instagram I had literally ads for Hennessy."
2021-05-08 00:46:58,stocks,"Dude, WTF? I‚Äôve never, ever noticed that.

2021-05-08 05:31:17,stocks,I love this idea. I also think not having responses filtered based on every other search you've ever made through the same engine will be healthier for society in the long run. If you've clicked ads that support liberal/conservative positions it'll be healthy to not only get links that support your internal biases.

Yes, a cellphone provides data to the mobile provider but it's limited and sometimes anonymous or encrypted. Succinctly, it doesn't provide ALL data. Like driving on the road we know the model of the car, but what you do in the car is unknown.

Marketing data isn't just marketing. It's you, your data. Does a weather app needs to know everything about you? No. But the harvest has been going on.

That means bad actors can use the data. Such as maybe you love Rubber Ducks. So you see alot of Rubber Duck content, you engage. Later you see articles about the shortage of Rubber Ducks. Then the harmful effects of Rubber Ducks. Then Rubber Chicken lovers are trying to takeover Rubber Ducks. You move from passion, to doubt, to fear, to anger, to movement. This is a simple example.

Marketing Data doesn't mean it has to be used for marketing.

You can opt for personalise ads by giving the data you want to give. Doesn't mean FB needs to harvest everything including your political affiliates, sexual preferences, alternative diets, etc. The D&D brand can target you based on what you like and do (Contextual Targeting). No need to know ALL about you."

But given that America likely thinks its citizens have no right to privacy online given that the basis for the internet was started by the American Government and they then systematically spied on every American and non-American on the planet, it‚Äôs not at all surprising Americans have to rely upon other governments and corporations to start the ball rolling."

2021-05-08 00:59:32,stocks,"*Actually*, this is **exactly** what should be happening 100% of the time. Every time the government steps in to fix stupidity among companies, the people pay for it in the end.

Comics were under attack for lack of regulations; Congress threatens to step in; Comics Code Authority (CCA) is created as a response.

Movies under attack for lack of regulation; Congress threatens to step in; Motion Picture Association (MPA) is created as a response.

Games are under attack for lack of regulation; Congress threatens to step in; Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) is created as a response.

An example of a bad outcome, is what's happened lately with the FTC in regards to online content. DC establishes basic rules to keep everyone in check, yet, runs into problems when the environment changes. This inevitably leads into a ton of friction, and loads of work that most people would rather not deal with.

And, just about any monopoly requires government approval, and as a result, you begin to run into quality control issues that can be easily overlooked by the government. Apple ran up against the monopoly issue, but, because they're attempting to keep their market share, they're finding ways around it (as they should, per capitalist standards), and are now exploring new avenues towards this goal.

Not to mention, that Apple's currently under lawsuit from Epic for anti-competitive issues, what's to say they're not looking at this and realizing they really do need to fix things to avoid an anti-trust audit?

So, the fact that Apple's even doing this, I rather like, cause, they're actually being smart about it. Of course, consumers and such should keep an eye on them, to avoid the quality issues towards them.

Apple COULD, and probably does to some degree, use data harvesting to sell you more product, BUT you think that iPhone screen couldn't push you adds? Or iTunes push adds in thr middle of your Playlist? 

They don't have to do this and piss off their customers because they have so many, and so much market share they don't give a crap about bad faith profit practice specifically geared against their customers best interests(at least in this instance, they have plenty of production based bad faith profit practice). 

Facebook, yes they provide a free service, but the service they provide you for free earns them a shit ton of money buy selling YOU... that's right  they only produce one thing. Data on you.

YOU ARE NOT FBs CUSTOMER. Their customer is advertising. And Apple doesn't need them. 

Where I'm from, material cost money to buy. Don't think for a second FB can't make money from the free service they provide while still harvesting YOU as the material for the product they sell without data mining you. TV and radio has been doing it for years.

2021-05-08 16:59:58,stocks,"I disagree. While Facebook will certainly lose some revenue, as a large company they can adapt and survive.  They'll still get plenty of ads from large corporations that appeal to a broad audience, and they can charge users to access the platform if they opt out of targeting. They can also lay off many of their workers to reduce costs and focus on providing cash flow to investors.

I'd argue the companies most affected would be small digital niche businesses that rely on targeted ads to drive marketing.

If you have a product that only interests 0.001% of the population, advertising via traditional means(advertising to everyone) isn't effective. Paying for ad impressions when 99.999% of your users aren't interested doesn't work. 

Marketing via social media presence isn't that effective anymore either, as community-based sites like Reddit generally don't allow self-promotion."

Forums have largely been replaced by social media which has done horrible things to our world. If removing targeted ads means the death of social media and a return to websites that cater to a single broad interest, it's worth it to me."
2021-05-08 11:26:19,stocks,"If there is a big ad pop it will mean a lot more companies will start throwing up pay walls, which will upset people more than the ads ever did.

That said,ad tech is a massive international industry, it won't collapse overnight. They are preparing for this with Account Based Marketing and the like."
2021-05-08 11:01:37,stocks,"Good, fuck Palantir."

2021-05-08 00:16:30,stocks,this *was* their workaround.
2021-05-08 13:29:23,stocks,"All they have to do is pay people. And if the profit margin per person isn't enough for a noticeable payment, enter people into monthly sweepstakes for $500 USD. The big tech companies employ some of the highest paid developers and PMs in the world. They can figure out a way to incentivize people for their data."
2021-05-08 15:43:21,stocks,"What? They ask you for permissions because Apple/Android forced them to ask for permissions, to protect you from it. Before they used to not even ask just and take all your data."
2021-05-08 07:24:41,stocks,"99,9999999999% of the time targeted ads with several years worth of my search and watch history are still completely off point. Targeted ads are completely irrelevant, just throw generalized ads at people and be done with it."
2021-05-08 17:15:18,stocks,">It does though. Without tracking you get shitty irrelevant ads. Most are too low iq to understand. As for privacy this achieves the opposite walled gardens with 10x the data like Amazon. Gg data sjws

You really arguing that ads are relevant to the functionality of the app? The fuck?

Even if anybody cared about the ads they get, which they don't, it's still not relevant. Your argument doesn't make you any less ""low-IQ"", lol"
2021-05-08 11:27:58,stocks,Sounds like something a Facebook team member might say..
2021-05-07 23:54:31,stocks,"Get ready for the ads like 


‚ÄúSmall dick? Add two inches two your dick with this daily pill!‚Äù

And stuff that totally doesn‚Äôt apply to you."
2021-05-08 00:05:22,stocks,"Doesn't even need to be a search that's been forgotten. Some MarTech is now sophisticated enough to be predictive. Build enough anonymized personas and you can guess that after buying a couch someone will buy shoes or a fishing pole and it goes from there. (Remember the story about the time Target knew that woman/teen was pregnant before she knew?)

There's MarTech that only uses first person data that can cross platforms AND in-store shopping down to the individual user, not just the device or household. 

It's crazy sophisticated now. But, also crazy expensive. Only the cheaper software is working on basic searches now."
2021-05-08 00:10:44,stocks,"My SO bought an exercise bike a few months ago. I never googled it or any other home exercise equipment because I go to the gym, no need to do absolutely everything at home. She called me to tell me it was delivered, and when I got off the phone I was getting ads for that exact bike not an hour later on Facebook. 

I‚Äôve never googled it, I don‚Äôt Google anything similar, I don‚Äôt follow exercise accounts. Zero reason for me to start getting ads for exercise equipment."
2021-05-07 23:45:37,stocks,"I honestly think it comes down more to the fact that we are so attuned to advertising, that we don‚Äôt notice how often it is. ~~We see~~ The average person sees between 6,000 and 10,000 ads per day, it‚Äôs not unlikely that once in awhile, we see an ad relevant to something we recently talked or thought about, especially when those ads are tailored towards us."
2021-05-08 00:57:30,stocks,"Both are true. They go with multiple avenues. In the comment, that is advertising using your microphone to generate leads. I've turned my microphone access off on my Samsung Note 10+, it still happens to me.

A pizza brand I mentioned to someone in passing on the street showed up on ads not a half hour later. 

In these instances it's purely intrusion. 

The profiles they build are typically done off public data. I wouldn't be surprised if the legal context for what their app can use the microphone to access is what's spoken aloud or written."
2021-05-07 23:51:59,stocks,"How did the profiles get so accurate? Because they monitor every facet of your life. Why would they draw the line at the microphone? I know people who have worked on smart TVs and they installed microphones so that they could fingerprint the content you were watching. It‚Äôs so weird that people think they‚Äôre tracked everywhere else, but for some reason that doesn‚Äôt apply to the microphone."
2021-05-07 23:54:30,stocks,"This right here is how it works. They aren‚Äôt listening to everything. Honestly I wish this was the case. The truth is the models that are being built on our minds, wants, and personalities are so accurate it can seem like we‚Äôre being listened to 24/7. I find this a lot more scary and intrusive than being listened in on. It‚Äôs like they know your next thought before you do.

The ‚Äúthey are always listening‚Äù argument is the simple one, but it isn‚Äôt true. The truth is there‚Äôs a model of your mind that had been constructed on some servers somewhere that knows you better than you know yourself."
2021-05-08 00:23:22,stocks,"But that‚Äôs also pretty intrusive, isn‚Äôt it? I mean, no matter how they‚Äôre doing it, the fact still remains they‚Äôre getting way to close to most of us to be comfortable"
2021-05-07 23:50:43,stocks,Someone already debunked this‚Ä¶ the phone is 100% listening to you. They were able to prove it by purposely saying they needed things they didn‚Äôt need to see how long it took to get an ad for that thing. :) you can‚Äôt profile someone to suggest something they don‚Äôt need can you?
2021-05-08 00:36:02,stocks,"actually there is a lot of apps that want permission to access mic, camera, gps and even use your phones IMU (inertial measurement unit) to track so many things you do. The IMU is so sensative that it can actually interpret what you are say just from vibrations when you talk, it can even predict where you might be when you turn off GPS, WIFI, bluetooth and anything else tracking related. IMU seems to not be easy to disable, maybe if you put your phone into developer mode and enable/add the ""sensors off"" feature to the drop down menu (talking about android tho) which comes with it's own quirks. 

Apps track how long you are in what store, what aisles you frequent and how long you spend in said aisles of the store. They look for every single scummy way to collect every single tiny detail about you. I have no doubts they listen in cuz i get plenty of ads that pertain to things i've only talked about, and i reset my ad-ID when this starts happening, but it has been a repetitive occurrence for me, and i go out of my way to make sure every app i have installed has the fewest possible permissions i can possibly give them and constantly try to close all apps so that nothing can glide through on the ""grant permission: while app in use"" feature.

coming from somebody who's been focused on internet privacy since before it was cool. sure i don't have citations, just my personal experiences"
2021-05-07 23:50:59,stocks,"This 100%. I‚Äôm assuming he has an iPhone, and if he does there will be an orange indicator light at the top of his screen letting him know *every single time* the mic is used. I‚Äôve never seen FB or Instagram use my mic after leaving the app, and not even the app is in use either; only when I go to post something."
2021-05-07 23:54:24,stocks,"Thank you. This is the most probable explanation. Probably the best response here. 

People being paranoid that google and fb are listening to them makes me truly chuckle. Nobody cares about what nonsense you have to say. Literally no one. Stop thinking too much of yourself and follow logic and science, not misinformation and rumors."
2021-05-08 02:46:30,stocks,"It‚Äôs happening right now. It‚Äôs been happening for eons now.

‚ÄúTracking cookies omg!!‚Äù Lol. Give me a sample of a month‚Äôs worth of Google searches ‚Äî just the search query and the first link selected ‚Äî and even I‚Äôll be able to start finding patterns in it as a weekend project.

Multiply that by a gazillion times.
The number of searches, end users, analysts. Imagine what they‚Äôll be able to find?

Track the User-Agent and IP, and maybe store a cookie so you can correlate activity to users. Interesting: people who search for ‚Äúrush concert‚Äù are 30% more likely to also be interested in ‚Äúbalding treatment reviews‚Äù compared to those who seem to like Nirvana more.

Let‚Äôs do a test and put brand X ahead of Y for some people. Do they get the first click? Do the users come back and click Y?

What result snippets work best? ‚Äú1 capsule a day keeps the baldness away!‚Äù didn‚Äôt work as well as ‚ÄúEffective, affordable, and confidential.‚Äù

However, after further analysis...Bon Jovi fans might actually like the goofy version better.

At this point, you have an absolute gold mine that just bubbles over. A massive dataset that allows you to answer more questions than you or I could ever even think to ask. Set machine learning and your army of analysts against it, and you‚Äôre set.

Oh but wait, this whole time Google Analytics is being used across over 50% of the Web.

Facebook is even more intrusive. They analyze not only how people interact with Internet, but also how they interact with *each other*.

For women ages 20-30 that have a decent friend who has had a baby within the last year, what is the rate of pregnancy? What keywords are present in their conversations in the month leading up to conception?

Heck, what brand of makeup do brunette females between the ages of 13-24 who take selfies in the bathroom mirror tend to like?

Google and Facebook are as big as they are because they hold the answers to every company‚Äôs questions about the consumers they seek to attract. And you have to admit, they earned their worth.

And while Facebook went to the level of hijacking Android messages and whatnot, which I agree is sleazy, would rather someone read your text message history, or your search history correlated by User-Agent and IP?

But no, Zuckerberg really did it this time! I‚Äôm going to warn my friends on Facebook that no one should install the Android app.

What search terms do people who uninstall the Facebook app for Android usually search next?

We should be grateful that they‚Äôre only focused on marketing and advertisement. We should use this chance to pass laws that protect our data from being abused.

We should also stop bitching about issues that miss the forest for the trees. Google doesn‚Äôt care about the audio snippet of you listening to porn full blast. They care FAR more about what you buy afterward."
2021-05-08 03:15:06,stocks,My roommate and I were in the store and he said he needed to grab some tums. Had tums ads in my Twitter app later on. Very sus. And pointless seeing ads for something already purchased. Its like when I Google a store and the first link is an ad for that store. They are wasting money on ads when the customer was already a customer. Or seeing an ad for something I already bought popping up over and over.
2021-05-08 10:05:44,stocks,Ok but the majority of the time it‚Äôs not that

2021-05-08 02:03:34,stocks,"Good point. I use Chrome. And Facebook. And Apple products.

Even besides the fact that target ads were explained many times, the whole listening and analyzing part is plain impossible.

2021-05-08 00:54:00,stocks,Exactly. The large companies can handle having no tracking. Coca Cola is perfectly fine spamming ads out to everyone across any demographic. The pub down the street? Ads that aren't highly targeted are going to be worthless.

If I can be frank, the problem with this business model for FB, Reddit, Tiktok, Instagram, YouTube and Google is that they don't care about their ""users"" (which are also their products). They build algorithms to intice people to remain on their platforms and not go anywhere. The machines are winning and not just the privacy is affected. People's mental health too including children.

In a way, I care about privacy but the mental health and the mental capacity and the society as a whole is destroyed by this business model. People are becoming zombies who can't leave their cellphones and who can believe in the weirdest shit ever with no backing. Please look around when you go anywhere.

In a way you are giving money to someone who destroys the fabric of society as we know it. So please look into that"

If the default is they DON'T track you, you don't need to do anything to stay untracked. You would need to opt in to be tracked.

Most people do the thing that takes the least effort, which is sticking to the default. Changing a setting from opt-out to opt-in heavily influences the number of people who end up tracked."

2021-05-08 03:46:59,stocks,"I think the big differences here is how Apple is using the data in their ad network. They've already made it clear that they're going to hold themselves to the same standards as everyone else in 14.5. But even if you do allow them to use your data, they're really not getting a ton. They aren't selling it to third parties, they aren't mixing the data they have on you with data they get from third parties, they aren't even targeting you as an individual. Instead, your data is anonymized and mixed in with a group of 5,000 other individuals with similar preferences to yours. Then you're all targeted together. If they can't find a group with enough people to lump you in with, they just won't give you targeted advertisements. 

There's some nit-picky stuff you could say about their advertising, but it's really pretty mundane. They aren't building an individualized profile on you or giving away your information. You're just getting some potentially targeted ads in the App Store, Stocks, and News if you don't turn the tracking off."
2021-05-08 04:22:49,stocks,"I disagree, Apple has never made money on user data, its not their business model at all. They dont even store user data, they use Amazon servers for all users cloud back ups and storage. 

They are a walled garden, and a major feature and selling point about their products is security and user experience. Its the main reason they dont collect data on users, they dont need to. Thats what companies do to make money when their services arnt worth paying for. 

Apple has no need to enter a completely oversaturated and competitive market like data collection and selling. 

Honestly I think most of the targeted adversiting is complete bullshit anyway. I have never once purchase anything based on an online ad ever and I always get hit with ads for shit similar products I already purchased recently. Its a joke.

Well almost all cellular connections are metered to some extent and I can almost guarantee that almost everyone reading this has a data limit they can hit before the internet becomes basically unusable for the month. Of course you can pay more at an exorbitant rate to get extra data but the bottom line is that every megabyte of data is extremely valuable to users. Well when you are constantly being bombarded by ads around every turn those advertiser are actually taking money out of your pocket with every single megabyte of data that those ads take up. Video advertising is especially egregious in this respect. You are not only being forced to watch the ads you are being charged to see them at the same time."

Advertisers can buy BAT and spent it on advertisement, or you can convert it to USDC or DOGE and spend it like cash, although transfer fees and conversion rates will be harsh, so I intend to donate my BAT to wikipedia, since it makes no difference to me."

You can't track ROAS with a nation wide TV campaign its purely for product awareness, but you can track ROAS and other KPIs directly on online ad platforms. The fear is that without being able to serve ads to the people who actually might buy the product, advertising on Facebook will cease to be profitable, and ad dollars will be pulled from the platform. I work with brands that run millions through Facebook every year, that would completely leave the platform, and double down on google if Facebook ceased to be profitable. Im not defending FB here, life will go on, but Redditors with 150 followers on instagram, who don't use Facebook completely underestimate how attached to these services the rest of the world is.

I just get annoyed at people praising Apple is some paragon of pro-user company compared to the rest of FANG stocks. Apple's business model is simply different. It isn't pro-user. Apple's fight against right to repair, the exorbitantly expensive Apple repairs, making almost all Apple parts proprietary, and making iTunes basically the only way to interact with your own IPhone files on a PC (without installing unsupported 3rd party apps and/jumping through hoops) all shows that Apple doesn't really care about users. 

Apple (and Amazon) just happened to monetize their users in a different way. They extract dollars from their users directly as opposed to using their users to generate revenue from another company.  I don't see that as being better.

Also, I feel like a lot of people aren't considering that this will not just hurt the amount of ad buys, but the price of them. Without the literal straight-from-old-dystopia-movies efficacy of targeted ads we've had for the last decade or so, they will surely not be able to keep the same price or generate the same amount of clicks as before.

 As I'm typing this, I'm realizing that this actually does hurt small businesses the most because they are less likely to be able to afford broad scope advertising that will probably end up costing more than the super-targeted and be less effective. I still am on board with it, tho."

2021-05-08 03:47:09,stocks,"That‚Äôs exactly what I was going for. I was *confirming* my understanding of your point.

Beyond the controversy that has swirled around Facebook for *years*, their Android app made headline news for collecting data from people‚Äôs phones, specifically text messages. You have it on your phone.

Facebook used that audio sample to personalize the user experience. Imagine how many people click ‚ÄúConnect‚Äù (or whatever the hell it‚Äôs called these days), and reconnect with a long-lost friend. They find Facebook more valuable, they spend more time on it, and more data is available for user behavior analytics.

If a user accepts the suggestion, that indicates that the audio analysis was correct, as well as the selection of the recommended friend. It trains the algorithm.

And again, it‚Äôs already well-known that Alexa has picked up countless snippets of awkward moments. If you‚Äôre so concerned,* get rid of the Amazon Echo*! Or at least unplug it when you bang.

And geez, are you kidding me? Amazon became the behemoth they are today because their machine learning is so good that it markets condoms for somebody just because they heard them having sex the night before. üòÇ

They already know the relevant products for me. They also know what the average expecting father wants ‚Äî and they‚Äôll probably start to recommend it to me the very week I‚Äôm expecting.

They don‚Äôt give a shit about 10 second clips with moaning and screaming and crap like that. On the other hand, they care 100% about what playlist the average person asks Alexa to play when precipitation starts and the temperature is between 50-55 outside ‚Äî because they can experiment with the track order and see what happens from there.

Anyway, all that to say:

-	Yeah, it‚Äôs kinda freaky.
-	They already know far more than that. Chances are they understand your own habits better than you.
-	You have a Facebook account. Did you not read the EULA you agreed to?

2021-05-08 11:34:13,stocks,"Agreed. People hate on Apple so much they fail to see how and why people like them or the positive things they have done. 

A primary reason people hate on Apple is because they charge so much for their hardware, and it‚Äôs absolutely true. They charge a ton for their hardware that you could get way cheaper with a pc. But you know what you don‚Äôt get with your computer from Apple? Built in ads. 

My room mate and I were talking about it not long ago and I told him to count how many ads were built into his computer. There‚Äôs some on the login screen, there‚Äôs some in the start menu, the wall paper is a fucking ad if you let it stay on default. It‚Äôs stupid. You also have next to no control. For years I kept turning off auto update, and it just kept fucking updating no matter what I did. Back when windows was pushing everyone to switch to windows 10 it kept asking me to upgrade for free. I kept saying no because I like 7. After months of clicking no I went to work for the day and when I came back it had forcefully updated to windows 10, and of course you can‚Äôt switch back. 

People can continue to shit on Apple all they want, but the fact of the matter is Apple provides better service, cleaner tech, easier to use tech, and better privacy than any other company on the planet in both the cell phone and computer market. 

It‚Äôs quite literally quantifiable too, they are the most profitable and valuable company by double. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs only because of Apple fan boys!!‚Äù Yeah fans of the product they provide. People are willing to pay to not have their fucking data harvested and their every move watched. Apple has proven it. Facebook wants to keep it the way it is because they know if they lose the ability to harvest data they lose money and their product and service isn‚Äôt good enough to pay for. Apple doesn‚Äôt need to harvest data, people will pay them not to and it‚Äôs clear it‚Äôs more valuable to let a user purchase their privacy than invade it.

But if your concern is that advertisements will consume data, you need not worry. It's quite easy to build rules to not consume certain types of usage of bundles or to price usage differently. 

&#x200B;

You're referring to ""throttling"" where a provider will deliberately slow down your data speeds, and that is a thing. It used to be more of a thing, but actually data is considerably cheaper than it used to be and most telco's are moving to a ""managed service"" model. This is more visible and obvious in B2B, but in B2C it's now much more common to have ""post-pay"" instead of ""pre-pay"" and to encourage you to take big bundles to cover your usage, typically because this is efficient (my last B2C employer, average utilisation of bundles was 23%) - especially for MVNOs who don't own the network but have access to it, who will be charged by the MNO who own the network for your usage - but also because it gives me predictable revenue, which businesses and shareholders tend to like. In my current employer, 83% of our revenue is from recurring, and when I was talking to an excited American at 8x8, they referred to usage costs as ""The race to zero"", in part because services like Skype have made usage feel free, another reason why telco's are moving to big bundles over usage charging, people feel they get better value."

Its just annoying that during every change that is good for the individual and bad for companies bottom fucking line we get so much fear mongering. Every fucking time no matter how ridiculous. Now all small and medium businesses are going to fail bc people get some semblance of internet privacy. They crossed all kinds of lines and made a metric fuckton of money by going farther than they shouldve in the first place. And now the first and slightest bit of pushback thats good for the average joe and ‚ÄúaLL sMaLL aNd MeDiUm businesses WiLL FAiL!‚Äù Obnoxious. Everyone having a mobile computer and 24/7 internet is extended new. Like in the last ten years new. How quickly we forget. 

Its annoying people are crying that having to actually figure out where to put ads the in order to get views from your target audience instead of having a computer clicky click for you is going be the end for all business as we know it. Businesses have been selling things without algorithms since the beginning of time. Having surgical precision on ad targeting is very new. It slimmed many businesses advertising budgets and there is nothing wrong with that. The problem lies in the idea that businesses and money come before an actual living breathing human beings rights. And this fear driven propaganda that businesses will fail because of this is laughable. Will you have a harder time trying to figure out your target audience? Yea. Will your budget go up for awhile or maybe even permanently? Possibly! Will that cost more depending on how good your marketing person is? Sure will! Does that mean some advertisers are going to have their asses shown bc algos have been doing the heavy lifting for the last ten years? Yip! If you have a solid business and stable financials should you be ok? YEP! 

People want to tout the free market and the free market will decide! Until its themselves. The free market decided it doesn‚Äôt want its data taken. In addition other companies are making a dick load of money off that data that isn‚Äôt even theirs! They just take it bc most people don‚Äôt know how VPNs work. Then we also get to wonder if (read: when) that stolen information is going to be stolen *again* in a data breach. 

Who told people just because you start a business it implicitly means that business is going to survive. I love that this country has a ton of small and medium businesses and I‚Äôm in the group that believes we should have more. But the rule has been that it must be a viable businesses. Additionally, every business just doesn‚Äôt have the right to do whatever and infringe on peoples rights because the alternative is their bottom line takes a dip or worse they go out of business. If you cant survive, then you don‚Äôt. Opening a business is not a guarantee to never see that business fail. Its a risk. Id say if you cannot manage a 10-30% increase in your advertising budget alone then you need to take a look at your business plan and that businesses viability. 

Im willing to bet the fucking farm these same people who cant see the good of the individual over the almighty dollar are the same folks that are opting out of being tracked. They don‚Äôt want to be tracked EW! Their data is more important than other peoples data. Their data means more than other peoples data. Its just not the same! They have to opt out they cant have their information out there all willy nilly! Or they cant possibly have their data out there because of blah, blah, blah. And they do not see the ocean sized pool of irony when they hit that opt out button after they cry about everything previously mentioned. But they 100% want everyone else to be tracked. This way they can save a few thousand bucks on their business expenses. That way they can precisely target where to display their ads. Even if they have to steal the information, but it will cost them a little less to advertise so its fair right? Right?"

Doing anything to tarnish that would wipe out any good will they have and rightfully drive a lot of people away. However, if they keep your privacy private, they can continue on down the path that's made them the richest company on the stock market. 

I'm also not trying to say that Apple is a perfect company who does nothing wrong. But all we have to go on is logic and history right now. Logically, it would hurt them to renege on their privacy stance. And historically, it's clear they haven't been using our privacy so far. So many companies have complained they don't share data and a lot of their products are worse off for it. 

Apple TV is built around a user interface where all of your video apps and subscriptions are gathered in one place. But Netflix, the leader in streaming, wouldn't join in because Apple wouldn't share data about the viewers. And I believe someone else (it might be HBO) just left or is leaving. Siri has sucked since the beginning and lagged behind of competitors. That's because Apple doesn't gather the data that Google and others do. Look at Apple Maps. It's actually pretty good now that their own cars have been driving the roads like Google does, but it took how many years to get to a level of near-parity? Apple tracks some information on how users are using Maps, but they don't log complete trips. Instead they break it up into anonymized chunks. So one chunk of data might show you leaving your house, another might show you making some turns, and another shows you arriving at a location. But it doesn't see the complete route you as an individual took. That's tough when you're trying to improve products. 

The evidence is pretty clear already. They collect a minimum of data, don't share it, and anonymize and randomize it until it's not even clear what's coming from who. I'll take that ANY day over what someone like Facebook is doing. Could they change in the future? Of course. It happens all the time. But customers are buying based on right now, not an unlikely potential for down the line."

Businesses would be paying a lot more for less traffic, because without the hyperspecific user data they may as well be putting up the digital equivalent of a highway billboard. And while that may work for some businesses, plenty of others have built their entire structure around low cost and hyper targeted advertising, where their customer base entirely depends on it and their margins are too small to accept higher costs. 

And while those companies can provide societal benefits in potentially more productive companies, IMO it is the digital equivalent of companies that pollute and would be driven out of business by regulations setting environmental protection standards. And to those who may not think advertising works on you, I can tell you that it definitely works on some people, like compulsive shoppers and spenders which uses the same fundamental mechanisms inside the brain that drive people towards alcohol and drug addictions. Social arguments aside, from a moral perspective it is also about user choice and consent, and control over our own data."

Not true. First of all, it's not common to update your profile with workplace or married/single status anymore, at least not for younger people.

Running a pub is an expensive game, and yes, advertising works. So, yeah, the pub advertises where they can get the most out of their very small advertising budget. Targeted ads just raise the value of ads. 

Sports pub? Targeted ads. Hipster bar? Targeted ads. Brew pub? Targeted ads. Every business is looking for people who will be fans of their business. Every person is looking for businesses that meet their needs. It is not creepy or weird to bridge that gap."
2021-05-08 05:00:37,stocks,"I get what the point is. I don't even disagree that small businesses who have business models that rely on users having no privacy will be hurt. But that's just how it is. There's two opposing forces here. There are companies that want uninhibited access to our data regardless of whether we want to give it to them, and there's users that don't want to give out their data. If your business won't survive unless they can track everything I do, say, and look at, then I don't think it should survive because I don't want companies like Facebook to know that. 

When I said the pub down the street only has to advertise to people in the area, that was me saying that small businesses will have to find a way to work within the confines of what the people want or die. Marketing based on an entire ecosystem of data that was taken from users who didn't want to give it to them is not the right way to do it.

2021-05-08 05:55:52,stocks,"they can see who you messaged and when.  they cant see the contents of the message.  Apple can, and they only give that up for stuff like FISA warrants."
2021-05-08 09:29:28,stocks,"To be clear, we can see the contents of SMS', not the contents of messenger conversations. That looks like a data event, so we can see you're having a Skype conversation, for example, but we can't see the contents. 

&#x200B;

It would also be the same if you had a WhatsApp call. I could tell that you have been using WhatsApp, but I cannot see the contents of the conversation because the contents aren't sent to the telco network, only a stream of data telling me what service you are using to consume your data.

&#x200B;

Different regions have different legal rule, but my region insists we keep the traffic for 2 years and have to share it with the police under certain rules (basically a warrant, it's all extremely official and recorded by providers and the regulator, plus the police, you assume). 

&#x200B;

Seeing what program you're using or what website you're using allows the provider to build rules in mediation and the PCRF (Policy and Charging Rules Function). As an example, you might be out of data, but I want to give you the option to purchase more from my website (which would typically require data), so I allow you to visit my telco company website, but you won't be charged for it. Likewise make sure if you did have a data bundle, we'd not decrement from it if you visited the website. If I'm a business customer to a telco, I might want my engineers to only access certain sites, and again we can build that logic into systems (both these things are real world examples). We also have options further downstream, with rating (think network > mediation > rating > bill), so I can allow you to call 911/999/112 free of charge, or I can have a premium rate number but see you're phone number and because you are a customer not a rando, charge you differently or not at all. Options are basically endless. 

&#x200B;

So in short, it depends if the usage is going over the network as to whether we can see the contents of it. If it's a standard voice call, or an SMS, absolutely we see that. If it's using a 3rd party tool, we can see what tool you're using, but not the contents of it. We use some of this information to create business rules for various reasons"
2021-05-08 17:18:39,stocks,"Everything you send over the internet can be seen by your ISP, OEM (i.e Apple/Google/Microsoft) and any companies clever enough to track you through your browser, IP address, email, or other apps. 

Even actions you take but do not send can be recorded. For example, google predicting what you‚Äôre typing halfway through and querying their severs for results before you‚Äôre even done typing a full word. Or, you writing a comment out but deleting it before sending it.

Even if you are disconnected from the internet your device can store data and wait to upload it once you are connected.

You can use a VPN, Linux, encrypt your data (.zip files conveniently offer this which are useful for sending over the internet already) DuckDuckGo.com and some other means I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm forgetting to help get around all the tracking. Data is a big business and most people will submit their data for the convenience of not having to get a VPN, learn linux, etc. Having all your data tracked is still your choice‚Äîits just become more difficult because a lot of powerful services don‚Äôt offer a paid model.

I would love if google/fb/amazon etc. had a paid option so that users could choose to be tracked or instead pay $5 a month or something."

Honestly, there is soooo much traffic, unless we have a reason to go snooping, we just don't care. But now I am curious, what's your account number ;). 

Did once have a case where an employee at the telco I was working for was premium rate calls. Phoned them up for research and regretted my decision as I was confronted with granny dominant type sex lines. We had a good snigger, after the guy had been fired as despite being warned, did it again! Guess he just wanted to be punished.."

I think most are hopefully clear, but to explain MVNO v MNO. An MNO is a network operator, in that they own the network. Rest from Wikipedia who are summarising better than I can! "" A **mobile virtual network operator** (**MVNO**) is a **wireless communications services provider** that does not own the [wireless network infrastructure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_station_subsystem) over which it provides services to its customers. An MVNO enters into a business agreement with a [mobile network operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_network_operator) to obtain bulk access to network services at wholesale rates, then sets retail prices independently""

If the public doesn't agree then I see that as a marketing issue of its own

 If your basic dimensions worked as well as targeted ads then no one would use targeted ads. However, I don't have a multimillion dollar budget to show ads to entire cities worth of people hoping to hit the few hundred or thousand that might be interested in my business. But, for about $20/day, I can reach crazy numbers of people that actually have a pretty good shot at being interested in my stuff. That year of marketing budget that reaches thousands of directed individuals would pay for one billboard for 3 months in my city, or a tv spot for maybe a week. The value proposition is just insane"

I don‚Äôt see any good argument for this tbh as a consumer. If I was in business and it was hurting my bottom line, maybe I‚Äôd agree with you.

what is strange is we have well-defined understandings in other contexts in order to protect people from the implications of sharing data (HIPA), but suddenly every time we are in the context of advertising and we say, ""currently anything goes and this is bad, let us change that,"" everyone loses their minds. 

i guess youre completely okay with arbitrarily sharing your, or your customer's, medical information, then, yeah? no risk and it would be irrational to be concerned about anything, as you say. so put up or shut up, upload your full medical history to reddit. hell, while youre at it go ahead and post your financial records, your name and full address, cell phone. upload your outstanding debt and payment history. be sure to include your phone's contact book and email list. also im really interested in license plates if you own a car, and perhaps some photographs of yourself and your family. maybe even get the house or apartment in the background for extra wholesomeness. remember because not wanting to share any of the above unknowingly is irrational and there is absolutely no risk.

But Google probably has significantly more data to make that easier just by the nature of being the default search engine. And the thing is though, this pop up only appears when that company wants to track your data on *other* third party websites. Within their own first party apps there is no pop up. 

So Google has the inherent advantage, where all their apps are self contained within their own ecosystem. They dont need to track you across third party websites, because they know which third party websites you're going to in the first place. Facebook previously could collect iOS user data on not just people using facebook, but also google, or any search engine on any browser that leads to any site on facebook's ad network. This is actually more or less the same problem the EU tried to solve through the GDPR and cookies. 

So really this is just google watching Tim Apple bash Zuccs knee in with a crowbar. Ultimately Apple is the biggest winner here, because they have the moral high ground on user choice and consent, and data privacy. Google comes out of this with a gimped competitor and with their own business model of keeping their data within the company intact, and because they see this increasing trend of privacy oriented legislation and consumer demand, rolled out a new anonymized system of cohort tracking because they have the existing infrastructure to do so. So this is how we get to right now, where Facebook has to roll out this whole PR campaign pretending they care about small businesses in order to protect the their business model and bottom line."

2021-05-08 14:45:34,stocks,"Yes, it's a reasonable argument. I was personally involved in a police request for a compromised PBX, that turned out to be part of a network of compromised PBXs, and long story short, the people doing this were selling phone cards in 3rd world countries as quasi-legit business people, only the phone systems weren't theirs and they were basically leaving those owners of the phone systems with huge bills for that usage and they just made 100% profit on the sale of phone cards. The scale was almost admirable, the hackers absolutely know their shit.

&#x200B;

""Dial Through Fraud"" is also quite common. Again personally involved in a listed insurance company and a 7 figure fraud, where hacker had gained access to mailboxes, routed those mailboxes to premium rate services they controlled, then used another compromised phone system to spam call the mailboxes which routed to the premium numbers and they presumably collected the rebate from that. I literally stood behind our main Mitel engineer with CEO (who was an engineer, and this was our largest customer) as he tried to fix it, and in live time the hackers were still trying to redirect stuff. Was weirdly intense. There are mechanisms in place to try and manage this, but a lot of vested interest and yaawwwn no victims/white collar crime apathy.

&#x200B;

It is also crazy how many people, including PBX engineers, use passwords like 2580 or 1111 or etc. Human vulnerability is definitely a thing.

&#x200B;

I did some proof of concept with with an AI provider and large telco to introduce logic into their systems. We accepted that PBXs will often be compromised so looked instead to have controls on the usage. If usage suddenly spiked to a premium rate destination in Nigeria, and the customer never called Nigeria, then we would block that at a network level in near real time. We had a architectural client who often took calls from exotic locations at funny hours though, so we built in much higher tolerances. To be fair, that was almost 10 years ago, and I've never really seen a product from it. But I have seen providers incentivise the upgrading to SIP/hosting and offering toll fraud insurance, presumably they have such a system in the background. To me, detection of fraud at a network level is the best long term approach to stop fraud, as well as things like regulators stepping up as oftentimes there are no reasons for 20$ a minute call charges and niche solutions have been replaced by mobile / standard non-geographic / SIP solutions so they should be phased out."

2021-05-08 08:17:58,stocks,"You‚Äôre getting downvoted but you‚Äôre correct about one thing; Android is too broad to compare to a walled garden like iOS.  Everyone above whining about encryption and claiming the previous commenter had no idea what they‚Äôre talking about has no idea what they‚Äôre talking about themselves.  Google has repeatedly refused to provide end-to-end encryption for the stock Android Messenger app.  Sure you can download signal; but that‚Äôs not the answer.  Instead google left end-to-end encryption up to the carriers, because ‚Äúwe‚Äôre so open brah‚Äù; and that in itself is the problem.  There‚Äôs too many hands involved in the distribution of Android, and not enough hands in control.

The fact that I can download a game, open it up in apktool, change some logos, title, colors, add some un-needed permissions, and reupload it to the store is Androids biggest problem right now in my opinion.

I believe opendoor tech will be the future.

Has the most untapped revenue verticals (video, AR/VR, payments, Angie's List type of service referrals, hardware (Portal/Oculus), dating, WhatsApp and Instagram.

Adobe - a ""baby FAANG"" that has more room to run, market cap-wise, than FAANG. 

Salesforce - same reason as Adobe above, baby FAANG. 

Intuit - under the radar, category killer with tax and accounting software 

Pinterest - scarce social media property that is adding e-commerce functionality with Shopify. 

WISH - WISH's global eCommerce marketplace has an affordable/entertaining mobile shopping experience. Its focus on value conscious consumers, unique array of unbranded product selection from global merchants, and data science driven approach is very sophisticated. In terms of upside, there is potential in local delivery/fulfillment, branded inventory efforts & a subscription revenue stream. The Company is projecting positive EBIT in 2022. A modest 4x P/S multiple at that time should result in a doubling of the stock price from current levels.

Cronos (CRON) - big tobacco's Altria (MO), the largest tobacco company in USA, backs this company with 45% ownership and will likely plug and play its products like a light switch upon federal legalization into its huge point of service network of over 250,000 locations (i.e. convenience stores, etc) is the cannabis company that will likely be the ultimate winner. They are avoiding expensive growing methods by using a creative approach announcing that they will be introducing synthetic cannabinoids for the Canadian market for a 10 cents a gram:

Aside from Cronos, I think the ancillary cannabis companies are the way to play weed stocks because they don't contain cannabis and hence allow listing on the most liquid exchanges such as Nasdaq and institutional money can pour into these cannabis related names now/today as opposed to being shut out of other companies that contain cannabis because institutional money usually has mandates to not allow investing in something that is Federally illegal:

Hydrofarm (HYFM) - IPOed in Dec and a leading hydroponics manufacturer and distributor

GrowGeneration (GRWG) - leading hydroponics retailer

Weedmaps (SSPK) - unique, direct to consumer (DTC), cannabis play on the intersection of tech and cannabis. A type of Uber, Amazon, Yelp and Shopify all rolled into one for cannabis products. A SPAC that will turn into WeedMaps during sometime in the 1st half of this year. This one is special. 

Tim Seymour's cannabis ETF (CNBS) owns a big position in WeedMaps and smaller positions in GrowGeneration and Hydrofarm:

Twitter (TWTR) - is a unique social media equity that has achieved critical mass. It may have kinks in it in its current state, and yes, I think Dorsey being so egotistical to think he can be a co-CEO of both Square and Twitter is disgusting (as is his beard), but there is a user base there. It might shock people that the political user base only comprises a low teens % component of their total user base with the rest being news, sports and entertainment. Twitter has made some acquisitions recently of Squad and Breaker that really puts them into interesting territory of peer to peer browsing, audio and podcasting - things people should not overlook. 

Coinbase (COIN) - is one of the top 5 most profitable exchanges in the world. Coinbase might make more money than Nasdaq. Coinbase is gonna be huge because this is the first time we are going to be able to directly play crypto in the equity market. Why I like COIN is that it is a play on Bitcoin AND all the other coins out there...whereas bitcoin is just a play on bitcoin, so you are getting all the other coins for free. COIN is heavily (96%) tied to the price of bitcoin, which is very hard to predict. Another advantage of COIN being the first crypto exchange coming onto the market first is that they potentially can use their stock as currency to buy any other competitors. And you don't have to believe in the crypto party line and the dangers of fiat currency and how you need an alternative, because central banks all over the world are printing money like crazy - even if you think this is nonsense, we know that there is a market for this kind of nonsense because gold bugs have been saying the same thing for decades. In other words, crypto has a natural constituency. Like gold, people buy it as a kind of inflation insurance and gold's strength is its scarcity - its supply only increases about 1% per year and it is getting harder and harder to find more - that sounds a lot like Bitcoin to me and I think it is totally legitimate to believe that crypto, in general, can rival gold as a storehold of value."

Palihapitiya (the only other notable insider sell) is a venture capitalist, that's literally what he does. He sold his holdings (after making an insane profit) to fund other ventures; he still has ownership in SPCE via a partnership and has stated he remains involved with the company.

SpaceX and Blue Origin both have vertical launch infrastructure. Not nearly as accessible to the general public, nor proven to be as safe as horizontal. Not to mention horizontal launch is exponentially more efficient and cost effective for sub-orbital travel over vertical launches. That's all to say, neither SpaceX or BO have proper business models in place specifically for tourism and accessibility, or at least certainly not in the niche that SPCE is/could dominate.

That's just not even true lol, there's talks of an *inquiry* into a class action. Yea obviously that's not a good look, but we'll see if it has any legs.

I'm not pretending to be some genius stock analyst, but all I know is there's many companies right now with massive valuations to live up. Doesn't make them bad companies.

2021-05-08 00:00:00,stocks,"Help me understand Cathie Wood's math on her projected returns Recent interview of Cathie Wood on CNBC (search YouTube for ""I love this setup, rotation is good news"" to find video) got my head scratching around the math she just did in her statements. Back in February she said she expects 15% YoY compounded returns in next 5 years when ARK funds (say ARKK) was around 140 (down from 160 high) which now slid to 110 this week in May.

She said in that CNBC interview ""Nothing has changed but the price"" and now expects 25-30% YoY compounded returns in next 5 years.

So by simple math 

140*(1.15^5) = 281 back then

Now she's promising : between

110*(1.25^5) = 335

and 110*(1.3^5) = 408

That's almost 20-50% higher but if nothing has changed then how does the number grow so much more in end result ? I don't follow the math or logic here.

Also, let's say give here benefit of doubt and say back in February she meant ARK price numbers that were in Jan 21 for YoY growth of 15% but then price was even lower between 120-140. So I don't know if she's bluffing (I'm gonna guess saving her skin and fund outflows) and taking us for a ride or is she really onto something that we don't know ?

If nothing has changed but the price then how does your model give these numbers ? Am I to assume these companies are growing faster than ever that their prices will skyrocket even faster ? Is there any proof ?"

2021-05-08 12:39:03,stocks,"I realized some of Cathie Wood's projections are full of wishful thinking when I saw the justifications for $4000 PT for Tesla by 2026.

Wood forecasts $327 billion revenue (with high margin) from fully autonomous ride-hailing service by 2025.

I don't think even Elon Musk believes we will have fully autonomous cars by 2025 at this point.

This is what Elon Musk tweeted on April 29, 2021...

[https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1387901003664699392](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1387901003664699392)

""A major part of real-world AI has to be solved to make unsupervised, generalized full self-driving work, as the entire road system is designed for biological neural nets with optical imagers""

He is basically saying the road infrastructure has to be designed in a way which makes it easier for sensors to understand their environment or AI has to get much better before full autonomy becomes a reality. Regardless of his opinion on road systems and how to get to full autonomy , the realization that we are far away from full autonomy is embedded in his tweet.

Uber and Lyft have already thrown the towel on developing fully autonomous cars in-house and sold their AV business units after spending loads of money on this.

Given: Company projections \~10% YoY

Bean Counter: If I leverage 1 hour out of every day and assume that I gain 0.1% every time because I can post-influence sheep to follow me then sell into them leaving them pre-holding the bag.... thats an extra 5%... Now we report this as expected pre-income to pre-collateralize it via intra-margin without actually incurring a margin by pre-day trading.

Then carry it over to the corporate projections graph using a thick sharpie making the pre-projection have a standard deviation of another 2%. Now I can go talk to my pre-college post-grad data analyst to turn this plan into a recursive function that we keep as a trade secret. Now we iterate two more times.

Now that gives us a ceiling of 31% yoy pre-gains... but we cant have a ""1"" in the single digits because that will seem like a double buttcheek rimjob pattern, so lets post-floor it to 30%.

BAM - 30% yoy projections!

I still think all of the news in the investing/business world is interesting in a ""I'm not going to do that"" frame of mind.

All of the reading about finance and investing that I've done up to this point results in a cautionary tale about money managers in that they can have a stellar year or two, but it's about the eventual reversion to the mean. The top money manager one year is usually not the top dawg the next year. It's not sustainable.

Maybe Cathie Wood had a good run in the recent past. Maybe we're witnessing the decline that happens in this stratosphere. Maybe she'll turn it around and be the best money manager person in the history of the world. Who knows. I plan on watching the news to see how it turns out.

I was just literally reporting the news. That's still allowable isn't it? Or is that cancelled out too? SMH...

BTW you wouldn't happen to be ""a major ARKK bag holder"" would you? Ouch...

If it makes you feel better, I have been eyeing ARKK for a while now. I just haven't impulsively bought it yet because everytime I check in on it, it goes down further. I have bought and sold (and made a decent profit) from a few of the stocks that ARKK contains. It's one of the most interesting ETFs out there. And I have no doubt that it will turn around.

Please note that I am making my points of discussion here without personal attacks and without vulgarity. Except for my usage of AF. LOL."

They didn't return the key on the last day so the owner went to the property on the 30th day to find that they were still there and executing 'squatters rights'... I think it was Tennessee and if someone is in a property for at least 30 days they are considered tenants and the only way to get them out is to go through the eviction process... which takes another 30 days from the time they're served.  So at a minimum you have good-for-nothings living rent free for a month and probably utterly destroying/sh*tting on your hard earned investment the entire time.

2021-05-08 00:00:00,stocks,"The perfect portfolio anxiety. ***TL;DR*** *- The anxiety that comes with putting a lot of your hard-earned money on the line, especially when you're new to this.  Consider this something of a vent and me sharing my thoughts.  I think it's a good read but hey I'm biased.*

Hey guys,

I want to share about one of the emotional issues of investing that I'm sure many of you can relate to, even if it's not talked about much around here.  I wasn't sure about sharing this, but I figured I would because I think it's important, important for me, and like I said, I imagine for others, too, even if we don't usually talk about it.

I've been investing in a Roth IRA for a few years now, but this February marked my first foray into more extensive investing.  I was sitting on a lot of cash thanks to stimulus, less consumption thanks to Covid, and other reasons, and decided now was the time to put it to work.  I got into individual stocks because of GME.  Sometimes I'm kind of ashamed to say it, because there seems to be a negative stigma attached to that, and you know what? I understand why: the meme stock thing can be anywhere from facepalm to totally cringeworthy.  I share that opinion in some ways.  But at the same time I think that moment brought a lot of young folks into the market who actually have taken the time to learn about it and get serious, and I think that's wonderful.

February 2021 was a bad time for a lot of us to get into the market, because a lot of us tried chasing performance in things like ARK funds.  I understand a lot of people got nailed.  Luckily, I was cautious about getting in tech after such a crazy bull run, and I started out quite defensively.  I haven't lost money yet.  I'm slightly up.

But man, I've rebalanced... twice now.  I mean, the initial portfolio, then a complete overhaul, followed by another complete overhaul today. There's been innumerable minor tweaks and adjustments along the way, too.  In theory, my allocations have gotten better as I've gone along.  My second portfolio definitely made more sense than my first, but after this last readjustment I'm left thinking ""what the hell did I even bother to change for?""   What I have now isn't bad, I think, but I'm not sure it's really better than what I had before.  It might even be worse.  I'll have to chew it over a bit.

That's the thing.  Honestly, I feel a bit overwhelmed.  I could just make a rule ""alright, what's done is done"", but that's not the best idea, either.  Sometimes things do change.  Sometimes there are better plays.  We learn and what not.  So I don't feel comfortable making a rule about not making any changes, and if I did make a rule, I'd probably break it anyway.

I don't know what to do anymore.  Totally clueless.  Go back to the old allocation?  Keep things as they are?  Wait and see?  I'm leaning towards wait and see.  Just get this stuff of my chest.  Ride the market a little more and keep an open mind.

It's the uncertainty that kills me, man.  Can I afford to bet a good portion of my money on the entire market (ie: VTI?)  Would it be better to hold cash right now?  What about inflation?  How about individual stocks? What if my pick underperforms or goes bankrupt?  There's always black swan events.  And what about my future?  Where will I be in 10 years?  I wish I had all the answers, but I don't.  Nobody knows.  And that can be frustrating.

One last note.  I know people are going to say ""just do index funds and be done with it"".   I already do them - that's all I have in my Roth IRA.  They're a wonderful idea; I get why people love them.  That said, the portfolio I'm talking about here is in a taxable account and it's money I may need in the mid-term.  I'm young, and my future is uncertain.  I don't know if I'm going to need to buy a house soon, or a car, or go back to school.  I have a job but the pay isn't anything to write home about, and it's not necessarily something that I'll be able to do until I retire.  I think a lot of young people can relate.

Yes, I've got my 6-12 months in cash, and I've even got a tier 2 savings fund in series I bonds (inflation protected, check 'em out).  But still.

I don't want to just sit on cash, especially since cash sucks right now.  I want to put that extra money to work, and make some returns, even if they're modest. But at the same time I don't want my whole portfolio to go crashing down 50% suddenly.  I lost the link, if someone has it please let us know, but there's this great website that shows you how your portfolio (in dollar value, not actual allocations) would have been affected in different crashes (dot com bubble, 2008, etc.)  In 2008 a portfolio would decline over 50%, IIRC, and it would take 5 years and 5 months to recover.   Great, right?  Buy and hold.  Long-term time horizon.

Yeah, that's acceptable if you're 30 years old and saving for retirement.  But for me, it's absolutely unacceptable if I need that money to put a down payment on a house in the next 3-5 years.  You see?

I wish people would be a bit more open-minded when it comes to constantly recommending index funds.  Like I said, I think they're a wonderful idea - probably the best for retirement.  But at the same time every case is different, and every market is different.  Totally wonderful to recommend them, but maybe the downvoting and criticism needs to be cut back a bit.  Dialogue would be nice.  Comprehension. Not everyone has the same goals, needs, or time horizons.  We're all learning here, and nobody has the definitive answer for anyone's financial situation, especially not for yours.

Anyway, that's all guys.  Love to hear your thoughts, feelings, and feedback.  All the best and good luck to everyone."

I do believe it will be a better performer than the S&P 500 going forward. Time will tell. I am willing to make it one of my larger positions in my port for long term. Its turned the corner from a company that people kept wondering for years when they are going to make money. But it's just my opinion.

This is a somewhat unusual situation but it can come up.  It's something they warn you about if you are an option seller who has sold an option that is about to expire in the money.  You might be surprised by the option being exercised before expiration if there is an upcoming dividend."
2021-05-08 00:00:00,stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, May 7, 2021 **PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, May 7, 2021**

Keeping up with current volatility, the stock market jumped up today to new records, with the S&P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) reaching fresh intraday records, driven higher by a swift reversal to the upside by tech-stocks. Market participants continue to digest corporate earnings reports and the disappointing April Jobs Report, which showed the US economy added fewer jobs than expected even despite the easing of social distancing guidelines. 

The Labor Department showed that the US only brought back 266,000 jobs for the month of April, far less than the gain of at least 1 million that was originally expected and a big deceleration from the numbers seen in March. The unemployment rate unexpectedly increased to 6.1%, widening further from its pre-pandemic level of 3.5%. 

This new economic data serves to bolster the argument that monetary officials have been making that, despite significant progress, the labor market remains well below pre-pandemic levels and that more support from the Central Bank is needed to bolster the momentum of the recovery. Altogether, the US remains roughly 8.2 million jobs short compared to pre-pandemic levels, and both the unemployment rate and labor force participation remains well below January 2020.

In the past, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has suggested the Central Bank wants to see a ‚Äústring‚Äù of strong labor market gains totalling more than 1 million before any adjustment to the current policy is made. With the April report disappointing, it appeared the labor market remains far below the Central Bank targets, meaning it is unlikely to change its current accommodative policy anytime soon.

Seema Shah, Chief Strategist at Principal Global Investors said, ‚ÄúThe smaller rise in payrolls should at least assuage some concerns around the Fed policy outlook. As we have heard several times in recent days, even a very strong jobs number wouldn‚Äôt have caused the committee to formally discuss changing the pace of bond purchases, so today‚Äôs number certainly won‚Äôt be giving the Fed cause for concern. They will be in no rush to bring forward tapering plans.""

**Highlights**

* The weak April jobs report catalyzed a rebound in technology names Friday morning, with the disappointing data easing fears that the Federal Reserve will adjust their policies in the near-term.
* Moderna (MRNA) posted a profit for the first time for Q1 2021, bolstered by revenue brought from the coronavirus vaccine. 
* ROKU and Square (SQ) both gapped up today after blowing past analyst estimates in their earnings report.
* Amid mounting pressure from antitrust regulators, e-commerce giant Alibaba Group offloaded its entire stake in a real estate trading platform, retreating from a new business for which it once held high hopes.
* IBM introduced what it says is the world's first 2-nanometer chip making technology. The technology could be as much as 45% faster than the mainstream 7-nanometer chips in many of today's laptops and phones and up to 75% more power efficient, the company said.

2021-05-08 00:00:00,stocks,"Why does Amazon not want to split their stock? One share of AMZN costs 3.300$. What could be the reason why Amazon does not want to split their stock?

On the other side, Apple and Tesla are also among the most valuable companies in the world and they did a stock split only a few months ago- what could be the reason they decided to split their stock?"

Back in the day when you could only buy whole shares and pay $7, $10, or $25+ per trade, having a lower share price could be beneficial.

Now, not a big deal when you can just buy however many dollars worth of Amazon that you want at Schwab or Fidelity (I assume other large brokerages will follow suit eventually)."

2021-05-08 04:49:16,stocks,"For a while  Iasked this question since starting in January, I asked this question myself. 

But upon learning more about all the ways a stock's price can be affected, trading, and above all looking at Apple's stock price, I start to understand why they don't want to do that. Keeping the price that high does 2 things. 

1. It attracts SERIOUS investors. When you finally commit and manage to own entire shares of a stock that expensive, it really discourages you from wanting to sell them for a while. Folks with a lot of cash will see the price and AMZN's success and decide to commit to buy a few shares and holding them for ages themselves. This helps its price continue to rise and rise. 

2. It discourages trading and options manipulation. Cheaper stocks are easier to flip. It can bolster volume and price short term but long term it just makes it harder for your stock to consistently build value. Look at Apple. For months it's been having hard time getting its price to hold and I think it's relatively sheep 130ish price is part of the problem. Look at how much talk you see of folks buying options on FAAMG stocks. Notice how you see Apple calls appear way more often. It's largely cause their price is much cheaper than their contempories which makes it more inviting for retail and institutions alike to fool around with price as they see fit. Eventually APPL should push past this but it'll probably be a while before they get enough folks to diamond it at these cheap prices.

To make an anecdote, my brother who starterd day trading during college break last summer would frequently tell me about how he would like to flip APPL for easy bucks around earnings or news times. By contrast, one of my more serious investing family members has committed to buying a batch of AMZN shares and holding them for years and years. And I myself am trying to gradually work my way to a full share. It may not be a full share but seeing how much 1 is worth makes me want to keep building my way up and not just casually flip it.

A higher price simply makes a stock more consistent."

Highly unlikely for the stock to have huge moves. If it does lose something like $15 in a day it can just be shrugged off. To a $50 dollar stock however, that would be a disaster. Viacom is a good example. $100 in March, now $40. Amazon going from 3100 to 3000 would be noticed, but it would have to do that many more times to cause concerns."

I wanted to buy a stock that was considered undervalued by many people, but it was a few days before its earnings date. I didn't want to gamble on earnings, as the price might have gone up or down 5-10%, so I just waited until their announcement. As it turns out, they beat earnings, and its price went up 5-10%. I kept waiting for its price to get a correction, but for the past week, it's literally gone up about 1-2% everyday for the last 5 days since they announced earnings.

It's now up about 10-12% from when I first wanted to buy it. It's not a tech stock and actually considered more of a ""boomer"" stock, so it might not go to the moon like a tech stock. It's still undervalued at this point, but its upside has gotten smaller after going up 10-12% already.

Its price was largely flat and boring for this year, so the 10-12% jump in price looks sort of unusual. I'm a bit worried if I buy now, it will start correcting since its price has basically just kept going up, but, then again, it might not correct since it's considered undervalued.

Pick the share price you believe is what you want to pay and that you‚Äôd be willing to pay, make sure you have enough cash in your account to cover the purchase of 100 shares at the strike price you pick, sell the put for that strike price with whatever expiration date you want.

Easy peasy. 

There‚Äôs nothing to be scared of with a cash secured put.

Your brokerage will basically take the cash out of your trading pool so if it exercises it‚Äôs covered (sort of like when you get a cashiers check from the bank and they basically pull the cash when they draft the check).

If it never gets exercised you keep the premium, the cash gets freed up and you can buy other stuff or sell another put.

If it does exercise you still keep the premium and you get 100 shares of a stock that you wanted at a price you think/thought is fair.

If it‚Äôs a stock you ultimately want to own and a price you believe is fair, there‚Äôs really not much downside to selling cash secured puts.

In short, it seems like the entire tech sector went out of favor for the last quarter. But... if there's a turnaround in the segment, they have some good lights ahead of them. 

TL;DR - Why I'm invested in them. I really do like the company. I'm big into these guys. Maybe with GME's PC Sales push, that'll shine some light on CRSR. Maybe they'll get bought out by MSFT or AMZN who wants a more substantial play into the gaming and streaming market. Not sure, but I'm long on the stock with XXXX shares. 

**Positions**:

*  XXXX shares
* Dec 17 2021 $35C

# Good Stuff

**1) Cash flow from operating activities** (their core product) is increasing YoY and QoQ. This is really good and healthy. 

**2) Inventory turnover** (how many times a company sells its entire inventory stock) has been growing double digit %s for the past four years. That means that people want CRSR's product. But maybe CRSR is leaving money on the table because they're constantly out of stock?

**3) Financial stability** \- they have solid growth in their free cash flow. Their quick ratio is < 1 which is not great, but their current ratio is > 1 which is good (quick = if they had to liquidate everything today, could they cover their debt ... current = are they being hamstrung by debt payments (no they are not)). 

**4) Stock value** \- they've given up 33% of their value from 3 months ago. This entire past quarter (for almost the entire tech market it seems) has been a massive haircut. They're consolidating around the low $30s - which if the tech market turns around should be a really healthy thing for CRSR. 

# Okay Stuff

**5) Branding** \- these guys are operating in a very fragmented space. They're doing the right things with branding, but in the market overall, they're still very much an unheard of name. They're kind of like how Sonos was almost 10 years ago. If Corsair can find a way to get more into the mainstream, then they're golden.  

**6) Leadership -** this is the only iffy thing I see with them. They have a solid stack of leadership, but nothing really strikes me as a notable in terms of them pushing for bigger / greater things. As I mentioned before CRSR plays in an ultra-fragmented industry. Sure the big streamers and maybe most of you here know about the name, but a vast majority of people don't. Leadership needs to change this. Point in case, more ppl know about CRSR from streaming and reddit than from anything that leadership is really doing. Grassroots matters, but more is needed to go from early adopters to mainstream market."

So when you buy a call option you are buying a contract with the ""Right but not the obligation"" to buy the stock at the strike price but you aren't actually buying the stock.

So IF GME went up to $805 before the expiration date the value if you sold the option the profit would not be huge, it would be it would only be a few dollars per share"

So far I've found that CCI, ADX and ADL are very helpful for daytrading for me and I've noticed that I'm making better decisions based on them - it's so much easier to see the trend and momentum with them. I've also found EMA clouds and trying to integrate them in my analysis, but I'm still not sure if I understand their purpose correctly.

Currently, I've got the following EMA's: 5-13, 34-50, 72-79, but I'm not sure how useful they are for given timeframes, meaning is 5-13 cloud better on 1 minute chart or 5 minute chart? I've seen stocks finding support on the top or bottom of the the same cloud, but one would do it on a 5 minute chart, the other on 1 minute chart.

Is there any general rule to follow here or maybe each pattern is different and I should find the timeframe that correlates with these clouds the best?

Another question is a bit more simple, but I need a confirmation - are tops and bottoms of these clouds treated as additional support levels?

Thanks for all the help and answers in advance."

2021-05-08 02:58:57,stocks,"The reason lab grown meat will never sell at price parity with regular meat (in a capitalist society) is quite simple. Briefly: opportunity cost.

Anyone who can mass produce synthetic tissues for meat can also produce synthetic tissues for biomedical reasons. So why would they sell it at price parity with regular meat, which is (in comparison) dirt cheap? Pharma has huge margins. Food has nearly nonexistent margins.

Hoping for there to ever be economical lab grown meat is like expecting gold miners to suddenly start selling shirts made of spun gold at price parity with cotton shirts.

Under what circumstances would this thesis fail to hold up?

1. A society in which medicine is simply not a for-profit industry, and where mass production of lab grown meat is simply mandated as a matter of course by the state in response to environmental catastrophe.
2. A society in which the externalities of the traditional meat production industry are taxed out of existence. This would be deeply unpopular and to the extent it resulted in lab grown and real meat having price parity, it would only be because the real meat has become so much more expensive."
2021-05-07 21:05:12,stocks,so the burger broke your heart?
2021-05-08 07:15:24,stocks,"> there's really no good evidence it is necessarily healthier for you than regular meat

How the debate is framed is part of the branding. Comparing Beyond Meat only to ‚Äúregular meat‚Äù, meaning beef, excludes things that actually are healthier like turkey burgers or veggie burgers filled with actual vegetables. In the same way, comparing electric vehicles only to regular vehicles excludes the possibility that people could just walk, bike and take public transportation everywhere.

Your point is essentially correct but I think there are least more positive outcomes possible if people buy into this branding. If people have the expectation your products are going to be healthy then you have to deliver at least to some extent. Vitamin Water does come in zero sugar which is healthier than the full sugar one."
2021-05-08 07:27:08,stocks,The name of the company is ‚ÄúBeyond Meat‚Äù so obviously they can go beyond meat alternatives and acquire a beverage company or open restaurants. That‚Äôs the way to look at it in the long term. It‚Äôs a flexible brand.

Anyone auto manufacturer can make a car luxurious. It's just going to cost more and have less of a market. Tesla's goal is 20M cars a year. That doesn't come from making luxury cars.

Profits come from high volume and high margins. Tesla>VW when it comes to EV. And profits is a bigger stock price mover than some cherry picked number in one European country. The car market is a global market. Remember, this is /r/stocks, not /r/GermanyAutoMarket

If people are still in love with petrol/gas in 2030, I'll bet on VW, if people accept BEVs as their primary vehicle in 2030, I'm betting on TSLA.

VW will still succeed, but remember, this is /r/stocks. I'm looking for growth. Legacy auto transitioning to EV looks like more debt and lower margins to me.

VW and all other legacy auto manufacturer are cannibalizing themselves gaining ground in EV and losing ground on ICE. Tesla is only growing.

And to comment on the article. The mainstream media love Tesla. Divisiveness fuels profits. Mainstream media and wallsteet have something else in common. They love the short term. They live for the short term. If it can't be traded on in a day, it's not worthy. Some retail investors are fed up buying into their BS. We're going to buy and hold TSLA."

It's really the share price they are disgusted at. The belief other people have that this company can grow without failing.

The upside is real, and there are plenty of people who've done their DD, made it public, and are willing to take that risk. Then there are those who are too scared to put their money on projections and numbers without substance.

People just want to see TSLA priced in for today, so they can be happy to buy in. They hate the idea of paying the high multiple. They are insulted that their favorite legacy auto doesn't and will never deserve a high multiple."

VW and ALL the other automakers **have** to shift to making only EV's overtime due to declining EV costs and government regulations, if they don't then they'll be out of business before the decade ends. What do you think is going to happen to the ICE sales of automakers like VW who successfully transition to EVs? It'll be shifted into EV sales.

What really matters to Tesla and VW is how many cars will they be selling globally when everyone has transitioned to EVs. If VW is hypothetically only selling half as many cars as they used to post-EV transition I don't think VW investors are going to care if they're still selling more vehicles then Tesla. If Tesla is selling 10 million EV's a year in 2025 I don't think Tesla shareholders are going to care that Tesla is only producing 20% of the EV market.

Tesla has an advantage of not having to deal with ICE vehicles and dealer system.

As far i know their new structural battery pack design packs an 500kg battery and the weight savings of the whole structural design is around -200 kg and will increase it structural integrity of the vehicle. Compared to others who use pouch design or module designs basicly carrying extra weight around which will look outdated as soon Tesla Berlin will start delivering.

Based on what?  I also read the technical paper that you posted.  It is a joke right??  Basing a livable wage on household number?  You get paid for the work YOU do.

I would think that if all you could find isn't paying enough at 40 hours you would find a 2nd job to fill in the gap.  There is 168 hours in a week.  Getting 8 hours of sleep a day leaves 112 hours of time.  I am not saying you need to work all of them, but even a 2nd part time job gets you 60-70 hours a week until you can find a better paying job.  I have worked 80+ hours a week many times to get some extra money.  A wage is based on the number of people capable of doing the job.  So if you work in a field where workers are a dime a dozen then the wage is based on that.  It has nothing to do with the difficulty of the work.  Never has.

why would I would any amount of hours for any other person, If it is not enough to live comfortably on? I do not want to live a shitty life where I drudge day in day out making other people a ton of money, while I slum it up and work harder than they do. It doesn't matter how many hours you can work, you are being taken advantage of for every single hour you work. every hour you are working, you are being scammed out of the difference of what you deserve to be paid, and what you are actually being paid. 

Also, have you ever worked an 80 hour week? Because I can show you 4 weeks in a row at 80 hours a week that I worked for ups, during the holiday season. Let me tell you, I do not want to do that ever again. I do not want to piss in a bottle, or be forced to eat fast food because that is the only option, because you've been out so long that your sandwich went rancid? It really sucked. It paid proper as well, and I got my ass out of debt. however, that is only because it paid good. I am talking specifically about 7.25 an hour jobs, that will not let you get overtime btw. you couldnt ask them to give you 70 hours, because they would fire you. that means you would have to get a second job. in which case you would be working overtime technically, but not for the same company, so you would not be getting paid overtime. Now, this was  probably the biggest mistake I have ever made in my whole life. see when I was 18 I thought like you. I said maaaan im going to work real hard, save up money for college, and everything will be great! I got two jobs, at a burger king and a kfc, because they called me back INSTANTLY. they called me back so quick, I didnt even get to hear the other offers because I took these jobs so fast. I started working 30 hours at one, and 40 at the other. Then I looked at my paycheck. I realized I was making 16k a year. there was no shot I would be able to get ahead. I was working two jobs, and still having to take out credit cards just to buy groceries! which I never had time to cook, because I worked too much. living wage is 28k a year for a reason, it costs that much to live, and if you dont make that much, you go into debt for the difference. Fuck being able to pay for school and better myself, I dont have time or money for that because I fucked up and let myself get scammed by these fucking wage slavers. 

so lets be honest, you go work your ass off, hands to the bones, kys with work, and never get ahead, i dont give a fuck. Id rather be a meth head out in a tent in the woods than live your idea of a good life."

That said, while I have done a lot of consulting in my career, the medical field is something I'm a bit light on so I'll have to provide this as generic advice, but most advice in the medical industry is going to need to be tailored to what specialty you are in anyway because the needs of one are drastically different than another.

The best thing you could likely do is leverage technology to automate every process that can be.  I've been told insurance coding is very complex, but if you can provide proper tools to whoever handles that portion of your business you can ensure that you are utilizing them to their full capacity.  Personally, I think the entire insurance industry is a sham, it adds layers upon layers of paperwork to force healthcare providers to justify the care they give patients, all while employing people on both ends to churn that paperwork adding additional cost.

Even that is something that I have heard of some providers innovating to address.  Forming private physician groups with private insurance that drastically cuts the costs for the patient who then only needs to carry a major emergency plan for things that fall outside the physician group's capacity.  There are things that can be done, you just need to think outside the box.  If the way everyone else is doing things isn't working for you, then determine why that is and what you can do different so it will."
2021-05-07 22:29:55,stocks,"It is illegal to form a private physician group with private insurance as it would be considered as physicians colluding and even in best case scenario it would mean those physicians were cut off from accepting any other patients.

Even the ‚Äúair puff‚Äù machine at your optometrist office can run 20-25k or more. Yes, health insurance as it stands in the United States is a total sham and a mockery.

GaN's have a dislocation desnity of 10^8 - 10^10 defects/cm^2. This translates too a much higher ratio of dead chips. 

It's not that its impossible to use other substrates than silicon, just more expensive. In a competetive space where silicon is still seeing massive returns on investment, there is not much room for a new contender to show up, and without the decades of development."

You have a total of $100K you can contribute into an IRA over your career.   After a few decades, the IRA balance grows times 10 with the investment fund you choose. 

Two scenarios:  With a Ross, you contributed a total of $75K into the account $25k to the government in taxes.  Over the years, the balance is times ten from your gains $750K.  You can do whatever you want now it's tax free. 

With a Traditional, you put in all of the $100K because there's no upfront taxes.  Your account, in the same investment, grows times ten.   You have $1,000,000.   Over the years, you pay 12% as you take it out.   So you actually have $880K. 

If you want to perform hedonistic behavior (and I do too), just use a regular brokerage account. 

Roth was invented to give the federal government a way to get its revenue early.  If you are going to make more money after retirement, then Roth is the best choice.  That's pretty rare though.

2021-05-08 03:23:53,stocks,"I used portfolio visualizer + forbes fortune 500 largest global companies list to get the top 10  for each decade and simulated against the vanguard sp500 portfolio.

From a 10k investment i used portfolios of top 4, 5 & 10 holdings of the top 10 biggest (market cap).

 For 90-99 portfolio i selected toyota, walmart, coca cola, procter and gamble, johnson and johnson, at&t, pfizer, mcdonalds, Microsoft, berkshire Hathaway

For 2000-09 I used pfizer, walmart, nestle, at&t, coca cola, johnson and johnson, toyota, Berkshire Hathaway, Procter and gamble, jp morgan

For 2010-19 i used industrial bank of China, apple, microsoft, Berkshire Hathaway, walmart, nestle, Procter and gamble, at&t, johnson and johnson, jp Morgan

The best performing portfolio was a top 10 holding, which increased a 10k investment in 1990 to 857k in 2019, averaging a 15.99% return/p.a.

The second best was a top 4 holding, returning 14.4% p.a, growing to 572k from 10k.

The third best was the top 5 holding, returning 13.9% p.a, and growing 10k to 495k

These returns crushed the sp500 which returned roughly 144k from 10k, with a 9.3% p.a return.

Per decade the sp500 returned 17.93%, -1.01%, and 11.85% respectively. The best performing portfolio returned per decade, 32.37%, 3.78%, and 13.62%. 

Imo the top 4 holding is actually best performing as it out performs the other 3 portfolios over the 2000s & 2010s. The top 10 portfolio just happened to have a wicked first decade growing 10k to 165k. The top 4 portfolio returned 22.81%, 4.58%, and 16.71% respectively for each decade.

This is not financial advice SEC. Suck my balls.

Edit: i got the idea for this after watching the swedish investor video on investing in the richest people. I thought it would be more logical to invest in the biggest and greatest companies. I think 2020s are gonna be the most i interesting as we're looking at almost an entirely new top 10 that we havent sen before"

Arguments can be made that it's not heavy enough into bonds for her presumed age but likely doesn't matter. He probably sees no need in anything more than that, and likely she could cash out her entire investment account and still be fine. Warren speaks broadly of index fund approaches. For most people looking to invest for their eventual day when they can no longer work, and don't bother with knowing about all the companies this approach is just fine. While not for everyone, it is for most. What warren would do with his company does not mean that everyone should do it. This is my opinion of it anyways."

2021-05-07 21:37:31,stocks,"I am wondering the same things.

Most recently I have cut down on a lot of my speculative stocks and honestly, I just went with VTI and SCHG. 

I have kept TAN and ICLN but today I cut ICLN out as I was sort of even with it and put the money into VTI.

The reason I did all this was that I realized I am not good with too much volatility, and trying to rebalance my portfolio. Honestly, I think VTI is just a well-balanced ETF, it may not give stellar results like (i.e. invest in Netflix when it was worth 2$... etc) 

I have been asking myself this same thing, should I keep TAN.

I am a huge believer in alternative energy.

My cost avg is 83$ and I have sold CC into June for a 95 strike.

The problem with TAN is most of its largest holdings have a very high valuation. 

However, I do think that if Congress passes the infrastructure bill, the EV stuff will go up again.

The interest rates should not scare investors too much but this seems to have been the catalyst for selling.

I guess i have to wonder if TAN can beat VTI in the next 10-20 years. I am not so sure as I think a lot of the potential is already priced in but would love to hear what others have to say, if it cannot then I do not see the point of keeping TAN and just go with VTI (I think avg return is around 10% per year if not more, and I am sure if VTI goes down TAN will go down way more)."

I would most likely consider selling covered calls above my cost average, if the price of the stock fell below my higher entry point by a good margin. The premium is better, while still being above my average cost, but not necessarily above my highest cost. Maybe the premium on the higher strike is very little. In this case the cost average would be relevant and useful for picking a strike."
2021-05-08 02:06:54,stocks,"Amazon was considered overvalued because at the time they just sold books online... At the time there was no talk about retailing everything and certainly there were competitors.

Google was also unpredictable because at the time we had about a dozen search engines competing and it was unclear which one would be the winner. Any argument made for Google could have applied to the others so in reality, you had less than 10% chance of getting it right.

For example, you had, hotbot, altavista, google, excite, quil, aol, kart, infoseak, and I am sure I am missing 2-3 other plus established stuff like yahoo.

So now consider what would have happened to an ETF that bought all these other failed ventures? Granted in 20 years, it probably would have been profitable but thats a long wait and it assumes stock markets continues its valuation increases. What if valuation goes sideways or... gasp... goes back to old averages?

Further ARK didnt buy these companies when they were young. A huge portion of their buys are of companies that were already run up a ton. Thus upside is actually far more limited than say a ETF that only buys IPO's of small to mid caps."

2021-05-08 00:41:43,stocks,"I'm thinking 1 year :)

&#x200B;

Picked up EPD in March 2021 and HUN in April 2021, so add 12 months to that.

&#x200B;

I tend to do a deep dive on my stocks when they consist of 1% my portfolio. After 4% I take very seriously, follow earnings calls etc. HUN and a handful of others slightly under 4% I also keep a close eye on as I plan to push them above 4%.

&#x200B;

List of those stocks below, and portfolio weighting, as of close 8th May. Happy to discuss any of them, brief summary of each:

&#x200B;

**¬£ Hollywood Bowl:** 8.35% (Love this company, branding, numbers (pre-Covid), great management, solid track record and steady growth (also pre-Covid)

**$ Microsoft:** 6.00% (It's just a great company doing well)

**$ BMY:** 5.36% (Obviously dissapointing results, but cancer and will recover, plus solid looking pipeline at fairly advanced stages)

**$ AT&T:** 4.67% (I'm bullish and like what I see, from wireless to HBO)

**$ EPD:** 4.56% (defensive and divi)

**¬£ Games Workshop:** 4.52% (crazy margins, great CEO / management, expansion possibilities, lore on point. It's up 23x over 5 years with divi reinvested, 18x without, it's a monster that'll be in the FTSE100 end of 2023, likely sooner)

**¬£ Sage Group:** 4.23% (bit un-noticed but does HR / payroll / finance and is well diversified and underloved. Legacy tech but I like it, divi and buybacks)

**¬£ Fevertree Drinks:** 3.8% (convinced this company will be a monster, and maybe like Monster. Original a tonic specialist for Gin's, it's targeting both international and other mixers. Market over-reacted to decent results considering Covid, and I opened a sizeable position).

**$ CACI International:** 3.77% (also a bit unnoticed, it's a software meets military company. No divi, and they are quite clear they have no intention of it, but winning contracts and very deeply ingrained with US Gov / military

**$ HBAN**: 3.76% (regional US bank digesting an acquisition. I like the direction. Recent numbers were so-so and dipped to $14.50, which is was a chance for me to add 80% to my previous holding).

**$ HUN:** 3.2% (as discussed) :)"
2021-05-08 00:10:56,stocks,"Personally I think EPD is more undervalued currently, and it has that juicy divi too. It was much closer but HUN has increased 10% since that divi increase was announced and I think it made the market notice.

&#x200B;

I have 3% of my portfolio in HUN and 5% in EPD, and it's more EPD I'm buying at current levels as I am hoping the excitement will wear off post divi for HUN and I can pick up some more shares under $30 :)

&#x200B;

But I think the divi growth and longer term you could argue HUN. I really think their strategy and approach is correct, it's rare I find an industrial I'm excited about, and I've personally always preferred earnings over revenue, much more important to me, and it's really improving there. How they use their war chest and available lending facilities will be key, so I'm trying to keep a close eye on them as I do feel they have the potential to be a forever hold for me. A near 2.5% yield and then a 15% divi increase is pretty decent. 

&#x200B;

I have a $27.00 end of Mar 2022 target for EPD and a $36 end of Apr 2022 target for HUN. I'm averaged at $23.10 for EPD and $28.51 for HUN currently."
