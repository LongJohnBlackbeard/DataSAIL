03/13/2021,stocks,Looks like there was two stock splits after 1988 as well
03/13/2021,stocks,"Put that fucker in a waterproof bag, and stick that bag in a secure, fireproof safe **right fucking now.** Then do as others have suggested and contact investor relations. You’re likely sitting on early retirement.

EDIT - Damn. From your other comments, you had a rough go of things. I’m glad your grandparents looked out for you and it seems they may not have finished yet."
03/13/2021,stocks,"That’s worth over $250,000 USD"
03/13/2021,stocks,"well my friend that certificate is worth roughly a quarter mil. 6722 shares at fridays closing price 36.96.

thank your grandparents if you can keep it (after you pay the taxes on it of course)

congrats!"
03/13/2021,stocks,Call your broker. They can get it registered in your name and add it to your account. Unless it was left to someone else in their wills or other transfer documents.
03/13/2021,stocks,"Cash it with your broker, and YOLO everything into GME.

(Don't actually do that, unless you don't mind losing most of that 250K)"
03/13/2021,stocks,Contact the investor relations of the company. They should be able to help you convert it to digital. It's worth 6722*37 dollars.
03/13/2021,stocks,So with the two splits the shares have been reduced twice in that time? What a terrible investment.

03/13/2021,stocks,"I think it means you hold 4x as many shares because of two 2:1 splits, looks like about a mill $ worth of shares to me. Congrats"
03/13/2021,stocks,No that’s the opposite... you have more shares than written in this paper!
03/13/2021,stocks,No it means the 7k shares are much more now. Edit: gib dollar pls
03/13/2021,stocks,"FYI, you may have more shares than that by now depending on if, or how many times, the stock has split."
03/13/2021,stocks,I was actually going to yolo everything I had into GME when it took its last dip to $50ish. I'm such a dipshit lol

03/13/2021,stocks,"A buddy of mine works for Apple and has a shit load of shares - if anything, you might find they have a share scheme like tax free or a small % off or something"
03/13/2021,stocks,The information you would have as a rank and file employee really wouldn't be enough to be considered insider information like board of directors and ceo level information.
03/13/2021,stocks,"No, or else companies wouldn’t be able to gift employees shares like Costco and many others do"
03/13/2021,stocks,"Different companies will have different rules about this. Many companies have ""trading windows"" that close near earnings time, so you aren't allowed to buy or sell company shares during that time. Many companies have policies against trading derivatives (options) on the company's stock.

These aren't laws, just company policies, which means you can't go to jail for breaking them - you just get fired if you're caught."
03/13/2021,stocks,"no, if you’re just a regular employee there’s no problem with owning their shares. lots of companies give their employees stocks, like tesla"
03/13/2021,stocks,Doesn’t make a difference. You are good to go.
03/13/2021,stocks,Exactly this. If you're a peon it doesn't matter. If you're a C level it's a way different story.
03/13/2021,stocks,"I'm not too familiar with Hindenburg before the CLOV short report but Citron has been coasting off their (correct) thesis on Valeant for several years. I remember he was trying to target Shopify, Nvidia, and Tesla but was wrong. Then got fucked on GME.

I think they split their things up into their legitimate convictions and then there's some backroom stuff going on where they target companies to give entry opportunities to, I guess other firms they have some affiliation with? Because a few months later they generally announce they close the short and announce they're out.

Then why not remain short indefinitely and ride it to zero since their thesis often amounts to accusations of outright fraud? If they're concerned with short squeezes it seems like they had longer to ride it down before covering. It's not some skepticism but accusation of outright fraud: in other words an all-or-nothing proposition. With SPACs the last 3 short reports are very heavy with insinuation and scare language. The common investor probably does not have a good familiarity with what a DoJ inquiry or affiliated parties among customers means - so the authors will maximize the sinister quality of it.

I'm seeing this with Triteras and with Phase2. I saw  a wave of funds file Form 13F on fintel which means that the institutions don't take the thesis seriously, because this was a month after the short presentation. Other longs researching this reached out directly to Phase2 asking for more info on the blockchain transactions to verify if the management's response was true and got angry reactions instead of providing it when it was in their best interest to do so. So waited to get in below $7, then boom Western Union partnership and it spikes to 8.00.

And there's also a bunch of smaller no name hedge funds on Twitter usually hopping on the bandwagon, also claiming to immediately cover their shorts way too soon if they actually believed they were correct. So it's just a part of the overall Stocktwits and media message and sentiment game.

So they're not necessarily enemies, they create tons of opportunities. With the TRIT timeline I got the chance to see how the smart money responded (by going long en masse, which I could publicly see on fintel in late Feb, not a secret at all), read the rebuttals and debates, and then I could follow, all before the rip up comes. It felt strange to have such a big window for a regular retail investor to grasp the situation and get in, like a free info arbitrage trade.  I think it's a pretty weak effort to keep people out, but if you wait a few months after SPACs IPO for the attack, seems like a great opportunity to swoop in with a lot more information. Of course if you're already in BEFORE the short attack it will suck.

However, with NKLA, Hindenburg was absolutely dead on. But the style of presentation is completely different. Brutally and fully destructive, scorched earth, every little sordid detail laid out (like the president of the battery company with the scam tech blowing the money on prostitutes lol). Meaning, they use all the ammunition and damning evidence they have: what does this imply when they don't? They resort to insinuation and 'hint hint' language when they lack it, which seems to be the case with CLOV. In the future I really think they're going to mix it up and make it less obvious, but right now they don't care since it's just a couple guys in specific communities that get to exploit them.

But SPAK did find a bottom recently, a few people called it correctly that I've been trading/investing with. The opinion I've seen is that we're going to look back at this time and won't be able to believe we got into all these companies at such cheap prices.

Whether intentional or not, this is trying to condition the savvy investor to not take part in SPACs immediately and wait for the short reports. I think there is truth to Wall Street despising the SPAC process for getting retail investors into IPOs so much cheaper.

Would love to see a compilation of all SPAC and short reports in the last say 5 years. There has to have been a study done on them."
03/13/2021,stocks,"That's not quite true, hindenburg in particular is very reputable and actually don't get it wrong to often, Citron doesn't do shorts anymore after gamestop, a particularly bad pharmaceutical company called valeant which was heavily backed by ackman, they called it out for its aggressive hiking of drug prices and illegal tactics."

03/13/2021,stocks,"EVRI, BCC, Paysafe, maybe ZNGA.

EVRI is an online/casino/fintech company. They provide casino floors with their slot machines and cash/reward/loyalty programs. They also have a small portfolio of online games/gambling. You can see some of the slot machines on their website. [The Willie Nelson machine is my favorite](https://www.everi.com/games/library/willie-nelson/). They also have a lot of current and past pop culture games which I can absolutely see being big in the casino space. I've been building a position slowly on dips, currently above pre covid levels which makes me a bit uneasy however. Slightly under mid cap value.

* [https://www.everi.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Everi-Holdings-Investor-Presentation-November-2020.pdf](https://www.everi.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Everi-Holdings-Investor-Presentation-November-2020.pdf)

BCC is my favorite mid cap play. Lumber prices increasing big time. Not enough supply yet due to forest fires and lower production due to covid. Should rocket for a while, also gets you exposure outside of tech. I built up a small position here at 49 dollars...a little sad it got away from me so fast. Paysafe is paysafe, I think slightly valued above traditional mid cap valuation, but not massive. These are really the only three companies I have in my portfolio that are in this range other than corsair which most people would not consider a sleeper. I don't see these companies growing faster than most large cap companies however, so I'm going to be ignoring adding to them and adding to PINS/AAPL. Curious to see what other people have their eye on however."

03/13/2021,stocks,"Too many, theoretically none, but a well diversified portfolio only needs about 20-30 stocks to protect you from unsystematic risk. Of course, systematic risk (market risk) can hit you no matter how diversified you are (covid, inflation, etc...). Once you start going beyond 30, you might as well be in ETFs."
03/13/2021,stocks,"It all depends on your own risk tolerance, I find that being heavily diversified the gains per year was slow as each sector fluctuates, for example company A can 2x and you think wow, but to your portfolio the rise could be very minimal because of the high diversification. 

When I first started I held around 25, but have since dwindled that number down, currently around 15-16 but my plan is to go to around 10-12. 

Plus who has the time to read up on 20+ companies each quarter? I can barely keep up with 10 as it is.

This is just me though."
03/13/2021,stocks,"How many companies/industries can you fully understand? That number is different for everyone, so there isn't a clear answer to your question. 

If you can't adequately explain a company you're invested in then you probably not an informed investor. 

For me personally, I rarely if ever have over 10 individual stocks in my portfolio. Right now that number is closer to 5."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Depends. If you learn about risk management traditionally/mathematically, then you're looking at 15-30 stocks that should be as diverse as possible; there's a model that found that after ~25 different stocks, the rate at which you decrease the risk (std. dev.) basically starts tapering off. The idea is that you're looking to hedge risk as much as possible while maximizing your returns.

However, how many people actually follow this? This kind of explanation relies on traders/investors being 100% rational and data-driven, which no one is. That's why there's a million different equations/theories as to how to manage your portfolio-- some will keep in mind your risk tolerance, personal preferences, etc. There isn't anything wrong with having >20 different stocks since it hedges risk, but it also minimizes your gain. It's a trade-off and it comes down purely to preference.

I will agree with the other commenter though. If you're looking at a ton of different sectors, it might be a good idea to start investing in ETFs instead. Unless you trade for a living, I feel like it's way too much time to do DD on each and every company."
03/13/2021,stocks,"No such thing as too many
Buy up all the stocks
Be your own master"
03/13/2021,stocks,"I tend to stay around 10 companies, but am very much a trader. I hold generally around 3 months maximum. It really just comes down to how many you are comfortable with. If you want to make a lot fast fewer is better, but you can drop fast also."
03/13/2021,stocks,"If you invest in more than about 3-5, then maybe focus on finding stocks that you have more confidence in to be able to hold only 2-3 or maybe 5."
03/13/2021,stocks,"I have 60+ and feel fine with it.  Some I pay attention to more than others, but I feel good about my diversification and exposure."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Are you trading, or buying and holding?  If you want to hold and be diverse, look at ETFs.  If you're trading, how many you can babysit is up to you."
03/13/2021,stocks,"I have 60 and keep adding to it. I want diversification but something more interesting than a mutual fund (I have some of Those too). I don’t have enough of any one stock to make exceptionally life changing gains, but also not life destroying losses. And I enjoy buying new stocks and watching them. If I like how one is doing I will average up or down on the position. Plenty of stocks I have 10-20 shares in and only a few I hold more than $2000 original investment.  It’s not the high risk get rich scheme many like, and I only average about like a good ETF or mutual fund,  but I’m relatively new to actively trading and prefer to work my way up to having $10-20k or more in one company. 

Ps. Almost everything I buy is for long term hold. 5-30 years. I set it and forget it. I have a handful (1-5) of specific stocks I watch with intent to possibly sell in the near future."
03/13/2021,stocks,Just depends how much free time you have. For me I like to sit in the 20-30 range. Anything over 30 just gets overwhelming when there's a ton of new info at once. For me. Sometimes if its a sector I'm not familiar with I'll just get the best looking Funds that are heaviest in the companies I'm most interested in. Right now I'm at about 27. I got to 38 a couple months back because everything was looking great and at start of the downturn I just started cutting the fat left and right because it was all too much to keep track of for the free time I had.
03/13/2021,stocks,I’m buying and holding for 20-30 years. I do have a few more short term stocks though (like reopening plays).
03/13/2021,stocks,"Yes you sound a lot like how I am. I like to watch all of the different companies and keep up with them. I’m not trying to get rich quick. I’m going to hold for the next 20-30 years. I may perform the same or slightly better than a few ETF’s, but it’s worth it to me to go through the process and sink or swim on my own."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Yeah I’m sure the more seasoned I am as an investor I’ll adjust my portfolio a bit. I started about two months ago, but right now I’m able to research and read the latest news on all of the companies I’m investing in. If that becomes a problem, I can always trim some of those off."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Then you can review your holds periodically, you don't need to watch them day to day."
03/13/2021,stocks,"I learn a bit and have a hobby that doesn’t involve having to talk to people IRL and also I don’t FOMO all my cash on something, I can buy 3-20 shares and call it a day. And only if I don’t mind holding it for 15 years if I miss selling a peak."

03/13/2021,stocks,"Going back over a decade, about 50% of the time.

In more recent years, after my earlier years trying to day-trade and be reckless, I've beaten the market by about 10-15% each year.

I'm a firm believer, with the proper discipline and education the retail investor can beat the market consistently year over year. A portfolio comprised of mostly index funds with no more than 20% in individual holding the retail investor can protect themselves when they're wrong while giving themselves the upside potential to beat the overall market.

*Edit: You asked about gaining over 10%, focus on beating the market instead. Gaining 10% can be achieved by a 100% index fund portfolio, which technically trails the overall market due to the expenses associated with the fund.*"
03/13/2021,stocks,We don't have the same mandate. I take on far more risk then would be appropriate to compare to what Social Security does. As a result I expect to beat the market. Risk and reward go hand in hand its not really a fair comparison to make.

When GME started erupting early January, I saw it as some meme pump and dump. But then I started reading and going over stuff like DFV's posts and his YouTube then said what the hey, YOLO, as it were.

I opened a brokerage account and put in what I could burn.

I am now up six figures, covered my cost basis, and pratically secured myself for quite some time since I am from the third world. The logic and reasoning was sound. The DD and numbers are there. And even if you disregard the squeeze play, there are some good fundamentals going forward.

My point is, I wouldn't so much characterize it as betting 50k on red—it's more of having been able to read a poker game well and making calculated decisions. Sure some noobs on WSB just jumped in on the hype and may eventually be left bagholding, but there definitely is some reason behind it.

Basically, to answer the OP, given the available data, it's still IMHO reasonable to jump in. And the squeeze aside, it may have long term viability.

Recent changes to business plan and the positive attention it’s received, definitely do increase its value from last year, but it is currently vastly over priced.

Example that isn’t dotcom related: Car companies. Certainly we can look to GM and Ford as a massive success, but we ignore the many many many car companies that were promising but ultimately failed. 

Example: Phones. Back in the early 2000s Blackberries was the shizzz man. Every executive had one. Nobody saw the iPhone coming. If you had bought BB stock, well, you’d be hurt bad after a huge run up.

03/13/2021,stocks,"Engineers and researchers create fusion reactions all the time, but they have not been able to use it as a commercial power source because of stray neutrons that damage the machinery.

03/13/2021,stocks,Briefing.com has some up to date ratings.
03/13/2021,stocks,"I always thought that the discrepancy was due to gapping. Meaning the closing cost yesterday is what it is at 4 p.m. exactly. And the opening cost is what the price is at 9:30 a.m.. a considerable amount of trading happens between these hours but is not counted for some reason. Therefore the opening price can be different than yesterday's closing price. I could be wrong but I thought that's what it was.

EDIT: My apologies, I just read the entire post and my answer is not sufficient. I hope you find what you're looking for."

EDIT2: If you have transaction data, you can make OHLC upon arbitrary time stamp... Usually when there is no trades in that time period you just push last known prices... For example I use 30 sec OHLC for my crpyto bot."

03/13/2021,stocks,Never seek tax advice from anyone but a professional.
03/13/2021,stocks,"I think if you make $20k and lose $10k, you only pay taxes on $10k difference. As long as that $10k loss is realized as well, not just on paper. 

Not a tax expert so not sure."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Let me answer: you will report the $10K gain in S/T investments on your schedule D. If you lost than money, also on a S/T investment you will report that loss also on Schedule D. 

S/T gains offset S/T losses and L/T gains offset L/T losses in any given tax year. What you need to be concerned about is when: the losses and gains occurred in different years and whether you had gains in the S/T while the losses occurred in the L/T. You can never offset L/T with S/T. Any other questions, ask away."
03/13/2021,stocks,"It is probably different for each country.

In my country - I win 10k - I lose 10k - my gains are 0 = no taxes."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Add: i am assuming when you say “worked to get the $10K back” you mean you contributed additional capital and made $10K in profit. Again: sales proceeds don’t get taxed, profit gets taxed (sales proceeds - cost basis). If your total S/T gains are greater than you S/T losses, then what ever that total gain is, will be taxed. I suggest always knowing your tax bracket and setting aside around 30% of your investing profits in a separate account to use to pay the taxes."
03/13/2021,stocks,You're not giving enough info. I'd suggest googling capital gains.
03/13/2021,stocks,"Your broker will keep a rolling total for your gains/losses. If you can access that online, that will tell you what you have in profits/losses."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Profit and losses only exists if you actually sell, until then they are unrealized gains and are not taxable(some democrats are pushing for this to change).

So you will get taxed for that first $10k since you sold that stock.

Since you have not sold the other stock you purchased there is no taxable event for that so you still owe the IRS the taxes from that $10K.

Lets say however before next year you sell that other stock.  You put in $10k already and lets say you added another $5k(since you did not specify) for a total of $15K.  If you sold all that stock for $20K you would have a profit of $5K.  That you lost ealier invested money does not matter to the IRS because it was not realized loss."
03/13/2021,stocks,"IRS doesnt care what you lose, whatever money you made you’ll be taxed on.  So you cash out 10k in gains you will be taxed on that.  Just because you put it back in and lose it doesnt matter."

03/13/2021,stocks,Don't put your money in meme stocks
03/13/2021,stocks,We have money invested in a lot of different places but it sounds like you might want to consider looking into an investment broker.  They usually charge around 1% and will help invest money in areas based on what your short and long term goals are.  I’d still recommend having a savings account with a bank in case of emergency.  Once you have that though I can understand wanting to invest since you get so little back when your money sits in savings.
03/13/2021,stocks,"Advice about what, exactly"
03/13/2021,stocks,Are you looking to take a risk or do you just want something that will hold it’s value but return more than a savings account?
03/13/2021,stocks,Banks over investment services tho...
03/13/2021,stocks,"Consider reading any book written by Peter Lynch. His books are very thorough and are easy reads for newer investors. He outlines what he looks for and gives you ideas of how to conduct your own research.

03/13/2021,stocks,If you're just starting out you may want to hit up YouTube for educational stuff. It'll help to be able to see it. Also reddit isn't real good at this since there's a lot of trolls and it's hard to have a great bs detector on a topic you don't know well.

The below are just some thoughts. Not advice. 

It would be a good start to build an emergency fund of directly available cash. 6 months of living-costs is a good start. Dave Rumsey's 7 baby steps are a good compass.

And then, invest on your own only money that you can afford to lose.

Other than that, do your reading, and please avoid derivatives like options, etc. Many trading platforms push people to leveraged derivative trading which is a fast-track way to lose your money if you don't know what you are doing (and even if you do sometimes)."

03/13/2021,stocks,"The plan right now is to ask around and see what the general consensus on what is a good starting point, I know it's a bit vague but if I keep hearing the same things from a bunch of different people then maybe that helps me to make a better decision, as I don't really know anything rn. And that is kinda what I was thinking, have my wages, pay for what I need to pay for and invest a % of what's left over"
03/13/2021,stocks,"Agree with this. For your risk tolerance something like 80% VTI (total market index fund) and 20% VUG (growth index fund) would probably suit you well. Very set and forget, just keep adding over time."

03/13/2021,stocks,"I suggest using Fidelity. Lots of research tools, good customer service, reliable and dependable broker without fees.

Know your risk tolerance. Don't kill yourself trying to pick stocks, it's much less stressful to use index funds. Don't forget an emergency fund. Don't put in any money you aren't comfortable losing. Buying stock is a risk. Period. If you don't want to take on risk, leave it in a bank account. 

Spend a lot of time on investopedia. Honestly with how green you are this question is probably better suited for /r/personalfinance. There is so much information lacking."
03/13/2021,stocks,ETFs are the way to go! A much higher return rate than bank accounts. Although if you do your research correctly and are in it for the long run there are some good stocks to hold! Obviously they are unpredictable and could go up and down though.

03/13/2021,stocks,They are pretty good with responding to email in 24 hours
03/13/2021,stocks,"Their cost basis does include the fees for options, otc, etc."
03/13/2021,stocks,Because their wait time is horrendous and they won't be able to answer anything about importing taxes.
03/13/2021,stocks,Hey man  if you have their app and contact them via calling them through the app the wait time is incredibly short.
03/13/2021,stocks,"IMO, no. Their overall news isn’t good. They need new management including the CEO.  GE is awesome in the medical and airplane engine world but doesn’t know how to handle it all."
03/13/2021,stocks,"You will hear a lot of negative stuff as it is more a boomer stock, but when you look at the sum of the parts - it has significant upward potential because of the new CEO.

&#x200B;

I actually like the reverse split - people must remember that GE was one of the most widely held stock and a dividend darling for years for the ""boomer"" generation. With their divestures over the last three years coupled with restructuring the number of outstanding were grossly exaggerated.

Most reverse splits are done to maintain NYSE / NASDAQ listing requirements - this is not the case with GE.

The new CEO has a tremendous track records and hold people accountable - not like Immelt and Flannery were idiots - I actually sold all my share after hearing Immelt give a talk - I did not trust him.

I brought back at $6 range and like the aviation and healthcare. They also got power stream-lined and the renewable platform will pay dividends for years.

I am just waiting for Steven Tusa to give an update analyst review and if positive, it will be off to the race."
03/13/2021,stocks,"GE is an American company who focuses on power generation, air travel (engines), and medical machinery. Two of the three are key aspects of Biden’s Build Back Better plan. The last will/has been positively impacted due to the coronavirus pandemic and our increasing use of the medical industry. (Medicare for all is coming, who is supplying the machinery to meet that demand?)

They are the largest producer of wind turbines in America. As we phase into renewable power, wind energy is at the top of the list. (Halide-X)

Nuclear Power is the final destination of renewable energy. Who do you think is going to produce the machinery, if not General ELECTRIC. 

Long term and short term, GE as a company has upsides. See above. 

Technically, GE is at their pre-covid price after consolidating around 10-11.50 for a few months, and broke out into the uptrend the past month. GE just announced an 8-1 reverse split, which may have caused the 15% drop in price over the last few trading days, which was quickly bought up at close of Thursday and all of Friday. I think this was really profit taking from their run from 7. Short term they’re still in an uptrend. 

Through the previous year, GE hit some serious support on their long term downtrend (previous few years) and are now positioned to head to the top of the channel they’re trading in and test that. Think 20-25 before they are met with serious resistance.

I hold Jan 2022 and Jan 2023 Calls at varying strikes, mostly $20 for both. June 21 $15. Sept 21 $15. 

Don’t listen to this noise on the management. They are getting paid big bucks to get their name dragged through the mud. Culp is bringing GE to the present. 
If you want to play renewables, this is it. If you want to play a comeback story, this is it. If you want to invest for any period longer than a year, this is it. If you want to make 20% by next month, you need something riskier."
03/13/2021,stocks,"I hate GE. They’ve been a turnaround company for 10 years. When are they gonna turnaround? Probably never.

If you buy GE and it out performs inflation, consider that a win"
03/13/2021,stocks,"GE is about to do an 8 to 1 reverse split. I was thinking about buying more, but then it started tanking and I sold the 1 free share I got from Webull. Lol"
03/13/2021,stocks,"I like GE! I think this will be one of the big turnaround story this or next year. It is a play on economy coming back and growing next year. It already did a big move. I think it will likely flatline and digest for the next few months but watch out, it can popped just like it did late last year. Also, L. Culp is a turnaround artist. I am wondering if Buffet at some point might jump in if not already. 

TLDR. Patience is a virtue here."
03/13/2021,stocks,There are much better industrials stocks than GE out there. IMHO
03/13/2021,stocks,GE isn't the same company it used to be but there seems to be a lot of what about GE posts.
03/13/2021,stocks,ORC for monthly dividends. Black Rock is their top investor with 8 trillion in assets. Can't go wrong with this one.
03/13/2021,stocks,Bought GE Call leaps this week.  $14. 01/22/2022.
03/13/2021,stocks,I dunno but the news was shitting all over them this week.
03/13/2021,stocks,I'm tempted to buy on Monday too. Also a rookie here. All I know is the company seems capable enough of bouncing back and there's been some positive news about their involvement in the UK wind turbine industry. Worth a look I think.

CVX

AXP
GE
BA

in that order."
03/13/2021,stocks,"I recently sold my GE (for a profit), but only to  free up additional cash for some more volatile plays.   They're always a solid  long term IMO, but I'm not sure if they're over their current fair value."
03/13/2021,stocks,GE lied to it’s shareholders for years and mislead them about tens of billions in liabilities. They settled with the SEC in December over it and paid barely anything for it. That didn’t impact their stock at all. I hate ge and think it needs to go under but somehow the American system just keeps them going
03/13/2021,stocks,"Thanks for the reply! I’ve heard some unsavory things about GE in the past, so I figured it may not be a smart move.

Anything you’re aware of right now that may be, that I can look into?"
03/13/2021,stocks,Check your trader commissions. I asked E*TRADE las t week and they charge $38 for reverse split adjustment. Maybe sell and buy to buy after the rs
03/13/2021,stocks,Haha that’s awesome. How is Webull? I’ve been looking at it. I have Robinhood.
03/13/2021,stocks,You had to sell your share anyways. 1/8= 0.125. or buy 7 more
03/13/2021,stocks,"Good one, just checked it out, probably buying a couple. Thanks."
03/13/2021,stocks,What happens to your strike price on these long calls if the stock does the reverse split?

03/13/2021,stocks,There is a lot!  I use a service called tipranks and has served me very well.  It depends if you’re looking for long term or short term.  I’m in the EV world for long term but short term I’ve been playing bio and medical.

03/13/2021,stocks,"No problem man. Good luck. It will take at least a year or maybe more to get the hang of it. My number one advice for you would be not to read the news, they like to pump the markets that's and my other advice would be not to panic sell when your stocks are red. Only invest what you can afford to lose. Best of luck."
03/13/2021,stocks,They get adjusted to new share value and option  correlation remain the same.
03/13/2021,stocks,My advice is to remain ignorant on them.
03/13/2021,stocks,Imagine tying a bonus to leaving a sustainable business behind after your time is done. Couldn't be me.
03/13/2021,stocks,I’ll check that out. I’m looking long term probably more than anything. I’m not sure I want to even try and get into short term game lol.
03/13/2021,stocks,"What are some of your long term EV plays?

I should have some exposure to that"
03/13/2021,stocks,"Absolutely, great advice I’ve heard before! Best to you as well!"
03/13/2021,stocks,Thats stupid advice. You think all the workers of the world are investing 15% of their paychecks every week because they can afford to lose it. Tell somebody they lost it after they try to collect a 401k they have been paying into for 45 years.

03/13/2021,stocks,"On top of the no brand loyalty aspect is immense pressure for Coupang to always have lowest prices. Because of the immediate price compare function in Naver search, if Coupang's price isn't lowest, then the customer will just as easily order from one of the other e-commerce platforms.


Not only is the market small and insular, but the fact Coupang is still unprofitable while operating in a country of 50m+ that's the size of Indiana (basically a logistics dream) is not ideal.


Coupang is constantly in the news here for workers' rights violations. There is a steady stream of stories about their workers dropping dead from exhaustion and overwork, inhumane conditions in warehouses, and drivers operating trucks on little to no sleep between long shifts.


I think it can grow eventually, and I use Coupang firsthand, but they have a lot of issues to work out. The $35 per share price was on the high end of where they should be now until they complete the possible rumored merger with Yogiyo."

Korea.   I've been there many times over the years and my impression is they prefer their homegrown industries when it comes to things like this.  Also, they'd have to make a crazy large investment to try to compete in Korea.  Consider Coupang has it's own delivery fleet and warehouses all over Korea now."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Understood, and people love to make that point.  Just me, I can't think of a better description for the ""order stuff online and they deliver to your house"" part of the business  lol"
03/13/2021,stocks,Yes they do. you can look up their website rn.
03/13/2021,stocks,Thanks! means a lot. Good to hear that too about your GF. Nice to have to have some reassurance that isn't just statistics.
03/13/2021,stocks,"It's really hard to get goods through Amazon in Korea. Not impossible, but there are many things that will not ship. Also I am speaking from the experience of having an APO address not a Korean address.

We tried to buy tennis rackets and they wouldn't ship."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Korea is very protectionist. Foreign companies have an infamously hard time to establish there. Same reason you for example can't use Google Maps in Korea, because the government considers the map data 'confidential' (something along the lines of containing sensitive information that, North Korea, yada yada) and only shares it with select national companies (Kakao, Naver)."
03/13/2021,stocks,"There are a lot of delivery services/companies in Korea that I don’t think Amazon has any space for competiton. I know a lot of people use Coupang for sure, and they’re known for their super quick delivery."
03/13/2021,stocks,Right now yes. 40% isnt much but think long term. No one starts out with 100% market share unless its a completely new service or product. I think in the next 10 years 40% MS will be long behind them
03/13/2021,stocks,"They didn't change it -- the price went up based on all the buy and stop limit buy orders that were already placed in advance after the price was set.   Normal market forces.    The day before Roblox had (I believe) a 45.00 price set, but if you didn't place a stop limit for at least 65.00, you missed out as soon as the symbol went up.   In other words, the ""official"" price is set, but as soon as you have a lot of buy orders, it naturally goes up, even before it's open.   Especially with IPOs, it's best to wait a bit for the price to settle."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Thanks! Defiantly helps. sorry I didn't know about the IPO change, shoulda looked into that. But for me this in absolute 10-15 year play. With that said I no doubt will be watching carefully."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Possibly, I'm really not to sure about short term growth, even in year. Would love to see them go to $70 eoy but I really think this a loooo0oongggggggg play. Personally gonna be holding for at LEAST 10 years. Prob more like 15-20"
03/13/2021,stocks,I like too :)
03/13/2021,stocks,Stocks?
03/13/2021,stocks,The real dd is in the comments
03/13/2021,stocks,"100% agree. While OP did a lot of research it shows how living in the country completely changes anything you might read about the company. For example, The coupang eats being the largest online food delivery service means absolutely nothing, because as you know, every single restaurant will deliver piping hot food to your door, plates, bowls, and all, in 5 mins. by scooter without even using the internet. Since phone delivery is still huge there. 

No one orders food online. Everyone ordered by phone. So saying they are #1 online food delivery is kind of irrelevant when every restaurant pools local scooter delivery services."
03/13/2021,stocks,They are and they aren't. Since japan and Korea war they have animosity. I have met people in S korea who were more sympathetic to north korean than Japanese.
03/13/2021,stocks,Long history between the two countries and not so pleasant in modern times
03/13/2021,stocks,"Japan occupied Korea by force and committed atrocities against the population while here, including but not limited to razing important cultural relics to the ground and forcing the locals into indentured servitude.


It's not a pleasant relationship."
03/13/2021,stocks,"On paper, against China, possibly. But, like I said they all hate each other with a passion. They have thousands of years of stabbing each other in the back, or raping others women, or killing others men, or claiming each others territory. 

As an outsider in Korea, it was quite amazing to see so much national pride in all of East Asia. In the West you show up at the border, claim refugee status and boom ""Welcome to Canada, Canadian."" I could live 100 years in Korea and learn the language inside and out and become a part of the community and raise children there and I would always without hesitancy be a waygookin, a foreigner."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Right, but a lot of that is because of access to international markets for companies like Samsung, LG, Hyundai and Kia. It would be harder for something like Coupang to expand outside of Korea, though of course, far from impossible as we have seen with AliExpress. They just need to be able to offer something that sites like Amazon and AliExpress cannot."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Yeah, but the 1st biggest economy is way different than 2, 3, or all the way at 10. California alone is the 5th. I wouldn’t expect it to be at same valuation as Amazon. Probably 5th of a size at most."
03/13/2021,stocks,Are they working towards international E-commerce?
03/13/2021,stocks,Yup totally. Market size is a little cause for concern right now but I do think it is for RIGHT NOW. they are growing experientially as a country. Just look at their GDP growth over the years. In that case I think as a long term hold (10+ years) this is a great buy
03/13/2021,stocks,Totally agree. I think in the next 10 years Korea will be BOOMing similar to the Japan market
03/13/2021,stocks,CPNG
03/13/2021,stocks,Yup. exactly. As big as Amazon is it would be difficult for them to compete with Coupang now and even more in the years to come
03/13/2021,stocks,I don’t see anything about web services on their site. Link??
03/13/2021,stocks,"Sorry, but what's APO address?"
03/13/2021,stocks,Anytime! Nice DD. It just happens I was in on this one but at a loss during opening. It dropped fast and reminded me the volatility of GME and how fast it went. It seems overpriced now because it was shown to public at $35 but Coupang wanted more starting at $61. I took the risk. Sharing my experience. I’ll be watching carefully as well!
03/13/2021,stocks,Wait lemme go check Amazon ALL TIME CHART rq 😭😭
03/13/2021,stocks,I agree. They're not even profitable yet. They're rapid expansion into many different markets has obviously come at a cost. But once all the stars align. I believe this will be a very strong long term plays.
03/13/2021,stocks,OP did a bunch of copy and pasting
03/13/2021,stocks,And forcing them to take Japanese names.
03/13/2021,stocks,Not to sure. Nothing came up about that in the research I did. I think they are Focused on truly capturing 100% of market share in Korea before doing so
03/13/2021,stocks,">OnionsAreGODS

Who are the biggest competitors to Coupang Play in S Korea (as in who are they up against to grab market share in streaming?   I haven't been there in a while thanks to Covid, but I know Netflix is available there."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Sorry I misunderstood. Though you meant if they just had a website (still very new at this) As for Web Services I don't think so. But again, very rapidly growing company, wouldn't be surprised to see this implemented in the coming years. Sorry again."
03/13/2021,stocks,"United States Army (and Air Force) Post Office.   Navy and Marines have FPO addresses (Fleet Post Office).   Even in a war zone, a US base has an APO or FPO address."
03/13/2021,stocks,Miltary address. Army Post Office is where the term came from.
03/13/2021,stocks,Yea defiantly seems a little overpriced right now. I'm sure in the future it'll blow by its current price but I'll defiantly be looking to get in at a cheaper price over the next few weeks.
03/13/2021,stocks,Lool. Hopefully in 10 years Coupang’l look the same
03/13/2021,stocks,"Yea forsure Netflix is a competitor but that’s just one competitor in one sector of their business. I know that in e-commerce there is Gmarket owned by eBay and a few or however this doesn’t discount the fact that Coupang is the largest one and will (Probably) continue to be. With the different sectors Coupang has in I believe in the future even if one isn’t doing so well the company will still be very profitable. Also not to mention that almost everyone I know has BOTH Netflix and Amazon prime, and some even have crave and shit as well. Also with their grocery deliver service I don’t think there is any major competitor."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Netflix and Watcha. Watcha is much better than Netflix in Korea though. Both are starting to become more popular these days but for years, Koreans have been quite happy with satellite TV. Watcha and Netflix are definitely becoming more of a norm now though.

Imho, Coupang isn’t going to do well competing against those two for streaming."
03/13/2021,stocks,"So it sounds like this is more comparable to jd.com than it is to amazon.

Easily the most attractive aspect of amazon is the cloud aspect."
03/13/2021,stocks,Naver is big in cloud services in Korea right?
03/13/2021,stocks,"So APO is now catch-all for all branches of US military?   I'm pretty sure there's still FPO as well, but I could be wrong, I'm retired now."
03/13/2021,stocks,Amazon rlly was like $2 ipo 🤦🏾‍♂️😂😂...but yeah it would take time but prolly not that long cos I think Amazon made e-commerce make sense for the world so other start ups will see growth sooner..just like Tesla is doing for NiO 😭😭🤷🏾‍♂️

03/13/2021,stocks,Totally agree. Guess we’ll see!
03/13/2021,stocks,"I ended up looking it up.  It depends on the base: Army or Air Force have APO addresses, Navy/Marine Corps bases have FPO addresses.  DPO is Diplomatic Post Office, which is used by embassies."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Such a weird app. I don't get what they're trying to do. I think Fidelity management is hobbling the app, demanding it not be as ""gamified"" as RobinHood but it sucks.

I have multiple Fidelity accounts and this assumes I only have 1. The portfolio overview doesn't show the whole thing. Instead the landing page is the ""goals"" nonsense. I'm here to gamble, bitch."
03/13/2021,stocks,It finally added trading? I'm interested in it again. The UI is great compared to the main app but being a goals only app was holding it back. Going to try it out when the market opens on Monday.
03/13/2021,stocks,The app won’t even let me log in.

03/13/2021,stocks,"Lmao, or fable 2 or 3 was great if you just bought houses or assets along the way, at the end of the game if you owned enough you were able to make a hefty sum and pay to feed your ppl and to go to war.

03/13/2021,stocks,"This post seems to be a better example of the benefits of compound interest. 

It's been a few years since I studied this so I may be making a mistake, but a better example of the time value of money would be looking at how 1000$ today is not equal to 1000$ a year from now. We can see the difference in value by rearranging the equation in your post and calculating for PV, and using interest rate as rate of return.

You can use the time value of money to determine whether or not an investment is worth it based on the expected future return."

03/13/2021,stocks,"CAPM made a lot of TVM pretty redundant for equity valuations. Free Cash flow models then did the same for capm. 

It’s been 12 years since I got my finance degree so for all I know, free cash flow valuations are no longer cool and there’s a new thing in town."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Thanks for reading.  I'd be happy if it were at least debated, but the way it's quickly dismissed out of hand is disconcerting if not alarming... not for my sake, but theirs."
03/13/2021,stocks,"The thing that makes Taipan interesting is that it's more addicting than a lot of modern strategy games because of a loophole that was never intended to be there, and was in fact closed on the web-based version of the game... which nobody plays.

03/13/2021,stocks,"""Any number times zero is still zero."" - Warren Buffett

Every dollar of lost principal sets you back 160 future dollars... this is why chasing insane returns is too much work for too little reward in the long run.

A steady return of 7 or 8% per year is more productive than occasionally gaining huge returns only to lose half of them on the next gamble.  And if the strategy to mitigate such loss is keeping bets so small (the so-called ""fuck around"" account) that you're doubling less than 1% of your total portfolio, it is a complete waste of your own valuable time."

03/13/2021,stocks,You were hoping I was an actual ten-year old drug lord?  (kidding)
03/13/2021,stocks,"Two sides of the same coin.  What my finance professor did (30 years ago) was start with TVM and move us on to everything built atop the concept of present and future value, including DCF analysis."

03/13/2021,stocks,Why not?
03/13/2021,stocks,"FCF is still relevant... the thing is, if you're teaching finance, you begin with the TVM so you can more easily explain CAPM, WACC, etc.  It's been over 30 years since I studied finance, but that hasn't changed.  Once a student understands the concepts of premiums, discounts, present and future value, teaching the rest is iterative."

I was making fun of guys like you a few days ago pointing out the ridiculous extremes on this subreddit. You lost all your monies in the 2000 bubble day trading while stonks only go up until they don't, then you went full extreme on the other side into value investing and now you go around praising warren buffett like the god he is"
03/13/2021,stocks,"Very true. Can’t understand FCF without CAPM, and can’t understand CAPM without TVM."
03/13/2021,stocks,"But there's nothing learned from pushing buttons.  Most of the traders touting ""meme stonks"" have been at it with their fuck around accounts for less than five years and they still don't actually understand the underlying business or finance fundamentals, they're just jumping on bandwagons and getting lucky.

That's not at all how I moved from day trading to swing trading to mid cap value to large cap value to ultra large cap value... pushing buttons did not introduce me to any financial concepts that actually grew my portfolio to the scale that it is.  It was the application of five years of accounting and finance education and the practice of conducting business valuations over the course of 20 years which can be compared to actual market performance without ever spending a dime to own shares."
03/13/2021,stocks,"It depends on your time horizon.  If you look at the S&P's averages for any 10 year period, they vary, but as soon as you go out 20, 30, 40, 50 years, they all start to normalize around 10.6-10.7%.

I haven't sat and looked at every hedge fund or mutual fund out there but I recall that something like 85% of fund managers can't beat the S&P so I would be surprised to find 15% holding up for decades-long timespans.   

I've averaged 17.11% since 2009, beating the S&P's large cap CAGR of 14.65% (I don't hold small cap or mid cap and haven't for a while so the entire index might not be an apt comparison)... but even that I don't think is sustainable for decades on end, it'll regress toward the mean."

To add, initially my goal with this post wasn't even yet moving into equity valuation... just the ability to understand what a dollar ought to be worth tomorrow vs. today. 

I can't speak for all countries, but here Americans are so lacking in the most fundamental financial concepts that it's scary... not in a ""Oh haha he doesn't understand securities analysis"" way but more like ""Oh my god this is a grown adult who doesn't know how compound interest works."""

03/13/2021,stocks,"I'm attacking a point, and using you as an example. The point being the life cycle of a day trader always seems to end up being that people always make stupidly risky plays then the mentality that leads to those risks reverses 180 because that's how extremes work. Instead of nuance it's always yoloing into risk or hyper conservative plays, when instead knowing when to be risky and when to be conservative make you a better investor.

I think that's a pretty valuable lesson to teach, one a lot of these traders could learn from."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Derivatives are a different matter.  But learning what things are is a different thing from gaining proficiency in analysis which is conducted apart from the activity of purchasing and selling the asset (or derivative).  Standard and Poor's is a great example of this:  SPGI doesn't actually own securities in the index, they simply select, analyze, and track securities comprising the index.

You could spend 25 years staring at a trading terminal and never learn a thing about discounted cash flow analysis.

DCF analysis is more akin to taking apart and rebuilding a car than driving it... the latter will teach you zilch about the former.  The reason to learn the former is to more accurately understand how cars work.  Then you can understand the differences between efficient and inefficient cars, the things that make engines break down, the cost of maintaining them, and therefore have a very detailed picture of which cars are likely to perform better in the long run without finding out the hard way."
03/13/2021,stocks,"When you lead with ""This sounds like an r/investingcirclejerk post if there ever was one,"" it belies the claim that teaching is foremost on your mind.  Or maybe you're just lacking in social awareness... whatever the case is, it's clearly not winning you converts."

Until 2 days passed. I felt like I had the flu, nonstop shitting, migrain, hot sweats when it was freezing, couldn't eat or drink without having to piss out my ass like a fire hose. Went to the doc the next day and they were under the impression I had some kinda something. I go to sit back down to get my script and see some ppl I recognize and turns out I wasn't the only one. Over the next few days over 150 people got salmonella from the food.

Facebook went ape shit with allegations following this and eventually everyone put their 2 cents in on this restaurants yelp. Over 80 1 star reviews later they didn't look so sharp. Only 2 days later they paid for all their reviews to be taken down as if nothing ever happened.

Not sure if that's right but fuck that restaurant and fuck yelp."

You would pay taxes whether you buy other stock or not. It's still income. Now, the way its measured depends on what tax bracket you're in. Also, if you have over 3K in losses for the year, your cap is 3k for a year to claim them against your capital gains, but you can also carry over the excess of the 3K in losses until next year and so on. So, 9K in losses can carry over 3 years. I'm not a tax lawyer, but that's what I understand."

03/13/2021,stocks,"Capital losses don't decrease the taxes you owe on a dollar for dollar basis. To clarify, yes they will offset your capital gains, but they don't decrease your taxes payable by that amount. So let's say you owe $2000 in taxes on a capital gain. Let's assume you are getting taxed at 15% for a long term capital gain (this could be different based on your tax bracket). You would have made a gain on your investment of $13,333. If you had $2,000 in losses to offset, your taxable gain would then be $11,333 and you would owe about $1,700 in taxes."

If you had certain stocks that were in the red and wanted to sell to reduce tax burden, the  do that and deduct the losses.

But doing what you have described is voluntarily losing a lot of money to avoid paying a little money in tax. 

Tl;dr: cull the losers in your portfolio. Pay your taxes."
03/13/2021,stocks,Yeah get $2000 worth of AMD calls
03/13/2021,stocks,These are the kind of threads I love. Thank you for asking about this. I have found so much to know. (Don't know what you don't know situation for me). This is all stuff I need to know for next to season since I'm a noob at stocks
03/13/2021,stocks,Delete
03/13/2021,stocks,"You don’t get a subtraction of what you owe. You get a subtraction of what your total income is. 

So, (assuming 20% bracket for easy math):
If you make $100 you owe $20

If you make $100 and lose $20 you will then owe $16 NOT $0. (20% of your $80 total gains)

If you make $100 and owe $20 and throw and extra $20 at a risky stock and lose it, you’ve spent $20 to save $4


Now what you CAN do is figure out your tax bracket and only sell off enough to keep you from going into a higher tax bracket. This should save you money (assuming you don’t lose value on the stock in the mean time, or that your opportunity cost of not diversifying isn’t higher than paying a higher tax bracket.)
Depending on how much the stock is worth this may take a very long time to do. Or, if might just take one or two years. 

Also if you don’t have a Roth IRA get, get one. Like yesterday. And max it out each year. You may not want to take high risk trades in that account though. 

Or also you can open other Retirement type accounts that won’t owe any capital gains until you cash them out in retirement. This has the downside of not being able to spend the money in the mean time, but you don’t pay taxes on every trade. (You pay taxes when you withdraw at retirement. Also your contributions (not gains) are tax deductible in many account types, which can help you stay in a lower tax bracket )

Otherwise just pay the gains and move on - it means you made money which is a good thing. The only reason you may need to be sure not to take any gains is if, for example it will negate any benefits you receive (for example, let’s say you receive Medicaid. If you make $1000 in selling stock that is not enough to pay for even two mo this of health insurance if you get kicked off Medicaid, but could be enough to affect your income (temporarily) but kick you off Medicaid for the year. It would be a net loss on selling the stock. (Of course if your gains are $125k then losing Medicaid wouldn’t be an issue since you can afford health insurance from your gains.)

If it’s a substantial amount of money, it would be worth the fee to talk to a financial planner."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Capital gains/losses require you to have held the stock for more than 1 year. This strategy will not work.

Edit: also capital gains maxed out at 20% depending on your income."
03/13/2021,stocks,Yeah theoretically it could work. I mean either way you're out 2k
03/13/2021,stocks,"Capital gains is only paid when you withdraw to your account. If you use that to reinvest, then no worries."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Yes, it’s a long term hold. 
For tax reasons it’s stupid to sell, but for portfolio reasons, it’s 70% of my portfolio. If this one stock tanks I’ve lost basically everything. Not really the greatest strategy. What’s annoying is selling part of it to buy other stocks nails me for capital gains tax...but that’s uncle sam.
 
Good to know that losses only count up to $3k. 
But reading other posts, maybe I’m misunderstanding how losses are calculated. 
If I sell a stock at a $2,000 dollar loss, and I sell a stock with gains amounting to $2k in capital gains tax, do I owe $0 in taxes?"
03/13/2021,stocks,">Also, if you have over 3K in losses for the year, your cap is 3k for a year to claim them against your capital gains, but you can also carry over the excess of the 3K in losses until next year and so on. So, 9K in losses can carry over 3 years.

This is not correct or not expressed correctly.  All your capital losses can be used to offset capital gains.  You can only claim $3K of losses against income.  The excess over $3K can then be carried forward to offset future gains or income.

Example: You make 100 trades during a year.  Totaling up all the gains and losses, you have $10K of gains and $20K of losses.  The $20K of losses are used to wipe out your $10K in gains, so now you have $10K in losses.  $3K of that can be used to reduce ordinary income.  $7K is carried forward to the next year where it can be used to offset capital gains or reduce another $3K of income.  There are a few quirks when it comes to mixing short and long term capital gains/losses.  The purpose of those basically boil down to not being able to use long term losses to offset short term gains, thus reducing taxes, when there are long term gains they could have been applied against."

And, yes I read about this penalty issue. Annoying... I have to research this as well."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Oh shit.. I’m totally stupid. 
Of course. 
Losses are subtracted from total gains, not tax obligation. 

Say you have 10,000 in gains. 
Then you lose 2,000 on another stock. 
Now you only made 8k, so this is what’s taxed. 

My idea is totally flawed... and now I feel stupid.
But cool to read some of the responses about taxes. 
Investing hasn’t been to hard for me ... safe investing. But I’ve never sold. So now it’s time to learn about the tax obligations."
03/13/2021,stocks,"You’re going to pay the taxes eventually. (And if he is in a low bracket not but will be in a higher bracket later on in life, as tends to happen, it may be cheaper to pay those gains now instead of waiting.)

But if this one stock tanks (or plateaus) he will lose (or opportunity cost) far more $ than he will “save” by deferring taxes."
03/13/2021,stocks,Already looking at some replies I’m figuring out how I’m thinking about this wrong. You’re correct in your ideas.
03/13/2021,stocks,"Yeah, I don’t think that’s correct, because that would mean day traders wouldn’t pay any tax."
03/13/2021,stocks,This isn’t true at all. You pay taxes on everything you sell with a gain whether you reinvest or not.
03/13/2021,stocks,"Just to clarify the 3k loss rule, this is a NET amount. All short term gains and losses are netted, then long term gains and losses are better, then the net of the net determines if you have a capital loss. 

In addition, a 2k capital loss does not equate to a 2k tax deduction. This is an “above the line” deduction that is still reduced by you standard deduction, to arrive at AGI, and then multiplied by your marginal tax rate."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Yes, in that situation you would owe $0 in taxes."
03/13/2021,stocks,Yup. It's a wash

03/13/2021,stocks,"Annoying isn’t it that if you owe taxes at the end of the year you get penalized because the government has to wait for their taxes, but if you overpaid and are due a refund they don’t pay you interest on the extra money they kept all year? You should try to be as even/neutral as possible at tax time because you could have compounded your “tax refund” had you saved it wisely instead of giving the government an interest free loan for the year."
03/13/2021,stocks,Short term is taxed at ordinary income rates
03/13/2021,stocks,"Two different tax rates. Over year is long term cap gains, less than one year is short term. Short term is a much higher rate."
03/13/2021,stocks,"The person is referring to long-term capital gains. Holding under a year is short term capital gains, which in the US are taxed as ordinary income. As such, the person is probably not considering them “capital gains/losses”. Technically short-term is still capital gains/losses still are, but the person is probably just considering them regular income."
03/13/2021,stocks,Why would you report anything on your taxes if that money stays in your investment account? If you use this money to reinvest there is no tax event. It’s similar to selling a house then using that money to invest in another house.
03/13/2021,stocks,Dude how long have you been investing? This is not true at all. If you knowingly don’t report your Capitol gains that’s tax evasion. Don’t give financial advice when you have no idea what you’re talking about. You get a 1099 every year from your broker that needs to be reported.
03/13/2021,stocks,I was referring to my IRA. So I guess this question depends on what account this person is using.
03/13/2021,stocks,Sure man😂😂
03/13/2021,stocks,No need to explain further but this doesn’t apply to my IRA.
03/13/2021,stocks,Take ur profits and run.
03/13/2021,stocks,Theta decay is big as you approach expiration. I'd get out now and get ready for your next trade. You doubled your money. Take profits while there is still some extrinsic value.
03/13/2021,stocks,You should be able to sell on any of those days as options volume for amc are pretty high.
03/13/2021,stocks,"If you think AMC closes higher on Friday than on Wednesday, you may want to hold to sell at higher prices. 

A slightly different strategy which I personally would use would be on Wednesday, to sell say a $15c for Friday and thus make it into a spread. If AMC goes higher by Friday then you’d realize max profits, and if not, then you atleast got the profit from premium sold."
03/13/2021,stocks,I would sell it and roll it to a later expiry.
03/13/2021,stocks,"https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/calculator/long-call.html

This will show you the price difference. Often it will need a great price increase to be worth what it was a day or two before. You can probably view the trading volume of your option on your brokerage website to see how many people are currently buying and selling it. I learned the hard way about an unpopular option. But a popular hype stock like amc, I can't imagine you'd have any trouble selling it wed or Thursday or maybe even Friday if the price action is still there.

And keep in mind the options calculator goes off IV at the time of calculating. The IV can rise or fall greatly within minutes hours or days."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Look at the implied volatility for that day and make sure it's high when you sell. It should be, but it does fluctuate. I would not hold until Friday. What number do you have in mind? You should always have a number on mind when you sell. Be comfortable with that. Keek in kind that BEARS will always make money. BULLS will always make money. But pigs get slaughtered. Dont be greedy. Take the wins when you can..hindsight will always be 20-20 so, be comfortable with your decision."

03/13/2021,stocks,"The options detail I haven’t been able to wrap my head around is what happens if your option expires ITM but you don’t exercise it? Will your broker automatically sell it off to someone buying shares? Do you have to manually close them? If there isn’t enough buying interest in the stock (which theoretically shouldn’t happen if your call was ITM) can your ITM call expire worthless if you don’t exercise and buy the stock?

I think it might just be too dumb of a question so no[t many] YouTube videos etc seem to have addressed it that I can find 😂

(Ps i do understand the concept of EV expiring and it might be a wash on holding longer if IV isn’t expected to skyrocket.)"
03/13/2021,stocks,I think if your option expires ITM since no one else can buy it at that point your broker will expect you to exercise the contract and purchase the shares either by using the money you have in your account or liquidating other shares you own to pay it off. I could definitely be wrong though.
03/13/2021,stocks,This is the way.
03/13/2021,stocks,Okay cool! I just didn't know how long it usually takes to have someone buy your contract (never sold one before)
03/13/2021,stocks,"In that's sense, if you think it will get higher that the strike price. Rolling it will do the same before it expires?"
03/13/2021,stocks,"rolling it to a later expiry is essentially the same thing as selling to close then buying a new call option.. except by rolling it does it all in one fell swoop, right?"
03/13/2021,stocks,Yea honestly I've made double my investment at this point. If I notice a dip at EOD between Monday and Wed I'll probably sell it and walk with my money buy more AMC and maybe try two calls instead of one
03/13/2021,stocks,ITM exercises automatically...
03/13/2021,stocks,"You can buy the shares on margin and immediately sell them for a profit. You do not need cash available to exercise the option. You exercise your option, buy the shares at the strike, and then immediately sell the shares at market for a profit = the spread."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Usually they sell in seconds, unless it is a very low volume stock. If it doesn’t, the value probably shifted while trying to sell."
03/13/2021,stocks,Yeah it sells instantly if you meet the bid

03/13/2021,stocks,"You need the money May 1st? Even buying a 10 year treasury bond yielding 1.6% would still only net you 0.2% in that short amount of time. That’s $30, with principle risk if rates jump quick. Just hold it in cash."

My third answer is ... keep it in savings or checking if you need it May 1."

Everyone knew some of these banks were in great shape with fortress balance sheets even though revenues would be down for 2020 with rates going zero,  shutdowns and less spending & retail banking suffering so share prices would tank and rebound only once spending returned probably a year or two later. 

Amongst the bluechip lenders, I bought JPM and AXP last year at various price points on the way down yielding ~4% and ~2.5% and I'm up by some 75% & 70% on those buys.

But I'm a little squeamish about anything lithium related as the top producing countries are iffy AF. China is a large producer and they won't share. Chile and Argentina are unfortunately being taken over by the Chinese, so they won't be as reliable the further China expands its sphere of influence. Aluminum doesn't have these issues."

03/13/2021,stocks,"Most people will tell you to do etfs (spy, qqq) or dividend funds as individual stocks come with more risk. But it largely depends on your investing goals your risk tolerance and how much brain space you want to devote to it.

That being said aapl at 121 about to announce ev production and planning on spending all their cash is a solid play."
03/13/2021,stocks,"I am going to use an analogy to show difference between stock picking and index funds.


Imagine betting on horse races was actually in your favor, where the house gave you favorable odds.


Index funds is like betting on every single horse, and over the long term, you are expected to make a ~8% profit a year, which is nice.


Stock picking is ""risky"", because even if you bet on a good horse, he could lose the race. But a skilled stock picker should generally be able to choose a favorable one. And index funds does include a lot of terrible horses you should never bet on.


Additionally, a popular strategy of investors is to ""DCA"" when they're down. Its a great strategy to do with an index fund like VTI, but it can be pretty risky to do with individual stocks. Why? Because in theory an individual stock can literally crumble and never come back."
03/13/2021,stocks,Goals are certainly important to ascertain here. Stocks are all about risk tolerance. Safe steady growth would be stocks like apple Pepsi wal mart etc. High risk are speculative with bigger swings up and down. More money to be made or lost. Ev's are sexy plays right now. Stocks like goev lucid plug just to name a few. Balance is usually the key. Mix in some safe with some spec. Every decent investor will always recommend diversification
03/13/2021,stocks,"Vanguard is great, fidelity is great as well. I use fidelity primarily and have some in Schwab as well.

I’m a fan of individual stock and any of the big platforms will be fine for you.

03/13/2021,stocks,"Starting out I’d say stick with the classic advice. 

Trade an area you are comfortable in. Know tech trade tech, don’t have a clue about tech don’t buy it. (At first)

Do DD, To often people with high risk tolerance, confuse speculative, with gambling. Speculative or high risk investment with proper DD is ok if it meets your personal goals. Gambling is not. Want to gamble head to Vegas, you’ll have better odds. 

DD is an on going thing, revisit your positions. Make sure you still like what you see. Don’t marry a stock. If you don’t like what you see exit. Move to the next one. 

Stay Diversified, It’s easy to forget when your picking your own stocks. Not just across companies but sectors. I have accounts at Fidelity, TD and Vanguard. Love them all, but absolutely love M1 for the simplicity of building out my own portfolio. 

Set goals and parameters that fit your personal situation. That way you don’t react out of emotion. A panic sell, or a FOMO buy can destroy gains faster then any downturn or correction. 

Be aware of chances to average down. Wether it be by exiting and coming back in lower, or buying the dips. 

If you have real brokerages already, (Not Webull, or Robincrook) remember they will provide you information about companies. Don’t know where to start your DD, have them send you everything they have on a company. This is what they do, take advantage of what your paying for. TD just sent me 182 pages of research/Data on a company I’m looking into. 

Lastly have fun, if it’s not fun. You don’t enjoy it. Let the pros do it for you or stick to indexes. Sacrificing enjoyment for money is never a fair value trade."

If I buy an option contract from someone who write it for 40$ they get a $40 premium. If that contract goes up to $45 and I sell it I get the new premium giving me $5 profit and the original guy $40. My question is if that sold contract is exercised who’s on the hook for the shares?

For example, if I write a call and you buy that call I am short one call option and you are long one call option.

At the same time I am still short one call option so I am liable to sell 100 shares if and when that option is exercised."
03/13/2021,stocks,The writer of the call most of the time already owns the stock. They generally sets the strike price at price they are willing to sell at. But the original writer is responsible for the stock at the closing date.

2021-03-13 17:39:13,stocks,"The Irrational Motley Fool Hate For a sub dedicated to thorough research and controlling emotion, you guys sure are quick to jump on a hate bandwagon without doing ANY investigation on what you're trashing.

I think the confusion with TMF stems from the fact that all of their free articles are written by dozens to hundreds of different contributors, so of course they're going to contradict each other much of the time. Their free articles are not one person publishing two opposite opinions, it is roughly equivalent to what happens here: A contributor has an opinion on a company and gives their pitch. The next day, another contributor may publish a bear case for that company. Like this sub, some posts are an interesting jumping off point to start your own research, and some is ill-informed drivel. You're an investor, do your own damn research.

I know, I know. ""Nice try Motley Fool employee, LOL."" I have nothing to lose or gain here. I pay TMF $99 a year for some stock recommendations (that more than pay for the membership), and that's the extent of the skin I have in this game. I'll stop paying them that tiny fee when they stop making me money. The source of my frustration is that many of you believe yourselves to be knowledgeable and well-informed investors, but still haven't figured out how to google ""is The Motley Fool a scam?"" and taken a glance at some numbers.

If they do have a bear case, then i will read the article and try to see if it makes sense. If they convince me of the bear case, no problems, i'll look for another stock.

When your new broker requests the transfer from Robinhood they can say no for a variety of reasons (like margin debit, though I didn’t have any), and then the new broker can be really bad at communicating/answering (cough fidelity) and all of a sudden you’re three weeks in with no movement.

All the major brokerages are backed up so plan for 10-15 business days for asset transfer and your cost basis records to follow another 10-15 after that."
03/13/2021,stocks,Easy to fidelity. Cost $75 but fidelity credited that back to me. Not sure if they do it for smaller accounts. It took 3 business days but my cost basis is still not there 3 weeks later.

I signed up on Fidelity and as part of my account setup, it asked if I wanted to move stuff from another brokerage and I searched for Robinhood (it found it no problem.

Definitely something to be aware of as I was caught off guard and frustrated."
03/13/2021,stocks,"To jump on the fidelity train and say something I haven't read here yet, fidelity has so much more capital and does their own clearing, it's one of the main reasons they were able to keep trading GME during the peak in January, when other clearing houses told smaller brokers like Robinhood they had to front 100% collateral and RH pulled the plug.

I had options on Robinhood. The contracts transfer but your eligibility to open or buy more contracts is restricted. YOU NEED TO MAIL IN A PAPER APPLICATION?!?!? Yes.

03/13/2021,stocks,How much did you transfer? When I transferred to fidelity I mentioned it to a customer service rep once and he said it would be reimbursed. Then later another customer service rep said if I transferred $25k it would be reimbursed.
03/13/2021,stocks,We’re you charged by robinhood?
03/13/2021,stocks,Oh really? So you can only transfer over shares in whole numbers?

There are a few things you do need to call them to activate though, such as penny stocks and they’ll read you a warning that you’re probably about to fuck around and find out, but it’s on you. Fidelity has great costumer service though any time I’ve called but they have been backed up since everyone has been leaving robinhood.

Yes their app is ugly. They have one that’s seems a little more up to date coming called Fidelity Spire but as of right now it doesn’t have trading on it, but have read that it will eventually."
03/13/2021,stocks,My problem with Fidelity is that I can't do spreads without  at least 10k in the account. Wish I had known that before i bought and expensive leap to do PMCCs. I need to find a different broker until I grow the account. Or just take the hit on the Leap?

It’s not much (about 10k). I was hesitant to add more or set up recurring deposits if I was going to take it all out anyway. May just keep it and set up a fidelity for the IRA and ETF stuff.
03/13/2021,stocks,Did you sell all positions then rebuy or did fidelity move everything for you?
03/13/2021,stocks,It’s $75
03/13/2021,stocks,RH and Etrade both charge $75.00 (personal experience)
03/13/2021,stocks,"Wrong, they absolutely can and do.    I transferred from RH \_and\_ Etrade, and both charged 75.00.  I was reimbursed for both by my new broker though.   Perhaps Fidelity just covered yours automatically."
03/13/2021,stocks,But then I lose all my positions.
03/13/2021,stocks,"Webull gives your info to the chinese government, so if youre cool with that then use them."
03/13/2021,stocks,I didnt have to mail in my options application
03/13/2021,stocks,"There app isn’t great, but it’s not horrible.  But I basically use yahoo finance to track and only go in the app to buy.

And seconded on the access to securities and to actually really own them, participate in voting, get warrant shares for your SPACs.

I was with Ally Invest for a bit - I liked them, but could buy any SPACs at all.

When you get to higher net worth and more valuable to fidelity, you can be eligible for IPO participation, which is something to look forward to.  Other brokers won’t have the relationship with the underwriter of the IPO"
03/13/2021,stocks,"Yeah I’ve rolled over several accounts, taxable and retirement, always been charged a transfer fee and have always been reimbursed. Nobody should be recommending liquidating positions in a taxable account."
03/13/2021,stocks,"I've been with Schwab for 10 years now and I'm very happy with them.  
Excellent customer service.  They really take care of you.    


Website research is a little clunky, but I've never really used my broker's resources for DD.  I jump around quite a bit for that.  Marketbeat, NASDAQ, finviz, etc..."
03/13/2021,stocks,"With that small of a pot though, if you were worried about the fee, I'd just liquidate it and close the account.  Screw em.  lol"
03/13/2021,stocks,"Can't you open a new account with a new broker, deposit cash, buy, then pull in your other account?  
I'd go crazy if I didn't have access to trade for up to 3 weeks.  
I'd lean towards more of an 'account transition' instead of a full-blown transfer."
03/13/2021,stocks,"I sent a secure email from their website asking for it to be reimbursed. I was really nice and told them how excited I was about working with a more established and professional broker. I have a very diverse portfolio spread across several stocks and I too heard that it needed to be over 25k to get reimbursed but I heard that here, not from fidelity. It took about a week for them to even respond to the email. But when they did, the next business day I saw the credit."
03/13/2021,stocks,"I just went through my RH statements back to December and no, no charge at all.

Even if they had, Fidelity will reimburse it."
03/13/2021,stocks,That was my experience. They cashed out all the fractionals which was irritating as I had some fractionals of $500+ companies that I was not planning on selling yet.
03/13/2021,stocks,"*may the odds ever be in your favor*

Maybe they can have the app pop up Charlie Munger himself"
03/13/2021,stocks,"Yes it's listed in their terms, $75. Most brokerages will reimburse. Look to Merrill edge, Fidelity, Schwab, TDa, and Vanguard for big boy accounts. Public, webull, or Firstrade for starter accounts."
03/13/2021,stocks,"I’m wrong. There are no fees on stock trading. There are only fees on option contracts.

03/13/2021,stocks,"But selling everything transferring and rebuying is faster, but still takes like 5 days for the money to completely be accessible and you have to pay those taxes. If your account isn’t too big and you want to move quicker in order to take advantage of short term stock movement, you might want to sell out and rebuy, pay the taxes and get those profits(or losses)."
03/13/2021,stocks,This is seriously messed up. This should not be a chargeable service.
03/13/2021,stocks,I’m about to look it up. I didn’t think they could charge you that much to move YOUR money.
03/13/2021,stocks,If you transfer your positions. Why not sell and move your money out then open new account? That doesn't cost anything

03/13/2021,stocks,"Same here, I use a couple other resources for DD, but after two other brokers, I settled on Schwab over their customer service.  It is indeed excellent.   Also, since they took over TD, they have held off improvements to things such as their app, and their research tools, presumably to more easily assimilate TD's with theirs.   I expect those will be improving down the road."

03/13/2021,stocks,Might have to give that a shot
03/13/2021,stocks,You should look up the ways robinhood makes revenue. Way more insidious than $75 transfer fees
03/13/2021,stocks,Yes you can a lot of brokerages charge transfer fees
03/13/2021,stocks,You can move your money for free. There’s a cost to move the rest of your positions through an ACAT transfer.
03/13/2021,stocks,what if you bought those positions at a much lower price then what it is now. You would have to start all over again
03/13/2021,stocks,Taxes
03/13/2021,stocks,"Two reasons

1) that's a taxable event. Really not good when you're going for long term hold.

2) rh only allows $50k transferred out per day."

03/13/2021,stocks,Do you use street smart edge?
03/13/2021,stocks,"Fortunately I don't have to deal with RH, but I don't have a hard time believing you 😁 
Still 75$ transfer fee is unheard of where I live that's why I was so surprised."
03/13/2021,stocks,Yeah just looked it up it is $75. Didn’t know that. Seems a bit ridiculous.
03/13/2021,stocks,"No you keep your gains if you sell at $20 and rebuy at $20 then your portfolio stays the same.
 the tax man does get his share when you buy and resell so depending on your situation it may be cheaper to pay the $75"
03/13/2021,stocks,"No, just the regular web interface."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Some brokerages charge a lot more than that, it’s a lot harder to transfer securities than money more regulation and what not."
03/13/2021,stocks,"I’m really fucking dumb so please go easy on me...

Other than tax reasons, isn’t there no disadvantage in selling and losing your position? I mean I know that share prices may go up in the amount of time it takes to open the new account and transfer money but they may go down too so I’ll call that a wash. But I will be buying at a higher share price, granted with gains from my previous average share price, but does this have any effect on long term growth?"
03/13/2021,stocks,"The biggest problems I can think of are:  
1) Short term holdings are charged at a higher tax rate. So if you've been holding for less than a year and plan on for the long haul, it's best to transfer.    
2) it may take days to withdraw the funds from Robinhood. If the market is up, you will lose money"
03/13/2021,stocks,Dividends could be missed depending when you sell/buy back in.
03/13/2021,stocks,"As long as you don't mind waiting a month to buy back any positions you sold for a loss (Wash Sale Rule).   Also, you'll have capital gains on any you sell for a profit, which will be a waste if you actually meant to hold them through the year.

Just transfer.   Even from slow-ass RH my holdings only took a couple of business days to transfer over.   Make sure everything is settled first, though (don't buy/sell anything for a couple days).   Remember ""T+2"".  They won't transfer a holding that hasn't settled yet.   If you wait until it's been two days since your last buy or sell, it's very easy.   Initiate the transfer from your new broker.   If you feel you'll miss out on something you want to buy over those couple days,  just buy it through your new broker."
03/13/2021,stocks,"No it doesn't. You still have the same amount invested. Lets say you spent $1000 on stock x. That bought you 100 shares.  Now you are transferring your account. Stock x has doubled since your purchase. So when you sell you have $2000, you open a new account and rebuy at the same price you sold. 100 shares at $2000. If the price doubles again you have $4000 off your investment of $1000. Now on your new account it will show 100% gain compared to your old account would say 300% but the dollar amount would be the same"
03/13/2021,stocks,Luckily I don’t own any dividend stocks anyway. I plan on investing in dividends though
03/13/2021,stocks,"Wrong.

If you have 20 shares, every time the stock goes up $1 you go up $20.

If you have just 10 shares, the same $1 increase only gives you $10.

So changing your entry point is huge."
03/13/2021,stocks,But you have the same amount of shares at the same entry point. Just because you sell and and rebuy that doesn't change the initial entry point
03/13/2021,stocks,"Yes it does.

2021-03-13 15:37:28,stocks,"Assistance in Understanding Stock Buyback and Issuance of Stock Hi everyone,

I am a NOK shareholder and recently received an e-mail about an upcoming annual shareholder meeting.

In the profile there are two proposals:

Proposal #1: Authorizes the Board of Directors to issue shares and special rights to issue shares.

Proposal #2: Proposal to authorize Board of Directors to buyback shares. 

Both proposals indicate that either the buy-back or issuance would involve 550 million shares or not to exceed 10% of total share volume. 

Both authorizations would be effective until October, 2022.

Both proposals also note that ...”terminate the authorization for repurchasing the company’s share granted by the Annual Meeting on 5/27/2020.” and “...terminate the authorization of issuance of shares and special rights granted by Annual Meeting on 5/27/2020.”

Can anyone help me understand these proposals?

Are shareholders voting to permit both of these or just one? If both are approved does it mean the company will buy back shares with the ability to reissue until 10/22? Or just one of these things?

Just trying to understand the possible outcomes of these proposals.

I will note that NOK is a bit of a meme stock and all I’m seeing are people hyping the ‘buy back’ element while ignoring the issuance of shares proposal.


Any help or information greatly appreciated."
03/13/2021,stocks,"I would imagine that one or the other would pass. You'd either be for buyback or reissue. Generally a buyback is good for shareholder value, but with Nokia in particular, I'd be open to issuing more shares. Dilution obviously isn't ideal, but they could really use the cash to get back on track after a disastrous past few years."

Especially when the law office goes out of its way to get people hooked with a free call. If it was a big deal and had merit they wouldn't need to remind people. They are doing it to pull in more suckers. 

It doesn't help that about 10 of these were posted in all the investing subs after the merger was announced. Almost suspicious considering the terms of the merger have been known for months."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Why is the SEC the only one that matters? 

As for the free calls, that's how class action lawsuits work. They can't actively go out and search for people, but need them to contact them first. 

>It doesn't help that about 10 of these were posted in all the investing subs after the merger was announced

What does this even mean? Before a merger is announced there is nothing to really look into. And making announcements causes significant volatility. 

>if it isn't SEC looking into criminal activity then it is garbage

Another garbage statement. So if someone is pulled over by a corrupt cop who claims they were speeding when they we not, and the Police department refuses to look into it - then what the cop did doesn't matter?"
03/13/2021,stocks,"What do you mean nothing before the merger is announced? The merger was announced months ago. Why are they doing it now? Because there is news about the merger so this should drum up some business while it is in the spotlight?

You actually have no evidence of anything they are accusing TLRY of. You have no leads or findings. Nothing has been announced other than the lawsuits. You are arguing from a baseless stance. If there really was criminal activity and they wanted to win, they would involve the SEC to give their suite merit. If the SEC finds wrong doing, the lawsuits would be a slam dunk. The fact that the SEC announced nothing shows they are just trying to get suckers, like yourself, to buy into it. They didn't even say they were working with the SEC. I assume you are one of the suckers because you are defending the baseless claims so hard.

Also, comparing a corrupt cop with no evidence making a claim in this situation would make the lawyers the corrupt cop. A fact less claim with no evidence that they don't want the SEC to investigate.

-separate emotions (don’t cry over money, it will never cry for you)

-don’t rely on the money you put into the market, treat it like an asset
-know what “margin” is and how it can both help and hurt you
-never copy someone’s portfolio (what works for them may not work for you)
-have some fun with it. It’s ok to follow the hype from time to time
-always have an exit strategy (stop loss)
-do your own research (DD)
-try to keep greed and FOMO low. (I set an alert for when a stock reaches a certain % gain then either sell or hold depending on what news is out there)

If you are so inclined, once you have a better fundamental understanding of the market, you can always move into individual growth stocks.

>they’re either specialized in one sector and do badly
If that specific sector does badly

This is literally the entire point of an ETF. What you’re trying to do is hand pick stocks in sectors and hope that you get lucky. An ETF does that for you. What you’re doing is riskier and really doesn’t have any benefits unless you understand why you’re buying the specific stocks instead of an ETF.

My main point is if you aren’t doing deeper research to find out which companies could outperform others in their sector then you should just buy ETFS. 

30-50 stocks is a lot."
03/13/2021,stocks,SFT?
03/13/2021,stocks,Downvotes say otherwise
03/13/2021,stocks,"I am doing research on the stocks I pick. I’m not blindly buying stocks hoping they blow up. 

In my research as it pertains to how many stocks that you should own, there is no consensus as to how many is too many. As long as you can do adequate enough research on all of them and keep up with news related to those companies, it’s perfectly fine. There are professional investors that hold 100 stocks or more in a portfolio. There’s no set amount you have to own. 

As for ETF’s, as I said before, stocks statistically have better gains than ETF’s and don’t charge you any fees for holding them."
03/13/2021,stocks,Lmaoo “the downvotes have spoken.”
03/13/2021,stocks,"Right, but again choosing an ETF is much safer and requires much less effort. You obviously aren’t a professional as you’ve been trading for 2 months. If you really think you can time the market and pick the right lottery numbers, by all means you do you. 

You’re right there isn’t an amount of stocks that’s the right amount to own, you need to be able to research the ones you’re in. Being in 50 companies is going to make that impossible. You can try and argue with me that you are a god who can do it, but we’ve all been here longer than you and know that with 2 months experience you’re going to get fucked.

And let me put this in a really logical way for you. How would an ETF outperform its underlying assets? Its literally impossible. Of course you can find individual stocks that outperform ETFS, thats basic logic. Trying to pick these stocks as a novice investor is a bad idea.

Good luck to you, I’m sure you won’t change what you’re doing because of this."
03/13/2021,stocks,"I’m receptive to everything you’re saying. I know that in far from an expert and I’m open to advice. I’m just trying to understand a few things. 

1) If my portfolio is diversified and I own stocks from several different sectors of the market, how would I get fucked unless the market crashes or a company somehow goes under and for whatever reason I wasn’t aware of it in enough time to sell? 

2) ETF’s may be “safer” options, but they also charge you fees for managing the ETF. If I’m picking high quality companies, I don’t believe that to be the same as “picking lottery numbers”. Plus I’m not really timing the market because I’m a longterm investor. I plan to contribute monthly and hold these stocks for the next 20-30 years. If you’re diversified and not investing in speculative assets or meme stocks and the like, it’s very hard to lose money in the market. 

I appreciate everything you’ve said and I’m certainly not writing any of it off. It seems like everyone’s approach is a bit different. Everyone has their own idea of what you should do."
2021-03-13 14:54:30,stocks,"Considering putting my stimulus towards a long call option for Apple. Any tips? Hi! I’m looking to buy an Apple call option and I’m leaning towards one that expires next January with a strike of $120. This should run me about $1600 but I feel like it’s a solid investment. If the stock tanked and I lost it all it wouldn’t be the end of the world so
I’m okay with putting this much in.

Just looking for some tips regarding if this is a reasonable choice and how I should
go about deciding when to close my position. I’m newer to options but I’ve been researching them heavily for the last month or so and feel confident enough to start buying. Thanks for your help!"
03/13/2021,stocks,"That trade will likely work out for you, as long as diversification is irrelevant to you aapl is a good company. It's hands off which is nice"
03/13/2021,stocks,"Sounds like you’ve done your homework.   The recent dip may provide a good entry point.  Apple is less up and down than other tech stocks because it actually has a huge revenue base.  The good is that it’s unlikely to fall too far, the bad is it probably won’t rocket up either"
03/13/2021,stocks,I have a couple calls in the 120-160 range. I’m pretty certain there’ll be a big influx of money into the market in the next few weeks and Apple is definitely a company that will continue to grow. These apple calls are my first too so I guess that tells you something about apple - it’s a safe bet. I checked out an options profit calculator and if it reaches 180 before Jan 2022 that’s an easy 4k profit. To me seems quite likely that will happen. Break even would be about $136 which is fairly safe considering we hit 145 earlier this year
03/13/2021,stocks,Would personally buy more out of the money. That being said - if I were buying options today would be looking at oil companies. Have not kept up with commodity gains and massive supply imbalance. Calls on oxy would be my bet.
03/13/2021,stocks,Save your calls for stocks that move better over time. Just my opinion.
03/13/2021,stocks,"Just one thing... Theta will work against u here, I usually go either a bit deeper in the money (yes, lower leverage), or if I buy ATM I then sell far OTM call to be theta neutral... (PMCC)."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Buying calls, ITM LEAPS is arguably the safest and simplest way to get into options as they most closely resemble being long the shares.

In terms of AAPL, there was a period between about 2008 - 2013 (I don't remember the exact years) where AAPL was engaged in share repurchases making longer term options contracts possibly superior to stock.

However, AAPL is paying a dividend now.  So, you would be missing out on that with the contracts.

It just comes down to risk/reward.  If you want very low risk, buy the shares.  If you want a little more risk, by the ITM contracts struck around $80.  If you want moderate risk, by the $120s.  If you want a lot of risk, by the $150s."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Nah, no tips. I may donate mine to a local food bank. I did that with my $1200 last year."
03/13/2021,stocks,Sounds expensive
03/13/2021,stocks,Just make sure the call is DeepOutOfTheMoney
03/13/2021,stocks,I don't think apple would tank but have you kept up with apple tech and marketing news to feel confident in them?
03/13/2021,stocks,"This is what’s wrong with the stimulus, if it’s not needed for hardship because of job loss, and as you said if you lost it all then it would t be the end of the world, then it shouldn’t be given to people. America is digging a deeper hole in debt that all of you will be paying off in higher taxes for generations to come. What a waste of money"
03/13/2021,stocks,Apple is still looking pretty overpriced
03/13/2021,stocks,"I have a question. So when I plug apple into an options calculator it’s not showing the break even at $136, even though that’s what it’s showing it would be on Webull. Am I not using the calculator properly, or is like $136 just the breakeven point not including any extrinsic value?"
03/13/2021,stocks,"actually I think I understand, it’s the break even when it expires! Wasn’t looking at the end date haha"
03/13/2021,stocks,Appreciate it thanks! I’ll look into itm calls!
03/13/2021,stocks,I might donate mine to the Red Cross.
03/13/2021,stocks,So is that stimulus check a per year thing? I’m from Europe so I don’t really know how that works for people in USA. Just asking to know about it.
03/13/2021,stocks,"Good for you, my friend. The world would be a better place with more people like you in it."
03/13/2021,stocks,That’s a good point! I will look more into their recent news and such. I had mostly been basing my decision on my general belief in the company and their prospects but I will do more research on specifics.
03/13/2021,stocks,Uhh okay? Just looking for stock advice lmao.
03/13/2021,stocks,Yes the break even is your strike price plus the premium you paid. So in your case it would be $120 strike plus $16.00 premium for contract = $136. No need for a calculator to figure this out.
03/13/2021,stocks,"red cross is a bad organization to donate to, there are plenty of better ones"
03/13/2021,stocks,"Government issues stimulus cheques to help people that have been affected by the lockdown. It’s supposed to help people to pay for their necessities e.g rent,food,etc. It depends on the government on how often and how much they want to give out to their citizens. 

It’s not on a per year basis, before 2020 the government didn’t issue any stimulus as people were financially fine"
03/13/2021,stocks,Salvation Army then.
03/13/2021,stocks,unironically worse? are you gonna say march of dimes next LOL
03/13/2021,stocks,"Truthfully, it would probably be my local pet shelter.  We eat too many animals, it’s about time we gave back."
03/13/2021,stocks,Breast cancer foundation.
2021-03-13 14:08:51,stocks,"What would you consider to be best value play currently in the pharmaceutical sector?  I'm currently trying to increase my exposure in the pharmaceutical sector and am debating between the following companies (ABBV, MRK, BMY, PFE). What would be your top picks and why? 

ABBV: Facing LOE on Humira but currently trying their best to diversify with the purchase of Allergan

BMY : bought Celgene to get into cancer therapy

PFE: Major covid vaccine producer. Return to normality should reduce the company's SP."

Its definitely made a difference in my life"
03/13/2021,stocks,"I’m pretty excited about TMO and believe they are significantly undervalued. They’re not a pharmaceutical company, but they have the benefit of supplying a host of them. It’s akin to selling picks and shovels to the gold miners. You don’t have to pick the winner of R&D/trials. You just know that many companies are spending a lot of coin to get there, and companies like this are the beneficiaries. With over 90% of shares held by institutions, smart money seems to agree."
03/13/2021,stocks,"SENS for sure. FDA approval is coming and will rival DexCom in years to come. It’s more of a long game, Been sitting around $3 now, but looking for $12-15 EOY."

03/13/2021,stocks,"I am really interested in AGRX and bought some shares to see how it goes.  They have had a roller coaster go of it over the years but I think now is the turn.  Finally awarded FDA approval and they are starting a marketing campaign to get their product advertised more.   They missed on earnings in the last report but the FDA approval was in Dec. I don't think sales had picked up yet.  Also, I don't think it can go any lower at this point. :)"

03/13/2021,stocks,"My pick has been Seelos Therapeutics because if their SLS- 002 trials go through positively, it can be a good sign for a new class of antidepressants (ketamine based). Ketamine's positive effects have been known for some time and now they are ""being put to the test"".

There is a huge demand for this as there is a large segment of people who need acute help for their suicidal ideation and another large segment for whom the other class of antidepressants don't seem to provide a significant positive effect.

Personally, I've used 4 different types of antidepressants and none of them have had a positive effect so I'm bullish also from the point of view of my personal experience.

03/13/2021,stocks,"Both GSK and RHHBY seem good from a return on investment and P/E standpoint, but I’m too much of an amateur to know if the rest of their fundamentals are good enough or not and need to do more study and research"
03/13/2021,stocks,"I get it, because you’re a bull."
03/13/2021,stocks,I do like TMO but it's way too pricey for my taste right now. I prefer TMO at a foward PE of 18 or lower :#
03/13/2021,stocks,ABT isn't in pharmaceuticals though? They make medical devices but i don't think they develop any drugs?
03/13/2021,stocks,"Ok, I can’t argue with that. I hold a little nonetheless."
2021-03-13 12:22:58,stocks,Fedex calls question. I have 7 280 4/16 calls for fedex. From everything I've read they're supposed to blow there expected earns out but they beat last time and the stock dropped. I'm wondering if I should sell before earnings on the 18th or hold through or even sell some before and hold some after? Any insight would be helpful.
03/13/2021,stocks,"If your up, sell before earnings if earnings are expected to be stellar. The stock will price in the earnings statement beforehand."
03/13/2021,stocks,A lot of times stocks will run up to the earnings and then people secure gains. There is also noise with the IV crush that happens after earnings as market makers have new information to build off of. I don’t know how close earnings are to your expiration but I’m not always a fan of holding through earnings especially if you have a run up leading to earnings. Cut for gains and then reassess after you get new information
03/13/2021,stocks,That's what I was thinking too. Thank you
03/13/2021,stocks,I'm still learning options. But I'm thinking you are right.  Last time they had a large drop off after earnings.  Thanks

03/13/2021,stocks,I’ve been back and forth on getting 100 shares of Apple. The options payout are just ok so I’m on the fence
03/13/2021,stocks,I agree. Especially meme stocks and cannabis stocks. I think the rise is APHA this week will continue next week. I own 200 shares and am holding off buying more because I think there will be a cool down.
03/13/2021,stocks,"you've got the history of 2 previous stimulus checks in the last year.  Instead of basing it on how you or anyone here feels, why not go and look at the timing of those, and then make a better informed guess?"
03/13/2021,stocks,I think the amount of people putting $ into the stock market is vastly overestimated. This is the last stimulus. People need food and to pay rent. Just my 2 cents on this supposed “stimulus boom” coming next week. I think the run from November to February was based off stimulus coming.

03/13/2021,stocks,Well im in for that stuff now :/ lol
03/13/2021,stocks,I also think the price of GME is too high for retail to move much higher. Not nearly as many people wanna pay $300 a share as in January.
03/13/2021,stocks,That poll asked 400 retail investors what they were gonna do with their check. I think 50% is a serious overstatement for the general population.
03/13/2021,stocks,"I picked up some trade options in cannabis stocks and zynga, hoping those will flip for some profit."
03/13/2021,stocks,"That’s not cheaper, just lower share price. GOOG is $2000/share but far cheaper than AMC."
03/13/2021,stocks,Agreed. GME needs to drop below $100 again before a flood of casual investors throw their stimulus at it.
03/13/2021,stocks,Im long ZNGA options. $12/ $15JAN is pretty cheap for the upside. The CEO is taunting for a large cap to but them out pretty often.
03/13/2021,stocks,Which way are you calling it?
03/13/2021,stocks,"Way better wording, thank you. They will go for the lower cost per share."

03/13/2021,stocks,"Im thinking they will go up, between cannabis and zynga being a known and cheaper game developer"
03/13/2021,stocks,"Agreed, its not money they earned so who cares if it blows up especially if it's a chance they can hit the lotto w/it"
03/13/2021,stocks,I agree but I’m too much of a pussy to trade options
03/13/2021,stocks,Normally I am too! This just really seemed like a good time to get a good buck with out 1000 dollars for me lol
2021-03-13 12:03:41,stocks,"I am so confused as to why my cost basis went up after selling low and buying high I’m new to trading and screwed up - I panic sold 1,100 shares for $15.70 and bought back in at an average of roughly $16.40. My original cost basis was $17.44 but somehow it is $19.44 now??? I did the math and I only lost $700 on the trade."
03/13/2021,stocks,Wash sale rule cost basis adjustment
03/13/2021,stocks,"As others have said, wash sale rule. If you buy at 18 and sell at 16 you have lost 2 dollars per share. This is a capital gains loss and can be written off on your taxes. If you buy the stock again within 31 days you can no longer write it off on your taxes so instead they add the 2 dollars per share to the cost of your future purchase. This way you are making 2 dollars less per share to make up for it. If you made 3 dollars per share on the 2nd purchase it would only look like 1 dollar per share and so the taxes paid would be 1 dollar per share rather than 3. 

Hopefully this helps."
03/13/2021,stocks,"I started trading last year and didn't know about wash sales, Robinhood doesn't really help with it if you're new and using that (which I was) then you can get screwed."
03/13/2021,stocks,"I’ve been trading for 5+ years and recently got screwed on a wash sale. Sold arkk for a 1k loss but somehow wash sale rule was triggered. I’d never sold arkk prior, and the only other ark I sold was arkg for a few hundred dollar gain. I’ve spent hours trying to figure out what happened, and was on hold for 45 minutes with ameritrade but couldn’t speak with anyone."
03/13/2021,stocks,Definitely a wash sale. Basically it makes it so you can’t hide your losses to the IRS and they combine total losses. Other than that I don’t really know. YouTube should help you out a lot
03/13/2021,stocks,"Hi. It helps you. You lost 17.44-15.7= $1.74 per share when you sold it. You technically should be able to write 1100*1.74 = $1914 as a loss. But you can’t because you bought it back within 30 days. So that sucks. 

But ... they help you out a bit. They make your cost basis higher now at $19.44, not $16.40. So if you sell it at $18, for example, you will on paper realize loss. Not gain. But that’s only on paper for tax reasons. In reality you will still be holding you 18*1100. So nothing changes for you in terms of how much you actually lost. But for IRS it looks like you lost not gained so you don’t have to pay taxes."
03/13/2021,stocks,That doesn’t seem right to me. If your average was 17 and you re-bought at 16 it should come down not go up
03/13/2021,stocks,What does this and why is my $700 loss now a $2000 loss? Will this hurt or help me come tax season? I plan on selling my entire position for hopefully a profit in 3-4 months.
03/13/2021,stocks,"Read this response as it's pretty clear.  Before you say it wasn't a total of 2.00$, remember where you said you made 6-7 swing trades.... your cost basis were all over the place most likely and that's why you are having trouble trying to calculate it."
03/13/2021,stocks,You can’t buy it again within 30 days after selling it. You can buy it again on the 31st day to avoid a wash sale.
03/13/2021,stocks,Great explanation
03/13/2021,stocks,"So basically this is better because my cost basis increases, even though my transaction doesn’t and therefore I would pay less capital gains next year? 

All of this is assuming I close out my position in a couple of months for net profit.


I just don’t want to get screwed in taxes next year. I’m going to re-do my math on calculating my loss during the 6-7 swing trades."
03/13/2021,stocks,"I sold all of my shares. Average was $17.44, sold all 1,100 shares at $15.70, swing traded about 6-7 times to cut loses and my final average was buying back in at $16.40 after about 7-8 trades.


I don’t understand it either. Will this hurt me in tax season or help me? I plan on selling my entire position completely in about 3 months."
03/13/2021,stocks,I’d sell everything and learn more. Just blindly buying and selling and not understanding anything is not good.
03/13/2021,stocks,">So basically this is better because my cost basis increases

I think you're on to something here.  You can save a ton on taxes by making sure you never make a profit."
03/13/2021,stocks,"As long as you're in the position,  there is no tax benefit.  It's not necessarily better tax wise,  it's just the same without you being able to claim what you had already sold.  

As long as you sell and stay out for over 30 days,  you can claim the loss up to $3000/year."
03/13/2021,stocks,"I would say it's ""better"" yes because you still get to reflect the money that you have lost within your ""new"" cost basis."
03/13/2021,stocks,[Wash sale rule violation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/washsalerule.asp)
03/13/2021,stocks,"Oh okay, so say I sell it all in June and make $6000 profit, can I write off the $700 loss I took swinging it yesterday so long as I don’t enter the position again?"
03/13/2021,stocks,"I feel pretty retarded because I still don’t understand how my cost basis went from 17.44 to 19.44 on 1,100 shares with a net loss of $700 swing trading."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Gotta be more specific.  Here's an example of a wash where you could buy before selling. 

For this example let's say all this happens in a 30 day wash period.  Let's say you own 100 shares of a company at 10.00 and the price drops to 7.50. Let's say you buy an additional 100 shares at 7.50 and it drops to 5.00. If you buy a third lot of 100 shares at 5.00. If the stock goes up to 7.50 and you sell 150 shares (half.) Depending on your lot allocation, your cost will be adjusted.  If you do FIFO since the subsequent buys were within the 30 day period even though they happened before your sell your cost would be considered a wash because you sold 100 at a loss and 50 at a break even.  So the 50 shares would be a net 0. But the 100 shares cost would be added into the cost of the remaining position over 100 shares. Your balance 50 shares of the 7.50 purchase would adjust to 8.75. Your 5.00 cost balance (50 shares) would be 7.50 and the other 50 shares 5.00. 

This is how it gets confusing for wash Sales.  Now using that example,  if you sold 150 shares at 7.50 and allocated the lots to the 7.50 shares for 100 and 50 of the 5.00 lot. You would pay taxes on the 50 shares you profited off the 5.00 lot and the 7.50 would be a wash.  Your loss position is unrealized so no cost adjustment is made since now you realized a taxable gain. 

There are many other scenarios depending the lots you choose.  Just wanted to give you a quick scenario"
03/13/2021,stocks,"They are all right, you have a wash sale on your hands. What broker are you using? Fidelity? You can take off the adjusted rate by clicking the gear icon on the position page.  Then checking off the box - Unadjusted Cost Basis. Then you'll see your REAL cost basis.

It's all for tax purposes. So someone can't dump all their shares on Dec 31st at a loss, then buy them back Jan 1st for a possible future profit."
03/13/2021,stocks,You need to look at the individual lots purchased/sold. You cannot go by the total average. Your broker should have a breakdown of the individual lots.
03/13/2021,stocks,"Be glad you did the wash sale on one account and not across multiple brokerages, creating limitless possibilities for headaches when it comes time to do your taxes"
2021-03-13 11:22:09,stocks,"Does TD Ameritrade have a time machine?? Something potentially sketchy happened with my account. Can anyone explain to me what happened here?  I sold a covered call on DAL, 3/12 expiration with a strike price of 50.  DAL hit a high of 49.86 on 3/12, the option should have expired without being exercised.  It's currently 4am on 3/13 and my TD account shows that the option was exercised and I sold 100 shares of DAL at 50.  What is weird is that it's time stamped for 2:21am on 3/15 (again, it's 3/13).  
  Any ideas on why TD is making future trades involving an option that should have just expired?  I'm trying to understand what happened before I call to complain."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Options can be exercised after hours. Since it was so close to the strike price it isn't unreasonable for someone to exercise.

Edit: to add https://www.google.com/amp/s/investorplace.com/2010/02/options-expiration-options-dont-expire-on-friday/amp/"
03/13/2021,stocks,Congratulations.  Presumably you sold your shares for a profit and you aren't even sure how all this stuff works. Nicely done as that is the goal - to make money.  This feels kinda anxious and impatient though.  Take a weekend or day away and don't sweat small increments so much or I worry how much sleep you will lose when it is a big increment lost/misunderstood.
03/13/2021,stocks,"Options has the potential to be exercised after hours. In your case, it looks like at 4:45pm EST, it did trade at 50.08ish(?) and most likely, If you sell a call, you have the **obligation to sell the stock** at a specific price per share within a specific time frame — that’s only if the call buyer decides to invoke their right to buy the stock at that price.    

It could be that the buyer did an early assignment near close to gamble that the price would jump ITM after hours? Or it could be there is a dividend incoming? Either way, Options technically have up to a time to exercise/assigned after hours.    

[ This youtube link basically explains why or what happens if your options doesn't close if it is near money especially if there was news that made DAL jump to $50.05 that got you that assignment after hours ](https://youtu.be/rtVFj9nRRDo)"
03/13/2021,stocks,"Yea most likely it was an after hours assignment. The clearing house will randomly select the broker who randomly, or otherwise fair process, selects the shareholder. 

In the future you should hedge your wins to control your action and trade plan. Around 2pm you could have spent a few bucks to close out that contract. Then sold another with a further out date or hold onto your shares for the time being. I usually clip contracts at 85-90% gains. Called managing winners. Just a word of advice"
03/13/2021,stocks,"When you sell any option, ITM or not you can get assigned/called away (whatever) There is a random process for picking who gets assigned when people who are long exercise  early...maybe yours got hit cause it was close anyways, who knows. 

I have read on it before, and I think it’s the exchange that randomly assigns a number of assignments to which broker  and then they do what they do to pick their customers who get the bag. I don’t remember it all. 

I’ve had strategies on with as much as a week left and one leg gets assigned. It’s very rare but it can happen.

Edit: it just says 15th cause of the weekend probably, I don’t think it’s malicious."
03/13/2021,stocks,Exercised because it was close to being in the money. Congrats on the profit.
03/13/2021,stocks,"The uncertainty on whether an option is exercised is usually avoided by buying to close an option. This is free on TDA when the option is bought to close below $0.05.

The underlying was probably trending higher after hours, or the owner of the option just felt like exercising just to see how it is. Assignment can happen at any time for any reason. It is a risk to consider when selling options, especially if it is part of a complex options trade.

My deep ITM calls are getting assigned. The timestamp is 03/14 23:19:55 PDT. No biggie, same result come Monday."
03/13/2021,stocks,"So being an after hours trade, it wouldn't be processed Monday and this why it's time stamped for a future date?   
  Why would someone exercise an OTM option?  They could have bought the same shares for at least $15 if they didn't exercise."
03/13/2021,stocks,"This seems like the most plausible explanation to me,  but I'd err on the side of caution and contact the brokerage just to get the story and timeline absolutely straight. The 221am on Monday element has me scratching my head."
03/13/2021,stocks,Nice article attached.  Thanks!
03/13/2021,stocks,"This. Early assignment or invoked before close due to a news, dividend, anything that the buyer would have possibly known (gambled) there's a chance of a price action after hours."

03/13/2021,stocks,That makes sense. I’ve been with them for 8 years but Friday was the first time I needed to call about something. The only thing that really annoys me is that you don’t have the option of receiving a call back instead of just waiting on the phone the whole tome
2021-03-13 11:10:26,stocks,"Does a market crash affect the companies? I was wondering if it's just us investors that panic during a crash, or are the actual companies affected as well? Are they more susceptible to failure and/or bankruptcy when their market cap drops significantly?"
03/13/2021,stocks,"Stock prices decline for a number of reasons , but if the overall market declines significantly, it usually for Marco economic reason. Having said that, a sharp decline in certain stocks does not necessarily mean the business is in decline,  companies can be affected negatively if they need to access the capital markets, but if a company has a strong balance sheet , and the business fundamentals are intact, the stock price decline could be a buying opportunity,  but if the opposite is true, could spell trouble. 
When the indexes trade down , a lot of times it is people exiting positions and they don’t want to be the last person standing, this is a potential for buying"
03/13/2021,stocks,"Well, a lot of companies own stocks themselves."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Definitely when people go into conservation mode and spend less dollars. Small businesses may start less frequently, some go out of business, commercial real estate hurts...construction companies (the shell subsidiaries they create to develop) fold up, people lose jobs, stop paying bills. yeah it can trickle down everywhere depending on the premise."
03/13/2021,stocks,Of course it affects them.. Is this satire
03/13/2021,stocks,"In layman’s: a company issued their stock to raise money for the business. Once that stock is issued, they do not profit off of the share price rising. Most companies own a ton of their own stock, so they are vulnerable to price swings by way of owning shares of their own company. I’m not going to get into secondary offerings, share buybacks, etc. However, I think that’s the skinny of your question."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Yes.

How it affects them depends on the company.

A market crash could theoretically benefit a strong company.  Its management could view its depressed price as opportunity to engage in aggressive share buybacks.

On the other hand, for a weaker, struggling company, a market crash could cripple this type of company because the reduced share price will affect its ability to raise additional capital if it needs the money to survive."
03/13/2021,stocks,bro....
03/13/2021,stocks,"Your cause and effect is backwards. The last two market crashes were because of major real world problems for the companies, which affected the stock prices. 

If you’re referring to the pullback across tech and clean energy from the last month, no that doesn’t affect the companies."
03/13/2021,stocks,It depends. Covid crash / financial crisis was in regards to fears of companies going under. Dotcom was over valuation.
03/13/2021,stocks,I will never say macro economics again. From now on it is Marco economics.
03/13/2021,stocks,POLO
03/13/2021,stocks,"So a crash might actually be a valuable insight into a company's financials and guidance - if they start buying back a ton of their own stock during a crash, that's a sure sign of good health. And if they're not buying back, the opposite is the case?"
03/13/2021,stocks,"Sure, but if a crash is followed by a bull market the stock itself will recover within a year or so. I was wondering if it affects their financials in any significant way. If the general economy is still healthy enough and people continue buying their products or services, would a 30-50% drop in the stock market pose a danger to the company?"
03/13/2021,stocks,"Maybe I should elaborate. I don't mean a crash in the economy necessarily, I just mean a crash that's more or less isolated to the stock market. I.e. were any companies threatened last March when their market cap dropped 30%, even if their earnings were more or less unaffected."
03/13/2021,stocks,"But as long as the company has enough cash and they don't need to sell the stocks they own, then it's just unrealized losses, right? Which won't cause any problems to the stability of the company as long as earnings are status quo?

I think my question is more along the lines of: If a company's market cap drops 40%, will the banks feel panicky and raise the interest rates on their loans?"
03/13/2021,stocks,Hi bro
03/13/2021,stocks,"There is Macro economics and Narco economics, but no Marco"
03/13/2021,stocks,"If they buy back stock, usually a good sign, but if they don’t, it is not the opposite , they could be keeping their powder dry to acquire a competitor that is in financial difficulty or they may have capital expenditure needs.  This is why you need to know if it is good management , do they have a buyback in place or get an emergency  increase etc.  valuable insight into the company , you really should read the financial statement and understand the industry they are in. The stock price does not always represent the intrinsic value of a company"

2021-03-13 10:32:06,stocks,"Company’s getting broken up? Over the last year or so I keep seeing people suggesting big companies like Amazon and Apple are too big and the government mine break them up. 


Realistically how would they do this and how would it look? Would they split Apple into phones and computers with a seperate company for Apple Music for example?
What would happen to shares? I imagine any news of this happening would make the stock price plunge."
03/13/2021,stocks,"When the government broke AT&T up into regional companies in the 80s, AT&T's book value fell by about 70 percent. However, owners of the stock were given shares in the new regional companies, which of course did very well, and overall those who held both their AT&T stock and the regional stocks saw 40-50% total returns over a couple years. 

If Amazon were broken up shareholders would probably get a similar arrangement, with one stock for the shopping business, one for web services and one for entertainment."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Apple is pretty safe - they’d likely only regulate the App Store.

Amazon they’d likely split off AWS (which doesn’t really solve the problem) and separate the fulfillment from Amazon basics - meaning the same company can’t own the platform and sell its own wares on it.

Keep in mind anti-trust is glacial and this will likely take years. The result may actually be good for shareholders, it was with the baby bells. The biggest risk in my mind is it is just a major distraction for the company. Gates is on record lamenting how Microsoft missed some market trends because they were so focused on the antitrust trial (granted they could just be using that as a scape goat/excuse)."
03/13/2021,stocks,"You would receive fractional shares from the new companies. If Facebook were to be split, you’d get like 0.3 shares of Instagram and 0.15 of Oculus. Don’t see any splits happening."
03/13/2021,stocks,I know lots of investors who own shares of google and Facebook hoping they get broken up.
03/13/2021,stocks,Fun fact: John Rockerfeller's wealth increased when they broke up Standard Oil.  His share of ownership in one company became his share of ownership in many companies.
2021-03-13 10:17:52,stocks,"Are penny stocks recommended for broke beginners who need experience and to increase their funds for trading? First off, I'm broke, lol, and at the moment can only afford to invest $100 at most.  I was wondering perhaps I could invest in penny stocks while learning the basics about the stock market and trading.  Then eventually as I gain more experience and make enough profit, I can invest in the popular, higher priced stocks. Is this the best path for broke beginners or is there a better route?  I appreciate any advice anyone's willing to give me.  Thanks."
03/13/2021,stocks,"You’re much more likely to decrease your funds with penny stocks. However if you only have $100 to lose, now is a great time to learn that lesson the hard way. If you decide to believe me (or anybody with a brain) and steer clear of penny stocks, you’re better off buying an index fund or a fractional share of a strong company.  $100 is going to grow slowly, so learn patience now. 

You should spend time focusing on improving your current financial situation so you have more money to invest; rather than trying to invest to improve your current financial situation."
03/13/2021,stocks,A paper trading account is what you need if what you are planning is day trading or swing trading. If not throw it in an index etf and keep adding money to it.
03/13/2021,stocks,"Bro no stay away from penny stocks until you get more experience, if you only have $100 then you probably shouldn’t be using it in the market right now especially if you don’t know anything. Use thinkorswim on Ameritrade, its free and allows you to use fake money and see how your plays turn out. Until you learn the basics why gamble away the little money you have? Learn how to do a basic call option, that would be the best play if you’re using $100 imo."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Sure but u need to consider that penny stocks are very volatile and they can crash anytime, the company can close anytime, etc.
It’s very risky but I think it’s worth 100$ to begin with!"
03/13/2021,stocks,My advise would be look at % gains vs # of shares esp since fractional shares are an option. $100 into pennystocks that goes up 5% is the same as $100 into a $200 stock that goes up 5%.
03/13/2021,stocks,"Penny stocks to start? Bro, your better off buying $95 dollars worth of coke, $5 worth baking soda and cooking crack. Return is about 95% profit every time."
03/13/2021,stocks,"I actually disagree with people here. I did this and used the funds from penny stock wins to buy quality companies. 

Just be aware that they are very volatile so if you are a scared person that will panic sell- don’t do it. 

Check out HITI , Numi , H20 Innovation"
03/13/2021,stocks,"Penny stocks don't really follow the same fundamentals as regular stocks. Their appeal is the low cost compared to explosive upside, typically based on a catalyst. 

It won't really teach you to DD companies, sectors, or environments as well. 

Your first goal should be consistently generating capital for more investing. A job, better savings plan, etc. As a new trader, just dividends will likely outperform you. I'd first find something safe to park that $100 in. (AAPL would be ideal if you could get a bit more money to do so) And practice paper trading."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Starting with a small amount doesn’t need to be a limitation. Even if you want to buy something with a share price above 100 dollars, you can. You just need a broker which allows you to have fractional shares."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Penny stocks are probably even harder to make any money from if you don’t know what you’re doing, as they’re prone to being pumped and dumped or to dramatically losing value.

More important to go in with the right mentality. If you’re trying to dramatically increase wealth with an amount like $100 it either needs to be long term and slowly, or taken as if you’re in the casino.

A better question is probably, can you consistently put $100 in? Do you have an ETF / fund account? Best to slowly build wealth if you’re that broke initially, before picking individual stocks - unless you’re prepared to gamble and risk losing it.

If you’ve done DD and believe in the future growth of individual stocks, a broker with fractional shares mean you can still go down that route. Obviously if you’re wanting to put it into AMZN, it would be a very small fraction of a share - but the percentage gains (or losses) would be the same."
03/13/2021,stocks,"I highly recommend that you don't do this. No disrespect intended, but if you invest without knowing what you are looking at, you are essentially just gambling. That is only magnified with penny stocks, as they tend to be WAY more volatile.

If you are interested in learning by trial and error, I suggest looking into Investopedia's simulator. You can ""invest"" as little or as much as you would like. Treat it as if it was your own money, and you will learn the same lessons without having to actually risk your money."
03/13/2021,stocks,Etfs are a great start!
03/13/2021,stocks,"Nope, it is a great way to stay broke!

Companies try to target minimum stock prices to stay on certain stock exchanges. They often create enough shares to start out the price the $10-$20 range. This makes it easy for people to buy into with whole shares and leaves room for the price to grow.

Companies don't start off below $5.

So when you see a penny stock, you see something that has struggled. It is on death watch, bankruptcy watch, or something is highly speculative about it.

Many of them die off.

What penny stocks do, however, is it generates alot of volatility and some people try to time short trades to make a profit off of the volatility. The problem is you're risking it could go down and not make it back up or go bankrupt. You don't want to be stuck with the hot potatoe.

There are also a few rare companies that fell off the radar, were on death watch, but had a speculative innovation and it roars back with HUGE gains. The problem is to find them you might have to pick a few hundred that go bankrupt or go nowhere.

Other risks are penny stocks aren't traded in the normal stock exchanges. There are less reporting requirements for many of them and there are some investors who are trying to use tiny speculative companies to scam investors. This makes it really hard to do a full due diligence on the company, unless you have a direct contact or in the industry with the business.

In short, do not start here! Even when you play here, only do it with a very small percentage of your portfolio you're ok with risking. They are high risk things and many of them will die off, but a rare few are striking gold. This is not where you want to risk your retirement plan or any money you need for an emergency.

&#x200B;

Start with an S&P 500 index ETF, like SPY. As you learn more branch out to more unique things.

The index ETF owns a piece of all of the 500 largest companies across many industries. It will be less risky and go up and down with the overall market. This will be the less risky place to be, while you learn more and feel comfortable your not going to make mistakes."
03/13/2021,stocks,would it be dumb to just buy the stocks i own with the preferred platform and just sell the old  ones on the crappy platform rather than pay a fee or wait for a transfer? do your stocks actually transfer over or do they sell them and transfer cash? wouldn't i ruin my average price either way unless they transfer everything? also a beginner and apreciate all info.
03/13/2021,stocks,If you’re new then open up a TD Ameritrade account and take on all the free classes and coursework to help you learn. Learn the market and fundamentals first then options. Small accounts can do big things with options. That’s where you want to be in my opinion. Accumulate any cash you can as you learn. You can also invest it in high volatile stocks but those that have good fundamentals. Def not penny’s. Gains are alwasy a percentage of what you invest. Doesn’t matter how many shares you own (dividend being exception and some options plays)

Stupidest thing I've ever done so of course it's panning out. But I hope to be back in $FSR soon and maybe $CIIC post-merger with a hell of a lot more shares.
03/13/2021,stocks,You won’t make any money on penny stocks. There’s nothing wrong with starting out with only one or two shares of an established and reputable company. You can even buy fractional shares to diversify that $100. Playing penny stocks is like playing the slot machines. You keep dropping money and watching things spin in circles only to end up losing it all.
03/13/2021,stocks,"Why not invest in lower priced stocks that have a strong potential?  Obviously your not going to buy Amazon at $3,000 or Tesla.   BlackBerry is a good company and it’s like 11 dollars per share.  Buy 5 shares and if it drops then keep buying more.  Even a company like BurgerFi is a safe bet,  I like Fisker for the EV market.

03/13/2021,stocks,Do not learn with penny stocks.  They are more difficult investments then blue chip companies.
03/13/2021,stocks,Get a brokerage that offers paper trading. Paper trading is is practice trading. I use Webull. It offers paper trading. Then you can figure out what you wanna do with that $100
03/13/2021,stocks,If you broker with fidelity you can do fractional shares and diversify with some good companies without having the funds for full stocks.
03/13/2021,stocks,"If you're broke enough that $100 is a lot then put together an emergency fund first, learn about personal finance if you haven't yet, and just do paper investing (meaning no actual money at stake) until you're in a more stable spot.

I know that tdameritrade offers something called thinkorswim that will let you do simulated investing, but I'm not sure what other options are out there. When you're actually in a place to invest, just keep in mind that those places benefit from day trading. 

Look up the difference between short-term capital gains and long-term capital gains. If you only invest in companies you're willing to hold for a year or more then you shouldn't be paying taxes on the gains unless you're making a lot of money. As an added benefit it helps keep you away from riskier things like options, margin trading, swing trading, or meme stocks."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Only if your willing to throw another $100 at it every time you lose. And yes, you will lose a lot. 

Honestly $100 really isn’t enough to invest with. I’m sorry but your better off saving that $100 for your emergency fund.

If you want to invest, stick to blue chip stocks."
03/13/2021,stocks,"You can also try putting your money in an ETF first, save some for a few months, get some small returns (relative safe). In the meanwhile you can start with paper trading, meaning fictive trading. You make a portfolio with the amount of money you actually want to start investing with and track your progress for a Q or 2. If you feel comfortable you can get your money out of the ETF and try some trading. Pennystocks are volatile meaning there is a high risk/reward. So you might want to try paper trading pennystocks and normal stocks, there is a huge difference in how the two work imo."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Never to broke to learn the game.

I’ve been learning the past few months and the best advice I can give you is to go at it at 100%

Drop 50 into VTI then the rest into apple and add to it. Then take 20 bucks and learn how options work"
03/13/2021,stocks,"This isn’t going to be popular advice, as it’s riskier than paper trading or ETFs; but when I started out I blew up my account and had about £60 left (in Plus500) and I bought options, specifically Apple Calls, to get back up to £500 and to give me a bit more breathing room."

If you have 100 bucks to gamble and wanna learn the market mechanics of buying and selling and have an experiential learn from it sure, but that 100 bux is only gonna get you a few trades after you pay commissions.  you might be better served to use an app like wealthsimple and trade low dollar canadian equities for the free execution and a little less risk."

This sub doesn't really like penny stocks but if you find a company you like and their financials check-out, why not?

I'm invested (can't name it here) in a penny stock that is the biggest retailer on their segment, has the best RoA (Return on Assets) of the industry and somehow is really undervalued compared to the other more know companies. 

I've had it go up 15%, down 30% and up 25% in the last month. I don't mind because I trully believe there are a lot of upcoming good news ahead and long term it just makes sense.

This sub somehow considers all risky investiments bad investiments but I only bought 3 stocks in my life, Tesla at 74$ (post split price), GM stop at 37$ and last month I also invested in a penny stock.

This sub would consider all of them bad inevstments. If you know the sector and you believe in something, invest.

I bought Tesla in December 2018, few months after everyone was calling for bankrupcy, even here. Invest in sectors you know, that's the main advice"

Use those 100$ to buy some books about investing principles. That is the best use of that money right now. On the other hand, learning about how the market works will make you money in the future. At the bare minimum you will not be making the kind of mistakes people at WSB brag about."

I have a question which might be silly but I don't understand why people would choose to invest in stocks that are lagging the SP500 despite their steady growth. I'm thinking about companies like Costco or Berkshire Hathaway. Do these people expect those companies to outperform in a distant future ? Or maybe it's a dividend thing ? Wouldn't they be better off with a SP500 ETF ?

Thanks for your insight"
03/13/2021,stocks,They're called value stocks. They have been doing quite well so far this year because growth stocks are over bought. It's really just a different investing strategy.
03/13/2021,stocks,Index funds are generally the best choice for the majority of people.
03/13/2021,stocks,"I look for a bargain, like apple right now is way off their highs and it’s not like they’re going anywhere. So I’d say them performing even as expected would be above where they’re currently priced. Stocks like this will individually move more than an index I would think, but I’m also fairly new to this."
03/13/2021,stocks,Because past performance doesn’t indicate future results. A company that lagged may not lag in the future. Look at Disney. Went sideways for years now is crushing it.
03/13/2021,stocks,"Indices are absolutely the safe option and there's nothing wrong with that. Best option for the majority of people. There are other indices besides those that have higher growth in the future, like the EV sector and LIT. Most of my money is in indices. 

There are companies and options out there than can outperform the market and if you're knowledgeable about that company and it's profile you can outperform an index no problem. I invested in Ford at 7.03 and it's currently almost doubled my investment in 6 months, S&P hasn't done that. 

If you research and are knowledgeable about a given company you can predict there future earnings and value with a reasonable certainty and beat the market as a whole. Don't be a gambler like the fools with GME, be an investor and you can knowledgeably beat the market, with a higher risk of course."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Absolutely. Percentages vary from person to person, but large blend index funds should be the bedrock of any healthy portfolio."
03/13/2021,stocks,"I have been saying this since I heard it for the first time, but I truly believe Apple will explode once they have something concrete to tell about developing their own car. I believe it will be hyped to Pluto."

2021-03-13 09:51:55,stocks,"Moderately priced bank stocks Hey fellas,

I am looking out for some banking stocks that are currently on a discount - despite from the obvious like eg JPM 

My goal is to profit from the upcoming increase in interest rates. Could be a golden age for banks in particular. 

Appreciate any suggestions or discussions! 

Cheers"
03/13/2021,stocks,"You are so late to the game on this one.

You should have bought some of the banks in 2020 when they were on a huge discount. 

Personally I own JPM and would advise you to buy if it’s goes down. It’s the best in breed. Even during the pandemic with close to 0% interest rates they have had monster earnings. The stock is bound to go up as rates increase. I’m expecting it to be over 200 dollars by next year."
03/13/2021,stocks,"These are some bank stocks that I like and are moderately priced. 

HSBC - $29.74 - It is currently one of the world's largest financial institutions with more than 39 million customers around the world. 

Truist Financial (TFC) - $59.92 - It is currently the sixth largest US commercial bank. Currently in process of cutting $1.6 billion in costs, which should improve the profitability and organic growth rate.

United States BanCorp (USB) - $54.64 - Currently rated the fifth largest bank in the US by deposits. Expanding into Southeast and Texas should improve growth.

Hilltop Holdings (HTH) - $39.37 - Fundamentally speaking, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade for Hilltop Holdings imply an improvement in the company's underlying business."
03/13/2021,stocks,Lloyds are still cheap in my opinion.
03/13/2021,stocks,"There are some great bank etfs if you wanted a broader range. If you want some good exposure to the big banks, XLF is great. There are also more aggressive options (leveraged) etfs such as BNKU and FAS. They hold all the big guns like jpm, ms, gs, bac, etc

Another route is regional banks. They have been exploding. KRE is a solid etf with good exposure to regionals. And the more aggressive play is DPST, which has been ripping it since September.

*edit* as for discounts, they are almost all at ATH. I do think there is alot of value in BAC and C. BAC is my favorite right now. It's also notably Warren's buffets  largest holding. And we all know that man can sniff out value."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Can you explain why banks will profit from an increasing interest rate?

From my perspective (european), a bank buys money from a bigger bank (EURO: ECB) and put their costs and their earningsmarge on top of the interest rate that they buy it for from the ECB.

Imo that means that a bank doesn't directly profit from a higher interest rate.

Hope someone can explain it to me, because what do I know ;)"
03/13/2021,stocks,"I agree that you’re a little late to the game on this one (sorry bud), but grab some shares of IAT (regional bank ETF) if you feel the need to jump into the financial play. 

From the linked article:
“... As banks seek to borrow money at short-term rates and lend at long-term rates, a steepening yield curve will earn more on lending and pay less on deposits, thereby leading to a wider spread. This will expand net margins and increase banks profits.

Given this, investors seeking to take advantage of the steep yield curve should bet on bank ETFs. These funds have gained in double digits over the past month...”

03/13/2021,stocks,I think you can squeeze more out of Wells Fargo. Morningstar has a $52 fair market value and I think you can get some money out of it even at this price
03/13/2021,stocks,I'm in JPM and BlackRock. BlackRock in particular looks juicy given the equity situation. There's some tension right now because of interest rates but honestly with the stimulus packages and potential infrastructure packages we could be at the start of a 10 year bull market. BlackRock will see crazy returns in that environment
03/13/2021,stocks,"Why banks?

Declining market facing regulatory and disruptive risk in a low earnings climate. Even with higher interest rates they were not giving good returns compared to the market.

And yes, as mentioned, you’re about 10 months too late unless you think dividends are good profit."
03/13/2021,stocks,"I bought jpm last year too. Mostly because of the yield at that time. 
I feel like I am not quite late to this cause the earnings will follow the interest which will cause the stock prices to rise. Correct me if I’m wrong.

Just feel like a single banking stock won’t do for me as I currently only own jpm."
03/13/2021,stocks,"I really like Pinnacle (PNFP). Smaller bank based out of Nashville with a stellar reputation and a lot of room to grow. It’s trading at 113% higher than last year.

03/13/2021,stocks,Think dpst is on a strong uptick or wait for a dip?
03/13/2021,stocks,"
Banks make more money in high interest rate environments because consumers that take out  loans have to pay that higher interest rate back to the bank."
03/13/2021,stocks,"In the EU as a Bank Customer the interest rates are usually fixed for a defined time. E.g. if you buy a house in Germany and need to borrow money from a bank you have a contract that the interest rate is x.x% for the next 10, 20, whatever years. 
These contracts with fixed interest rates don’t exist everywhere in the world.
To be able to rise the interest on existing loans is free money for the banks."
03/13/2021,stocks,Out of curiosity why do you say they’re undervalued? Both are at ATH market caps right now
03/13/2021,stocks,10 months late? Over one month JPM is up 9% and AAPL is down 10%. Could continue another month or more.
03/13/2021,stocks,"Goldman Sachs is great too but the stock is very pricey. 

I think the other big banks WFC, C , and BAC are ok. They haven’t really had an great quarters in awhile. They might even be overvalued IMO"
03/13/2021,stocks,"This is obviously not financial advice (lol), but I certainly think with the threat of increased interest rates and the economy reopening, that dpst still has lots of fuel left in the tank. 

But hey, sometimes stocks go up, sometimes they go down haha."
03/13/2021,stocks,But the banks also have to pay more to get the money to loan.
03/13/2021,stocks,"Ah, didn't know that was only european, thanks for clearing that up!"
03/13/2021,stocks,"Remember, I said undervalued, not underpriced. I go by S & P Global Market Intelligence for their valuation. For BMO for example EPS for the previous three quarters was 1.85, 2.41 and 3.06. Would I buy it? No, because another criteria I have is for a stock to be trading at the low end of its range, not the top."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Many CRE loans are variable rate loans that adjust when the prime rate goes up.  Also the cost of deposits doesnt automatically rise on existing deposits.  Think longer term CD's 1,3,5 yr on which the bank pays sub 1% interest on."

Would love to add a Korean stock to my international exposure. Anyone else buy in or know much about them?

Edit: so after doing a bit of research im thinking of waiting until/if it drops to around 35. Valuation seems extremely stretched right now"
03/13/2021,stocks,"People reading ""Amazon of country X"" and throw their money blindly in. I think there are better eCom plays than Coupang. They're limited to a single country with 52 million people. Compare that to the markets of AMZN, MELI, SE, BABA, JD or PDD."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Got in...founder led, maybe this doesn’t matter to others but he gave even the delivery folks stock.  My thinking is that when everyone working at the company has skin in the game...then they are gonna put more into the game. Sure not turning a profit now but how long did it take amazon to flip into the black? Some of the things Coupong is doing are ahead of Amazon...all that said let’s not forget Amazon is Not just Ecomm (AWS) so I don’t think I would buy this stock with that comparison but ecomm is here to stay and this company is doing it well."
03/13/2021,stocks,"There were a few posts about them the other day.. anyway, I bought 15 shares @47.95 on Friday just to see how it goes. I will add more if the stock price goes down further."

03/13/2021,stocks,"Everyone loves a headline relating to the next Amazon and it's true it can become a bit sensational. I do think though that these companies have a lot of loyalty in their customers which is why I think they're quite a good hedge for a long term play.

JUMIA is also another interesting case if you're looking for something similar but in an emerging market."
03/13/2021,stocks,Like the company but waiting until it hits 10-15 then I’ll load up.

No joke, as I’m typing this a friend (still living there) just messaged me and said “No worries. I’ll just order it on Coupang.” I will be investing once I free up some capital."
03/13/2021,stocks,I read about a new company daily that’s the new Amazon of <insert country>. Amazon is the only Amazon.

03/13/2021,stocks,"I am also not sure if they can compete with SE and Alibaba and just to stick in their 'small' home country of South Korea wont give them much growth.

03/13/2021,stocks,"Lol yep. I remember when every new social media site that popped up internationally was ""the Facebook of"" ... fill in the country. 

Market saturation is def a concern. Sounds like they currently have about 25% of SK's e-commerce"
03/13/2021,stocks,"Thnx. And I agree, look at how successful profit sharing was for Walmart in the early years"
03/13/2021,stocks,Yeah it didn't get much media coverage
03/13/2021,stocks,So? That’s not necessarily a bad thing. Debt is super cheap right now so you should be taking on debt and using it to grow. The real questions are: is their debt cheap and are the taking on debt for the right reasons. Debt fuels growth.
03/13/2021,stocks,"That and the fact that they aren't profitable are definitely concerns. But they have the backing of Softbank, so there's some deep pockets behind them."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Awsome, thnx for the info. Im looking to buy in when I can also"
03/13/2021,stocks,"I also lived in Sk for many years. While this may appear lucrative and it is efficient now, how do they expect to deal with what we already know. Once things open Koreans will be out in force shopping. And haggling as does most of East and SE Asia. I feel the reason e commerce hasn't taken of there as it has it the west is because like so many things in Asia, shopping is a communal event on so many levels. I believe it has room to run but to dub it amazon at this point may be a fools errand."
03/13/2021,stocks,"It's likely that in the medium term we'll have a few regional players somewhat similar to Amazon (MELI, BABA, JUMIA and SEA are the most obvious contenders, while Europe is still up for grabs) but I don't see Coupang as having the potential to become one of them. They'll be successful in SK but I doubt that they have much potential to capture serious market share outside of SK in the region.

Japan has a mature market that is very hard to penetrate by SK companies and right next door there's Alibaba which very hard to beat. And in SE Asia they have to deal with Sea Ltd., which already proved that it can beat BABA. In Russia they'd also face stiff competition (assuming that they even plan to go there). Moreover, Russia has a culture that's very different from that of SK and SK isn't known for being able to create multicultural companies. You can't expand internationally as an e-commerce company unless you can understand and negotiate the different cultures of the areas where you plan to expand."
03/13/2021,stocks,"They'll face stiff competition in SE Asia from Sea Ltd. That region has a rather different culture from that of SK, a country which isn't much liked over there except as a source of tourism and investing. Most people in the region will go with Sea because it's based in Singapore and viewed as a native company of the region, who understands its culture and concerns. Singapore mixes the three major ethnic and cultural components of the area so it is excellently placed to support the kind of multicultural company that can be successful in SE Asia.

They might do better in Japan but keep in mind that most people there prefer Japanese companies (economic nationalism) and SK has a complex relationship with Japan, which has been on the lower side in recent times.

I don't see much potential for them to copy Amazon's success in cloud services (which is the driver of Amazon's profits), largely because SK has been lagging in software services forever. It doesn't have the same kind of tech ecosystem that exists in the US or even in China. SK is stronger in hardware than software. Even Samsung never produced any software of value (for example, their cell-phones use Android with some bloatware added in).

They could expand more easily into China but they are unlikely to capture any serious market share there because they'll face huge competition from Alibaba and the like."
03/13/2021,stocks,"And it’s a pipe dream atm they don’t even dominate Korea in those sectors yet. No one uses Coupang eat, no one has switched from Netflix or YouTube"
03/13/2021,stocks,They'll try and they'll fail. Asian countries prefer homegrown companies due to nationalism.
03/13/2021,stocks,I read the dd of a Korean/American on reddit and apparently they have 5%
03/13/2021,stocks,Yeah I hadn't seen it in mainstream media today that's for sure.
03/13/2021,stocks,"Agree with this. It’s one of the reasons I’m bullish on JMIA. It’s definitely one of my risky plays, with Africa being Africa; but it’s got the potential to grow exponentially given the barriers to entry.

Out of interest, how do you see Flipkart and the Indian market fitting into the race for eCommerce dominance in Asia? Do you think we’ll see Flipkart holding India as BABA with China, with SEA holding the largest market share outside of this; or is South Asia a target for BABA, SEA and further AMZN expansion?"
03/13/2021,stocks,It was on Bloomberg.
03/13/2021,stocks,"I agree on JMIA. I think that the Indian e-commerce market is one to watch but I haven't researched it in detail so I cannot say something truly cogent about Flipkart.

SEA could have success in India. With BABA it's a bit complex there, again because of political tensions. South Asia doesn't like China very much (and also doesn't really like SK) so India is most likely to go with a combination of homegrown companies and SEA. Large parts of SE Asia have a long history of contacts with India (because of the Srivijaya empire and others) and cultural influence from there so they can understand each other pretty well; in fact Indians are generally viewed quite positively in SE Asia and the feeling is mutual. They also have many economic and political interests in common.

In general when looking at Asia one cannot ignore the political tensions of the region, especially in culturally sensitive sectors such as e-commerce. It's quite different in that regard from North America, Europe or (most of) South America."
2021-03-13 09:29:10,stocks,"What do I do with my SQ? I'm in on SQ with 5% of my portfolio with a cost basis of 185.  I only have 12 shares and like the stock.  

If it fell 50% I'd most likely buy more and wouldn't even worry.

I'm up 30% since buying my first 4 shares back in 6/2020.

So should I hold?  

Any other SQ fans?

 
I also have PYPL.

But I keep hearing on CNBC that in gonna get burned holding these type of ""high fliers"" as the tech sell off continues."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Hold. If this dip didnt show you have easily they rally then idk what will. 

Sq and pypl each hold 5% in my portfolio. Im very long on them for many reasons. As time goes on digital wallets will be huge as no one really uses physical cash now. Plus throw in cyrpto and you have a whole big money maker. I truly think over the next few years this will be huge. 

I will not be selling mine. Holding through ups and downs"
03/13/2021,stocks,I don’t hold square stock but I use sq for invoicing and love it. I actually switched most of my invoicing from pp to sq at the beginning of last year for multiple reasons. Still love pp (and hold 3 whole shares! 😂) but as a sq customer I am quite happy. (They could benefit from an internal shipping label system like PayPal has though.)
03/13/2021,stocks,"Both SQ and PYPL are the future, don't pay too much attention to CNBC shills, they are cheerleading whatever their bosses ask them to. 

Do your own homework, ask yourself why you bought SQ to begin with and what has changed since, regarding the SQ future.

I also have both since last year and I'm always buying more when there is an opportunity.

Online and mobile payments are the future, credit cards and checks are the past."
03/13/2021,stocks,"I say add to your position on the dip. I hope you don’t think of SQ mainly as a provider of POS and payment processing solutions. They provide so much more such as tools to develop and manage your own e-commerce store like SHOP, banking/financial services, investing service (incl. crypto investments), etc. TheIr services are all integrated creating good cross-selling opportunities. It’s definitely not “massively overvalued” let alone overvalued if you are forward looking."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Love SQ.  Held since 2018 and it’s grown to 17% of my portfolio.  Never trimmed, bought more last Year in March during the dip, now at a $73 cost basis.

Keep holding, buy the dips, watch the big banks run away from the threat (Chase pay was just deprecated)."
03/13/2021,stocks,"If you sell SQ now you will regret it. Look at Bitcoin, it’s mooning. Who just invested in Bitcoin? SQ. SQ makes up 29% of my portfolio and I will never, ever sell a share. My cost average is 150."
03/13/2021,stocks,What are you worried about buy more and buy your averages down when you can.
03/13/2021,stocks,"SQ was and is pretty high valued. So it got a big hit, but last two weeks also some recovery. I had issues with PACB and ShOP as well. I have decided to hold on because I am convinced by the future of SQ and PACB. SHOP might loose speed due to ending pandemic situation. SQ looks good"
03/13/2021,stocks,I like square and think it's a good investment. I had a late position then the market did that thing so I lost all my gains .I plan on getting a few shares in the near future
03/13/2021,stocks,"Love SQ. Been accumulating since 115. Bought more as it fell from the 230s down to 195. 

Not selling a share."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Yes I do . Remember stocks don't don't care who you are. Don't be afraid to take gains when you can .when a stock dips say 15to 20% I've bought my averages down on stocks, let them go back up and taken my initial investment back. Once you have done that , that stock becomes pure profit ."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Well, I bought at 11.. still holding :)"
03/13/2021,stocks,"I'm cautiously holding long term but not expecting a great deal over the next 12 months. Insiders have only been selling in the last 12 monrhs, no buys and around 400m of ""unusual items"" skewed the last years profits. Massively overvalued so due for a slide in my opinion but will be back!"
03/13/2021,stocks,I would be careful with Square.  PayPal seems like a much better choice.
03/13/2021,stocks,Thanks bud!
03/13/2021,stocks,Thanks.  I only have $2700 in SQ.  not risking a lot.
03/13/2021,stocks,"Awesome I'm in at 185 lol!  I can only get in that low with a 50% crash right?

Not that I HAVE to be at that cost basis.  Does cost basis matter anyways?

I always just look at it as a moat or margin before eating into my principle."
03/13/2021,stocks,Wow you must be shaking in your 👢!! 29%?!  😆.  So I guess with 5% I don't have much to worry about.  But you'll probably end up richer!
03/13/2021,stocks,Do you think SQ and PYPL Will be here in 10 years?  Serious question.
03/13/2021,stocks,Yeah you can always just keep it to 1% of portfolio.  Not much risk if you're unsure.  It's 5% of mine.
03/13/2021,stocks,What's your cost basis?  Mines 185 but I only have 12 shares.
03/13/2021,stocks,"The problem with that is if you sell when a stock goes up and then think I'll get back in when it goes lower - you're trying to time the market.  It doesn't work.  The stock can just go sideways or keep going up.  

It's better to just buy high and low period."
03/13/2021,stocks,Wow you're rich!!! ..... 1000 shares?!!
03/13/2021,stocks,"By the way.  Does overvalued mean too many people own shares or is that overbought?  Are they the same thing?

Or does overvalued just mean the share price is not worth the actual companys performance?"
03/13/2021,stocks,Yeah I'm not big in on it.  It's 5% right now.  PYPL is 5% too.  I feel SQ is gonna be good but there may be some volatility.  That's time to buy more shares little by little.
03/13/2021,stocks,It always matters.  Helps you control the amount of cash you put in and when to put it in.
03/13/2021,stocks,I'm not sure if you saw my last reply.  It's in comments referring to your  question.  1 of the stocks I've been doing this with and only because I believe in the company is LIZI .
03/13/2021,stocks,"About the same. I have shares in a few accounts, but I think they average out at about 185ish. I started accumulating from 115 in the summer, and continued to consistently add a little bit to about 250, and then bought more again from the 230s to 195 when it fell last week. So made purchases on both sides of 185."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Yeah, I wish it was 1000 :D"
03/13/2021,stocks,"Overvalued is the price is too high in relation to the company's earnings. Although that's only part of the picture and that can just remain a touchstone of caution if there is other information, such as a new product or merger coming up."
03/13/2021,stocks,Ok. But today's highs may be tommorow lows.
03/13/2021,stocks,I could pay off my house!
03/13/2021,stocks,"Sure... then you buy appropriately to lower the cost basis, rather than doing nothing."
03/13/2021,stocks,What if it keeps going up though?
03/13/2021,stocks,"Haha, then you still buy, to keep your cost basis lower than if you bought later... but for me, I try to have established my position already and wouldn’t add more."
03/13/2021,stocks,Never?  Then you miss out on even more gains.
03/13/2021,stocks,"Mostly not, I mainly buy my existing stocks when things drop."
03/13/2021,stocks,But don't you have SQ?  Wouldn't it exist?
03/13/2021,stocks,Not sure what you mean.
03/13/2021,stocks,Why wouldn't you buy more SQ on dips I mean?
03/13/2021,stocks,"I wouldn’t buy if there were no dips... I may buy on a significant dip, but I’m already pretty happy with my position and cost basis to do nothing."
03/13/2021,stocks,"What's your basis again?  I'm at 185 with only 12 shares.  

So with my basis of 185 and say sq were to drop to 175.  How many shares would it take to drop my basis below 185?"
2021-03-13 07:29:49,stocks,"Locked away stocks What are some stocks that you are holding for the long terms. Stocks that you don't planning on selling or looking at for the next fifteen-twenty years as you feel they might be next amazon, tesla, google."

I'm holding V X R T and BLUE long. Just rotated most of my portfolio to Tilray but was too emotionally tied to those two to liquidate.

I like V X R T because its pill form COVID vaccine has the potential to be a stable booster for next year if they show it generates antibodies in its phase 2 trial.

And I like Bluebird because I think gene therapy is the future of medicine. I bought it on it's crash last month and it's worked out well so far."

And i predict it dominates streaming before long. Dont bet against the mouse"
03/13/2021,stocks,Boring for now… MSFT is about to take off. XBOX is such an underrated business for MSFT. XBOX generates more revenue in a quarter than Activision in a year. Now with the Bethesda acquisition I think XBOX side of the business will get more attention. AAPL and MSFT are my top 2 holdings and I’ll HODL forever.

03/13/2021,stocks,Leaps on it?
03/13/2021,stocks,"Eh. Idk man. Yeah the interest rates will go up. But housing is in short supply. As in actual houses. 
Pain in the ass and a dash of luck to find a non apartment place to live in my city for instance. House prices arent going to drop dramatically anytime soon imo. When interest rates go up id expect house prices to go down about double the percentage interest went up in current short supply climate. Nothing to sneeze at but recovered in short time."
03/13/2021,stocks,It's a secret
03/13/2021,stocks,Honestly i think thats a great idea. I have those too
03/13/2021,stocks,I added some during the dip 🔥🔥. Gonna hold minim 5 years
03/13/2021,stocks,"My problem is the fact that wages haven't increased yet houses are increasing at such a fast rate, its just so counter intuitive, I always say this but japan went through a similar low rate bubble and a small increase in rates by the boj popped the bubble fast, we are nowhere near japan levels and if you think it might get there enjoy the ride but in my opinion this is a trade you need to know when to get out on."
03/13/2021,stocks,Ah. Well. I hate to say it but. Wages not increasing to match housing is just a big push into apartments as the wealth gap grows imo. I don't like it but i dont see it changing. Supply on houses will remain limited. Especially as older homes get too old and demolished and onlyn200k+ homes are being built
03/13/2021,stocks,"The reason it will inevitably have to change and again I love my japan comparisons, but if prices increase so much as do that young people and imagrants can't buy homes like what happend in Japan the economy will suffer because of it and the fed will be forced to pop the bubble, there is lots of money to be made before that but getting out in time is crucial"
03/13/2021,stocks,"Gotcha. Well in that case, i would say there's probably a certain % housing increases have to stay within inflation  to not be a bubble that needs popped. Ill have to check out housing prices vs inflation past decade or two. 
I just. Idk. Maybe my investing strategy is fucked but with united states stocks i always invest assuming the little guys get fucked. I cant picture our elite hurting their property values for instance. Or like gme i sold at 290 cuz i dont picture them letting it get much higher than that, even if it takes corruption. Or like if someone ever made an AI program that detects political corruption id short the fuck outta it.
 Wage wise i think a 15 min wage everywhere is soon to comem youll have to do diff math very soon imo"
03/13/2021,stocks,"Don't listen to the inflation narrative, there isn't inflation because of expansion in the money supply, the inflation that we see in comodites and stock prices and housing is cause by low rates and not overprinting. The elites really can't do much to prevent the fed from bursting the bubble, there is a myth that powerful people control the market and that is just not true, billions were lost in Japan and in 2000, and 08 and many other instances if people really can prevent the market from crashing they would have used it, the fed right now has one choice they absolutely don't like stock or housing prices but they don't have a choice they need low rates to get out of covid, but once we are out they most likely will try and get ride of the bubble as fast as possible or we will end up like Japan. Honestly as a young person and little guy I want this bubble gone, I want to be able to afford a house without taking on monstrous debt."
03/13/2021,stocks,"I agree with your take on the housing market. It is an issue in various EU countries as well and Canada for example  is at the brink of going really bad. In my country (Netherlands) and in Canada the government has been implementing policy for over a decade  to stimulate people to buy/own their own house. These policies are interefering with how the market would naturally evolve and develop resulting in crazy housing prices and insane increases year after year. And this effects also disturbs the renting market for houses as well.

My friend bought a house 2 years ago for around 265K euro, this year his house is worth close to 450K euro (this is not an exception but more like the rule atm). Imagine buying a house today for this amount and the price drops to the price of last year. You are paying interest on an object that is not remotely worth what you payed for. If you want or need  to move and sell your house you will have to take huge loses as well. Most people will wait with selling until prices go up again so they either can take their loss or have to wait a long time for the prices to reach the same levels as before (if that will even happen and prices wont continue to drop). Housing market will get stuck, banks will have huge problems if people are defaulting on their morgage because the worth of the object won't cover the initial loan. etc etc. I don't want to sound gloomy but we have seen this before in 2008 and I think your concern is warranted."
2021-03-13 07:14:09,stocks,"Any thoughts on Macy's? Wondering if anyone has any thoughts on Macy's as a 2-3 year investment? They've been on a tear since Nov 2020. They took on some debt in 2019 and 2020 to restructure with their Polaris strategy amidst getting destroyed by COVID, but they're cutting costs and closing unprofitable locations while focusing on high-volume locations, digital, and smaller non-mall locations. They've also put significant work into their off-price branding. They used to have sky high short interest as high as 42% in July which is down to less than 14% now (I wonder if this covering is in part driving the shares up). Institutional ownership is growing and insiders are also buying rather than selling for the first time in years. Last 3 quarters they beat EPS and turned a profit in the last quarter. As for downsides, I really don't see a huge moat and their competition is stiff in the consumer discretionary sector. I am super curious because I looked them up yesterday and decided to track their ticker just to see how they do, and lo-and-behold they went up 10% today. Haven't seen them mentioned at all on any of the subs so I'm curious if anyone has checked it out."

They're new business model is ""if its not 60% off or more, you are getting screwed!"" I have very little faith in them continuing to be a company in 2-5 years."
03/13/2021,stocks,"I think people underestimate Macy’s. This is an American institution. You can’t have Thanksgiving without the Macy’s parade. But beyond nostalgia, it’s taking the right strategy by shrinking its footprint to its strongest performing stores, while increasing online sales. Bloomingdales and Macy’s aren’t going under like a Sears, they’ve still got a strong brand and reputation, and could benefit from a post pandemic wedding and shopping boom."
03/13/2021,stocks,"They are soon to be obsolete, just like Sears.  I’d give em 3 more years before they go fully bust."
03/13/2021,stocks,It is amazing how quickly they went from a legit store to total garbage. I would rather shop at Target.  It is just sad. The one downtown Chicago used to be so nice. Now it is scary and just gross.
03/13/2021,stocks,"I shop at Macy’s online for a lot of my clothes. We live in the countryside so there isn’t much decent shopping to choose from.  I won’t buy clothes from WalMart and Kohl’s is often disappointing.  Macy’s online selection is much better than what they have in store.  I bought Macy’s stock last spring during quarantine and sold it when it raised a bunch.   I wouldn’t buy the stock now, too high.  

Like many brick and mortar retailers the future is unknown. However, I’ve been happy with their selection online and have had good experiences with their overall service.  

IMO, shopping on Amazon for clothes feels like I’m at a flea market.  When you see something cute, it’s hard to know if the item will be decent or just some crap made in China. I’d rather shop online with a retailer I trust, and Amazon is too much of the Wild West with all kinds of sellers that have come out of the woodwork to make a buck."
03/13/2021,stocks,It’s still a better place to buy clothes than Walmart or Target or rolling the dice on Amazon. Not bullish on the stock but I don’t really get why people don’t like buying clothes there.

03/13/2021,stocks,"I don’t know if that’s going to do them any good.  Amazon and other online retailers are closing the traditional mall shopping experience.  Less and less people shop at actual stores, they should do some online thing or major advertisement."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Yes!  Sad because I remember Marshall Fields and it was so iconic. But that’s ok. Things change. Crate and Barrel is huge Starbucks now on Michigan Ave :). But they already have state street target a bit south... so I am assuming it will close?  

I am so bearish on any brick and mortar store. Maybe because I hate shopping :). I guess Costco is somehow doing well though... so who knows."
03/13/2021,stocks,"I used their app quite a bit during Covid for clothes and kitchen items, and their selection and service were really great, better than Amazon and Costco for instance.  Service was excellent.  

I wonder if they couldn't just close down all the poor performing locations over the coming years as leases expire, while keeping the Macy's Homestore concept going, there by going mostly digital.  

They have the product selection to be a player if they have the leadership to spearhead a vision."

If you would have put $1400 into apple back then it’d be worth about $6500. Tesla? About $20K. 

Moral of the story - stick that check into a name brand and don’t look at it. Something you use. Twitter perhaps. Facebook works. If you want to swing for the fences maybe Square. Don’t fuck around with options or penny stocks. The stock market game is not hard long term - the line goes up and to the right so long as  you put your money in good companies."

I have:

1 microsoft

1 walt disney

2 exxon mobil

2 united airlines

1 enphase energy

1 nextera

Now I am about -1.5% loss, but I'm sure I will be in profit after a while.

Biggest disappointment is tsmc - it dropped to about -10% for me.

On the other hand, exxon mobil did +10%.

Apple and microsoft are stable as hell.

But I am not some pro trader or investor, I just bought some stocks because my simple thoughts like: oil and airlines will eventually grow back after vaccines, alt energy is popular, and some companies are just set in stone.

With such amount of money and willing to diverse I am not a fun of idea buying 2 teslas."

03/13/2021,stocks,I mean same could be said about Amazon. Pick a stock you think has any long-term viability or something you use nearly every day. ($1400 in AMZN 5 years ago is $7834 today).
03/13/2021,stocks,That’s the complete opposite of what I said.
03/13/2021,stocks,"Haha, it’s actually quite the opposite. Look at Warren Buffet’s portfolio over the years. It’s just a collection of classic American companies. 

The problem comes from over-complicating things, which people will do forever. Chasing EV stocks, ARK funds, paying 50x sales for unprofitable companies, thinking you found the next big thing.

If you just buy a portfolio of maybe 20 blue-chip stocks, you will most likely do pretty well.

AAPL, AMZN, NVDA, JPM, AXP, HLT, TSM, TGT, BLK, DIS, SBUX, ETSY, COST, PYPL, V, NKE, CRM, VZ, GS, ABBV

I just came up with this list of the top of my head. But seriously if you just keep it simple with something like this you will do well. The problem is no one wants to keep it simple and they always want to bet on something that can go up 10x in the next year.

EDIT: One thing I want to add. I’m not saying that this portfolio of 20 stocks will beat the market over the long run. I definitely think it could, but it very well may not. Warren Buffet had a great quote about investing and he said that you don’t need a lot of IQ to be a great investor. What you need is temperament. Can you hold through a 2+ year bear market? Can you resist the urge to jump into the next hot stock? Can you be patient and buy stocks only when they’re at the right price? You don’t need to predict where the stock will move tomorrow or next week or even next year. You don’t need to predict macrotrends. You don’t need to predict investor sentiment. You just need to buy good companies at fair prices, and hold through the good, bad, and the ugly."

03/13/2021,stocks,Thanks its not just about stocks. Many mental problems and a gambling addiction not to stocks but to sports betting and it started with poker. Recent losses hurts but its more then that. I visit r/suicidewatch probably better place to rant then here and I do rant there sometimes. Time is the only thing that heals losses for me. Its my fault. Im really a nobody other then the pain I feel.
03/13/2021,stocks,Too lazy and mental problems to ever got it. Oh well I'm only one little person outa billions. I'm thankful for the shit I have that other people don't but doesn't change my fucked up mind.

03/13/2021,stocks,"Yes I think so, it's my impression that despite the political risks, a company growing at this rate with a forward P/E ratio of ~20 should be priced much higher. It has the largest cloud business (now profitable) in the largest consumer market in the world, on-top of falling 50% off it's previous highs. 

I'm not convinced the government will seriously cripple the largest of the country's jewels in the growing cloud and AI sector, a key strategic area for the future. Even a $1B fine would be insignificant for the company."

Of course, it might go back to $40 a share anyway - but I'm not buying. Its overvalued and unethical (big data). There are countless places to put your money, theres no need to put it in PLTR."

03/13/2021,stocks,"Yea, so like someone making 30k a year at age 50 is likely to use the 1400 to survive. But someone young making 65k and living at home is going to invest it. 

But it goes to the purpose of the 1400 it is not the component of the bill to help people survive. It is the component designed to increase spend in the economy. Does it also help a ton of people sure. But that was not the goal. There are other areas in the bill, like the unemployment top up, that are for that. 

Basically saying the 1400 was to help people survive is not true."

03/13/2021,stocks,It’s easy to say when you have the money. You need money to make money. People that can spare a couple thousand can buy one or two shares of the big name companies. Thus they can’t really make money. That’s why they go for the lower priced stocks because there’s actually a shot to make money.

I started reading Stoic philosophy by picking up a book out of curiosity called ['Happy: Why More or Less Everything is Absolutely Fine'](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30142270-happy). It's a great intro to Stoicism but there are plenty of others, after reading it and looking into it a bit more I found many (successful) people observe the philosophy. 

I wanna be clear; none of them ask for money, a lot of stoic philosophers have been dead for centuries, discipline is needed in abundance, it isn't an easy path, there are no really weird practices, for me it just kind of made sense the more I read it. I think everyone should try it, it isn't harmful and you might benefit."

03/13/2021,stocks,Yeah I am not going to lie I don’t know too much about IBM. However I am invested in INTC. I bought into them back when they were trading at $48.00 a share. Would love to see them dip into the low fifties so I can add more.

03/13/2021,stocks,"Yes, because it’s an extremely aggressive growth ETF in a bull market where growth massively overperformed.

Depends on your strategy for this type of particular stock.

It's in most supermarkets (not just Whole Foods), fast food places carry it (Dunkin Donuts, Carl's Junior), and randomly almost all National Parks have a Beyond Burger on the menu in any lodge, hotel, or restaurant. Up until the pandemic hit, I was traveling for work about 40% of the time. A lot of this time was spent in Florida and Alabama which are places that being vegan is extremely hard. Whenever I did find a place that had something on the menu that I could eat, it was almost always a Beyond Burger.

A little bit about the popularity of mean alternatives: I got to meet the founder of Tofurky about two years ago. He said that alternative meat is the fastest growing segment in supermarkets. They saw a 40% increase YOY where other segments see 1-2% increase. That kind of growth is unheard of for anything in a supermarket."

You keep referring to “oh add thousands here and there through the years” BUT you are ignoring the fact that this is not feasible for a lot of people. That’s why I said your advice is okay for people with a lot of disposable income. Just stop trying to push your agenda that is completely off base with people that don’t have thousands of disposable income each year to continually invest."
03/13/2021,stocks,Okay? How often does a stock go up $3000
03/13/2021,stocks,I’m not a vegan but actually prefer the Dunkin’ Donuts Beyond Sausage to the regular one. I highly recommend it.
03/13/2021,stocks,Check out Tattooed Chef (TTCF). Recently secured a deal with Target. 25 shares @ 17.70 with a pt around 39.
03/13/2021,stocks,You don’t understand how this game works. The reasoning you’re using is exactly how people get wrecked in the market.
03/13/2021,stocks,"You're assuming this $1400 is your only investment. Sure, if you have to somehow fund your retirement with a $1400 investment now you might as well swing for the fences. But I don't think anyone here needs to do that. You can turn every $1400 you invest, including this stimulus, into close to $5k in 10 years by averaging a 10 increase per year."

03/13/2021,stocks,"That’s not a competitor.

I think you’re confusing a company attempting to recreate meat via plants with a company that just sells non meat products. If this is the case then anyone selling fruits and vegetables is a competitor (ex: Chiquita is not a competitor). 

Impossible Foods is the next runner up in plant based meat products, but they are still private."
03/13/2021,stocks,"I looked into them, 1B value with one actual plant, there is no true barrier to there product as it is just, we source good plants, and are chef has tattoos. There sales info was also kind of scary. Something like 4 units sold per week per walmart location. 

They could turn out to be something or they could turn out to just be another of a long long list of pre made froze food companies. Don't think it is right to compare to BYND who has a actual barrier to there market as no one else has been able to produce a meat sub as close to meat as they have. Now BYND could also get completely blown up if we see a major leap in lap grown meat."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Ya, check em out, I'm long,  so I'll be buying dips (after  GME)"
03/13/2021,stocks,"Isn't that a bit like saying Apple isn't a competitor of other providers of phones/laptops/tablets etc? Sure, some people specifically want the Apple operating system, and some don't, but ultimately they will all choose a phone/laptop/tablet.

Similarly some people want a meat substitute and some just want meatless food, but ultimately if you're looking for pre-prepared plant based food you'll be choosing between them where they're both available."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Ok, I'll go back and check the two, however,  they are close enough for me to be a similar competitor,  since both are producing similar products."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Ya, I only purchased shares after I saw the alert with the Target partnership.  Their product line being sold there gives them a bit more exposure,  so I'm cool with holding for the year and seeing how it goes."
03/13/2021,stocks,"I think that’s where the confusion of value is. Beyond meat isn’t just the “end” products they make. The biggest bet they are making is trying to become an ingredient for major food chains. They aren’t looking to make a whole whopper, they are trying to provide the plant based meat ingredient that burger king can use to construct the patty. They are closer to Lopez Foods provided McDonald’s beef then they are McDonald’s. 

From a cell phone comparison, they would be more like android OS. An “ingredient” that can be used by multiple manufacturers, example Samsung. But with that, they can also attempt the Google cell phone. The key is being an ingredient, not just an end focused product. 

We can argue this for days and analogies will never perfectly fit, but if you choose to compare it to Apple os with it being specifically tied to their end product, you are missing the applications they are working on in the overall food market."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Friend, I assure you they are not. That like calling Tesla a competitor to Panasonic because they both have products that run on electricity."
03/13/2021,stocks,"That's a good point, and I'm not arguing, I'm discussing. Even if Tatooed Chef becomes a big brand in vegetarian meals, unless they produce their own ingredient they won't be challenging for any of those big chain restaurant meals, which restricts their growth.

However, I think both will be successful as long as the demand for plant based food increases and as long as they continue to produce good products. I think we'll see more moves by Tatooed Chef into other higher end grocery stores, which will attract more of their target market than Walmart."

2021-03-13 06:46:12,stocks,"S&P 500 E-Mini Futures Chat Group Hi All,

I have been learning and creating a strategy to trade S&P 500 E-Mini futures. I have a small WhatsApp group where we post and talk about our trades. We also discuss strategy or anything else that helps us improve. I feel that retail traders should help each other. Ultimately, it's us against the institutions. :)

A few things about myself:  
1. I am not a newbie or a professional trader. I am somewhere in the middle. Over 10 years ago, I spent 2 years as a full time day trader before getting back into the technology business.  
2. I am a price action purist meaning that I believe all of the information you need to know to make good trades are in the changing prices. You really don't need any other indicators.  
3. I am a conservative and methodical person. I understand that the longer you stay in the ""game"", the better chances you have for success. I am a big believer that it is a priority to protect your account.  
4. I am looking at different types of strategies from scalping to swing to a hybrid of both.

Let me know if you are interested in joining. Thanks."

Contradictory opinions are vital in researching a stock. I always seek these reasons not to buy a company before making an investment. It’s no different then when purchasing something off Amazon, check the 1- and 3-star reviews to see why people didn’t like the item.

03/13/2021,stocks,"If you're doing DD, wouldn't you want to read fool's opinions? Even if you don't agree with it, or believe you see something they don't, it's still going to be a widely accepted position on the stock that may impact how/when lots of other investors act regarding the stock."
03/13/2021,stocks,I do the opposite of the fool and make money every time. They say sell I buy. They say buy I stay away or sell if I have any.

03/13/2021,stocks,Fucked up when a fool article is on yahoo finance and it isn't listed as a promotion. At the end of the short article it says click here to see an all in must buy stock. They spat off 100 stocks a month and keep bringing up the one that hit like they can't miss.

03/13/2021,stocks,"Motley Fools went from being “anti-establishment” rule breakers with nuggets of good ideas freely offered in the 1990s to being establishment themselves 20 years later. Their entire business model now is posting click bait articles to snag subscribers for their various useless newsletters.

03/13/2021,stocks,"I would honestly recommend to do -motley instead, because there is a small, but relevant chance, that this could disable an article because they said something like, “you’re a fool if you don’t sell covered calls!” Or whatever.

OP’s idea will also eliminate articles that reference a Motley Fool article, even if it’s to say “Motley Fool is wrong about ticker _______”.  So overall I agree, good idea if you don’t want to see their stuff, but there may be a few side effects."

03/13/2021,stocks,"I’m just curious as to why Motley Fool is bad? I’m relatively new to investing and have read motley fool sometimes when researching stocks. 

Is it just that it’s too basic/ for beginners and so not useful for more advanced people or professionals? Or is the content biased/ poorly researched/ simply incorrect?"
03/13/2021,stocks,But how will I know about the top 4 picks of stocks that are different than the thing I'm researching?
03/13/2021,stocks,"Investment news are shit. News are supposed to uncover facts, not creating them.

Any suggestions you get about investments are meant to help someone else. It's too obvious at this point."

03/13/2021,stocks,"Nice. Yep, their free articles are pure clickbait garbage that contradict each other and are probably written by interns. That said, their paid articles are actually pretty good and are a great starting point for research and DD because they led me to winners I wouldn't have thought about otherwise. I think their free clickbait articles and ads are created by unpaid interns, and their paid services are written by people with decent experience on trends."

I fucking hate the way they write theyre articles, but theyre legit."
03/13/2021,stocks,"I used to freelance for them, and work in-house for a competitor who did a similar thing. They’re publishers - that’s their business model. Ultimately, anyone who gets good at investing doesn’t bother subscribing to their shit."

03/13/2021,stocks,A stock market QAnon movement in the making
03/13/2021,stocks,How do you use a heatmap as an investment strategy?
03/13/2021,stocks,Do you use Yahoo Finance by any chance? Whenever I check a stock I’m greeted with “Why this stock popped today”
03/13/2021,stocks,"Yeah they have a very scammy, clickbait feel to them. I forgot what possessed me to do so, but I decided to give their Stock Advisor a shot ($99/yr). For some reason it’s a complete 180 from what they put out there to the general public. The DD is good and not trying to sell you anything, and they have multiple analysts contributing to the same topics so you get a pretty good idea of what you’re looking at IMO. They also bombard my inbox with offers I’m never going to use with clickbait titles -_-

I would say if you already know what to look for in a stock they’re def not worth it. If you’re uneducated like me it’s helpful."
03/13/2021,stocks,I would consider his advice over the people of this sub. People are right it’s spammy but they have great tools both paid and free
03/13/2021,stocks,[deleted]
03/13/2021,stocks,"The paid service is completely different and well worth it on my opinion.  Good analytics and no contradictory opinions like the free articles.

The free articles are trash and I had a negative view about them for years until I read a comment that stated the exact same thing as I am typing now.

That being said, when you first become a customer they still spam hard with advertising.  I emailed them asking them to shut it all off start treating me like a paying customer and I haven't seen the advertisement emails since."
03/13/2021,stocks,If you're looking up terms and such just use Investopedia
03/13/2021,stocks,With a subscription it has quality content. Their free articles are the least informative thing in the entire world.
03/13/2021,stocks,They publish 100 articles a week about the same stock. 50 of them being bullish and 50 bearish. 99 of them with no supporting evidence besides author opinion. [Here's an example](https://www.reddit.com/r/CanadianInvestor/comments/m3tl1s/an_overview_of_motley_fools_opinion_on_air_canada/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)
03/13/2021,stocks,"People don't understand the difference between the paid services and the independent contributor model.  Sometimes it seems like they take both sides bjt it's different contributors, and at the bottom of the article they disclose what they own or recommend."
03/13/2021,stocks,"I recently got a year of their premium Stock Advisor service for $50 (normally $150) via an American Express promotion.

Thankfully it had a 30-day full refund policy. I had it for a week before canceling to get my money back.

They spammed the crap out of my inbox with poo. On day 2 of membership I received 10 different emails from them. Of those 10, EIGHT of them were marketing emails trying to get me to sign up for more premium services. Of the last 2, only one actually talked about a current new stock pick. The other one was just a stroke job telling me how good their 5-year positions were doing -- no shit.

It seriously was so much garbage and no actual content or substance.

My buddy says he listens to their podcast and finds it informative, but even he stays away from the articles."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Nothing... their paid stuff is not bad. i almost thought this was some meme/joke thread or something... from the 3 people I know that pay the $100/year for their picks, their portfolios have doubled since Sept 2020"
03/13/2021,stocks,"They write so much article they probably have bull and bear articles for every stock in the S&P 500. 

Here is their opinion of Air Canada. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/CanadianInvestor/comments/m3tl1s/an_overview_of_motley_fools_opinion_on_air_canada/"
03/13/2021,stocks,There exaggerated because they pump up everything they own that's why their portfolio is 550%plus .
03/13/2021,stocks,"Last year I bought my first stock based on a Motley Fool article: Planet 13. Got in at $2 and it’s between $6-7 now depending on the day. I realize I got pretty lucky there. But I like Motley Fool and other sites like it just to bring new possible buys to my attention. I’m not buying just because of their articles anymore. But an ok starting point.

That said, as I’m still relatively new, if anyone has some other sites they’d like to suggest, I’m all ears."
03/13/2021,stocks,"nothing , but they are spammy af"
03/13/2021,stocks,That‘s right. They have sector overviews which sometimes pop out a name which you haven‘t heard before. I‘m not looking actively for their articles though and certainly don‘t use them as investing advice.
03/13/2021,stocks,yeah definitely  most important takeaway from this post
03/13/2021,stocks,Exactly this. Any alternative?
03/13/2021,stocks,"they were youngish dweebs 20 years ago 

 now, with all their experience, they are old dweebs"
03/13/2021,stocks,"OP refer to the spammy articles, not related to the paid services

Rule Breaker and Stock Advisor are really for the investors to try out because they are meant for long term. Investors always keep an open mind on what they can use to maximize their profit with minimal costs, RB and SA is really the first places they should be, a small price to pay, and some experience to get.  The next step is to do ones’ diligence and find those hidden gems themselves."
03/13/2021,stocks,Me too man. My trading mentor has tripled the market over the long run using Motley Fool and doing his own DD from there. Granted he pays for their like $5k/year plan so it had better be good.
03/13/2021,stocks,"Yes the article on the main page have nothing to do with the subscription articles, I stay away from homepage and go to premium articles."
03/13/2021,stocks,I found PLTR thru their podcast
03/13/2021,stocks,agreed. and the fact that most people are like OP wtf man.
03/13/2021,stocks,I mean I'm a subscriber to their premium service and their picks/dd are solid af. That's 550% *above* s&p 500 return btw not just 550% return. You can see past performance of all their picks and they are averaging like 75% return over the last 3 years. Yeah their marketing/free articles are annoying but theres money to be made on that site.
03/13/2021,stocks,"If their non-premium stuff is as useful as garbage juice, why would anyone think giving them money would make it that much better?"
03/13/2021,stocks,Why tf would any sane person pay for their paid contents if their free ones are absolutely stupid it makes me wanna blow my brains out?
03/13/2021,stocks,"I tried out the “money back” trial for a few months. The problem is that even when you are a paid member, half the site is more clickbait ads just trying to get you to pay for more services. Wtf. Their picks for the 3 months were all good though."
03/13/2021,stocks,Could you please tell us which analysts do you think are the best?
03/13/2021,stocks,I agree. The hate is ridiculous. It’s a legitimately good service.
03/13/2021,stocks,agree
03/13/2021,stocks,"True, it is the place for absolute buy and hold, and wait for profit, no research needed, because they did already.  If people realized they are paying something that pay them back with no work done, it is worth a try."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Their stock advisor and Rule Breakers services are great, and have the numbers to back it up, it’s the free articles that are terrible.


You can find promos for both services to get them for free or some cheap price."
03/13/2021,stocks,seeking alpha user comments are my favorite dd
03/13/2021,stocks,"I’m liking Barron’s these days. I go back and forth on Fool. I’ve had good picks with them (APPN, SHOP, ATVI), but they never address their bad or dated picks (e.g. UnderArmour when it tanked)"
03/13/2021,stocks,"Bloomberg (who's paywall is very easy to avoid), the FT, Wall Street Journal (sometimes), Yahoo (occasionally), and Businesswire. Genuinely though a lot of the best stuff I get is from Reddit (or linked to from Reddit)"
03/13/2021,stocks,Kickstart my heart(attack)!
03/13/2021,stocks,"Their Stock Advisor service is great, and as a newbie I recommend them. If you use some sort of cashback service, typically you can get cashback on all or a portion of the annual cost. The two fools send out stock picks to buy regularly. I don't always buy everything, but will pick ones I like that I like that they recommend. They always do well.

People here are complaining about the articles written by other authors on their site. So one article bullish and another bearish on the same stock posted in the same day. But by different authors. It would be like if I said Reddit is garbage because I read a post bullish and another bearish on a stock. Well.. yeah no shit, there are many different posters on here with different opinions. This happens everywhere, MarketWatch Seeking Alpha, etc."
03/13/2021,stocks,"You shouldn’t, their principles of investing are highly effective and they are pretty much the only “investing advice outfit” that calls out the financial industry for making a mint out of the man in the street with their expensive fees, commissions and “omg it’s far too risky for a layperson, you need one of our highly qualified financial advisors (sales people) to help you get crappy returns while we skim your investments. 

This said they are marketing their tip service so they write about everything and you will often notice contradictory articles about the same company. You could also argue this is about balanced views. Bottom line is make your own decisions using the information available and nothing wrong with their articles and research over anyone else’s in my opinion."
03/13/2021,stocks,"It's click bait. 

The article never give the information it promises, it's just walls of semi-related texts and ads. You can't even know what stock the article is about. 

And then if you subscribe for 199$ you'll realize that most of the content is behind another, more expensive, pay wall."
03/13/2021,stocks,"They don't allow commentary on their articles, so there's no way to refute the junk when it's published.   


All you can do it avoid them alltogether.   


If you want a site other than Reddit, where you can read attempts to appraise a stock, with commentary (which is often more valuable than the article), then try the seeking alpha website."
03/13/2021,stocks,Some of the picks are not bad. I do agree there. I just don’t like the constant up selling they do. I also happen to like real estate and they tried to upsell for 5k on million acres and how to invest passively in huge deals stating “you do not need to be an accredited investor” and did some DD. They basically just redirect you to crowdstreet where all the syndications actually require you to be an accredited investor. Basic service is good everything else it a scam in my opinion
03/13/2021,stocks,Just about everyone with a stock experienced that.
03/13/2021,stocks,"Sort of true.  I noticed that, their 2000$/year ( don't know why yearly fees when they may be change one stock or so)  services fair better.  

Strategy is simple. They have a list like 5G or, Rising Start, 630x whatever ..  Have 10 stock in them for few months.  

Then they recommend those stocks in SA or RB which are 100$/year.   Lots of suckers buy this and hope and pray.  certainly wait for ever.  Remember, there is no exit..  

Now, they claim in the 2000$/year services that, their picks went up 15%."
03/13/2021,stocks,that's correct
03/13/2021,stocks,What 6 months? Any stock you bought 6 months ago is likely in the green now cos of the crash...
03/13/2021,stocks,"Strongly disagree with your Teledoc thesis. They are the largest, international telehealth service provider and are accumulating loads of data. The Livongo  merger only added synergy to the mission. Genuinely want to know what substitute you've found that competes with Teledoc both in terms of ability to scale and monetize their AI and data. Even if covid never happened we were headed towards telehealth due to cost and convenience.

I've done DD on lemonade and I'm not an investor or a fan of the MF way of spamming you so we agree there."
03/13/2021,stocks,Their free articles are bad apparently because its just opinions. But the paid premium ones have good picks mostly.
03/13/2021,stocks,Absolutely
03/13/2021,stocks,"I think that they still do what you said, but they do have a clickbait type advertisement which is annoying. Paying for stock advisor actually gives great information though and is typically on sale for only $50. If someone is trading in the stock market, $50 should be nothing for additional DD."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Really? What were those stocks? 

I can write all those same articles.  ""Hey, if you put $5 in Microsoft in 1975 you'd have a billion dollars today.""  Almost all of these ""advice gurus"" just tell you to put money in the too big to fail like google, apple and amazon then you do, you make a little money then they say ""see, we're brilliant, send us more subscription money"" and you do.

So here's the ""$10,000 scam"" they run. They always give you like 5 stocks;  3 or 4 are behemoths like Amazon that can't lose, 1 or 2 are questionable companies nobody's heard of that might be on to something, might not be.  1 is let's say, Chesapeake Energy that goes bankrupt and is total loss.  But the others like Amazon, Google, Tesla and Netflix.  The 3,000 percent gain of Netflix alone eases the total loss of another. So they say ""see, you made money.""  

This is how financial advisors work, too, because they can get sued, lose their license and even face criminal charges for ""bad advice"" so they only put you in GM, Ford, Amazon and Exxon. Those are good companies but you aren't getting the 20,000 percent gains at Ford.

But everyone always thinks they're getting special info because of that one ""new"" stock they tell you about."
03/13/2021,stocks,Personally they helped me lose a ton of money so that's why few take their advice.
03/13/2021,stocks,Fool.com is the domain.

03/13/2021,stocks,Beware of the taxes.
03/13/2021,stocks,"NKLA has never been a recommended Stock Advisor pick. 

There is a vast difference between the bot-written feed on Yahoo, and their paid service. I’ve personally made back my money and then some with their Stock Advisor picks. It’s a good service that does a great deal of professional DD outside of usual tech-driven meme picks on Reddit."
03/13/2021,stocks,A time machine
03/13/2021,stocks,What a useless sub.
03/13/2021,stocks,"But the short of it is AAPL. Also from Motley: DO NOT invest in AAPL, there are better option. Also AAPL is the best investment for their sector. But here are 3 investments better then AAPL in their sector.

03/13/2021,stocks,I actually tried to sign up for motley fool just to see what 10 stocks they picked. But their website was broken and wouldn't let me sign up. Lol
03/13/2021,stocks,"I called them because they kept spamming me with buy this and learn the next big thing after paying the 100$ a year. They said it would be a sweet deal and cut the price to $1600. I asked what I got , thinking it would be a few stocks and show me which ones to invest in. They said it was just information where to invest my next 50k and if I didn’t have that much to invest for the next 5 years it wouldn’t be worth it anyways. That’s when I knew they were right. I have 6 months left with them but just want them to piss off."

03/13/2021,stocks,"And why in the world do these advertisements do this? They can take up to 30 minutes or so and they don't ever even get to a point. I guess I just answer my own question, I'm sure there's advertising at the top or bottom or end. I just never paid attention to it."

Also motley fool: We recommended these 3 stocks last year, if you had put $2k into them, you would have $30k!

Wow, no shit! Their name is also incredibly annoying. Why would you, whilst trying to market yourself as good stock pickers, call yourself 'motley fool'? Fuck off."
03/13/2021,stocks,"6 months? Try a couple hours lol. Or if you actually perfectly timed it, you could just tell a program to buy and sell at certain times and you could 1000x your money in a couple minutes probably"

03/13/2021,stocks,To me it gives off buzz feed vibes where they report anything and everything as news. Even if it’s actually nothing. They have on multiple occasions wrote stories about Reddit posts.

The way they've been covering the whole GME situation has led me to believe they're paid by hedge funds, just like Motley, Street, Benzinga and a few others."
03/13/2021,stocks,MarketWatch is owned by Dow Jones. Which is owned by News Corporation. Which is owned by Rupert Murdoch. Who owns FOX News and all of its affiliate channels. MarketWatch has a huge influence from its higher ups to push an agenda considering Murdoch has been investigated multiple time for pushing certain agendas through his many media outlets. Agendas that directly benefit him and his buddies at the top.

03/13/2021,stocks,Way better to read 10-Ks and 10-Qs.
03/13/2021,stocks,I agree. I have stock advisor and rule breakers a try and it’s night hand day versus their free stuff. In my opinion those services are worth it if you can get it on a discount.
03/13/2021,stocks,I agree 100%
03/13/2021,stocks,What are the tools they provide access to for their paid subscribers ?
03/13/2021,stocks,"I don’t understand why contradictory opinions from Fool writers/podcasters are seen as a bad thing here. Do we prefer the company force employees to promote a stock they don’t believe in?

Contradictory opinions are vital in researching a stock. I always seek these reasons not to buy a company before making an investment. It’s no different then when purchasing something off Amazon, check the 1- and 3-star reviews to see why people didn’t like the item. You then get to determine if they are legit reasons you should be concerned about or if you research shows you think that reason is incorrect or not an actual concern."
03/13/2021,stocks,"I agree. 

There’s  no way I’d ever pay for anything more than the basic Stock Advisor service, but it’s a decent value for the money. It’s interesting to see people shit on Motley Fool and simultaneously sing Cathy Wood’s praises. Look at their stock picks and portfolios. They’re aren’t identical, but they’re are awful close."
03/13/2021,stocks,Do they provide in-house analysis or just access to sell-side analyst reports ? Do they provide a three statement model and DCF model for their recommendations to their paid subscribers ?

03/13/2021,stocks,"Those are headlines from blog posts by motley fool users LMFAO love this sub

Also: welcome to the finance world. If you want quality DD, you’re gonna have to pay for it. Almost all of the info/analysis services at this point have “free” branches posting the same stuff you’re complaining about. Motley Fool’s premium service grants access to quality DD by professional analysts and fund managers, as with any other similar service."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Their paid service is completely different. Take Stock Advisor for example, the two brothers (Tom and David Gardner) recommend stocks based on the data collection from junior analysts and give you the reasoning. They are always bullish on what they recommend. If you hold 15 of their recommendations with equal weight, in the last 5 years the annualized return is probably 20%-30%. This assumes average luck, because about 20% of their recommendations are wrong, while maybe 20% beat the 20-30% annual return handsomely.

Of course, they are riding the tide of a rare bull market. Their membership growth happened mostly in the last 10 years. However even in a bull market, if for $99 per year you get 20-30% return, I'd say that's impressive.

I guess the real key is their philosophy to buy and hold, and not holding is the most common mistake retail investors make in a bull market. The Fool members are more likely to hold longer - you paid for the service, so you listen to their advice more carefully, just like we are likely to visit the gym with paid membership than a free gym at work or residence.

With that said, the junior analysts who do all the footwork are allowed to publish analyses on their Motley Fool blog, and those articles only represent that analyst's opinion. In my opinion I don't blame Motley Fool if those analyses were wrong, because Motley Fool didn't take credits for the right ones either. I guess the junior analysts who get more clicks, and publish more ""right"" predictions, will get a brighter career path at Fool.

Of course, if you are talking about the aggressive marketing, I am with you. I block most of their emails. However, I do believe they are running a legit and good business."

I don't know what the hate is about, although I'm still on the fence about whether the recommendations are helpful enough for me to reduce ( not eliminate) the time I spend researching.

But I do agree that the free articles, especially those of motley and benzinga are filled with cringeworthy clickbait. Stock advisor still rocks though (atleast for now)."
03/13/2021,stocks,"But the AMEX promotion,  which I did as well (because it was free), was for a year.  As in you've paid for a year subscription and can cancel before the following year."

Found GRWG. Someone on board for it on ST there mentioned HYFM as new IPO. So I bought that. Then AGFY came out and I found out thanks to HYFM board. I didn't buy that BUT I did follow it and found UGRO cross ticker post there

UGRO is absurdly undervalued and I found it before the crowd. That's when the easiest gains are made. It's still an unknown gem. Go to the Stockwits page for it to see more! Also Reddit had a post somewhere IIRC

Also consider looking through holdings in interesting ETFs like the ARKs, MOON, LRNZ, BTEC, IPO, PBW

Which is why I believe MF pumps these companies after they have made say 20 % plus . So not only have they made money already on the company but also have made money from you buying into their subscriptions and when everybody follows they make even more money.

Some research has disproportionately more women, but most are for more men.  Same goes for lack of POC.

If you want to see change, make your data super publicly available and convince lots of other women and POC to also give up their data, their privacy, and volunteer for research studies.

I work in NLP and comments like these are a huge pet peeve for me. AI ethicists (unless they are actually coming up with solutions) are no better than sensationalist journalists. 

And besides the point, voice recognition is very good with both genders anyway.

A much more relevant complaint would be how it works much worse with Southern accents and AAVE than it does for white women, but ""AI hates rednecks and black people"" doesn't fit an agenda."

> We first recommended Under Armour (NYSE: UA) (NYSE: UAA) in 2006 and rerecommended it in 2007 and 2016. It was making waves with performance attire and shoes and even getting into wearable fitness with the acquisition of MyFitnessPal in 2015. It edged into Nike's (NYSE: NKE) and adidas' (OTC: ADDY.Y) brand recognition territory and signed massive sponsorship deals with athletes like Steph Curry and Lindsey Vonn.

>However, the ensuing years have not been kind to a company that was once a winner on our scorecard. Consistent sales decline, a refusal to pivot into athleisure, and the closing of retailers like Sports Authority and Sport Chalet have all hurt its top and bottom lines. So have allegations of misconduct throughout the company and Kevin Plank, the visionary founder, leaving the CEO spot at the end of 2019. All of this to say we are putting Under Armour in the penalty box.

>The Foolish Bottom Line

>We aren't ready to throw the towel in for Under Armour completely yet. The new CEO, Patrik Frisk, has implemented cost-saving measures while working through restructuring and an overhaul of company culture. The market for performance wear is still strong, and there's a chance for Under Armour to regain market share with its known brand. But there is a lot of uncertainty in its future, and it hasn't lived up to expectations yet, leading us to Box it. This is why we're recommending you steer clear of Under Armour stock if you don't yet own it, and instead put excess capital to work in our latest recommendations or Best Buys Now."

It's not just about the numbers and projections. The more I invest the more I realize most of this is psychology and we as humans shouldn't trust ourselves or our ability to handle the FUD that can sink into anyone if pushed too far by extreme market conditions. The March 2020 dip was extreme both down and up. Imagine if we had to wait 5 years to be where we are today. I think people would give up on most of their portfolio after a year of spinning our wheels. 

So yeah I actually do hope Lemonade does well even if I sit on the sidelines and watch the rise. All insurance needs disruption. Just not for me."
03/13/2021,stocks,"I think it's important to be careful with biases associated with motley fool (or ARK) and Teledoc. It's not to say you shouldn't use it as part of your DD. I'm just as guilty as the next person so I'm not calling you out by any means. 

In this case I'm only concerned with Teledoc. It's been on my radar for almost three years and I've slowly built a position over the last year. I didn't know until today MF even recommended them. I did know about ARK. 

There's going to be entrants to the market, but it doesn't mean they'll succeed. Look at Nikola and Lords town motors in the EV sector. It's not as easy as it appears to scale successfully and continue to grow year after year. 

One Medical is one competitor but they're not the same business model as they have clinic's and telehealth services under one subscription. They're also limited geographically. It's one to keep an eye on. 

Oscar recently went public and while they have the digital stack available both directly and to license (lemonade of health insurance) they are also a different model. They do have Oscar medical which is being rolled out in a few major cities over the last year but they too use Teledoc for after hours and overflow. I know this because my wife works for Oscar medical. 

I don't remember the source but over the next half decade the TAM for telemedicine is expected to be about $200b, of which TDOC has less than 1% of. Point being, there's a ton of room in this growing industry and I expect there to be a handful of similar but possibly different variants of the model to survive and thrive. My money is on the oldest and most experienced business that is already providing international access to US based doctors and nurses. 

I think it's also important to note that this isn't going to replace every visit. That would be a ridiculous assumption. It will however reduce costs for everyone involved while also being more efficient (and convenient). It can serve as an intermediate to assist in directing you to who you need to see and what your options are. If it's just a prescription they can handle it from your phone. The opportunities are endless, especially with the Livongo merger. Just need to let them do their thing and continue to grow as they see fit. 

On that note Teledoc took a massive hit with the rotation out of growth/tech. They also are lumped in with the stay at home stocks. Basically were pummeled into a 30%+ drop over the course of like three weeks. It's on sale and I don't see it going below ~$180. 

Right now TDOC is 6-7% of my portfolio which is good enough for my second largest stock position (most in index funds)."

I have no issue with different opinions, but they are clearly bought and pais for.

03/13/2021,stocks,"Actually I am a female engineer and a large reason that inventions have been built for men is because they have made and standardized things using men as the test subjects to represent a product (like Siri or a car) that’s supposed to work for all people of different heights, sizes and ages. But instead of using both the average male and the average female to design the product they only used the average male.

Edit: by trying to make a one sized fit all solution but only using the average male to base the “size” off of, you get a product that is actually not one size fit all, but works for most men."
03/13/2021,stocks,"They’re the size they are because they easily fit in the average males hand. They could have been standardized to a different size, but they weren’t. It’s not impactful unless you’re a bricklayer with smaller hands."

03/13/2021,stocks,"AC settings are determined by a program based on average body temperature and desired temperature. Statistically men prefer rooms 2 degrees colder than women and that is what AC programs are set to. Is this greatly impactful? No you can wear a sweater, but what is important is that products are designed for a whole spectrum of people to use. Just like roller coasters have to be designed with a spectrum of heights and weights in mind and tell consumers who can ride, we expect that of many products - like Siri and automobiles when these things actually aren’t designed for a spectrum of users. 
Bricks also aren’t a big deal, but are still a product that was designed to fit a mans hand. This is because historically men made and laid bricks. What’s important nowadays is that tools can work for a variety of people. As a woman who works on construction sites I can tell you some tools work better for my male coworkers- sometimes this is a strength thing and other females don’t have an issue and other times this is something that could have been designed better to function for a variety of heights."

See: https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/22/health/women-temperature-tests.html Also, most products tend to be designed either by men, or with more men in the focus groups bc women don’t have much time for those things. And yes, they really did a disservice to women with Siri and Alexa. I can’t use voice searches bc it doesn’t register my voice accurately. My seatbelt cuts into my neck. I can’t reach the touch screen without leaning forward. I slide off airplane seats because my feet don’t reach the ground and the headrest makes me tip my head forward for the whole flight. I’m not actually that tiny, shorter but not abnormally so. Tools are all a little too heavy and a little too large to wrap my hand around (like trying to hold a baseball bat by the wrong end). Me weed whacker is too heavy (and I am pretty strong). It’s hard to hold a brick with one hand because the width is just a little too wide for normal gripping muscles to engage efficiently. My kitchen counter is a couple inches too high for good leverage when cutting things. The kitchen sink faucet is set far enough back that I cannot reach the water without leaning forward. This makes my back hurt when doing dishes. Pianos are designed for men’s hands and female piano players wind up with more stress injuries on account of the sizing being wrong. Maximum profit would be actually designing products with women in mind and creating a “niche market” for the other half of humanity. Apologies for going off on this, it’s just all been on my mind since I read [Invisible Women by Caroline Criado Perez](https://www.amazon.com/Invisible-Women-Data-World-Designed/dp/1419729071) It’s a great source for anyone who wants to know more!"

I'm 6'7"" tall and trust me, no car is built for me either.  A fender bender could easily leave me without legs.  I don't go around saying it's because cars are all built for women and not men.

Edit: I actually looked up brick sizes and it seems that in th UK at least a brick tax was implemented in the later 1700s. In response to this, people began manufacturing larger and larger bricks as the tax applied to number of units not overall weight. They ditched the brick tax in 1850 but by then a lot of brick manufacturers had moved to machine moulded bricks and the sizes were set for those machines so the larger sizes stuck."

You make the setting so it is most comfortable for the people who cannot do anything within reason to adapt?  Men can't take their shirts and socks off at work, but a female can easily bring a sweater and wear that.  So should the men just be uncomfortable with no reasonable solution just so the women don't have to be inconvenienced by having to add a sweater?  This feel unfair to me at a base level.

In fact, the formula may overestimate female metabolic rate by as much as 35%, meaning that current offices are on average five degrees too cold for women. This leads to the odd sight of female office workers wrapped in blankets in the summer, while their male colleagues wander around in shorts.”

Granted, I am not usually so whiny, but I felt like countering the mansplaining answer(s) with some of my small everyday experiences to highlight that there remains a discrepancy.

Nor that I’ve a job I love in a supportive environment, etc. It’s just that life could be just a little bit better if computer keyboards came in slightly smaller sizes, I could reach more than the bottom two shelves of the kitchen cabinets, etc. I’d just like it if men could spend a day or two noticing what household things are at the right height for them (Light switches? Shower handle? Chair height?) Mirrors? Paper towel dispensers? Coffee maker?) and maybe think about whether the women in their lives could use everyday objects at a different height, or weight.

> Next Steps
1. The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) currently requires safety testing using dummies modeling average and small male bodies, but **not 95th percentile males, elderly people, obese people, pregnant women, or female bodies (the 5th percentile female is a scaled-down male dummy).** The European New Car Assessment Programme (Euro NCAP) utilizes the same Hybrid III dummies as prescribed by the U.S. NHTSA, and as a result does not model a wide range of bodies in crash tests (Euro NCAP, 2010; Euro NCAP, 2009; Linder, A., & Svedberg W., 2019; Linder, A., & Svensson, M., 2019). Governments should mandate vehicle safety testing using crash test dummies or simulations that represent the anatomical features of **both the 50th percentile female and male, pregnant, obese, tall, and elderly bodies.**

Emphasis mine.  It looks like at least the top 5% sized women are represented currently.  Which is more than I am as a top 5% male.  Interesting, thanks for the link!"

2021-03-13 06:39:27,stocks,"Change my mind: Technical Analysis is complete bullshit It’s pathetic to me browsing subreddits and seeing post after post talking about how XYZ is forming a double zenith ultra harmonic convergence and is about to break out to the moon when in reality there is no merit to this “pattern”  whatsoever and the stock continues to move with randomness.

It’s even more pathetic when WSB tries to use TA, something that predicts movement based off of *patterns*, on GME, a stock that has had a completely unprecedented rise and is solely governed by sources such as news, tweets, hedge funds and market makers. 

I physically cringe anytime I see “DD” that involves a chart and every time I do see one, I instantly discredit the entire post. There have been many studies that prove the natural randomness of the stock market overshadows any patterns and predictions that could be made and your chance of predicting a stocks movement off of TA is basically that of a coin flip. Fundamental analysis, news and the current trend and sentiment of the market are infinitely more important for predicting a stocks immediate movement than TA could ever be.

The only glimmer of credibility I’d be willing to give TA is scalping but even then 90% of daytraders lose money so id say it’s not even paying off for them well in that regard either.

What it feels like to me is TA is a “noob trap” that attracts people who are new to the stock market because it makes them feel like they know what they are doing and they want an excuse to just gamble away their money. I’ve noticed a lot of YouTube channels prey off of people thinking they’re some God of the stock market for employing TA and it gives them false credibility when in reality they’re just guessing as much as anyone.

Basic technical analysis can be extremely useful for finding great potential buy points for swings and possibly long-term investments (buying dips/reversals at key moving averages). It is also about identifying breadth, trends, price momentum, etc., not just in individual stocks but the overall market as well. Almost everyone should at least be aware of the 20/50/200 moving averages in my opinion. 

Hell, basic technical analysis is in a portion of the curriculum for investments classes in several universities in my area. So it should not be dismissed as “astrology” or a “scam”. People should be more open-minded towards different tools to potentially improve their investing."

Does the casino need to know with absolute certainty what each hand on each table yield? No.
Because the probabilities are set in its favour.

Coming back to the stock market, I don't need TA to provide me with absolute certainties, all I need is for it to give me a statistical edge that yields more profit than loss over time.

We can go into great detail figuring out why TA gives that edge, but. I think I made my point.

If enough people believe TA works, then it may as well start to work! It is the same thing as with Bitcoin or $GME - if enough people believe it is the best store of value and the best asset and the price broke an ascending triangle or whatever, the price will go up.

Even something as simple as a 200 SMA (200-day simple moving average) can help you make **decisions** (not predict the future). Paul Tudor Jones used it to avoid both the 1987 crash and the 2020 COVID crash [https://www.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/8fu44e/why\_do\_people\_keep\_dismissing\_technical\_analysis/](https://www.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/8fu44e/why_do_people_keep_dismissing_technical_analysis/)

You will get a lot of false signals and I personally would say my decisions are 95 % fundamental and perhaps 5 % ""technical"" (I look at the chart - do I like it?) but I would not dismiss TA as astrology or bullshit.

I suggest reading a few of the **Market Wizards** series books from Jack Schwager - [https://jackschwager.com/books-by-js/](https://jackschwager.com/books-by-js/) \- the traders interviewed are successul, it is statistically significant, their results are independently verified and 70%+ of them use some form of TA or another.

03/13/2021,stocks,"Charts are a representation of human emotion. Human emotion is somewhat predictable. The emotions you feel when the price moves is felt by many others. In no way is it 100% reliable just as anything else isn’t. Those prices that change from day to day is only a price, it’s what people are willing to pay for X on any given day. Price is determined by buying and selling which is based on human emotions. I don’t count entirely on TA regularly, only for when the opportunities present themselves."
03/13/2021,stocks,"That’s probably because you don’t know how to use it, just because it’s not perfect doesn’t mean it’s bullshit. There are many good day traders & swing traders who make consistent profits based on TA analysis. 

I use TA myself and it’s fairly accurate (75%+) at predicting the next move. When $SPY hit $395 a couple days ago it had moved above my channels and hit the edge of my regression line. This indicated to me that it will bounce back down, so I shorted it.

Within 2 hours it had dropped all the way back below my channels and came close to the bottom of my regression line, so I sold my puts for a nice profit. 

TA absolutely does work, you just need to learn how to use them and just understand that it’s not always perfect. As long as it works “most” of the time, you will make consistent profits."
03/13/2021,stocks,"It’s not complete bullshit, but it’s not everything either.

Okay, so now that *that's* out of the way, here's a perspective. Let's assume you're a growth investor who wants to be more aggressive than just riding the SPY.

  
1. Since you're a growth investor, that means the stock price matters to you (as opposed to dividend buys, where you care more about the dividend than the price movement).

2. How do you inform your purchases? You probably looked at some data. Earnings, debts, etc. Those are numbers that you have decided are important to your strategy.

3. Looking at those numbers in a vacuum doesn't mean much; but you probably looked at the last few quarters or years for *trend* data. Is the company growing or shrinking? That's probably important.

4. You probably then looked at industry numbers. Is the sector growing/shrinking? How is company A doing compared to it's competitor company B? Even better, is company B also *trending* in a good direction?

5. Now you've got numbers on 10-15 companies in a sector. That's a lot of numbers to compare, so let's make it a bit easier to interpret by *plotting the numbers*. Looks like company A is indeed outperforming, but maybe not by as much as you though based on the seemingly normal fluctuations of the sector. This may inform your purchase.

Okay, that's how you do it with fundamentals in all likelihood.

Now my question is- what drives a stock price? *People.* The stock doesn't go up in response to earnings, the stock goes up when *people* buy it because they think rising earnings are a good thing.

So instead of plotting earnings over time, I want to plot *the actions of people* over time. That's the price. I want to go where the party is, because that's where I'm most likely to find a rising price.

But what if more people are leaving this party than coming? What if the people showing up are consuming more beer than they're providing? That's what volume, strength, and momentum indicators are telling us.

...and since people are creatures of habit, their behaviors on a *macro scale* can be tracked, recorded, and seen repeated over and over and over. But, since we're talking human behavior, we're only talking about *statistical likelihoods*, not scientific proofs. Nothing is certain, but if *X* happens, you may want to expect *Y* to happen next...most of the time.

That's it.

If you want another, simpler argument: if algos didn't work, they wouldn't be making millions on Wall Street. That's the bank telling you ""yes, this makes us shit-tons of money."""

Obviously the thing that experienced traders will tell you is the main thing is psychology and managing the trade. You can enter at almost any time, without any indicators or bullshit and you can go long or short, just depends on how you manage the trade and how big your balls and accounts are"

Then bots would make plays based on the previous trades further exacerbating the classical formations. Basically it's now bots all the way down."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Normally I think it's bullshit, since some people swear by it, it kinda becomes their trading guide/rule book, so it has some merit.

I find it very similar to economists,  only once the event has occurred they are able to explain why it happened, and their explanations are oh so good."
03/13/2021,stocks,"so I thought along the same way as you, especially since I had a traditional finance education...I saw valuations intrinsically tied with Gordon Growth and DCF models and thought lowly of technicals.

my opinion has softened over the years because let's be honest, whether you believe it's a legitimate way to make an investment decision or not, MANY many other people do choose to use TA. it's kinda like religion, whether or not you believe it is irrelevant, because it's undeniable that it influences people in how they invest their money.

and there is something to be said about the power of momentum in pricing movement, which TA does capture. I think nowadays you have to at least have an understanding of technicals and the role it plays"

03/13/2021,stocks,"Technical analysts says the same thing about fundamental analysts.  There rationale is your looking at information that’s  based on the past. There dd is based on what’s happening in real time.

Past performance doesn’t always predict future performance. Some stocks won’t ever rebound. Likewise some growth stocks will never make a profit.

Personally I feel it’s best combining the two for mid cap stocks.  There not tiny where a piece of news can drastically alter the company and not to large where they still got room to run. 

Keep an eye on 5-10 stocks with great fundamentals, with great growth and plenty of room to run. Wait to see when the big boys are starting there positions and go for the ride. When it slows down move it into the next one that starts forming."

Then you can say to yourself, if there is a catalyst in either direction, the stock will be higher or lower on Friday, etc.  

So for me, I still analyze patterns when deciding when to buy or sell, as well as trying to keep my finger on the catalysts.  

Funny thing is, even if I miss a catalyst, I will likely see the results in the data.  Sometimes it is too late though, like if I miss when a dividend is going to pay out, etc."

I think people need to treat technical analysis something like the P/E of a stock, it’s helpful but you sure as hell do not buy solely on that. I think you have to combine technical analysis with something like events unfolding with a company, similar to how you get extra DD beyond seeing a P/E below 15."

03/13/2021,stocks,Technical Analysis is LITERALLY pseudoscience. You can flip a coin on a stock without doing any technical research and still have similar odds to someone who did. You're better off learning fundamental analysis because at least you're measuring tangible assets. All research done on the topic have always been mixed results and everything positive on it have been shown to have biases. This isn't warhammer orc logic where if you think it works then it works.

So if it affects hedge funds and ETFs then yeah you would want to follow it.  There's probably some merit to those charts.

TA is a lot more about trading and helping select your entry, rebuy, and exit points.  Other criteria should be used to decide ‘if’ you should be investing in this stock in the first place...

There is also enough people that believe in TA that is can be a self fulfilling prophecy.  If a bunch of traders and algos will always buy a certain pattern- when it occurs you could have an influx of buys- in turn creating the base for a price move."

03/13/2021,stocks,It's community knowledge.  The only power it has is that so many people believe things like morning star actually mean something (despite the fact that if you change the time resolution it goes away) that they act on it so if you're watching and believing the same thing you can profit off the action they are taking.  If we could reach into reality and rewrite what these patterns *have always meant* then every time they've actually predicted something (i.e. was the dominant factor) would now go the exact opposite way despite nothing changing but the convention.

03/13/2021,stocks,Look the efficient market hypothesis and the random walk hypothesis are called a hypothesis because they are a hypothesis. A convenient mathematical fiction that underlies lots of things like options pricing theories. But the fact that they help us price options better does not make them scientific theories or thruth. As far as I know study results are a mixed bag. Traders use price information everyday. Hedge funds use sophisticated statistical models. Maybe simple TA is dead. Maybe it's not. What's important is to test whatever TA you are going with if you want to have any confidence in it working.
03/13/2021,stocks,"The thing that's always bugged me about TA is that it's for short-term trading usually. When you're doing short-term, you're not in the boat with everyone else; you're on your own boat trying to be one of the first ones to make a move in the next direction. In that case, how could an individual trader compete using formulaic patterns? Everyone at least slightly serious about trading can see these patterns. So what makes you and your patterns better than the competitors and their patterns? Is it the speed at which you can act? Or the patterns you follow? An investment firm with AI is going to be quicker than you and is going to choose better patterns since they have teams of programmers and analysts. Maybe there is some truth to the patterns, but I think the regular people hanging out at their 8 monitor desk at home aren't going to be able to really beat investment firms at that game."
03/13/2021,stocks,"On any intraday time frame, watch the size of the breakout candle near the end point of a pattern and tell me it isn’t larger than the average candle range. Do this with a ticker that has substantially abnormal (relative) volume and it’s undeniable.  TA pattern setups are self-fulfilled movements because there are enough technical traders to support volatile movements near the breakout point of the patterns. Of course you aren’t going to accurately predict the future movement of a ticker, but you can absolutely gain a better idea of levels of support/resistance/breakout.

TA provides us with little bits of info that can help us paint the picture of HOW a stock is trading, rather than WHY.  However, I agree with you that it's bullshit to predict future stock movements using TA."
03/13/2021,stocks,"TA without context is a waste of time. TA with context can be useful in conjunction with other research. So it’s a no from me dawg on this opinion.

TA is never meant to be a prediction, it’s more of a way to give you a better chance then you would have if you ignored the signals."
03/13/2021,stocks,"I'm going to order a book on TA some time in the future, I don't want to dismiss what I don't understand... But I was introduced to TA before I knew anything about stocks at all, by a guy who was hammered at a bar showing me charts on his phone and yelling. Really primed me for internet DD."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Completely agree, fundamentals are what matter. Though I will say that I find charts extremely useful. I’ve been flamed by people on here screaming “past performance does not indicate future performance,” so far, for me, it has. I like to use charts and RSI to see when things are below value visually and then confirm it by doing DD on the stock. I think TA should be used primarily as a tool to locate opportunities."
03/13/2021,stocks,"I don't think it's bullshit. It's definitely not always right either. For me though,as a datrader mostly, it's right more times than it's wrong which consistently makes me money. I  use 5 min candles and and base my day trades accordingly.  It's also dependent on the stock and how easily it's influenced by upcoming news obviously,so you can't decide strictly on what the chart says. I think enough of us daytraders use these same signals that it works often enough for me."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Technical analysis is a very bad way to predict price movement and predict successful trades, I totally agree with that.

But it can be a very good tool to pinpoint trades that are bad and should be avoided.

For example, if you want to buy a stock, you should probably wait if the price is above the Bollinger bands. The same if the stochastic is above the 80% line (assuming a well-calibrated TA, not configured to verify bias).

It does not mean that you will 100% make money if you buy when it's below the Bollinger bands or if the stochastic is below 20%. It just eliminates a few red flags and points at a potential opportunity that you should further investigate.

Of course, all this is irrelevant for super-high-volatility markets"
03/13/2021,stocks,"Agreed. The only parts that have merit are support/resistance levels, usually related to the moving averages. You can see daily candles that will bounce off the same levels again and again.

All that other shit is just useless. Seems like every pattern has a nice name, and if someone can't find some TA that fits their outlook they'll just zoom out to the weekly/monthly chart and find a pattern there.

During some wild market periods last year I remember finding the Kendall Report on YouTube - someone who has spent his life doing TA. I'm convinced the only way he makes money is through the course/platform he promotes, since his predictions were just consistently wrong."

But it will go back sooner or later."
03/13/2021,stocks,"I get your point, and tend to agree on its merits. Do not forget however that if many people follow the pattern, it becomes a thing. Furthermore I heard from a (real) analyst once, that in reality only the big consultancy firms can do fundamental analysis, as only they possess the data, knowledge and infrastructure. Random redditor doing a fundamental analysis is not a solid fundamental analysis. All that retail investors have is the TA patterns, that is their playground."

03/13/2021,stocks,I think you’re presenting it as a zero sum game. TA is just a methodology to TRY to predict the price movement of stocks based on historical trends of price movement. I don’t feel it’s much different from the concept that buy and hold is bulletproof. Some companies end up performing like shit over a 20 year period. That doesn’t mean buy and hold doesn’t work. Sometimes the TA and price setup make perfect sense then something random happens and blows it all up. Doesn’t mean TA doesn’t work
03/13/2021,stocks,"> There have been many studies that prove the natural randomness of the stock market overshadows any patterns and predictions that could be made and your chance of predicting a stocks movement off a TA is basically that of a coin flip

Stocks are theoretically based on the strength of a company.  But once calls and shorts and options start entering the equation, it's less about the company and more about the actions of others. ""Stock X will go up but not by much so not worth the risk.... There are a ton of shorts and lots of people are buying, maybe I want in.""  So FA is about companies and industries and trends, where as TA is about the actions of investors.  I wonder if the skill mentioned on previous comments is about determining appropriate weight to each.  I sold GME at $150 because I don't believe the company will be able to justify that price, but clearly I didn't weigh the social element enough."
03/13/2021,stocks,I watched a lot of TA channels when I started stonkin'. Now I watch none and pretty much my whole strategy is just trying to calculate intrinsic value as accurately as I can.
03/13/2021,stocks,Read some academic articles in the Journal of Technical Analysis. TA isn’t perfect but it’s not 100% bullshit either.
03/13/2021,stocks,"DD and TA are foundations. Is the share price built on concrete or balancing on matchsticks?

Sure GME's price is up there, but the bottom could fall out any minute and could go back to $20–$40 quickly because there is no underlying reason about the company for it to be trading in the mid $200's. This is an external show down between a few whales, HF's and retail traders with the random cryptic tweet from Cohen coupled with some positive news shooting it back up again.

All that information for say AAPL, is why that stock won't plummet from $120 to $40 overnight and bounce back up to $250 and then settle again at $25. There's a solid foundation under the share price that will keep it from being volatile."

&#x200B;

The reason TA is BS is simply this: The instantaneous value of a stock is essentially stochastic but TA is heavily dependent on the instantaneous value. E.g., If there is a spike then some TA will grab that spike, but the spike is imaginary. It could be totally different without the underlying fundamentals changing at all. Basically if S(t) is the stock price then there is a stochastic element, e.g., e(t) and the stock price people get is S(t) + e(t). e(t) is significantly large that conclusions drawn about the underlying value is going to have significant error, e.g., 10% or more.  Basically all the little random movements a stock makes is error that will throw off any analysis that doesn't smooth out the data. TA should be done, at the very least, on a moving average... yet it isn't.

&#x200B;

All that is ignoring the fact that stock prices are essentially non-stationary and memoryless(or very short term memory). 1. A stocks value can change on a dime changing the entire dynamics). If you treat it as stationary then you will get screwed when those changes happen(which could happen every stock trade if someone is manipulating the stock or fundamentals). 2. A stock's value 10 years ago is virtually no indication of how a stock's value is today. Ok, then what is the time when it will indicate? 5 years? 2 years? 2 months? 1 day? How far back can we go in time to use that stocks price to predict the current or future price? Well, probably a few days max. It's like weather, it is impossible to predict it to any accuracy more than a few minutes head. Yes, some patterns can be drawn for global analysis but there is an innate chaotic aspect to these types of phenomena that prevent true prediction.

If TA worked then you wouldn't hear about it. It might give some people a slight edge but the way people just blindly apply it so they can justify their desires makes it in to a religion. WORSHIP THE CUP, NECK, AND CROSS!"
03/13/2021,stocks,"TA is much like the black jack card counting myth perpetuated by the casinos. My wife and I tested thousands of hands using various methods and concluded its total bs.  And we watched tables in Vegas where people who just a read a book thought they were going to clean up.

One couple lost $20K in minutes, and by the look on their faces, it might have been all their savings.

Similarly, I learned the bs of TA back in the 90s. One simple immutable rule proves TA is nonsense: Past performance is no indicator of future performance."
03/13/2021,stocks,I love this post and every comment in it
03/13/2021,stocks,"I'll admit I roll my eyes when I see somebody rambling about a cup and handle or some kind of bullshit like that.  It's easy to dismiss when you people overstating its relevance.   
 But I will say this...  Many institutional trades are executed by computers.  Obviously these processes are controlled by algorithms.  Algorithmic ""thought"" does tend to form patterns.  Patterns that replicate due to the core rules of the algorithms themselves.  So generally I agree and I wouldn't base all of my DD on TA.  But, it does (I believe) give us a glimpse into computer ""thinking"" with regard to market trends.  So it can be worth considering when looking at the big picture.  It's the human element that throws the market into true randomness.  Stocks like GME and AMC are prime examples.  I think for stocks with high percentage institutional ownership TA may be a little more of a factor than for stocks with a lot of retail investor ownership/interest.  


Also, obviously, looking at historical price and movement can provide you with very relevant data.  I look at TA more for long term analysis of a stock."
03/13/2021,stocks,"100% agree with that, there isn't anything as psycho or social thing involved, they believe in it cuz they want to"
03/13/2021,stocks,"Can't change your mind, but think of this:

All technical analysis is doing is trying to look at a chart and guess what happens. If you disagree with the very idea of technical analysis, are you saying you've never done that? You would never look at a stock mid-day and say, ""where will it be at close?"" I don't think so. I think you're curious as the rest of us about predicting charts.

I agree with you, though, that a good deal of technical analysis feels horoscope-y. Then again, my spouse and I have complimentary starsigns...

Thank you for your time. Have a good day."
03/13/2021,stocks,"In theory fundamentals tell you what to buy and technicals tell you when. In practice? Technicals are like any other thing in your life that exist to reduce risk or increase success. They're a part of a whole, not a golden bullet. An oscillating toothbrush is more effective than a manual one but for most people just manually brushing their teeth still reduces their risk of oral health issues. But even brushing your teeth is no guarantee you don't develop gingivitis. Your oscillating toothbrush though may decrease your risk a bit more than just the manual one. Same thing with technicals. They don't turn you into a successful trader. They are an oscillating toothbrush, there to help you decrease risk or increase success. A tool, nothing more. Traders who use to volume indicators in conjunction with momentum indicators may just be using that data to see if a price level they already determined to be their comfortable entry point is being sustained or maybe to see if the recent average true range is outside their predetermined risk tolerance. You develop rules for yourself as a trader and stick by those rules. Technicals are a tool, not the whole solution."

03/13/2021,stocks,"If I can make an assumption, it sounds like you’re a little too focused on others. Perhaps you can share a personal experience with TA and how it worked out for you, good or bad.

In my experience; the independent use of TA yields mixed results. When coupled with other factors it has been more successful. For me it works best in a 3-5 week time frame. 

Although I believe it’s the most valuable tool in the bag, it just depends how each trader utilizes these helpful tools/indicators."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Every time I see a technical analysis it just screams apophenia. If you stare at any chart for long enough you will start to see patterns.

03/13/2021,stocks,Broken clock is right twice a day.
03/13/2021,stocks,"Agreed, but that hasn't stopped things like astrology (in my belief, the equivalent of TA) from being a prominent force in the human game.

And I'm still out on whether or not human perception has the power to effect reality; or at least affects the perception itself, making the difference less consequential."
03/13/2021,stocks,"You’re looking at TA and applying it all wrong. It’s not a fucking crystal ball dude. But it tells the story of how the stock trades. Where most buyers believe fair prices are, where most traders think the sellers come in, when a massive amount of people see something on the chart and trade according to that indicator, it becomes true because they push their money around that strategy. This is why breakouts are a thing. You’re telling me it’s 100% coincidence, that when an obvious established trendline breaks, just *magically* an increase in volume and volatility follow? Lol come on. 


TA is going to give you a plan for each scenario, whether the market goes up or down. Its literally all the information of the entire history of how the stock trades. If a stock is at 63 and a year long trendline as support at 61. You don’t know what happens with the market tomorrow. But you do know if we go red and the 61 support holds a lot of other traders will buy. 

TA tells you if you’re buying a stock that has momentum behind it or if you’re buying a stock that has a ton of winners already looking to sell. TA tells you where the volume is, at what prices, if you see monster volume at a base followed by a run up and a drop off of volume and RSI divergence? Yea TA is telling you that momentum is dying off and you’re likely to get a better price later on at some point. 

If you think TA is nonsense I think you’ve never bothered to take the time to study it. It’s just market data, not magic. And market data is useful when you’re actively trading in that exact same market.

There are 100% real people who do trade for a living. Believe it or not, they exist, I’ve met them, and yes they do trade for a living. Try telling those guys that TA is fake bullshit and how they’ve built all their wealth on coin flips

Just because most wannabe day traders misapply TA and fuck up their trades doesn’t mean that TA has no meaning. That’s like watching a bunch of new golfers play golf and standing up in front of a bunch of pros to reveal your conclusion that landing your ball on the green from the tee box is pure luck, because it only worked half the time for the idiots you were watching earlier that day."
03/13/2021,stocks,"I’m reading a book that talks about tech analysis and it states that even tho it’s most likely bogus if enough people believe it ends up being self fulfilling.

03/13/2021,stocks,Hmm things like resistance are usually useful tho.
03/13/2021,stocks,"I can’t say for sure if TA is of any use because I have never tried to use TA in my investments, but I get what OP is saying. I always get annoyed when someone talks about a stock poised to head up or down and then when it doesn’t he makes up a new excuse to justify why he was wrong."
03/13/2021,stocks,"I also don't like TA

However, I've recently been wondering if TA has some merit.  It might indirectly capture underlying psychology and/or short-term frictions 
... Not sure

That said if you think you can do better TA than an Algo ... Good luck.  TA is easy to program and execute quickly.  Any advantage will be gone before a retailer could execute a trade.

Side note, I do hate TA when they look at two random points and draw a line between it and say it's a trend line ... Idiotic."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Yeah its like squeezing a goat’s testicles for an answer, or a wish in the well."
03/13/2021,stocks,"My issue with TA is that it attempts to predict what others are going to do next and front run. 

For those saying the Greeks are TA, how so? The Greeks are properties of options detailing sensitivities and priced in assumptions, no? 

For IV, I think that it can tell you if the option is pricing in the stock move you are trying to hedge, it's a demand indicator for the option. But to use it for prediting a range of movements, I think that is dumb.

That's my take from a value-investing mindset, i.e. ""is this option worth its price?""."
03/13/2021,stocks,I feel like charts can be useful for certain things like discovering patterns or possible pump&dumps but yeah some people do base their complete investing strategy off of charts and sometimes it works for them but I feel more often than not it isn’t reliable. Personally I pay a lot more attention to fundamental analysis but still take a look at the charts of companies I’m consider investing in.
03/13/2021,stocks,"I disagree, I view the stock market as a platform where people bid and ask on stocks based on what they think they are worth. People’s thoughts can be characterized and illustrated by behavioral psychology, and with that said i view price charts more as human behavioral patterns instead of “randomness” like you said. There’s a repetitive, biological, cyclical nature to human behavior which can be seen in both nature and is reflected in stock price charts as well. It’s been well-studied and is a fact. Of course there’s outside influences that can’t be predicted as easily and interfere with the natural repetition of the market such as news and world events, but on average by “technically analyzing” human behavior we can come to better predictions than we would be able to without them or with only speculative analysis."
03/13/2021,stocks,This whole post could be a copy pasta
03/13/2021,stocks,"Change your view of TA to psychology and positioning and you will see why things work . TA is not helpful for lines and shit, it’s helpful because it can show you sentiment which is vital in timing ."
03/13/2021,stocks,"See the purest form of TA is market depth.

I look at the market depth nowadays not the candles. If we can know at which prices the buy and sell orders are accumulating then making money off it is easy"
03/13/2021,stocks,"No you are right, it's all hogwash. My only criteria, or at least my main criteria, for what to buy is: ""Do I personally use this product/service and is it something I think is worthwhile?""

I got NVIDIA because that's the graphics card I always use and it's never let me down.

03/13/2021,stocks,"I mostly agree. Especially with volatile stocks. Patterns don't mean spit with a stock that runs up and down off news, social media, and memes. 
But for narrowly traded stocks with low volume, I believe patterns have merit. Then again I wouldn't know from experience bc I don't mess with boring stocks.
I like em a little on the crazy side."
03/13/2021,stocks,I have seen TA only useful under “normal” conditions. Which to be honest we haven’t seen in over a year. The cycles are there but only under stable conditions at which point you don’t need TA as the predictions are trend or range based and the cycles are obvious. I have been trying to do an ML regressive on basic direction prediction using pretty much every indicator in the book and you better off with a coin toss. I am not saying TA doesn’t work but it there are so many derivations that the analysis part only seems to work retrospectively. I have had a lot more success with market structure.
03/13/2021,stocks,"This is the reason things like CNBC, Bloomberg, etc exist. It is to give a platform so as to get people feeling great about whatever company person is on at the time. Then they all buy the stock, and it rises. Tadaaaa!"

03/13/2021,stocks,It’s true.  If people want to bring up technical analysis you better know everything else first.  Technical analysis is at best supplemental information.
03/13/2021,stocks,"You are somehow correct, when learning about Time Series Analysis you can see that returns of a stock are mostly generated randomly and behave like a random walk.

The same studies show that technicals account for 90% of stock performance over 10 minutes. It's a dichotomy where everything is impacted by technicals, fundamentals, momentum, etc.

Technicals clearly exist and there are HFT firms making bank off of it. It's just not the best for longer term investing."
03/13/2021,stocks,I used to think it was bullshit but not entirely. Volatility ups and downs follow a pattern that is often predictable.  Just because it's not guaranteed doesn't make it complete bullshit

03/13/2021,stocks,"I wouldn’t necessarily call what I do TA, but more so looking at a graph, its trends, and base my daytrading decisions off of how other traders  might be reading the charts as well, where the majority might want to buy or sell a stock to scalp a profit so that I can benefit and mitigate risk. I’m still pretty new but I’ve been able to stay in the green most days"
03/13/2021,stocks,I can’t. Thats facts
03/13/2021,stocks,Reading charts is like reading tea leaves. They work 50% of the time.
03/13/2021,stocks,I tend to agree with you. They only reason it works is because so many see patterns that have repeated themselves and this triggers buys or sells because of past charts. The fact certain similarities occur and then a stock reacts a certain way because of predicted buying and selling is what makes them semi reliable. It’s has nothing to do really with the actual company. Most of the smaller stocks now move because of pump and dump social media accts.
03/13/2021,stocks,"Moving averages seem okay to me but most of it is insane.

03/13/2021,stocks,"Yeah, it's bullshit. If you look at the math, it makes no fucking sense. The only thing I'll say is that some TA works because other traders believe it works, so the herd trader like it's real, which makes those traders easy to manipulate."
03/13/2021,stocks,TA on Reddit is more akin to people reading TSA leaves and telling you to buy stock based on it.

03/13/2021,stocks,"I'm new to trading and I have started to get into the short term swing trades and options part and utilizing TA has significantly helped me find entry and exit positions along with expectations of how things move after my research showed that there is a play to be made. 

I bought a quick daily call for ORCL on Wed after earnings because I was told they had a decent set of earnings but dropped way below the dividend price. Low and behold, half hour past the bell, there was no significant rebound and the RSI indicator showed that it was excessively oversold. So I bought a call and watched. It followed Fibonacci resistances and support with an upward support line and a much flatter resistance line. It was trading over VWAP, the net inflow into the NYSE was strong that day, ORCL constantly staying in the upper sections of the Fibonacci LINES, SAR showed bullish signs and nearly every time it broke resistance and ran up. 

All of that TA gave me information and likely trends to inform if I should stay in or where to look to get out. But it took the fundamentals of knowing how to skim an earnings report, understanding pricing in dividends, and other understandings of fundamental research showed me that there is a play to be had. TA isn't an end all be all, not even close. But to say it's bullshit is as dumb as using it to try and find every pattern that shows up. Stocks run and there *are* patterns to when they will when no other external catalysts are on it. TA helps me see which direction is more likely and if I should wait or take action ."
03/13/2021,stocks,"I don't know.  Charts sometimes show you things that can have a probable impact on future prices, such as floors and parabolic upward curves."
03/13/2021,stocks,Technical pattern of a chart of a stock is formed based on the fundamentals of the stock. So if you are saying that technical analysis is bullshit then you must also accept that fundamental analysis is also bullshit. In that case the entire stock market is bullshit. Unless you're extrapolating stocks like GME and Tesla as the entire stock market.

I also think you’re not very observant or sharp if you haven’t been able to see some legit TA, follow along day to day, or week to week, and notice it actually has a lot of merit.  You’d be surprised.  When it comes to lines of support and resistance...basic basic things like this can give you and upper hand and maximize profits.

Hold for a day, week, sometimes a couple hours, or couple weeks. I do pretty darn well. Always have about 15-20 open positions, average down here and there with gains from others, pick up more small positions on new ones using same method. Fuck all the analysis,  if the chart has a double bottom, triple top, head and shoulders, balls and weiner.....whatever dude, still doesn't mean you can predict the human element of them actually buying or selling. That said, GO AMC! sitting on 750 shares at 5.15. I bought this a while back because of the fact when people come out of their caves from quarantine,  thus is a 15-20 $ stock anyway. If it pops with WSB action, even better, but not counting on it. GME, won't touch it with a 10 ft. Pole. The human element is fucking that stock up so much, you can't possibly apply any normal DD to it, or a graph. Lol. Anyway, don't be a follower, diversify, small positions, multiple positions, NO FOMO- missed money is better than lost money,don't get greedy. I'm always down in some, green in others, cashing out on one or two a day, buying back in so.ewhere else, or avg down a good one. Keep it moving, if your good enough to just pay attention, you can't lose. I might make $500 today, maybe $50, maybe nothing for a couple days, holding red. But I never lose.

03/13/2021,stocks,"I agree and disagree. I would say most of TA is voodoo witchcraft, or whatever you want to call it. But there are some components that technically fit into TA that are really critical to know.

I'll give some examples of important ones:

1) **Option chains**

Most stocks do not have a significant number of options at different strike levels. The ones that typically do these days are the ones that get popular and then are deemed as 'meme stocks'. Because of the increase of public focus, more people pile in thus the stock becomes volatile, particularly when the company that is being invested is a smaller market cap company or has good potential, but has issues in the balance sheet. Thus, the influx of longs will also produce a number of shorts, and voila, volatility. If you can figure out when a stock is going to become volatile, or which will stay volatile, it is possible to use TA to find out when to buy, which can make you a lot of money.

A popular example is GME. This is not just a popular example, but really a rather unparalleled example, a stock that has 10s of thousands of options at 'nice number' strikes, such as 150, 200, 250, 300, etc. Earlier this week (or was it last?), I personally *knew* about the large number of options at 150. I knew that just based on the math alone, the TA that is, that if GME crosses 150, it would probably go straight to 180 or even 200 within the day. So I woke up at 4am PST bought 100 shares and within a few hours I had 25% returns. Just took some investigation into option chains and understanding the technical side of MMs hedging options

*I'm really not a TA guy, FYI. But I do use a few TA tools and ignore the rest*

2) **Insider buys and sells**

Perhaps this is borderline FA and TA, but I'm going to call this TA for this reason. Sometimes a stock is undervalued, and for whatever reason, it just sits being undervalued for a long time. If an insider, or an exec, starts buying shares at a certain price, or if multiple people start buying shares, that's an insider floor. This usually means that this price is a *really* nice place to be, because they know a lot more than you do, and if they're happy with that price point, then so am I. For instance, a number of insiders bought shares of BB right at the 10.00 price, creating a floor for a little while at 10. Ultimately, it dipped below and came back, but either way, that little piece of TA tells me that anytime BB gets near 10, it's a good buying opportunity. Of course, I like the fundamentals of BB a lot more than just going off the TA, but it does help reinforce your own opinions.

3) **200MA vs 50MA**

This one can be significant, and sometimes it's not so significant. It really depends on how often these averages cross and how strongly they have crossed. Finding a company that actually reverses it's business outlook from a negative one to a positive one is rare, and if you can identify a company that might be trending in a better direction, look more into that company! This was the initial thesis behind DFV's look into GME, and in fact, a lot of popular stocks on Reddit have been focusing on turn around stories. It can make you a pretty penny

There's not a lot else that I really think holds a lot of worth in TA, but that's just my opinion. I think everyone should have different values on how to value stocks and interpret how a company will do. There's no need for solidarity!

03/13/2021,stocks,"This. Support and resistance levels are a HUGE deal. I use them in trading all the time and they help a lot. The important thing isn't to take TA as some all knowing infallible answer to the stock market because you throw math at the problem. It's meant to be used to supplement fundamentals and serve as more evidence that the probability of an event happening is likely. By shying away from stocks that don't have support levels because they've experienced nothing but growth, people would have avoided a lot of the tech selloff. The more you get into TA the more overly analytical and masturbatory it becomes I'd say. You run the risk of either doing it incorrectly or supporting your own biases. Stick to the basics, which arguably is for the best because that's what most people use and what drives market sentiment the vast majority of the time.

Trading patterns are bullshit though. Every time I read them they're made up horoscope crap and there's so many patterns that you can basically ascribe any pattern to any event."

You don’t need overly complicated TA to make some pretty educated guesses and help to facilitate a solid game plan. It is equally important along with the other tools available and anyone who doubts it is missing out in my opinion. And trying to talk about GME and TA is just stupid. GME is an outlier and no TA can predict that range of outcomes.

The problem is, if you don't know shit about TA or how it works, you can't tell the difference between someone who knows what they're talking about and someone who does not. When you do know how it works, it's easy to spot someone using it incorrectly.

03/13/2021,stocks,"This is terrible advice. TA alone has literally been proven to be the equivalent of a coin flip. When combined with FA it can be beneficial and give you a broader picture, but claiming that your day trading success is because of TA is inaccurate, you’re just getting lucky if that’s all you’re relying on"
03/13/2021,stocks,"Right. It's like sabermetrics in baseball and analytics in basketball. It identifies opportunities that are currently undervalued, and provides statistical probabilities of something going one way or another. It's not an exact science, but as long as one weighs reward to risk, and practice proper position sizing, one can win more than lose."
03/13/2021,stocks,"It’s bringing order to randomness. One method may work for Bob to pull 7 figure income, but Joe tries it exactly and loses his shirt.  

It’s not a precise science. There’s wisdoms that are required as well to understand the charts, and many can’t fully explain it or codify the theories into an exact science. Just like with any highly specialized and lucrative scientific trade- you can’t just put a recipe on it and make millions. While AI/ML have come a long way, there’s still plenty of aspects of things that seem like they’re systematic at a high level there are plenty of little nuances that happen in one’s mind that are hard as hell to explain.  

So TA is bullshit if you read about a strategy on a stock from someone and tries to apply it exactly to a stock of your choice without understanding all of the nuances with wisdom around it. And don’t forget, most of these people doing YouTube trades and such have already done it and won’t be hurt by telling people a trade they already performed. If anything, it’s borderline pump and dump. 

But for those who find success, it’s A tool in their strategies. I’m still very much in the knowledge level of following trends and what analysts say, and it’s decent to keep up with the market. And what I’m finding from those who understand charts very well is they can consistently identify what the market is about to do - but rarely clearly explain exactly why they are highlighting certain indicators and price actions. 

Mind you, the reason someone doesn’t look at it, know what’s going to happen, then bet the house is it’s not a 100% guarantee. Plus, the larger your trade, the more likely you’ll bring unwanted attention and negatively impact things. 

Plenty more to learn, but I can at least see it’s possible and will take a long time, persistence, and mistakes before I can rely on my wisdom to do this confidently."

03/13/2021,stocks,Care to go into why reading TA indicators gives you a defined statistical edge? Options trading gives you one because you sell OTM options 1 or 2 standard deviation away from ITM probability which results in a 63-95% likelihood of success. This is mathematically proven and verifiable. I’m curious how you can prove that TA gives you a statistical edge because to be quite honest I don’t believe it does. Or at the very least I don’t believe it’s measurable and provable.
03/13/2021,stocks,"Also technical analysis isnt something you can get right away, it’s a skill.  You have to study the technical to understand the psychology of why patterns even exist.  Its not something you can pick up over night, you have to really be looking at charts, and work on it. 

And because patterns are actually human psychology within the chart, nothing is guaranteed 100% but the odds are in your favor with enough information.

Those that say if TA was real, most will be a billionaire.  No, you need big capital first, but with TA my returns are many times more than the S&P and i believe everyone who is well verses in TA all will have a higher average return than anyone commenting here against it. And thats the point.  

Good TA defines your entry point, your risk, and your profit levels.  TA is playing probabilities in your favor.

You wont be a billionaire with amazing TA but your returns will be higher on average."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Yep. TA is the way. Reddit thinks it’s a bag of shit indicators and candle patterns. But no it’s mostly horizontal levels of support and resistance lol. It’s not a sure thing nothing is, but if you know what the fuck you’re doing you’re going to have a very high probability of your plans working out"
03/13/2021,stocks,But the only reason any of these things have any predictive power at all is that so many people think they do.  If we could convince everyone that resistance is actually random and never means anything then it would instantly stop working.
03/13/2021,stocks,Yup. All stock prices oscillate at least once or twice a year and RSI helps with timing entrance and exit.
03/13/2021,stocks,"KDJ and RSI on a volatile stock really help see entry/exit points for swing/day trading. I don’t make decisions based on the TA, but rather to help time my moves for maximum profit/minimum risk.

There is a betting strategy, if you aren't familiar, known as the Martingale betting strategy that involves betting on a game that has as close to a 50/50 probability of winning as possible, the easiest is a roulette table which has about a 48/52 ratio. 

In short, you bet $1 on red, and if you lose, you bet $2. If you lose that, you bet $4, then $8, $16, etc.. until you eventually win and make $1 back. The chance of losing goes up exponentially by a factor of 48/100, or .48, each time and to put into perspective reaches a 99.94% chance of success after 10 consecutive losses ($512 total wager). The downfall to this strategy is that eventually the law of averages says eventually you will fall within that .06% range and lose all your money if you do not have enough capital to double down every time, but it's fun in theory nonetheless."
03/13/2021,stocks,"I'll admit I'm a skeptic by nature and my distaste for it more than likely stems from that. From what I've seen, TA is clearly the most monetized aspect of ""stock market courses"" and it all comes across as very disingenuous and a big scam. People new to the stock market love TA because once they start to learn it they think they've cracked the code of the stock market and are now capable of predicting movement and making decisions but in reality it's just fake confidence and holds no real value. All I have to do is look at any of these stock market youtube channels and see that 99% of them focus on technical analysis because that's what gives people confidence in someone which leads to support, donations, etc. and that's what reassures me that it's overplayed to get people to buy into them. Do you really think someone who claims to understand TA and is able to use it to effectively make money would spend their time making youtube videos on it? Why the fuck wouldn't they just employ and keep it to themselves? It's because it's extremely easily monetizable and can easily manipulate an audience.

I am having a hard time articulating it, but being a data science grad, I can tell you that these are the type of statistics that do more harm than good and at the end of the day are nothing more than misguided self fulfilling prophecies and coin flips."

But seriously though, this.  I don't day trade, so maybe TA is more useful there, but I only look at it at the earnings-report level.  Earnings report getting priced in?  Either average up a little now or wait till after.  That's pretty much it for me.  Company plans, crew and current and recent financials are what matter most to me, and I think that's reasonable for anyone in stocks longer than a month."
03/13/2021,stocks,OP probably lost money after watching a click bait video about MACD crossovers or some shit so now all TA is voodoo
03/13/2021,stocks,"Because stocks are being traded freely based on supply and demand. Technical analysis in essence is a collection of techniques that aim to capture information about it.

03/13/2021,stocks,"I physically cringe anytime I see “DD” that involves greek variables and every time I do see one, I instantly discredit the entire post. There have been many studies that prove the natural randomness of options overshadows any decisions using greek variables that could be made and your chance of predicting an options movement off of greek variables is basically that of a coin flip. Fundamental analysis, news and the current trend and sentiment of the market are infinitely more important for predicting an options immediate movement than greek variables could ever be."

That's fine, but to claim the other tools are bullshit because you don't understand them or use them is indicative of your ignorance on the topic and not the other way around. 

Does a 30 delta weekly csp guarantee what's going to happen or just give you an indication of what may happen based on certain variables? That's TA in a nutshell. You may care about delta and not gamma or theta, but they exist and are useful in the right hands. 

Patterns appear in nature at a regular occurrence. To assert otherwise is ignorant to the world we live in. Patterns do not guarantee a future outcome, but they do give you an idea of what to expect, or what to do if xyz change occurs. 

I don't trade on TA but it's ridiculous to say that overall market patterns don't exist."

03/13/2021,stocks,"No need to argue with me. You still have to do cursory DD on stocks you swing or day trade as the chart will not tell you if an S3 is filed and there's not enough cash to last the year, if there's significant risk of bad news dropping on the same day you're daytrading it (patent ruling for some biotech for example). Or CEO just gets nailed for fraud on the exact day of breakout and people are pumping it.

Why do you rip on them for never saying something with conviction, you can't say the market can't be predicted, and rip them for not having full conviction something will happen. That's just contradicting your own argument.

As someone who watches Trey a lot to get updates on AMC and such, I can say that while, like all info, it's not 100% or even 70%, it does help people understand better what to look for.

Personally I've become much better at predicting when to buy in or sell, and that has due to understanding patterns etc.

At the end of the day, every bit of info can help you make better choices. All those small advantages can help you trade better.

You decide what info is helpful to you, I don't really care too much about chart info either in these videos, I mean I understand much better what happens, but when I want to make a move I check the charts right there and then.

It really isn't though, as I said in that overused casino analogy, no tool (aside from market manipulation) can provide certainty in the stock market...
The reason it is incomparable to the roullete example you've given is that roullete is not affected by market opinion. 

Basically, the more people basing their purchasing decisions on TA, the more effective it becomes in predicting the market.

In the same way you'd listen to a new figure published by a bank or a corporation, that ends up swaying the market to mass purchasing/selling of a stock...
TA can provide a hint toward mass decision making in the market..."

but i have to admit, the strongest case for why TA is actually real in some sense was already said in this thread. Its collective trader psychology. TA is so widespread that when a stock price hits a certain support level, so many other people will believe that it ""should rise"" that they buy, so the stock rises. and it becomes true for no other reason than people willing it into being basically. And the same for resistance levels and shorts.

TA is one of the coolest actual real world manifestations of self fulfilling prophecy I've ever seen"

TA helps understand what the probabilities are in order to make better educated guesses, because in the end, nobody can tell you with 100% assurance that they known where, when and how high/low it'll go.

Are you going to win every time? Of course not. But you give yourself consistent outcomes and consistent statistical chances of success.

If you are just buying OTM calls for no reason other than thinking the stock will go up then yes you are gambling. There are proper and improper ways to trade options."
03/13/2021,stocks,"https://youtu.be/7PM4rNDr4oI This is the guide I watched to start understanding options. It’s long but extremely valuable and if you have any desire whatsoever to trade options you will watch it in its entirety. 

He doesn’t go into option greeks but he and many others have videos explaining them. Basically they are statistical variables that are derived from the options bid/ask pressure, strike price and days til expiration that indicate how likely the stock is to move, how much its value will decay over time and how much the option price will change. 

The only way to consistently make profit is to have a statistically probable chance of winning. What profitable option traders do resembles that of a casino. If you have a statistical edge, be it as small as even 1%, and you create enough observations, or in this case trades, you will always profit. In essence statistically probable options trading involves selling calls and puts that have a low chance of expiring in the money so that they expire worthless and you collect premium for free. The mistake 90% of traders make is that they want to just get rich quick and without a diligent and consistent work ethic. Low risk, low reward is how you play the stock market. This is the basic idea but it is up to you to research as much as you can from here."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Just put aside $50-$100 for call options. Try and sell them for profit, but always before expiry, unless you plan to exercise them (buy the 100 shares per contract).

Probably beginners luck, but I bought an $AMC 12c 12Mar at .30 monday and sold it Wednesday before the short attack for .78, making around %160 return on my $30 investment.

Now I'm gonna use my $78 to find another slightly OTM call I think will be easily profitable, like a 13c 19 Mar for AMC. I'll build my options trading like that, rather than YOLOing my life saving on something. I'd much rather play with $30 and house money for my learning fee."

03/13/2021,stocks,"No, but can you with your TA? At least I can tell you that it would be likely to follow the sentiment of the market as a whole. If for example the treasury yield goes up, then it's likely the market goes down including Zillow. TA couldn't tell you shit."
03/13/2021,stocks,"That would be true if TA pointed towards one prediction and all TA'ers followed that, but that isn't the case. Many (conflicting) predictions are put forward by it, thus largely having no impact on the market. 

To use the overused casino analogy again, it's as if black came up 10 times in a row. One person believes black must come up an 11th time to keep the streak going, while another believes that the law of averages has to kick at some point and surely red will have its turn now. Both are wrong. 

I'm doubling down on TA being an extension of gambler's fallacy."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Support and resistance levels are also valuable before they are based on previous information, and sometimes, trades that have yet to be executed. Level 2 data is also extremely important here, depending on if algos are trading it or not. In a lot of cheaper stocks, you can trust the L2 data because pennies are mostly retail traders.

For instance, if someone on Robinhood puts in a limit order to sell X stock at Y price, I can see that in real time. They might have put that limit in today (not actually today, it's Saturday) and it will get canceled at the end of the trading day. Or, it can be good for 90 days. One can look at the previous supports and resistances and see X is trending up recently and it's about to test some level of resistance again.

If that L2 data from random RH user (and 15k other people) are all selling at Y price, I can make a few educational guesses about where a breakout will be, what to buy at and when to cut losses. Maybe the price hasn't risen to that point yet and so we still have thousands of orders that have yet to be executed, but that data has been there for awhile. So we're not always playing off trader psychology. Many times, it's using the public data available to make informed choices. I don't *think* people are going to buy or sell, at certain levels, I *know* it. Of course there are plenty of buys/sells that we don't know about ahead of time as well.

I think people don't trust TA because it can be overwhelming and they don't really understand it. Of course, only using TA without trying to analyze news, markets trends, fundamentals, etc. is also silly. A stock can have a great looking chart but if bad news comes out or SPY tanks, then it's probably going down."
03/13/2021,stocks,">Resistances aren’t random though, they are buy/sell blocks managed by the big money algorithms.

03/13/2021,stocks,"Yes. I've known it's bullshit for decades. There are no rich people who owe it all to TA. For traders it is a source of false confidence, and for con men it is a source of small marks."
03/13/2021,stocks,"It's not a secret that the market has an observable trend at any given moment. There are green days, red days and quiet, sideways days. When you sell an option, the majority of your profit comes from overvaluation based off of high volatility. When the market goes up, volatility makes the price of call options go up, so you sell them and make money if the market goes up, slightly down or sideways. If the market is in a red day, the value of puts goes up based on volatility and you sell them in the same fashion. The best case scenario is in a sideways moving market with high volatility which overvalues calls and puts simultaneously and you sell both and make money whichever way the market goes. Volatility is measured by the VIX index and the statistical probability of success is measured by option greeks and ITM probability. ITM probability is a measurement of the stock's historical movement and how likely it is to become ITM within the option's lifetime. One standard deviation encompasses 63% of the stock's movement and two standard deviations is 95%. 

If you sell a put option at a 29 strike on a $40 underlying that has two standard deviation range between 30-50, this means there is a 95% chance the underlying will not go below $30 and the put you sold will expire worthless and you collect free premium. This is the basic idea of selling options. Obviously the premium you obtain for selling something so far OTM will be miniscule, but you can leverage down your chance of success for more money as much as you feel comfortable. 

Most people care about whether or not the market is moving up or down because they buy stocks and the only way to profit off of stocks is to hold them until they go up. When you sell options, all you care about is knowing which way the market is heading to capitalize off of volatility and using that to sell overpriced options that will statistically net you profit over 51% of the time. I would be happy to go into more detail however I am unsure if you have already dismissed what I am telling you but if you are interested I suggest you look up Tastytrade and Tom Sosnoff and the many resources they have that explain this strategy."

Your comment: yeah it's complete bullshit except for the kind that *I use*"
03/13/2021,stocks,"So is alpha, beta, sharpe and r-squared.  Not all technical indicators are memes, that is my point."
03/13/2021,stocks,Oooops
03/13/2021,stocks,"People in this thread have no idea what technical indicators are. That’s why you’re being downvoted. Technical indicators have fallen so far out of favor that most novice traders these days have never even heard of them. I am debating with someone right now who insists that “beta” and “sharpe ratio” are technical indicators.  

I view their ignorance of them as a sign that you’re correct - if technicals were statistically relevant then these newbies would know what they were. 

My own thought is that technicals became irrelevant around 2010 when we saw big increases in HFT algos."

03/13/2021,stocks,"> You have absolutely no idea how to properly trade options if you think it is even remotely close to gambling.

Hey that's what day traders say about stocks! And technical analysts say about TA!  

Also it was you who literally used the word ""casino"" to describe it when talking about win ratio. It is gambling and now you're delusional. At least bring some modicum of self awareness to the table."
03/13/2021,stocks,"*The only way to consistently make profit is to have a statistically probable chance of winning. What profitable option traders do resembles that of a casino. If you have a statistical edge, be it as small as even 1%, and you create enough observations, or in this case trades, you will always profit.*

That same premise can be applied to technical analysis. It's unreal how you can rationalize your own bullshit while simultaneously ridiculing something that is founded on the same principle. 

Absolutely hilarious, genuinely mind-boggling. 

Look at the pot calling the kettle black.

Just delete this post lol."
03/13/2021,stocks,"> What profitable option traders do resembles that of a casino

Yep ok there it is. You're at least aware it's literally gambling but then continue to self rationalize you somehow have a ""statistical chance"" of winning. Bruh"
03/13/2021,stocks,This guy does options only and uses ta such as Greeks and then says all Ta is bullshit. What shit is this?
03/13/2021,stocks,"For a week you definitely need to be aware of more than the chart. Tons of daytraders or short term swingers get unnecessarily unlucky trying to hold a stock for just a few hours or two days. 

No one trading for any length of time hasn't seen it in abundance every year."
03/13/2021,stocks,So because those two firms don't use TA no successful firms use TA?
03/13/2021,stocks,This
03/13/2021,stocks,"Then the question of what is „relative value” remains and if someone thinks that such a thing exist :)
I’m rather for Benjamin Grahams approach to the valuation, so fundamental analysis. 
Believing that past behaviours of the stock value determine its future behaviour seems too naive for me."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Which is another factor I guess- you’re buying into pump and dump schemes for them. They’re going to exit when they get enough of you in. 

Basically, if you’re watching YouTube traders AND you’re buying what they suggest, you ARE their strategy. They’re making money off your ads and then making money off of pumping their position up. It doesn’t matter what their actual BS strategy is they’re telling you as long as they get you to believe it’ll work to pump up their position."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Alright, let's use a very simple ""low-hanging-fruit"" example to prove that TA can have added probabilistic value in public opinion, once we've done that, we can try to figure out where are its limits:

Say you have a bearish market that is nearing a strong support line, the stock/FX pair seems oversold and that same support line happens to be a whole number, say 1.5000
Looking at these three signals, you can project that a reversal might occur in the next few candles.
So you set it up and wait for a confirmation, if and when you get that confirmation, you along with any other guy that followed the same TA logic are likely to enter the trade and jack up the price (thus fulfilling your initial projection).

Getting that signal-combo doesn't confirm your guaranteed future earnings, but if you only took trades with those 3 signals lined up and with correct risk-reward ratios you would be profitable over time.
Not because these are clear rules about the market, but because these are clear rules about the trading community's consensus on TA.
If the vast majority of traders believed that 10 consecutive bearish candles are a great signifier of another 10 bearish candles coming, then that would start occuring more in the market.

To try and jam the same concept in different terms:
Comparing a roullete round to a market decision based on TA is false. It is false because a roullete round has defined probabilities. If you played 100 rounds, each one would have the same defined probability regardless of the last round's outcome.
If the above TA example holds true, and I believe it does, then TA can affect the probability and make a scenario less or more probable, making every decision round unequal to its predecessor.

There is a lot of room to debate how effective TA actually is, but to flat out reject it because it is not deterministic is just bad trading."
03/13/2021,stocks,"that's awesome, unfortunately I don't actually understand how to read level 2 data. I've watched some courses on order book order flow or whatever and it looks just insanely complex and hard to follow when there are a lot of orders coming through. I'm sure it's useful if you can ""unlock"" understanding it."
03/13/2021,stocks,"You can see them in the order book, I've been following this penny stock and it got up to 1.00 and from 1.01-1.10 there were 400k+ asks to 22k bids at 1.00. Sounds like resistance to me."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Log a record of back trading using validating indicators and find strategies that are profitable.

03/13/2021,stocks,"It depends on what you define as “using TA”. I can read a primer on TA start doing it, but I’ll probably lose money, because you can’t learn this in a day. It takes lots of experience. 

Stockjock to me is the proof that it is POSSIBLE to make consistent gains using TA, i.e. that TA is profitable if applied correctly. Maybe not the scientific “proof” you are looking for since n=1, but proof for me nonetheless."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Nah dude it really is. This is just not with economics, its with everything in our lives. We convince ourselves of things to keep us sane. Economic policies is no different than a religion doctrine. Tell me, since you’re such an expert, what happens to stock market if suddenly NASA announces there is an astroid heading straight to Earth with 90% chance of hitting and 100% chance of loss of all life?

03/13/2021,stocks,"It’s quite sad how people cant differentiate ITM probability from “support and resistance price levels”. One is a mathematical measurement that takes into account HISTORIC price movement, volatility, standard deviation and many other calculations to give a probability on the stock entering a specific range in a specific period of time and the other is someone eyeball guessing where the stock might bounce off of. Whatever. If people want to keep fooling themselves and don’t want to sincerely learn how to properly trade options using math and probability then that’s up to them."

03/13/2021,stocks,"So you need to understand who pump and dump, and who don't.

Again if you own a stock and talk about it and more buy in, that's good for you, but as long as they are not about the pump and dump, it can be good for you as well. 

As retail investors we are always lagging behind, it's that simple, there are always people closer to a source who will get tipped of quicker. 
What a good youtuber does, is get info from many sources, find the hidden gems and do good research on them. 
There is nothing wrong with getting in like 1 or 2% higher then they do, by watching a 10 minute video. 

Now whether you should trust that research is another thing, regardless of their intent, they can miss stuff, or make a bad analysis, but imo finding people who do good research, regardless of whether it's through videos, reddit posts or articles, helps you do your own research faster, and find good investments. 

At the end of the day, you should never rely on 1 source, even if the source is to be trusted, you should always check around yourself."
03/13/2021,stocks,Thanks for lengthy explanation. You're clearly more experienced than myself. I take most of my opinion on TA from some friends who work for professional trading firms and they don't use it at all.
03/13/2021,stocks,"Id like to sometime i just dont find any good indicators on their own. Some give u small information to add everything up but you just have to look at the market for what it is, a randomized buying and selling of securities based on value, popularity and being able to separate small money from big money and what the actions and movement mean. But its mostly random based on the buying and selling of millions of people around the world but sometimes you can see what algos are doing too. I dont put a blanket idea or indicator on anything lots of stocks are different and move different as well"
03/13/2021,stocks,"Smarter people then me chose the variables for that research so i will differ to their judgement on that. I can understand its proof for you, bu that doesn’t mean its “proof” in general your post seemed to imply that."

03/13/2021,stocks,"Not all TA is sans math (indicators, for example). And even just for the Microsoft paint stuff, there have been a couple major studies that have found that buying/selling TA patterns beat the market before commissions, but not after. Now that commissions are gone, using MS Paint might slightly outperform SPY. However, past performance isn't indicative of future performance, and those studies that looked at this are old and used old data."
03/13/2021,stocks,Apparently people can’t understand this concept.
03/13/2021,stocks,"Uh... yeah they are, by the literal definition of a technical indicator 

> In technical analysis in finance, a technical indicator is a mathematical calculation based on historic price, volume, or open interest information that aims to forecast financial market direction."
03/13/2021,stocks,"The idea behind support and resistance is that it's market psychology, which I find plausible from price levels over a long period of time (much more than a day). For example, say I hesitated to invest in GameStop when it was $40 or so, which it idled at before its huge run-up. Then that whole time it was shooting up, I would have kicked myself for not investing sooner, saying ""I would definitely invest in it if it hit that level again."" Then after it came back down, everyone that wanted to have gotten in at that price range does, establishing $40 as its support. Resistance works the opposite if a stock tanks and a lot of people got in around a price that the stock had sat for awhile. The key is that the stock has to sit at a price for awhile to make people have regret from either not buying and watching it rise or from buying and watching it fall.

That being said, I never draw support or resistance lines and don't think they're of much value. But I understand the concept and think it's a real thing.

Edit: fwiw I am well versed in probability and use it extensively in selling options. I just don't discount people's collective emotional trading."

03/13/2021,stocks,"If I could give you any suggestion on indicators, because I agree that they aren’t going to produce set-in-stone results, I would recommend bolinger bands and RSI.

If you turn on the bands with their default values, you’ll notice any time the price dips below the bottom band, and is oversold (<30 on RSI), I’d bet my left nut it’ll rebound back up. It’s a great way to apply short-term timing to your entries.

The same can be said when the candle shoots above the top band and RSI is above 70, it’s guaranteed to dip back down from profit taking.

That principle alone, I can assure you, will yield noticeable results. I completely agree though that there are so many other variables that act is indicators of their own, so no one can rely purely on TA"
03/13/2021,stocks,"No. Those are retroactive measurements meant to assess past performance and risk and are not meant to be used to indicate future returns. They are evaluative measurements, not indicative measurements.

Technical indicators are meant to be used to indicate future returns."
03/13/2021,stocks,"You're just wrong. And that's ok. If everyone was right then there would be no wrong people to make money off of.

When you sell a put option on an underlying that is at $40, there is a variable called ""ITM probability"" that uses historical data to indicate the likelihood of it moving outside of a certain range. One standard deviation equates to 63% of all possible movement, and two standard deviations equates to 95%. If you sell a 29 put option on a $40 stock that has a 2 standard deviation range of $30-$50, or in other words an ITM probability of <5%, there is a 95% chance that the stock will remain within that range up until the option's expiration. There are obviously numerous more variables, metrics and calculations that go into making these decisions but this is the basic idea. I don't know why I'm sitting here trying to give away the secret to making money but it pisses me off that people think they can actually win by staring at a chart and pressing buy at the correct time. But whatever, I don't give a shit anymore. 

Btw, Webull and Robinhood don't charge commission.

Also, do you think the model casinos use to make money is a secret? It's out in plain daylight. They have a statistical probability of winning over you. That's all. That's all you have to do to be consistently profitable in the stock market. There is no secret to it."
03/13/2021,stocks,"No one ever got laid buying VTI, that’s what I always say"
03/13/2021,stocks,"Fair enough. I think you’re saying you don’t know? 

You can make money from lots of things that are considered gambling. The obvious one is poker but it also applies to things where you can (legally) get an edge through things like card counting.

People winning using these techniques are typically using “statistics”. That give them “a statistical chance of winning”"
03/13/2021,stocks,"I dont really like either of those indicators, I get RSI can tell you decent entry points but that should be obvious looking at a chart too and probably better off just watching the chart instead of RSI. Prices can keep dropping even if short term RSI is 20-30 and keep dropping while RSI levels level off and go back towards 50. Same on the way up if you always sell when RSI hits 70 you are missing out on some major gains in short term or long term future most likely. Ive seen plenty of stocks just keep blowing past 70 RSI and stay up high. Bollinger bands may be useful if you are daytrading if you need something to tell you when a price is higher than avg or lower than avg but only useful in a certain subset of trading and even then they arent giving you that much info just a high and low range compared to moving average. Anyway i used to use indicators like these and many more but my % return is way better in the months since ive stopped even looking at ANY of them. I think im up like 1600% just this year but last year I was up around 800% for the whole year, and most of that was probably after i stopped looking at those indicators in my noobier days"
03/13/2021,stocks,"I think one the best ""indicators"" is knowing a stocks price range, why its there, P/E ratio, upcoming future of the company, stuff like outstanding shares and float, volume, short volumes, knowing whether the stock is on a pump or a down quiet period, checking trends, knowing which type of volume is coming in and what type of people are buying in, stuff like that is most important #1. These are the types of things big money looks at, no hedge fund person or someone liek Cathie Woods is sitting there looking at RSI and MA and bollinger bands and crap."
03/13/2021,stocks,"I just used the formal definition to prove that they are, in fact, technical indicators.  All technical indicators merely assess past performance as you can’t assess future data that doesn’t exist yet."
03/13/2021,stocks,"It’s super nice of you to leave some money in the market for the rest of us. Usually, someone with a guaranteed winning strategy like yours would just max it out and become a multi-billionaire. 

There are so many problems with your assumptions. The first and most glaring being that historical data doesn’t guarantee anything. You can NOT look at the history of a stock and deduct whether it will go up or down in the future. 

The next on, and a lot more important, is that all of your genius calculations are already priced into whatever you’re buying. In an age of trading algorithms, there is no arbitrage that a retail trader might find. 

My guess on why you’re so cocky is that you’re probably making a continuous profit with your strategy, one that might even beat the market, but what you’re probably not factoring in is the risk you’re taking on."
03/13/2021,stocks,[deleted]

03/13/2021,stocks,"> My guess on why you’re so cocky is that you’re probably making a continuous profit with your strategy, one that might even beat the market

You got it my friend. Nobody employing this strategy is a billionaire because it's not a high risk high reward strategy that will net you billions. It is low risk, low reward. That is the key. 

Listen to what you are saying; if by you saying I am losing money and taking on a lot of risk by selling options, you are effectively saying the person buying my options is making money and taking on less risk than I am. Do you really think the person buying a $130 AAPL call expiring next Friday has a higher chance of making money than I do selling it? A trade is a transaction between two people. One has to have a higher probability of success than the other and in the case of options and theta decay, it is almost always in favor of the seller. But like I said, I'm not going to sit here and try to convince a stranger that isn't even giving what I am saying an honest thought why it is a profitable strategy. Go ahead and continue to use your dildo convergences to trade stocks."
03/13/2021,stocks,"No dude. It depends what you mean by gambling. Your original post implies that gambling is an invalid approach to generating money. So it’s pretty important what you think gambling means. From your later posts I can see you are including games like poker in your list. This means you are wrong. The fact that it “is played in a casino” doesn’t make it any less viable.

Blast fishing is very different. For one it’s illegal. Two it’s destroys the environment. However, let’s say for arguments sake it was LEGAL and it DIDN’T harm the environment. Then if your job was to catch a lot of fish - blast fishing would definitely be a viable technique."
03/13/2021,stocks,I do understand the formal definition.  You are simply picking an arbitrary line to distinguish one type of indicator from another.
03/13/2021,stocks,oops
03/13/2021,stocks,"Based purely on the data you’re using, you and the guy buying your call will have the same expected return. That is my whole point. The odds are not in anyone’s favor. You are not in the position of the casino. And whether it’s commission or spread (market makers don’t work for free, which you also didn’t consider), you’ll always be slightly below the perfect 50/50. 

Would you rather have $50 outright, or flip a coin ten times, for the chance to get $9.99 each time it lands on heads? What you’re doing with your strategy is taking the second option. I’d do the same, but that’s gambling."
03/13/2021,stocks,"No. I’m picking the actual line. You just don’t understand what it is because you’re uneducated about this. 

As I explained: alpha, beta, sharpe ratio, etc are all analytical measurements meant to evaluate past performance. They are not meant to indicate future returns and are therefore not technical indicators. 

Technical indicators are analyzing past data for information on future returns. Bollinger bands, relative strength index, macd, etc. You don’t look at those and go “hey, the stock just passed it’s 60 day moving average, guess that means the PM is efficient and added value!” That would be ridiculous. Instead, it’s meant as an indicator that the stock might move.

You’d also sound ridiculous if you said something like “The stock’s sharpe ratio just reached it’s all time high - that means it’s about break out of its pattern and dip by 5%”. .. Because sharpe ratio is a performance measurement.  And furthermore, the “indicators” you mentioned are meant for evaluating portfolios, not individual stocks, whereas technical indicators are meant for individual stocks.

Your stubbornness to admit you’re wrong is bothering me. It would take you all of ten seconds to pull up a list of technical indicators and verify that I’m right. If you keep reposting that definition that you don’t understand then I’ll assume you’re a clever troll, in which case, well played.

Here, I’ll help. This is a list of over 100 technical indicators. You know what isn’t on this list? Not a single one of your examples.

03/13/2021,stocks,"I’m not wrong and beta, for instance, is most certainly a technical indicator.

03/13/2021,stocks,"Your description of the strategy and the odds around them made it absolutely clear that you have no idea what you’re talking about. 

You’re right that I just got into actually trading options, but what you won’t get from my history is that I do in fact have demonstrable knowledge about the topic, in the form of a degree in economics with a specialization in finance. 

So unlike you, I’ve actually spent more than a few hours researching the topics we’re talking about. Unless you have discovered something that none of my professors know about, there is no strategy (based on publicly known data) that will somehow put the odds of the market in your favor. That is such a fundamental basis of the whole thing that it’s really baffling how hard you’ve convinced yourself of the opposite."

I have quite a few 60+ DTE options and a few leaps and wasn't sure if I should close some positions and hold onto the cash or just let them be. Thanks"
03/13/2021,stocks,i would do nothing different.  WSB went nuts over a quad during the pandemic early last year and nothing happened.

Quad witching can bring some volatility into the market but nothing crazy usually. If you ask me, we just experience our quad witching volatility these past 2-3 weeks. Seems like the institutions repositioned their portfolios early to get situated in advance and rotated some capital, drove tech down by selling off bonds (driving interest rates up) to scoop tech up at bargain basement prices, and tried to force the feds hand, but what do I know.

If it gets ugly volatility increases, but it doesn't last long.  That last sentence has lots of clues for how to play the typical volatility movements even if they are minimal this round.  Things have been pretty calm for a few days and even yesterday."
03/13/2021,stocks,With 10year yield over 1.6% and recent Nasdaq volatility could make Friday a very volatile day.

03/13/2021,stocks,"Curious why this would not just be one the countless other events that’s “priced in” especially since we’ve all known about it for like 50 years. Is it just because it’s bad news, potentially?"
03/13/2021,stocks,Tesla should go up a bit I suspect as my understanding is Hedgies havnt fully brought enough shares to make alpha since TSLA got included in S&P500. Ark will probably have to sell some tho as they are above 10% in some of their funds
03/13/2021,stocks,Sell everything!!!!!!
03/13/2021,stocks,I do remember losing a lot of money during this though lol went for a walk and got home at 9:30 to see my portfolio open down 6%
03/13/2021,stocks,"100% that it goes up or down, and 50% it stays flat!"
03/13/2021,stocks,Tesla about to double their best Q1 earnings and this guy calling it a bubble stock. Save this post and hit me up at 4th of April
03/13/2021,stocks,https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/quadruplewitching.asp
03/13/2021,stocks,You’re clueless. Do you even know what the source of TSLA’s earnings has been recently? TSLA market cap exceeds the combined market cap of all the other auto makers but it has less than 1% of global market share. Bubble confirmed.
03/13/2021,stocks,[deleted]
03/13/2021,stocks,"Lol. You are not a numbers person are you? Probably never read their 10-K much less understood it. Their earnings have been the result of selling carbon emissions tax credits. This is not a source of sustainable recurring cash flow. Bubble stock gamblers like you are in for a bad lesson, sooner than you think."
2021-03-13 06:25:11,stocks,"VA, MA and MSFT over the past 10 years........ Does it get any better?!?!?! Visa and Mastercard over the past ten years have averaged annual returns during this time of 30%+ They have had about 16-19 down months from the previous month in terms of share price since Feb 2012. And yes, a few of those were covid related. The only other comparable stock that is even remotely close is MSFT. They also had under 18 months of share price being lower from the previous month over the last TEN YEARS. Guys and gals, please build a portfolio of V, MA and MSFT. These three stocks are best and class but a mile. And no, Google, Apple, and others from my research are not as consistent over the last TEN YEARS or have 27%+ average annual returns. Does anyone know of any stock remotely close in terms of consistency AND returns?

V average annual returns: 30.6%

MA average annual return 32.6%

MSFT average annual return 27.6%"

03/13/2021,stocks,I hear you. Can you help me understand how Apple Pay negatively effects them? My Apple Pay is linked to my visa so they still get their % transactional fees. Same with my google pay.
03/13/2021,stocks,Don’t sleep on MA!
03/13/2021,stocks,"Plenty of people are fans of these companies, including me. The issues are 1) oversimplification of the described methodology and 2) the statement that the described dynamics of these companies are unique among stocks. 

There are ample stocks with similar returns over the same period, and possibly other examples if you shift the period. You’d have to perform a holistic screen using a variety of metrics to even attempt this analysis - not chart stocks one at a time. 

Period chosen is arbitrary and by no means a benchmark. Both MA and V had IPO’s 2006-2008, so that alone calls into question what comparable period makes sense to use in context with other companies’ performance.

Superlative assertions are made about volatility with no discussion of standard deviation. Superlative assertions are made about risk adjusted returns with no mention of Sharpe ratios. And then rather ironically, people who are accused of being rookies are directed to go look at charts, which is like the beginner version of analytics (technical analysis aside, but that is not what was described here).

So no, this is not about disagreeing that these are “good” stocks to own. It’s about a lack of substantive analysis and an overly narrow conclusion that doesn’t hold up.

And I mean no offense personally to the OP or anyone else. Just giving my opinion after I tried not to, but was subsequently and baselessly lumped into a group of clueless haters."
03/13/2021,stocks,Rookies. That’s what’s up with the hate. They rather put their money in Tesla and ARKK than actual good investments.
2021-03-13 06:17:32,stocks,"Thoughts on MGM? What does everyone make of this MGM Buffalo Wild Wings partnership?  I know they have bumped recently but how much further do you think this could raise the stock price?  Seems like other gaming stocks have been doing well with online sport betting and this MGM deal seems like some good news.

I'm in at around $15 so it's all a win from here, but it would be nice to see it hit $50."

03/13/2021,stocks,"I had MGM and sold for Draftkings. 

I think MGM could be a good long term play as casinos and gambling arent going anywhere. However if you are looking for a moon shot idk if its MGM. But i think itll give some nice steady growth as we transition to opening the country and travel. I know im itching to go to vegas. 

My goals to hold DraftKings till she feels tapped out or till i make back my initial cost to buy. We will see what happens.

Another big play is PENN as they are being listed on the nasdaq this month. However they just had a huge run so idk if its a good buy or how itll effect it long term"
03/13/2021,stocks,I got into MGM around $15 as well.  I think that it is gonna make it to $50 too as reopening takes it's course.  I wish I had more money to dump into it back in March when I bought into this gold mine.  But I imagine unless they really take more market share it will settle back down a couple quarters after reopening happens more.
03/13/2021,stocks,"Bought MGM shares when it went down to $8. I also bought a $42 call as well. Like all travel/resorts, MGM might go up as vaccinations continue and more people will travel. Last year, MGM slowly grew back to $28-$29 where it was before the crash. MGM is more focused with “BetMGM"" sports betting to compete with Draftkings and Fanduel. With the new Buffalo partnership, I think it will help MGM go up a bit. They are also planning on adding a Buffalo’s Wild Wings inside MGM Grand.

MGM is a good stock to own for mid-long term. They got the huge jump from $28-$38 due to the newly renovated rooms at the Bellagio. They also completed updating half of their properties with the “Stay Well” rooms options similar to MGM Grand “Stay Well” rooms. MGM re-opened three of their properties with 24/7 hours service and opened their pools. 

When I visit Vegas, I always stay at a MGM property. Ceaser’s properties feels cheap as they don’t have the same safety measures as Wynn or MGM"
03/13/2021,stocks,"I think are better growth opportunities out there than casino stocks in general.  It’s not a high growth model at all.  It relies on huge capital costs and a consistently good economy. 

No one needs casinos."
03/13/2021,stocks,Yeah I am hesitant to jump into PENN because of how much it has shot up. I kick myself for not buying it back when it was under $10.
03/13/2021,stocks,I bailed on MGM for Sands LVS. Sands selling Vegas properties seems like a good move. I think Vegas will be slow to return with more states legalizing sports betting and even online casinos. The convention business was really big for Vegas and conventions will be awhile to return. But I’m not completely confident with LVS. Their next move with that $6B will be crucial
03/13/2021,stocks,It will be interesting to see what this current deal does for them.
03/13/2021,stocks,esp w the bigger money leaving LV and  going to Macao
03/13/2021,stocks,I misses the dip on draftkings to 59 but got in at 62. Already returned nicely. Seems like its gonna be a decent run. Im not sure if its gonna hold up long term (1 year) with this growth but ready to let it ride

Its price genuinely scares the shit out of me. On top of that, management is paying themselves quite a lot of money, which brings net income down by a great degree at the expense of shareholders.

2021-03-13 04:37:58,stocks,"Impending eviction crisis? I do understand it will hurt people but on the scale of the US economy, is really not a crisis? Impending eviction crisis? I do understand it will hurt people but on the scale of economy it is really not really something like a crisis? What am I missing?

In the US, currently estimated with a few million families behind on rent. Even in the expensive state like California, the average is about 2% of household behind on rent with average amount of just $4500. That’s barely $400 million for California’s. Now scale that up at 2% of all households in entire US and say each household is behind by $20000, that will be an amount of $50 billion. 

Honestly, on scale of economy, $50 billion is practically peanuts. I mean take just Tesla for example, it gains and dropped well over $100 billion in valuation in one week. Also, 20k per household debt is nothing, average college graduates incur more debt than that. In the same time frame, US household saving rate is at record high at over 20%, that amount translates to a whopping $4000 extra saving per person. So there seems to be a lot of assets growth as comparing to debt. Of course the distribution is making economic inequality even worse.

So why is this described as a crisis? I can understand humanitarian aspect, but what’s going on there."

03/13/2021,stocks,"I’ve been in the default industry since 2007. This isn’t going to be a crisis. Many states, including the three I work in, have moratoriums in place. They have also put new requirements in place to evict tenants. If you were looking to evict some BEFORE the pandemic after a foreclosure it took at least six months and that was if they didn’t show up to court. Eviction cases drag on for months and sometimes years. The majority of the time loan services will pay the people (who have not paid their mortgage or rent for sometimes years) thousands of dollars to move out. It is cheaper than paying the taxes and paying us to get them out for months on end. Private landlords are having to deal with the same delays now. Also there are so many forbearance and other programs that it isn’t going to be a avalanche. The court docket is going to move super slow and defendants will be given every opportunity, no matter how ridiculous, to have more time. This isn’t going to be as big of an impact as the 2007 housing crisis. There are so many laws in place now since that crisis that loan services and private landlords are going to take this one on the chin. There is no going after back rent. The only way you can do that is through a money judgment. Courts are not going to be inclined to give those out. Even if they did, these tenants are “judgment proof”. You can’t squeeze water from a stone. They simply don’t have the money or assets to attach.  Unfortunately loan services and private landlords are going to be left holding the bag."
03/13/2021,stocks,"This is going to be a shit show.  Everyone thinks of landlords as rich fat cats who can absorb losses, but a ton of rental houses are owned by individuals trying to improve their family's financial positions.  These people are owed $20K+ and a lot of renters will simply get out of Dodge without paying, often leaving the place trashed.  The court systems are clogged and won't be able to deal with this.  Basically the homeowners will end up with government sanctioned theft of tens of thousands of dollars with no recourse.  Things will really get fun when it comes out many who skipped out on rent bought new SUVs or whatever.

An investment idea might be debt collection companies.  There are a couple of big publicly traded  ones, but I think they mainly deal with buying bad loans.  Good luck to rental owners on getting a court order that could be pursued."
03/13/2021,stocks,"This might sound callous, but where should I be looking to invest before this happens? Or is this something that one acts on after the fact?"
03/13/2021,stocks,There will probably be a ton of relief bills for renters on this issue. I feel small landlords will be harder hit than tenants. The megacorp rental places can absorb a loss but someone who bought a second home as a rental property can't.

Those who qualify continue to run the risk of not being able to service the new loan if the non- paying tenants are yet to be evicted; kind of a chicken and egg situation. This will be slow burn and we won’t begin to see the effects of this until Q2 of 2022. Will it take down the economy? probably not, but a ton of folks who got onto the invest in RE bandwagon over the last 10 years are going to be hurting real bad."
03/13/2021,stocks,"I understand, but the scale just doesn’t seem like a crisis, but I do think maybe it is more of political or social instability that will trigger the economical crisis."

Ever wonder why so many of the hedge funds, private banks, super Rich’s are now holding and owning more assets than even when their books were padded with those leveraged mortgage backed security."
03/13/2021,stocks,Plus more crime
03/13/2021,stocks,Joe is my guy!!!
03/13/2021,stocks,"I don't know the scale.  A fried of mine is going through this.  He is owed upwards of $30K and the couple apparently bought a new vehicle last Fall.  I told him unless they voluntarily pay, he is likely screwed.  Realistically he won't be able to get the money or it will be more trouble than it is worth.  There will be many who take advantage of that.   Understandably he is mad as hell.  He is still been on the hook for mortgage payments and property taxes.

It won't cause a crisis but it will cause a lot of turmoil and anger.  It also might have long term effects on the rental market.  There is now a risk with an example of city, state, or federal governments allowing people to use your property without payment.  The rental business is already fraught with dangers.  This makes it way more risky."

The phone and the computer are just tools to use. 

Either will suffice. 

If you're day trading, the phone might be more limiting as you can't see as much information simultaneously and you are likely trying get small gains by micro-timing trades. The phone might lead to some accidental mistakes.

If you're investing, you're really playing the long game.  You make a few purposeful trades and check in on them. You want to build a portfolio where you're trying to get all the gains you can, but you're also managing risks in case there is a downturn or a downturn in a particular industry. You don't need to be actively trading.

With that said, I use my computer more, so I can open more PDFs of analyst research on different stocks and funds. It is easier to read and quicker to go through different pieces of information.

But then I use my phone far more often to check in what is going on in my portfolio every day."

03/13/2021,stocks,"""Price is what you pay. Value is what you get."" - Warren Buffett

Pricing is determined by the matches of bids to asks. Let's say an ask for 100 shares at $5 is entered by a trading desk into a trading system (e.g. BATS) that posts it to an exchange (e.g. NYSE), when a matching bid meets that ask price the trade is executed.

Market makers, or large institutional investors with tremendous amounts of capital, can facilitate liquidity and control bid-ask price spreads because they act as a buyer and a seller.

Theoretically the price could go to zero if there weren't regulatory circuit breakers that are triggered when the price rises or falls 7, 13 or 20% within the same trading day (intraday).  At each level, trading is halted for longer periods of time.  These circuit breakers were first instituted as a result of the crash of October 1987, also known as ""Black Monday""."

2021-03-13 03:10:00,stocks,"QFIN DD - 360 Digitech, Value play - Earnings on 3/15  *Join me on this rocket ship named QFIN.*

I have ventured out of my usual territory in my hunt for an exotic rocket ship-shaped banana, and I’ve got good news for all ape-kind: I’ve found one. Here’s my DD (whatever that means). 

Ticker: **QFIN**, AKA ""360 Digitech"". They are a Chinese Fintech company. Currently trading around $31.50. Market Cap is around 4.8 Billion. Very few people in America have heard of them. PE is less than 10, growth is insane, plenty of cash on the balance sheet, low leverage, etc. From a fundamentals or cashflow analysis, this is a banana mine. 

**Here's their business model:**

*First*, they use their online presence to advertise loans to the rapidly-growing Chinese middle class.

*Second*, they use their proprietary risk-assessment tools to analyze the credit-worthiness of the applicants. They also have proprietary identification tools to help prevent fraud and simultaneously speed up the loan process (this is a bigger deal than it sounds like due to the strong desire for convenience in lending) 

*Third*, they partner with banks to supply the capital for the loans. 

*Fourth,* they service the loans and deal with recovery in case of defaults.

The business model is important because in order to understand why this is an amazing buy you also need to understand where their revenue comes from. It's not just loan interest as you would expect.

**But first, let’s talk numbers.** 2017 Revenue: *175 million* 2018 Revenue: *3.75 Billion* 2019 Revenue: *6.99 Billion* TTM: *9.19 Billion* (TTM means trailing twelve months)

Obviously that’s insane growth. Most apes can’t even count that high. 

And yet, despite that growth, their P/E ratio is a measly **9.4!** *(P/E is a measure of how high up tree us apes must climb to reach banana, lower number = banana more soon)* **That’s less than half the P/E of the S&P 500** *(P/E: 27.5*), **despite having significantly more growth.** 

To understand why the stock is still so cheap, let’s talk about why dumb apes might *NOT* want to buy it. 

Firstly, I assume most of you haven’t bought it yet because you have never heard of it. Do a search for QFIN on reddit – it’s next to impossible to find mention of it here. Furthermore, the trading volume is extremely low…. And most of the ownership is institutional. A few hedge funds, sure, but mostly ETFs, which is exactly what’s caused this great buying opportunity. As most Chinese Fintech stock prices have struggled lately with regulations (with the exception of this week), QFIN is relatively immune from the changes. QFIN has only gone down because most of the ownership is through the sector ETFs, which have been dragging QFIN down with them. Only recently did it buck the trend and move away from its sector's performance, in large part because people are just now starting to notice it.

This is a misunderstood company with obvious value. The play here isn’t that there’s extra value - the value is obvious to everyone - the play is that the “problems” are being significantly exaggerated and misunderstood… so rather than tell you where the deep value is, I will instead focus on why the doubters are wrong and why QFIN is uniquely placed in its sector. 

**First Reason for Doubt – Winnie the Pooh.** The Chinese Fintech industry has recently been slapped with some extra regulations that I had to get my mandarin-speaking wife to translate for me. 

One regulation is that for microlending transactions involving banks and partners, the partners (in this case, QFIN) must contribute at least 25% of the capital. Here’s a breakdown of the rules: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-20/china-imposes-further-caps-on-online-lending-amid-clampdown](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-20/china-imposes-further-caps-on-online-lending-amid-clampdown). *The stock tanked 30% when this happened.*

**Why it doesn’t matter:** According to QFIN’s CEO, Wu “Cock Slapper” Haisheng, *“Currently, the outstanding balance of the outstanding loans issued through our micro lending subsidiary, accounts for less than 1% of the total loan balance, and joint lending accounts for around 0.01%. Therefore, based on our personal evaluation, the new rules will have little impact on our loan origination business.”* 

Another new regulation is that online lending can only be done with banks that are established in the same province as the applicant. This is no problem – QFIN has a multitude of partners in each region. There are other new regulations coming down the pipeline (capital requirements, etc) but QFIN is well capitalized and capable of overcoming all the known issues. 

**Second Reason for Doubt – Default Risk.** There is concern that the loan default rate will be high, especially if China’s economy crashes, and that this will destroy the value of the company similarly to what happened to US banks with bad mortgages in 2008.

**Why it doesn’t matter:** First of all, *sack up.* 

Now that we’ve covered that primary reason, the fact of the matter is that default risk will always be a thing for banks. But QFIN isn’t a bank. *(Actually, they technically do have a banking charter in case they have to become one for due to new regulations, but they aren't currently using it.)* Remember their business model I mentioned earlier? 

*Now consider this:* 

Remember that 9.9 billion revenue for the trailing twelve months? Of that 9.9 billion, 2.3 billion is interest income. *(600mm interest expense).* Meanwhile, **they’re receiving 8 billion in service revenue**. (source: [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/QFIN/financials?p=QFIN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/QFIN/financials?p=QFIN)) They’re bringing in far more money from loan origination commissions and the SaaS fees for their credit analysis than they’re bringing in from actual interest income. In other words, they aren’t a bank. What’s even more important is that QFIN literally does have the best proprietary software, as evidenced by the default rates of their loans. Compare QFIN’s loans defaults to FINV’s, who shot up *90%* yesterday after their earnings call. Go to slide 17: [https://ir.360shuke.com/static-files/6ffd9815-c5d3-478e-81df-0f4b3eb1ad0f](https://ir.360shuke.com/static-files/6ffd9815-c5d3-478e-81df-0f4b3eb1ad0f) 

If you’re too lazy to click the link, the TL DR is that QFIN’s historical defaults for every tranche is significantly lower. 

Another facet to consider is that even if their interest income does drop significantly, their operating margin is strong and, more importantly, improving. Despite their revenue increasing significantly, “Total operating expenses, excluding provisions were roughly flat Q-on-Q but decreased 33% year-on-year. The year-on-year decline mainly reflects significant improvement in operational efficiency” – CFO Alex “Oh God Please No Not My Face” Xu 

**Third Reason for Doubt – uNaUdiTeD fInAnCiALs**

OK so this is the best criticism the bears have. It’s also the most nebulous. 

A few things to think about: 

This is a Chinese company with Chinese consumer loans on their balance sheet. The QFIN ticker is an ADR. I’m not an accountant, but AFAIK all of the Chinese fintech companies without a US presence use unaudited financials. I don’t think it’s that weird. 

Speaking of accounting, QFIN has a history of overestimating expected losses. *In other words, they used pessimistic estimates that make their financials look worse than they really are.* Back in 2Q2020, Chinese regulators slapped a cap on the interest rate of internet-sourced loans. Some of QFIN’s loans at the time were above that rate, meaning they were impacted. An unscrupulous CFO would not have marked down the loans in anticipation of a decrease in value due to the new, lower interest they would be receiving*. QFIN did the opposite – they devalued the loans by too much* (mostly because they overestimated the default rate). “...the high take rate for capital-light model in the third quarter, maybe partially contributed to a reversal of the charge in the second quarter.” – Ethan “Prolapse King” Wang, paraphrasing something the CFO took two minutes to explain when asked why the loans were doing better than anticipated after being devalued.

**What risks are there still?**

First and foremost, macroeconomic risks. As the Chinese consumer fares, so does QFIN. I view this as a good thing, not a bad one, but it does constitute a risk. Additional regulation from Winnie-The-Pooh represents a risk too, but it looks like, for now, that storm has mostly passed. My take is that the Chinese regulators seemed to have a hard on for fucking up Ant Group – a spinoff of Alibaba. Jack “Actual Vampire” Ma had mouthed off publicly about regulations and so the CCP went after him with even more regulations after disappearing the guy for a month. Ant Group focuses more on microlending, but QFIN’s stock, as another Chinese Fintech company, got dragged down by the bears despite not really being affected. Ant group is finally approved for their IPO, so it looks like Winnie’s red rocket for regulation is rapidly retracting.

**Any big banana showers coming soon?** YES! **Earnings call on 3/15!** QFIN has a history of smashing earnings estimates. If QFIN has even half the success of FINV, who went up 90% on the day of their earnings call, then it’ll be bananas for everyone. Apes taking a rocket ship to banana planet. 

If you still aren’t convinced just look at the fucking fundamentals you god damn baboon. 

TLDR: I like the stock.

I’m fairly new to investing, and have mainly invested in companies that would be considered household names. These are stocks that a lot of other people have probably done due diligence on and determined that they were safe. Most of my time investigating stocks has been reading articles about other people’s opinions on the stock, and I’ve spent no time at all reading any sort of data out out by the companies, mainly because I don’t know how to read this sort of thing. I realize this isn’t an ideal strategy. If I knew what sort of things to look for, I might be more inclined to do so. So, what metrics do you use when you are doing your due diligence?

03/13/2021,stocks,"Hey, this may be a little long but this is the guide I try to follow when doing my DD, learned from some super helpful people on the platform. The only thing I don't do regularly are technicals :/, I can be lazy. Hope it helps!

#**The Basics**

**Financials** - This is one of the most important things to look for in a company when considering an investment. Things like where they get their revenue and how diversified it is. Look at earnings reports and see if they have consistent EPS growth. A healthy company will show modest income and strong ERs. Apart from the revenue find how much debt they have long term and how much it really equates to that specific industry. Things like market cap and annual sales give you an idea of how large the company is and what size you're dealing with. Typically larger companies have healthier financials and positive revenue hence blue chip stocks. The more you look at this the better idea you'll have of what good financials look like.

**Data** - This is where you get into the ins and outs of the stocks performance. This ties in with chart analysis and technicals which I will briefly touch on. Here you are looking at the numbers, net income, sales, cash flow, public float, dividend, and short interest. My go to is checking the short interest % because it gives you an idea of the number of short sellers vs long term shareholders. Less shorters usually = more sustainable profits long term. Different websites also have analysts that give a consensus rating for the current stock's value, these can be nice as long as you don't only look at one. Along with that they also give out 1 year target price estimates. Gather the data together and take notes.

**News** - News is a big factor in DD and often has a big influence on the stocks value. Depending on the intensity and how big the news is, it can create selloffs, surges, etc. It's important to note that news is certainly not everything as a lot of the time it will present underwhelming or even irrelevant depending on what the intraday market trend is. This provides good opportunities for entry points if the news is slightly bad but not long term because the dip will only be temporary. News can be so many different things ranging from employee layoffs, financials, products, etc. Gather it together and assess how you think it will influence value. You have to be on top of news and have sources to be up to date because the market reacts almost instantly. (Refer to source section at bottom)

**History &amp; Technicals** - Next up we have the technicals, i'm merging this with history because this is what I do. Here you mainly want to look at 5 year charts and then get into the 1 year to stay current. Search for healthy trend lines and sustainability for the long term. When looking at these you're seeing the stock's history and how it performed under past market trends. I like to see how they did during the 2008 recession and note how fast they recovered. This can be a good reference for current and future market dips (pandemics).Find bearish or bullish indicating patterns to represent the current future of the value. The shorter you plan on holding, the more technicals are required.

**Sector**- Last but not least is sector position. The company's industry can be performing really well or really poor depending on the economic situation. For example tech companies have been showing stronger trends during the pandemic rather than retailers for numerous reasons. Similar to the oil crisis situation that brings all the oil stocks down. This is a starting point when investing in a company and determining how you think their sector will do in the future. Many traders stay specific to industries they know well, as myself i'm big on the entertainment/psychedelics area.

*Sources*

There are many websites that report news and data but here are my favorites.

Market Watch is my favorite and I use them to find stock data most of the time

Investopedia - great for news

Market Beat - data, analysts, etc

Yahoo Finance - news, good source for everything

Finviz - technicals, screeners

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Since that's the basics and general overview, here's a compilation of various processes and tips that will hopefully offer a little more specificity and assistance. 

**Free sources I can check:**

- Wikipedia: Read the story behind their company
- Company site: What they do
- Seeking Alpha: Latest analysis
- Sec Site: Read 10Q and 10K (Unaudited financials and company filings)

**What I need to be capable of understanding:**

- The company's plan for growth
- Your own level of confidence in your research
- The challenges and economic cycles of this industry 

Be able to summarize/condense the business or industry in a short paragraph or a couple of sentences. 

**Moat** 

- What is the Moat?

- How hard is it to compete with this company?

- Compare this company to its competition.

- What are the Big Four Growth Rates (Net Income, Book Value, Sales, Operating Cash)? Are they speeding up or slowing down?

- Does the company have enough cash to last several year if it looses money?

- How were sales and earnings during the last recession?

**Management**

- Does the CEO have integrity?
- Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well but clam up or disclaim responsibility when trouble occurs?
- How happy are its employees?
- Does the company have any debt? If yes, could it be paid with one or two years of free cash flow?
- Has the company indicated that it plans to take on debt any time in the future?
- Is the management team buying or selling its company's stock? (Inside investors)
- How are the Return on Equity and Return on Invested Capital Numbers of the year?

03/13/2021,stocks,"This is not investment advice.

In order of importance to me, and if any step fails to deliver what I'm looking for, I'll probably move on to something else:

1. The balance sheet over an absolute minimum of 3 years, depending on if other things check out, I will go back further. Capital structure is the single most important figure to me. I look for lots of cash and low to non-existent debt. The more debt the company has, the more other factors in the business have to make up for it.

2. Income statement and cash flows. The best way I can understand a business is to find out exactly how inflows and outflows change the balances on the balance sheet. Sometimes numbers don't add up for me, and if that happens, I walk away because it's a sign I don't understand the business. Do not mistake this for me suggesting any kind of fraudulent activity in the company, I literally mean that this is my shortcoming and there probably are people out there who understand what I don't. 

3. I calculate some ratios depending on the type of business. ROA, ROE, ROCE - depends on whether or not it makes sense for that specific business. Just to get a feel for what's going on.

4. Annual reports over several years. The annual reports usually break down different business segments, so I can see where the money really comes from and are they focusing on the real cash generation or on something non-existent. Read the notes on the annual reports. I can't for the life of me understand why anyone skips the notes. Everything is in the notes.

Notes. Read them.

5. Audit comment. This may not seem like a big deal, but if the audit report finds material misstatements, I walk away. If the auditor who had gone over their invoices and accounts can't make sense of the business, how the hell can I trust my own analysis? Qualifying statements are not a deal breaker, you just have to compare that to the notes again.


6. Earnings transcripts. I now know which parts of the business are the real earners, so I want to hear management talk about that. If they instead talk for a long time about what fantastic growth they have in this one niche segment that accounts for 0.01% of revenues, I suspect something is badly wrong and I go back to the annual reports to understand why they're pulling wool over your eyes.

7. Depending on the size of the business, insider buying/selling. It's hard to tell much on insider activity when it's a big corporation, but if it's a small company with a handful of executives and everyone's selling all their stake in the company, I hesitate to buy until I understand why exactly that has happened.

8. Largest shareholders and are those hedge funds successful in their other ventures or are they gamblers. Also if they've been heavily selling or buying and at what price.

9. Historical prices in relation to everything above to see if this is a turnaround story, a dog, a cash cow, good value or overpriced in the light of everything I've analyzed.

When I buy, I am convinced and/or deluded enough to sleep well at night because I've vetted the entire company.

The rest of the time I just read up on news and press releases and keep current on the financials. If nothing has changed in the list above, I hold and reinvest dividends and then some. If something has changed, I sell."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Sites that I use:

* [IPO Calendar](https://www.marketwatch.com/tools/ipo-calendar) - to keep an eye out for IPOs I'm interested in

And other than that, I use TA indicators such as MACD, chart patterns, volume, RSI, etc."
03/13/2021,stocks,"So here's  what I do for 90+% of my portfolio:

I don't research any stocks, just go buy a widely held index fund.   See r/bogleheads or [https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Getting\_started](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Getting_started) lots of deep insight into why this on average, will beat most active funds.   In other words:  I researched a long-term investment strategy that is proven to work instead of doing the work of trying to pick individual stocks.   

One data point about the statement above.   The most recent [SP Global report](https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/spiva/#/reports) for 2020 showed that just over 75% of funds underperformed the S&P 500 index.  This means that the majority of the most highly paid and valuable fund managers don't succeed in beating the market.  So I don't see why I should feel like I can beat the performance of people who do this for a living.

Now, note I said 90%,  There is 10% of my portfolio I invest in things which I believe in long-term or that makes me happy to own a piece of or that reflects a trend I'm seeing and I want to invest a tiny bit in.   

Some examples:

I bought a couple of shares of  TSLA like 2-3 years ago when it was 1/10th of the price it is now (pre-split, so I now have 10 shares).   I bought it because I don't think anyone should bet against Elon Musk, and I think that TSLA will survive long into the future.  

I have a bit of DAL (Delta Airlines) during the covid dip because I am a big fan of the way they treat their customers as opposed to the other 2 big US airlines, and I couldn't pass up getting some of their stock on sale.

I have a couple of shares each of a few thematic ETFs that I find intriguing such as IPO, BUZZ, and SFYF.   Or ones that make my inner geek happy such as ROKT.    And I have (or more accurately trying to reduce my position to) 1 share each of the ARK funds.

I also have a few individual shares of companies that haven't fully recovered from COVID yet, but I would expect to like cruise companies and the like.

Note that all of the holdings in this 10% of my portfolio I consider to be a 'gambling' portfolio.   If any of them go to zero, I'm not going to care.   Well, I'll care, but it won't be the end of the world.   But I don't rely on it for my retirement."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Well basically I like to look at the high for the year; if it’s below it, I find any “reasons” behind the dip, and buy if that reason is temporary, 

So far I’m only down 98%

03/13/2021,stocks,"I look at job listings.  I've probably interviewed over two thousand engineers the past thirty years and written a lot of job postings.  If a company isn't hiring or their job listings poorly done, then that's a really bad sign."
03/13/2021,stocks,"* Market Cap. (Total value of outstanding shares)

* management and ownership.

* balance sheet exam. (Long term debt?) ( debt not necessarily bad )"
03/13/2021,stocks,"Here's my current calendar of events that I watch for general market conditions:

The Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee has 8 board meetings per year.  The schedule is posted online.  Announcements from these meetings can really move the entire market.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics publishes its Jobs Report around the first Friday of every month at 8:30 am Eastern time.  This is also a market mover.

The Dept of Labor publishes is Jobless Claims report every week on Thursday at 8:30am Eastern time.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics releases the Consumer Price Index report every month around the 10th or so.

Also, if you go to Yahoo Finance and pull up a stock ticker, go to the Analysis tab and look on the right side of the browser window, you can see a lot of information about earnings estimates.  These are also available through Charles Schwab's trading platform research portal.  Some of this info can save you from having to go to a company's website, to the investor relations, and read through their SEC filings.  I mostly look for strong or growing revenue and earnings.

Price to Earnings ratio is a good metric, but to guage it you really need to compare it to similar companies in the same industry or with similar profiles.  The lower the price to earnings ratio, the better, generally speaking.  This is more of a signal whether the stock is already to overvalued to risk buying.

Oh, and here's a trick to get you started: If you're wondering which stocks to start researching, try this:  pick some mutual funds that mirror your investment strategy and make a spreadsheet that lists their top holdings.  See which stocks seem to be repeatedly in the top holdings of those funds, then start your research there."

___

In general I stick only with sectors and industries that I am familiar with.  That way, I know pretty quickly what to look for in terms what their product or service is, and if its of any quality.

Then I'll look at their ""fundamentals.""  Their revenue, assets, profit, and debt.  I like to see a history of these numbers for the past 5 years, if the company has been around at least that long.  There are more fundamentals, but those are the four I look for.  As you read more and more of these about more and more companies, you'll learn more and more about which details there matter.

Try to find moves the company has made to get better position.  Sourcing deals, partnerships, spinoffs, mergers, anything.  Seeing jumps or drops in stock price history can hint about what time frame in which those events occurred.

Then I take a gander at the competition.

After that, I look at leadership.  You need to know about the people calling the shots, because they determine whether the company is successful, stagnant, or failing.  They determine the vision, direction, and path to their goals.  A company with a great product, lots of profit, tons of assets, and little debt doesn't mean shit to me if their *new* CEO is SuckBob FuckPants.  Bad leaders can tank good companies.

Conversely, good leadership can save failing companies. 

So find out who's calling the shots, who the CEO is, CTO or whatever, head of research, anyone.  Their career history, the track records of previous companies they've worked for (did they save something or tank it, or just meh?), where they went to school, etc.  It doesn't have to be FBI-class dossiers, but you should be able to name names and say ""They did such and such at X company before, and now they're at Y and building/doing an even better version!""

Fight your own confirmation bias.  Look for potential obstacles for that company, and give them real consideration.  This is why I stick to things that I know - I'll already be familiar with industry trends and common obstacles.  By doing this, I can skip writing many pages about obstacles.

The reason to do any DD is to inform yourself, but it helps me to pretend like I'm writing for a group of serious investors.  Once you've read, summarized, sorted and collated all of the relevant info and have a nice 5-pager, you can take a day off, then read the whole thing over again with a clear head.

And have fun.  I'm weird, but DD is hella fun for me.  I have no idea why."
03/13/2021,stocks,"1) **Relative Valuation to Peers** and how that ticker stacks up to a specific comp set. Are they trading conspicuously below their peers? Is there a reason *why* the market is pricing them at a discount? If not, probably undervalued.

Trading multiples from most important to least as follows:

* EV / '21E EBITDA

* EV / '22E EBITDA

* P / '21E CFPS

* P / '22E CFPS

* P / '21E FCFPS

* P / '22E FCFPS

2) **Leverage profile** also compared to peers. Relevant multiples / metrics below:

* Net Debt / LTM EBITDA

* Current Liquidity (cash + revolver availability)

Filings solvency / balance sheet dilligence: 
 
* Do they have any impending debt maturity towers in '21 and '22? 
* Do they have enough liquidity + FCF to cover any looming payments? 
* What sort of guidance has management issued during their Q4 earnings call about next years capital budget? Did any analysts push on management during Q&A over liquidity (or any other particular topic)?

If not, kind of sounds like they are in deep shit, particularly if they have solid fundamentals but seems to be trading at a lower multiple compared to peers.

 * Do they have preferred shares hidden on their BS. Are they a value play that trades largely on yield - ergo, dividend payments aren't going to be easy to cut to enhance any liquidity shortfalls.

Anyhow, I'm not saying that doing DD can't be super beneficial, but I think its going to be hard to find anything beneficial that isnt already priced in.

Im not a huge idiot and can read financial statements better than the average Joe being an accountant, that said I stick to investing in blue chip and well established companies.

03/13/2021,stocks,"There are a thousand and one things that might be included in one's DD. And quite possibly all of them can offer pros and cons in one's decision to buy or sell a derivative. However, at the end of the day, it's still market sentiment (supply and demand) that dictates price. With MM's and HF's always manipulating price action it's difficult to place fair value. Look at TESLA, for instance, trading at over 1000 times forward earnings. Myself, I would never pay $800 for an $80 stock. This isn't to say that one day TESLA's fair market value wouldn't be worth $800. Just not today. Not to me. Most folks go by a derivatives P/E ratio but, there again, I routinely see inflated prices there too. And there's so much misinformation being spewed daily by MSM it's anybody's guess. I rely mainly on price action itself using technical analysis and current market sentiment. Keeping current on economic news helps determine possible forward price action as well."

03/13/2021,stocks,"^ This. I’ve just recent started my portfolio a month or so back and have been green following a strategy like this. Even through the recent Nasdaq sell off.

Have a diversified portfolio of value/growth stocks. My growth stocks are companies I really like (maybe products I use every day or I think have value for the long term). The value portion are stocks with strong fundamentals growth, positive EPS, low p/e, low Long-term debt to capital, and potentially trading below book value.

I choose my value stocks by first running a scan on think or swim with the following conditions:

1) Stock Price > $5
2) 10k Volume or more
3) P/E between 0-15

From there, I add fundamentals columns like book value, p/e, current EPS, EPS 5-yr avg, current Revenue, Revenue 5-yr avg, current LT Debt to capital, and LT Debt to capital 5 years ago. 

I take this data, copy and paste it to a spreadsheet, then run some if statements to see if the stock is trading below book value, has current Revenue growth higher than 5-yr avg, EPS growth, and reduction in debt. If all these conditions are met, I then do research into the company to see what they do and recent news. Also maybe check out their website as well.

Following these rules, I’ve found some hidden gems and have made double digit % returns in 2-3 weeks time. Stocks like NXST, CFFI, VWAGY, PDM, BRK/B, and SPTN have done really well for me even when the recent market sell off was happening."
03/13/2021,stocks,"This is a lot of good advice, I try to balance my portfolio by the sector and readjust every 12 months (or sooner if a major change happens like the last 2 presidential elections and coronavirus) by what I think is the right weighting.  

So I actually start with sector and narrow a screening list down... i.e. I want to add an Industrial company then I will look at fin viz map and start pulling together a short list of about 5-15 companies and quickly compare the financials and scan the news to narrow it down to 2-5 options.  Then I dig deeper into the other details you mentioned. 

Until I have narrowed it down to 1-2 favorites.  Sometimes I will go for 1 sometimes I will go for both, but usually I will put in 10-20% of my planned investment and start following it for a few weeks b/c once I have money in I am much more serious about it.  Then I will add more over the course of 1-2 months."

03/13/2021,stocks,"You can do better as an individual investor because you can do things that a massive fund cannot do. Either by regulation, rule, or size, mutual funds often cannot do things to maximize their absolute returns.

You, as an individual investor, can hold concentrated positions, buy derivatives, and avoid sectors altogether. You can use margin and buy penny stocks. Large fund managers can't do a lot of this. The managers, if they didn't have constraints, would probably have a much higher win rate.

Totally agree that passive index funds should be used for the planning/beta bucket, but for those with a little time on their hands, stock picking can be amazing for the absolute return/alpha bucket."

03/13/2021,stocks,"When you read a bear or bull case for a company based on X, Y, or Z, dive deeper to see if X, Y, or Z are accurate assumptions, relevant to the company, or whatever else.

Perhaps a bear case states something like a customer base is in decline. Perhaps the company has addressed this in their annual report and has been implementing measures to shift from that customer base to another stream of revenue. Then you can read their Quarterly and Annual reports to see if that shift is occurring, how rapidly, and if there are growth opportunities there. Things like that.

In short, do due diligence on other people's due diligence."

03/13/2021,stocks,"Not just that, but hedge funds routinely fail to beat the market because their goal is guess what, not to beat the market. Their goal, and fiduciary responsibility of pension funds, etc. is growth with reduced risk. They are protecting their downsides, not maximizing returns.

Additionally, it's a hell of a lot harder for a hedge fund to enter and exit positions (sometimes taking months to avoid sizeable impacts on price), especially as you look outside of megacap companies and are talking the bulk of funds that have $1b+ under management.

Retail investors are much more nimble, generally are willing to accept more risk, and perhaps most importantly, can enter/exit based on the time horizon and risk tolerance that's relevant to them, not to the folks they need to report to. How a retail investor fairs compared to benchmark in any year is irrelevant if they believe in their thesis. They can take longer term investment timeframes that the bulk of mutual and hedge funds can't.

Funds are way too concerned with their performance compared to peers and benchmarks, rather than the performance of their overall investment thesis."
03/13/2021,stocks,"A P/E under 25 is good, under 15 is awesome. Lower is better. N/A is bad and a negative P/E means they don’t make any money lol. 

Basically this shows you how high the price of the stock is compared to the company earnings. Tech stocks always have fairly high P/E ratio because they basically price in the future potential of the company. Therefore more risky"
03/13/2021,stocks,"Market caps a good metric to know what a company’s valued at. For example: ABNB is worth 120B market cap, the largest casino stock is worth 40B market cap, it gives you an idea of how to compare whether you’re getting a fair deal compared to others in the industry."
03/13/2021,stocks,"A market cap just measures a company’s size As an example, a company with 10 million shares selling for $100 each would have a market cap of $1 billion.

So there is no good or bad market cap it’s just how big the company is. 

The higher the market cap the more likely that since it’s a larger company that is more stable than a “small cap” they are more volatile. 

For example it’s more likely that a small unheard of business goes under rather than say Walmart."

Another thing to think about is if your goal is wealth creation vs wealth preservation. Diversification helps with the latter

03/13/2021,stocks,"Hedge funds aside, which are a very broad category, mutual funds underperform the market on risk-adjusted metrics (Sharpe, etc.), too.

03/13/2021,stocks,"P/E is one of my favorite indicators. As you mention, it’s really about P/Future Earnings. Like if the P/E Is “good” today, but you expect earnings to rise in the future, then likely Price will rise with it

P/S is my second favorite, but still important, then book value. Hard to work with cool vale because sometimes it just reflects an operating model that is highly leveraged. Some people think that is bad"
03/13/2021,stocks,"Be careful giving too much weight to P/E ratios.

The term ""value trap"" exists for a reason.

It is an essential component of a good fundamental evaluation, but it is only one of many components.

A P/E ratio of 10 looks great today, but when FY2 P/E is 30, or revenue is expected to decline, or their technology is becoming obsolete, or they consistently dilute shareholders, or have an unsustainable amount of debt, have no clear moat, etc.

Usually companies with ultra attractive P/E ratios are priced that way for a reason. Yes, it can very well be market inefficiency, but I'd say based on my experience it's much more likely that the market has priced the equity appropriately based on a dim future.

Whether or not you agree with that future and the way the market has priced the equity is what may provide you with an entry point/opportunity."
03/13/2021,stocks,is there an approximate market cap where companies go from being considered volatile to stable?
03/13/2021,stocks,Can you share?  I let you know about Aflac with their small 7.5 P/E.
03/13/2021,stocks,100%.
03/13/2021,stocks,"Large Cap - $10 billion or more 

Mid Cap - between $2 billion and $10 billion 

Small cap - between $300 million to $2 billion

Small cap companies are higher risk investments because they have less resources so they are more sensitive to economic slowdowns. So small cap share prices tend to be more volatile and less liquid than mature and larger companies. At the same time, small companies often provide greater growth opportunities than large-caps.

2021-03-13 03:01:34,stocks,"Investment strategies at 18? Hi everyone,

I’m new to this sub so I hope this is the right place to post.

Just turned 18 a couple months ago and I just got around to converting my Custodial account into my own personal account no longer under my parents control. They are still added as trusted advisors (or whatever Schwab calls them). 

Some context about me, my experience, and my end goals: I have about $5k (mostly unrealized) in my account (and a little bit more in a Roth IRA, but I’m not looking to do a ton of trading in that account). My parents have taught me a lot about the market and set up a custodial account a few years ago and asked me what I wanted to invest in. I currently own 4 shares of ADBE (bought at $285/share), just over 21 shares of AAPL (bought at $52/share), and I just sold the last of my 3 shares of MRNA for a decent profit. I know how the stock market works, how options work (although I don’t believe my account is approved for options trading yet), etc etc. Basically, I know how things work, but I don’t know how to play things necessarily. Obviously I know when to buy and sell in general but I don’t know how I should play the market long term.

My questions are what should my strategies be to making term profit, and still have a bit of fun? ;) Should I look into options trading (yes I know about r/options )? How much of my earnings should I devote to investing? What kind of stocks should I look into buying? How should I research stocks? Any and all advice would be appreciated! 

Thanks!

TL;DR
I’m young, what kind of investing should I be doing and what strategies would you suggest?"

03/13/2021,stocks,"You have the advantage of time, you don't need big returns (or the big risk of loss that comes with it)... Put your money in an index fund and sit on it.

Every dollar you invest in that index fund is worth $160 at retirement."
03/13/2021,stocks,"I would advise no on the options, at your age.  Focus on college and on your career.  One thing that you will have an edge with your age is that you have a very unique vantage point on the future.

You know what clothes, games, movies, restaurants, social networks, etc. are popular with young people (these will grow in value and will be good investments but may take a while) and which are avoided because they are old and lame (these will probably be bad investments) vs you like them but can't afford them yet (these are probably good investments now).  

You will also see what everyone is studying in school and who is hiring or which majors are getting no jobs and going to work at starbucks after they graduate.  The companies that are hiring are doing well, invest in them.  Invest in industries where they vacuum up all the smart people.  Sometimes it is finance, software, defense contractors, energy companies, biomed, or something else.  But when you are in school and you see who is paying top dollar for interns and making offers to the smartest kids, those companies have tons of work and tons of cash.

Old people have more money to invest but they don't have this boots on the ground perspective."
03/13/2021,stocks,"I realize you might already have a lot of this under control, but If I was to tell my 18 year old self something, this is what I'd say:

1) Go to [https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics) and follow that plan.   Or if you're more visual, see [https://i.imgur.com/lSoUQr2.png](https://i.imgur.com/lSoUQr2.png) .   Things I've learned the hard way: Don't go into debt.  Buy vehicles with cash, and reserve debt for a mortgage on your home.  Credit cards are ok, as long as you pay them off every month so you never pay interest on them, especially if you get good benefits by using them.   But if you find that having an open credit line on a credit card is too tempting for you, switch to debit cards instead.

2) Save as much as possible, fully fund a Roth IRA every year you can.  The amount you save is more important than how you invest it, provided you're not completely stupid about it.  Saving earlier is better than waiting until later.

3) Once you have enough saved to invest, put all of your investments in an index fund, and as you get older some bonds.  Or use a low-cost target-retirement fund.   At your age, just stick it in VTI or if you want some international exposure VT (or VTI+VXUS if you want to control how much international).   See r/Bogleheads for resources for why this works and will generally beat any performance you will do on your own.

4) If you do want to play in the stock market, don't do it with the funds you are saving for retirement.   Instead, set aside some separate funds to play with, generally being less than 10% of your total invested amount.   Think of this as money you'd take to vegas to gamble with and you'll have the right idea."

I’d look in to a China ETF and then balance with some strong US companies like ADBE, PYPL, SQ and so on. FAANG isn’t going away either.

If developed vs. emerging is not to your liking, you can swap VEU with VEA and VWO and customize again. This type of granularity is possible by geography, style, sector and so on. These are Vanguard examples, but most fund families have similar funds. Start simple though. The most important thing is to start and keep going, as time is your friend.

03/13/2021,stocks,"The S&P outpaces inflation.  If he puts $100 a month into an S&P index fund from now until he's 68, he'll have a little over $2.2 million.

**To put this into perspective:** That's $60,000 in payments spread over 50 years for a return that's worth over $616,000 inflation adjusted back to the present (today's dollars; assuming 2.5% annual inflation as a benchmark)."
03/13/2021,stocks,"There are two separate scenarios here:

1) I have the cash that I'm going to commit to buying whatever it is, and I'm going to make the decision to defer payments over the 4 year note at zero percent so I can leave the cash in the interest-bearing account longer.   But I'm going to allocate 100% of the cash that I have now in order to make payments.

2) I don't have the cash to buy this, but I'm going to do so anyways, using the zero percent interest promotion to justify it as a good deal, and hope that my current situation continues so I can make payments over the 4 years.

\#1 is probably acceptable, although you also have to factor in risk.   I'd argue #2 is a bad choice even at zero percent interest.

The key difference between #1 and #2 is that with #1 you can make the payment go away at any time by moving funds around.   With #2, you have tied up future earnings and also tied yourself to those payments.

I've also found over the years that most of us don't factor in risk nearly enough.   Every time I've been bit it's because there was risk I hadn't foreseen.   Imagine someone with #2 (or even #1, where they dumped the money in the stock market instead of a safe savings account), who lost their job due to the coronavirus and burnt through all of their savings trying to stay alive.

By paying for everything upfront, or at the minimum committing cash in hand to pay off the note, one significantly reduces the downside risk."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Yeah I suppose in my thinking I had assumed the person has ensured they will be able to meet future payments,which shouldn't be an assumption.

2021-03-13 02:36:08,stocks,"Had my first ""learning experience"" with FOMO - invested in a stock that went straight down...wondering how bad I goofed. I know I'm not investing big money but to me its a good amount and I am learning. I'm looking for some insight on my goof and what you would do in this situation. 

A couple of days ago I put $1000 into CSTR.V when it was at $0.52 a share. I saw how much it was going up in the past and after some research I thought it was due to go up more. By end of day it dropped to $0.35 cents a share. So I'm down pretty hard relativity speaking. 

I was wondering what is the strategy now? Do I buy more at the lower price? Do I wait it out? Do I sell? 

For now I'm just going to hold and see what happens. The $1000 i put into it I consider ""gone"". I was wondering if there are other indicators or strategies I can look into at this point.

If it was me, I would get out asap and not look back, even if it was to pump more in the next few days."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Two quick points:

1. There is nothing wrong with selling a stock at a loss. Sometimes your plan doesn't work out. The price you paid for a share does not matter. That is the past. What matters is the current share price and the probability of that share price increasing over a given time period. If there are better stocks to go into, sell at a loss and put your money to better use elsewhere. 
2. You have to learn that some plays are long-term holds that you can largely ignore after purchasing. Other, higher-risk higher-reward plays need to be watched constantly. You're playing penny stocks (super risky). You need to pay very close attention. Setting stop losses and limit sells also helps."

03/13/2021,stocks,"1. Do you have enough capital to buy a crap ton of cheaper shares then swing trade out of the position at cost or a cent or so profit. You'd have to be quick and watch for a day its got volume but I have done it 

2. Do you believe in the company? Loss is only real when you sell. If it's a significant amount and you think the company has potential let it ride just a little longer. I may uptick back to your original position, or at least lessen the hit"
03/13/2021,stocks,"You bought it for a reason. I don't know what the reason is. If the reason is unchanged, then you hold. If the reason has changed, then you re-evaluate."
03/13/2021,stocks,"I'm not any sort of investing expert. My strategy would be to research the shit out of that company so I had a feeling (or better yet supporting numbers) about what was going to happen. If I believed there was a shot at recovery quickly, lowering my average would be great. If I didn't like the stock I'd let it sit for a few years or sell it."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Biggest issue you have.. is you didn't have a plan when you entered the trade. Always have a plan for what to do when the chart goes against you before you enter a trade, that way you aren't trying to figure out what to do on the fly. At this point I would probably just set a tight stop and hope for another pump..or just sell and look for a better spot."

03/13/2021,stocks,If you sell now you're guaranteed a loss. I know nothing of this stock or penny stocks in general. Do your research.
03/13/2021,stocks,I agree. If I jump into a company just for the quick run up and it doesn't do what I expected it to do I cut my losses. I've averaged down on a hype play a bunch before saying screw it. It hurts but that's a lesson learned. When you do get out take it off your watchlist. Don't look it up again. Just move on.
03/13/2021,stocks,"Yeah, sometimes you have to cut your losses. I did this with 2 stocks. Just didn't do my DD. Did DD on them afterwards, dumped one with a 50% loss after realizing it was a sh!t company,  still holding onto My other on at a 50% loss, but the company isn't complete sh!t, so maybe it'll come back."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Sounds good- pennies are hit and miss and you have to accept the misses for the hits. You can’t apply normal investing theory to penny stocks. Averaging down is not allowed unless you truly believe in the company and can make a good argument. Stop losses make sense here no questions asked and zero tolerance for shadiness. What a waste of time it is to pay hours of attention to worthless DD and hoping for gains based on confirmation bias and the unvetted “advice” from fellow experts/enthusiasts in Reddit and ticker-centric discord channels. Wishing I could rewind about 5 weeks and just dump every single penny stock at the highest gain point regardless of whatever “plans” I had for it, and reevaluate in the dip with 40% more cash on hand. Lesson learned!!"

2021-03-13 01:56:04,stocks,"Is too much stock exposure a bad thing? I have 50% of my net worth sitting in a 401k. Invested in 70% growth, 10% in value, 10% Small-Cap, 10% REIT. Just rebalanced the beginning of the year.

I have 6 months set aside as an emergency fund in the bank.

I have 35% of my net worth sitting in a brokerage account that is 90% cash at the moment.

I got the additional cash in the brokerage account from the sale of a house and with the low interest rates decided to take out the larger mortgage and make the cash work rather than dumping it into the house. It was gaining 1.5% in a money market account but is no longer.

*If you had a 90% cash portfolio right now and already had a very large exposure to stocks in your retirement account would you buy additional stocks? What other choices are there?*

I feel like a portion of my cash is getting burned with every stimulus check going out right now. There are just so many dollars in so many peoples pockets.

I guess this is the reason we are where we are with the stock market. It keeps growing because there is nowhere else to go with our money.

Side note: I have started to use the cash in my account to sell cash covered puts on stocks that I like. It is at least something I can do with it. We will see where that leads.

BONUS QUESTION: Have we always had FOMO eating at us like we do nowadays? I feel like everyone is making money hand over fist buying digital coins and NFTs while I just sit on a depreciating asset that nobody even wants anymore."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Yes I'd invest it.  You can get the money out in like two days should you need it.

03/13/2021,stocks,"Heads up, cryptocurrency (BTC in particular) isn't a ""buy low, sell high"" goofy stock anymore. 

A number of **crypto tokens are now being recognized as a collateralizable property asset, and can be squeezed for investment cash** without selling or owing taxes. When you hold it in digital savings & loan services like Nexo or BlockFi (who handles custody for Fidelity Digital Assets, Fidelity's digital collateral investment wing), you can also earn 5-6% interest by keeping it in an account, paid out in BTC anytime you're not using it as collateral.

Google the words ""Digital Asset Collateral"" and check it out. BTC is being used as a serious investment asset now by long term holders like Microstrategy, and presumably Tesla, but 99% of retail traders in /r/bitcoin and /r/cryptocurrency still think it's a buy-low-sell-high stock to sell their way out of when the price is 'high enough.' 

To me, that volatility just means more cheap digital property for me to accumulate and squeeze for business investment cash I use to expand my small business.

Pulling out cash against the rising value of your crypto is tax free, and if you spend that money on business investments (I'm a 'sole proprietor' on my taxes), using your crypto holdings' on-paper ""unrealized gains"" that way will actually *reduce* your end-of-year tax liability.

There is a permanently limited number of bitcoin units that will ever exist, and this 'digital asset collateral' thing was only put into practice in maybe the last 4-6 years, and has really only become a multi-billion dollar buisness in the last year or so.

That's a big part of why the value of BTC is expected to rise over time. The amount in 'retail' hands is going down long term. It's likely going to be held in investment bank vaults and used as appreciating collateral for instant investment cash as time goes on.

**If the value of your BTC goes up while you have cash borrowed (typically at <1-10% yearly interest), you can either take back some of your BTC to use elsewhere, or pull out more cash** (without ever having made any payments towards the original loan or interest)."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Before I go into the details below, I'll just say that a lot of what I'm going to touch on is covered better over a [r/Bogleheads](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bogleheads/) , see the resources for that sub.

There is an old saying ""Time in the market beats timing the market"". So, yes, you should be fully invested and the cash sitting in your brokerage account isn't making you any money.  If you're really worried about timing the market,  you should read about [Bob, the worlds' worst market timer](https://awealthofcommonsense.com/2014/02/worlds-worst-market-timer/).

As far as the undercurrent of your question, as far as is stocks the right investment vehicle, the answer is yes.   Or more accurately a well-diversified portfolio with an appropriate mix of stocks and bonds for your age and goals is the right vehicle.    There have been periods where the stock market hasn't done well, and periods where it's much better but on average it's been around 8% of returns.   Even after a crash, the market has always come back within a couple of years.     This is where part of your consideration needs to be how long before you need the funds, as if you're 65 and about ready to retire you may want to be mostly in bonds, and if you're 21 you might not need any.

One other note:   Winners rotate.   See [The Callan Periodic Table of Investment Returns](https://www.bogleheads.org/w/images/d/dc/Callan_Periodic_Table_of_Investment_Returns.png).  For example, over the past \~6 months, you would have been better off with 70% value and 10% growth.   What is the right mix for the next 6 months?  If someone tells you they know for sure, they're lying to you.   That's why I typically just buy something broad-market such as VTI (US) and VXUS (international) so I'm always well-invested in whatever is actually growing."

I think you could increase REIT exposure. You'd be surprised to hear many of them are growing. Some use them as bond replacements--I disagree, they're definitely equities."
03/13/2021,stocks,It’s a bad thing if you need to withdraw the money ever for any reason. People reduce their exposure mainly for liquidity reasons. If you’re a thousand percent certain you won’t need the money then yolo.

03/13/2021,stocks,"Being too heavily into stocks can be a risk if you're nearing retirement since they're more volatile than bonds, but other than about a decade (about 5 years prior to 5 years after) my understanding is that higher stock exposure means higher returns and better odds of a successful retirement (meaning you don't run out of money).

03/13/2021,stocks,"Like others have said, solid state for EVs.  Ammonia and Hydrogen are viable contenders for the stationary market, but for hydrogen you need a water supply.  Every battery chemistry has particular characteristics though, so it really will likely depend on the load.  I’ve also heard about experimenting with gravity-based energy storage.

Also the flow battery has been around for a while and no ones ever really been able to get it to take off.  I tried to out a project together with one 10 years ago.  They take a lot of space."
03/13/2021,stocks,QS is a Bill Gates backed venture that has had ups and downs to say the least.  They are 3-5 years out as I understand but had a recent breakthrough with stacked wafers or some science shiz like that.

03/13/2021,stocks,"Flow batteries haven't taken off due to their low energy density and additional mechanical complexity (pumps can and do fail).

If energy density REALLY doesn't matter then there's always gravity storage. Move mass higher above sea level and lower it back down. In theory it's simple, cheap, and almost infinitely scalable. In practice it hasn't taken off.

Same with fly wheel storage (density & safety risks), solar thermal (some uptake, but it's not challenging li-ion anytime soon), hydrogen (may see future acceptance in shipping or aviation, but it's not taking over light transport), ammonia, biodiesel, etc.

In practice only pumped hydro and lithium ion have the economies of scale to succeed in the near to mid-term. Solar thermal may see some growth near the equator and hydrogen could eventually work too but not until renewables are cheap enough that massively overbuilding it and using excess capacity for electrolysis isn't a problem."
03/13/2021,stocks,what is tesla using. simplified answer.
03/13/2021,stocks,"Solid state is the holy grail, IMO, but it's probably at least 5 years away before it's good enough to replace lith-ion. It's such a holy grail it's turned out to be snake oil in some cases. Lith-ion has its downsides but it's not going anywhere any time soon, solid state is for sure coming.

Lots of mentions of Quantumscape, which seems widely regarded as the leader in solid state but a couple EV companies to consider.

Fisker's $FSR solid state ambitions do appear to be legit, even though the CEO made a bit of an overpromise when he thought they were close enough to launch EVs with solid state a couple years ago. They later got into legal troubles with QS when it was discovered Fisker's lead researcher had hired a former QS employee to get intel. It looks like Fisker handled the situation appropriately, but moving forward could obviously be legally sticky for them. That said, I think they're a promising enough new EV manufacturer to be worth looking into and if they do end up pulling off their own solid state battery developments, that would be a heaping bowl of extra gravy.

Rivian, which is the like shining new star of the EV industry might IPO as early as the fall and is hiring for solid state research. I'd sell organs for Rivian shares regardless, but they have an obscene amount of cash and are a powerful talent magnet. Their first three models, one of which is the new Amazon van, all launch within months of each other starting with the first US lith-ion pickup in June, which is pretty badass for a new EV startup."

But other than the big private venture capital funds like Atlantic, Sequoia, and Vision Fund I think were a ways off from those being available for investment. Definitely a ways off before its just an available equity."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Yeah they really are only economical at large scale.  Even for a smaller industrial application I couldn’t make it work.  It might pencil out now.  But people know lithium.  LiFePO4 is the preferred chemistry for stationary at the moment.  Lithium NMC is most common in cars.

Do you think it'll get cheaper in the future due to the chip shortage?

 I figured if it drops 50% worst case is I can buy more shares for 1/2 price.  Not that I'm expecting a 50% drop, but I wouldn't mind I guess."

03/13/2021,stocks,I own 7 shares of Asml at about 450 average share price. Right now I have a limit order for 5 shares set to buy any dip that makes it below 482.
03/13/2021,stocks,"Buy while it’s still down from its all time or 52 week highs, whichever is applicable. A good rule of thumb I use is once you get to 5-10% down from those levels, start to build a position. I personally don’t think it will get cheaper because of the shortage, if anything that is a positive for them because increased demand = higher prices which means more money (we are already seeing chip companies raising prices such as NVDA), but the dope part is the $30 something billion that is going towards addressing the shortage, so when those supply chains open up you now have enough supply to meet huge demand with higher prices, which equals big bucks. Now since ASML is more on the supplier side of things this especially benefits them because now all of those companies that rely on them will be buying even more from them.

I'd read all that, Draftkings is not profitable, just making more than right amounts to reach profitability in a few years. Like many growth stocks, they are spending on growing. Primarily marketing, which has been successful:

""In addition to our year-over-year pro forma revenue growth of 42%,  DraftKings recorded an increase in monthly unique payers of 64% to over 1 million, demonstrating the effectiveness of our data-driven sales and  marketing approach.""

Their most common rake for their daily fantasy games is 10%. They rake in more profits every NFL milly maker tournament than the one person out of 500,000+ entries who wins first place and a million dollars. Oh yeah, and they just added their sportsbook this year, already in at least 11 states, while already having the namebrand recognition."

2021-03-13 01:22:07,stocks,"Selling Call Options (Passive Income) For those of you who sell calls with the sole intention of making money, what stocks do you do this with? Do you guys like this more than dividend stocks? And do you guys like selling call options with volatile stocks or relatively consistent stocks? Thanks in advance to anyone who sees this!"
03/13/2021,stocks,">Do you guys like this more than dividend stocks? 

I do both. Pick a good dividend stock that trades sideways or slightly bullish. Sell monthly covered calls against those shares. I go 45-60 days out, far OTM where I don't really worry about having to buy to close or stress about the shares getting called away.  Contract expires worthless and I pocket the premium.

I have a couple 10% dividend stocks I do this with and the yield is about 22% return on just the calls. I can't keep it up forever I'm sure but it works for me for now.

It's not as fun or exciting as buying calls on volatile stocks but it's a lot lower risk. Get rich slowly.

You won't catch me selling naked calls in a million years."
03/13/2021,stocks,"As someone looking to do this, have not yet, my digging/observance has led me to believe that choosing relatively more consistent stocks make for an easier time picking strikes:dates just enough OTM so that they don't get exercised. Whether you wanna choose a penny stock or anything else is your call. Just consider a more stable one. For instance, selling calls on GME would not be an entirely enticing idea considering the wild volatility. Not to mention i could never afford to do so id exercised lol id try something like GE tho, or some pharma like atossa"
03/13/2021,stocks,"I sell covered calls on a lot of my positions. It’s dividend on steroids but it’s way harder than it looks if you’re not looking to sell.

You can get burned really fast. The safest way I do weekly cc’s is I try to open my position on Thursday and I choose 10-18% OTM strikes. You’d be surprised how fast your OTM call can get ITM within 1-2 days. The payout is way lower but they still blow away any dividend stock.

I only do it on growth stocks, the risk/reward of selling on dividend stocks isn’t worth it.

My main advice is whatever strike you choose that you think is safe, add 2 levels on top of it and never sell around earnings or around psychological numbers ending in a 0 or 5 unless the strike is at the 10-18% thresh hold"
03/13/2021,stocks,"I sell covered calls on shares I am holding long term but still have decent IV, like AMD and AAPL. Covered calls are good additional source of income and they reduce your delta exposure, thus, reducing risk at the cost of limited upside exposure. If you have a margin account, you might be better off selling ITM puts. Since put/call parity implies long 100 shares and selling OTM calls is equivalent to sell ITM puts, and you can deploy your cash to other trade. I am also using LEAPs to create PMCC. For example, 2023 Jan SPY 300C is currently selling at $100, so you can spend $10,000 to control 100 shares that barely have any time premium with delta close to 1, and sell calls against them. SPY monthly 6% OTM calls are around $200, so in this case, you are making 200/10000 per month whereas if you hold 100 shares, you are making 200/40000, so much better return on capitals"
03/13/2021,stocks,"Selling calls is not passive income. To do it successfully, you need work, sometimes hard work, and it can be stressful. It could be a great strategy for some people, but make no mistake, it’s not passive."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Just dipping my toes in this strategy recently. Been making small pocket change here and there...honestly I would just go with ones that are popular and will likely remain high in volume for years to come... like maybe apple...PLTR...NIO(?), TQQQ, SOXL... honestly there's alot of good ones.. obviously depends on your budget too 

Tesla would be great for weekly covered calls if you have the money for 100 shares"
03/13/2021,stocks,"Pick a stock with weekly options at a decent price, then every week either buy an OTM strike that stock won’t hit, or pick an ITM strike if you’re done with the stock and want to go away on Friday. 

Edit: forgot, if you’re stock loses volatility the premium goes down, so might need to find new targets every now and then, unless you like a constant $7 a week NOK is a good choice never really moves from $4 for long.

Example: I did a cover call on EXPI 3/19 47.5c Friday morning was able to get stock price minus premium to 4478 total cost, so on 3/19 as long as the stock is over 47.5 I will profit $272 for doing nothing but holding. If it goes under 47.5 I keep the stock/ premium, and can make additional profit by selling the stock or selling another call."

(I use fidelity)

If the option gets exercised, does fidelity immediately remove the shares from my account, and pay me for the shares sold, or do I have to personally go into my account and sell them?

My mind was at  naked calls while I was writing about covered. 👍🏼"
03/13/2021,stocks,">It's really simple to understand. Selling calls is a way to get steady income much like buying a dividend stock is. They are two solutions to the same question. 

I don't know if you are joking or if you're being serious, but I'll assume you don't know what you're talking about. Nothing about selling calls is ""steady income"". As a matter of fact, nothing in the stock market gives you a ""steady income"". Not even the S&P which has corrections, nor dividends (a company can decide not to give dividends further/goes bankrupt/etc). I don't know what land you come from, and if the stock market is that easy for you, maybe you're smarter than all of us. Power to you. 

>It's really not risky at all. Worst case scenario you sell the stock for less then you could have. Unless of course you are talking about selling naked calls which with two seconds of reading the OPs post you would know is not being considered.

You first need the capital to buy the stock shares in the hundreds. You need people to buy your calls. I don't see what he said in regards of not selling naked calls but whatever."
03/13/2021,stocks,"I think I did. Sorry you don't think so?

It has fluctuated between $280 and $230 for the past 6 months, with few valleys in between, and has since steadily declined to $136 since mid February. 

The earnings appear to still look solid, though some of the falloff has been related to covid being attacked, vaccine released, and the push to have society return to normal.  

So I'm curious if $136 is looking as a buy at this moment or more of a normal balanced price for the future, whereas the higher prices were more because our country was in the worst part of the pandemic maybe compared to now. 

Is there an opinion one way or another on this one?"

03/13/2021,stocks,"> Worst case scenario it starts trading at around $40 again

The play was buying under $15-20 last year.   CCL has **massively** diluted their shares.  They could definitely break $40 on hype, but certainly not on fundamentals.    

I like it under $20, but buying after a 50% run up in a month with cruises not restarting for at least three more is risky.  CCL could be a sell the news type event when cruises actually restart.  They will for sure lose billions again in 2021 too."
03/13/2021,stocks,"I held long positions on CCL, RCL, and NCLH from \~March 2020 - \~January 2021.  I no longer have any positions.

I closed them due to risk.  Before, they were over-sold.  Now, they are, at the very least, a lot closer to fair value.

I think right now is the most critical time for the cruise industry.  They already diluted.  They already took on more debt.  They already scrapped their older boats which they were probably going to scrap soon anyways.  It's go time now.  They need to start sailing and start generating cash immediately.

So, I think if you can stomach the risk and are willing to stay with them for a few years, they could continue to be great investments.  However, if the vaccine does not work, or if the virus mutates, or if they keep delaying the start of sailing, or if the middle-class is too broke to vacation, etc ...  I don't think these companies can endure another 6+ month beating."

03/13/2021,stocks,In a bull market with so many potential runners I’d steer clear. Just takes one strain not controlled by a vaccine or one breakout to send this stock back to $10. Not worth the slow climb to $40. Shouldn’t rocket past that as it’ll take years for them to recover financially

03/13/2021,stocks,I shorted but what you said above was why that was a mistake.

There are also warrants, convertible debt, private placements, lots of ways to buy in at a discount."

03/13/2021,stocks,"Another reason is the majority of the stocks sold on the market day to day are not sold by the company, but by investors.

2021-03-13 00:34:46,stocks,"FireEye (FEYE) vs. Crowdstrike (CRWD) Hi all,

I’m trying to make sense of the valuations of these two companies. I’m curious as to why Crowdstrike’s market cap is roughly 9x as high as FireEye’s even though FireEye’s quarterly revenue and EPS is slightly higher than Crowdstrike’s? 

I hold CRWD and understand that it is an overvalued high growth stock, but what other justification is there that should make it 9x more valuable than FireEye?"
03/13/2021,stocks,"I want to enter this space. I really like crwd, but Id rather etf this sector rather than pick a winner. Im eydballing BUG for this purpose."
03/13/2021,stocks,"FEYE is highly leveraged for a software company with 85% DTE, CRWD has 0 debt.

CRWD has a better profit margin in that they lose less money per sale (and that debt amplifies the loss for equity holders).

On a GAAP basis, CRWD loses less money, -$0.11/share ($199/share price) last quarter vs FEYE -$0.19/share ($20.65/share price).  Non-GAAP is funny accounting, a lot of people don't trust it especially when comparing companies."
03/13/2021,stocks,CRWD is part of the growth stock bubble.
03/13/2021,stocks,Crowdstrike’s LTV:CAC ratio is way better than the average for a SaaS company. Like nearly triple it. Our company had a presentation about this ratio and Crowdstrike was easily the best.
2021-03-13 00:28:03,stocks,"Realistic Apple price target 2021? Apple is up 74% in the last year. Clearly it will continue to grow with increasing demands and revenue from all its products. 

What kind of % increases can we expect by the end of this year? The markets look to be thriving at the moment but could inflation fears and rising interest rates have a negative affect on Apple? They have a mountain of cash so I can’t imagine they have much need to borrow money but what’s a conservative price target for Apple by January 2022? 

There’s been a couple of big names calling for 86% increases and $175 price targets. Can’t imagine we stay in the 120s much longer considering we hit this level over 6 months ago. What do you guys think is realistic?"

03/13/2021,stocks,"Worth noting that they had someone different behind the helm through all those periods. While I don’t think Apple is in trouble in regards to their share price, they have operated much differently (safer) under Cook."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Their actual innovation has been nearly nonexistent lately. Even your examples are 10, 20 , and 30 years ago. What keeps them going is their moat of cash and zombies that'll keep buying their products."

03/13/2021,stocks,I’m not going to be disappointed because I’m not banking on it. And I said while people are still  in a mania over EV. Money is getting dumped into EV companies that won’t even have a product for a couple years. The market is in crazy days
03/13/2021,stocks,I beg to differ with Apple silicon. The fact that people are comparing this 10W SoC to top of the line Ryzen desktop chips is insane.
03/13/2021,stocks,Definitely. But AAPL is a solid company so it will not fall as much as some others. Still I don't see what justifies almost 70% stock price increase in the last year.

03/13/2021,stocks,Well that’s triple their current market cap...
03/13/2021,stocks,I hope it does lol. Apple at $90 would be a complete steal. Would definitely be buying as much as possible if it hit that.

2021-03-13 00:13:06,stocks,"$BB - This Weeks Recap 3/12/2021 - Technical Analysis.  

Happy Friday everyone!

What a god damn close. Almost hit that $12 mark but couldn't quite squeeze it out, my thanks to all of you beautiful people who bought in the last 15 minutes of trading. 3.2 MILLION shares traded in the last 15 minutes to try and reach that strike price of $12. We still have after-hours to look at, so we may actually close at or above $12. We met our max pain of $10, which is amazing. Up 23% on the week, incredible.

Thank you all for averaging down, and buying the dip. We are going to have A LOT of eyes on us this weekend and next week as well. Keep accumulating, keep holding, and let's keep the momentum up.

Let's take a quick glance at the chart, as well as options for March 19.

We are above the 50-day moving average and have just blown past a golden cross, a bullish signal.

Hourly: RSI screaming overbought. Looking like a retracement imminent.  
Bollinger bands are expanding, this is good, but we are not respecting the bands and are pressuring outside of them. Every time we've overextended the bands we retrace.  
Monday morning we might expect a gap down to correct ourselves but I will remind you that this would be a healthy retracement.  
4-hour: RSI almost overbought. A cool-off may need to happen.  
Bollinger bands slightly beginning to expand and we hugging the top. If we keep hugging the top this is good. The bands didn't get as tight as I wanted but that's okay. This could be a signal we remain moving up.

Daily: RSI smack dead in the center. Very healthy.  
Bollinger bands are contracting more and more. If they keep getting tighter and tighter we may see a massive break out in the coming days.  
4/5 days this week have been green. I like green crayons. They taste the best.  
This is the highest daily volume we've had since March 4th and before that, Feb 25th. I remind you though 3.2 million of those shares came up in the last 15 minutes of trading to try and reach that $12 strike price.

Weekly: RSI slightly to the overbought side but still moderately healthy.  
Bollinger bands are still wide.  
Our first green candle in the last 7 weeks, and it is a big one. The second-lowest weekly volume that we've had since the beginning of the year. This is huge because we don't need volume to move up. This means people are not selling and are accumulating. We know this to be true because of my previous posts of big institutions are buying.

The top 6 funds holding BB based from [https://www.holdingschannel.com/bystock/?symbol=bb](https://www.holdingschannel.com/bystock/?symbol=bb) have all added to their positions in the last month. Hit ctrl + F and find them on [https://fintel.io/so/us/bb](https://fintel.io/so/us/bb) if you want to see. Don't just take my word for it, I'm dumb. DYOD.

Monthly: Fuck you. Not relevant right now. Shut up.

Every whole number ($10.00, $11.00, $12.00, etc for you dingbats) will be a theoretical line of resistance we will need to push through. Each will be somewhat difficult, but not near as hard as the one I have set \~$14.44. This one was the gap-up signal to the upside and was used for the bounce on Jan 28th, acted as support on Feb 1st, and then resistance on Feb 8th. Once this is secured we will need to get past it, retest it as support, and if it acts as support this $BB will absolutely fly.

Options baby, taken from [http://maximum-pain.com/options/bb](http://maximum-pain.com/options/bb) for March 19th, 2021.

Total Open Interest Calls: 198,238  
Total Open Interest Puts: 59,407

Put/Call ratio: 0.29. This is low as fuck and can be considered incredibly bullish. To be bullish, the ratio typically sits below 0.70.

The highest call open interest? 15.00 at almost 24k open contracts, second highest is $20.00 at 20k.  
The highest put open interest - 8.00 with 7k, second is 10.00 with almost 6.5k contracts.

Do I see 8 happening next week? No, I really don't. Are opinions like assholes, everyone has one.  
Could we close at $10 next week? Absolutely possible. We have signs that we could go in either direction.  
Max pain next week is $9. Should be easy, but so is yo momma.

My thoughts for next week? I don't fucking know. I don't have a crystal ball god damn it. Fuck off.

If I was a magician, I'd say it would be green. About the same % as this week but I have confirmation bias and I also beat my weewee to Kim Possible when I was a teenager. Your guess is as good as mine, but I digress. Lots of signals to go either direction.

This is not advice to buy or sell but a mixed bag of what's happening and the opinion of a degenerate. I love lamp.

Take care."

03/13/2021,stocks,"BB has potential to be disruptor on market. To me that's good bet. My only mistake was thinking entry at 13 was good idea. At that point it already dropped enough and started somewhat to stabilize, when in reality it gone further in upcoming week and two. Would felt lot more confident buying at 10. But it is what it is.   

Good luck."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Yeah, the whole “long” position doesn’t really align with the constant obsession over share price changes day to day and the pumping that goes on here. The DD is pretty suspect as well"
03/13/2021,stocks,"Well I was planning to hold at least a year and average down on the way but if it lifts off within a month, I ain't getting mad."
03/13/2021,stocks,I solid $17 BB.TO calls. I hope not yet.
03/13/2021,stocks,IKR why can't BB just consolidate around $20 instead of $10

03/13/2021,stocks,It’s illegal to get into a group and make a decision about a stock. You can agree with DD but you can’t all plan as a “we” or group to manipulate price.
03/13/2021,stocks,You brave soul. Good luck my friend.
03/13/2021,stocks,"the same way people buy call options you can sell call options if you own the underlying shares. A covered call is when you own at least 100 shares of a stock and you sell the option for someone to buy those shares at a specified strike price. So for example a $20 call expiring March 19th sells for $13, so someone is buying the option to purchase your shares for $20 per share but that option expires next Friday. So if the stock goes above $20 by next Friday they can still only pay $20 per share but if it doesn't go above $20 by next Friday it expires worthless and you keep the $13 and your shares. $13 doesn't seem like much but if you did that every week for a year that is $676. If you are unfamiliar with how options work I would recommend watching a youtube video or read up on how covered calls work. I'm not giving financial advice or telling you what to do, and you should definitely research options more before you get involved with them

edit wow my first award thanks everyone"
03/13/2021,stocks,"Not OP, but I wrote a summary comment here about it: https://old.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lbwsxu/old_fart_advice_for_young_investors/gly798b/"
03/13/2021,stocks,Careful. I was doing this and had it set a 11 strike this week. I'm pretty sure I just sold 300 shares but I guess I'll find out Monday? I've never had one called in so I'm not sure when it gets filled.
03/13/2021,stocks,"Exercised at an early price?
 
I assume you mean if the choose to go through with it when it's out of the money. In this case, they'd be paying more per share than actual market value, so you'd be pocketing their premium and the additional moneu on top of the share's value.
 
You'd be making out like a bandit. No one would ever do this."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Youre limiting profits, not losing money. They hurt very similar but there's a distinct difference."
03/13/2021,stocks,"If someone wants to pay me $20 per share for a stock that is trading for $12 a share thats fine by me, I'll just go back and buy my shares on the open market for $12 again. You want to sell the option at a strike price you don't actually think it will hit by the expiration date."
03/13/2021,stocks,"I'm not a financial advisor and you should absolutely do research before you do anything with options. You would need to contact your broker to enable options trading and how you execute the trade depends on the trading platform, but I'm sure their are tutorial videos on youtube. Spend some time learning how options work before you enable options trading"
03/13/2021,stocks,"just youtube ""selling covered calls on X, ""x"" being the platform you use to trade on. I would highly recommend studying up before diving into options...there is alot to learn!"
03/13/2021,stocks,Someone else asked this question and I don't personally sell calls for less than I paid for the shares. He specifically was saying he paid $20 per share so I was saying a person could sell weekly calls at $20. In order for that call to be executed the price would have to go from $12 to over $20 in one week so worst case scenario he gets paid the same price he paid + the premium. As of the time I wrote this a $20 call on BB expiring March 19th sells for $13 (the price of options is calculated per share so in this case $0.13 but each contract is 100 shares =$13 per contract). which doesn't seem like much but over the course of a year adds up. I'm not giving you financial advice you should research options and how they work before enabling them on your account. Covered calls are just a way to make weekly income on shares you already own
03/13/2021,stocks,BB is a ten year hold. Youll thank yourself once in a couple years. In at 13.5 after averaging down.

I'm not sure what the best play is, maybe if you're a BB bull youd rather just hold to guarantee you capture all the upside. My perspective is gonna be different cuz I'm in a different headspace/strategic...mode...thing. whatever you decide to do good luck!"
03/13/2021,stocks,"I'd say sell the covered call soon. BB is on a rip, lot of interest, IV is high, so premiums are spiking. Good time to sell a further OTM call. See how it is going Monday for sure though."
03/13/2021,stocks,Nice of you to take the time to explain to another. I see you! 🙏🏼
03/13/2021,stocks,Great explanation on covered shares and hedging! Much appreciated!
03/13/2021,stocks,"ELI5 version:

You sell a ticket that's a reservation to buy a 100 shares at a specific price.

The ticket has an expiration date.

If the price of the shares go over the specific price before the ticket expires, the ticket holder can use it to buy the shares at that price.
You keep the money from selling the ticket and the money from selling the shares at that price. So you miss on profit if the shares are worth more.

If the ticket expires you keep the ticket money and the shares."
03/13/2021,stocks,">d will be for the foreseeable future lol

This finally makes sense.  So if stock goes up, they pay the strike price and you lose out on tendies from owning the stock (SP above strike) \* 100 shares and the premium that the ""buyer"" paid.  If it goes down, collect premium and repeat."
03/13/2021,stocks,"And if u do this dont expect the Price to rise ur stock,"
03/13/2021,stocks,Can you do this from a Roth IRA?
03/13/2021,stocks,But even if they dont hit strike price they can still call in the contract right? Pretty sure thats what my broker disclaimer says.  So if you bought high and hope it doesnt get called in it still could and then you take a big loss right
03/13/2021,stocks,Yea its gone. You'll get $11 a share though
03/13/2021,stocks,"I think he meant an in the money option that was lower than your cost. My cost basis was around 11.70, but I can't sell a call for 11.50 in the same week so I sold one for $11

I probably should have sold it at a $12 but now I'm out.

Not a ton, but I think that's what they ment."
03/13/2021,stocks,I meant my BB price is 18 but my CC strike is 15
03/13/2021,stocks,I bought BB at 18 but I'm selling covered calls for 15 strike. If they get exercised then I'm out 3k
03/13/2021,stocks,"Sorry, what I meant is what if you're average price is higher than your covered call price? Then you're losing money no? I have BB at 18 but my CC strike is 15."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Nah, at that point you sell a put to buy the shares. Collect premium AND get shares. Keep the wheel rolling"
03/13/2021,stocks,">Someone else asked this question and I don't personally sell calls for less than I paid for the shares.

You said he can sell covered calls for now. I replied basically saying exactly this. You shouldn't sell calls for less than you paid for the stock though, and $20 calls are super cheap. Not sure what prompted you to think I needed an explanation on what call contracts are..."

03/13/2021,stocks,"you get the money from selling the shares + the contract, so If you sell a contract with a $20 strike price you get paid $2000 + the premium in this case $13"

03/13/2021,stocks,Best explanation I’ve ever heard.
03/13/2021,stocks,Exactly I make more money selling covered calls then on dividends
03/13/2021,stocks,"I don't know you should ask your broker, I just do this from my trading account. You would need to contact your broker anyway just to enable options. Its a good idea to read up on how options work before doing anything."

03/13/2021,stocks,"Oh in that case yea unless you can sell the call for $3.00 or more.

You'd only be out 300 not 3k though, unless you sell 10 calls"
03/13/2021,stocks,I try to only sell calls for more than what I paid for them originally. You can obviously make a higher premium for selling closer to the current price but you risk the price going up and someone actually calling away your shares. Thats one reason I like selling them on a weekly basis and for higher price. I don't get as high of a premium but I don't actually want my shares called away. I read somewhere close to 90% of options expire worthless so I would rather sell options than buy them
03/13/2021,stocks,I mean selling puts is also a way to make money. People should do research on options before even enabling them on their account.
03/13/2021,stocks,"because people seem to be asking a lot of basic questions and some of this stuff can be confusing to people, for example how options are priced. I remember when I first talked to my brother about selling covered calls he said ""but thats only $0.15"" and I had to explain that the price is per share and each contract is 100 shares. $13 does seem like much but if a person purchased 100 shares of BB for $1200 and sold weekly calls at a $20 strike price for $13 that is $676 a year on a $1200 investment. The person who originally mentioned purchasing shares at $20 obviously would have paid $2000 for 100 shares but even then a $600 annual profit  on a $2000 investment is pretty good to me. I'm not giving financial advice you can chose to do whatever you want with your money"

03/13/2021,stocks,"Well it wouldn't be smart to use the ticket to buy shares at 20 when they're worth 15 right now.

The bet is that you don't think the shares are gonna go over the price by the date and the ticket buyer bets that if the shares moon then they have a way to get the shares for cheaper and turn a profit.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFiIDopDqhQ"
03/13/2021,stocks,"If the strike price of a call is above the share price, it most likely won't be executed. So the option expires worthless, meaning the buyer lost the premium and the seller keeps it.

So as a example, you sell a call at a $20 strike at a premium of $0.50 that expires March 26th. At the end of the day on the 26th, BB is trading at $17. The buyer doesn't exercise their option to buy the seller's 100 shares at $20, so it expires and you keep the $0.50 premium, which $0.50 * 100, means you earn $50.

The seller can buy to close their sold option before the expiration date to avoid selling shares at the strike or to secure profits."
03/13/2021,stocks,"They have the option to buy the shares but not the obligation. You get paid the premium as soon as you sell the call, and if the contract expires worthless you keep the premium and keep your shares."
03/13/2021,stocks,Then strike at 18 then?
03/13/2021,stocks,I have 1080 shares and sold 10 calls.  :/
03/13/2021,stocks,Ah shiet. Yeah but the premiums for 18 were absolute trash. They were something like 70 bucks. I pay 20 in comissions so its not really worth it

03/13/2021,stocks,What does that mean (from a someone trying to understand options)? Since it is below $300 today does that mean he has less than 90k?
03/13/2021,stocks,Exactly and theirs a lot of rookies playing really dumb odds.
03/13/2021,stocks,"Its all good, I understood what you were saying but for people who have never traded options before I could see the wording being a little confusing. Anyone who is reading any of this should research options before they even enable it on their account."
03/13/2021,stocks,I only had 300. I knew the risk but I only got .23 per share at 11.
03/13/2021,stocks,Premiums were kinda bad
03/13/2021,stocks,"You should be able to buy to close on the options if you really don't want to sell at the strike price. Also the buyer's breakeven price is strike price + premium, so if it's still trading under the breakeven price but over the strike, the buyer might choose to let the option expire. IV is high for BB right now, so if IV and the share price goes down a bit, so you might be able to close your CCs at a decent price."
03/13/2021,stocks,Your broker charges you $20 commissions? I recommend checking out Fidelity

03/13/2021,stocks,"Because the option contract predicted the price would be at or over $300, and it wasn't, that contract is worthless. The person initially paid $90k for those contracts. It's like buying a really expensive scratch off ticket and winning 0$."
03/13/2021,stocks,then that's the risk you take.
03/13/2021,stocks,Hmm okay. They expire April 9th. I guess ill take my chance with them. You think BB will hit 15 by then?
03/13/2021,stocks,Yeah i know but its such a bitch to transfer all my accounts. This is in Canada too so its a pain to transfer all my registered accounts
03/13/2021,stocks,"No clue honestly. Personally I’d say it fucking better, but with earnings on the 31st, it’s hard to predict short term. April 9th is decently far away so you might have good chance to close at a acceptable price and good earnings could mean a big sell off and dropping the price."
03/13/2021,stocks,But they are charging you $20 for every trade? I'm in the US so I don't know how that works in Canada but I transferred my account to a different broker and it took a week and unless its on a foreign exchange it $0 fee
2021-03-13 00:10:25,stocks,"Confused, Why does the NASDAQ go down when the 10 year treasury yield goes up? I'm confused as to why the NASDAQ go down when the 10 year treasury yield goes up. I thought it was disposed to be a good thing.  

According to Investopedia they say:

> **Why Is the 10-Year Treasury Yield So Important?**    
>  
>The importance of the 10-year Treasury bond yield goes beyond just understanding the return on investment for the security. The 10-year is used as a proxy for many other important financial matters, such as mortgage rates.    
>  
>This bond also tends to signal investor confidence. The U.S Treasury sells bonds via auction and yields are set through a bidding process. When confidence is high, prices for the 10-year drops and yields rise.  This is because investors feel they can find higher returning  investments elsewhere and do not feel they need to play it safe.   
>  
>But when confidence is low, bond prices rise and yields fall, as there is more demand for this safe investment. This confidence factor is also  felt outside of the U.S. The geopolitical situations of other countries can impact U.S. government bond prices, as the U.S. is seen as safe haven for capital. This can push up prices of U.S. government bonds as demand increases, thus lowering yields.  

&#x200B;

Can some one please explain this to me in simple terms? I'm don't know much about bonds."
03/13/2021,stocks,The real answer is DCF. The 10 year yield sets the discount rate. A higher yield = lower discounted cash flows. Particularly harmful to Nasdaq long duration earnings stocks which have low present earnings yields. If you’re buying stock in an unprofitable company based on future earnings projections you will be in a world of hurt if 10yr yield keeps going up.
03/13/2021,stocks,"There's big tech such as in the QQQ and the ITK etfs. Then there's speculate tech as in some of the Ark etfs. 
The former may still do well with raising interest rates, the latter will struggle over the short to medium term."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Rates rising means it will cost more for a company to borrow. So this directly eats into a companies earnings that they report. So the price to earnings ratio (PE) needs to be corrected to be in line with what is viewed as fair value when rates rise. 

Now it’s even harder when you have no earnings because it directly effects the ability to grow. Because it cost more to borrow. So those companies will grow at a slower pace or have to consistently issue more stock.

Tech trades at the highest PEs in the market by far. It needs to borrow to grow into those projections. Especially after the past year. Combine that with the theory that these companies growth will slow, out of a pandemic.... you get the past month."
03/13/2021,stocks,Equity risk premium (the premium stock investors demand in order to buy the security as compensation for risk) falls as risk-free rate (10-year treasury yield) rises. Inversely proportional relationship.

03/13/2021,stocks,"First part right but i think if interest rates go up it hurts bonds because you can get a good return without tying up you money.  

What I want to know is how the bond rates go up when they are sold at auction and bidding drives the return down.   After being so low, like .8% for a while, nobodies wanted them and are probably a smaller portion of everyone's portfolio than they usually are.  The market is so high I'm sure a lot of people are bidding on them.  Could it be an increase in supply because I can't imagine a decline in demand when so many stocks have doubled and tripled in the last couple of years.  

What determines the volume of bonds the treasury issues?  Could an increase in supply be driving up returns?  Could the whales be creating a safe haven for a crash so they don't have to settle for 4% this year and jump back in when it hits bottom?  I think the only risk would be a significant jump in interest rates that prevent them from selling the bonds to move back into the market and that shit isn't happening anytime soon.  Does some metric determine the volume?  Or some fat cats?"
03/13/2021,stocks,"People aren't moving their money to bonds. They're moving them to safer companies. That is why the DOW will sometimes have a good day when the NASDAQ tanks.

03/13/2021,stocks,"$20K to meme stock YOLOs. This is a significant chunk of money for me. Fortunately I got lucky and invested in the recent dip and I'm up slightly now. But boy did that first hit HURT. Like another poster on here, I lost nearly $10K in 10 seconds by investing at the exact wrong time and my market order executed at an insanely high price and instantly dropped back down.

I learned:

To have patience. This was key to sound decision making.

Use limit orders.

To ignore my feelings of FOMO, especially with the second coming of meme stocks.

To spend a lot of time researching the companies I invest in.

Hold conviction stocks during a dip, but learn to cut losses on a failing trade."
03/13/2021,stocks,i should probably hurry up and learn some lessons while i dont have that big of a portfolio lol
03/13/2021,stocks,"Fortunately only a few hundred so far.

No one should be dumping thousands into the market without knowing what they're doing first. This is obvious even to a beginner such as myself.

I currently have two positions I've made a bit on, and about half a dozen that I've lost on. It's allowed me to look back at where I bought in at and realize ""wow that was really dumb""

My current plan is to set a few limit orders if anything spikes (shooting for between 10 and 30%) and spend the next few weeks learning technical analysis. During that time I'm going to pick a few stocks, pretend to buy in at a certain point, and then track them to see how I would have done.

My goal is to be making trades with confidence within 6 months. I'll then set goals and see how I do."
03/13/2021,stocks,"I was young, cocky, and making money. With my shiny new economics degree, I thought I was invincible. Tried dipping my toe in some sectors that were way outside of my understanding, relying on the advice of others, and got crushed to the tune of 10k.

Best thing that could've happened to me. I quickly realized you get out of this racket what you put into it. Like everything else in life, if you want to make something of it, you have to put in time and effort. Learning core fundamentals, researching companies and financial information, it takes time. You can only ride on luck for so long, and at some point it absolutely will bite you in the butt."
03/13/2021,stocks,Sigh. Maybe 200K from options. 😭
03/13/2021,stocks,"I FOMO’s in the first day of an IPO without understanding what an IPO was or really anything at all. Rode it up to the peak and thought ‘look at all this free money I’ll be getting forever’ right up until the end of the lock up when the price came crashing down. 

Two years later I’m still down 10% on that stock.

The lesson I’m trying to teach myself is to sell."
03/13/2021,stocks, I took my account from 22k back May 2020 to 160k this past january back to 45k. Like an idiot at a casino the more relatively smart moves I made the more aggressive I got on high leverage moves and lost big on the whole Lucid/churchill meltdown followed by growth and SPAC demolition. Lesson is to bet only on high conviction picks but don't throw the house at any one thing and secure profits
03/13/2021,stocks,"Got started a 1.5 months ago, put in $600, lost 52%. Been growing it since... I'm only down ~20% now. I've positioned myself, I think, to at least have a pretty steady growth if I just f'ing *leave it alone*, yeah :P

That was the best lesson I learned: you'll lose money when you think you can do some ninja stuff."
03/13/2021,stocks,"I learned to do my own investments for entertainment only.  Once the dollars get too large and I start stressing out about things I transfer those assets to my professionally managed account and let my guy take care of it.  So I play stocks for fun and leave the life changing decisions to my advisor.  No FOMO, no YOLO, as fun as it is, retirement sounds much more fun."

03/13/2021,stocks,I bought my first ever option call in RKT for $27 call. Cost me $56 and I checked it and I was up $1800k and I decided to wait it out the 3 days for it to close and I lost $33 dollars instead of cashing out on top. Never again. I’m still learning options and have made a few dollars off smaller ones this week. I learned I can’t be greedy anymore and realize when to sell. Diamond hands aren’t for everything lol

03/13/2021,stocks,30k on a put. Huge gains first week. Then plummeted next week. -30% one day. Sold all cause I got scared. Stock plummeted next day. Bought back into my puts. Stock jumped again.

03/13/2021,stocks,"**The Lesson of not doing anything at all.**

I worked a 100% travel job, which did not typically have online connectivity.  I had saved up about $20,000, kept 10,000 in savings and put the other $10,000 in an SEP account with Merrill Edge.  I was doing alot of investor education online, but was afraid to jump in. I didn't want to make a mistake not understanding the risk. In the meantime, I did not have internet for a month at a time.

I finally settled on a mutual fund and put $2,500 in, but it took me 4 months to get to this point. I watched it go up, up, and up fairly quickly. Another 8 months goes buy and I finally feel confident enough to buy more. I spread the rest out to QQQ, 1 other mutual fund, and I bought a stake in CSX and JPM as my first sole stock purchases.

Everything did well for about 6 months and then the market simmered for about 8 months before continuing to do well.

I use Merrill Edge as my broker and it generates a nice graph that compares all of your account holding (including non-invested cash) and how it stacks up against an index.

Years later....If I had just put it all into a simple S&P 500 index ETF initially, without delay, I would be up 180.6%. Instead my initial $10k is up 131.6% from that 1 year delay. I am missing out on gains from compounding interest to this day.

Now this is only from my initial $10k, so I am only out about **$5k** from this. But that was an easy $5k that could be making more money into the future. In 30 years that will be **$38k** if I get an average annual gain of 7%.

7 years later I've saved up more more and my gains in the market are $200k and I've better learned how to mitigate risks and can take the risks of staying ahead of the market and get better gains appropriately.

&#x200B;

Don't make mistakes caused from FOMO in aggressive or risky trades, but **fear doing nothing** with your money.

I would always default to a solid index ETF and then if you are purposefully taking a strategy to remove money from the market to time it, that is fine, but that is an investment decision doing something. Don't do nothing.

**Early education investment advice**:

1) Day 1: Put it all in SPY

2) Day 2-Day 365: Spend as much time reading up investing online as you want; When you're ready sell some of your SPY shares and try something else."

03/13/2021,stocks,"Luckily, my early losses were about $500-1000 for some picks, but they were big for me at the time.

I bought NFLX a while back in 2013 I think and they announced increasing rates and some trouble with expanding overseas... forgot exactly what happened, but I freaked out when it went from 200 something to low 100s.  I jumped ship at the bottom... and of course it came back strong, and bought back in 2 years ago.

Recently, I’ve thrown about 10k into HYLN, about half of that was in tortoise SPAC.  First SPACi tried out, got excited, and now I’m down 5k for my biggest loss in a while.

03/13/2021,stocks,"The first, and ever, time I bought a stock (rather than ETF or mutual fund), it was TDFX.  Yep, 3DFX, the video card company that got swallowed up by NVidia.

I was young, so it was a few months of my savings, but I had a Voodoo 2 video card, and thought I should invest in a company that makes a product I enjoy.

""Set it and forget it"" I told myself.  ""Check on it someday when I need to cash out for a big purchase.""  I had not even looked at it for many, many years, and when I did it was all gone.  I'm not sure what happened to other investors.  I think everyone had a couple weeks, maybe a few months notice, but I was out doing college life and not even caring about markets.

Years later I tried picking a few individual stocks on paper and noticed, all of them would have lost money.  So I stuck to a reliable Vanguard fund and DCA'd for years and was a much happier investor."

I tried to sell during a market halt of the stock bc the price was like $95.00, but because I placed a market order, it executed the shares at $55.00. Not an expensive lesson, but I rarely place market orders now."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Bought EXPI at 72 and NIO at 61 (both pretty much peaks). $5,000 between the two of them. It dropped about 40% in a couple weeks. It’s going back up now, but I’m not sure if I’m learning a “hold through losses and don’t try to time the market” lesson or a “know when to cut your losses” lesson. I feel a bit better about NIO than EXPI.

Maybe the real lesson is “don’t jump in without knowing anything about balancing a portfolio and bet on random growth stocks based on DD on Reddit”

Edit: EXPI was pre-stock split, so I think it was actually 150 I bought it at, or something like that."

I also keep a few sweet divvies on hand to even things out. Or more accurately to keep me from fomo’ing all over my portfolio.

Up $14,323 total but I just started trading regularly in Jan.  I've always averaged down then sold at break even if it didn't go my way immediately.  If it does go my way, I accept any profit.

03/13/2021,stocks,"I’ve probably lost about $500 overall but only started trading properly for a few months (I’m still currently up about $800). The main lesson I’ve learned is:

Don’t buy all the stock you want at once (buy some and then reassess if the market goes up//down) don’t wait to try to sell at the very peak, take profits at different peaks (because you can never time it perfectly), don’t buy on margin if you can’t cover it (got margin called due to an app declining my deposit), and only invest what you can afford to lose (stonks don’t only go up 😕)"

I don't have the patience to learn with a paper account: If I win, I want to win for real.  Luckily, I have the right budget- I started with $300 and have been adding $20 a week.  So I've got $617 in an account that I've only put $360 into.  

I made a bit on Gamestop before it priced itself out of my portfolio, and made a really good move with $RKT.  The rest are pennies, and only one was a dud.  I saw a post on r/pennystocks and bought right away.  I threw in $57 and finally got rid of it for $45.  My first P&D, and I bought at the high for a really cheap, practical lesson.  

 Only one of the rest isn't up, and that's because it's been reliably volatile lately.  If I have to watch it go up and down, I might as well learn how to day trade with it (in a stilted, cash account sort of way).  I'm only into it for $50, so either I'll finally get some growth out of it or I'll learn another fairly inexpensive lesson."

We had a good bull run and just about every stock was having a nice run, so it was easy to think it was always going to be like that..but in reality the stocks i chose that did well were ones that i did a good amount of DD on. I started to just say ""hey, this looks good"" and adding it to my portfolio for no apparent reason, then not having great success. i backed off for a bit, and started doing some actual research into sectors i thought were good, and reinvested and viola, started seeing those nice gains again. Got to do that DD!"

It never recovered and I sold it for a 1500 loss.  All the research, perfect timing and I screwed up at the top of the spike. So lost the 3000 gain and took a 1500 loss. 4500 up in smoke."

Essentially I'm trying to time the market and it worked for me so far. But of course, I can't protect myself from a black swan event.

Around 1pm, I started getting a bunch of notifications from fidelity. Apparently they decided to close all of them. Other brokers (rh, ally) don't begin closing them until 3pm, but my lesson was that fidelity does it earlier. They closed almost all of them for $2.20, the price at close was $8.37, and it was higher 39 minutes before that. Anyways, 240k lesson learned."

Buying expanding companies instead of hyped prices, unless of course its amc/GME/moon stock. Learning to never sell at a loss, and not risking enough that waiting is an issue, not risking hype over solid business. Learning not to expect more than the average, enjoying above average, accepting below target wins. Etc. still have a long way to go but on the right track."

My risky penny stocks tanked even harder at that time and I didn’t sell those extremely speculative ones quickly enough. I bought ICLN/INRG almost at it’s recent peak too and now it just goes down. So far I’ve learned not to listen to family investment advice, d your own DD, diversify, speculative stocks collapse in a correction, careful with stuff hyped on Reddit, and in general - stonks don’t always go up.

The lesson to me is to diversify and don’t bet the farm on any individual stock. Also, don’t put everything into any particular sector. This year I’ve taken a big hit on my electric vehicle stocks, but it is nothing like 2008. Most of my money is in IRAs and I bet smaller these days on individual stocks, never more than 20K."
03/13/2021,stocks,"I don't think giving the lessons a price tag makes any sense without relation to the general budget you're working with. 

But here's one thing I learned for around 5% of my overall capital, not all at once but over the course of some years: If you're in Europe, don't fall for the notion that warrants et al. are just the european equivalent to options and so you settle for them as options are absurdly unpopular/unknown here. They're not. They're intransparent as hell, systematically rigged and risk-wise fundamentally broken products. They're borderline scams and banned for a reason for US citizens (maybe some citation needed here, but it fits the overall picture amazingly well). 

If you want to trade leveraged products, take the extra efforts in taxes, currency conversion etc and use a foreign broker that offers real options. Or do sports bets, blast it all on red, I don't care. Even the shell player behind the bus station offers a better risk-reward ratio than the crap that the institutions are (quite legally lobbied) advertising to you in the EU."
03/13/2021,stocks,I have UWMC and I’m just waiting for it to get to at least $11 ...realized that I shouldn’t invest when the market closes and I tried to cancel my order but the app was being dumb. Also learned Wednesday are the days most stocks do go up.

03/13/2021,stocks,I just got options added to my account. I was researching calls with expirations out 1 year. When I clicked on the order tab it must have reset and I didn’t catch it. Couldn’t figure out why it was so cheap so I bought 15 contracts. My dumb ass accidentally bought 15 contracts expiring in 24 hours way out of the money. $135 lesson learned.
03/13/2021,stocks,"I purchased a stock due to hype and fomo, people were touting the stock to rise 50-70% in the next few days. Shortly after my purchase at an ATH, the stock tanked 70%, where I finally decided to cut my losses. Granted it was only $100, but it still hurt nonetheless and it has taught me to do my DD and never ever fomo."
03/13/2021,stocks,Yeah i probably lost around 2grand jumping in on stocks that were already getting hyped
03/13/2021,stocks,Lost 15k on spy puts
03/13/2021,stocks,"I got killed in penny stocks 20+ years ago.  Listening to Cramer also cost me a lot of money.  My advice is to stay away from penny stocks and do your own research, concentrate on stocks you know and don't get dragged in by pumpers.

I quit stocks completely for over 15 years out of disgust and not wanting to lose any more.  Got back in 2 years ago because Trumps economy was driving the markets up so fast.  I made up my loses from years ago in 2020, I have been carrying $3mil in capital gains loss on my Fed return for over 15 years, so it is now cancelled and mostly tax free, I quit day trading last August and put everything into good stable good dividend paying stocks.  I need to hold until this August to take advantage of Long term Capital gains.  Greed killed me in the past, As the 5 stocks I now hold hit the 1 year mark, I will sell, set for life and limit my future exposure to stocks."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Lost 600 to learn about averaging down, and to not buy in all at once. Lost 400 to learn about selling too early at a loss. Both of those pushed me into learning about long term dividend investing and passive income so I'd say it was worth it."
03/13/2021,stocks,"I did that early on, I couldn't even tell you all the dumb penny stocks I bought, would make like, $20 off, sell thinking I could build up my initial $1000 deposit in 2016 like that. There was one I had a fair bit in, Amyris (disclosure have 453 shares right now), that, due to my work background, I liked the science of, so held it. I did screw up a bit, and my limit-sell triggered back in January, but I still made a nice little profit, which I put into Comcast. (Went from about 900 shares to the current 453). Well darned if Amyris hasn't been taking off lately, so I feel a little salty since I just crossed the $21k mark, but would probably be much closer to $30k if I hadn't taken profits like that.   


I do like Comcast, a lot, but their stock price seems to be cyclical. About every two years they peak, then dip down in what looks like a perfect bell curve, then over 2 years they'll peak again (higher), and then come down. Looks like it's reaching the top of one of those peaks, so I probably should have just held the cash  to buy in lower later on. Whatever, I like dividends."
03/13/2021,stocks,"I've only dabbled in investing at the beginning of 2018, only putting in 10k as markets were at ATH. I had the brilliant idea to time the market so 60k sat in my brokerage in cash earning 0% interest so i can buy in cheap. The kicker is i didnt even watch the market so i missed the 2018 december pull back completely. Then march 2020 came but instead of buying i instead bought leveraged inverse ETFs at the literally bottom of the market on march 23rd and because of sunk cost fallacy I did not go long at all, I kept waiting for the market to crash again so my inverse etf can recover and I'm still in cash to this day. The inverse ETF i only sold last month at a 80% loss for -12k. To add insult to injury, I also had the brilliant idea to sell my parent's investments worth 100k+ when the market recovered cause i thought it was irrational when COVID was still raging. So now  their investments are sitting in cash too.

I have since missed out on over 70k - 80k of gains plus the 12k loss split between me and my parents by this point which is equivalent of 2-3 years of my salary and it is killing me inside. Seeing the recent market melt ups is just a kick in the balls, every massive green day just makes me sicker and sicker to my stomach. I know i shouldn't try to time the market again but i'm still being affected by sunk cost fallacy, i just can't get myself to buy in now when everything has run up so much so fast. I know this sub isn't the place to find pity but I am in a very dark place and having some very dark thoughts."
03/13/2021,stocks,"FOMO and not using buy and sell limits. I'm new to trading so I got caught up in the short term gains frenzy from recent stocks. I don't have a lot of money (3k total) so I lost $20 on a $300 investment. Compared to other people, my lesson is cheap. Right now, my goal is to buy stocks that I expect to grow in 5-10+ years and keep investing little by little during dips."
03/13/2021,stocks,I’ve fucked up too many time buying at market open. Now I buy around noon or at the end of the day. I try to buy on Monday’s and Fridays and sell on Wednesday’s or Thursday’s.
03/13/2021,stocks,"I’m new and just working with a small account I can afford to lose. But feel like I learned an important lesson the other week, lost about $700 on HD Calls:

Did some homework on Home Depot and was feeling pretty confident that it would spike a bit and then fall for a couple weeks around their earnings report late Feb. Plan was to wait for the jump up, then buy a put to ride the post earnings sell off down close to the bottom. 
Well I didn’t see the little spike I was expecting, instead it fell at market open pretty hard, so I impulsively bought a call to ride that little spike back up. The spike happened, I was up $10/share and still expected it to keep going. It fell again. I doubled down on the call, waiting for the “real spike.” And then realized that the spike was over. So at that point I’m holding 2 call options instead of my planned put option, as I watch my original prediction come true and the stock falls for two weeks. My calls expired OTM. 
Two things I learned:  
1) trust my homework, but don’t make up new plans on the fly if things aren’t happening exactly as I expect. Either stick to the plan or don’t get in at all. Don’t make hasty decisions
2) Know ahead of time where to exit your options. If I had a set profit amount to take, I’d have sold and taken a profit, but instead I just kept letting it ride without any real plan to sell. I also now have a deal with myself to sell an option if it falls to 50% of what I paid for it. Better to take a 50% loss than sit waiting and hoping the stock magically climbs back up."
03/13/2021,stocks,"like $500-1000 mostly from the ark funds and a bit of corsair in the last month or two. since then i realized idk what im doing and i just put it all in index funds with a bit in things like disney, bershire hathaway, apple, microsoft and im just not gonna touch it"

03/13/2021,stocks,I lost money once by confidently believing my b/e was $300 lower than it was.
03/13/2021,stocks,"I bought my first stocks in GME this week in an over-leveraged CFD account and stupidly left very little money for my margin. I put $400 in and watched it go up to $2000. In my boneheaded high of gaining so much profit, I decided to buy another 5 shares at $320, literally minutes before the massive sell-off happened. Forgetting to set my stop loss meant all my earnings went straight into the debt of the shares I bought at $320 (The account was leveraged 1:5 and I had very little money to cover my losses)

I'm 18 and $2000 is a lot of money for me. watching such a large sum of money disappear in minutes didn't feel great. I've learned that trading with borrowed money is a pretty bad idea. I know that at the end of the day it was my own greed that cost me that 2 grand."
03/13/2021,stocks,1000$ I bought a penny stock after it tallied from 0.02 $ to 0.38 $. Thinking that it will go up further just becsuse I came up with the stock duggestion alone. And it went back to 0.16$.
03/13/2021,stocks,"Around 10K but it's not all my fault.

I did some trading with my parents back when I was a student (Finance school)

At the time, the internet was just starting to bloom, and people had very little knowledge about bubbles, pump-and-dumps etc. We pretty much ate whatever rumours people were feeding us, and some times it was already too late. Most of the time we benefitted from the overall bull market pushing everything up.

The total damage was about 10K when the market crashed. But we already had lots of materialized gains too. And I have to say that I was lucky enough to live a market crash very early in my life. It was a big awakening moment. And I was very lucky to never like derivatives. I still consider them immoral and dangerous. Especially the way they are pushed to newbies over the phone these days.

We still have 10 stocks from that era. We get a good laugh every time we get a notice from the bank about them :)"

I already didn’t believe in buying weeklies ever, I call them scratch-offs, but it was mid GME height and I was up 386K on Wednesday and was certain the stock would hit 500 by Friday.

I even told my friends the only way these weeklies fail is if they cheat or an environmental/systemic change happens.

Well... it did. Options contracts don’t care about the why, they expire worthless if their terms aren’t worth anything. The 2 contracts I bought for 5K each that were “guaranteed” to be worth 4X that at least did not care about long rambles about the DTC. They simply expired worthless.

I learnt my lesson. If I buy options, they’re long dated and not on a timer. Still a gamble, but they can hold value more effectively when theta is at 0"

Learned the hard way to go far out, stay modest with strikes, be more realistic with gains (>30% return I tend to begin closing to secure some profit or negate losses), and hedge your positions. Never let FOMO drive investment strategy.

Didn’t to me, but I’ve known a couple people who go aggressively bearish on margin. One friend made an aggressive short early COVID and rolled it into deep SPY puts. The rest is is history, but they sucked a >50% loss before closing options. Held the short position paying interest waiting for the market to go back down to close positions. Ended up having to liquidate a lot of their portfolio (all tech stocks that would have earned 100% returns) and clear out savings. Managed to lose nearly a year’s salary (as a software engineer) over three months.

Moral of the story bearish investments can be very dangerous if you don’t know what you’re getting yourself into."

03/13/2021,stocks,"My big lesson was on NIO.  One of my naive ways of learning about the market was surfing Reddit, where I encountered WSB in around early November.  I managed to stay away from any gaming retailers, but one of the big hypes during that time was NIO.  Everyone started buying NIO at market open on one particular day, including me.  At the end of the day it tanked.  A couple of times in the course of several weeks it peeked it's head out over that position.  I could have sold it those couple of times to break even, but nooooo, each time I thought, ""this is it, it's going to keep going.""

03/13/2021,stocks,"I’ve lost about $40,000 over the course of 2 years. What I have learned is:
1) Pull money from stocks at the peak and don’t wait with wishful thinking or willful ignorance for it to get higher or stay high in price. DON’T BE GREEDY because WHAT GOES UP WILL COME TUMBLING DOWN.....F-A-S-T! (It will save you tens of thousands. 😔)
2) Options have higher returns than stocks and the losses are even higher! So, to counteract, purchase a call option and (sell) put option accordingly. Worse case scenario (if I don’t adhere to lesson one) is that I break even and get to keep my original investment, if I have sense enough to get out by then. ($4,270 can disappear in less than 60 seconds. 😔)
3) Don’t try to get all the money! 🙄There’s money EVERYWHERE, ALL THE TIME! And I wind up with nothing, trying to get everything (like in a money-grab machine.)
4) RESEARCH and STRATEGIZE!!! Have a daily, weekly or monthly strategy. (Strategize according to my life schedule and investment portfolio.)
5) While some DD (due diligence) posts are accurate, most are not and are a scam to ‘pump and dump’ leaving me holding a bag with a hole in it. 😕😖😭
6) Don’t get depressed when I incur major losses! It looks and feels like it’s all over. But IT’S NOT! I will learn my lesson(s), come into some more money to invest, become an experienced investor which will make me a multi-billionaire.
7) Easy does it! When I learn stocks, choose the ones (based on volatility) that suits me, stay on track with my strategy and not ‘put all my eggs in one basket’, I make more money faster and lose less. And I set myself up to be open to other great ‘spur of the moment’ money-making stocks with little to no notice beforehand that they’re about to spike in profit.
8) (Explaining the summary at the end of lesson 7.) ALWAYS have some money set to the side just in case I hear a legitimate word on a great stock about to spike in profit! Or at least have a stock I’m willing to immediately drop in order to snatch a greater profit somewhere else. (And then, adhere to lesson 1....snatch and go!) 🤣
9) People behind the scenes tamper with stocks in “legal” ways to cause the stocks to drop dramatically in price. 😡😡😡Don’t get scared and run, leaving all that “lost” money out there!!!! The price will (usually) go back up within a few days or weeks!!! (Thousands of dollars have been lost through ‘market manipulation’. 😡)

You doubled down on a stock that had just tanked over 85% total value. The fact it went up again is pure luck. You could have sat at $50 or worse forever cuz there’s no guarantee this “tech company” revival that Ryan Cohen talks of will pan out. That wasn’t an advisable play because the fundamentals just don’t support the stock, period. Initially, it was a lucky play due to a mistake made by some big billionaire hedge funds. They’ll learn their lesson and next time bury everyone 6 feet under. 

It’ll go down again. That’s my 🌈 🐻 instinct.

That was me this week but only with single and low double digits.  I hope I reach even 10k with my start.
I'm all over the place. Day trade, swing trade, stop.loss, limits, fundamentals,  meme's.
AMC drove me crazy
.got out early with two small wins and avoided GME only b.c I felt like I was late but it rallied and rocketed. I just did not trust it this past week, and, I so so regret not buying it. 

I have 2500 wanting to break through the red with random stocks and I am going to hold.
The other 2k is down by 4% but I'm feeling good about them. 

I think I'll stick to news, some hype, swing and short term for mid gains. My personality thinks he's a day trader but won't execute when needed so, I watch the missed opportunity right in front me...
so, probably not the best fit..not until a huge win then I'll be right on top.of it!

03/13/2021,stocks,">the fundamentals just don’t support the stock [price]

I completely agree with you, but one of the things I’ve learned is that the market generally doesn’t care about fundamentals as much as we like to think it does. There’s plenty of stock movement based on nothing more than a single tweet.

If you want repeatable, relatively safe gains then yes - fundamentals are what you should be looking at. But you’ll miss out on the big plays (GME, Tesla et al). That’s also totally okay. 

The bigger lesson I learned is that being happy with x amount of risk/losing $x as part of your risk strategy is extremely different when you’re staring at a multi-thousand dollar loss in your trading account versus when you’re mentally theorising about what your risk tolerance is."
03/13/2021,stocks,"I agree with one asterisk

The fundamentals are not limited to the company's stats. They include the overall market, which includes the huge shorting which in turn translates into possible big future demand.

The whole thing is of course silly and it's hard to separate the meme from reality. But with some calculated risk and a predefined entry/exit strategy, it can still be a decent opportunity. Provided of course that you do not just do silly things like yolo, diamond hands, ape chest thump, or averaging up. And of course, until the point of the big dump."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Couldn’t agree more. I truly blame the confirmation bias driven misinformation being circulated on WSB/DFV/GME. People who bought in on the hype train eat it up.

$10k share price is not feasible and echoing to rookie investors is dangerous. Feel bad knowing that people are going on margin or taking credit to hold that stock waiting for the *big squeeze* that’s simply not going to come.

Still feel like this round is a bull trap that hasn’t quite triggered yet. Some entity must have made a fortune yesterday from all the deep out of money options that expired."
03/13/2021,stocks,"You're talking about fundamentals when it comes to GME?

03/13/2021,stocks,Literally me.
03/13/2021,stocks,"But here’s the thing, you wouldn’t have just thrown it into a passive fund after. If you made $200k odds are you wouldn’t just be able to walk away. I tell myself the same thing all the time but I just don’t know if it’s true. Huge gains are addictive"
03/13/2021,stocks,"Yes, that's what I've learned as well. It's always right after the photo op that your stock tanks."
03/13/2021,stocks,"In a sense it worked out as by cashing out I had a lot of idle cash ready to take advantage of the oil dip, and I have more than doubled it. And now I have a fat tax loss carryover to offset a lot of those gains (which are now long term and I'm in the 0% bracket for those).

I definitely made out better than if I left the money alone in the original investments, but that was really circumstances and luck that allowed that. In my heart I am a passive investor and 2020 caused me a lot of financial stress and gray hairs that I didn't need.

Of course, having said that, what did I do this February? Bought GME, made $10k. :) I think having a small pile of funny money for offbeat opportunities is a good idea now."
03/13/2021,stocks,this logical post probably went over ppl heads 😂😂😂

03/13/2021,stocks,"Value investing is a philosophy as much as it is a strategy, so I'll answer this in both parts.

# Philosophy

Benjamin Graham, a professor of finance and economics at Columbia University, and Warren Buffett's mentor, is widely regarded as the father of value investing.  In 1934, he and David Dodd wrote the first edition of *Security Analysis*, which laid the foundations for modern securities analysis and valuation.  Following that, he published *The Intelligent Investor*, aimed more at the typical retail investor than an audience of finance professionals (as with the former).

In *The Intelligent Investor*, Graham lays out his definition of investing which I have since memorized:

>An investment operation is one which, upon thorough analysis, promises safety of principal and an adequate return.  Operations not meeting these requirements are speculative.

Deceptively simple, as Jason Zweig points out in his supplemental notes in the book, Graham's definition lays out four criteria for investing:

1. ""Investment operation"" - Investing should be treated like a business.
2. ""Thorough analysis"" - Investing should be conducted with due diligence in understanding the underlying business.
3. ""Safety of principal"" - For reasons I've printed elsewhere, loss of principal has a more adverse effect on investment performance over time because of its contribution to compounded returns.
4. ""Adequate return"" - Returns need not be extraordinary.  As Thomas Piketty writes in *Capital in the Twenty-First Century,* small, incremental growth rates snowball into large shifts over time due to the effects of compounding.

Consistent, achievable returns are therefore immensely more productive in the long run than inconsistent high returns coupled with high losses.  e.g. given a time horizon of fifty years, every dollar of lost principal is 160 future dollars lost.

# Methodology

As Warren Buffett later noted in his article, *""*[*The Superinvestors of Graham and Doddsville*](https://www8.gsb.columbia.edu/sites/valueinvesting/files/files/Buffett1984.pdf)*"" ,* published in the Fall 1984 issue of *Hermes,* the Columbia Business School magazine, if you keep purchasing securities well below their intrinsic, or fair, value, good things are bound to happen.

So like Buffett's contemporaries, including Walter Schloss, Stan Perlmeter and Bill Ruane, I focus solely on purchasing securities below fair value.  How I identify fair value is like how most M&A (mergers and acquisitions) analysts would value a business that their partners were considering acquiring.

Remember: Graham said to treat investing like a business.  And that's quite literally what I do.   I make capital allocation decisions based on a thorough review of the underlying business, provided they first meet some basic criteria.   I try to look for businesses with a price to book ratio below 3, though sometimes there are exceptions but we're still talking within single digits.  If a company is trading at 15 times its book value, I'm not going to spend one more second looking at it.

If I do go further, I want to see things like quick ratio, current ratio, return on assets (as a measure of their efficiency in using assets to generate operating cash), how wide a competitive moat they have and how committed their management team has been committed to or incentivized toward longer term objectives.

In finance, fair value is triangulated from various methods including Discounted Cash Flow Analysis, Net Current Assets Value, Dividend Discount Model, and compared against industry multiples of price to earnings, price to sales, EV/EBITDA, and so on.

I'm also looking at the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, mainly the operating cash flow, and how it ticks and ties to entries in the balance sheets and income statements. For example, if income and cash flow are reported positive but I'm seeing rising expense accruals I want to know whether that's because they're scheduled to pay certain bills twice a year, or because they are deferring expenses to conceal weakening quarterly performance.

I have a background in accounting/finance, so a lot of this comes very quickly for me... I honestly spend less than a couple hours a week analyzing securities.  But I make capital allocation decisions based not on any reports of market sentiment or who did what on Monday or Thursday, but simply whether I can acquire a piece of a company at a discount to their intrinsic value.  If their fair value is $60 per share, I want to buy them at $50... that way, if my estimate is off by a few dollars per share, I'm likely still well insulated from loss.

Then I'm going to hold that company for 3-5 years, or, if the book value of the company keeps growing at pace with the share price, I might hold them indefinitely as in the case of Berkshire Hathaway which has grown 2.8 million percent since 1964.

I don't listen to television.  I don't listen to street analysts whose job it is to persuade people to buy stocks.  I don't listen to people on the internet.  I'm not swayed by emotional arguments.  I don't care how much I might ""like"" the product.  I'm only interested in whether the business consistently and predictably generates operating cash and is of a business model that's relatively easy to understand so I have a level of confidence in my valuation.   The less confidence I have, the wider margin of safety I'm going to seek.  The more confidence I have, I might be more willing to accept less of a discount to fair value.  Also, as in the case of AT&T, if I know they've got a huge competitive moat but I'm unsure about their near term performance, I might purchase preferred shares for a lower, but guaranteed dividend.  This is essentially fixed income.

At the end of the day, the sole metric of a good business is how efficiently it acts as a money generating engine, and that sole metric is cash flow discounted to net present value."

03/13/2021,stocks,"It's actually the one drone company that became a big thing and has its own subreddit. I do believe drone tech is the future, but I happened to buy right before they did an offering and I haven't been green on it since. I'm ok holding that long term though. The others....eh.

I wish I'd gotten in on the psilocybin one, but honestly what got me in trouble was chasing ones that had already run anyway, so it's probably good i didn't get myself in deeper than I did.

Anyway, much happier now that I'm sticking to companies that have better fundamentals, more of a track record, and most importantly that I can set proper stop losses for. Probably not going to find one that will 5x my money in one go, but like you said, high risk and high reward. The risk was just winning out in my case lol."

03/13/2021,stocks,"Sorry, yes price. 

Problem with the idea of chasing TSLA’s and GME’s is there have been many companies that have had similar makings of “big plays”, but did not perform the same and resulted in people losing money. I’d say 9/10 you’re just gunna lose on these one-off risky plays. It’s the fallacy of chasing past performance. Now, Whenever I see Reddit posts with “short squeeze incoming for XYZ stock” I cringe cuz the end result is likely going to be a lot of retail bag holders. 

Can tweets move markets? Oh yes, but briefly as we’ve seen with musk and others.  For the most part, the price doesn’t stick. Great for day traders, bad for those who are seeking long term, wealth building holds. Hence why I feel fundamentals do matter."
03/13/2021,stocks,"I think that's the problem with GME that caused so many of us sleepless nights, that deep down inside we know it's not worth shit. If my index tracking ETF's were as volatile as GME, I think I could deal with it much better, because I actually believe in them."
03/13/2021,stocks,"I’ve “missed out” on the big plays for 20 years and beaten the market for the last 14. 

Because of compounding, not losing principal has a more profound effect on growth than chasing high returns which almost always is coupled with high losses.  If volatility is what you want, it’s what you’re going to get... in both directions.

Just because fundamentals don’t matter to speculators of the tech sector doesn’t mean institutional investors aren’t aware of them.  It’s like arguing everyone else jumped off the cliff, and they keep telling you to, so you should too."

That being said, due to this novel wave of retail being able to move markets with tweets and Reddit posts, fundamentals don’t quite matter for GME in the short term. But GME is not a long term play like Apple has been. Go ahead and mark this down so you can come back and laugh at me 10 years from now when GME is the next G in FAANG, but I don’t see it.

Yeah I've pretty much ran with that rule of thumb. I'm just letting my brain make its own connections. I may be right or wrong but at least I'm familiar with the source haha.

I'm not even letting my own DD get too technical. I don't need a full report. There's a lot of good analysis here and in other places, but in the end my decisions are only based on a few bullet points. The majority of what I do is look at the graphs and use support/resistance lines, triangles, etc., to see where I think things are going. Zooming out is a godly power.

For the most part it's all in an effort to stay calm and not get overwhelmed. I'm still new. If there's more important things for me to learn, I'll learn 😊"
03/13/2021,stocks,Yeah I got fucked on Roblox. FOMOed in because of CNBC. I don’t know why I did that. Was drunk at that time.
03/13/2021,stocks,"Yes, that is my direction as well. I would love that kind of crazy return that options allow.  Part of my issue is that I just do not know how to BUILD.  It is one thing timing the market and getting lucky, actually doing the fundamentals, actually making your goal whether its 60, 100, 1K/day however, how does one actually BUILD their wealth?  By increasing their investment?  Well, no sane person will do that so, is it DCA or options etc?  This is the knowledge I seek for the stock market.  Any thoughtS?  Anyone?"
03/13/2021,stocks,You can be pretty happy despite the loss of 800k. You played GME to perfection. That's insane!
03/13/2021,stocks,Nice! I basically FOMO bought one of your shares. Lesson learned
03/13/2021,stocks,Nice. I bought in at around 19 and sold at 105. Should have held a bit longer but realized nice returns.
03/13/2021,stocks,Mother fuck
03/13/2021,stocks,I read that the data volume doubles every year and bought DLR.
03/13/2021,stocks,What stock is it?
03/13/2021,stocks,Oh my. Sorry you had to go through that. What a nightmare.
03/13/2021,stocks,"One thing you can do is buy small. Don’t throw 20-30-50k into the market. Try 1k and just give it a couple months. Then you’re not in a whole lot and can still make gains. Do that every few months. 

Honestly, don’t worry about missing out. It’s been my problem too and I have to keep reminding myself about it. If you missed this dip, don’t sweat it snd catch the next one. There will always be a dip.

Also, have conviction with the investments. I watched a handful of stocks for nearly two years before buying in. I did my research and patiently waited. There’s nothing wrong with using that mental block to good effect. Patience is a virtue, after all.

Overall, people forget that the market has only ever gone up from inception. Look on any graph or chart from the past 100 years and you’ll see. Sure it has dips and dives and all out crashes, even bear markets, but it always recovers and shoots up another leg for even higher highs and higher lows.

On the grand scheme of things, you haven’t missed anything.

I deposited $1,300 at the end of January and I’m down $500. I’ve made back a little over $100 of that. I deposited another $125 (birthday money) and I’m back over $1k. I fully expect that even with my losses I’ll hit 2k by years end. The only defeat is quitting.

If you need to, talk to an actual investment advisor and get back on that horse. You got this."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Thank you, Great explanation!"
03/13/2021,stocks,Why wouldn’t these fill though? The price has to cross 210 on its way to 300. Seems like there’s something I’m missing.
03/13/2021,stocks,"I had an issue when the stock I had shot waaaaaay up, no, it wasn’t g. I tried to sell because I knew it was out of pattern for the stock. I cashed out with an $800 gain but lost out on 400 because of market freezes and the price blowing threw my sell. So I added other stocks to my portfolio and bought more of the initial stock after it crashed a few days later"
03/13/2021,stocks,Is the alternative stop limit? Something like stop loss
03/13/2021,stocks,Exactly what happened to me
03/13/2021,stocks,"I mostly buy at market for this reason. But again market price has got me to.. if its really crazy like above, I just  hold off till it stabilizes a little"
03/13/2021,stocks,I’m on fidelity. During a huge crash I tried to market sell and was denied because the bid/ask was to wide
03/13/2021,stocks,"Do you mean a stop loss?  Yeah I mean you could set a limit, the stock spikes, you buy at limit and then drops, but if you don't you'll be buying at the lowest bid.

Depending on the stock, the bid ask spread could be wide.  I bought a penny stock yesterday that was trading at $4.07, but I accidentally clicked Market instead of limit and bought it at $4.14.  I only bought 30 shares but instant loss of $2 or so."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Its very hard to do, but I heard a huge trader say that he lost his ass for a while starting out. The moment he was able to control his emotion and not panic buy/sell he started making huge cash. He currently makes millions per year. The problem for many of us is we just don't have tons of expendable income yet. Once you can truly only focus on numbers, you will shine."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Shoud have followed the data and not the news, done it many times too."
03/13/2021,stocks,You still made a profit though and that is good. Better than the other way around.
03/13/2021,stocks,You sold at a profit. That's a win. Trying to chase big moves will get you burned.
03/13/2021,stocks,"I mean you still pretty much 2x-ed your money so nothing wrong with that. Hindsight is 20/20, don't beat yourself up."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Maybe, but hard to anticipate it spiking up again. And was still a lot of money tied up."
03/13/2021,stocks,"I’ve come to learn in the short time I’ve started investing, that the mental stress of chasing tendies like GME is exhausting after a while. Especially if you work a full time job and what not. Gimme my low key ETFs and I’ll check em once a week maybe. Much happier and less stressed lol"
03/13/2021,stocks,"In the GME situation, people did not try to capitalize on the company's future or its fundamentals. They tried to capitalize on the stupidity of the people that over-shorted it. This has a life of its own, very separate from the fundamentals of the company. And a much shorter expiration date of course."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Of course. Tesla and GME provide very high risk opportunities where you can make a lot of money very quickly. There’s not many other ways you can 700%+ your money even within a year. 

They are extremely high-risk, extremely high-reward, but if you’re one of the lucky ones, you’ll get a return far greater than even 20 years of solid investing. Of course, you’ll still make money doing 20 years of solid investing, but it’s not quite the same.

IMO a big reason that retail investors go big in on the TSLA/GME plays is specifically because they don’t necessarily have the principal to create decent compounding for a long time. If you have $10million in the market, 8% yearly gains is $800k. I’d be more than happy with 800k per year increase. 

If you have $10k in the market, 8% yearly gains is $800. Sure, that will compound over time and in 10 years your $10k will have grown to a total value of $22k.

Meanwhile if you had put $10k into Tesla one year ago, it would now be worth over $60k. If you’d put $10k into GME *one month* ago it would now be worth over $50k"
03/13/2021,stocks,Lucky? Lucky doesn't move a stock over 1000% multiple times. This was a calculated DD that the hedges shorted the stock and we are right on the money. They haven't coverered and we are gonna squeeze them for so much more!

03/13/2021,stocks,"It was brutal.  The markets lost 75% of their value that year.   There has been nothing like that in 20 years.  Even 2008... not even remotely close.

I knew a coworker in his 50s who lost half his 401k retirement funds.

The mentality that's re-emerging today, but fueled by social media (FOMO is just a new word for peer pressure), has me deeply concerned that most Americans in the market will not survive the next crash.   I'm not worried about me, but these kids screwing around with day trading now weren't even born when the crash of 2000 happened.  They panicked the other week when tech stocks were down 10-15% for the year...  That's not me thinking ""hah, stupid Zoomers..."" it's me worried for their future."
03/13/2021,stocks,“less than two hours a week”.  So sometimes none.  This includes time spent screening for bargains.  I might find none.
03/13/2021,stocks,Just take all DD with a grain of salt and don’t stick to one source. WSB and similar subreddits are ripe with flat out false information. If data doesn’t fit the community sentiment blame it on HFs suppressing data or fake news.
03/13/2021,stocks,I'm new to investing and stocks. Been a pretty successful gambler though. When those cannabis stocks were trending I was a few days late and only lost a couple bucks in the end
03/13/2021,stocks,That happens. I wanted to get in but I didn't want to buy in for more than $50. Freed up $500 to get some. Going to look around for something else to buy into. Probably going to end up buying more AAPL

Sure, but in 30 years it grows to $100,626.  Most day traders or let's call them ""yolo""-traders won't make it to thirty years before going broke.

And it's like potato chips... they're not going to stop at one play.  I can't count the number of times I've heard that, and still you never see the same faces returning to any day trading message board. 

The alternative is to have a ""fuck around"" account but if it's going to move your total portfolio less than 1% then it's a lot of risk for very little reward either way... either because you expose yourself to loss of principal or you have to mitigate it so much that the gain is inconsequential to your larger portfolio.

Having a high-risk account grow my portfolio by $3k is a waste of my time."
03/13/2021,stocks,"I recognize that - but just because the makings for a squeeze is there, doesn’t mean it always comes to fruition. The squeeze is over, now it’s just buyer sentiment moving the stock. 

Furthermore, DD on potential short squeeze has nothing to do with fundamentals of a corporation. The massive short doesn’t make up for the fact GameStop is a company needing a full reinvention from the ground up if it wants to stay relevant and be profitable again in the next decade."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Stop saying we. We aren't doing anything. It's giants fighting each other and retail are just chilling waiting for an outcome. Not saying retail has no impact, but retail doesn't shoot a stock from mid 300s down to 160 and then shoot it straight up to 260 in very short periods of time. I'm sure people who fomoed at the top and sold during that drop without knowing why it was dropping contributed to a deeper drop(I mean, that's what that attack was for in the first place) but the outcome of this thing is going to be determined by firms, not retail."
03/13/2021,stocks,"I think you're telling yourself whatever makes you feel better because instead of diversifying after you lost you went back to the only thing you know, GME... but when you keep making decisions based on what everyone else was doing (which is what GME is), it works for a little while and then it doesn't.

No, not everyone is in the market on some kind of blind hope.  Some of us want to own pieces of stable businesses long term.  Gamblers don't beat the market 14 years in a row."

Keeping my shares though. I have very very hard....not feet."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Correct. I’m sure it’s happened to most of us at least once on a volatile day or AH. 

The moral of the story is limits are nice as a set it and forget it, but volume/volatility should factor into how you execute your order."
03/13/2021,stocks,Why would you have a limit order above market price though? To me the risk of limit prices seems that they are generally set at or below market price and so that price may never be met.
03/13/2021,stocks,I also had a limit order after hours and it wouldn’t execute because it was on day instead of extended. Luckily it only cost $5 per share
03/13/2021,stocks,Most traders don’t beat the market anyway.

I don’t pretend to know what’s going to happen in five to ten years with technology.  Anyone who says they know for certain is lying.  So you’ve got to have tremendous tolerance for risk if you go there because it’s a gamble. I don’t gamble."
03/13/2021,stocks,"When you're buying, you need to look at the ask price, not the last trade price"
03/13/2021,stocks,If the price is moving upwards or moving around a lot you could place the limit slightly above the current ask to ensure it executes
03/13/2021,stocks,Sounds like you answered your own question?
03/13/2021,stocks,"Fair enough, but you still have to keep an eye for inflated prices and time your positioning."
03/13/2021,stocks,"I don't need convincing.  There's an entire track record of value investors throughout the history of the market, and having done this for 25 years and having watched dozens and dozens and dozens of gamblers come and go on message boards like this... the gamblers never come back after those first two years?  Why? Because every single one of you gets wiped out by the market.

Come back in two, four, six, eight, ten years and see if I'm wrong."
03/13/2021,stocks,Learned this the hard way
03/13/2021,stocks,"But as mentioned in the previous comment that I replied to, with a super volatile stock it can go past your limit price without executing."
03/13/2021,stocks,"No? For example a stock is $10 so you set a limit buy at $10 or less, why would you set a limit buy above the $10 market price? Paying market price would be better?"
03/13/2021,stocks,"Sure. I agree, but if the company is valuable the stock will reflect it.  Just patience."
03/13/2021,stocks,You obviously didn’t ready the other responses. Been investing for 4 almost 5 years
03/13/2021,stocks,"Referring to market open.

If it is at exactly $10 at market close the night before, so you set a $10 buy limit. It may be $10.001 when your order is set to fill and it gets passed up. If you put one at $10.10 or even $10.05, your order is getting filled.

If your order fills and it pops up to $15 by lunch and you just bought 1000 shares, that petty 00.05 you paid extra ($50) is laughable to the ~$5K you made setting it a bit higher."
03/13/2021,stocks,Maybe he’s talking about for right when market opens?
03/13/2021,stocks,"So you can get all the stock your money can buy all the way up to your limit. It doesn't matter unless you have a lot of money to spend or you just REALLY want the stock, but also don't want to pay wherever the market happens to be at when your oder executes (maybe you'll pay 20% more but not 50% more)."
03/13/2021,stocks,So about half the time between the 2000 and 2008 crash.  Let's catch up again in two decades.
03/13/2021,stocks,Yes but that’s why a market bid would likely be better in that case wouldn’t it? Since with that limit bid you have the risk of paying above market price and also have the risk of the price quickly bypassing your order and not getting filled. If you put one at $10.05 the price might “fly right by your limit order and won’t trigger” as mentioned above.
03/13/2021,stocks,You have this annoying “i know it all” attitude. I think you’re trying real hard to convince yourself otherwise dude. Stop
03/13/2021,stocks,"I don't need convincing of anything.  Five years doesn't tell me anything other than you are literally going down the same path I did.

And I understand... nobody could have told me at the time.  I had to lose my ass to find out.  I was hoping to prevent you from losing yours.  But I can't make you want that.

So... good luck."
2021-03-13 00:03:36,stocks,"Resources to quickly build a custom ETF and preview performance? Are there any sites or tools that easily let me build a list of tickers for an ETF and show recent performance of those tickers as well as how the ETF itself would have performed over the same time?  

Let's say I want to build an ARKK of my own in some sector like, I don't know, pet food?  So it would have PetSmart and PetCo tickers, Chewy, and other stuff, and weights for each.  It would be great to be able to see a chart with performance of all individual tickers along with performance of the ETF when weights are taken into account.

2021-03-12 23:52:11,stocks,"Leveraged ETF Risks I currently am interested in investing in the technology/semiconductor industry. I bought into some SOXL which is semiconductors bull 3x leverage shortly selling afterwards with a nice profit. This is basically a two part question, is investing in leveraged ETFs for a week or maybe two a poor decision? I'm having a difficult time understand how risky leveraged ETFs are, is there a good chance I could lose the entire investment? If leveraged ETFs very risky what would be better option, just buy a specific stock, or a unleveraged ETF?"
03/13/2021,stocks,"I hold TQQQ indefinitely, long term.

You'll find that over the long term, volatility decay, as well as gain/loss amplification are pretty negligible. During a bull market, TQQQ easily beats any of the tech giants, and usually beats it's underlying (assuming bullish leverage)

I don't know about SOXL, but I read the prospectus for TQQQ and the risks to the fund seem very unlikely. They obtain leverage by buying swaps from banks. The biggest risk might be a liquidity problem like in 08 where the banks couldn't deliver on their swaps. Otherwise, the biggest risk to the integrity of the fund was something like taxes increases the expense ratio of the etf.. no big deal. With JPow printing, I'm not worried about the banks failing on their side of the swaps.

For now, I think TQQQ is a safe and good long term hold.

Be sure to read the prospectus for SOXL."
03/13/2021,stocks,"I only hold 3X ETFs including FNGU.  And I hold them long term.  I too find the decay and lack of tracking to be minimal.  Decay accounts for less than 3% per  year. on the annualized numbers.  Since inception, TQQQ has returned 3X, or there abouts, minus 2.7% compared to the QQQ.  

Yes, it is volatile.  When the markets correct, it gets slobberknockered.  But I hold on and it always has bounced back.   By holding it  long term, I'm not worried about the sell offs.  I actually have experienced lots of them and I think it is much riskier trying to time it.  Just buy it, hold on, relax, and let it show you how it way out performs mutual funds and most hedge funds.

I have yet to see any kind of real life evaluation of it.  They are always hypotheticals.  IF it did this and IF it did that, it would go to zero.  I call BS.  If the proverbial bullfrog had wings......

Another way I think its better is, unlike margin for leverage, leveraged ETFs have NO MARGIN CALLS.  You can't be sold out when it goes down.  In 40 years of investing, I never use margin.  Ever."
03/13/2021,stocks,"I just dropped some cash into YINN(leveraged China bull)...see what happens on Monday.

I watch the price movements and it see that it moves up and down every other day like clockwork.  If it is up on Monday, I will sell and buy back on the Tuesday morning dip.   
Since the inverse china ETF (YANG) is also an option, maybe I play both alternating.

Same company has emerging market leveraged funds EDC and EDZ."
03/13/2021,stocks,"I only invest in leveraged ETFs for the long haul.  Decay runs about 2.5% per year.  Tracking error is immaterial to me and its minimal as well.  Unlike margin there are NEVER ANY MARGIN CALLS.  I can hold it until it goes back up and reap my 3X reward.

If you look at SSO (@X S&P 500), UPRO (3X S&P 500, TQQQ (3 X QQQ) and FNGU (3X top five QQQ stocks and five others) since inception, they all blow the doors off mutual funds and  hedge funds.

SSO has been around the longest and survived 2008.  It has returned over double the S&P 500.  

TQQQ has rediculously high returns since inception."
03/13/2021,stocks,"At least with an ETF you know if it's leveraged.  You don't necessarily know if it's a REIT.  I bought and am holding NLY, but I wouldn't have if I knew upfront how overleveraged it is."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Come to think about it...  3x ETFs (unless it's a total bear market) are much safer than option leaps/margin trading for larger sum of money

If you held options in 2019 to March 2020, you'd likely lost everything & on margins you get called

3x ETFs? 70% loss but recovers damn near quickly especially Tech/Semi ones... even surpassing the underlying again

* You probably have to wait 3-6 months, e.g. TQQQ and boom your past gains comes back n more

It's risky... but if you held TQQQ 5-7 years & even sold at March 2020, it'll outperform even QQQ"
03/13/2021,stocks,"SOXL is pretty similar in terms of movement. Almost, as you said, like clockwork. My tactic is to buy more when it’s down for 2 days in a row. It almost always kicks  back up after that. I had considered selling and playing the inverse SOXS when it’s up for a few days but I’m a firm believer that trying to time the market is a fools game. Plus, usually on the days when I’m considering doing that, are the days when SOXL has one of its signature face ripping rallies, and Boy am I glad I decided against it on those days lol. I just suck it up on those red days, and hold on. Leveraged ETFs require an iron will for sure, but I agree that the benefits of holding them long term outweigh the downsides. Just gotta know when to get out for a while if need be"
03/13/2021,stocks,"I’d have to reread the prospectus, but The fund is structured in such a way that you won’t lose more than 90% in a given day. Almost like a cap on loss. So say SOX was down 35%, you would still only lose 300% of -30% instead of 300% of 35%. 
That would still be a very vulgar and depressing day, but you shouldn’t lose 100% of your investment...at least not in a single day. I keep a position in SOXL, obviously, but not in a set it and forget it kind of way."
03/13/2021,stocks,"If SOXL goes down 33 1/3%, you lose 33 1/3%.  Maybe you meant to say if the 1X goes down 33 1/3%."

However, that actually would not  occcur unless SOX was down 33/13% in one day.

It would be down big time if it did that over  say a week or  even two days, but it  wouldn't go to zero.  I has to do that in one day as they rebalance each day."

2021-03-12 23:45:00,stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, March 12, 2021. Please enjoy! **PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, March 12, 2021**

Stocks traded mixed on Friday, with technology stocks coming under pressure once again as Treasury yields resumed their march forward. The Dow extended gains from yesterday, hitting fresh intraday records. The S&P 500 (SPY) opened in the red but managed to climb throughout the session to finish modestly green.

After months of negotiation, President Biden signed into law a new $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package after the bill passed in both houses of Congress by party-line votes. The bill includes provisions like $1,400 stimulus checks to most Americans, $300 per week in augmented unemployment benefits through early September, and $350 billion in state, local and tribal government aid. The bill comes exactly one year following the World Health Organization's formal designation of the coronavirus outbreak as a pandemic on March 11, 2020. 

The 10-year Treasury yield climbed more than 10 basis points to reach a fresh, one year high at 1.628%. This marks a rise of around 50 basis points compared to levels from a month ago. Yields are rising in response to inflationary fears and expectations for explosive growth as the economy reopens.  Kit Juckes, Societe Generale macro strategist, wrote in a note to clients, “The pattern seems clear enough: The equity market is seeing a sector rotation but not a correction; the bond market is seeking a new equilibrium in the light of a vastly improved economic outlook in both the U.S. and elsewhere.”

Rising Treasury yields hurt high-growth stocks the most because high-growth companies generate most of their cash and earnings years down the road. Future cash decreases in today's dollars as rates increase partly because investors have more opportunity to earn bigger returns from assets paying higher interest and dividends right now. 

In vaccine news, shares of Novavax (NVAX) jumped 8% on Friday after a final[ analysis of the drugmaker's COVID-19 vaccine trial in the UK showed the inoculation was 96.4% effective ](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-confirms-high-levels-efficacy-against-original-and-0)against the original strain of the coronavirus. Analyses also showed the vaccine was 86.3% effective against the variant of the coronavirus circulating in the UK, and 55.4% effective against the variant circulating in South Africa.

After AstraZeneca (AZN) and European officials asked the US to share their stockpile of AZN while the FDA conducts further trials to determine whether to grant the vaccine emergency use authorization. In other news, several countries have suspended distribution of AZN’s vaccine following reports of blood clots. A WHO spokeswoman, Margaret Harris, said at a briefing that an advisory committee was investigating reports of individuals falling ill or dying after developing blood clots in the post-vaccination period, but that no causal link had been established.

To preface, I work in the technology industry amongst the giants (FAANG) and have met with plenty of operations engineers at various tech conferences that work at Roblox to better understand what they're doing, how they're doing it, and what their scope of work entails. It may come as a surprise, but Roblox isn't really a video game; Roblox isn't a game developer, nor are they a major publishing house that owns creative groups and studios like EA or Activision. Roblox is an open and free operations platform for small, independent game developers with a universal and aggressive microtransaction economy. Roblox the company does not really make games. They run them for other people and provide the tools and education needed to create that content.

There's a lot of stuff for me to explain here for people who aren't first degree constituents of the video game, entertainment, and technology market, so let's dive in:

What are the following?:

\- Game Engine

\- Microtransactions

\- DLC

\- Game Servers

\- DRM Platforms

Game Engines, much like Unity, Unreal Engine, Amazon Lumberyard, and CryEngine are software development toolkits. These are comprehensive all-in-one toolkits for putting together the assets that make a video game. These Engines typically cover things like 3D model animations, scripted events, programming logic, rendering and lighting, dynamic effects, and in some cases lightweight networking to support things like multiplayer capabilities. There is an entire market for Game Engines alone. Some of the most comprehensive ones such as Unreal Engine were used to build a staggeringly large amount of games which can be listed here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_Unreal\_Engine\_games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Unreal_Engine_games) (this list is also very much incomplete, which goes to show the vast amount of titles made in UE over the years). Game Engines exist to make a game developer's life easier, so they don't have to start from scratch having to write really rudimentary boilerplate code to get their idea materialized. If you're still struggling to understand this concept-- it's like a box of legos. Some lego collections are offered by different companies for their rich feature sets, accessibility, saturation of domain knowledge, and popularity.

DLC, or Downloadable Content, has been a core function of the video game industry since the days of Atari. Various games over the years have offered post-purchase content and updates to video games either as free options (which were used to build brand loyalty and trust with game consumers) or to monetize in layers, allowing a video game to rake in revenue beyond the initial box sticker price. Many video games have even been structured as a service-type offering, where the base game is quite small while the content itself is piecemealed as a vast library of DLC; Look at games like Rock Band, where acquiring all of the hardware and software/songs offered in the one game could cost a consumer north of $5,000. Yes, a video game that costs $5,000 in its entirety. [https://www.eteknix.com/rock-band-4s-dlc-costs-total-3926/](https://www.eteknix.com/rock-band-4s-dlc-costs-total-3926/)

In 2006, Bethesda took the concept of the DLC a step further and experimented with pricing individual in-game resources such as horse armor for a few bucks. They wanted to see if consumers would pay the usual $40-60 box sticker price of their game, plus an *optional* $2.50 for just one set of horse armor in The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. The gaming community was largely outspoken against these types of DLC, yet it remained one of the most purchased DLCs of the game, even two years beyond its original release date. There is an entire history on microtransactions and their titanic influence and significance on the video game industry, which I encourage anyone and everyone to read about. As an anecdote to frame this conversation: Supercell, a Helsinki mobile game developer that brought a game called ***Clash of Clans*** on mobile devices worldwide to 46 countries received only a few rounds of external investments at $12M and $130M before proceeding to rake in a staggering average of $1B per year in revenue from 2014 to 2016, which made the small game studio turn into a market giant in its area seemingly overnight. How? Clash of Clans pioneered a growing and popular strategy of charging for in-game-currencies called Gems which tap into root behaviors of human psychology that trigger in textbook gambling addiction. [https://www.tuw.edu/psychology/psychology-behind-microtransactions/](https://www.tuw.edu/psychology/psychology-behind-microtransactions/). By allowing players to accelerate progression in their game by using ""Gems"" which were purchased directly in their game, players (and commonly children) were able to swipe their credit cards frequently in order to get quick dopamine hits. With very basic game mechanics and a compelling system for purchasing this fake currency to progress in the game, they created an extremely low-cost revenue-generating behemoth.

The success of Clash of Clans alone deserves its own article to better educate what's happening to the video game industry as a whole right now, but I won't cover that. Mobile app markets like the Google Play Store and the iPhone Apps store are currently saturated with low-quality video games whose sole designs are to replicate the success of Supercell and their revenue-generating monster. You personally may have noticed an aggressive advertisement era as of late revolving around games like Arknights, AFK Arena, Raid Shadow Legends, or similarly titled/marketed video \*free\* video games on Youtube. All of them are designed to hook into your carnal desires and feed the gambling addict at everyone's core. They have increased spending on advertisement and marketing by 2x during COVID-19 because screen engagement and video game consumption has increased by the exact same rate during the pandemic-- and it pays off. [https://www.warc.com/newsandopinion/news/video-game-brands-spend-double-on-ads-during-covid-19-crisis/43652](https://www.warc.com/newsandopinion/news/video-game-brands-spend-double-on-ads-during-covid-19-crisis/43652) These aren't video games anymore. These are your modern-day casinos.

Now let's cover the primary cost center of this industry: operations.

The primary cost of any video game developer and publisher aside from game development itself is the knowledge, time, and materials it takes to develop, run, and deploy online video game infrastructure to serve consumers. This is similar to the material and production/manufacturing cost of any standard physical or tangible product or good. The servers, maintainers, elastic scaling capability, network throughput, geographical locations, application distribution all boils down to the bottom line of what it costs to launch a game in order for it to bring home revenue. Even in 2020, we saw major AAA game studios struggle in this regard. MMORPG games such as World of Warcraft, Everquest, and even lesser-known household names like Anarchy Online typically can often live or die depending on the success of their launch and how well they maintain their consumer base. It costs a lot to hire and sustain engineers that know how to build out server infrastructure, make an application widely accessible, highly available, with continuous availability. In many cases, this operational cost eats the revenue and can force publishers and game developers to scale down their applications or reduce their capacity of consumption. This also has impacts on the quality of services and geographical accessibility.

DRM Platforms, also referred to as Digital Rights Management Platforms, are platforms such as Valve's Steam, Epic Games' Epic Game Store, and EA's Origin assist with distributing video games to consumers, allowing them to build digital libraries of their purchases. This helps prevent piracy, but also provides a convenience aspect to acquiring copies of video game titles without having to resort to purchasing physical game copies in brick and mortar retailers. Microsoft also has a store like these built into Windows 10 that spans across the Xbox Live ecosystem, allowing people to pay for things like the ""Game Pass"" which is a blanket subscription to play temporary copies of video games that are not owned outright by consumers. This allows them to ration costs and revenue across multiple creative subordinates through the Game Studios program, which they are growing from purchasing game studios like Bethesda and Mojang in order to bolster the value of their subscription-based offering.

Before talking about what Roblox is in context, et's take a quick look at one of the most industry-changing games in the last 20 years: Blizzard's Warcraft 3.

In the era of the early 2000's, between 2002-2004, Blizzard released a game called Warcraft 3, as well as an expansion called Warcraft 3 The Frozen Throne. Along with this video game, they also released the World Editor, which was a map-creation tool for players to create their own content referred to as ***Custom Games***. The World Editor was essentially a small and limited game engine, allowing people to import custom models, model maps, and created scripted events much like a full-fat engine like Unreal Engine or Unity. People were creating tons of minigames, including a Mario Party ripoff called Uther Party, tag games like Tree Tag and Sheep Tag, party murder games like Murder in the Mansion, small ARPGs where you could load and save your character progression much like Diablo, as well as one of the biggest industry disrupters: DotA.

DotA, also called Defense of the Ancients, was a custom map created for Warcraft 3 and The Frozen Throne by a small group of players which gave birth to an entire genre of video games called MOBA or Multiplayer Online Battle Arena which spawned entire companies like Riot Games and their League of Legends market leader, which over time also evolved into the Battle Royale format we see in popular children's games like Fortnite. By leveraging the peer-to-peer networking offered by the Battle.net ecosystem of Warcraft 3, small individuals like you or me were able to materialize a game concept with little to no developer incurred operations cost, to then create a 40+ billion dollar industry outside of the game itself.

So how does Roblox play into all of this?

Roblox, much like Warcraft 3 from the early 2000's, serves as a development and operations platform for small game developers to materialize concepts, scale their operations, and monetize from their creations with almost no barrier to entry. The Roblox application itself isn't actually a game, but a browser for their massive marketplace of consumer-created content, almost like a YouTube of video games. You don't have to buy or download games, so it's not the same as a DRM platform like Steam, and they take care of running the servers for your games without exposing the creators to the cost and details of doing so. Instead of only relying on peer-to-peer networking which doesn't scale like Warcraft 3 (which had problems with more than 24 players), they have a completely transparent centralized server infrastructure providing operations for individual developers much like a service with zero upfront cost.

They focus a lot on enabling content creators and developers. They offer their own library of education and enablement at [https://www.roblox.com/create](https://www.roblox.com/create) to show people how to use and develop with their Game Engine. They don't charge licensing fees, and the engine itself is far simpler to use and more intuitive than others like Unreal Engine and Unity. You can see a wide gamut of content creators, from juveniles to adolescents, to professional adult game developers. If you are more curious about what Roblox the company actually creates, visit [Their technology portfolio here](https://corp.roblox.com/technology/#:~:text=The%20Roblox%20Reality%20Engine%20is,the%20capabilities%20of%20each%20device)

How do they make money? Microtransactions. Just like how Supercell created a revenue-generating monster with their single hit Clash of Clans and their Gem currency abstraction, the entire Roblox platform uses a currency called Robux. Robux is purchased for a lot of different uses-- player cosmetics, game purchases, priority serving on specific games, progression advancement, you name it. It's a single unified digital currency that applies to all content on the platform, and the individual developers of games historically have received a 30% cut of the purchases made in their games.

Roblox doesn't have to make any content-- they strictly focus on the technology enabling the entire Roblox game ecosystem. They aren't like any other game studio, because they aren't. You can think of them like a video game operations company that builds universal tools and the platform for people to create, share, and consume game content. Think of them as an all-in-one service provider for game devs. They distribute your game, run it, and give you the lego blocks to make it. They are the Unreal Engine + Steam + EA/Activision altogether. It has the potential to revolutionize how we consume video games, how we fund game developers, and how we advance Game Engine technology and capabilities. There is already a clone of every AAA game on their ecosystem-- Call of Duty? Bad Business. Counter Strike? Counter Blox. Murder in the Mansion? Murder Party. All of the cosmetic offerings you see generating revenue in free-to-play games like League of Legends exists across all of these mini-games as well, generating revenue for the game developers and Roblox themselves. You'll see lots of comments online with people saying ""My kid plays the crap out of roblox all the time and spends a bunch of my money on it"" because the platform encourages young kids to spend money on countless superficial content like avatars, skins, and progression through Robux. Imagine how impulsive adult consumers of League of Legends are and how much that has enabled Riot Games to grow with a single game offering. Now imagine the heightened impulsivity of a child on that same consumption platform with your credit card across the endless game offerings. It's a money-printing machine.

There's also huge runway for vertical growth for their company-- Game Engine capabilities, Roblox Client improvements, platform availability, external advertisement, and monetization models. The fact that people online are speculating on their value without understanding what the company does goes to show the hidden value in what they can provide to the industry, and what potential they have that is untapped.

People slept on Tesla, Netflix, Amazon during their initial phases as ""just a SF tech company,"" ""Just a mail-in blockbuster,"" and ""Just a book reseller"" without understanding the potential breadth of their disruption to what we now know today. To reiterate, I work in this industry and have had opportunities to talk with a lot of the engineers that run these systems at Roblox, and they are extremely knowledgeable and have a passion for doing things right. They use a lot of the same free and open source technology that we use to run cloud infra like AWS, Azure, GCP, and IBM Cloud.

I am not a financial advisor, and this is not financial advice. I disclose that I am long on this stock. I would encourage people to read more on their own, and do not miss this opportunity. Buy, Hold, and forget this exists in your portfolio.

Reddit might blow it up, or it might pump and dump with media hype, but I strongly encourage people try not to time the market and just get in. I hope this post has been informative for you all, especially for those who don't have enough exposure to this industry to know what's going on."
2021-03-12 23:04:31,stocks,"Is Apple really a forever stock? I see so many people saying apple is a forever stock. 

Quantitatively I think it’s over valued currently. I know people won’t stfu about services. If people stop using iPhone and others their services profits will go away too.

I know we have the 5G cycle coming up, but long term I think the smart phone will go the way of the laptop which is cheap and low profit margin. People could become privacy conscious and get a Linux phone when it eventually comes out (I am seriously considering getting a Linux phone). The iPhones market share is constantly shrinking. Revenue has been flat for years. 

I know they gave Apple Pay, but that’s with credit card and visa benefits from that. 

Apple hasn’t been innovative since Steve Jobs died. 

Would like to know everyone’s thoughts. If I’m wrong about something please correct me"
03/13/2021,stocks,"I do think Apple is in big trouble because their main revenue stream, the iPhone, has been caught up to by Samsung and there are way more good phones for a much more reasonable price. Not everyone can afford a $1,100 phone, which is why Apple phone sales have started to die off. Apple was sort of like Tesla for the first 3-5 years the iPhone was out, nobody had anything even close to it on the market. By the time everyone else caught up Apple was ""the"" phone brand to buy, and they got millions of people hooked on their ecosystem using the iPhone during that period. I think Apple was smart to start Apple TV; they have to do SOMETHING to expand their business elsewhere. The big problem Apple has though is that technology has gotten much cheaper in the past decade. You can buy a high end laptop for a fraction of what an Apple laptop costs and you get close to the same performance. Apple has always been able to charge a super high premium for their products, but that's going to be more and more difficult going forward. All this to say, yes Apple will be around for a long long time because they have a cult like following with their customers, but they better come up with some new innovation soon (maybe their own smart car) or they are not going to be the mammoth they have been in another 5-10 years."
03/13/2021,stocks,No one is buying Linux phones.  Lolz
03/13/2021,stocks,"U’re dead wrong and need to do more research 

Haven’t been innovative for years? They just released their M1 chip which is made in-house.

Revenue flat for years? They just reported record revenue for q4 2020...

Haven’t even mentioned the fact that they’re sitting on the biggest stock pile of cash in the world..

Ur assessment is so off that it seems like ure straight up talking out of ur ass lol

They r definitely a forever hold. U’re not looking for insane growth when u want to hold a stock forever. Just one that gradually grows safely for the next 30-50 years. apple isn’t going anywhere for a long time"
03/13/2021,stocks,"Yeah cause Linux dominates laptops and desktops. Apple fans won’t be giving up their iPhones. 

I don’t see prices of new smart phones coming down because people are used to paying a monthly charge and trading in every one to two years. As long as there’s a market for those used phones then I don’t see smart phone prices coming down.

That said I can’t disagree that AAPL is still above the average PE for SP500."
03/13/2021,stocks,"I believe it's because they're thinking 5-10 years ahead. 

The M1 chip as engineered currently is either on par, or edging out Intel performance, and it's 1st generation. Apple could also license this chip to other companies, or branch out and create more ""smart"" devices that are more deeply integrated than any other ecosystem since they'd be built on the same software and hardware by the same company.

Apple's M1 chips will be rolled out to all of their devices in the future unifying and solidifying (more) their OS and Mobile platforms providing an even more seamless experience across all the screens a user stares at.

They're devices and services ecosystem is an incredible convenience and puts ""cool"" tech into the hands of a lot of people with money who could care less about all the reasons people don't like Apple. To this effect, Apple creates lifetime brand users who have no interest in moving to a different platform.  

Apple's changing their privacy policies, and clamping down more and more, forcing the advertising industry to adjust its patterns to avoid crazy legal problems involving targeting and digital fingerprinting. Google's moving to trading ""groups"" over individual targeting and this means everyone else will need to as well.

Epic is suing them over App Store royalties, if they win, this will cost Apple some cash, probably a few billion at least but will cause an influx of new and old App Developers to the platforms looking to capitalize on Apple having to take a reduced cut.

I expect them to move off the reliance of AWS and other cloud providers. Depending on how big they go, it could be a competitor, or they could just run Apple's services.

I believe Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft are all just following same long-term game-plan, just in slightly different ways."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Apple laptops are not low margin. That’s why 90%~ laptop profits belong to AAPL.

03/13/2021,stocks,"I think it's a lifetime stock. It might not be the best choice to keep it a lifetime, but I think you'll do well.

I don't think you should bet on Linux phones getting popular. People generally don't care about privacy and many iPhone users don't even want to try out Android phones."
03/13/2021,stocks,No stock is a forever stock. They are at least a next 10-20 year stock.
03/13/2021,stocks,"Do they though?

A company dying is more comparable to an organism going extinct, rather than a single body dying.

Some organisms do go extinct.

Others, however, adapt.

As long as nobody royally fucks something up, a company like, say, Disney will exist as long as there are human beings on this Earth. It may not look the same in 300/500/1,000+ years, but as long as there are still people, there will still be a Disney.

Is it the same for Apple? Most likely, in some capacity. It may eventually go private or get bought out & become a subsidiary of someone else, but I doubt the human race will ever again see a world without Apple."

2021-03-12 23:00:35,stocks,"ETSY Long term investment SHOP - worth 140b

Google , Bing, all other search engine are monopolized by Amazon, Walmart, big corporations. No amount of SEO will help you rank beyond the 5th page of google for major keyboards. That is simply because small businesses cannot outspend these big corporations, and not just spending, they got connections.

Etsy, on the other hand, is on par with Amazon and sometimes even rank 1. Pinterest also backlinks hugely to Etsy, both of high rankers. Etsy have direct buying experience. Their ad cost is SUPER low, lower than Facebook and google! How do they afford this? Because their business model is taking a cut on sales, and the cut is way lower than Amazon and other platforms. And the ad is just pure profit for them since seo ranking, pins, and on site. They only charge on purchase. 


Etsy is worth well over 50b! Shop is worth 140b, and SHOP is so bad for small businesses. It’s great for drop shippers, who just ship from ali express that takes 2-4 months to arrive at a 1000% mark up price. Furthermore, shop overhead cost doesn’t even help you with seo! You have to advertise yourself, and ad prices are outrageous now and targeted advertisement is dying with google and apple getting rid of it. These Shopify stores usually stay on page 500 on google never seeing the light of day. And as more people catch on to ali-express and their reverse image search, I’m assuming these drop shipping sites will probably wane, since ali-express is 100 times cheaper with same delivery time of months. 


Etsy is the only way to build brand recognition. They do not allow drop shipping for items that is obviously resell. This will increase customer trust as Amazon is just ali-express with fast delivery and shop stores are mostly just Wish clones marketing one product. As more and more people realize they are getting ripped off and not getting products in respect to its true value, more ppl will go on Etsy, where small business and crafters can scale and sell while having a relationship with customers. 


Etsy is undervalue! Even their ad model alone is worth a lot !"
03/13/2021,stocks,"One thing about Etsy that I cannot stand is they have no customer service, zero! If you want to cancel an order, the seller has to do it for you. That doesn’t sound so bad until you realize how many scammers there are on Etsy. Well, now the scammer deletes their Etsy account a day after they receive enough purchases. The website literally asks you to message the scamming seller (whose account no longer exists) to cancel your order. Try sending a message? It won’t go through, obviously. You are stuck fighting your credit card company to get the money back."

03/13/2021,stocks,"I've been selling on Etsy since 2013 and Shopify since 2018.  I like both companies and you make some good points about them, but I can tell by your post that you aren't actually a seller or a buyer on Etsy.

You said ""Etsy does not allow drop shipping for items that is obviously resell""  this is absolutely not true anymore, just go to the Etsy and EtsySellers subreddits, you will see how many reports there are of Etsy sellers getting away with dropshipping from AliExpress and even reselling items bought from Amazon.

Etsy sellers are being taken advantage of more and more since Etsy went public, and huge numbers of sellers are moving towards Shopify because they can actually make more on that platform due to much lower fees and more control.

Every business decision that Etsy has made since their IPO has hurt their sellers.

Etsy stock may still continue to perform well because they have done a great job of advertising and giving the appearance that they are supporting small independent businesses and crafters, but this is simply not the case anymore.

Just my two cents."

Etsy takes care of SEO as long as those items are in demand and unique.

2021-03-12 22:33:58,stocks,"Canadian Tire and NuPort Robotics to Commercialize Canada’s First Automated Heavy Duty Trucking Technology Canadian National retailer Canadian Tire Corporation and Toronto based start-up NuPort Robotics Inc., Canada's first autonomous trucking company, have announced a partnership with the Ontario government to invest $3 million to undertake an automated heavy duty trucking project to test a first-of-its-kind-in-the-world technology.

The breakthrough technology provides a transportation solution for the middle mile, the short-haul shuttle runs that semi-tractor trailers make between distribution centres, warehouses and terminals each day. It is designed to enable next-generation automated trucks that are more fuel efficient, safer to operate, and provide an enhanced driver experience.

Backed by $1 million in support from the Ontario government through Ontario's Autonomous Vehicle Innovation Network (AVIN) and matched by $1 million investments from Canadian Tire and NuPort Robotics, respectively, the two-year project is applying proprietary, artificial intelligence (AI) technology from NuPort Robotics to retrofit two conventional semi-tractor trailers - which will always be attended by a driver - with high-tech sensors and controls, a touchscreen navigation system, and other advanced features such as obstacle and collision avoidance.

""Ontario is proud to be a global leader in automated and connected vehicle technology and this innovative project is an exciting milestone toward automated vehicle tech in the trucking industry,"" said Caroline Mulroney, Minister of Transportation. ""Ontarians rely on goods being delivered by trucks across the province every day and projects like this are demonstrating the ways that automated truck technology could help businesses meet delivery demands more efficiently while supporting a strong supply chain in Ontario.""

""This project applies unique and made-in-Ontario Artificial Intelligence technology that offers increased safety and efficiency, with a reduced carbon footprint, to the goods supply chains on which we all rely,"" said Vic Fedeli, Ontario Minister of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade. ""This is the latest example of how Ontario's Autonomous Vehicle Innovation Network acts as a catalyst, fostering partnerships between ambitious technology start-ups and industry to develop and commercialize next generation transportation technologies that strengthen our economy and benefit society.""

""The trucks are currently transporting goods between a Canadian Tire distribution centre in the Greater Toronto Area and nearby rail terminals within a 12.5 mile radius, and early results are promising"" said Raghavender Sahdev, CEO of NuPort Robotics. ""The aim of the project is to develop a system that incorporates an autopilot feature for conventional trucks with a driver, leading to the most efficient way to drive and increase safety. The sensors work as a ‘safety cocoon' to cover blind spots and prevent accidents and the end result is peak fuel efficiency, meaning lower carbon emissions, and peak driving performance for an overall more optimal transportation experience.""

NuPort Robotic's approach to autonomous trucking is unique in the industry because it focuses only on solving the middle mile challenge, using a known set of predetermined trucking routes that are repetitive and high frequency as opposed to general highway driving. Ultimately, when implemented on fixed routes in the future, Canadian Tire will benefit from faster commercial deployments and improvements in supply chain sustainability.

""Canadian Tire embraces innovation and is always testing new technologies to improve our operational efficiency and safety. As proud Canadian companies, the safety of all stakeholders, including drivers, employees, customers, and public will be the top priority as we work together towards deployment of this technology,"" said Gary Fast, Vice-President of Transportation, Canadian Tire.

""Over the last three years, Canadian Tire has made a significant effort to solve complex business problems by using the Canadian start-up Artificial Intelligence ecosystem, and NuPort Robotics exemplifies what we look for in a start-up with a focus on innovation, automation and artificial intelligence,"" added Cari Covent, Vice President of Intelligent Automation, Canadian Tire.

""As NuPort Robotics continues to develop new technologies to overcome middle mile supply chain problems and advance autonomous trucking, I am extremely grateful for the support of the Ontario Government through AVIN and the Ontario Centre of Innovation. With their continued support, we are striving to position Canada as the leader in autonomous transportation,"" Sahdev said.

2021-03-12 22:28:40,stocks,"The most overvalued stock of 2021 - SEAS A while ago /u/cyphonismus made an excellent DD on one of the most clearly overvalued stocks on the market: [Seaworld Overvalued - SEAS](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lry7dt/seaworld_overvalued_seas/)

I recommend you read his DD first then come here. Seaworld has climbed from low $30s to $50+ in one month. $20 to $50+ in 6 months.

[This](https://imgur.com/s1WtnoL) graph sums it all up. Seaworld is in blue. Six Flags is in Yello. Even if you're extremely bullish on amusement parks, something is *seriously* wrong here.

&nbsp;

*How did it get this way?*

The small float at 50 million shares and incredibly high institutional ownership with low volume translates to it being easily manipulated. Institutions got lazy and let this thing slipway past where it should have gotten. Retail investors that are long on SEAS are rare and the ones remaining are going to pull out now.

In other words, if take your 💩 and make it look like a [chocolate bar](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Cadbury-Dairy-Milk-Caramel-Bar.jpg), no one will be any the wiser as long as they don't get close enough to sniff.

""Just skimming the fundamentals, this company looks like absolute dogshit."" -/u/ethandavid

Seriously, there is no bull argument at all for this being above $20, and this stock is starting to *stink*. 

Check out this article: [SeaWorld attendance dives 53% in the final quarter of 2020, but stock soars](https://www.orlandosentinel.com/business/tourism/os-bz-seaworld-earnings-covid-rebound-20210225-fs7wmwm3zrh7jlzwm5qdsbdz7y-story.html)

A small dip in the fake momentum and this thing comes **tumbling down**.

&nbsp;

*But what about the cute killer whales? I'm not evil!*

Watch Blackfish. It would be doing them a favor if SeaWorld was bankrupt.

Even without that knowledge, the company itself is run by some really scummy individuals. 

The starting wage at SeaWorld Orlando is current $11 an hour. Instead of raising the minimum wage, the CEO plans to ""increase automation efforts overtime"" to solve their cost problems. Not only are your Orca's being kept in a cage, but they also won't even pay the people to take care of them.

&nbsp;

*But we only know how to get tendies with undervalued stocks!*

Indeed young one, but everyone can learn. The bold get the tendies. 

You usually need to apply to get shorting approved on your margin account. Fidelity has a pretty quick turnaround time, so if SEAS is still above $40 by the time you get approved it can be a great play to make.

There is a lot of benefit to having at least one bear position in your portfolio. Probably even more than one right now.

Long puts work too, but I recommend shorting since it is less a question of *if* and more of a question of *when* the stock tanks. Even bankruptcy is not out of the question as /u/cyphonismus explained in his DD.

There is a reason hedgies love it.

Not your typical old-school dividend player as it is a Business Development Company (BDC) so it raises capital and invests in small and mid-size companies. It also pays 90% of its taxable income in dividends, similar to REITs. 

It has just been upgraded to Buy by Zacks (see below)

******************


Ares Capital (ARCC) Upgraded to Buy: Here's What You Should Know
Mentioned:	ARCC
Investors might want to bet on Ares Capital (ARCC), as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). An upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices -- has triggered this rating change.

The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company's changing earnings picture. The Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years is tracked by the system.

Individual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time. In these situations, the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements.

As such, the Zacks rating upgrade for Ares Capital is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price."

Luxury is becoming more unisex, not just women are interested in those products and brands.

More and more people can afford those products and will buy them in the future. Without wanting to delve deeper into the luxury brand business, there are two big players worldwide: Kering and LVMH. What strikes me about both of them is that they both have good margins, but they also have high valuations. The brands that belong to both companies can be found on Wikipedia. LVMH, for example, is the only one of the two with a significant presence in the alcohol business, so there are certain structural differences.

Which of the two companies would you prefer and why?"

It's in a classic bubble. Today the stock rose nearly 10% because the board revised earning projects and initiated a stock buyback. Not sure what factors have led this company to believe its earnings will be that good, when its business has been hugely impacted by the pandemic.

At its core, the Victoria Secret brand is a losing business. It's based in shopping malls, which are closing left and right and are on a tremendous decline. Its products are not unique, there are many other brands and stores selling same cheaply made underwear. The stock has had an average PE of about 12, right now its at 18. Retail industry is in a very tough spot, L Brands does not have a strong e-commerce presence.

Another hyped stock is AMC. It's been declining even BEFORE the pandemic, yet it became a meme and is rising. AMC is in a huge debt hole, with more than $11B in debt and $400M in cash. The interest on that debt is going to financially choke this company. It will be a penny stock."

2021-03-12 20:52:33,stocks,"Do your reading - The Roblox S1. (DD) Hello everyone. 

So, I've made a smattering of posts throughout the run up to Roblox's DPO yesterday about this company. I've been admittedly bullish on this company since I started looking into it, and honestly the caliber of the majority of Reddit chatter is only reinforcing my outlook and it made me want to throw my hat into the ring and at least get the word out there that there is a logical opinion behind the other side of the coin (as far as the opinions on the valuation and the stock in general). The amount of times people called their event an IPO when it was actually a DPO, the amount of times people thought that the underwriters would screw them on price not realizing it was a DPO or the parroting of ""they've never made a profit!""... It has driven me to finally address some of these points in my own post and at least have a discussion about this other side of the approach.

To introduce why, I am a hobbyist index investor with most of my money going into the big boring haystacks through my tax advantaged funds like anyone else. The difference is I've always allocated a nice but sustainable portion of my money to my ""fuck around fund"", which is aptly named but of course I still try to win with. Thanks to a darling niece who took my money and put it directly into Roblox more than once, I found this company and I personally think its a blockbuster and I'll tell you why. I'll also try to address some of the common tropes I've heard about them.

**My excitement:** When I was a kid, I lived and died off of flash games in the school computer lab. I could be playing one thing at lunch and then another thing in the next minute when I died, and I don't know about all of you but I spent hours on those games even when I got home. I had a PS1 and a PS2 later on but flash games always held my attention due to the sheer ease of access as well as the variety of games right up until their twilight.

Now, my first point is folks who have kids... listen to them. Everything I know about the actual product comes from watching my niece play and very nicely taking me through why she likes it so much. If my flash games were Bruce Banner, Roblox has taken this idea and turned it into the Incredible Hulk. The freedom to jump between literally hundreds and thousands of games (some very well built with character triggers and NPC's) while keeping your avatar consistent, not to mention that the games are usually multiplayer so she can play with her friends that jump between these games as well. She spends a lot of (my) money buying parts of outfits for her avatar, and this is where paying attention comes in. 

The store is well done, the experience is smooth enough for her to take me through it without needing my help by and large and honestly if I was a kid I would most likely be hopping on no question especially with friends on the platform. This is how I got so interested, along with wondering where my damn five bucks went when I just gave it to her a day ago!

[Before we begin, link to S1 to follow along.](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1315098/000119312521049767/d87104ds1a.htm)

**Things to understand about this company.**

------------------------------------------------

***Roblox is not a game, rather it is a platform***. It is the Youtube of games, so to speak. Your player character is customizeable and consistent through the games you play, and monetization is centered around in game purchases as well as the clothing and gear your character carries between worlds. If I have to hear ""a game is worth $40M in market cap?"", I'll bust a vein.

**Most if not all content now is user created**. Recently, they've allowed developers to make items and sell them on their marketplace. *According to their S1 they're on track to pay their developers ~$250M dollars.* Its a lot and I've seen people complain about how much they pay the content makers, but its a movie akin to Netflix (which is itself, not a movie but a platform) investing in their own native content.

**Bookings, Profitability and Free Cash Flow (S1 Reference page 77 and etc.)**

We believe bookings provide a timelier indication of trends in our operating results that are not necessarily reflected in our revenue as a result of the fact that we recognize the majority of revenue over the estimated average lifetime of a paying user.

To me, a lot of people have suddenly become really ""fundamentalist"" regarding the word revenue and I don't think you can move forward in this age of investing if you aren't up on technology and wildly different business models than we are used to. Revenue for me is a word that represents something, not a dogmatic ""well akshually according to the book"" type answer. What it represents is: how much money does this venture make? For Roblox, I think bookings is the best way to represent this and if you follow just revenue you're lost in the past on this company, plain and simple. Both for the creativity of the business model itself, as well as the consequence of the longer you wait and the more their bookings increases ahead of their reported revenue the higher you'll have to buy in. You lose money on this one if you can't grasp this.

Starting off, this business model is fairly simple. You buy their currency, ""Robux"", and then you buy stuff in game as well as in their general marketplace. You might have seen the giftcards at Safeway, and now they even sell premium accounts that give you some every month. But when you buy 5 Robux, your money doesn't instantly get turned into revenue. Instead its called bookings.

If you check page 77, they talk about how they believe (and they are right, I feel) that because of the way they are forced to recognize revenue that bookings is a superior method of looking at their trends of success. Simply, they can't recognize the money someone uses to buy their Robux until that person does one of two things. To recognize the money exchanged for Robux as revneue the user who bought the Robux then has to satisfy one of two conditions. They have to either buy a durable item like a piece of clothing off of the marketplace, or they have to buy AND consume something like an in-game potion. Until this is done, they can't call it revenue much like a lot of gift card type deals. 

If none of this happens, the money is spread as revenue over the average 22 month life of a user. But as you'll see, these motherfuckers brought in nearly $2 billion dollars and are sitting on a mountain of cash and after expenses are adding to this dragon's hoard. 

**~923 million in revenue, $1.8 billion in bookings, ~$411 million in free cash flow, own cash equivalents of $893 million, and the choice of a DPO.**

>This company isn't profitable, hurr!

>They haven't made a profit since 2007!

Frankly put, this company makes a boatload of cash and after spending on things like marketing, their own data centers (they own their data centers and don't rely on say AWS), employees, taxes, the apple store, the xbox store, and their developers they still have about $411 million in free cash flow. Lastly, the fat cherry on top is that they have cash sitting in the form of $893 million dollars! Does this sound like a company in need of money? 

Secondly, and this annoyed the shit out of me is if you search Roblox IPO vs. Roblox DPO in the reddit search you'll be able to see how many people continued referring to this as an IPO. This may seem unimportant, until you realize that the goal of an IPO and a DPO are completely different and symbolize two different types of companies. In an IPO, a company is raising money by issuing and selling new shares. *In a DPO, the company allows employees to sell their shares on the open market to allow for liquidity.* Roblox was allowing their OG's to finally turn their monopoly money into cash, and taking advantage of the publicity this brought.

Why is this important, and why is characterizing their public offering as an IPO so wrong? Because in addition to the strong numbers they exhibit, they didn't need to raise any money. If this doesn't speak to you, I don't know what will. 

**32% of their user base is currently bringing in 68% of the money.**

If you can take a look at Page 88, as well as reference page F-17 you'll find two very interesting facts that paint a huge opportunity for growth for them that is easily within reach based on their performance since their inception in 2007. 

Basically put, 68% of their daily active users were outside of the US and Canada regions. These include significant proven growth that's happened in France, South Korea, Germany, and other places besides. But the funny shit is, despite this fact monetization in the USA far outstrips their global bookings intake. This is a great problem to have, because just as Roblox grew to serve an American market and attract American content makers over time you can expect the same behavior especially as the company starts looking to market and invest in people outside of America. Translators, localization, all this kind of stuff takes time and once people start seeing content geared to them in their local culture they're inevitably going to spend more money.

Given this, its a huge road ahead. If everyone monetized like the USA this year, the bookings (aka money coming in from selling their Robux) would be something like $6 billion dollars and more!

**China**

Roblox just got a license to operate in China, the most populous nation on Earth with the largest middle class and the biggest market for mobile games. I don't... know how to make this bigger. Seriously, over a billion people who love mobile gaming and in-game purchases with more people with money looking to play every year. And now Roblox is in the door.

**>comparison to gaming company**

Do people compare Netflix to Miramax? That's how ridiculous someone sounds to me when they bring up Take Two Interactive (who brought in about $3 billion in revenue in 2020) in comparison to Roblox. Dude, they serve different needs. My niece has a Switch and finds time to play Roblox as well as garden her little world in Animal Crossing and in fact has played more Roblox that I've seen than her Switch by a large margin.

**>comparison to Unity**

Again, different customers and different company. Unity sells a great engine to game developers who then have to take the costs of hosting, development, marketing and publishing onto their shoulders. When you're publishing on Roblox, you have hosting and development largely taken care of thanks to their creation tools and engine. Not only that, but you have a ready audience for your game.

I think people reach to compare Roblox to Unity because they can't fathom understanding this company without these comparisons. Just because they sell entertainment in the form of gaming at the end, what goes into it is completely different. Its like buying your own cameras and shit compared to just using Netflix's shit to make a movie and then giving them a cut at the end of the day.

**>muh flash in the pan**

Roblox has been around since 2007. They've been encouraging people to make things on their platform for damn near fourteen years now. Minecraft, Fortnite? Dude, they're the ones who have to prove their staying power and not Roblox.

**>muh Minecraft**

If you still can't get it through your head that Minecraft is a game, and that Roblox is a game development hosting and creation platform and you're still drawing comparisons you need to stop reading here.

--------------------------------------

**TLDR: They make a lot of money and a lot of boomers just can't grasp a successful business model.** 

All in all, I'm in with my whole slush fund and I knew they would open at higher than 45. If you think their valuation of $29.5 billion was too rich for you, I think there is something you're failing to understand about this company. 

I for one wasn't surprised when they settled at a market cap of ~$39B recently. I also wasn't surprised to see Cathie Wood jump in, and you know why? Because these people can take an hour to see ""hey, what is this company like numbers wise""? Altimeter and Dragoneer were goddamn lucky to get in at $41, by a long shot. Their S1 is staring you in the face at the top of this post, go do yourself a favor and make a long play. 

Airbnb made $2.52 billion dollars, and is worth about ~$120 billion dollars. Zoom is projecting to be bringing in $2.3 billion dollars and as of my typing this is worth ~$103 billion dollars. Roblox, currently, is sitting on a full year of bookings of $1.8 billion dollars. I know money coming in isn't everything and that growth is accounted for in perception, but dude... they're got a clear path and make only $500M less than Zoom and is valued at 40% of their business. 

32% of their userbase makes up 68% of the money coming in, and their work is cut out for them. If they can monetize their expanding userbase in the way they monetized the USA, they don't even need to fucking age up. *If you ask me, they're undervalued and there is a lot of money to be made here.*

Roblox has components of a social network, a game, a marketplace, and a classroom. Its pretty astonishing, and I don't think I see Fortnite's developers making seminars to use Fortnite in the classroom. The metaverse, an idea I first heard in Snow Crash is what they're after. Imagine learning about the Coliseum in Rome by walking around it in your avatar that is the same one you used to shoot down goblins just earlier. And then using that same avatar to buy shoes in the official Jordan Roblox store, looking at a few ads on the way. Do you see where I'm going?

Don't miss the boat because you can't fathom something. The fundamentals and the vision are there. You'll regret it in two years when the stock is at $150 and you're stuck wondering if you should've actually read that S1 instead of listening to people who only see stocks as pump and dumps."

03/13/2021,stocks,"I spent so, so, so, so many hours on roblox as a kid between the age of 13-17. I never had a social life and I’ve always had a small friend group and we mostly just went home and got into Skype calls and played video games anyways, and I’ve always had a tendency to focus on one game at a time, and for me roblox was usually that game. I probably spent just as much time on roblox as I did going to school which I know is terrible, but it’s the truth. 

It’s hard to estimate a per hour wage for what I did. When I started selling I had the equivalent of 10 million ‘value’ in roblox which is different to robux as the trading scene on roblox has their own values for items that can be traded, but for ease of mind I’ll just say I had the equivalent of 10m robux. I slowly started to sell it off over the course of a year and made 20k cad around 16-17 years old probably, at this time I was still casually playing roblox and wasn’t completely focused on making money, but all of what I sold is built up over years of trading items on roblox just as a hobby with no intentions of ever making money. 

From the age of 17-19 I stopped really playing roblox as a hobby and more as a way to make money. At this point I wasn’t selling my own items anymore, I was buying from other people in the trading community on roblox and reselling on a third party market place, typically to younger children for usd, and this is when I started making a enough money to actually live off of it if I kept at it (though not sustainable for a long time). I could easily make 1k cad a week in profit if I had a good week. Hell one Christmas Day I made 2k in sales which netted me about 1,3k in profit. It was inconsistent but overall paid better than what either of my parents made. My best month I probably netted 4K cad in profit. For a 17-19 year old it was really good money. 

A lot of people won’t know this, but not too long ago there was a pretty interesting, albeit toxic community on roblox who spent their time buying and reselling items for usd. I know of a handful of people who actually made six figures a year doing it, and were around my age. I know of a couple of kids who were 14-16 who were making 40-60k USD a year doing this while also attending school."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Also forgot to mention but no my parents weren’t involved.

I would usually only withdraw it 2000$ at a time, and at one point that meant every week (not all of it was net profit). My parents knew how much I made because I had PayPal notifications on so whenever my phone went off and I was around them they knew it was likely PayPal since I didn’t have many people texting me haha. So they knew I was making money all the time and they knew roughly how much I had, but they were never involved with it."
03/13/2021,stocks,"As far as I’m aware they aren’t having any shortages of cash at all, in fact that’s why they did a direct listing instead of an ipo, because they simply don’t need the cash. I’m pretty sure they haven’t spent their bookings before move it into realized revenues and there’s no correlation between having to pay out developers after those unspent robux get spent, no idea where you got that idea. Basically my point is, they have plenty of cash and don’t need anymore, that’s the entire point of a direct listing instead of a traditional ipo. They have enough cash and there’s no worries there. 

Fair valuation is probably around 19b in this company lol, you’re either being sarcastic or have no idea what you’re talking about."
03/13/2021,stocks,">I’m pretty sure they haven’t spent their bookings before move it into realized revenues

They have.  Their booking are over double their cash on hand.  You are disagreeing with their financial statements.  Unless you think they are committing securities fraud you are wrong.  

>pay out developers after those unspent robux get spent

Developers get 30% of every single robux spend on their game.  So for every single unspent robux there is an associated 30% liability.  If the developers decide they want the cash receipts block has to pay them. They will have the cash now due to share sales but it's the first time in years that's true.  


>Basically my point is, they have plenty of cash and don’t need anymore, that’s the entire point of a direct listing instead of a traditional ipo. 

No.  That's not what it means at all.  Yes they have plenty of cash but that's because they just sold more shares in January.  The point of a DPO is actually to save money on IPO costs while raising more funds for the company. 

>Fair valuation is probably around 19b in this company

Probably closer to half of that.  Their business model of paying out developers a cut of sales does not scale all that well.  It also leaves your company entirely reliant on a fickle community which is another negative for them."

Is this a legit fear for the economy? Not at all. Its only going to be temporary inflation as Jpow said. The fact that we are spending more right now than in 2020 is perfectly normal and healthy.


But wanna bet that the media will push this ""inflation"" rise? They're going to say ""SEE WHAT DID WE SAY, INFLATION!"". Some hedge funds will move their money to safer stocks, some new investors will panic sell, and we should see some small corrections.


What does this mean for us?


It might be an ok idea at the beginning of april to keep some cash on hand, or invest in things less affected by inflation fears... and once it dips because of the CPI report, then it could make sense to buy the dip... except that we will probably get a second bad report in May (April 2021 will obviously have more spending than april 2020).

Tencent is a Chinese company that is the gatekeeper for all video games in China. They are the largest gaming company in the world and they also own WeChat. 

Notable gaming companies in Tencent's portfolio include

Yes Tencent owns 49% of Roblox.

Hell, the US attempted two coups against democratically elected governments in South America during just the last presidency alone, and our current president is currently happily bombing Syria, a country that we are not at war with.

This is without even going into the fact that the US has the highest percentage of its own citizens imprisoned than any nation in the history of human civilization, or that the US intelligence services have a massive apparatus to spy on its own citizens courtesy of the Patriot Act."

2021-03-12 20:25:01,stocks,"Can someone explain Private Placements to me? I mean, I understand what happens. It’s a deal made off the market and it’s more beneficial for the company, more direct. But I’m talking in terms of price. 

Do PP’s typically move a stock in the positive direction? Or somehow the other way? 

Say a stock is trading at .43 cents. 

The stock opens the next day dropped off 30% down to .30 range. 

Then, shortly after the drop they announce a 25 Million Dollar PP @.30 with Warrants to buy more at .40. 

Could that drop somehow have been related to the deal being made at .30? 

Does the company issues new shares in these situations meaning they aren’t bought right off the open market? And thus won’t affect the price directly?  

Like, for instance. My brain wants to think in the mentioned situation that: 

‘Ok, the stock was trading at .43, they had a lunch date or whatever and decided .30 would be where the deal was made. So they drove the price down from .43 to .30 to pick up his friends and his 25 Million Dollars in stock at that set price and then once they’re on board this thing will take off.’

Is that how this works? Or is it more like: 

‘We’re off the market and we like what you’re doing and know you need capital so here gimme 25 Million Dollars worth of shares at say .30 with warrants to buy more at .40 and you just get this capital NOW to do whatever you gotta do.’ 
 
As in, is it a sign of weakness like a company is needing money? 

But, I guess even in that situation that means the investor believes the stock will go up if he exercises warrants to buy more at a higher price.. 🤷🏼‍♂️🤔

If you wait until after the split has happened to buy in, you sort of miss the split party. Of course, after the split, eventually it will start to pick up as well, because retail investors will see it as a better buy.

2021-03-12 20:10:43,stocks,"Past S&P 500 chart tells a different story then the narrative that we hear today I know there are some people here that have been around (investing) a lot longer than I have. I have only been heavily following the stock market since 2008. In the last 10 or so years I have constantly heard the narrative ""stocks only go up."" I have people around me that pull up the 10 year S&P 500 chart to prove how it is a no brainer to leave your money in the stock market. The media continually tells you active traders fail and index funds are a much better bet. The problem I see is that those statistics are all within the last 10 years typically. I also would like to point out that in the past there have been ACTUAL bear markets where your money did not move like it has in the last 10 years. Here are some interesting time spans going from the dot com bubble (yes I know how unique the dot com bubble was) to the following 12 years:

1/1/2000 to 1/1/2007 - $10,000 became $10,782.77 - Roughly 1% annual return over 7 years

1/1/2007 to 1/1/2012 - $10,000 became $9,912.96 - Roughly -.1% annual return over 5 years

Had you ""bought and held"" from 1/1/2000 to 1/1/2012 your .5% annual return would have left a bit to be desired.

Here is another interesting one. Let's say you bought at the bottom of the dot com bust in 2003 only to watch it all go away in 2009.

1/1/2003 to 1/1/2009 - $10,000 became $10,483.04 - Roughly .75% annual return in 6 years.

I realize those are some ""worst case"" scenarios but we don't even realize this as a possibility in ""investment circles"" today. Anyone talking about stocks and investments reference the last 10 years and it is always something positive (or flat). Maybe you have the people who pulled out at the bottom of the covid plunge but most people were wired to ""ride it out"" already and had a fairly large savings account. 401k plans didn't empty out like they thought it would. Today it is just a matter of ""when"" the stock price increases not a matter of ""if"" the stock price increases. Some will argue if you ""bought an held"" from 1/1/2000 to 1/1/2021 you would have $35,714.74 dollars. A roughly 6 percent yearly return. Though I would argue if you had bought in 2012 you would have same the returns as the guy who started investing in the 99-00s. This makes those 10 year investors extra bullish. It actually looks like this:

1/1/2012 to 1/1/2021 - $10,000 became $33,412.88 - Roughly 14% annual return over 9 years

My point is that humans forget very quickly. The people who have gotten involved in the stock market in the last 10 years have had a completely different perspective. They have seen double digit returns and never experienced a year over year loss of any real significance (2018 is about as bad as it got at a 4% loss). The traders that just set up an account in the last 12 months are even more jaded. The stock market recovered from a total shut down of the economy to provide a 17% gain on the S&P for the year of 2020.

If you are with me this far hoping for some interesting conclusion I don't have one. I don't know what the future brings. Timing the market is impossible. I am not saying we are doomed. I do think we are incredibly dependent and aware of the stock market moves nowadays. A year or two of actually bleeding losses in a bear market would be more devastating than it was in the past. Having all your losses occur in 60 days (Covid Crash) is not the same as buying dip after dip for 24 months only to have it move down further a week later. After 2020 people may even believe that if the stock market were to crash the government will always fix it. Even 2008 set the stage for that.

I will say a big help to the stock market is every retail investor that has come into the market in the last few years. More money in makes prices go up whether the company is worth more or not. Though those retail investors will leave a lot quicker than the retirement plans that typically made up the common persons stock market dollars in the past.

TL;DR Stocks don't always go up. Even if you wait an entire year.  


Edit: Yes given enough time stocks will go up. Inflation alone increases the dollar valuation of a company. This post is intended for those getting into the market over the last year or even couple of years. Believing that you will have the returns you have seen the last couple of years is not a good picture of the long term market. Even if you were in an index like the S&P 500.

The recent bull market has people who are within a decade or two of their planned retirement counting on an income from stocks. They might think they're safe buying the index, but they're not. They might think they're safe buying ""value"" stocks like Johnson Johnson and CVS and Verizon, but they're not. Nearly all stocks dropped by an average of 50% or more during the crashes of 2000 and 2008 and did not recover until 5 to 10 years later. For most people, there's no back up because they've relied on FIRE calculations that are average rather than worst case.

This really has more to do with the sorry state of the US's social safety net, than anything else. Social security is in ruins. Pensions are a concept of the past. 401k relies on the market for inflation correction because bond yields are crap. More than half of Americans live from pay check to pay check. People are desperate for anything that'll give them solid returns.

It's a damned if you do, damned if you don't scenario - if you don't invest in the market, your savings aren't enough for you to live off of because of **** wages and high taxes. But if you do invest in the market, your retirement plans can be destroyed in one red moment. With an over heated property market, stocks are the last refuge of the American middle class. If it collapses like in 2000 or 2008, many, many people are going to have to work through retirement, but how long do you figure that can last? 65? 70? Who's going to hire a 70 year old?

I hate to say it but I think we're about one or two big sustained market crashes away from the end of the US as we know it. Even if the economy keeps on growing, if 80% of Americans are faced with bankruptcy during retirement, this system is going to collapse."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Agree agree agree.

BUT no period in history has seen such a one way direction of interest rates over the last 40 years.  Obviously that has affected market returns as things are simply priced much much higher for the same amount of earnings.  Given as you point out that we are near zero...we won’t replicate that.  So even if we stay at zero, future returns are probably pricing in a 4-6% overall return at most now.  Vastly different.  

I do say this though as someone who is near fully invested and is not a bear, I just expect long term returns to be 5% or less average for 20 years because of this"

03/13/2021,stocks,"Completely agree on the sorry state of the US social safety net. Social Security could be so easily fixed--or at least largely addressed--by raising the cap (maximum taxable amount) and reducing benefits for well-off retirees that don't need them. Meanwhile, we're all hostage to Wall Street.

That said, even if you have 20 years to retirement, now is not the time to go conservative. The experts say you should shift to bonds, cash, possibly fixed indexed annuities the closer you get to retirement, to protect yourself against a crash. I think that's right. The other thing you need to consider is that even if the market crashes right as you're retiring, you still probably have a decade or a few to live, so going completely out of the market isn't wise-- you'll still need retirement income. At 40, using the 120-your age rule of thumb, you should be 80% equity, 20% bonds. If you're more conservative, rule of thumb is 60-40. Again, its not like you're just investing before the crash and then stopping. If you add to positions over the next 20 years, you'll come out ahead.

Yes, the market could crash right before retirement, but if you've shifted to at least 60% bonds or more by that time, like you're supposed to, the impact will be muted.

Since then, they've all gone up, and the $20 range ones are now in their $30s, but as you can imagine, the gains  are nominal.

FYI, I'm looking to invest for mid-long term.  These stocks that I purchased were when I was first starting out, and I took ""diversifying"" very literally with the amount I had."
03/13/2021,stocks,"percent gains are percent gain. Whether you spread it out over multiple stocks or dump it all in one. 

If you start with $1000:

Put it all on a $50 stock, you get 20 shares. If that stock goes up 10%, it is worth $55. $55 x20= $1,100. 

Which, in an odd twist of math, is also a 10% gain from your $1,000 

Put it on 10 stocks worth $10 each. you have 10 shares each. if the stock goes up to $11 you have 10 stocks each worth $110. 

which then equals, $1,100.

  
The issue at hand is a question of risk and diversification. owning just one stock could maximize returns if that stock has great gains. but the same goes for losses. owning multiple stocks can limit your ceiling (potentially) but you can also offset losses in one stock with gains in another."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Yes, I do just this

I actually have around 50 different positions, including various ETFs

Some are very stable but solid long term picks like GM and MRVL. Others are much more speculative like ATOM and ATNF. I usually have many more of the former, stable ones than the latter. 

I never buy all in one transaction. Fee free brokerages have made it easy and viable for me to ""scale in"" and ""scale out"" as needed. Basically, dollar cost average in

My rationale for having so many stocks is simple. It doesn't take a lot for your overall portfolio to outperform -- just one or two stocks that make up, say, 3 percent of your portfolio doubling over the course of the year means a 3 percent gain on your portfolio even if all of your other stocks didn't move at all. Also, I have FOMO and want to own ALL the stocks and not miss out on possible metoeric rise. This addresses that for sure. It also spreads out risk. And some will make that wild move up over time -- let your runners run, and cut your losers early! 

When I see stocks I like go on sale, I sell off the more stable ones and buy those more speculative ones. Ths is similar to what the ARK funds did in the recent selloff in growth stocks

This works well for me. Do remember, though, that what you're saying about ""cheap"" doesn't matter. A stock is ""cheap"" not because of its arbitrary share price. The share price being 3 before a reverse split vs 6 after a reverse split didn't change how ""cheap"" it was or percent gained. Always focus on the percent gain. Also look at what market caps are and how to value a stock. Fractional shares make it easy for you to buy .1 of a share in TSLA vs 2 shares in GM -- one isn't cheaper than the other because of its share price.

This is how people get trapped in penny stocks, thinking that GSAT is cheap for being only a few bucks when really its market cap is well above 2 billion IIRC."

However I rest assured knowing her fund knows how to capitalize on bear markets, they accelerate out of retractions because they use them as opportunities to concentrate into the most valuable positions

If I lose money on something like that, oh well (agree on never selling somethings for insight). it’s helpful to look back and see why my investment was bad and more often then not learned much more than if I were to made money."

So who can solve it?

* TSM

* AMAT

* QCOM

The question is when. I'm heavily invested in all 3 companies here, but we're still on a downtrend due to the shortage.

What are your plans to capture the ramp up in production to get this problem under control?"
03/13/2021,stocks,Easy way to play it is a semiconductor ETF like SMH
03/13/2021,stocks,"Infineon makes the discrete simple semis needed in autos that their is a shortage of. They also have their own fabs.

03/13/2021,stocks,"It might be best to avoid the dependent/impacted industries in favor of lower tech ones (i.e. investing in a home builder instead of an auto company) or moving down the supply chain towards basic materials which would be less impacted.

Another play might be companies that are more vertically integrated owning their own fabs like SNE, INTC, and MU.

The other thing to think about is that software is the flip side of hardware, so if they can't get exactly the right chip that does exactly what they need the companies may need to rewrite their code to run on the chip that is available.  So companies that support software development."
03/13/2021,stocks,What about KLAC? They work in semiconductor inspection and metrology. My beginner DD picked this as one of the best ways to profit off semiconductors. This is one no else seems to talk about though...

UMC because it's low priced and they are actually already *in* the automobile chip making business which is where a major part of the chip shortage is.  Logic being UMC is a low priced player in a segment where demand is very high.

MRVL simply because they're an American company and exactly the type of company the Biden administration is pushing to improve with regard to American tech manufacturing.  (Pure speculation there because I do not know of any specific government deals or assistance.  I just know it's something that could be coming over the next 4-8 years... And I know you buy *ahead* of the news.)  Also, 92% institutional ownership lets you know the big guys like the numbers and the volatility is a little lower.

SOXL is a solid long term play right now because of the shortage, but it’s not for cowards"
03/13/2021,stocks,The shortage of chips and future need is already priced in. Hence why semiconductor stocks have been on a tear for months. There will be future gains but not like what was seen last year.
03/13/2021,stocks,"I’m not saying you’re wrong necessarily, but can you direct me to reputable sources discussing exactly how this has been “priced in” and how it was determined? I mean at best all it can really be is a guesstimate based on the current situation as it stands right now, right? It just doesn’t make sense to me is all. How can it be priced in when no one knows how the shortage is going to be addressed yet, or what the future demand will look like before knowing how they’re going to fix the supply chain, and in what timeframe? Wouldn’t the recent tear of these companies be due to the shortage itself, which no doubt will signal people to invest, and because they increased prices so much in responseThis isn’t the same as 2018 where they were overbought, there literally aren’t enough. The demand is still increasing and at best it will take several quarters to catch up. I’m not saying it’s going to only go up forever, but until a plan is in place to correct this, and to prevent future shortages, I don’t think anyone can accurately say what it’s going to do. 
It’s the same for me as people saying the most recent stimulus bill was priced in in November once Biden won the election. They didn’t know what the bill would entail, where the money would be allocated, or even if it would pass. Sure, it was very likely, but not a sure thing. I guess my broader point would be, just because something is priced in, is it really that meaningful as things can, and do change constantly?"

The lawsuit seeks to recover damages for investors under the federal securities laws.

The Complaint alleges that Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) the Company was merely hoping that USPS was going to select an electric vehicle as its Next Generation Delivery Vehicle, and had no assurance or indication from USPS that this was the case; (2) the Company had concealed the fact that -- as revealed by the postmaster general in explaining the ultimate decision not to select an electric vehicle -- electrifying the USPS's entire fleet would be impractical and astronomically expensive; and (3) as a result, Defendants' statements about Workhorse's business, operations, and prospects were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.

Investors who purchased or otherwise acquired shares of Workhorse during the Class Period should contact the Firm prior to the May 7, 2021 lead plaintiff motion deadline.

2021-03-12 19:43:30,stocks,"Apple is a 'best idea' pick that can rally up to 86% as tech stocks rebound, Wedbush says $AAPL * **Wedbush named Apple one of its ""best ideas"" stocks after recent selling set up a ""great entry point.""**
* **Strong quarterly figures and demand in Asia can lift shares even as investors shift to value names, analyst Dan Ives said.**
* **The firm holds a bull-case price target of $225, implying an 86% surge from Tuesday's closing price.**
* [**Sign up here for our daily newsletter, 10 Things Before the Opening Bell**](https://newsletter.businessinsider.com/join/4np/10-things-opening-bell?utm_source=markets&utm_medium=ingest?utm_source=markets&utm_medium=ingest)**.**

The tech stocks that led the market higher in 2020 are faring worse this year. Wedbush sees it as a perfect opportunity to scoop up the group's biggest name.

Investors gearing up for a swift economic rebound have recently dumped growth stocks for riskier plays. The broad rotation to value stocks has dragged on tech mega-caps and sparked wild shifts between heavy selling and sudden dip-buying. While the Nasdaq composite notched a massive 3.7% gain on Tuesday, the biggest tech stocks still boast year-to-date losses.

The weakness sets up a ""great entry point"" for investors interested in [**Apple**](https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/aapl-stock?utm_source=markets&utm_medium=ingest), Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note. The firm added Apple to its ""best ideas"" list on Wednesday, praising the company's blowout December-quarter results and growth in Asia. After exceeding expectations for iPhone 12 sales, the iPhone 13 could be a ""game-changer"" that extends the upgrade ""supercycle"" for another year, Ives said.

""The recent sell-off creates a golden buying opportunity with a $3 trillion valuation on the horizon for Cupertino in our opinion,"" he added.

Wedbush reiterated its ""outperform"" rating with a $175 price target. The firm also holds a bull-case target of $225, which implies an 86% surge from Tuesday's closing level.

Wall Street expects Apple to ship roughly 220 million iPhones in the current fiscal year. Ives holds a considerably rosier outlook, instead projecting sales can rise to a record 250 million.

The bullish estimate is partially fueled by expectations for millions of current iPhone owners to upgrade their phones throughout the year. Some 350 million of the 950 million iPhones worldwide are due for an upgrade, according to Wedbush. The dynamic stands to prop up demand into the fall, Ives said.

The upgrade supercycle could even last through 2022 if iPhone 13 rumors prove true, the analyst added. Supply chain reports signal Apple initially aims to build 100 million units of the upcoming model, up from 80 million for the iPhone 12 lineup.

While this number is subject to change, the reports hint at ""an increased confidence with Cook & Co. that this 5G product cycle"" will continue into next year, Ives said.

Apple closed at $121.08 on Tuesday, down 9.4% year-to-date. The company has 81 ""buy"" ratings, 15 ""hold"" ratings, and three ""sell"" ratings from analysts."
03/13/2021,stocks,"How did they discover this hidden gem? Never heard of ‘em. They sell fruit?

EDIT: Something hidden in the 10-Q that I like for Apples continued growth (and accelerating margin): China. Page 21 of the most recent 10-Q shows China revenue grew 56% y/y, from 14.7% to 19.1% of the total top line. Meanwhile operating income grew 59% y/y, expanding operating margin from 39.4% to 40.0%. This is WELL AHEAD of the 34.1% operating margin in the US. As the middle class in China grows in the coming decades, the installed base and revenue per user here will explode.

Additionally, Apples margin (in all countries) will continue to expand as the mix shifts more towards services."

03/13/2021,stocks,"Not true. Apple has released an Apple TV app on other platforms to compete with Netflix and other streaming services.

Apple Music is also available on Android to compete with Spotify and Play Music."
03/13/2021,stocks,"It’s funny because Apple and Google are the reason those companies no longer exist. 

This is a horrendous comparison. Number one the age we live in right now is considerably different. This isn’t 2001. 

Advertising is web based now. Google also owns YouTube, Waymo and has a growing cloud business among so much ai and other parts. Yahoo was a crappy web news page with no search algorithm. 

Nokia? Back then the cell phone was just emerging and an extremely fragmented market. It was not a computer, camera and not to mention what the apps that run on the phone do. Also China was not a consumer then. There’s a reason black berry phones don’t exist anymore. Apple killed them. Like they killed Ericson and Nokia. 

GE ran its self into the ground by selling parts it owned, just to watch them grow. They then made horrible purchases and their past CEO ran the company into the ground and left it with a crappy power business and a ton of debt."

03/13/2021,stocks,"I guess I don’t see how you can think AAPL is stupidly overpriced, no matter what you think of their products. 

I mean their profit is just insane. They make so much money they don’t know what to do with it other than buy back shares.

03/13/2021,stocks,"Have you heard of Tile? I know many people that use it, and I imagine if Apple brands it and possibly bundles it with iPhones/Devices for a more intriguing price (which will already be expensive, because... Apple), then it will certainly be profitable."
03/13/2021,stocks,"In 2017, iPhone users discovered that iOS artificially limited processor speeds as phone batteries aged. This was meant to stop real problems with performance, since it reduced stress on the battery and could prevent accidental shutdowns. But Apple didn’t reveal the feature’s existence, leading people to believe their phones were simply slowing down from age. In lawsuits, users claimed that they bought all-new devices to fix the problem — but if they’d known about this feature, they could have replaced the battery instead."
03/13/2021,stocks,When they made older phones perform worse. Something related to software throttling battery capacity? Iirc it was maybe the around the 7?
03/13/2021,stocks,"More diversified portfolio of products (cloud, possible Leadership in AI) and Microsoft also for their cloud platform and for being leading software supplier."
03/13/2021,stocks,Yeah I was joking.  I hope that guy doesn’t do that.
03/13/2021,stocks,"Fair enough I guess. I will commend AAPL fans for not massively downvoting me for not being mega bullish on the stock. When I wasnt excited about TSLA in the high $800s it was not a pretty picture.

I will reiterate that I do like AAPL. I would be doing CSPs on it, but they don't make enough for  my taste. Ill stick with CCs for now."

03/13/2021,stocks,"They buyback about $100billion+ per year. Last quarter I think it was just under $28billion. Not too shabby.

The commenter is not saying buybacks will push the market so to $4trillion, just that the buybacks mean share price going up has less total impact on the market cap than if they did not buy back so many shares."
03/13/2021,stocks,I am not trying to be rude or anything but I think you don’t understand how buybacks work. Buybacks do NOT affect market cap. At the rate Apple is buying back shares its possible in a year or two for their share price to double while still maintaining a 2 trillion dollar market cap. When Apple does buybacks it increases the share price while also increasing the shareholders ownership in the company. This is because Apple is removing shares from the market thus creating less supply and more demand. None of this affects the market cap of the company. If Apple was not doing any buybacks I still think the share price could double and they can hit that 3 trillion market cap but it would probably take more time but who knows. Apple is opening its first stores in India this year so its another huge market place and growth potential for Apple.
03/13/2021,stocks,Buy backs are not done to push up the price of the shares. They are done to increase value for shareholders. Every share Apple buys back means each remaining share is now worth a larger % of the total company.
03/13/2021,stocks,"Apple buys back their shares at a rapid pace because they don't have another project with a higher IRR (not because they don't have good ideas but because they make so much profit in excess of their project needs) and they don't do any crazy, unprofitable ""Other Bets"" a la Google. I think Apple will beat the market but I don't see a double happening for 2 or 3 years, still fantastic returns. For the record, Buffett has sold 10% of his stake the last 2 Q's and I suspect he still might be, though it's still close to 44% of BRK and he still thinks it's ""the best business in the world""."

Wood only looks out 5 years. Buffett understood that Apple Wasnt tech, when he made the investment. It’s brand is a moat of its own. 

Google is growth at all costs. Which Amazon pioneered. This wasn’t happening 20 years ago. Almost just 8 years ago you were embarrassed to say you owned Amazon because it was not profitable and had no desire to be. But they went all out to grow to the point that they hit the tipping point, of where they were the best option and revenue exploded. Google does the same thing. Which is why governments want to break them up. But let them. YouTube would be the biggest IPO in history and Waymo would immediately be worth 25 billion.

03/13/2021,stocks,"Apple isn't overpriced. That's a widely told misconception. It's just everything else is under priced, but they get their money on other ways. Apple operates on an average of like 30-35% margin for their main products(dongles are overpriced and the margins are huge there), so Apple computers and phones are actually reasonably priced. 

Seriously, the tech industry is full of business selling their services at cost, at loss and even free, because they'll either put bloatware on their shit, or sell your info. Apple doesn't do any of that for the most part and still has the smoothest experience an OS can offer at the moment. 

Personally, I'd rather be charged upfront for something and then not have all that hidden nonsense."
03/13/2021,stocks,Holy Christ I guess people don't like a realist? Apple increased 3-fold during this pandemic for no reason. The moment a  (new) competitor takes their market share they are nothing. Your comment is so reasonable. People are delusional.

03/13/2021,stocks,"Yes share buybacks make the shares rise in price. When apple starts buying shares, it increases demand, and decreases supply, thus causing an increase in price."
03/13/2021,stocks,"They money they use is a portion of their ridiculous amounts of profit obviously. A big part of their job is to create value for shareholders. Stock buybacks are one way to do this.

While buy backs can affect the share price, it is not done to affect the share price so much as the share VALUE. Let’s say Company A has 100 shares outstanding listed on the NYSE. You own 50 of them, meaning you own 50% of the company. They buy back 10 shares. There are now only 90 shares outstanding. Now you own over 55% of the company.

Obviously this example is using incredibly small numbers, but hopefully this helps you understand what share buy backs do for shareholder value."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Agreed. You pay around $700 for a phone but it’ll last 5-7 years before you need a new one. Whereas Androids only last about half that.

I don't think so, the current price is about the same as when all those rumors started this year. Honestly, I haven't seen anyone hyped or dreading the idea, it probably won't affect the price until we see something tangible."

03/13/2021,stocks,"Ok.  So they don't get 60 shares and me 40?  It just reduces the outstanding market value?  And now I have 55% ownership?

They don't really buy shares, but rather just reduce their market share?"
03/13/2021,stocks,"In your example wouldn't you still own 50% of the company, but now you own 55% of the outstanding shares. The bought back shares still exist but now they are treasury shares."
03/13/2021,stocks,"I hope that’s true, but I was wondering if they basically just offset the lack of new products this year.

Not that an announcement wouldn’t give the stock a huge surge, but maybe not as much as we’d hoped.

I just bought some leaps during this dip so hope that will be a big jump but I want to temper my expectations"
03/13/2021,stocks,"I was being hyperbolic of course. 

If you're going to argue something was designed on an Apple product as your argument then why aren't you claiming that Microsoft isn't worth 10x Apple when their platform is where 90% of things are designed and developed on? Not to mention the backbone of the entire world's technology economy. 

It's hard to argue that someone using an iPhone to do something literally every other phone can do as being a reason it's intertwined in my life. Those interactions would have gone the exact same way whether or not they were using an iPhone. The irony that you've mentioned interacting with a Google and Facebook product as counting as interacting with Apple is pretty funny to me though. 

Even then your examples are even less relevant to my life as I've never used Instagram or tiktok, and only rarely watch YouTube videos."
03/13/2021,stocks,"They just keep it. They basically take it out of circulation. 

Think about it like this. A share is a small part of the company. If you own a share, you own a part of the company. 

Apple owns most of itself, meaning they own most of the shares. Any time they want to gain even more ownership, they buy more shares. Any time they need more money, they sell their shares, thus reducing their ownership in the company."
03/13/2021,stocks,"No it reduces the shares outstanding, I was trying to simplify it for you. However since the company owns the shares, and you own the company your ownership stake has, in fact increased."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Yes exactly, you would own 55% of shares outstanding. The comment you are replying to is purposefully as simplistic as possible to help the person asking about the effect of share buybacks understand.

In addition, since the company owns the shares, and you own the company your true ownership has increased, though it is by a smaller percentage. Again I was just using a purposefully simplistic example."
03/13/2021,stocks,Lots of new Apple products debuted in the last 12 months. Including the most exciting computers since the original iMacs.
03/13/2021,stocks,">why aren't you claiming that Microsoft isn't worth 10x Apple when their platform is where 90% of things are designed and developed on?

I wasn't really making any sort of comment in regard to the valuation of the companies, merely their influence on our day to day lives and how the person you were arguing with likely used hyperbole.

>Even then your examples are even less relevant to my life as I've never used Instagram or tiktok, and only rarely watch YouTube videos.

I don't care to take the time to analyze your personal life to figure out where Apple products affect you.   Those were examples of how those who don't spend money can still be affected.   

I'm not sure you're really arguing in good faith, so I'll leave it at that."
03/13/2021,stocks,"So the market value stays the same but just the outstanding shares are reduced making me own more?  Ok.  I think I get it, but it sounds complicated."
03/13/2021,stocks,"I’m sure I’m making it harder than it is. If this happens the amount of shares stays the same it’s just that the company owns more of them now. I own a higher percentage of the shares outstanding but I’m not seeing how that gives me more ownership in the company as a result? Seems like if the shares just vanished then it would. But they didn’t vanish, just were pulled off the market by the company. What am I missing?"
03/13/2021,stocks,Gotcha was making sure I didn't miss something when you said you now own 55% of the company.
03/13/2021,stocks,"Sorry, I thought you were OP who was arguing their valuation. 

I just fundamentally disagree with your assessment that someone else using a particular piece of hardware to use software that is available on all hardware means its intertwined in my life in any meaningful way when I don't use the hardware myself. Such a broad definition of intertwined would mean nearly everyp roduct in existence is intertwined in my life because I've interacted with someone else that uses it. 

I'm not sure how my argument is not being made in good faith? I honestly believe this sub (and the market) fundamentally doesn't understand Apple as a company and as such it is grossly overvalued and considered a safe long term investment when it shouldn't be."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Yep. Here it is simplified: say there's only 10 shares outstanding representing the whole value of the company, $10. If the company buys back 5 of their shares, the remaining shareholders now have twice as much of the company without the market cap changing. If the company is worth $10, now each share is worth $2, a double."
03/13/2021,stocks,">I'm not sure how my argument is not being made in good faith?

Came across this way when your original comment was essentially attacking the hyperbolic element of their comment.

>I just fundamentally disagree with your assessment that someone else using a particular piece of hardware to use software that is available on all hardware means its intertwined in my life in any meaningful way when I don't use the hardware myself.

I can see the argument you're trying to make.  If I take you're statements at face value then you have no experience using Apple's products; maybe you're not the best to evaluate them?  Are you just bearish about tech in general?"
03/13/2021,stocks,"I’m trying to understand all this too. I’m a newer investor. In your example, that in and of itself won’t raise the share price right? It would cut their market cap in half but in doing that it doesn’t raise what the price of each share is. However, given that the market cap was double what it is now (before they bought back five shares) ideally, people will recognize that and buy more shares which is going to push the share price back up to a point where the market cap is where it was previously? Is that correct?

In addition I think someone mentioned that this results in shareholders owning more of the company. I’m not sure I’ve wrapped my head around that. Saw an example where say there’s 100 outstanding shares and I own 50 of them giving me 50% of the available shares. They buy back 10 and now I own 55% of the outstanding shares. Does that increase my ownership in the company? I mean, the shares are not gone it’s just that the company owns them now. I see that I own a higher percentage of the available shares but I’m not sure how that translates to me owning more of the company as a result. Maybe I’m making this more difficult than it is"
03/13/2021,stocks,So buybacks raise the price per share then.
03/13/2021,stocks,"I've used them more than I've wanted to. I find them mediocre and extremely over priced. They get maintain relevance with a world class marketing department, not superior product offerings. They're very good at taking someone else's innovations and making them ""cool"" but I don't believe any company can maintain market relevance long term with that method. Eventually someone will figure out how to make something cool that makes them irrelevant before they can copy it, or they will simply lose their cool factor as tastes change, just like the last time they almost went under.   
 
 



I'm not bearish on tech at all, but I do think Apple is at or near their peak and it will all start going downhill for them in the next 10 or so years. iPhone sales will stop growing, and they'll start making more and more desperate developments (like their EV) and bad acquisitions to try and stay relevant and burn through that cash stockpile they have. They'll collapse quickly under their own weight."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Buying back shares doesn't change the market cap *by itself*. When a company buys its own shares it's taking them out of circulation completely, so the existing shareholders own a bigger piece of the pie. It's like the shares never existed, they don't go onto the company's balance sheet. If the company's earnings and growth rate stayed the same, there wouldn't be any reason for the market cap to be cut in half.

Remember earnings and the velocity of earnings (growth rate) is what drives valuations. When a company buys back shares there are now less shares on the market, which translates into higher earnings per share (*all other metrics being the same*), which translates into the share price going up. 

The 'Education' section of Investopedia really helped me wrap my head around a lot of this stuff. I highly recommend it, it's very comprehensive."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Yeah, all other things being the same, that's the end result. It's a way of increasing shareholder value without triggering capital gains tax like a quarterly dividend would incur—you only get taxed when you sell. Great companies like Apple (of which there are few) oftentimes do billions in buybacks *and* a dividend."
03/13/2021,stocks,See my [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m3mte1/z/gqtqvzx) to this dude as well :)
03/13/2021,stocks,"Thanks for the explanation. That makes sense. I was thinking once they bought back the shares they still existed but only as like “private” shares if you will. I know there’s an official term for shares that aren’t in the float but I’m drawing a blank. Anyway if they are just gone then that makes sense how the value of every other share held would go up. 

The part I’m not getting is how a buy back doesn’t change the market cap by itself? If a company buys shares back and effectively removes them from circulation, now shares outstanding is lower and market cap would have to be lower as a result instantly given market cap = share price * shares outstanding?

Thanks for the investopedia suggestion. I do need to spend a weekend and just start reading"

03/13/2021,stocks,"If you're back to pre-covid levels, I'd get out and enjoy the cash.  Chances are even these airlines ran up debt, etc.

Additionally, keep in mind that a large part of airline travel is business.  Many companies are going to significantly shift their business travel for years to come.  I know you're saying they don't depend on it ""as much"", but it will still subtract revenue to some extent.

So stock split today, my one contract became 10. And the stock went up 6%, that's really sweet, doubled the value. My question is, do stocks usually go up for multiple days after split? I'm debating whether to take profit. Anyone who experienced the TESLA split, can you share some advice? appreciate it."
2021-03-12 19:19:36,stocks,"The Nasdaq may be looking at a low of 10% down (relative to today) Without making this too long, the losses aren’t over yet. Yields are a big deal, especially for tech stocks. Even if yields top out around where they were before COVID, that still leaves the Nasdaq around 35% higher than it was before Covid. That’s a big discrepancy. All of that 35% in gains has to be accounted for with any combination of the following 3 things:
- a) actual economic growth for tech stocks
- stock losses for tech stocks
- c) an increase in demand for tech stocks

In other words, if we knew for sure that tech did not grow and that demand was the same, that would guarantee 25% in losses to put the market back where it would otherwise be with identical financial conditions. In math terms, if we assume A and C constant then that means losses (B) have to make up the entire amount. Keep in mind percentages as amounts change: 35% in gains got us here but only approximately 25% in losses would negate it. Sounds weird but just do the math or trust me. 

Of course, we don’t actually know those things, and I am confident there was *some* real growth in the past year. The pandemic has significantly benefited tech in the real world. Working from home means a greater demand for a variety of services like computing and communication. However, not all of the growth is permanent. Not all, but some people will return to actual stores in lieu of e-retail. Some people will go to actual theaters, and go outside and thus spend less time on Netflix or Twitter. Overall, it’s tough to project actual tech sector growth of 35% for the period of Feb - Feb. 

There was also definitely an increase in demand due to the increase in money supply. So I am certain the losses won’t be the full 25% or even close. 

I can’t predict the sequence of events so it could be all at once or it could be spread out over the next few months. 

Tldr **But either way, there will be a lot of volatility and I would expect that 3 months from now the Nasdaq is around 5% down from where it is today.**"

I’m considering buying some calls, because long term I’m fine holding the stock, because their tech fabric is so much more sophisticated than other brands and that I think they will grow mirror. 

As a consumer of the brand, I’m surprised at how the stock has been sliding (below $300 from almost $400 recently, which was more than the general tech sell off). Following that since earnings last time they’ve released several colorways and items (align tank, scuba 1/2 zip) that they can’t keep in stock in addition to lowing their payroll, because all the seasonal workers have been laid off. Additionally, people buy a lot of athletic gear in the new year with people gaining weight in covid times compounds this and more gyms opening up. People working from home have also been stocking up on athletic wear. Lululemon remains cultish where people pay 2x retail for “rare items” like recently some of the scuba 1/2 zips and align tanks, the subreddit and resellers still stalk drop times, and items sell out within a day. They still don’t put their core product on discount.

Roblox is a platform with both development tools and a social media aspect linked to it... This is not DD and is only opinion but comparing Roblox to Activision is like Comparing Tesla to Ford. The comparison makes no sense and maybe people are trying to spread this FUD to lower their own point of entry to the stock but there is a reason why ARK bought 500k shares. 

Roblox should be compared to Facebook and other social platforms first and foremost. Then take a look at user growth in a website like Codecademy ... These are more accurate comparisons. 

People and news outlets comparing Roblox to a game developer that spits out one major title every 5-10 years and hopes they can retain their online multiplayer user base are not the same thing and do not look like they ever will be.

03/13/2021,stocks,"I didn’t invest much, but I sold. It went up a lot quickly so we’ll probably get another chance to invest again."
03/13/2021,stocks,Do u think it’ll keep going up or should I sell and wait for it to go back down
03/13/2021,stocks,Secure profits...
2021-03-12 18:29:27,stocks,"I've been doing a lot of reading but I can't seem to find info on the best plan for exiting a profitable PUT position I have a couple of put options on a stock that I believe is overpriced at the moment. I didn't spend much, just a few hundred play money. The upside is significant so I want to plan an exit strategy in case of any price swings that might happen while I'm in the gym or out. 

The option's value has dropped because the stock price has gone up a bit, but what happens if the stock price drops dramatically? Do I let it auto-exercise at end of day?

I've spent hours reading up on options exit strategy but most articles discuss the difference between offsetting, exercising, or letting your option expire worthless. For maximum profitability with highly volatile stock options, what's the best plan to have in place in case of dramatic swings in the underlying stock price?"
2021-03-12 18:16:45,stocks,"Question: Is ATVI a good buy? And if so, for how long one should hold? My time horizon is about 2 years and I bought it @ 98 a few weeks ago. I am not worried about the daily ups and downs but thinking if in the long run I made a bad decision? Also I am a retail investor and have started investing at the beginning of the year. 

In terms of research on the company, I did a thorough due diligence before buying but second guessing if I made the right choice. 

Thanks"
03/13/2021,stocks,"I own ATVI with a $114 - $125 price target. Best portfolio right now (Warzone + MW3 + CoD Mobile + BOCW + WoW), highest conviction pipeline in the intermediate term (Overwatch 2 + Diablo), and best positioned U.S. publisher to capitalize on mobile. Also take a look at TTWO, which I'm more optimistic for outperformance in the long-term, but IDK if it will happen in two years.

Disclosure: I own ATVI & TTWO"
03/13/2021,stocks,"Thanks i think the same. My target price is also between 114-125. Lets see if it reaches this year. Thanks, not a financial advisor"

2021-03-12 18:04:42,stocks,Robinhood purposely delaying my deposit? So I am using robinhood and I know they are shady. So I tried to transfer 5k into my account and they say the funds want be available to buy until the 16th of March. And this wqs purchased 3 days ago. This isn't normal right? You think this is intentional? Can anyone recommend a good app to use besides these guys? Thanks.

03/13/2021,stocks,"Even if you were holding long through the COVID crash BRK has surpassed its 2019 highs. I believe this is an excellent and very safe play for the supercharged economy coming. Their subsidiaries do everything from banking, transport, insurance, clothes, fast foods (remember the DQ in the malls?), confectionery, industrial equipment and so on, and Apple. It’s like buying a piece of the us economy. Great idea for the rest of the year!"

03/13/2021,stocks,My main problem with them: both Munger and WB have about five seconds left to live. Then what? Panic sell-off.
03/13/2021,stocks,Do you really think an almost $600b company doesn’t have a plan in place for when their practically centenarian founders die?
03/13/2021,stocks,"I used to think the same thing. But now I think a temporary minor selloff may be possible, bit after studying Buffet and Munger, they really don’t micro manage... i have full faith that Ajit will follow same value principles and possibly even bring a new perspective on modern value. Buffet made a great foundation and I think he fully understands how critical choosing his successor(s) are to the continued value of brk. Not worried at all."
03/13/2021,stocks,It doesn't really matter what I think. What will everyone else think?
03/13/2021,stocks,"I’m fairly certain the big money invested in brk won’t emotionally sell off when they die, institutional investors know that Buffett and munger don’t really even call the shots anymore."
03/13/2021,stocks,Sell and rebuy if you have held it for a month (30 days?) so you can write off the loss. Then you can also average down if you wish
03/13/2021,stocks,Damn nice returns. Can't argue with that
03/13/2021,stocks,"Semiconductors is a riscy business in general and it's especially wild right now. Sure, Qualcom is looking great, but Samsungs upcoming SOCs with AMD GPUs also look pretty damn promising. So what if they absolutely stomp Qualcoms SOCs and everyone wants Samsung chips? This is a realistic scenario and Samsung has the advantage of in house production as well as huge manufacturing capacity, also they already sold to third parties in the past. What if Apple decides to sell its chips to third parties as well? What if NVIDIA makes a comeback in the ULP area or AMD starts making its own SOCs next year? I don't really know what patents Qualcom holds, but others have 5G patents too and I doubt that they can afford to (or are allowed to) stop licensing their tech because of that pressure. There is a lot that can go wrong, but it obviously doesn't have to. The market just moves extremely fast and you have to follow it as a whole, or you are at a permanent risc of riding your horse over a cliff.  I think that's a big reason people are careful when it comes to semiconductors."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Well... a few things happened. Apple has plans to build their own chips now. So that made it fall. Then they ran out of chips because they are fabless, so their guidance was bad. The stock fell. And then the past month happened and semis have gotten wrecked. 

Is it a buy right now? Yes. But I do not like semis in this current market at all. People already this year at times would rotate out of semis and Into oil or industrials before it even made sense. Even though it still doesn’t. I don’t think the pain for semis is over yet, and if it is they are going to go sideways for awhile. 

I’d buy 25 percent of a position. But don’t fall for those big green days as a sudden return.

My preference for semis right now would be Infineon or NXP for automotive and industrial. I guess ON but their margins do not compare. And semiconductor capital equipment."
03/13/2021,stocks,"I bought the day they announced acquisition of Nuvia.

They're gonna grow massively I think."
03/13/2021,stocks,No brainer to have them in your portfolio for me. Growth plus a nice dividend.
03/13/2021,stocks,130 is a steal. It may dip a little further but qcom should get up to 160-180 within the year

03/13/2021,stocks,Tsm is building in Arizona
03/13/2021,stocks,You still didn’t answer the question ‘why’ QCOM is overpriced. Where is your logic? It looks to me that you lost some money in this stock and now you’re anti QCOM lol
03/13/2021,stocks,"I've never invested in Qualcomm.  Not even before the crash of 2000.

Also I did answer the question.  It's not my fault that nobody here has ever taken a finance course and cries because I don't fellate a stock they heard about five minutes ago but know nothing about."
03/13/2021,stocks,Then how do you know it’s overpriced? You know pretty much nothing about the company
03/13/2021,stocks,"Qualcomm designs and manufactures CDMA ASICs for full duplex cellular transceivers.  I've worked in software and telecom finance/data analytics for more than twenty years... I was at Lucent/Bell Labs when they broke the 400 Gbps barrier over fiber in 1997 with DWDM ATM switches (WaveStar OLS 400G).

Their fair value by way of DCF analysis is around $60, or maybe $80 if we're being really generous with cost of capital assumptions (re: discount rate)."
03/13/2021,stocks,"I think there are some major flaws in your ‘DCF’ analysis if it gives you that fair value is $60. That’s almost 50% drop from the current price which makes QCOM only a $70B market cap, a 11 P/E ratio, under 10 FP/E?"
03/13/2021,stocks,"The fact that you put DCF in quotation marks tells me you never took a finance course in your life.

Discounted cash flow analysis is one of the key valuation methods used by M&A (mergers & acquisition) analysts at investment banking firms."
03/13/2021,stocks,"That’s not my point. Whatever valuation methods you use, $60 fair value is just absurd.  You keep avoiding my question."
03/13/2021,stocks,Do you always get suckered into paying sticker price?
03/13/2021,stocks,"Ok boomer keep up with your DCF model that would probably tell you TSLA is worth like $50, which you definitely missed lol"
03/13/2021,stocks,"I'm puzzled why you think it's smarter to pay more for the same asset rather than less.

Beyond that, I'm not moved by your appeals to emotion.  I sure as hell don't get my investment advice from Reddit... lol."

03/13/2021,stocks,Too late. Shorted Friday. Jesus take the wheel.
03/13/2021,stocks,"Not completely accurate, but basically this.

I just went through this exact thing a few months ago when Wanda Sports (Ironman) went private.  Your brokerage firm will send you snail mail notices  that they company is trying to go private.  I don't remember the exact details but they need to buy out 80% of the outstanding ownership or something close to that.  If they do that they will go private and your shares are now worthless. Your broker will not pay you out per share unless you authorize them to do so.  If you do nothing they will vanish.

In my case I tried for a few days to get a broker on the line to authorize the sale.  I never could because of timing issues.  I finally just sold them at market price for a bit less than the company offered and was fine with it.  After all, I hit a dead end trying to get a broker on the line.   If I where you I would just sell into the market if it is close to the asking price and move on.  That's how I did it."
03/13/2021,stocks,"I have April and May puts out on them right now, and I’m down. Still holding because they are trash and will drop. They are just being propped up by funds like SoftBank to push the price up as much as they can before they dump that trash! It’s BS"

I also never used it even in a pandemic (or especially in a pandemic) literally almost anyone can drive for door dash, I just don’t like the idea of randoms handling my food in the privacy of their cars"
03/13/2021,stocks,"I will still be using it after the pandemic.  It’s so much easier than getting kids in the car and getting the out to go inside and pick up food and then back to the car and blah blah.  Also we have dashpass so we can order from multiple restaurants so we don’t all have to eat chicken nuggets or whatever.  If I didn’t have kids I’m sure I wouldn’t use it as often after the pandemic, but I also know there’s a lot of people like me who have found doordash and other delivery services are well worth what they charge for families with little kids or people with health concerns or people who are just busy."
03/13/2021,stocks,Nothing like soggy warm food! Yum 🤤
03/13/2021,stocks,"People will bash it because they’ll value it as a car company with traditional value-based valuation models rather than a leader in the next autonomous taxi market with the best batteries and brand recognition in the entire space

Excuse me.. What?"
03/13/2021,stocks,"What other EVs do you see on the road that are actually competitors?

The point is, ppl are claiming Tesla is overvalued based on fundamentals but they never established what is “value”. Where is your reference? Where is the datum for comparison?
None. 

Until other EVs populate the road and we have actual valid data to compare. Tesla will remain rightfully “overvalued”

Get it? Downvote all you want. Basicass fundamentals aren’t gonna explain why Tesla will continue to dominate"
03/13/2021,stocks,"The difference between paper and real account is immense. You will learn a lot on paper, but the real experience starts when you invest your own money. In paper accounts you are detached from money, somewhat indifferent. People say not to trade with emotions, but it's just not easy and emotions are just a part of the stock market. It has an impact on psychology. 

Using small amounts seems like a good idea to start with, but you will move up to your own normal sized trades (33% of my salary is my trade size) pretty quickly once you see that you have +20% gains."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Yes.

Whenever I win big on something, I like to readjust my portfolio.  In a regular account that means short term or long term capital gains taxes.  Better to buy things you want to hold a long time in regular account.  In tax sheltered account you can buy and sell something 10 times in the same day, just for fun."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Go for it. I’m suffering now because of the recent dip but did pick up some new things. In my Roth I now have AAPL, ARKG, AMZN, BAC, DIS, JPM. Mainly AAPL. I readjust pretty much every month and just keep contributing.

03/13/2021,stocks,"You definitely don't want loose your principle if you can help it, but other than that, trade away."
03/13/2021,stocks,Put money into a good company.  Worst thing that happens is a correction and you hold stock in a good company.
03/13/2021,stocks,"No, you get to subtract your meme losees from your S&P gains, so you want your meme stocks in a regular account.  You want good companies in Roth (e.g goog, apple, amazon, brk.b etc.).  Then if they run up on speculation (ahem TSLA), you can sell without tax consequences."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Doesn't hurt anymore than regular money other than you can't write it off. If you are maxed out on Roth and 401K, it would be pretty hard to jack up your retirement.  It would take someone special."
03/13/2021,stocks,Got in this morning....thanks!
03/13/2021,stocks,Good luck!
03/13/2021,stocks,Doesn’t Rocket initially fund the mortgages and then packages and sell them as govt insured MBS to investors? They make money on the spread between short rates they borrow at and the long rates they sell the packaged mortgages at. Since the yield curve has steepen it should be a net positive for their margins. But rising long rates over time may reduce volume. In short run rising rates may actually increase volumes as people race to close deals before rates rise further. My take is that a rising 10 year yield is not necessarily a negative for their business based on above. Not sure if my take is accurate.
03/13/2021,stocks,i call bullshit. twice i been in rocket. more than my wife. and both times i took the minimum loss.

Mentions on SOME and Stock value?

Is there a correlation, and is it positive or negative?

Secondly, is Twitter and Reddit the best sources for mining mentions? What about financial news outlets? 

And how accurate is the sentiment analysis?

Really curious because I have been using big data/some software in the past. 

It was really good at finding mentions, to specific topics or brands (but It requires. A very specific search - think Google search terms) but sentiment analysis was off. It’s been some years since I looked into, so things could have changed :)"

03/13/2021,stocks,"They handled my mortgage and said they wouldn't sell it. I don't think I have that in writing but it was a point they kept harping on so they must be proud of it. I've use them for the last 3-4 years and most certainly will for my next mortgage barring some drastic difference in rates. Process was way, way easier than the company we had been using before them."
03/13/2021,stocks,Key it’s always nerve wracking wondering who’s going to be your service provider. If had good ones and bad ones
03/13/2021,stocks,Great question. Simple math. The derivatives market is a multiple of the stock market and it works like a lever because market makers have to trade the underlying to make those derivatives happen. Some estimates go to 1.2 quadrillion USD vs around 12 (?) trillion USD for the stock market. Another estimate puts the derivatives market at roughly 10x world GDP... so thats quite a big lever :)

03/13/2021,stocks,"Impending eviction crisis? I do understand it will hurt people but on the scale of economy it is really not really something like a crisis? What am I missing?

In the US, currently estimated with a few million families behind on rent. Even in the expensive state like California, the average is about 2% of household behind on rent with average amount of just $4500. That’s barely $400 million for California’s. Now scale that up at 2% of all households in entire US and say each household is behind by $20000, that will be an amount of $50 billion. 

Honestly, on scale of economy, $50 billion is practically peanuts. I mean take just Tesla for example, it gains and dropped well over $100 billion in valuation in one week. Also, 20k per household debt is nothing, average college graduates incur more debt than that. In the same time frame, US household saving rate is at record high at over 20%, that amount translates to a whopping $4000 extra saving per person. So there seems to be a lot of assets growth as comparing to debt. Of course the distribution is making economic inequality even worse.

So why is this described as a crisis? I can understand humanitarian aspect, but what’s going on there."

Why is this? The EY is now decreasing slowly. 

This is what I'm seeing when I look at this chart:

* During the March 2000 - 2002 downturn, in which the markets shed about 40% of value, the EY actually was at a very low in March 2002. But this was a very good time to get into the market, since it started rising after that.

* During the 2008 Great Recession, the EY hit a minimum around May 2009. This was also a very good time to get back into the market. 

**Why didn't the Recession of 2020 not have this signal?**

**Also, usually, the markets are a ""good deal"" when the EY is high. But in this case, we're seeing why it's good to buy when the EY is low.** Explain this paradox, please."

I have only ever traded options one other time before this and had about 10x unrealized profit at one point (ended up being greedy and losing everything).

F (Ford) $13 Call, Exp 3/19
Break even price $13.28, Avg cost $.28, current price $.57 
Total return: +$29.00 (+103.5%)

HUGE (FSD Pharma) $1.5 Call, Exp 3/19
Break even price $2.00, Avg cost $.50, current price $.60 
Total return: +$10.00 (+20%)

03/13/2021,stocks,"Hi smarties!  
I'm trying to dip my toes into options trading and was hoping to see if someone can verify I understand this. I don't know what I'm doing yet, so I'm being very cautious about it.

CTAS has their earnings report on Wed and I'm bullish about it. I think the price could go up to $380, between now and the expiration date, so I buy the $370 strike price call for $5.05 each. Let's say earnings is good and it hits $380.05 and I decide to sell those calls. I have now made $5 profit for each call I bought and sold.

Does this sound correct?"

In this case; would my stocks automatically transfer over as if it was a merger, or would I have to re-buy them? I’m slightly confused as to what happens once a merger occurs for a SPAC"

03/13/2021,stocks,"My answer to a German who asked: will $TSLA ever rise again?



Tesla isn't just a conventional automaker.  Tesla will get a position like Google, as data from autonomous driving will be collected, exploited and sold over the past and next few years.  The other automakers will not start from scratch to collect informational data here for you.

 I am sure that Tesla will be the most valuable company in the world in the next 5 years.

 Ark invest continues to buy regularly for a reason.

 If you continue to compare Tesla with BMW, VW and Co., then you have not understood Tesla.

 The robotaxi market alone is worth US $ 5 trillion!

 So Tesla will not have overproduced cars in the future either, because these will go straight to the robotaxi market.

 Bus and train (short distances) will soon be superfluous.  So Tesla will soon be displacing not only taxis and public transport, but also Uber.  So digitization is going to be digitized.

 The question shouldn't be “if” but “when” ?!

 My portfolio consists of 20% Tesla which is quite a lot.  I've been with it since 2017 and I'm still buying more.

 While most ignorantly compare Tesla with a normal automaker, the $ TSLA pulls you by cheaply.

 At Tesla you have everything: money, top management (and exceptional leadership), the crowd (almost a fan base more than Apple) and of course great products!

 If Tesla wanted to compete with other car-based manufacturers, then the Tesla vehicles would be better processed.

 But that's not what this is about.

Edit: digitalization*"

03/13/2021,stocks,"So, before I get into what strategy I would do, I'm going to recommend some educational resources for you incase you need them. So first is investor.gov, which has a great getting started section, aswell as being all round a great website for investing ""safe"", next is investopedia, which is like the Wikipedia for investing, but also as a great education section full of great articles. Finally the one I recommend the most is khan academy, which has some really spectacular videos on all things related to the stock market. Ok so now for my strategy, what I would do is split your money (not necessarily evenly) between three different stocks/ETFs, so the first one would be your stable stock/ETF, (example VOO)where you just set it and forget it. Next is your dividend one, where it should be sort of stable but with high dividends (example VYM), and now with your new found dividends I'd reinvest back into your stable and the following. The following is what usually is a individual stock, but could be an etf. So the following would be something that you really believe in, something that you think is undervalued and will grow. This doesn't necessarily have to be 100% safe, as you have your stable stock and to a extent your dividend stock to rely on. So an example would be Sony, which is a company I feel really passionate about on which I  made a DD that I can share with you if you would like. So , in summary, my strategy would be a very low risk etf, low risk dividend stock/etf and sort of risky stock/etf which you believe will grow faster than your stable and the market in general. Sorry for this wall of text, hopefully it helps and my inbox is open to any questions. DISCLAIMER: This is a copy and paste due to loads of people asking similar questions, Sony and all stock/ETFs listed are just examples which can be rotated out and this is in no way financial advise"

03/13/2021,stocks,"Technical analysis to establish a good entry point / point at which you significantly increase your position is likely to give you most confidence of getting in at a fair price.

However, it also depends how much you believe in a company, and how much you’re in for a long hold. Starting a position - even with a share or two - if you think it’s near a reasonable price can sometimes be waiting for a level that never comes, if your investment philosophy isn’t strict value investing."

03/13/2021,stocks,"In my opinion this is partially a reaction to some of the non-healthcare related decisions Pfizer is making for itself and the bad look it creates, and partially a symptom of Pfizer's status as a - for lack of a better term - preexisting powerhouse.  

They increased their CEO's salary by ~25% the year of a pandemic - bad optics. Their vaccine is one of the shakier ones out there, especially for the newer strains - bad optics. Apparently their own investment portfolios have been hit and miss throughout this time - bad optics, considering literally all you had to do was buy low/sell high for this one to work (Ray Charles could have seen this one coming and yet still somehow I did not).  

So now that you see the bad look, you gotta realize that Pfizer was an established corporation. Even if it did grow, the room for growth in terms of ratio and not absolute growth simply wasn't there like it was for these newer companies.  

In short: Pfizer kept doing all the normal corporate things in a time where normal corporate things weren't exactly rewarded handsomely 100% of the time."

From what i see, the big issue is how its expecting negative growth this year and the next.


Now the question you might ask is: ""how the hell do they not expect to grow???"". Well that question is very valid. One reason i can see is how they offer 5% yield, so seems like profits go to dividends more than growth."

Baba will overcome this setback, but we have no clue when. It could be in a year, it could take multiple years for the Chinese government to finally back off. Until then, major investment firms are reducing their positions and staying away, meaning the stock will underperform. I had been reducing my overweight Baba position for the past month, and finally sold out during one of the morning rallies a few weeks back, so that I could rotate that money into other blue chippers that were on fire sale (MSFT, ETSY, TGT). Sad to see what China has done to this global leader in ecommerce. Baba will be back, but it's going to take a while, and in the meantime you can find better growth opportunities elsewhere."

03/13/2021,stocks,"All of Chinese tech is on sale right now because of the regulatory headwinds these companies face from their own government. Be wary that when you buy these stocks, you're at the mercy of the communist Chinese government, which has free reign to come in and dice up companies as they please. I got sick of this uncertainty myself, and recently sold all my Baba and Tencent.

That said, I do think JD faces the least amount of regulatory headwinds here. The company already went through the pain of angering China some years ago — dipped and recovered in stock price — and is now unfairly dragged down with other tech stocks, which are just now dealing with the CCP. JD in the low $80s is a bargain. If I had any dry powder left after this recent correction — or if I can create some cash somewhere in my portfolio — I'd absolutely look to buy JD here."

03/13/2021,stocks,These never have big dips even when market crashes they only lose 30%
03/13/2021,stocks,I'm interested in seeing that if you don't mind.
03/13/2021,stocks,Hyperinflation isn't going to happen.
03/13/2021,stocks,"He's being sarcastic about all the dummies who bought into the recovery stocks over tech stocks for more than a few weeks. Nasdaq are just even more the stocks to own, now."
03/13/2021,stocks,That sounds good. I fucked up big time recently when I sold all my long term stocks. Sigh. Will never see my cost basis again unless there is crash 😭
03/13/2021,stocks,"This was my plan from the beginning. Hold my long term tech heavy stuff knowing its going to rotate back and average down. So far its paid off huge this week. 

I have a little value by holding VTV but thats it. Like you said i cant seem to find a good value/ reopening stock that doesnt seem extremely over priced. Eventually everyone's gonna dump value for tech. Maybe in a few months or a year but i believe tech is the 3-5 year hold/ move."
03/13/2021,stocks,"There are at least 1 or 2 in consumer financials not overbought. WMT has a little room to run still. And utilities. WMT, COF, AEP, a couple other specialty commercial banks but they are pricey."
03/13/2021,stocks,Any reason in particular? I’ve only made money from Ford and hold some shares
03/13/2021,stocks,it expires at the end of the week
03/13/2021,stocks,"But will they behave similarly? For example, can one of them moon and the other be left behind (I'd assume the NYSE one to be more popular)?"
03/13/2021,stocks,Confused or maybe he edited? 370 call and stock in the hypo hits 380.05. Paid 5.05. How is he/she not up 5 plus a little premium?
03/13/2021,stocks,You'll want to get in a bit before next NFL season.
03/13/2021,stocks,He gonna paper hand the whole thing
03/13/2021,stocks,I would def not chose just these but a small position in them on the side isn't a terrible idea.
03/13/2021,stocks,"I will keep holding it...I don't know why, but will keep holding it :("
03/13/2021,stocks,"So frustrating as all other COVID-19 stocks went through the roof.  I have been holding PFE for years, but will never understand.  It seems like the worst performing (other than it just stays the same, so not loosing but not gaining too much either).  Thank you."
03/13/2021,stocks,People loved Baba here swore it was the Amazon of China. Ever since the Jack Ma/Chinese delisting it has done pretty poorly
03/13/2021,stocks,Thanks! I think I'll jump on that bandwagon :)
03/13/2021,stocks,Thank you very much for the clarification
03/13/2021,stocks,"I think they will be relevant, but they won't grow as much as you'd expect in 10years, therefore they're not worth holding IMO for 10 years when you could make more money in other ways. I would rather keep buying low and selling high, and swinging them. It's my personal preference. 

What a poor take on your part for thinking the market still operates the same way. Good luck to you bro"
03/13/2021,stocks,"Yep that’s what I’m leaning towards. However..

VIOI is looking hot. Like that dude in the meme who does a double take at the girl"
03/13/2021,stocks,What ya mean? Looks like it doubled in price? Does chart not reflect current stats? Like shouldn’t a full recovery get it back to around 45-60 dollars a share?
03/13/2021,stocks,"EV and EV related stocks are horrible overpriced and I thinks it’s too late and too overpriced to get in now. 

Take NIO for example. Nio has a market cap of 77 BILLION. That’s bigger than companies like Honda and Ford.  

Nio made a grand total of... 43 thousand vehicles last year."
03/13/2021,stocks,Yeah IIRC Pfizer and Moderna both dipped hard and didn’t quite recover after they were approved. Just sold the last of my Moderna the other day
03/13/2021,stocks,I am a bot
03/13/2021,stocks,That’s the future baby... 🚀
03/13/2021,stocks,Worldwide (cathy wood‘s analysis) you can read it on Ark-invest
03/13/2021,stocks,"People those days read ""Amazon of country X"" and just put the money in."
03/13/2021,stocks,I think 10 maybe. I was under 10 and tried to post twice and was bumped away.
03/13/2021,stocks,Funny I just started doing the same thing. Apples are very low right now. Each red day lower and lower.
03/13/2021,stocks,damn that must feel bad
03/13/2021,stocks,Pmed you it!
03/13/2021,stocks,"Yeah and I'm sure people said that during those times too. These kind of bubbles always have the same people who say, well, this time is different."
03/13/2021,stocks,Well you just gotta buy back lower than what you sold for and you're good
03/13/2021,stocks,Ford will continue to grow for sure that’s all I can say
03/13/2021,stocks,"Okay, forgive me for using the meme stock but it’s the best one to show “mooning” with. 
https://imgur.com/a/BrpGdOH/

Added a screenshot of the Frankfurt and the New York stock exchanges. 

Here you can see it’s that while the ticket and exchange can be different, it’s still the same stock."
03/13/2021,stocks,I cannot read.
03/13/2021,stocks,Yep. This is my plan. Slowly DFAing up to 10 shares.
03/13/2021,stocks,"Yep. I have main investments in indices and then $1k in ARKF on the side. So far, it’s not been good for me, but it will be in the long run. FinTech is not going away. MSOS not bad either."
03/13/2021,stocks,"It’s not like the company is going away - and if they maintain this level of dividend payment and don’t tank then you at least have a nice long term hold for the compound. Just look at their long term. They’re up literally on the week, month, year, and long, so there’s no real reason to drop them. Shit, I might buy some PFE next week to be honest with you. I’m not saying go all in, but like, what do you see in the stock that is bad long term? I see nothing."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Tbh i feel like my answer is incomplete, does not make a lot of sense for them to have so little expected growth. Hopefully someone else understands it lol"
03/13/2021,stocks,"We must have a disconnect, because in your past post you said you don’t see long stocks being a thing anymore and then go on to say they will be in fact relevant. Explaining to me that you buy low and sell high isn’t pertinent, and you know full well that’s not what I was criticizing."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Nio has been ramping up every month. 

That said, NIO is still likely overvalued. But I don't think it'll get corrected until after it hits 60 again. So still a superb buy right now."
03/13/2021,stocks,Ford has been doing well lately. I'm looking for a pullback to up my position. Is the talk still of Biden picking an American EV for fleet because I feel like Ford is a couple sides of that die.
03/13/2021,stocks,Good bot.
03/13/2021,stocks,"For whatever reason, I was under the impression you were just talking about America."
03/13/2021,stocks,"The government invested in a scam remember?

03/13/2021,stocks,Hmm. My first comment got 25 upvotes so I should have at least 10 karma by now right? I still can't post
03/13/2021,stocks,Much appreciated!
03/13/2021,stocks,"Now let's apply that logic to the same people who have been preaching this doomer shit for the last few decades and have been consistently wrong every time.

Until you can prove hyperinflation is going to happen we can safely assume it won't and things will continue as they have before."
03/13/2021,stocks,LOL no worries. I was hoping this was my excuse for losing money on options...
03/13/2021,stocks,fuck
03/13/2021,stocks,Buy more!
03/13/2021,stocks,"John,

We can sit here and agree to disagree if it bothers you so much. What I say now is what I plan to do. You don't have to be a part of it or participate in any way.  I'm sharing what I want to share, history changes buddy."
03/13/2021,stocks,"How to you know the regulation just begins? Why China wants to delay its own growth when it desperately look for a rebound in the economy? And if the market is smart, why BABA rose 3% yesterday when WSJ reported there would be a $975M fine?"
03/13/2021,stocks,She has a reason to be scared then. They’re amazing and I wouldn’t doubt if she ended up with one very soon. You can get 20 for the price of one clunky machine.
03/13/2021,stocks,Maybe because i said $... next time i will mention all currencies
03/13/2021,stocks,"ohhh! you mean start a thread? yeah, that must be high count. i couldn't even respond to posts for a while on some boards. that's what i was talking about. ah well. here's another upvote. :-)"
03/13/2021,stocks,"No problem, feel free to share any thoughts/criticism/questions you may have on Sony and the DD"
03/13/2021,stocks,"Eh, regardless, we are going to see the consequences of printing this much money, at some point."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Thanks for helping me remove misinformation.

Just buy options on anything. Stonks only go up."
03/13/2021,stocks,Buy the dip 😋
03/13/2021,stocks,Remind me! 10 Years
03/13/2021,stocks,"Have you done any actual research into this? Or do you just own Baba and feel angry about it’s underperformance?

The Chinese economy is recovering the fastest on the planet. The reason China is regulating Baba, Baidu, and Tencent has nothing to do with the economy. China does not like how powerful these companies have become. Baba, especially.

Baba rose 3% yesterday because literally all big tech rose yesterday. Even underperforming stocks like Baba.

Listen, I was a Baba bull for many years. And I still think the stock can reach $400 in the years ahead. But for now, if you own Baba, you’re at the full mercy of the Chinese regulators. And in their government, they can do whatever the hell they want to a company. That kind of uncertainty is why foreign investment firms are dumping Baba left and right. It sucks, but it’s the truth. And you can fight against that all you want. Best of luck. I rotated out of Baba into companies with a clearer picture ahead."
03/13/2021,stocks,Ohhh ok lol. The weird thing is that I see a ton of posts in new from people who have little or no stock knowledge so I wonder how they got the karma
03/13/2021,stocks,Can't seem to find it in pms I'm afraid.
03/13/2021,stocks,"You say we print a lot, but remember we lost a lot too. Gdp fell 4 percent in 2020. If the GDP bounces back then it won't have consequences."
03/13/2021,stocks,Only when I sell covered calls on a stock that I can't afford the get snatched due to tax issues! LOL. Those are fun. That's how you can lose a trade twice...
03/13/2021,stocks,Well damn! I bought in at $20!! Me and my FOMO!!

03/13/2021,stocks,"Let's do this to make it more fun, tell me 3 blue-chips you're holding onto for say (6 months) but intend on holding for much longer obviously. I will begin swinging on Monday, let's see who makes the most in a more realistic approach (6 months out, 9 months out, 12 months out) so we could actually catch up and reflect within a reasonable amount of time. This is fair?"
03/13/2021,stocks,"Lmao so now you admit it’s more about the overall market performance. 

Just look at tencent graph in its HK listing. Compare the time stamp of the following three incidents: when it price went down, when the regulation news went out, when the US 10Y rate went up."
03/13/2021,stocks,there's ALOT of pump-n-dump posters and i think groups of people who all bought the same stock to pump-n-dump help each other get attention (by commenting in agreement to their pals' posts) and upvotes.
03/13/2021,stocks,"Sony (SNE) DD. First, their image and sensing division. Currently, Sony has a staggering 53.5% share of the image sensor market with Samsung being in second with only 18.1%. Why do image sensors matter so much, well, image sensors are key for cameras, medical imaging equipment, security and surveillance, ai and robotics, barcode readers, phones (your phone will have Sony parts unless it's a Samsung) and most lucrative of them all, autonomous vehicles.This currently brings in 26% of Sony's revenue, at a 13.5% margin.                                
 
Next is Sony music, the biggest music publisher in the world. They have some of the biggest names in the industry, with artists like Ed Sheeran, 21 savage, childish gambino, DJ Khalid and more. And as music streaming grows (with Spotify reporting 29% year over year growth, and tencent music  70%), Sony will be in a great position to dish out music from its signed artists. Music makes up 16% of Sony's revenue at a margin of 20%.( I will talk more about ""other "" at the end of the DD, but just so you know, other is grouped into music).                                  

Next is playstation. Sony has managed to do something quite brilliant with playstation, they have managed a transition from physical games to digital games, why does that matter, well, digital games gives sony higher margins. But the most exciting aspect of playstation is ps plus, ps plus has went from only 4m subscribers back 6-7 years ago, to having 48m subscribers, more than HBO max, and actually, ps plus now has a bigger operating profit than Netflix, whilst Netflix had 2x the market cap of the entire Sony business. And that number of ps plus subscribers is only set to grow, with gaming being the fastest growing aspect of entertainment. It is also likely that we will give our children PlayStation's, who will in turn give their kids kids PlayStation, like how whole families come together to watch the Simpsons. You may be thinking of their competitor, Xbox, but Xbox has only really solidified in North America and western Europe, with Sony significantly beating them Asian market. Revenue 26%, operating margin 13%.                                           

Next is Sony pictures, a company you may be familiar with, they have made everything from the smurfs, Spiderman and the shark tank. You may know of the ongoing streaming war, and one of my favourite quotes is don't make wars, provide ammo, which is exactly what Sony is doing. You may not know but Netflix don't actually produce their exclusives, they out source it, and one of the studios they outsource it to is Sony, Sony has made quite a hit for Netflix, The crown, with a reported 73 million households watching it. But Sony pictures doesn't just do work for Netflix, they also have done Alex Rider, a prime exclusive and Greyhound, an apple TV exclusive. Sony pictures brought in 8% of revenue at a 9.6% margin.           

Next is Sony electronics, who make things from headphones, televisions and their world renowned camera's, there are countless videos on YouTube, of people positively speaking of their switch of Nixon to Sony, showing a high brand loyalty in the photography market. 10% of revenue at a 6.6% margin. 

Next is financial services, I can't comment too much on them, as I didn't research them thoroughly, but I can say that their revenue is  10% at a 10.6% margin. 

Now I will discuss other. So first up is Sony's quiet move into monopolising anime, the second fastest growing aspect of entertainment, they have acquired crunchy roll, funimaton, aniplex and more. This means that if will be very hard for other streaming services to compete with Sony's anime, like how it was hard to compete with Netflix. A another quote from my favourite business book is be best or be first, and Sony are doing both in the anime market.                                                                               
 
Next is Sony's car, I feel it's a marketing stunt to show off and advertise their parts to other automakers, but it really shows what Sony is capable of, with Sony audio in the car, sony image sensors, Sony infotainment and more. 

Lastly is their mobile game, I again can't comment too much on it but it is very popular in Asia and brings in 1 billon in revenue, any questions feel free to ask. It's a kind of simple DD but I can elaborate on certain sectors you are interested in

Not very specific on each sector so if your interested or have any questions on a certain bit of song feel free to ask"
03/13/2021,stocks,"Huh that's weird, I'll attach it on a reply to you then"
03/13/2021,stocks,"Oh shit Elon just tweeted a picture of your stock with a cheetah next to it, it’s now at $300"
03/13/2021,stocks,Diamond hands!!!
03/13/2021,stocks,"What? Are you reading what I’m writing? I said the reason Baba’s decline took a break yesterday was because the entire market went up. The reason Baba is on a broader decline is because of the massive regulatory headwinds the company faces. 

Do yourself a favor and Google “China regulations tech companies.” If you want to invest in companies getting hampered and restructured by the Chinese government, with no end in sight, be my guest. You must enjoy losing money."
03/13/2021,stocks,Ahhh ok
03/13/2021,stocks,"Got it now, thanks"
03/13/2021,stocks,Now I must go to counseling to deal with my PTSD and delusions of grandeur.
03/13/2021,stocks,"You are the one who need to read. I never deny Baba is CCP’s target now. Instead, I’m explaining the real reason why **most** Chinese tech went down today.

Your thesis on all the rest of Chinese tech giants facing regulation is nothing but speculation at this time. So some news you read makes you believe that. That’s how retail investors got manipulated by the media. 

Source: I’m a Chinese knowing CCP well, and no position in BABA. I don’t need to Google to make me an expert on Chinese stocks"
03/13/2021,stocks,"Just to be clear: You’re now telling me that I’m being manipulated by the news reported by every media outlet on the planet, explaining how the CCP is regulating its largest tech companies? Ummmm, ok. Just believe whatever the CCP tells you, my friend. I’ll go by what I see on the stock charts, especially the MACD lines of all these stocks, which shows the broad extent of the selloff of Chinese tech. I’ll believe the public evidence filed by major foreign investment firms that shows them dumping Chinese tech as quickly as they can. I’ll continue making money and you’ll continue falling in line for the CCP. This all makes a lot of sense now.

I’m seriously not trying to be an asshole. I love all these companies. They’ve made me a lot of money. They’re world-class. But right now, their growth is being limited by the Chinese government. And that’s the unfortunate truth."
03/13/2021,stocks,"It's too hard to time it.. I went into both around a year ago and Disney is already up huge. While AMD is back to the same price I got a year ago.. With that said yes Disney has run up already. But who knows much much more it can run. I though AMD at one point would run up to 120/130 but it never did. My suggestion is can't go wrong with either, just get the one u like more or why not even both for some diversification."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Interesting. Sounds to me that now would be a good entry point for AMD given the share price, where conversely DIS has had a sustained uptrend making it less attractive at today’s prices"
03/13/2021,stocks,I agree that unless something wild happens like delaying parks opening that it wont dip again
03/13/2021,stocks,"Given the current price point of AMD, I think you’re on the money and that AMD will eventually catch up, and once they do we will miss the current prices we are seeing now. 

DIS on the other hand has quite the ride up, and I would wait for a considerable consolidation before buying"
03/13/2021,stocks,"$GME

So theirs 60k ITM call options with expiration next Friday

6M shares need to be delivered by then

DTCC new rule means that many of failure to delivers reaches 21 days next Friday 19

i don't know man the big money behind $800 calls seems to know something"
03/13/2021,stocks,The gambling hotline just tops the entire sub off though
03/13/2021,stocks,"Re: GME. I know, this is a casino, no one can predict what will happen, trying to make sense of this world is to rage in futility against the inky void, BUT...what happens next?

Meaning, I'm assuming there will be another huge spike, then another huge crash. I'm just wondering if anyone has a gut feeling where it settles back down to? And then does the cycle repeat AGAIN?"
03/13/2021,stocks,Buying and holding is all I’m doing 🤷🏼‍♂️
03/13/2021,stocks,"Does anyone find it a little crazy that TM's P/B ratio is 1.12? Book value per share is 123$. Meaning if the company literally dies tomorrow, our shares are still worth 123$.

I have a beginner question about this: is Toyota probably the safest EV company to invest in? If EV is a bubble that may burst in the future, TM offers very little downside in my opinion. Thoughts?"
03/13/2021,stocks,"I am a complete beginner at options trading and could use some advice on wether to take profit on these call options yet. I have only ever traded options one other time before this and had about 10x unrealized profit at one point (ended up being greedy and losing everything). Due to the market dipping recently I decided to buy the following call options, which are currently all at a profit:

F (Ford) $13 Call, Exp 3/19
Break even price $13.28, Avg cost $.28, current price $.57 
Total return: +$29.00 (+103.5%)

HUGE (FSD Pharma) $1.5 Call, Exp 3/19
Break even price $2.00, Avg cost $.50, current price $.60 
Total return: +$10.00 (+20%)
Earnings will be available 3/18, do I ride this past earnings release or sell right before?

AGEN (Agenus) $2 Call, Exp 3/19
Break even price $3.30, Avg cost $1.30, current price $1.88 
Total return: +$58.00 (+44.62%)
Earnings will be available 3/15, do I ride this past earnings release or sell right before?

SENS (Senseonics) $3 Call, Exp 3/19
Break even price $3.35, Avg cost $0.35, current price $0.38 
Total return: +$3.00 (+8.57%)

I have had all of these options open for 2 days and need advice on wether I should sell now or leave some to potentially grow more. Part of me wants to leave all the money in as a gamble, but I’d also be happy with just closing for profit and reinvesting in new opportunities. I understand I am asking strangers for advice it does not mean anyone is responsible for my actions."
03/13/2021,stocks,What are some good cal options for next week?
03/13/2021,stocks,"Don’t know if anyone mentioned this yet, but daylight savings is this weekend practice Sunday, ready Monday open."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Quick question

If me and my buddies short a 50$ stock in at goes to 300$ during a short squeeze and falls down to 100 and eventually 40. If I hodl my position until the 40 - I'm in the green right? No exp date on shorts unless they are called in by brokerage or the company"
03/13/2021,stocks,Jumia is the stock to buy.  Going to be 10x within the next 18 months
03/13/2021,stocks,Stimmy time
03/13/2021,stocks,Probably going to $89
03/13/2021,stocks,Yes. That people will buy them. Check WSB - guy lost 90k on $800 calls.
03/13/2021,stocks,This is what I’m wondering too
03/13/2021,stocks,"Waaaaaaaay overvalued. But then again, so is TSLA and GME so fuck it"
03/13/2021,stocks,"This time it appears to be a little more controlled, GME has been consolidating all week in the 200 range, in comparison to the last ran up when it spiked up and down within a few days. 

There is more fuel to the fire this time. I have a feeling this is the last cycle with the earnings report and Cohen being named as ceo within the coming weeks"
03/13/2021,stocks,I spent $1000 on various puts in November and end of year. I don’t know when but it won’t sustain for months. I don’t disparage people going long on it still. I made money on previous runs. Just think it’s losing steam.
03/13/2021,stocks,"I can see this running up one more time. If only because the shorts want to push it down just for the fact of doing it. But that will be the time a dividend gets thrown as a curveball. It's just the one thing needed to snub them one last time.

As far as settling, it will depend on ER. 

A good one, and itll be held around 60, which is overvalued. And results in high shorting.

If it's a bit better than expected, I think itll be around 45 again in April. Which will result in higher shorting.

But this will be a bit longer of a settle stage. The hedge funds will run at it one last time, probably May. Not to kill it, but to knock retail down. After that run up, if gamestop has a good quarter, it wont be shorted as hard. This will last til July. Afterwards, itll be left alone and will resume a more normal level of shorting. Probably a x3 squeeze, vice the x6-8 now and x12 from january."
03/13/2021,stocks,I kind of guessed this was driven my MM and gamma squeeze and it will just slowly drift back down. Prediction $140 EOW. Maybe earnings will drive another spike but not sure.
03/13/2021,stocks,"I've been thinking about investing in TM myself (if I had the $$ now). That's a solid company with a great work culture as far as I know, and everyone I knew who had a Toyota car (including my family, and including Toyota's hybrid cars) has always been very happy with it. Toyota is one of the first companies that did hybrid cars mass production. I'm reasonably sure that hybrid cars are going to stay a bit longer than gasoline cars (proposed legislation now is saying 5 years longer), because they offer protection in cases/places with extreme conditions (think long stretches of the desert without charging stations (Australia), extreme cold that might not work out for EV, etc.) while at the same time being eco-friendly.

I didn't do any DD into that company yet though, and a great company doesn't always translate into a great stock, so please use your own judgement."

03/13/2021,stocks,I’d agree with this. I think stimulus/quad witching/ earnings sees people ride the bandwagon once more next week into the week after. After that I believe it’s dead. My price targets are a tad higher though.

Yeah, I was emotionally invested."

03/13/2021,stocks,"The catalyst this run has consistently been large investor(s) buying up the price in an effort to hunt the shorts.

I agree, it's not a short squeeze, but call options being covered. A hedge fund or collection of hedge funds have realized, with the help of a new retail frenzy, they can manipulate the price upward to trigger gamma hedging.

So the catalyst will always be a question of whether or not the big longs want to continue hunting the shorts."

The fact that is tanked so hard on Wednesday moments from hitting $350 yet bounced back rapidly on such low volume says something to me, so I threw more into it today."
03/13/2021,stocks,"That’s what I think. If there weren’t enough buyers to move it up while on the SSR I don’t see the catalyst for moving up when it’s off SSR. Unless an institution decides to move it up. WSB and their stimulus checks won’t be enough imo. It’s great if they all hold, but it’s going to take a lot more buying to make a big move up."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Well I would peel off 10 at $350 how can you lose? I see $800 or $1,000 as bizarrely optimistic. I think the hedges are much better at this game than WSB thinks."

Not so sure I feel I feel that way. The other day I saw a pic posted on r/WSB of an obviously downtrodden individual comforting a sick (maybe dying?) family member with the caption ""I hold on to GME because it's all I have left to hold on to."" This person imo probably can't afford to YOLO money into a meme stock. A lot of the folks over there are under some delusion that they're sticking it to HFs while HFs are the ones truly making a killing off the GME play. I turned a pretty good profit trading on the AMC and GME frenzies but I played with money I could afford to lose and got out with over 100% gains on each, hell nearly 400% on AMC I was pennies away from the recent $20 spike. I just don't want to see people get hurt."
03/13/2021,stocks,I was sleeping when it shot up to $350 and didn’t set a sell limit haha. And I agree they are much better and I will not be surprised with the volatility. With the new DTCC ruling that’s supposed to go into effect and other catalysts we will see.
03/13/2021,stocks,"“Bizarrely optimistic” is a fairly nice way of saying “delusional” or “uninformed”. Got nothing against anyone in for the ride, but the amount of cats over there who unironically believe it’s going to $10k or higher and invested money they can’t afford to lose, or worse, took out loans to buy in at $300, is sad when you consider the original crowd over there are guys who have the capital to burn and lose without much pain for the most part. Hope for their sake it goes over $300 again and they have the presence of mind to sell and enjoy a tiny margin AND enjoy the ride without agony that is certain for many of them. This is a company which has lost billions in revenue yoy since 18 and about to announce another major loss."

03/13/2021,stocks,"Oh 100% agree. My theory is an institution or institutions were steadily accumulating shares and then manipulated WSB to drive the price higher. Eg. The $800 calls.

03/13/2021,stocks,"That makes me sad, I’ll cry myself to sleep"
03/13/2021,stocks,"I mean, if these $800 calls are a real aspiration for someone gaming this trade then GME $1K would be a likely reality or the calls wouldn't be worth the investment."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Agreed, otherwise I like to think I’ve spent my money on dumber shit"
03/13/2021,stocks,"Oh I agree. However I will be called a boomer for this, but I also believe that somewhere down the line fundamentals have to come into play. Everything on that sub is “hodl til $10k” and even though that is a ridiculous fantasy number, and if people want to go long on that and see any ROI it’s not sustainable without some basic fundamentals. If you’re looking for some whip saw crazy ride times, it can’t be beat in the short term. Problem is most of those over there have been convinced that these numbers are real and if they hodl long enough, they will get a Lamborghini. Many believe this without hint of irony. Which in the long term will leave a lot of $200+ bag holders who could’ve dumped on the way down and recouped some of their losses. I hope I’m wrong but to me it’s not inconceivable it could be sitting sub $50 by early summer."
03/13/2021,stocks,My theory is that the only purpose of the calls was to generate hype in WSB causing them to run the stock higher.

03/13/2021,stocks,"Let me break this down a little because I understand what you are saying but there is more to the story then meets the eye. I'll try to explain it as easy as possible and add some links so you can verify what I say.

1. Overal the average US inflation has been declining since the 1980's. In the last 15 years there have been 2 problematic moments concerning inflation excluding the current pandamic. The first was the financial crisis of 2008 and the last one was at the end of 2015/beginning 2016 when the oil prices pretty much went in to a free fall in a rather short time. Inflation both times almost hit 0 or negative.

&#x200B;

2) I'm going to focus a little bit specific on what happened in 2015/2016. In this perdiod the FED increased policy rates in order the counter the negative effect crude oil prices had on US inflation. Inflation in this period was just above 0% while overal target is near 2%. So the FED has been increasing it's rates from this period up to the end of 2018 where inflation peaked over 2% target and the FED decided to lower interest rates  in 2019 as the inflation was getting too high (above 2%). So in 2019 you see some decrease in rates and in inflation. However the market was still recuperating and interest rates where not at the wanted FED lvl's so you can say these levels are a bad indicator for a healthy economy, at least for comparission.

[https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/interest-rate](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/interest-rate)

3) Bond yields: As people generally look only at the 10 year term I will use this one for my example. Since the 1980's the 10-year bond yield has been declining gradually. From  15% in the 80's to around 2%-3.5% in the last decade. So the 10year bond yield is not that exciting atm. It is around the same level it was during the last crisis (2015/2016). If you look in 2018 the yield was over 3% but artificially created due to the increased interest rates of the FED. So unless yields are hitting the 3% without the FED increasing interest rates there is nothing to worry about and seems perfectly normal compared to what we have seen before.

03/13/2021,stocks,"Regarding 2, I think you have that backwards. The fed raises rates to lower inflation, not raise it."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Yeah I should have added the following as well but it makes it a bit more complex - The increase of interest rates makes it foreign investors more attractive to invest in the US. In this case EU money because at the same time the ECB did not change interest rates like the US and Canada did. Because of the slightly stronger Euro at the same time the FED tried to balance between attracting foreign investors and decent exchange rates of the USD  hoping not to ruin imports (US is a heavy importer of goods and consumption is a major component of their GDP). By pulling in this money they where increasing inflation but at the same time managing how fast it was rising. By not increasing the rates too fast they try to cooldown the inflation rate itself so it would not sky-rocket within months.

That's what they are EXPECTING you to do. Or you can say yea na your company actually didn't just gain $15B in value in the last hour sorry.

I don't know how much more clear the pump and dump can be.

If this company had IPO'd back in December as scheduled at $45 I would have called it a great opportunity - now I think it's a scam. I 100% believe it will dip down to the 40s and maybe settle in the low 50s for a few months. Just think, is this company worth more than Activision-Blizzard??? HELLLLL NO. Not yet at least.

03/13/2021,stocks,"If you want to compare it to gaming companies (which is a bad comparison imo, it’s more of a social media platform for kids) then let’s look at 

Activision vs Roblox 

Activision Revenue: 6 Billion
Roblox Revenue: 1B

Activision, Total Monthly Players: 400 million 
Roblox, Total Monthly Players: 200 million

Activision Market Cap: 70 Billion
Roblox Market Cap: 38 Billion


So, judging by total monthly players, Roblox is perfectly valued(or just slightly overvalued). Judging by Revenue then it’s highly overvalued. I personally believe Revenue is a flawed metric and there are a thousand different ways Roblox can monetize their demographically valuable user base. They just need a large enough user base to take those measures which is where I think they are heading. Their user base is exploding and 200 million users is a shit ton that just keeps growing."

03/13/2021,stocks,Agreed. My kid moved over to recroom and he makes little worlds in VR. These type of games are creative games and they are bound to want to create! I'm happy at my 3 stocks on RBLX and likely will buy a few more.

That is exactly what the Roblox platform is so great at doing, finding _the next_ thing. It's been doing it over and over again for more than 10 years now. 

A lot of people in the indie game dev community literally go and look at what's up and coming on Roblox for ideas, because the content churn is so good at finding it."

03/13/2021,stocks,Wc3 is dead because blizzard killed it. Also the game still had a price of 30-40 dollars despite being 20 year old and the game engine was limited but people pushed it to the edge all the time.

03/13/2021,stocks,"Not going to feign super knowledge here as my comment was mostly in response to the anectodal evidence the redditor I was replying to posted.

Having said that, I think that Roblox has something really cool going on but there is no evidence yet that it can sustain such growth when compared to history competitors in the same market. Take second life for example. There was a time where it was huge and many people played it yet it's died down over the years. It also had internal marketplaces, worlds, and games people could build for each other. Then there is the more obvious comparison, Minecraft. And, yes, I understand ""Roblox is different."" But so was Minecraft when it first came out. So was Second Life. Etc. It's not to say Roblox won't be the revolutionary giant people think it will become but with current information and valuation it's more of a gamble imo."

Counterpoint would be pokemon. Investing in nintendo when pokemon red and blue came out would have been a good play, but they were already an established company by then so also an apples to oranges comparison"

03/13/2021,stocks,"It’s not that I think Roblox is a bad company it’s just priced very high right now. It definitely has growth potential but seems to prematurely grown valuation wise.

And never heard of 2nd life? Exactly lol. It was super popular amongst adults around 2010, but people don’t talk about it much anymore. I was in hs at the time and I remember my friends’ parents pouring tons of money into that game.

Also wiki re: user growth—

Second Life is an online virtual world, developed and owned by the San Francisco-based firm Linden Lab and launched on June 23, 2003. It saw rapid growth for some years and in 2013 it had approximately one million regular users;[1] growth stabilized and by the end of 2017 active user count had declined to ""between 800,000 and 900,000"".[2] In many ways, Second Life is similar to massively multiplayer online role-playing games; nevertheless, Linden Lab is emphatic that their creation is not a game: ""There is no manufactured conflict, no set objective"".[3]"

From my perspective they have a *shit ton* of free cashflow to properly invest in literally any innovative idea, with already being incredibly diversified (computers, phones/smart devices, wearable tech, health, AR/VR, rumored car, etc...) I wouldn't  be surprised if the next 2 decades prove to be the most successful for Apple if leadership continues on the right path. Tim Cook has said his legacy will be healthcare tech, which can be revolutionary.

 TSLA is WAYYY overvalued compared to Apple, with essentially non of the free cash flow, and its potential earnings in the future is already priced in, no? But I'm also not even pretending to understand this market where overvalue stocks that have close to no revenue are in the triple digits."

03/13/2021,stocks,"I don’t think the frenzy going on in the housing market is a bubble. Bubbles are driven by speculative mania. The prices we’re seeing are being driven by actual demand. Real demand. What’s causing the demand?

1) There is a mass exodus going on from more densely populated urban areas to less dense “suburban“ areas. And think about it… that 1 acre lot in Manhattan that has 200 apartments on it, in NJ only has a couple or three houses on it. So the move from more dense to less dense has a multiplier effect on the less dense area that’s difficult for it to absorb when something like this is happening.

2) There’s a flight into hard assets because of all the governmental money printing that’s been occurring recently. People aren’t hesitating for a moment when they compare a chunk of their cash sitting in deflating (fiat) currency versus having it tied up in a piece of real estate for the next 5, 10, or more years. 

3) Borrowing money is cheap right now. The low interest rate environment that we’re in only fuels number one and two above even further.

Prices will eventually settle down, in who knows how long, but I don’t believe there’s a “bubble” that’s going to pop."

That seems irrational to me, the problem with the low rates causing people to borrow means houses are inaccessible without debt and the longer this goes on the more you price out young people and imagrants, ypu know the people necessary to the economy, look at what happen in Japan low rates caused exactly this, and the house prices collapsed when rates rose. Low rates are the cause but they do not make what is happening rational, by that logic japan was rational until it wasn't."

[This articles explains this all better than I could](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/GlobalWarming/page3.php) and [this page shows the correlation](https://www.sealevel.info/co2_and_ch4.html) of that and CO2 ppm found in Arctic ice cores, similar to cutting down a tree to see its age.

The reason why we are only now, over the past decade or so, starting to see the real effects of our emissions is because there is a buffer between emissions and subsequent temperature rise of roughly 30-50 years. By the time 2030 arrives we will be experiencing the emissions from the 90s and so on. As you can see our emissions grew exponentially from the 70s onwards and so the temperature rises are likely to be exponential too..."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Yup the climate has always fluctuated between the temperatures of -8 to 4 degrees C and over periods of almost 100,000 years. In just the past 100 years temperature has risen 5 degrees C in correlation to the massive amount of CO2 we have been polluting.

03/13/2021,stocks,Curious what your thoughts are on NVDA if they aren’t allowed to acquire Arm. I have a few shares of Nvidia mainly for the Arm acquisition as it’s clearly not priced in and for me  the reward of acquiring Arm is greater than the risk of it being denied. But to be honest I haven’t made my mind up if I’ll still hold them if it gets denied because it’s just a few shares.

03/13/2021,stocks,I’m obviously not as bullish without arm but I still think NVDA is a strong hold forever. NVDA strength in data centers is amazing. And that segment is only going to continue to grow. The work they are trying to do in ai is fantastic. And their past history in building the premier hardware in pretty much any segment they try is enough for me. Currently I think they are slightly overvalued if the arm deal fails. But if it succeeds they are definitely undervalued so it’s an interesting time to trade them.

Yes, I did say I’m being “downvoted” in my edit, but did I say “You have to upvote or agree with me or you’re an id***”. No I didn’t, but I did say you are an id*** if you choose to stay in your echo chamber. There’s an obvious difference, and saying the latter is not “seeking validation” in any way, I’m just recommending something an individual with a functioning brain should do. Not everyone is an “upvote whore”. Learn to stop assuming.

Your thinking is why society has so many sheep, seeking validation in their own echo chambers and shunning evidence that supports a contrary viewpoint. In fact, you thinking this already makes you a sheep. Do better."

03/13/2021,stocks,"Apha hasn’t added numbers from SweetWater yet, and in the last months both APHA and TLRY have made massive agreements across Europe and even New Zealand. TLRYs future prospects needs be to accounted for when you’re doing your evaluation. The floor/ceiling compared to other cannabis is unreal and in a lot of ways the safest bet."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Curlf also acquired emmac which is the largest cannabis company in Europe, which isn't included in the 1.3 guidance...

Tlry & Aphria massive deals in euro and new Zealand < emmac

Ok since we are taking Europe out of your original comment, and I take it out of mine, all you really said to me was Sweetwater deal will make them more revenue then curaleaf, so Sweetwater is worth 600 million in revenue? Delusional."
03/13/2021,stocks,I’m saying making deals with countries and major hospitals is of greater importance than acquiring the biggest cannabis company in Euro.
03/13/2021,stocks,"Still dunno why you commented.? I understand why you said Europe, I basically said Curlf is doin these as well, but better. So we can just cancel out those unknowns. Curlf brings in more revenue. You also said Sweetwater isn't factored in. I said unless Sweetwater brings in 600 million then it's not bringing in more revenue then curlf. This makes curlf the biggest cannabis company. We still have other mso's to report, so as of right now curlf is top, and aphria likly isn't even 2nd, probably not even 3rd. Cresco labs might even knock them as low as 5th."

03/13/2021,stocks,"If everyone felt like it was going to be a squeeze retail would've bought in, and this would be getting more coverage. There's just a lot of uncertainty, and the thought of a false positive causes hesitation. But, the options chain, recent action, and ortex stats (util is over 100) mean that there is a potential for a really big upwards move, regardless if you can call it a ""short squeeze"". And, it's definitely not just the stock ""recovering"". Something else is going on.

Will it be like GME? Nah, I don't think so. But Friday's action points to shorts hedging with long positions. They too want a piece of the action coming up and want to minimize loss. But of course, it's all in the air.

By the way, I'm in at 200  3/19 contracts that were bought when the price was still low 11. Didn't sell at this dip. Didn't sell (but probably should've to buy in) when the price touched $16. I honestly believe there's quite a ways to go...

We'll see on Monday :)"

03/13/2021,stocks,"It's definitely a squeeze.

As GOEV was crashing, we saw massive call buying every single day. What this did was set up massive upward pressure once the crash ended. Whoever sold those calls ended up finding themselves massively short GOEV once price began bouncing back up.

As price kept increasing, the delta on those calls increased, which caused the option sellers to be even more short. That's the gamma squeeze in effect."

If PLTR has so much growth potential, why do the insiders never buy the stock?

03/13/2021,stocks,"It's honestly not a huge deal overall.  Most 3rd party tracking cookies have been being blocked for awhile.  Like 60% desktop and 75% mobile.

Cookie matching is not very effective, either.  40-60% match success.  

Marketers will continue to pay money to the largest platforms.  First party data will reign supreme for awhile (Google, FB, Amzn kill it).  Ads will use different targeting methods.

In the future there will likely be a centralized standard for 3rd party tracking which protects privacy."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Targeting is not the problem. Big companies will be able to integrate their servers for 1st party tracking, but I don't see small businesses being able to do it. The problem is the conversion path. i.e. exposure -> checkout. 

Social media already has low paths to conversion vs. search. The majority of sales are view through conversions that need to track people once they switch from that platform to the browser. Now that the view through is being removed, the numbers will simply drop for FB/PIN/TW/LI etc. The small companies that won't be able to setup custom conversions will just exit these platforms once they start seeing 90% less of sales. 

I don't know what new tracking solutions you are hearing, but I work in the business and PINS doesn't have a new one yet. TW & Google are the only ones that have revealed their potential new solutions. So until this happens and checkout data remains consistent, I'm not a fan of these companies."
03/13/2021,stocks,"What metric are you using where this change will mean 90% less sales?  The old methods weren't even that far off the current ones if memory serves.  


Other browsers have already done this.  As stated above, in the last few years most of the 3rd party tracking cookies have started being blocked.  And yet, there was not a drastic drop in revenue.  


In addition, PINS makes most of it's revenue from their 'Promoted Pins'.  users favorite things on the site and that data is used to promote advertisements in the form of pins.  This is primarily a 1st party endeavor. I do not see how PINS could lose a significant portion of their revenue from this change.    


In addition, in several years we will likely have a privacy centric Ad Id which does not  expose the user's personal information.  


PINS also uses Google Analytics for a lot of their stuff."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Facebook said already they estimate a 60% reduction in sales. Source: https://www.facebook.com/business/apple-ios-14-speak-up-for-small-business/impact-on-ads-marketing

Next we add in android who said they will follow suit I'm 2021 and we lose the rest. The reason why it is not 100 is you still get pixel tracking for 1 day conversions. I.e. if you click and buy the same day you can still track. There will also be people that opt in and change their settings. However, I doubt many will opt in. The biggest problem is you lose the saw ad but didn't click or clicked but didn't convert until a week later. These advertisers basically get removed from the sales credit. I.e. it looks like your ad dollars are not generating any revenue. 

It isn't the same as 3rd party going away on Firefox or safari because the work around was to have a prompt or install a first party cookie. Keep in mind chrome still allows third party cookie tracking which is over 50% of the market. The only solution now would be to match back on the company side, the path to conversion and pass the data back to each platform via api. This method also doesn't solve for double counting conversions. 

Google analytics is being hampered as well. They are already estimating off of Android data to back fill ios data. Their new name solution is called FLoC. It's not out yet, but Google is boasting a 95% as good solution. We shall see, but these social media companies need a similar one in order to not lose credit for sales. Until I see a solution, I'm not a fan. 

Q1 will be semi okay as ios14 wasn't released till recently. Also the Android privacy hasn't followed suit yet and just gave a vague 2021 date."
03/13/2021,stocks,been holding 501 @ $11.65 since jan .. right there w u brotha 💪🏼
03/13/2021,stocks,"look reading back my comment I did a terrible job to getting my point across, but:

activision is totally comparable, they
- compete for the same eyes (albeit activision covers slightly older demo and roblox slightly younger) 

- activision makes more games but that should account for higher market cap no?

- both focus on subscription/in game currency for 
- similar market cap

but here is the real reason: do you really want to try to tell me that roblox (38M) is worth more than half of: 
Activision(72M):

Call of Duty
+ Guitar Hero
+ Overwatch
+ Destiny
+ Candy Crush
+ Diablo 
+ WoW
+ Hearthstone
+ Skylanders
+ many more!!! ?

imo candy crush + wow + overwatch + MAYBE call of duty = roblox, and thats still sparing guitar hero, destiny, the whole Diablo series

currently from this active player website:
Roblox has 476,939 players RIGHT NOW. this is after the IPO, all over the news headlines, EVERYWHERE

The current call of duty has 370,000 avg/day in the middle of the game lifecycle (pops every October/November), I’m sure candy crush is blowing both of these out of the water. stock is overvalued plain and simple; I’ll be going to college paying in robux when I buy in mid 30s low 40s

can u explain to me what u mean by it didn’t IPO?
IPO = Initial Public Offering -> initially offered to the public two days ago so many I’m confused but it IPOd no?"
03/13/2021,stocks,"You have to account for the fact that most children who play Roblox are sleeping when you got your active player count. Ive checked the numbers before and have seen over 1 million players online at once. And Activision does *not* make more games. Roblox's game engine is what allows for the large production of games by creators. Creators are making new games daily, adding to the already enormous amount of games available. 
According to Christian Amado from Quora, ""If 0.2% of the ROBLOX players are experienced Developers. That means 260 thousand of the total players are devs.
A good ROBLOX developer may have done 2 well-made games open to the public.
That means 520 thousand of the ROBLOX games are well-made.
And there’s a total of 1.3 billion of ROBLOX total games.""
(https://www.quora.com/How-many-games-are-in-Roblox?share=1)
And that was over a year ago!


Activision has not even made 1% of the volume of the *good* games Roblox has, according to their wiki (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activision)

They arent in the same ballpark. Roblox is user-supported, while Activision makes games with smaller teams employed by those who don't always know what their consumers want.

maybe you’re onto something with the whole roblox dev part which I didn’t take into account. But I think those numbers are a little too optimistic on both the amount of good games made and good games/dev

+ you’re relying on 10 year olds for profit margins instead of algorithms that are meant to suck you dry with subscriptions

I think the method is sound - the problem comes in when we think about what parameters are to be used. There are around 5 numbers we can tweak which would give us quite different results. The main being growth rate.

So if analysts upgrade the stock by a lot, what they're essentially saying is that I should revise the growth rate to make it higher. Not sure if this answers your question."
03/13/2021,stocks,That's pretty smart - would be fun to include. I'll let you know when I add it. Thanks!

03/13/2021,stocks,"Hmm, I wonder if there's a better source for that data than Yahoo that you can crawl or hook into... or, rather,  you could add a prompt to enter a growth rate if no value is prepopulated."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Essentially, I'm planning to add a parameter for growth rate. If you don't specify anything, it would try to find it from yahoo finance.

03/13/2021,stocks,"Hey Boys. I called $46 on Thursday and I have another prediction for this week. 

Sentiment seems to bullish as we saw the market reaction to the high (1.6%+) 10 yr yield Friday and Nasdaq made a strong rebound into close. Monday will be super strong green Monday, I see us closing $48.50+... if I get the chance (depending on any small dips intraday or early in the session) I’m loading up on $55 April 26th calls. But why you may ask? Well I’ve done some research (took me 5 minutes) and there’s a lot of chatter about NIO closing on a huge deal with sinopec a battery charging station. And from what I am reading the first operating station will be launching 4/16. That being said, I believe (with my guessing and balls scratching) that NIO will announce this within the next week or 2.  Let’s face it, they are Chinese and when it comes to pumping they’re the best (coronavirus close 2nd). 
If you’re worried about the triple witching as I am on fridays end of session. I may be selling all my options early session Friday (when we pop at open) as we will probably be opening in the $54-56 range anyway. Then wait closer to end of day to buy all my options again (all in with my huge gains). 

We will see how this plays out and if my hunch is accurate. 

Declaimer: this is not financial advice, as I am not a financial adviser... I know nothing about the market in general and base everything on guesses and DD I do while I sit On the shitter."

03/13/2021,stocks,The ARK issue has been covered nicely in this video [https://youtu.be/oyVsADispX4](https://youtu.be/oyVsADispX4)
03/13/2021,stocks,remindme! 30days
03/13/2021,stocks,"$45 in 30 days? Put your money where your mouth is buy some puts Tuesday when they're available, I will match the amount in calls for the same expiration at a $45 strike."
03/13/2021,stocks,Lol...mate. Come back in ten years and show me how fucking roblox revolutionized the gaming industry and made you a fortune. Some people just don't have common sense...
03/13/2021,stocks,Should Amazon expanding its telehealth platform (Amazon Care) across the country be considered a threat?
03/13/2021,stocks,IMO it’s a good buy at a certain price. I bought in at about $4 a share and have been slowly adding more.
03/13/2021,stocks,Would you consider that”small splurge now at high of $24? I only ask because I’m thinking on pulling the plug and I hate that today is Saturday and not sure what will be on Monday morning.
03/13/2021,stocks,"Today being Saturday is the bummer. I was hoping to have more information yesterday, but Monday will be interesting with the morning webcast discussing the clinical data findings from the ongoing Phase 1/2 trial of RTX-240 in patients with advanced solid tumors. (Dang that was a long sentence. Oy!)

I think I’m going to get in a pre-market buy and keep my fingers crossed that the data shows promise. If it tanks from the $24, I’m okay with that because I realize the gamble I’m taking. However $RUBY even holding steady within the monetary parameters I’m happy with is good too. Best case scenario... good data and good profits. 

So I’m in... not that this is any kind of financial advice. I’m not a goob; I just play one on TV."
03/13/2021,stocks,"Hmm that last sentence peeked my interest, can’t lie

I was thinking the same but on a reserved amount, Friday was showing at $21 and today at $24 not sure if during the weekend and recent tweets spiked interest and there are many orders already waiting.

 Now I don’t like to buy at market value so I’m still gonna put a limit, I’m kind of new at this and very cautious, in all it looks promising so I think is worth the risk

What tv show are we talking here?"
03/13/2021,stocks,"First week update.

03/13/2021,stocks,"TRQ just listed on S&P TSX composite index. Looking even better for some heavy buying pressure coming. The last 2 days have been pretty good gains, but Monday will set off buying that nobody can control IMO."
03/13/2021,stocks,Stop worrying about what extra money you could make.  Be happy with what you did make.
03/13/2021,stocks,All these stocks are very expensive.. Do u know any such ticker under 100??
03/13/2021,stocks,It was a fucking blast made off with a very nice profit.

03/13/2021,stocks,"COST. Has been trading at 350 for the better part of 6 months, at 330 now and climbing slowly. I'm bullish on it and have been buying calls as the price moves. First time I bought calls and now I'm hooked :)"
03/13/2021,stocks,"Ironically, ive talked to 6 different liquor store owners i know and all of them said this last year was their best year ever for sales"
03/13/2021,stocks,"Just a craft beer drinkers take here. Bud and coors will always have a place in college parties because they are easy to chug. Or at a bar or event where you can decide between a single $15 craft or 2 bud lights at $7.50 each. But the next generation and everyone after that will be moving away from those beers and on to others with more taste. Between the 15-20 buddies from high school i still regularly keep in touch with, none of us buy coors or budlight anymore and that was our beer of choice throughout highschool and college. If you drink what your family and friends drink and everyone is drinking craft beers, then i assume most of our kids will end up drinking craft beers as well.

But all that being said, thats down the line and bud is a bad long term hold i feel. There are still plenty of boomers who grew up on bud themselves and are not going away from that, so post pandemic, yeah i can see bud spiking"
03/13/2021,stocks,"I’m holding both, but I’m less bullish on FUBO after just discovering they dropped the turner networks last year. It’s a curious move to get rid of a big portion of NCAA tournament games for a sports-first platform who also wants to launch a sports-gambling feature."
03/13/2021,stocks,I sold 20k of vti (100shares) and bought appl this week.
03/13/2021,stocks,Good luck to you too.
03/13/2021,stocks,If any y’all bought in - plus 10% and counting.
03/13/2021,stocks,"Good advice, Sir. I see recession as an opportunity too."
03/13/2021,stocks,Love FB long. All I see with bad news is buying opportunities.
03/13/2021,stocks,"I would disagree. In fact, what ive noticed since i started investing late October is the exact opposite. Just a personal tip in case you are not already doing this, but i will look at OPs post history and then of course read the comments sections to see if their DD gets picked apart by reddit. And for that, i really love reddit compared to just investing in a stock based on something i heard on tv which has nobody critiquing it. The comments sections tend to be a good way to decide if a DD is worth following or not (although not in gamestops case. Everyone picked apart DFV for an entire year on his DD)
So since early November almost all the stocks i put on my watchlist because of DD i saw on reddit either took off or had small gains. The steel stocks are just starting to take off right now, they were like the only ones still in the red up until like a week ago.
MT
CLF
VALE
FUBO
APHA
TLRY
ACTC
GME
AMC
DKNG
PLUG
AMD
these are the bigger names that pop up on my feed. A lot of smaller ones as well. 
Corsair gaming and palantir technologies are probably the 2 most disappointing right now as far as not coming to fruition, but both are longer holds so the jury is still out on them"
03/13/2021,stocks,"Same with NOK.  I am in both NOK and BB.  Every other day there is a new deal or great news.

Both have started to see momentum on Friday.
