If I buy an option contract from someone who write it for 40$ they get a $40 premium. If that contract goes up to $45 and I sell it I get the new premium giving me $5 profit and the original guy $40. My question is if that sold contract is exercised who‚Äôs on the hook for the shares? Is it the original writer or does the responsibility get passed along like a hot potato to anyone who sold that specific contract"
2021-03-13 18:39:13,Stocks,"The Irrational Motley Fool Hate For a sub dedicated to thorough research and controlling emotion, you guys sure are quick to jump on a hate bandwagon without doing ANY investigation on what you're trashing.

I think the confusion with TMF stems from the fact that all of their free articles are written by dozens to hundreds of different contributors, so of course they're going to contradict each other much of the time. Their free articles are not one person publishing two opposite opinions, it is roughly equivalent to what happens here: A contributor has an opinion on a company and gives their pitch. The next day, another contributor may publish a bear case for that company. Like this sub, some posts are an interesting jumping off point to start your own research, and some is ill-informed drivel. You're an investor, do your own damn research.

I know, I know. ""Nice try Motley Fool employee, LOL."" I have nothing to lose or gain here. I pay TMF $99 a year for some stock recommendations (that more than pay for the membership), and that's the extent of the skin I have in this game. I'll stop paying them that tiny fee when they stop making me money. The source of my frustration is that many of you believe yourselves to be knowledgeable and well-informed investors, but still haven't figured out how to google ""is The Motley Fool a scam?"" and taken a glance at some numbers.  


Rant over. I look forward to all the of the airtight ""but they send me too many emails!"" arguments."

2021-03-13 16:37:28,Stocks,"Assistance in Understanding Stock Buyback and Issuance of Stock Hi everyone,

I am a NOK shareholder and recently received an e-mail about an upcoming annual shareholder meeting.

In the profile there are two proposals:

Proposal #1: Authorizes the Board of Directors to issue shares and special rights to issue shares.

Proposal #2: Proposal to authorize Board of Directors to buyback shares. 

Both proposals indicate that either the buy-back or issuance would involve 550 million shares or not to exceed 10% of total share volume. 

Both authorizations would be effective until October, 2022.

Both proposals also note that ...‚Äùterminate the authorization for repurchasing the company‚Äôs share granted by the Annual Meeting on 5/27/2020.‚Äù and ‚Äú...terminate the authorization of issuance of shares and special rights granted by Annual Meeting on 5/27/2020.‚Äù

Can anyone help me understand these proposals?

Are shareholders voting to permit both of these or just one? If both are approved does it mean the company will buy back shares with the ability to reissue until 10/22? Or just one of these things?

Just trying to understand the possible outcomes of these proposals.

I will note that NOK is a bit of a meme stock and all I‚Äôm seeing are people hyping the ‚Äòbuy back‚Äô element while ignoring the issuance of shares proposal.


Any help or information greatly appreciated."

2. I am a price action purist meaning that I believe all of the information you need to know to make good trades are in the changing prices. You really don't need any other indicators.  
3. I am a conservative and methodical person. I understand that the longer you stay in the ""game"", the better chances you have for success. I am a big believer that it is a priority to protect your account.  
4. I am looking at different types of strategies from scalping to swing to a hybrid of both.

It‚Äôs even more pathetic when WSB tries to use TA, something that predicts movement based off of *patterns*, on GME, a stock that has had a completely unprecedented rise and is solely governed by sources such as news, tweets, hedge funds and market makers. 

I physically cringe anytime I see ‚ÄúDD‚Äù that involves a chart and every time I do see one, I instantly discredit the entire post. There have been many studies that prove the natural randomness of the stock market overshadows any patterns and predictions that could be made and your chance of predicting a stocks movement off of TA is basically that of a coin flip. Fundamental analysis, news and the current trend and sentiment of the market are infinitely more important for predicting a stocks immediate movement than TA could ever be.

The only glimmer of credibility I‚Äôd be willing to give TA is scalping but even then 90% of daytraders lose money so id say it‚Äôs not even paying off for them well in that regard either.

What it feels like to me is TA is a ‚Äúnoob trap‚Äù that attracts people who are new to the stock market because it makes them feel like they know what they are doing and they want an excuse to just gamble away their money. I‚Äôve noticed a lot of YouTube channels prey off of people thinking they‚Äôre some God of the stock market for employing TA and it gives them false credibility when in reality they‚Äôre just guessing as much as anyone.

I do understand it will hurt people but on the scale of economy it is really not really something like a crisis? What am I missing?

In the US, currently estimated with a few million families behind on rent. Even in the expensive state like California, the average is about 2% of household behind on rent with average amount of just $4500. That‚Äôs barely $400 million for California‚Äôs. Now scale that up at 2% of all households in entire US and say each household is behind by $20000, that will be an amount of $50 billion. 

Honestly, on scale of economy, $50 billion is practically peanuts. I mean take just Tesla for example, it gains and dropped well over $100 billion in valuation in one week. Also, 20k per household debt is nothing, average college graduates incur more debt than that. In the same time frame, US household saving rate is at record high at over 20%, that amount translates to a whopping $4000 extra saving per person. So there seems to be a lot of assets growth as comparing to debt. Of course the distribution is making economic inequality even worse.

2021-03-13 04:10:00,Stocks,"QFIN DD - 360 Digitech, Value play - Earnings on 3/15  *Join me on this rocket ship named QFIN.*

I have ventured out of my usual territory in my hunt for an exotic rocket ship-shaped banana, and I‚Äôve got good news for all ape-kind: I‚Äôve found one. Here‚Äôs my DD (whatever that means). 

Ticker: **QFIN**, AKA ""360 Digitech"". They are a Chinese Fintech company. Currently trading around $31.50. Market Cap is around 4.8 Billion. Very few people in America have heard of them. PE is less than 10, growth is insane, plenty of cash on the balance sheet, low leverage, etc. From a fundamentals or cashflow analysis, this is a banana mine. 

**Here's their business model:**

*First*, they use their online presence to advertise loans to the rapidly-growing Chinese middle class.

*Second*, they use their proprietary risk-assessment tools to analyze the credit-worthiness of the applicants. They also have proprietary identification tools to help prevent fraud and simultaneously speed up the loan process (this is a bigger deal than it sounds like due to the strong desire for convenience in lending) 

*Third*, they partner with banks to supply the capital for the loans. 

*Fourth,* they service the loans and deal with recovery in case of defaults.

The business model is important because in order to understand why this is an amazing buy you also need to understand where their revenue comes from. It's not just loan interest as you would expect.

**But first, let‚Äôs talk numbers.** 2017 Revenue: *175 million* 2018 Revenue: *3.75 Billion* 2019 Revenue: *6.99 Billion* TTM: *9.19 Billion* (TTM means trailing twelve months)

Obviously that‚Äôs insane growth. Most apes can‚Äôt even count that high. 

And yet, despite that growth, their P/E ratio is a measly **9.4!** *(P/E is a measure of how high up tree us apes must climb to reach banana, lower number = banana more soon)* **That‚Äôs less than half the P/E of the S&P 500** *(P/E: 27.5*), **despite having significantly more growth.** 

To understand why the stock is still so cheap, let‚Äôs talk about why dumb apes might *NOT* want to buy it. 

Firstly, I assume most of you haven‚Äôt bought it yet because you have never heard of it. Do a search for QFIN on reddit ‚Äì it‚Äôs next to impossible to find mention of it here. Furthermore, the trading volume is extremely low‚Ä¶. And most of the ownership is institutional. A few hedge funds, sure, but mostly ETFs, which is exactly what‚Äôs caused this great buying opportunity. As most Chinese Fintech stock prices have struggled lately with regulations (with the exception of this week), QFIN is relatively immune from the changes. QFIN has only gone down because most of the ownership is through the sector ETFs, which have been dragging QFIN down with them. Only recently did it buck the trend and move away from its sector's performance, in large part because people are just now starting to notice it.

This is a misunderstood company with obvious value. The play here isn‚Äôt that there‚Äôs extra value - the value is obvious to everyone - the play is that the ‚Äúproblems‚Äù are being significantly exaggerated and misunderstood‚Ä¶ so rather than tell you where the deep value is, I will instead focus on why the doubters are wrong and why QFIN is uniquely placed in its sector. 

**First Reason for Doubt ‚Äì Winnie the Pooh.** The Chinese Fintech industry has recently been slapped with some extra regulations that I had to get my mandarin-speaking wife to translate for me. 

One regulation is that for microlending transactions involving banks and partners, the partners (in this case, QFIN) must contribute at least 25% of the capital. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the rules: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-20/china-imposes-further-caps-on-online-lending-amid-clampdown](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-20/china-imposes-further-caps-on-online-lending-amid-clampdown). *The stock tanked 30% when this happened.*

**Why it doesn‚Äôt matter:** According to QFIN‚Äôs CEO, Wu ‚ÄúCock Slapper‚Äù Haisheng, *‚ÄúCurrently, the outstanding balance of the outstanding loans issued through our micro lending subsidiary, accounts for less than 1% of the total loan balance, and joint lending accounts for around 0.01%. Therefore, based on our personal evaluation, the new rules will have little impact on our loan origination business.‚Äù* 

Another new regulation is that online lending can only be done with banks that are established in the same province as the applicant. This is no problem ‚Äì QFIN has a multitude of partners in each region. There are other new regulations coming down the pipeline (capital requirements, etc) but QFIN is well capitalized and capable of overcoming all the known issues. 

**Second Reason for Doubt ‚Äì Default Risk.** There is concern that the loan default rate will be high, especially if China‚Äôs economy crashes, and that this will destroy the value of the company similarly to what happened to US banks with bad mortgages in 2008.

**Why it doesn‚Äôt matter:** First of all, *sack up.* 

Now that we‚Äôve covered that primary reason, the fact of the matter is that default risk will always be a thing for banks. But QFIN isn‚Äôt a bank. *(Actually, they technically do have a banking charter in case they have to become one for due to new regulations, but they aren't currently using it.)* Remember their business model I mentioned earlier? 

*Now consider this:* 

Remember that 9.9 billion revenue for the trailing twelve months? Of that 9.9 billion, 2.3 billion is interest income. *(600mm interest expense).* Meanwhile, **they‚Äôre receiving 8 billion in service revenue**. (source: [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/QFIN/financials?p=QFIN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/QFIN/financials?p=QFIN)) They‚Äôre bringing in far more money from loan origination commissions and the SaaS fees for their credit analysis than they‚Äôre bringing in from actual interest income. In other words, they aren‚Äôt a bank. What‚Äôs even more important is that QFIN literally does have the best proprietary software, as evidenced by the default rates of their loans. Compare QFIN‚Äôs loans defaults to FINV‚Äôs, who shot up *90%* yesterday after their earnings call. Go to slide 17: [https://ir.360shuke.com/static-files/6ffd9815-c5d3-478e-81df-0f4b3eb1ad0f](https://ir.360shuke.com/static-files/6ffd9815-c5d3-478e-81df-0f4b3eb1ad0f) 

If you‚Äôre too lazy to click the link, the TL DR is that QFIN‚Äôs historical defaults for every tranche is significantly lower. 

Another facet to consider is that even if their interest income does drop significantly, their operating margin is strong and, more importantly, improving. Despite their revenue increasing significantly, ‚ÄúTotal operating expenses, excluding provisions were roughly flat Q-on-Q but decreased 33% year-on-year. The year-on-year decline mainly reflects significant improvement in operational efficiency‚Äù ‚Äì CFO Alex ‚ÄúOh God Please No Not My Face‚Äù Xu 

**Third Reason for Doubt ‚Äì uNaUdiTeD fInAnCiALs**

OK so this is the best criticism the bears have. It‚Äôs also the most nebulous. 

A few things to think about: 

This is a Chinese company with Chinese consumer loans on their balance sheet. The QFIN ticker is an ADR. I‚Äôm not an accountant, but AFAIK all of the Chinese fintech companies without a US presence use unaudited financials. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that weird. 

Speaking of accounting, QFIN has a history of overestimating expected losses. *In other words, they used pessimistic estimates that make their financials look worse than they really are.* Back in 2Q2020, Chinese regulators slapped a cap on the interest rate of internet-sourced loans. Some of QFIN‚Äôs loans at the time were above that rate, meaning they were impacted. An unscrupulous CFO would not have marked down the loans in anticipation of a decrease in value due to the new, lower interest they would be receiving*. QFIN did the opposite ‚Äì they devalued the loans by too much* (mostly because they overestimated the default rate). ‚Äú...the high take rate for capital-light model in the third quarter, maybe partially contributed to a reversal of the charge in the second quarter.‚Äù ‚Äì Ethan ‚ÄúProlapse King‚Äù Wang, paraphrasing something the CFO took two minutes to explain when asked why the loans were doing better than anticipated after being devalued.

**What risks are there still?**

First and foremost, macroeconomic risks. As the Chinese consumer fares, so does QFIN. I view this as a good thing, not a bad one, but it does constitute a risk. Additional regulation from Winnie-The-Pooh represents a risk too, but it looks like, for now, that storm has mostly passed. My take is that the Chinese regulators seemed to have a hard on for fucking up Ant Group ‚Äì a spinoff of Alibaba. Jack ‚ÄúActual Vampire‚Äù Ma had mouthed off publicly about regulations and so the CCP went after him with even more regulations after disappearing the guy for a month. Ant Group focuses more on microlending, but QFIN‚Äôs stock, as another Chinese Fintech company, got dragged down by the bears despite not really being affected. Ant group is finally approved for their IPO, so it looks like Winnie‚Äôs red rocket for regulation is rapidly retracting.

**Any big banana showers coming soon?** YES! **Earnings call on 3/15!** QFIN has a history of smashing earnings estimates. If QFIN has even half the success of FINV, who went up 90% on the day of their earnings call, then it‚Äôll be bananas for everyone. Apes taking a rocket ship to banana planet. 

If you still aren‚Äôt convinced just look at the fucking fundamentals you god damn baboon. 

TLDR: I like the stock.

*This is obviously not financial advice.*

I‚Äôm new to this sub so I hope this is the right place to post.

Just turned 18 a couple months ago and I just got around to converting my Custodial account into my own personal account no longer under my parents control. They are still added as trusted advisors (or whatever Schwab calls them). 

Some context about me, my experience, and my end goals: I have about $5k (mostly unrealized) in my account (and a little bit more in a Roth IRA, but I‚Äôm not looking to do a ton of trading in that account). My parents have taught me a lot about the market and set up a custodial account a few years ago and asked me what I wanted to invest in. I currently own 4 shares of ADBE (bought at $285/share), just over 21 shares of AAPL (bought at $52/share), and I just sold the last of my 3 shares of MRNA for a decent profit. I know how the stock market works, how options work (although I don‚Äôt believe my account is approved for options trading yet), etc etc. Basically, I know how things work, but I don‚Äôt know how to play things necessarily. Obviously I know when to buy and sell in general but I don‚Äôt know how I should play the market long term.

My questions are what should my strategies be to making term profit, and still have a bit of fun? ;) Should I look into options trading (yes I know about r/options )? How much of my earnings should I devote to investing? What kind of stocks should I look into buying? How should I research stocks? Any and all advice would be appreciated! 

Thanks!

I know I'm not investing big money but to me its a good amount and I am learning. I'm looking for some insight on my goof and what you would do in this situation. 

A couple of days ago I put $1000 into CSTR.V when it was at $0.52 a share. I saw how much it was going up in the past and after some research I thought it was due to go up more. By end of day it dropped to $0.35 cents a share. So I'm down pretty hard relativity speaking. 

I was wondering what is the strategy now? Do I buy more at the lower price? Do I wait it out? Do I sell? 

For now I'm just going to hold and see what happens. The $1000 i put into it I consider ""gone"". I was wondering if there are other indicators or strategies I can look into at this point.

I have 6 months set aside as an emergency fund in the bank.

I have 35% of my net worth sitting in a brokerage account that is 90% cash at the moment.

I got the additional cash in the brokerage account from the sale of a house and with the low interest rates decided to take out the larger mortgage and make the cash work rather than dumping it into the house. It was gaining 1.5% in a money market account but is no longer.

*If you had a 90% cash portfolio right now and already had a very large exposure to stocks in your retirement account would you buy additional stocks? What other choices are there?*

I guess this is the reason we are where we are with the stock market. It keeps growing because there is nowhere else to go with our money.

Happy Friday everyone!

What a god damn close. Almost hit that $12 mark but couldn't quite squeeze it out, my thanks to all of you beautiful people who bought in the last 15 minutes of trading. 3.2 MILLION shares traded in the last 15 minutes to try and reach that strike price of $12. We still have after-hours to look at, so we may actually close at or above $12. We met our max pain of $10, which is amazing. Up 23% on the week, incredible.

Thank you all for averaging down, and buying the dip. We are going to have A LOT of eyes on us this weekend and next week as well. Keep accumulating, keep holding, and let's keep the momentum up.

Let's take a quick glance at the chart, as well as options for March 19.

We are above the 50-day moving average and have just blown past a golden cross, a bullish signal.

Hourly: RSI screaming overbought. Looking like a retracement imminent.  
Bollinger bands are expanding, this is good, but we are not respecting the bands and are pressuring outside of them. Every time we've overextended the bands we retrace.  
Monday morning we might expect a gap down to correct ourselves but I will remind you that this would be a healthy retracement.  
4-hour: RSI almost overbought. A cool-off may need to happen.  
Bollinger bands slightly beginning to expand and we hugging the top. If we keep hugging the top this is good. The bands didn't get as tight as I wanted but that's okay. This could be a signal we remain moving up.

Daily: RSI smack dead in the center. Very healthy.  
Bollinger bands are contracting more and more. If they keep getting tighter and tighter we may see a massive break out in the coming days.  
4/5 days this week have been green. I like green crayons. They taste the best.  
This is the highest daily volume we've had since March 4th and before that, Feb 25th. I remind you though 3.2 million of those shares came up in the last 15 minutes of trading to try and reach that $12 strike price.

Weekly: RSI slightly to the overbought side but still moderately healthy.  
Bollinger bands are still wide.  
Our first green candle in the last 7 weeks, and it is a big one. The second-lowest weekly volume that we've had since the beginning of the year. This is huge because we don't need volume to move up. This means people are not selling and are accumulating. We know this to be true because of my previous posts of big institutions are buying.

Hit ctrl + F and find them on [https://fintel.io/so/us/bb](https://fintel.io/so/us/bb) if you want to see. Don't just take my word for it, I'm dumb. DYOD.

Monthly: Fuck you. Not relevant right now. Shut up.

Every whole number ($10.00, $11.00, $12.00, etc for you dingbats) will be a theoretical line of resistance we will need to push through. Each will be somewhat difficult, but not near as hard as the one I have set \~$14.44. This one was the gap-up signal to the upside and was used for the bounce on Jan 28th, acted as support on Feb 1st, and then resistance on Feb 8th. Once this is secured we will need to get past it, retest it as support, and if it acts as support this $BB will absolutely fly.

Options baby, taken from [http://maximum-pain.com/options/bb](http://maximum-pain.com/options/bb) for March 19th, 2021.

Total Open Interest Calls: 198,238  
Total Open Interest Puts: 59,407

Put/Call ratio: 0.29. This is low as fuck and can be considered incredibly bullish. To be bullish, the ratio typically sits below 0.70.

The highest call open interest? 15.00 at almost 24k open contracts, second highest is $20.00 at 20k.  
The highest put open interest - 8.00 with 7k, second is 10.00 with almost 6.5k contracts.

Do I see 8 happening next week? No, I really don't. Are opinions like assholes, everyone has one.  
Could we close at $10 next week? Absolutely possible. We have signs that we could go in either direction.  
Max pain next week is $9. Should be easy, but so is yo momma.

My thoughts for next week? I don't fucking know. I don't have a crystal ball god damn it. Fuck off.

If I was a magician, I'd say it would be green. About the same % as this week but I have confirmation bias and I also beat my weewee to Kim Possible when I was a teenager. Your guess is as good as mine, but I digress. Lots of signals to go either direction.

This is not advice to buy or sell but a mixed bag of what's happening and the opinion of a degenerate. I love lamp.

According to Investopedia they say:

> **Why Is the 10-Year Treasury Yield So Important?**    
>  
>The¬†importance of the¬†10-year Treasury bond yield goes beyond just understanding the return on investment for the security.¬†The 10-year is used as a proxy for many other important financial matters, such as mortgage rates.¬†   
>  
>This bond also tends to signal investor confidence.¬†The U.S Treasury sells bonds via auction and yields are set through a bidding process. When confidence is high, prices for the 10-year drops and yields rise.  This is because investors feel they can find higher returning  investments elsewhere and do not feel they need to play it safe.   
>  
>But when confidence is low, bond prices rise and yields fall, as there is more demand for this safe investment. This confidence factor is also  felt outside of the U.S. The geopolitical situations of other countries can impact U.S. government bond prices, as the U.S. is seen as safe haven for capital.

Stocks traded mixed on Friday, with technology stocks coming under pressure once again as Treasury yields resumed their march forward. The Dow extended gains from yesterday, hitting fresh intraday records. The S&P 500 (SPY) opened in the red but managed to climb throughout the session to finish modestly green.

After months of negotiation, President Biden signed into law a new $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package after the bill passed in both houses of Congress by party-line votes. The bill includes provisions like $1,400 stimulus checks to most Americans, $300 per week in augmented unemployment benefits through early September, and $350 billion in state, local and tribal government aid. The bill comes exactly one year following the World Health Organization's formal designation of the coronavirus outbreak as a pandemic on March 11, 2020. 

The 10-year Treasury yield climbed more than 10 basis points to reach a fresh, one year high at 1.628%. This marks a rise of around 50 basis points compared to levels from a month ago. Yields are rising in response to inflationary fears and expectations for explosive growth as the economy reopens.  Kit Juckes, Societe Generale macro strategist, wrote in a note to clients, ‚ÄúThe pattern seems clear enough: The equity market is seeing a sector rotation but not a correction; the bond market is seeking a new equilibrium in the light of a vastly improved economic outlook in both the U.S. and elsewhere.‚Äù

Rising Treasury yields hurt high-growth stocks the most because high-growth companies generate most of their cash and earnings years down the road. Future cash decreases in today's dollars as rates increase partly because investors have more opportunity to earn bigger returns from assets paying higher interest and dividends right now.

2021-03-13 00:19:40,Stocks,"What is Roblox, Actually? I see a lot of posts comparing Roblox to regular game development or publishing studios trying to make sense of why it's valued at the price point it's at now.

To preface, I work in the technology industry amongst the giants (FAANG) and have met with plenty of operations engineers at various tech conferences that work at Roblox to better understand what they're doing, how they're doing it, and what their scope of work entails. It may come as a surprise, but Roblox isn't really a video game; Roblox isn't a game developer, nor are they a major publishing house that owns creative groups and studios like EA or Activision. Roblox is an open and free operations platform for small, independent game developers with a universal and aggressive microtransaction economy. Roblox the company does not really make games. They run them for other people and provide the tools and education needed to create that content.

There's a lot of stuff for me to explain here for people who aren't first degree constituents of the video game, entertainment, and technology market, so let's dive in:

What are the following?:

\- Game Engine

\- Microtransactions

\- DLC

\- Game Servers

\- DRM Platforms

Game Engines, much like Unity, Unreal Engine, Amazon Lumberyard, and CryEngine are software development toolkits. These are comprehensive all-in-one toolkits for putting together the assets that make a video game. These Engines typically cover things like 3D model animations, scripted events, programming logic, rendering and lighting, dynamic effects, and in some cases lightweight networking to support things like multiplayer capabilities. There is an entire market for Game Engines alone. Some of the most comprehensive ones such as Unreal Engine were used to build a staggeringly large amount of games which can be listed here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_Unreal\_Engine\_games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Unreal_Engine_games) (this list is also very much incomplete, which goes to show the vast amount of titles made in UE over the years). Game Engines exist to make a game developer's life easier, so they don't have to start from scratch having to write really rudimentary boilerplate code to get their idea materialized. If you're still struggling to understand this concept-- it's like a box of legos. Some lego collections are offered by different companies for their rich feature sets, accessibility, saturation of domain knowledge, and popularity.

DLC, or Downloadable Content, has been a core function of the video game industry since the days of Atari. Various games over the years have offered post-purchase content and updates to video games either as free options (which were used to build brand loyalty and trust with game consumers) or to monetize in layers, allowing a video game to rake in revenue beyond the initial box sticker price. Many video games have even been structured as a service-type offering, where the base game is quite small while the content itself is piecemealed as a vast library of DLC; Look at games like Rock Band, where acquiring all of the hardware and software/songs offered in the one game could cost a consumer north of $5,000. Yes, a video game that costs $5,000 in its entirety. [https://www.eteknix.com/rock-band-4s-dlc-costs-total-3926/](https://www.eteknix.com/rock-band-4s-dlc-costs-total-3926/)

In 2006, Bethesda took the concept of the DLC a step further and experimented with pricing individual in-game resources such as horse armor for a few bucks. They wanted to see if consumers would pay the usual $40-60 box sticker price of their game, plus an *optional* $2.50 for just one set of horse armor in The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. The gaming community was largely outspoken against these types of DLC, yet it remained one of the most purchased DLCs of the game, even two years beyond its original release date. There is an entire history on microtransactions and their titanic influence and significance on the video game industry, which I encourage anyone and everyone to read about. As an anecdote to frame this conversation: Supercell, a Helsinki mobile game developer that brought a game called ***Clash of Clans*** on mobile devices worldwide to 46 countries received only a few rounds of external investments at $12M and $130M before proceeding to rake in a staggering average of $1B per year in revenue from 2014 to 2016, which made the small game studio turn into a market giant in its area seemingly overnight. How? Clash of Clans pioneered a growing and popular strategy of charging for in-game-currencies called Gems which tap into root behaviors of human psychology that trigger in textbook gambling addiction. [https://www.tuw.edu/psychology/psychology-behind-microtransactions/](https://www.tuw.edu/psychology/psychology-behind-microtransactions/). By allowing players to accelerate progression in their game by using ""Gems"" which were purchased directly in their game, players (and commonly children) were able to swipe their credit cards frequently in order to get quick dopamine hits. With very basic game mechanics and a compelling system for purchasing this fake currency to progress in the game, they created an extremely low-cost revenue-generating behemoth.

The success of Clash of Clans alone deserves its own article to better educate what's happening to the video game industry as a whole right now, but I won't cover that. Mobile app markets like the Google Play Store and the iPhone Apps store are currently saturated with low-quality video games whose sole designs are to replicate the success of Supercell and their revenue-generating monster. You personally may have noticed an aggressive advertisement era as of late revolving around games like Arknights, AFK Arena, Raid Shadow Legends, or similarly titled/marketed video \*free\* video games on Youtube. All of them are designed to hook into your carnal desires and feed the gambling addict at everyone's core. They have increased spending on advertisement and marketing by 2x during COVID-19 because screen engagement and video game consumption has increased by the exact same rate during the pandemic-- and it pays off. [https://www.warc.com/newsandopinion/news/video-game-brands-spend-double-on-ads-during-covid-19-crisis/43652](https://www.warc.com/newsandopinion/news/video-game-brands-spend-double-on-ads-during-covid-19-crisis/43652) These aren't video games anymore. These are your modern-day casinos.

Now let's cover the primary cost center of this industry: operations.

The primary cost of any video game developer and publisher aside from game development itself is the knowledge, time, and materials it takes to develop, run, and deploy online video game infrastructure to serve consumers. This is similar to the material and production/manufacturing cost of any standard physical or tangible product or good. The servers, maintainers, elastic scaling capability, network throughput, geographical locations, application distribution all boils down to the bottom line of what it costs to launch a game in order for it to bring home revenue. Even in 2020, we saw major AAA game studios struggle in this regard. MMORPG games such as World of Warcraft, Everquest, and even lesser-known household names like Anarchy Online typically can often live or die depending on the success of their launch and how well they maintain their consumer base. It costs a lot to hire and sustain engineers that know how to build out server infrastructure, make an application widely accessible, highly available, with continuous availability. In many cases, this operational cost eats the revenue and can force publishers and game developers to scale down their applications or reduce their capacity of consumption. This also has impacts on the quality of services and geographical accessibility.

DRM Platforms, also referred to as Digital Rights Management Platforms, are platforms such as Valve's Steam, Epic Games' Epic Game Store, and EA's Origin assist with distributing video games to consumers, allowing them to build digital libraries of their purchases. This helps prevent piracy, but also provides a convenience aspect to acquiring copies of video game titles without having to resort to purchasing physical game copies in brick and mortar retailers. Microsoft also has a store like these built into Windows 10 that spans across the Xbox Live ecosystem, allowing people to pay for things like the ""Game Pass"" which is a blanket subscription to play temporary copies of video games that are not owned outright by consumers. This allows them to ration costs and revenue across multiple creative subordinates through the Game Studios program, which they are growing from purchasing game studios like Bethesda and Mojang in order to bolster the value of their subscription-based offering.

Before talking about what Roblox is in context, et's take a quick look at one of the most industry-changing games in the last 20 years: Blizzard's Warcraft 3.

In the era of the early 2000's, between 2002-2004, Blizzard released a game called Warcraft 3, as well as an expansion called Warcraft 3 The Frozen Throne. Along with this video game, they also released the World Editor, which was a map-creation tool for players to create their own content referred to as ***Custom Games***. The World Editor was essentially a small and limited game engine, allowing people to import custom models, model maps, and created scripted events much like a full-fat engine like Unreal Engine or Unity. People were creating tons of minigames, including a Mario Party ripoff called Uther Party, tag games like Tree Tag and Sheep Tag, party murder games like Murder in the Mansion, small ARPGs where you could load and save your character progression much like Diablo, as well as one of the biggest industry disrupters: DotA.

DotA, also called Defense of the Ancients, was a custom map created for Warcraft 3 and The Frozen Throne by a small group of players which gave birth to an entire genre of video games called MOBA or Multiplayer Online Battle Arena which spawned entire companies like Riot Games and their League of Legends market leader, which over time also evolved into the Battle Royale format we see in popular children's games like Fortnite. By leveraging the peer-to-peer networking offered by the Battle.net ecosystem of Warcraft 3, small individuals like you or me were able to materialize a game concept with little to no developer incurred operations cost, to then create a 40+ billion dollar industry outside of the game itself.

So how does Roblox play into all of this?

Roblox, much like Warcraft 3 from the early 2000's, serves as a development and operations platform for small game developers to materialize concepts, scale their operations, and monetize from their creations with almost no barrier to entry. The Roblox application itself isn't actually a game, but a browser for their massive marketplace of consumer-created content, almost like a YouTube of video games. You don't have to buy or download games, so it's not the same as a DRM platform like Steam, and they take care of running the servers for your games without exposing the creators to the cost and details of doing so. Instead of only relying on peer-to-peer networking which doesn't scale like Warcraft 3 (which had problems with more than 24 players), they have a completely transparent centralized server infrastructure providing operations for individual developers much like a service with zero upfront cost.

They focus a lot on enabling content creators and developers. They offer their own library of education and enablement at [https://www.roblox.com/create](https://www.roblox.com/create) to show people how to use and develop with their Game Engine. They don't charge licensing fees, and the engine itself is far simpler to use and more intuitive than others like Unreal Engine and Unity. You can see a wide gamut of content creators, from juveniles to adolescents, to professional adult game developers. If you are more curious about what Roblox the company actually creates, visit [Their technology portfolio here](https://corp.roblox.com/technology/#:~:text=The%20Roblox%20Reality%20Engine%20is,the%20capabilities%20of%20each%20device)

How do they make money? Microtransactions. Just like how Supercell created a revenue-generating monster with their single hit Clash of Clans and their Gem currency abstraction, the entire Roblox platform uses a currency called Robux. Robux is purchased for a lot of different uses-- player cosmetics, game purchases, priority serving on specific games, progression advancement, you name it. It's a single unified digital currency that applies to all content on the platform, and the individual developers of games historically have received a 30% cut of the purchases made in their games.

Roblox doesn't have to make any content-- they strictly focus on the technology enabling the entire Roblox game ecosystem. They aren't like any other game studio, because they aren't. You can think of them like a video game operations company that builds universal tools and the platform for people to create, share, and consume game content. Think of them as an all-in-one service provider for game devs. They distribute your game, run it, and give you the lego blocks to make it. They are the Unreal Engine + Steam + EA/Activision altogether. It has the potential to revolutionize how we consume video games, how we fund game developers, and how we advance Game Engine technology and capabilities. There is already a clone of every AAA game on their ecosystem-- Call of Duty? Bad Business. Counter Strike? Counter Blox. Murder in the Mansion? Murder Party. All of the cosmetic offerings you see generating revenue in free-to-play games like League of Legends exists across all of these mini-games as well, generating revenue for the game developers and Roblox themselves. You'll see lots of comments online with people saying ""My kid plays the crap out of roblox all the time and spends a bunch of my money on it"" because the platform encourages young kids to spend money on countless superficial content like avatars, skins, and progression through Robux. Imagine how impulsive adult consumers of League of Legends are and how much that has enabled Riot Games to grow with a single game offering. Now imagine the heightened impulsivity of a child on that same consumption platform with your credit card across the endless game offerings. It's a money-printing machine.

There's also huge runway for vertical growth for their company-- Game Engine capabilities, Roblox Client improvements, platform availability, external advertisement, and monetization models. The fact that people online are speculating on their value without understanding what the company does goes to show the hidden value in what they can provide to the industry, and what potential they have that is untapped.

People slept on Tesla, Netflix, Amazon during their initial phases as ""just a SF tech company,"" ""Just a mail-in blockbuster,"" and ""Just a book reseller"" without understanding the potential breadth of their disruption to what we now know today. To reiterate, I work in this industry and have had opportunities to talk with a lot of the engineers that run these systems at Roblox, and they are extremely knowledgeable and have a passion for doing things right. They use a lot of the same free and open source technology that we use to run cloud infra like AWS, Azure, GCP, and IBM Cloud.

2021-03-13 00:00:35,Stocks,"ETSY Long term investment SHOP - worth 140b

Google , Bing, all other search engine are monopolized by Amazon, Walmart, big corporations. No amount of SEO will help you rank beyond the 5th page of google for major keyboards. That is simply because small businesses cannot outspend these big corporations, and not just spending, they got connections.

Etsy, on the other hand, is on par with Amazon and sometimes even rank 1. Pinterest also backlinks hugely to Etsy, both of high rankers. Etsy have direct buying experience. Their ad cost is SUPER low, lower than Facebook and google! How do they afford this? Because their business model is taking a cut on sales, and the cut is way lower than Amazon and other platforms. And the ad is just pure profit for them since seo ranking, pins, and on site. They only charge on purchase. 


Etsy is worth well over 50b! Shop is worth 140b, and SHOP is so bad for small businesses. It‚Äôs great for drop shippers, who just ship from ali express that takes 2-4 months to arrive at a 1000% mark up price. Furthermore, shop overhead cost doesn‚Äôt even help you with seo! You have to advertise yourself, and ad prices are outrageous now and targeted advertisement is dying with google and apple getting rid of it. These Shopify stores usually stay on page 500 on google never seeing the light of day. And as more people catch on to ali-express and their reverse image search, I‚Äôm assuming these drop shipping sites will probably wane, since ali-express is 100 times cheaper with same delivery time of months. 


Etsy is the only way to build brand recognition. They do not allow drop shipping for items that is obviously resell. This will increase customer trust as Amazon is just ali-express with fast delivery and shop stores are mostly just Wish clones marketing one product. As more and more people realize they are getting ripped off and not getting products in respect to its true value, more ppl will go on Etsy, where small business and crafters can scale and sell while having a relationship with customers. 


Etsy is undervalue! Even their ad model alone is worth a lot !"

2021-03-12 23:33:58,Stocks,"Canadian Tire and NuPort Robotics to Commercialize Canada‚Äôs First Automated Heavy Duty Trucking Technology Canadian National retailer Canadian Tire Corporation and Toronto based start-up NuPort Robotics Inc., Canada's first autonomous trucking company, have announced a partnership with the Ontario government to invest $3 million to undertake an automated heavy duty trucking project to test a first-of-its-kind-in-the-world technology.

The breakthrough technology provides a transportation solution for the middle mile, the short-haul shuttle runs that semi-tractor trailers make between distribution centres, warehouses and terminals each day. It is designed to enable next-generation automated trucks that are more fuel efficient, safer to operate, and provide an enhanced driver experience.

Backed by $1 million in support from the Ontario government through Ontario's Autonomous Vehicle Innovation Network (AVIN) and matched by $1 million investments from Canadian Tire and NuPort Robotics, respectively, the two-year project is applying proprietary, artificial intelligence (AI) technology from NuPort Robotics to retrofit two conventional semi-tractor trailers - which will always be attended by a driver - with high-tech sensors and controls, a touchscreen navigation system, and other advanced features such as obstacle and collision avoidance.

""Ontario is proud to be a global leader in automated and connected vehicle technology and this innovative project is an exciting milestone toward automated vehicle tech in the trucking industry,"" said Caroline Mulroney, Minister of Transportation. ""Ontarians rely on goods being delivered by trucks across the province every day and projects like this are demonstrating the ways that automated truck technology could help businesses meet delivery demands more efficiently while supporting a strong supply chain in Ontario.""

""This project applies unique and made-in-Ontario Artificial Intelligence technology that offers increased safety and efficiency, with a reduced carbon footprint, to the goods supply chains on which we all rely,"" said Vic Fedeli, Ontario Minister of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade. ""This is the latest example of how Ontario's Autonomous Vehicle Innovation Network acts as a catalyst, fostering partnerships between ambitious technology start-ups and industry to develop and commercialize next generation transportation technologies that strengthen our economy and benefit society.""

""The trucks are currently transporting goods between a Canadian Tire distribution centre in the Greater Toronto Area and nearby rail terminals within a 12.5 mile radius, and early results are promising"" said Raghavender Sahdev, CEO of NuPort Robotics. ""The aim of the project is to develop a system that incorporates an autopilot feature for conventional trucks with a driver, leading to the most efficient way to drive and increase safety. The sensors work as a ‚Äòsafety cocoon' to cover blind spots and prevent accidents and the end result is peak fuel efficiency, meaning lower carbon emissions, and peak driving performance for an overall more optimal transportation experience.""

NuPort Robotic's approach to autonomous trucking is unique in the industry because it focuses only on solving the middle mile challenge, using a known set of predetermined trucking routes that are repetitive and high frequency as opposed to general highway driving. Ultimately, when implemented on fixed routes in the future, Canadian Tire will benefit from faster commercial deployments and improvements in supply chain sustainability.

""Canadian Tire embraces innovation and is always testing new technologies to improve our operational efficiency and safety. As proud Canadian companies, the safety of all stakeholders, including drivers, employees, customers, and public will be the top priority as we work together towards deployment of this technology,"" said Gary Fast, Vice-President of Transportation, Canadian Tire.

""Over the last three years, Canadian Tire has made a significant effort to solve complex business problems by using the Canadian start-up Artificial Intelligence ecosystem, and NuPort Robotics exemplifies what we look for in a start-up with a focus on innovation, automation and artificial intelligence,"" added Cari Covent, Vice President of Intelligent Automation, Canadian Tire.

""As NuPort Robotics continues to develop new technologies to overcome middle mile supply chain problems and advance autonomous trucking, I am extremely grateful for the support of the Ontario Government through AVIN and the Ontario Centre of Innovation. With their continued support, we are striving to position Canada as the leader in autonomous transportation,"" Sahdev said.

I recommend you read his DD first then come here. Seaworld has climbed from low $30s to $50+ in one month. $20 to $50+ in 6 months.

[This](https://imgur.com/s1WtnoL) graph sums it all up. Seaworld is in blue. Six Flags is in Yello. Even if you're extremely bullish on amusement parks, something is *seriously* wrong here.

&nbsp;

*How did it get this way?*

The small float at 50 million shares and incredibly high institutional ownership with low volume translates to it being easily manipulated. Institutions got lazy and let this thing slipway past where it should have gotten. Retail investors that are long on SEAS are rare and the ones remaining are going to pull out now.

In other words, if take your üí© and make it look like a [chocolate bar](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Cadbury-Dairy-Milk-Caramel-Bar.jpg), no one will be any the wiser as long as they don't get close enough to sniff.

""Just skimming the fundamentals, this company looks like absolute dogshit."" -/u/ethandavid

Seriously, there is no bull argument at all for this being above $20, and this stock is starting to *stink*. 

Check out this article: [SeaWorld attendance dives 53% in the final quarter of 2020, but stock soars](https://www.orlandosentinel.com/business/tourism/os-bz-seaworld-earnings-covid-rebound-20210225-fs7wmwm3zrh7jlzwm5qdsbdz7y-story.html)

A small dip in the fake momentum and this thing comes **tumbling down**.

&nbsp;

*But what about the cute killer whales? I'm not evil!*

Watch Blackfish. It would be doing them a favor if SeaWorld was bankrupt.

Even without that knowledge, the company itself is run by some really scummy individuals. 

The starting wage at SeaWorld Orlando is current $11 an hour. Instead of raising the minimum wage, the CEO plans to ""increase automation efforts overtime"" to solve their cost problems. Not only are your Orca's being kept in a cage, but they also won't even pay the people to take care of them.

&nbsp;

*But we only know how to get tendies with undervalued stocks!*

Indeed young one, but everyone can learn. The bold get the tendies. 

You usually need to apply to get shorting approved on your margin account. Fidelity has a pretty quick turnaround time, so if SEAS is still above $40 by the time you get approved it can be a great play to make.

There is a lot of benefit to having at least one bear position in your portfolio. Probably even more than one right now.

Long puts work too, but I recommend shorting since it is less a question of *if* and more of a question of *when* the stock tanks. Even bankruptcy is not out of the question as /u/cyphonismus explained in his DD.

There is a reason hedgies love it.

Not your typical old-school dividend player as it is a Business Development Company (BDC) so it raises capital and invests in small and mid-size companies. It also pays 90% of its taxable income in dividends, similar to REITs. 

It has just been upgraded to Buy by Zacks (see below)

******************


Ares Capital (ARCC) Upgraded to Buy: Here's What You Should Know
Mentioned:	ARCC
Investors might want to bet on Ares Capital (ARCC), as it has been recently upgraded to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). An upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices -- has triggered this rating change.

The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company's changing earnings picture. The Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years is tracked by the system.

Individual investors often find it hard to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts, since these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time. In these situations, the Zacks rating system comes in handy because of the power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements.

As such, the Zacks rating upgrade for Ares Capital is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price."
2021-03-12 22:50:14,Stocks,"LVMH vs. Kering: what's your take? Fellow community, I was recently thinking about luxury brands and retail. It is a high margin business with strong brand recognition, brilliant marketing and a bright future (especially in Asia). Luxury is becoming more unisex, not just women are interested in those products and brands.

More and more people can afford those products and will buy them in the future. Without wanting to delve deeper into the luxury brand business, there are two big players worldwide: Kering and LVMH. What strikes me about both of them is that they both have good margins, but they also have high valuations. The brands that belong to both companies can be found on Wikipedia. LVMH, for example, is the only one of the two with a significant presence in the alcohol business, so there are certain structural differences.

Which of the two companies would you prefer and why?"
2021-03-12 22:47:37,Stocks,"L Brands (LB) - overhyped stock that could crash  L Brands (owner of Victoria's Secret and Bath and Body works) has been on a meteoric rise, hyped by investment analysts. It's in a classic bubble. Today the stock rose nearly 10% because the board revised earning projects and initiated a stock buyback. Not sure what factors have led this company to believe its earnings will be that good, when its business has been hugely impacted by the pandemic.

At its core, the Victoria Secret brand is a losing business. It's based in shopping malls, which are closing left and right and are on a tremendous decline. Its products are not unique, there are many other brands and stores selling same cheaply made underwear. The stock has had an average PE of about 12, right now its at 18. Retail industry is in a very tough spot, L Brands does not have a strong e-commerce presence.

Another hyped stock is AMC. It's been declining even BEFORE the pandemic, yet it became a meme and is rising. AMC is in a huge debt hole, with more than $11B in debt and $400M in cash. The interest on that debt is going to financially choke this company. It will be a penny stock."

2021-03-12 21:52:33,Stocks,"Do your reading - The Roblox S1. (DD) Hello everyone. 

So, I've made a smattering of posts throughout the run up to Roblox's DPO yesterday about this company. I've been admittedly bullish on this company since I started looking into it, and honestly the caliber of the majority of Reddit chatter is only reinforcing my outlook and it made me want to throw my hat into the ring and at least get the word out there that there is a logical opinion behind the other side of the coin (as far as the opinions on the valuation and the stock in general). The amount of times people called their event an IPO when it was actually a DPO, the amount of times people thought that the underwriters would screw them on price not realizing it was a DPO or the parroting of ""they've never made a profit!""... It has driven me to finally address some of these points in my own post and at least have a discussion about this other side of the approach.

To introduce why, I am a hobbyist index investor with most of my money going into the big boring haystacks through my tax advantaged funds like anyone else. The difference is I've always allocated a nice but sustainable portion of my money to my ""fuck around fund"", which is aptly named but of course I still try to win with. Thanks to a darling niece who took my money and put it directly into Roblox more than once, I found this company and I personally think its a blockbuster and I'll tell you why. I'll also try to address some of the common tropes I've heard about them.

**My excitement:** When I was a kid, I lived and died off of flash games in the school computer lab. I could be playing one thing at lunch and then another thing in the next minute when I died, and I don't know about all of you but I spent hours on those games even when I got home. I had a PS1 and a PS2 later on but flash games always held my attention due to the sheer ease of access as well as the variety of games right up until their twilight.

Now, my first point is folks who have kids... listen to them. Everything I know about the actual product comes from watching my niece play and very nicely taking me through why she likes it so much. If my flash games were Bruce Banner, Roblox has taken this idea and turned it into the Incredible Hulk. The freedom to jump between literally hundreds and thousands of games (some very well built with character triggers and NPC's) while keeping your avatar consistent, not to mention that the games are usually multiplayer so she can play with her friends that jump between these games as well. She spends a lot of (my) money buying parts of outfits for her avatar, and this is where paying attention comes in. 

The store is well done, the experience is smooth enough for her to take me through it without needing my help by and large and honestly if I was a kid I would most likely be hopping on no question especially with friends on the platform. This is how I got so interested, along with wondering where my damn five bucks went when I just gave it to her a day ago!

[Before we begin, link to S1 to follow along.](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1315098/000119312521049767/d87104ds1a.htm)

**Things to understand about this company.**

------------------------------------------------

***Roblox is not a game, rather it is a platform***. It is the Youtube of games, so to speak. Your player character is customizeable and consistent through the games you play, and monetization is centered around in game purchases as well as the clothing and gear your character carries between worlds. If I have to hear ""a game is worth $40M in market cap?"", I'll bust a vein.

**Most if not all content now is user created**. Recently, they've allowed developers to make items and sell them on their marketplace. *According to their S1 they're on track to pay their developers ~$250M dollars.* Its a lot and I've seen people complain about how much they pay the content makers, but its a movie akin to Netflix (which is itself, not a movie but a platform) investing in their own native content.

**Bookings, Profitability and Free Cash Flow (S1 Reference page 77 and etc.)**

We believe bookings provide a timelier indication of trends in our operating results that are not necessarily reflected in our revenue as a result of the fact that we recognize the majority of revenue over the estimated average lifetime of a paying user.

To me, a lot of people have suddenly become really ""fundamentalist"" regarding the word revenue and I don't think you can move forward in this age of investing if you aren't up on technology and wildly different business models than we are used to. Revenue for me is a word that represents something, not a dogmatic ""well akshually according to the book"" type answer. What it represents is: how much money does this venture make? For Roblox, I think bookings is the best way to represent this and if you follow just revenue you're lost in the past on this company, plain and simple. Both for the creativity of the business model itself, as well as the consequence of the longer you wait and the more their bookings increases ahead of their reported revenue the higher you'll have to buy in. You lose money on this one if you can't grasp this.

Starting off, this business model is fairly simple. You buy their currency, ""Robux"", and then you buy stuff in game as well as in their general marketplace. You might have seen the giftcards at Safeway, and now they even sell premium accounts that give you some every month. But when you buy 5 Robux, your money doesn't instantly get turned into revenue. Instead its called bookings.

If you check page 77, they talk about how they believe (and they are right, I feel) that because of the way they are forced to recognize revenue that bookings is a superior method of looking at their trends of success. Simply, they can't recognize the money someone uses to buy their Robux until that person does one of two things. To recognize the money exchanged for Robux as revneue the user who bought the Robux then has to satisfy one of two conditions. They have to either buy a durable item like a piece of clothing off of the marketplace, or they have to buy AND consume something like an in-game potion. Until this is done, they can't call it revenue much like a lot of gift card type deals. 

If none of this happens, the money is spread as revenue over the average 22 month life of a user. But as you'll see, these motherfuckers brought in nearly $2 billion dollars and are sitting on a mountain of cash and after expenses are adding to this dragon's hoard. 

**~923 million in revenue, $1.8 billion in bookings, ~$411 million in free cash flow, own cash equivalents of $893 million, and the choice of a DPO.**

>This company isn't profitable, hurr!

>They haven't made a profit since 2007!

Frankly put, this company makes a boatload of cash and after spending on things like marketing, their own data centers (they own their data centers and don't rely on say AWS), employees, taxes, the apple store, the xbox store, and their developers they still have about $411 million in free cash flow. Lastly, the fat cherry on top is that they have cash sitting in the form of $893 million dollars! Does this sound like a company in need of money? 

Secondly, and this annoyed the shit out of me is if you search Roblox IPO vs. Roblox DPO in the reddit search you'll be able to see how many people continued referring to this as an IPO. This may seem unimportant, until you realize that the goal of an IPO and a DPO are completely different and symbolize two different types of companies. In an IPO, a company is raising money by issuing and selling new shares. *In a DPO, the company allows employees to sell their shares on the open market to allow for liquidity.* Roblox was allowing their OG's to finally turn their monopoly money into cash, and taking advantage of the publicity this brought.

Why is this important, and why is characterizing their public offering as an IPO so wrong? Because in addition to the strong numbers they exhibit, they didn't need to raise any money. If this doesn't speak to you, I don't know what will. 

**32% of their user base is currently bringing in 68% of the money.**

If you can take a look at Page 88, as well as reference page F-17 you'll find two very interesting facts that paint a huge opportunity for growth for them that is easily within reach based on their performance since their inception in 2007. 

Basically put, 68% of their daily active users were outside of the US and Canada regions. These include significant proven growth that's happened in France, South Korea, Germany, and other places besides. But the funny shit is, despite this fact monetization in the USA far outstrips their global bookings intake. This is a great problem to have, because just as Roblox grew to serve an American market and attract American content makers over time you can expect the same behavior especially as the company starts looking to market and invest in people outside of America. Translators, localization, all this kind of stuff takes time and once people start seeing content geared to them in their local culture they're inevitably going to spend more money.

Given this, its a huge road ahead. If everyone monetized like the USA this year, the bookings (aka money coming in from selling their Robux) would be something like $6 billion dollars and more!

**China**

Roblox just got a license to operate in China, the most populous nation on Earth with the largest middle class and the biggest market for mobile games. I don't... know how to make this bigger. Seriously, over a billion people who love mobile gaming and in-game purchases with more people with money looking to play every year. And now Roblox is in the door.

**>comparison to gaming company**

Do people compare Netflix to Miramax? That's how ridiculous someone sounds to me when they bring up Take Two Interactive (who brought in about $3 billion in revenue in 2020) in comparison to Roblox. Dude, they serve different needs. My niece has a Switch and finds time to play Roblox as well as garden her little world in Animal Crossing and in fact has played more Roblox that I've seen than her Switch by a large margin.

**>comparison to Unity**

Again, different customers and different company. Unity sells a great engine to game developers who then have to take the costs of hosting, development, marketing and publishing onto their shoulders. When you're publishing on Roblox, you have hosting and development largely taken care of thanks to their creation tools and engine. Not only that, but you have a ready audience for your game.

I think people reach to compare Roblox to Unity because they can't fathom understanding this company without these comparisons. Just because they sell entertainment in the form of gaming at the end, what goes into it is completely different. Its like buying your own cameras and shit compared to just using Netflix's shit to make a movie and then giving them a cut at the end of the day.

**>muh flash in the pan**

Roblox has been around since 2007. They've been encouraging people to make things on their platform for damn near fourteen years now. Minecraft, Fortnite? Dude, they're the ones who have to prove their staying power and not Roblox.

**>muh Minecraft**

If you still can't get it through your head that Minecraft is a game, and that Roblox is a game development hosting and creation platform and you're still drawing comparisons you need to stop reading here.

--------------------------------------

**TLDR: They make a lot of money and a lot of boomers just can't grasp a successful business model.** 

All in all, I'm in with my whole slush fund and I knew they would open at higher than 45. If you think their valuation of $29.5 billion was too rich for you, I think there is something you're failing to understand about this company. 

I for one wasn't surprised when they settled at a market cap of ~$39B recently. I also wasn't surprised to see Cathie Wood jump in, and you know why? Because these people can take an hour to see ""hey, what is this company like numbers wise""? Altimeter and Dragoneer were goddamn lucky to get in at $41, by a long shot. Their S1 is staring you in the face at the top of this post, go do yourself a favor and make a long play. 

Airbnb made $2.52 billion dollars, and is worth about ~$120 billion dollars. Zoom is projecting to be bringing in $2.3 billion dollars and as of my typing this is worth ~$103 billion dollars. Roblox, currently, is sitting on a full year of bookings of $1.8 billion dollars. I know money coming in isn't everything and that growth is accounted for in perception, but dude... they're got a clear path and make only $500M less than Zoom and is valued at 40% of their business. 

32% of their userbase makes up 68% of the money coming in, and their work is cut out for them. If they can monetize their expanding userbase in the way they monetized the USA, they don't even need to fucking age up. *If you ask me, they're undervalued and there is a lot of money to be made here.*

Roblox has components of a social network, a game, a marketplace, and a classroom. Its pretty astonishing, and I don't think I see Fortnite's developers making seminars to use Fortnite in the classroom. The metaverse, an idea I first heard in Snow Crash is what they're after. Imagine learning about the Coliseum in Rome by walking around it in your avatar that is the same one you used to shoot down goblins just earlier. And then using that same avatar to buy shoes in the official Jordan Roblox store, looking at a few ads on the way. Do you see where I'm going?

Don't miss the boat because you can't fathom something. The fundamentals and the vision are there. You'll regret it in two years when the stock is at $150 and you're stuck wondering if you should've actually read that S1 instead of listening to people who only see stocks as pump and dumps."
2021-03-12 21:45:01,Stocks,"April ""correction"" prediction I predict around April 12 (or a bit before the CPI reports comes out), we are going to see a small correction. Why? Because that report will obviously be showing increased inflation. Why? Because in march 2020 nobody was spending anything. 


Is this a legit fear for the economy? Not at all. Its only going to be temporary inflation as Jpow said. The fact that we are spending more right now than in 2020 is perfectly normal and healthy.


But wanna bet that the media will push this ""inflation"" rise? They're going to say ""SEE WHAT DID WE SAY, INFLATION!"". Some hedge funds will move their money to safer stocks, some new investors will panic sell, and we should see some small corrections.


What does this mean for us?


It might be an ok idea at the beginning of april to keep some cash on hand, or invest in things less affected by inflation fears... and once it dips because of the CPI report, then it could make sense to buy the dip... except that we will probably get a second bad report in May (April 2021 will obviously have more spending than april 2020). But the point is... its probably going to dip in April/May and come back strong this summer."
2021-03-12 21:41:53,Stocks,"Buy Tencent(TCEHY) if you want to own Roblox(RBLX) with less risk I think Roblox is a great company with a bright future, but I also think they are incredibly overvalued. SURPRISE!!! You CAN be bullish on a company AND think it's overvalued. They aren't mutually exclusive sentiments! Luckily you can invest in RBLX by proxy by investing in Tencent(TCEHY)!  

Tencent is a Chinese company that is the gatekeeper for all video games in China. They are the largest gaming company in the world and they also own WeChat. 

Notable gaming companies in Tencent's portfolio include

* Riot Games(100% ownership)
* Sharkmob (100% ownership)
* Funcom (100% ownership)
* Supercell (85% ownership)
* Grinding Gears (80% ownership)
* **Roblox(49% ownership)**
* Epic Games(40% ownership)
* Fatshark (36% ownership)
* Kakao (13.5% owernship)
* Bluehole (11.5% ownership)
* Ubisoft (5% ownership)
* Activision/Blizzard (5% ownership)

Yes Tencent owns 49% of Roblox. 

While owning Tencent is a great way to gain exposure to Roblox, at the end of the day they are a Chinese company. Which means that comes with a lot of it's own risks due to China's authoritarian regime and geopolitical relations with the US."

Do PP‚Äôs typically move a stock in the positive direction? Or somehow the other way? 

Say a stock is trading at .43 cents. 

The stock opens the next day dropped off 30% down to .30 range. 

Then, shortly after the drop they announce a 25 Million Dollar PP @.30 with Warrants to buy more at .40. 

Could that drop somehow have been related to the deal being made at .30? 

Does the company issues new shares in these situations meaning they aren‚Äôt bought right off the open market? And thus won‚Äôt affect the price directly?  

Like, for instance. My brain wants to think in the mentioned situation that: 

‚ÄòOk, the stock was trading at .43, they had a lunch date or whatever and decided .30 would be where the deal was made. So they drove the price down from .43 to .30 to pick up his friends and his 25 Million Dollars in stock at that set price and then once they‚Äôre on board this thing will take off.‚Äô

Is that how this works? Or is it more like: 

‚ÄòWe‚Äôre off the market and we like what you‚Äôre doing and know you need capital so here gimme 25 Million Dollars worth of shares at say .30 with warrants to buy more at .40 and you just get this capital NOW to do whatever you gotta do.‚Äô 
 
As in, is it a sign of weakness like a company is needing money? 

But, I guess even in that situation that means the investor believes the stock will go up if he exercises warrants to buy more at a higher price.. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§î

2021-03-12 21:10:43,Stocks,"Past S&P 500 chart tells a different story then the narrative that we hear today I know there are some people here that have been around (investing) a lot longer than I have. I have only been heavily following the stock market since 2008. In the last 10 or so years I have constantly heard the narrative ""stocks only go up."" I have people around me that pull up the 10 year S&P 500 chart to prove how it is a no brainer to leave your money in the stock market. The media continually tells you active traders fail and index funds are a much better bet. The problem I see is that those statistics are all within the last 10 years typically. I also would like to point out that in the past there have been ACTUAL bear markets where your money did not move like it has in the last 10 years. Here are some interesting time spans going from the dot com bubble (yes I know how unique the dot com bubble was) to the following 12 years:

1/1/2000 to 1/1/2007 - $10,000 became $10,782.77 - Roughly 1% annual return over 7 years

1/1/2007 to 1/1/2012 - $10,000 became $9,912.96 - Roughly -.1% annual return over 5 years

Had you ""bought and held"" from 1/1/2000 to 1/1/2012 your .5% annual return would have left a bit to be desired.

Here is another interesting one. Let's say you bought at the bottom of the dot com bust in 2003 only to watch it all go away in 2009.

1/1/2003 to 1/1/2009 - $10,000 became $10,483.04 - Roughly .75% annual return in 6 years.

I realize those are some ""worst case"" scenarios but we don't even realize this as a possibility in ""investment circles"" today. Anyone talking about stocks and investments reference the last 10 years and it is always something positive (or flat). Maybe you have the people who pulled out at the bottom of the covid plunge but most people were wired to ""ride it out"" already and had a fairly large savings account. 401k plans didn't empty out like they thought it would. Today it is just a matter of ""when"" the stock price increases not a matter of ""if"" the stock price increases. Some will argue if you ""bought an held"" from 1/1/2000 to 1/1/2021 you would have $35,714.74 dollars. A roughly 6 percent yearly return. Though I would argue if you had bought in 2012 you would have same the returns as the guy who started investing in the 99-00s. This makes those 10 year investors extra bullish. It actually looks like this:

1/1/2012 to 1/1/2021 - $10,000 became $33,412.88 - Roughly 14% annual return over 9 years

My point is that humans forget very quickly. The people who have gotten involved in the stock market in the last 10 years have had a completely different perspective. They have seen double digit returns and never experienced a year over year loss of any real significance (2018 is about as bad as it got at a 4% loss). The traders that just set up an account in the last 12 months are even more jaded. The stock market recovered from a total shut down of the economy to provide a 17% gain on the S&P for the year of 2020.

If you are with me this far hoping for some interesting conclusion I don't have one. I don't know what the future brings. Timing the market is impossible. I am not saying we are doomed. I do think we are incredibly dependent and aware of the stock market moves nowadays. A year or two of actually bleeding losses in a bear market would be more devastating than it was in the past. Having all your losses occur in 60 days (Covid Crash) is not the same as buying dip after dip for 24 months only to have it move down further a week later. After 2020 people may even believe that if the stock market were to crash the government will always fix it. Even 2008 set the stage for that.

I will say a big help to the stock market is every retail investor that has come into the market in the last few years. More money in makes prices go up whether the company is worth more or not. Though those retail investors will leave a lot quicker than the retirement plans that typically made up the common persons stock market dollars in the past.

TL;DR Stocks don't always go up. Even if you wait an entire year.  


Edit: Yes given enough time stocks will go up. Inflation alone increases the dollar valuation of a company. This post is intended for those getting into the market over the last year or even couple of years. Believing that you will have the returns you have seen the last couple of years is not a good picture of the long term market. Even if you were in an index like the S&P 500. You may check your balance in 2024 and see the same balance you see today."

2021-03-12 20:44:06,Stocks,"Workhouse (WKHS) Class Action Lawsuit filed on behalf of investors ‚ÄúNEW YORK, March 09, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Gainey McKenna & Egleston announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against Workhorse Group Inc. (""Workhorse"") (NASDAQ:WKHS) in the United States District Court for the Central District of California on behalf of those who purchased or acquired the securities of Workhorse between July 7, 2020 and February 23, 2021, inclusive (the ""Class Period""). The lawsuit seeks to recover damages for investors under the federal securities laws.

The Complaint alleges that Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) the Company was merely hoping that USPS was going to select an electric vehicle as its Next Generation Delivery Vehicle, and had no assurance or indication from USPS that this was the case; (2) the Company had concealed the fact that -- as revealed by the postmaster general in explaining the ultimate decision not to select an electric vehicle -- electrifying the USPS's entire fleet would be impractical and astronomically expensive; and (3) as a result, Defendants' statements about Workhorse's business, operations, and prospects were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.

Investors who purchased or otherwise acquired shares of Workhorse during the Class Period should contact the Firm prior to the May 7, 2021 lead plaintiff motion deadline. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.  If you wish to discuss your rights or interests regarding this class action, please contact Thomas J. McKenna, Esq. or Gregory M. Egleston, Esq. of Gainey McKenna & Egleston.‚Äù

* **Strong quarterly figures and demand in Asia can lift shares even as investors shift to value names, analyst Dan Ives said.**

* [**Sign up here for our daily newsletter, 10 Things Before the Opening Bell**](https://newsletter.businessinsider.com/join/4np/10-things-opening-bell?utm_source=markets&utm_medium=ingest?utm_source=markets&utm_medium=ingest)**.**

The tech stocks that led the market higher in 2020 are faring worse this year. Wedbush sees it as a perfect opportunity to scoop up the group's biggest name.

Investors gearing up for a swift economic rebound have recently dumped growth stocks for riskier plays. The broad rotation to value stocks has dragged on tech mega-caps and sparked wild shifts between heavy selling and sudden dip-buying. While the Nasdaq composite notched a massive 3.7% gain on Tuesday, the biggest tech stocks still boast year-to-date losses.

The weakness sets up a ""great entry point"" for investors interested in [**Apple**](https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/aapl-stock?utm_source=markets&utm_medium=ingest), Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note. The firm added Apple to its ""best ideas"" list on Wednesday, praising the company's blowout December-quarter results and growth in Asia. After exceeding expectations for iPhone 12 sales, the iPhone 13 could be a ""game-changer"" that extends the upgrade ""supercycle"" for another year, Ives said.

""The recent sell-off creates a golden buying opportunity with a $3 trillion valuation on the horizon for Cupertino in our opinion,"" he added.

Wedbush reiterated its ""outperform"" rating with a $175 price target. The firm also holds a bull-case target of $225, which implies an 86% surge from Tuesday's closing level.

Wall Street expects Apple to ship roughly 220 million iPhones in the current fiscal year. Ives holds a considerably rosier outlook, instead projecting sales can rise to a record 250 million.

The bullish estimate is partially fueled by expectations for millions of current iPhone owners to upgrade their phones throughout the year. Some 350 million of the 950 million iPhones worldwide are due for an upgrade, according to Wedbush. The dynamic stands to prop up demand into the fall, Ives said.

The upgrade supercycle could even last through 2022 if iPhone 13 rumors prove true, the analyst added. Supply chain reports signal Apple initially aims to build 100 million units of the upcoming model, up from 80 million for the iPhone 12 lineup.

While this number is subject to change, the reports hint at ""an increased confidence with Cook & Co. that this 5G product cycle"" will continue into next year, Ives said.

Apple closed at $121.08 on Tuesday, down 9.4% year-to-date. The company has 81 ""buy"" ratings, 15 ""hold"" ratings, and three ""sell"" ratings from analysts."

So stock split today, my one contract became 10. And the stock went up 6%, that's really sweet, doubled the value. My question is, do stocks usually go up for multiple days after split? I'm debating whether to take profit. Anyone who experienced the TESLA split, can you share some advice? appreciate it."
2021-03-12 20:19:36,Stocks,"The Nasdaq may be looking at a low of 10% down (relative to today) Without making this too long, the losses aren‚Äôt over yet. Yields are a big deal, especially for tech stocks. Even if yields top out around where they were before COVID, that still leaves the Nasdaq around 35% higher than it was before Covid. That‚Äôs a big discrepancy. All of that 35% in gains has to be accounted for with any combination of the following 3 things:
- a) actual economic growth for tech stocks
- stock losses for tech stocks
- c) an increase in demand for tech stocks

In other words, if we knew for sure that tech did not grow and that demand was the same, that would guarantee 25% in losses to put the market back where it would otherwise be with identical financial conditions. In math terms, if we assume A and C constant then that means losses (B) have to make up the entire amount. Keep in mind percentages as amounts change: 35% in gains got us here but only approximately 25% in losses would negate it. Sounds weird but just do the math or trust me. 

Of course, we don‚Äôt actually know those things, and I am confident there was *some* real growth in the past year. The pandemic has significantly benefited tech in the real world. Working from home means a greater demand for a variety of services like computing and communication. However, not all of the growth is permanent. Not all, but some people will return to actual stores in lieu of e-retail. Some people will go to actual theaters, and go outside and thus spend less time on Netflix or Twitter. Overall, it‚Äôs tough to project actual tech sector growth of 35% for the period of Feb - Feb. 

There was also definitely an increase in demand due to the increase in money supply. So I am certain the losses won‚Äôt be the full 25% or even close. 

I can‚Äôt predict the sequence of events so it could be all at once or it could be spread out over the next few months. 

Tldr **But either way, there will be a lot of volatility and I would expect that 3 months from now the Nasdaq is around 5% down from where it is today.**"
2021-03-12 20:12:57,Stocks,"What are your thoughts on LULU ahead of earnings? So I‚Äôve personally been kind of surprised about the sell off recently so I‚Äôve been purchasing several shares when it dips below the 300s.

I‚Äôm considering buying some calls, because long term I‚Äôm fine holding the stock, because their tech fabric is so much more sophisticated than other brands and that I think they will grow mirror. 

As a consumer of the brand, I‚Äôm surprised at how the stock has been sliding (below $300 from almost $400 recently, which was more than the general tech sell off). Following that since earnings last time they‚Äôve released several colorways and items (align tank, scuba 1/2 zip) that they can‚Äôt keep in stock in addition to lowing their payroll, because all the seasonal workers have been laid off. Additionally, people buy a lot of athletic gear in the new year with people gaining weight in covid times compounds this and more gyms opening up. People working from home have also been stocking up on athletic wear. Lululemon remains cultish where people pay 2x retail for ‚Äúrare items‚Äù like recently some of the scuba 1/2 zips and align tanks, the subreddit and resellers still stalk drop times, and items sell out within a day.

2021-03-12 20:07:42,Stocks,"Stop comparing Roblox to Game Developers! I don't understand why people are choosing to compare Roblox mkt cap to game development companies. Roblox is not a game nor a game developer. 

Roblox is a platform with both development tools and a social media aspect linked to it... This is not DD and is only opinion but comparing Roblox to Activision is like Comparing Tesla to Ford. The comparison makes no sense and maybe people are trying to spread this FUD to lower their own point of entry to the stock but there is a reason why ARK bought 500k shares. 

Roblox should be compared to Facebook and other social platforms first and foremost. Then take a look at user growth in a website like Codecademy ... These are more accurate comparisons. 

People and news outlets comparing Roblox to a game developer that spits out one major title every 5-10 years and hopes they can retain their online multiplayer user base are not the same thing and do not look like they ever will be. 

This is not financial advice and I am not a financial advisor.

I can assure you however, that at this price I am confident RBLX is a great long term hold and if the price were to drop my only reaction would be to grab more shares. This company has unlimited potential where traditional games developers seem to be lagging."

2021-03-12 19:29:27,Stocks,"I've been doing a lot of reading but I can't seem to find info on the best plan for exiting a profitable PUT position I have a couple of put options on a stock that I believe is overpriced at the moment. I didn't spend much, just a few hundred play money. The upside is significant so I want to plan an exit strategy in case of any price swings that might happen while I'm in the gym or out. 

The option's value has dropped because the stock price has gone up a bit, but what happens if the stock price drops dramatically? Do I let it auto-exercise at end of day?

I've spent hours reading up on options exit strategy but most articles discuss the difference between offsetting, exercising, or letting your option expire worthless. For maximum profitability with highly volatile stock options, what's the best plan to have in place in case of dramatic swings in the underlying stock price?"
